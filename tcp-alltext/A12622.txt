            TO THE READER.
            Hauing written this Epistle of comforte to an espeaciall frende of myne, and not thincking at the first to lett it passe anye farther, not onlye the tyme, to whiche it principallye serueth, but the entreatye of diuerse, enforced me so farr, that I could not but condescende to the publishing of the same, though it cost me no smale labour in altering the style. Accept therfore (gentle reader) my good will, and hartye desire of thy comforte: And albeit (as thou wilt easelye by the reading perceyue) neyther the style, nor the conceipte, answereth to the wayt & importance of the subiect: Yet I hope, that thou shalt not finde it so barren, & fruitelesse, but that therin thou mayest gleane some eares of comfort, & picke some few crūmes for thy spirituall repast. And if through thy good disposition, & tendernesse of mynd, thou finde anye farther contentment therby, then of it selfe it would yelde; whatsoeuer thou demest prayse worthy, attribute it to the spiritt of that body, wherof I am an vnworthy mēber, & to which next vnto God I owe what good soeuer is in me. But if any thing be a misse, impute that to myne owne error, or ignorance. Thus wishinge thee, the full effecte which by reading hereof thou desirest, I cease to with holde thee with any longer preface.

            AN EPISTLE OF COMFORT TO THE REVERENDE PRIESTES, AND TO THE Honorable, Worshipfull, and other of the layesorte, restrayned in Durāce for the Catholike Fayth.
            IT hath bene alwayes a laudable custome in Gods Church, for such, as were afflicted in time of persecutiō, not onlye, by continuall prayer, and good works, but also by letters, & bookes, to comforte one an other. And although

                presumed, to be so especially lightened, and assisted by the holye Ghost, that the fountaine of spirituall delightes, was thought alwayes to lye open vnto them: yet because inward helpes are nothing preiudiced, yea rather abettered by externall motiues, I thought it no presumption to shew my reuerent affectiō towardes Gods prisoners, by presenting vnto thē this epistle of comfort. And though others haue

largely entreated of the same subiecte, and that in very forcible sorte: yet because where the same calamities are stil continued, the remedies agaynst them, can not be to often repeated, I deemed it not vnprofitable in this heate & seueritye of molestations, to employe some labour, in a thing of the lyke tenour. For as to the wayfaring pilgrim, wandering in the darke, and mistye night, euery light, though neuer so litle, is comfortable: & to the stranger, that traueyleth in a land of diuers language, any that can (though it be but brokenlye) speake his contrye tongue, doth not a litle reioyce him: So peraduenture in this foggye night of heresie, and the confusion of tongues, which it hath here in our Iland procured, this dīme light, which I shall set forth before you, and these my Catholicke, though broken speaches, which I shall vse vnto you will not be altogether vnpleasant. And though I maye saye with Tertullian,

                that as the sickest are most willing to talke of health, not for that they enioye it, but because they desire it: So I exhorte you to patience, rather as one, that

wold haue it: then as one that possesseth it: yet because somtimes a diseased Phisician maye prescribe helthsome phisicke, and a deformed engrauer carue a fayre image, I hope no man will blame me, if for my owne good and your comfort, I haue taken vpon me to addresse vnto you this short treatise. Wherein I will enlarge my selfe but in a few poyntes: which seeme vnto me the principall causes of consolation, to those that suffer in Gods quarell.

                     Luc: 7
                   Whē Mary Magdalen came to wash Christs feete with teares, and anoynt them with pretious oyntmente, there was a Simon to murmur at her, for the one, and a Iudas to reprehend the other, who notwithstanding spake not agaynst her, while she helde on her lewd and damnable course.

                   by killing theire babes: as Herode also thought to doe with Christ, when

he murdered the Innocents. The deuill hath his mastiues to garde his folde, that if anye escape out they maye presently barke & byte him with detractious slaunders; & if that will not serue, with heauier afflictions. Of these the Scripture sayeth,
                     Psal. 56
                   
                  Filij hominum, dentes corum arma et sagittae, et lingua eorum gladius acutus. The children of men their teeth are like swordes, and arrowes, & their tongue a sharpe blade. And thoughe they be verye vglye monsters, that in steede of teeth, and tongue, carye such murdering weapons, yett such are the deuils instruments, to persecute those, that recoyle from his seruice.

It is no disgrace to the sunne to be hated of the Ousell, and night byrdes, nor to the iewell to be trodden on, and not esteemed of the beasts. And so Aristippus, when one tolde him, that men despised him, answered, so do the bests them, making as litle account of their contempt, as they did to be contemned of the bestes.

Cedar, the worme, that can not breed in you, wilbe gnarring about you. It is the propertye of the deuill, and his instrumentes, to feede like storkes, vpon the venemous & euill actions of men, and they onlye take pleasure to see vs in sinne, and reioyce (if we amend) at our calamityes. And as Vultures, or rauens, though they strayte smell a dead cors, when it is corrupted, and drawe, vnto it by the vnsauery stench, in which their delight is: yet the sound bodyes, they neyther sent, not seeke out: So the wicked are readye to flocke about vs while we are in the stench of sinne, and corrupted with vice, because they them selues delight therin: Yet if we be soūd and hole, and haue cast from vs, that carryon, wherof they were eagre, they neyther smell vs nor seeke vs, yea rather auoyde vs and hate vs. The sauour of vertue striketh them dead, and though in the winter when the vyne was bare, they could lye vnder it, yett in the spring when it beginneth to flower, they lyke serpents are stroken dead with the sent therof: and therfore no maruell, though they mortally hate it.

                   it beareth you malice. Saint Basill recoūteth of his owne experiēce, that the Libard beareth such a furious hatred vnto man, that it sodeynly at the sight of him, flyeth in his face, and to auoyde the rage therof, the custome is to shew vnto it a mans picture, in a paper, which it presently rendeth and teareth asunder, shewing therbye, how eagrelye it is bent agaynst mā him selfe, whose image it can not abyd. Euen so is it in the deuill and his followers, who not being able to wreacke their malice agaynst almightye God, whom they especyally hate, they turne their spite agaynst gods image, that is mans soule, and so much the more enuiouslye seeke the ouerthrow of it, the more they see it to waxe like vnto God, not onlye in nature, but also in goodnesse. When we come to the seruice

of Christ we come to a rough profession, that is bound to haue continuall defiance and enimtye, with the pleasures, vanityes, and prayses of this worlde, and therfore can we looke for nothinge els at theire handes, that are friendes to the same, but onlye trouble, hatred, and persecution.

we maye be hartelye glad, if after long teares, and deepe syghes, we maye in the ende fynde him at all, whether it be in the pouertye of the cribb and maū

                   that his diuine prowesse & generositye is set forth in his childrēs actes, & prayses. Nether doth this comforte consiste, to see in vs a shadowe of his beautye, a sparke of his wisdome, or a resemblāce of his might, riches, or glorye: but rather in seinge in vs, the scares, wēmes and werttes of his vexations and paynes: which the more they deface vs in outwarde shew, the more they beautifye vs in soule, and the more vglye and odious they make vs in the mistakinge of mans eye, the more amiable they render vs, in the sight of god. For as the scarre of a woū
                  de in the childes face, which he hath suffered in his fathers quarell, though it make his countenance lesse eyesome, & disfigure his fauour, yet is it a more edginge whetstone, of fatherlye affection in the parent, then if it were absent,

because it yeldeth, a perpetuall testimonye of a dutifull and louinge mynde. So god more desirous to haue vs affectionate, then fortunate children, delighteth more to see our torturings, rackinges, cheynes and imprisonments, for his sake, which are assurāces of our loue, then to see vs swimme in his temporall guiftes, and pryseth more the Niniuire in his sackcloth, and disfigured Iob in his dunghill, then eyther of them in all the pompe and glorye of their riches. For as S. Gregorye noteth:
                     Greg. in moral.
                   
                  Amissio felicitatis interrogat vim dilectionis. Nec prosperitas quippe amicum indicat, nec aduersitas inimicum cela

                   And as S. Ciprian also sayth: Delicata iactatio est, cum periculum non est, conflictatio in aduersis, probatio est veritatis. It is an effeminat bost, when there is no perill, the combate in aduersity is a triall of the truth.

And if they at a wordes warninge, to so open hazarde, ventured them selues, for a vayne contentmēt of their Captaynes, and in hope of a sorye reward, nothing comparable to their perill, how much more ought we, beinge chalenged to the fielde, by gods enemyes, giue our heauenlye Captayne a profe of our loyaltye, and perfitt remonstrance, of our seruiceable myndes, by waginge in spirituall battayle with his foes, and most readilye encountring them, in his quarell, with what daunger soeuer. we see, that an enamored knight hath no greater felicitye, then to doe that, which maye be acceptable to his paramour, and the fadinge beautye, of a fayre Ladyes

quo auerti cadere, in quem conuertiresurgere, in quo manere consistere est. Deusa quo exire mori, in quem redire reuiuiscere, in quo habitare viuere est. Deus quem nemo amittit, nisi deceptus, nemo quaerit, nisi admonitus, nemo inuenit, nisi purgatus: God is the true and chiefest lyfe, in whom, from whom, & by whom, are all good thinges, whatsoeuer they be, that are happye to enioye. From whom the reuolting is fallinge, to whom the returning is risinge, in whom the stayinge is sure standinge. God from whom to depart, is to dye, to whom to repayre, is to reuiue, in whom to dwell is to liue. God whome none leeseth, but deceyued, none seeketh but admonished, none findeth but the clensed.

                  dulce non est. Quicquid vult dare dominus meus, auferat totū, et se mihi det. Whatsoeuer is not god is not pleasant, and

whatsoeuer my Lord will vouchsafe vppon me, let him take awaye all, and geue me him selfe. Shall the presence of his picture, wherin he is but verye rudelye expressed, make vs lauishe of our wealth, carelesse of our libertye, and prodigall of our lyues? And shall not he, whom the picture representeth, woe vs to as much readinesse in his affayres? Can we to please his shadowe, delighte in daunger, embrace dishonour, triumph in our harmes: And care so litle for him, that casteth it as not to thincke him more worthye of the lyke affection? Are we so eagre, licorous, and plyable, to those colours, eates, and fashions, that a base creature of his liketh: and shall not the fauours, foode, and attyre, of our creator, be as acceptable vnto vs? Finallye shall we take no exception, agaynste the faults, wordes, and deeds, of a frayle, & faultye wretch: & not be as much moued, with the vertues, sayings, and examples of an vnfallible trueth. What is the fayrest creature in the worlde, but an imperfecte counterfaite, and onlye a vayne shadow of gods soueraigne beutye,

and maiestye. If therfore with the naturall peyse of affection, we sincke so deepe into the liking therof, according to that of S. Augustine Amor meus pondus meum,

                  illo feror quocūque feror. My loue is my loade, with that am I caried, whether soeuer I am caried: Much more oughte we to be deepely rauished, with the loue of god, and so settle our myndes therin, that we thincke it our chiefest happynesse in this lyfe, to embrace all hazardes, disgraces, & misfortunes in his quarell, and then to haue moste cause of comforte, when for his glory, we are in moste bitter panges. For as S. Gregorye noteth.

                  Amor dei otiosus non est, operatur enim magna, si est, si operari renuerit, amor non est. The loue of god is not idle, it worketh greate effectes, where it is, if it refuse to worke, loue it is not. And so much the more ought we to reioyce in our passions for Christe, in that we haue bene so tenderlye beloued of him, that whatsoeuer we suffer for him, it is lesse then he suffered for vs. And whatsoeuer we spende in his behalfe we restore him but his owne, & are neuer able to come out of debte, though

we had as many liues to spend, as droppes of bloode to shedd. For as S. Bernard sayeth.

For though I coulde repaye my selfe a thousande tymes, what am I in comparison of my Lorde. O harde and stonye harte, that is not incensed, at the consideration of so inflamed loue, and beinge woed of so louinge a spouse, can reiecte this offer, or be slacke in recognisinge

so vnspeakable charitye. For as S. Augustine sayeth. Nulla maior est ad amorem inuitatio,

                  quam praeuenire amantem, & nimis durus est animus, qui si dilectionem nolebat impendere, nolit rependere. There is no greater entisement vnto loue, then to preuente the louer, and to harde is that harte, that if it woulde not request loue is not contente at the least to requite it. And where was euer any, that eyther sought so much, or bought so deare, the loue of anye creature, as Christ did ours: What hath a man more then riches, honor, & lyfe, and all this did Christ spend in woinge our soules. As for his riches, he was borne and dyed naked, concerninge his honor, he was sorted, and executed with theeues, touchinge his life, he was bereued therof, by a most vylde & dispytefull death. Let vs but consider, the last tragicall pageant of his Passion, wherein he wōne vs, and lost him selfe. And marke the excessiue loue shewed therin, which if anye other then god had vttered, it would haue been at the least deemed a senselesse dotage, waying by whome, and to whome it was intended. Let vs

view him with the eyes of our harte, & and we shall (sayeth S. Bernard) discouer a most lamentable sight:

Loue the loue of him, that for the loue of thy loue, descended into the wombe of a Virgine, and afterward ascēded to the ignominy of the Crosse, that there he mighte couple his loue, and thy loue together. What Christian harte, can thincke much to suffer, beyng moued with this example, yea who woulde not glorye with S. Paule, in his infirmities, and take greatest comforte in his desolations, seynge the most louinge & faythfull spouse of our soule, hath thus sweetned all our paynes, with the excesse of his vnspeakable charitie, and geuen vs such a presidente in suffering for vs, as it must needs seeme litle, whatsoeuer we suffer for him: Shall the loue of a mortal friend, not only a moue vs, but enforce vs, to loue him agayne, and his perils for vs, make vs eagre of perils for him, because therbye both our loue to him, is best witnessed, and his loue to vs most confirmed, and shall not this loue of an imortall welwiller,

who tendereth vs more then we our selues, and in all respectes better deserueth to haue his loue counteruayled, shall it not I saye be able to inflame vs, with desire to suffer for him, & to testifye our affection with continuinge the same in the middest of our tormentes if need so require. We see a dogge that is voyde of reason, by onlye instinct of nature, readye for hauinge receyued a bone, or a crust of breade, to runne vpon the sword, in his maisters defēce. We thincke it the dutye of our seruant, if we geue him but fortye shillings in the yeare, to hazarde him selfe in our perils, to fight in our quarels, and we condemne him as an vngratefull miscreant, if he stand not betweene vs and our enemyes, as a buckler of our blowes, though the daunger be neuer so apparant. And shall a christian harte, be eyther more vnnaturall then a beast, or lesse thākfull thē a hired seruant? shal a crust of breade preuayle more with a brute thinge, or a litle money with a hyrelinge, then with vs the foode of Angels, wherwith Christ hath fedd vs, then his precious bloode, wherwith he

hath bought vs, then eternall felicity, wherwith he will rewarde vs? Yea and shall men be so readye to serue the deuill, that we see thousands euery daye, carelesse to cast awaye both bodye and soule, in followinge his trayne, & shall we to serue our omnipotent, and louing Lord, refuse to venture our goods, or bodyes, with so vnestimable benefitt, and vantage of our soules?

                  S. Ciprian sayeth. When Christ in the daye of Iudgement shall shew him selfe, & laye open to the worlde, the benefits which he hath bestowed, the rewardes which he hath promised, the tormentes and paynes which he hath suffered for man, then shall the deuill on the other syde, most greeuouslye charge vs, and saye vnto god: Loe how much more right I haue in man thē thou. I neuer loued him, and yet he serued me. I neuer did him good turne, & yet he obeyed me. Without woing or wages I easely wōne him. What I suggested, he performed, whatsoeuer I profered, he imbraced. No perils could stopp, when I allured, no feare, or loue of thee coulde moue him, to abandon and forsake me For

obteyning a vayne pleasure, he hath yelded to most seruyle drudgerye, to please an appetite, he hath contemned all gods and mans punishmentes, & hath bene readye to venture libertye, liuing, creditt, yea lyfe and limme, for the atchiuinge a delighte, that I cast in his fantasie. And yet did he vndoubtedlye beleeue, that in steed of thy loue, I bare him implacable malice, in steede of thy sufferinge tormentes for him, I desired to be his eternall tormentour, & wheras thou didest promise eternall felicity, I coulde afforde him, nor wishe him, anye thing, but endlesse damnation. Yet coulde not this (though foreseene and thought of) withdrawe him from me, but still he was readye to be drawne with my lore, and so soone as I set him anye seruice to doe, he forthwith putt it in executiō. On the other syde, what hast thou preuayled with the miseries of thy poore natiuitye, with the grie

                  e and shame of thy paynfull circuncision, with thy three and thirtye yeares pilgrimage, bestowed in his seruice? Hath thy fastinge, or prayinge, thy whippinge, or crowninge, thy bloodye death, or passion,

bene able to counteruayle my suggestions? Hath not for all this, my motions bene sooner obeyed then thy preceptes, & my will preferred before thy commaundementes? If therfore I haue ruled him, reason it is that I should rewarde him: And if with me he contemned thy mercye, with me also, lett him feele thy seueritye. In this maner shall the deuill accuse vs, & happye is he, that in this lyfe hath so testified his loue, by his patience, in gods cause, & willing sufferance of aduersitye, that he maye eyther preuent the accusatiō, or be prouided of a sufficient answere. Consideringe therfore how glorious, how decent, yea and necessarye it is for a Christian, to take vp his crosse with Christ, and tread the path of tribulatiō, which he hath playned vnto vs, by his owne example: lett vs not be dismayde with these crosse aduentures, that befall vs, lett not the crueltye of our enemyes, the sharpnesse of our miseries, the continuance of our afflictions, daunt our courage in gods cause. We are not better then our maister, who suffered farr more, nor wiser then god him selfe who

iudged and embraced the distresses of this worlde, as fittest for the passengers therof. Finally we are Christians, whose captayne is a crucifixe, whose stendard the Crosse, whose armoure patience, whose battayle persecution, whose victorye death, whose triumphe martirdome.

Consider O man, (sayeth S. Bernard) from whence thou comest, and blushe whether thou goest, and feare where thou liuest, and lamente. We are begotten in vncleanesse, nourished in darkenesse, brought forth with throbbs and throwes. Our infancye is but a dreame, our youth but a madnesse, our manhode

a combate, our age a sicknesse, our lyfe miserye, our death horror. If we haue anye thing that, delighteth vs, it is in so manye hazardes, that more is the feare of leasinge it, then the ioye of the vse of it. If we haue anye thing that annoyeth vs, the agreuance therof increaseth, with the doubt of as euill or worse that maye strayte ensue after it. Which waye can we cast our eyes, but that we shall finde cause of complaynt, and heauinesse. If we looke vp towardes heauen, from thence we are banished: If we looke tawards earth, we are there imprisoned: On the right hand we haue the sayntes, whose steppes we haue not followed: On the left hand, the wicked, whose course we haue pursued: Before vs we haue our death readye to de

the fallinge, gott holde by a little tree, and setled his feete on a weake staye, & thus thought him selfe verye secure. But looking a litle better about him, he espyed two myse, one whyte, and an other blacke, that continually laye gnawing a sunder the roote of the tree, which he helde bye, vnderneth him a terrible Dragon, with open iawes ready to deuoure him, at the staye of his feete, he found fower adders, that issued out of the wall, and after all this lifting vp his eye, he espyed vpon one of the bowes of the tree, a litle honye: He therfore vnmyndfull of all his daungers, not remembringe that aboue the Vnicorne wayted to spoyle him, that beneath the fierye Dragon watched to swallowe him, that the tree was quicklye to be gnawen asunder, that the stay of his feete, was slipperye, and not to truste vnto: Not remembring I saye all these perils, he onlye thought, how he might come by that litle honye.

The deuill trusteth much vpon the helpe of the fleshe, because a housholde enemye is apter to hurte. The fleshe, also hath entered league with him, and conspired to my subuersion, beinge borne, and nourished in sinne, defiled from her beginnynge, but much more corrupted by euill custome. Hereuppon it is, that so egrelye she coueteth agaynst the spirite, that so daylye she murmureth, impatiente of disciplyne, that she suggesteth wickednesse, disobeyeth reason, & is not rastrayned with feare. The crooked serpente enemye of mankynde, to her ioyneth his force, her he helpeth, her he vseth, and he hath no other desyre,

no other businesse, no other studye, but to cast awaye our soules. This is he that alwayes endeuoreth mischiefe, that speaketh sub

By which wordes of S.

So manye persecutions daylye doth our mynde suffer, with so manye perils is our breast assaulted, and can it delighte vs to make longe abode amongst these swordes of the deuill? Moreouer if we consider our body what it is, how britle, how frayle, how subiect to corruption, how full of horrible diseases, stuffed with lothsome excrementes, miserable in lyfe, and abhominable after death: how can we take pleasure in a foūtaine of so much paine, or not fynde a tediousnes, to serue, and of necessitye to feede, so noysome a thinge. But of all other miseryes, that deserue to be lamented, there is one that passeth al the rest, and is of it selfe, though ther were none but it, able to crosse all possible comfortes, and to

make him that semeth meriest, to spend daye and night in weepinge, and complaynte. We haue but one poore and sillye soule, our onlye treasure and Iewell, in whose custodye consisteth our welfare, with whose losse ensueth all our discomforte. A soule of noble substance, of exceedinge beautye, inspired by God the Father, redeemed by the sonne, sanctified by the holye Ghoste, and endewed with the Image of the whole Trinitye. A soule created to liue with Angels, to enioye the loue and companye of an eternall spouse, to be a citizen of heauen, to enherite a kingdome, and triumphe in royall dignitie. This soule I saye, is not only exiled from her natiue coūtrye, like a caytiue, fettered in a most filthye dungeon, like a forlorne & left widow depriued of her spouses felowshipp, & in most lamētable sort debarred from her kingdome: but is so perilouslye besett, with the fore-resited enemyes, that it standeth in continuall hazarde, to encrease her presente miserye, with an eternall losse, and in liew of all her honours, endowmentes, and dignityes, that she was created vnto, to

reape euerlasting horror, and punishment. O fearefull and vncomfortable case, of which ther is no cure. O harde and heauye daunger, that receyueth no security, whose easiest and only remedy, is the seueringe of soule and bodye asunder. Thryse happye are the Martirs, whose bloodye agonyes, purchase assurance of happines, and acquite them from all perill of ensewing tormentes. And thryse vnhappy is our estate, whose hope of felicitye hangeth, on so tickle and slipperye termes: For as S. Augustine sayeth Lubrica spes qua inter fomenta peccati saluari se sperat,
                  
                     Aug. lib. de singula. clericor.
                   
                  Incerta victoria est, inter hostilia arma pugnare: et impossibilis liberatio est, flammis circundari, et non arderi. It is a slipperye hope, that amonestg so manye nourishmentes of sinne, looketh to be saued: vncertayne is the victorye, when it is fought for amongst the enemyes weapons, and vnpossible (in a maner) is the deliuery frō burning, where we are compassed in with flames. And as S. Bernard well noteth,

                   and till such time as our soule is deliuered like a sparrowe out of the foulers snares. We read that the strumpet which came for iudgment to Salomon,
                  
                     1. Reg. 3.
                   when she harde him call for a sworde, and cōmaund, that her litle childe should be parted into two peeces, she presentlye fell into so vehement a passion of sorow, that Commota sunt viscera eius super filio, her bowels were moued for pitye of her sonne. We reade that Agar beinge driuen out of Abrahams house,
                     Gen. 21.
                   and enforced to wander in the wildernesse, with her

                  le innocent geue vpp the ghost: she withdrew her selfe a farr of from it, and with pitifull mone

and lamentation lyfted vpp her voyce to heauen, feedinge her pensiue and timorous thoughtes, with the dolfull remembraunce, and continuall feare of her childes departure. We see what cold and trembling agonyes, surpryse the poore wretch, that pleadeth at the barr, whyle the Iurye deliberateth vpon his finall sentence. We see how doubtfully the sicke patient hangeth in suspence, betweene hope and feare, whyle the phisicians are in consultatiō, whether his disease be mortall. Finallye if a younge spouse tenderlye affected, and deeplye enamoured vpon her new husbande, see him assaulted by fierce and cruell enemyes, or inforced to wage in a whote & daungerous battayle, what a multitude of frightfull passiōs oppresse her, how variablye is she tossed vp and downe, with crosse and fearfull surmises. Of euery gunne that is discharged, she feareth that the pellett hath hitt his bodye, ere the noyse came to her eares, at euerye worde that is reported of anye that are slayne, feare maketh her doubt that her best-beloued is one. Euerye rumour costeth her a teare, euerye

suspicion a pange, and till she see the battayle ended, and her husbande safely returned, she hangeth betweene life & death, drawing euery thing to sorowful constructions, & vtterly refusing all kynde of comforte. O how harde and tough harted are we, towarde our owne soules, that seeinge them in all the rehersed daungers, feele not in our selues, any motiō of the like affections. The sword of gods iustice hangeth ouer our soules, ready for our sins to diuyde vs from eternall blysse, and vncertayne it is, whether he will geue not onlye a parte, but the whole to the foule fiend, that hath so often through our iniquityes, stolne vs from our mothers syde, into his enuious handes, and shall not we be moued with pitye and griefe. We are from paradyse exiled with Agar, into this barren deserte, and can not certaynelye assure our selues, that we haue so much as one dropp of grace to slake and mitigate the thirsting passions, which without it vndoubtedlye worke the death of our soules, and our finall damnation. And can we seeinge not our childe, but the chiefe portion

of our selues, in such a taking, with drye eyes and vnnaturall hartes beholde it, without sorowe? Are not we to stande at the barre in the daye of Iudgment, where the deuils, our consciences, and all creatures shall giue most strayte information agaynst vs? The twelue Apostles as our quest, & Christ as our Iudge, whome we haue daylye offended, shall passe their verdicte in moste rigorous sorte vppon vs, and that about our eternall death, and saluation: And can we vntil we here, what wil become of vs, doe otherwyse but lyue in continuall feare and perplexitye? Is not our soule in this bodye, as a Lazar in death-bed, vncertayne of life so long as it couched therin, yea in apparent daunger of an endlesse death, and shall not we till we heare the iudgment of our heauenlye phisician, who can quicklye search, and onlye can enter into our diseases, trē
                  ble, quake & feare a hard resolutiō? Finallye is not our most beutiful & noble portiō, of which the body hath al the seemlinesse, without which it strayte becommeth vglye, and monstrous: Is it not I saye in the thronge and presse of most

powrable, subtile, and barbarous enemyes, hauing continuall warre, not onlye agaynst fleshe & bloode,
                  
                     Ephesi. 6.
                   
                  but also agaynst the princes and powers, agaynst the rulers of the worlde of this darcknesse. Is it not also set the in reach of many occasiōs, allurementes, and prouocations vnto sinne. And can we seeinge this doe any thing, but morne and liue in continuall anguish and pensiuenesse, vntill we see the battayle ended, and our soule safely deliuered out of daunger. O senselesse and benummed hartes of ours, that at the consideration of so heauye and lamentable poyntes, can not fynde scope and fielde of sorowe. Lett vs at the lest be sorye for our want of sorowe, and bewayle our scarcitye of teares, lest we fall into a carelesse securitye, and by not sorowing as we should, leaue considering for how great causes we ought. For as S. Gregorye noteth.
                     Greg. L. 8. mor
                   
                  Saepe quod torpentes latuit, fletibus innotescit, & afflicta mens certius inuenit malum, quod fecerat, et reatum suum cuius secura non meminit, hunc in se cōmota depraehendit. Oftentimes that which we knowe not through our sloth, we learne by teares, and an afflicted

mind more certainly findeth a cō
                  mitted fault, & the guilt which in securitie it remēbred not, being troubled it espyeth. And seeing that on euerye syde we haue such vrgent occasiōs to morne and passe the dayes of this our paynfull pilgrimage in griefe and heauinesse, we must rather content our selues in tribulation, then in repose, seeinge by the first we are but inuited to weeping and sorowe, which is the thinge that we should professe, and by the last to comfort and solace, which with reason the eminent daungers and straytes that we stand in, will not comporte. Which both of Christ and his saintes hath ben so well vnderstood, that Christ, though it had bene as easye for him, to haue bene borne an Emperour, & haue had all the pleasures that heauen and earth could yelde, yet would he not in the vale of teares, geue so preposterous an example, of myrth. But as one that knew whether he came, he entered into the worlde weepinge, and in tyme of his aboade with vs, lyued lyke an outwayle, and morner, & in his death, tooke his leaue with teares & tormēts.

What his Saintes haue done, lett all antiquitye testifie, how like men that had no feelinge of worldlye comfort, they roued in deserts, lodged in desolate holtes, and caues, were cloathed with heare and sackcloth, fedd very litle and groslye, chastised their bodyes often and seuerelye: endeuouringe to keepe them selues alwayes in remembraunce, that they were mourners: And therfore choosinge place, habyte, dyet, & exercyse, fittest for that dolfull professiō. The Sayntes knew, that heauen onlye was Terra viuentium,
                  
                     Psal. 14.
                   a lande of the liuinge, and that in this worlde we sitt, In tenebris,

                  et in vmbra mortis, in darkenesse, and the shadowe of death, and therfore they wyselye iudged, that musica in luctu importuna,
                  
                     Eccles. 22
                   vnfittinge it is to haue myrthe, and musicke, in tyme of sorowe. They sawe (no doubt) the tree of this lyfe, loaden with some alluringe and delicious fruites: but consideringe that it grew in such a place, as the clyminge vnto it, implyed manifest daunger of falling into the bottomlesse pitt of hell, they lefte it as a praye for the raueninge foule of this world, contenting

them selues with the bitter frutes of aduersitye. They knew that only in the arriuall to heauen,
                     Psal. 123
                   
                  In exultatione metent portantes manipulos suos, They shall reape in ioye bearing their handfuls, and therfore here all the waye, Euntes ibant etflebant mittentes semina sua, they went weepinge sowinge their seedes in sorowe. They knew that who will keepe the feast in heauen, must first keepe the vigill and the fast here. For otherwyse he that will feast it here in ioconsye and disporte, after this lyfe, ad sepulchra ducetur et in congerie mortuorum vigilabit.

                   They obserued that as S. Basill sayeth, the huge and noble cityes furnished with glory of munition, with aucthoritye of great personages, and all plenty both at home and abroade, at the length shew in the onlye ruines the signes of their auncient nobilitye: The shipp also that hath often escaped many shipwrackes, & a thousand tymes crossed the seas with great aduātage of the shipmē, in the end iustled with a blast, is shattered in peeces.
Mightye armyes

that haue often cōquered in warr, haue afterward bene made a miserable and bloodye spectacle to their enimies. All nations & Ilandes enhaunced to great power & swaye, haue decayed in time, or chaunged their libertye, with bondage. Finallye what hauocke, losse, ruyne, or miserye can be reckened, wherof this wretched world hath not shewed some example?
yea and that in the lyfe of the godlye. All thinges therfore bendinge here to decaye, and beinge taynted with deathes consūption. The Sayntes in mourninge sorte, agreablye to dyinge and passing persons, liued in a continuall farewell, as men that all wayes stoode vpon the departure from these earthlye solaces: litle regardinge the thinges, that they were to leaue, and hauinge their hartes setled vpon the felicity, that they tended vnto. And as men, that at noone daye, desire to see the starres, goe downe into a deepe and darke well, from thence the easier to discrye them: so they desyring to haue the eyes of their harte, perpetuallye fixed vppon the starres of heauen, that is the glorye of the Sayntes, descended in

to that profounde, obscure, and base kynde of lyfe, sequestring them selues from the lyght and pleasure of these inferior comfortes, yea and delyghtinge in griefes, the better to conceaue of future happynes.

                   Well maye we to these saye with S. Augustine. Quo

itis? peritis & nescitis, non illac itur quo pergitis, quo peruenire desideratis. Nam vtique beati esse desideratis: Sed misera sunt, & ad maiorem miseriam ducunt, itinera ista quae curritis. Tam magnum bonum querere per mala nolite, si ad illud peruenire velitis huc venite hac ite. Whether goe you, you perishe and you perceyue it not, that is not the waye to the place you goe vnto, and to which you desire to arryue: for your meaninge is to be happye, but miserable are they, and to more miserye leade they, those iorneyes which you runne: seeke not so greate a good by euill. If you meane to atchiue it, hyther must you come, & this waye must you goe. The path to heauen is narrowe, rough, and full of weerisome and tyeringe ascents, neyther can it be trodden without greate toyle. And therfore wronge is their waye, grosse their error, and assured their ruine, that after the steppes and testimonyes of so manye thousand Sayntes, will not learne wherto settle their footinge. It were enough to haue the example of Christe onlye, who as S. Augustine noteth cryeth alwayes vnto vs.
                     August.
                   
                  Qua vis ire, ego sum via.

Quo vis ire ego sum veritas. Vbi vis permanere, ego sum vita. Which waye wilt thou goe, I am the waye. Whether wilt thou goe, I am the truth. Where wilt thou staye, I am the lyfe.

What hath our whole lyfe bene, but a continuall defiance & battayle with God. Our senses so manye swordes to fyght agaynst him, our wordes blowes, and our workes woundes.

What hath it ben, but a forge of Satan, wherin the fyer of our passions, kindled with his wicked instinctes, he hath enflamed our soule, and made it so plyable to his purposes, that vppon the Anduyle of euerye pleasure, and sensuall delighte, he hath wrought it to most vglye and detestable shapes. And as for the soule that was betrothed and espoused to Christ in baptisme, that was beutified with grace, fedd with the repast of Angels, and a treasurye for all gods riches: that was a receyte of the blessed Trinitie, and ordeyned to the felowshipp of Angels in eternall blisse.

Finallye what parcell of our bodye, what power of our soule, wherof god hath giuen vs the vse, haue we not abused to his dishonour: warring agaynst him with his owne weapons, & employing our lyfe, motion, and beinge, to the continuall incensynge of him,

The deuill in his nature is more amiable thē man, beinge of nobler substance, of higher excellencye, and endewed with higher prerogatiues, then we. Yett who knoweth not, how muche God doth hate him. We knowe what tender affection God hath alwayes shewed to mankind, for whose sake he hath made this world, and enriched and garnished it with so glorious ornaments, besydes other infinite tokens of a moste tender loue, howerlye shewed vnto vs. And yett it is sayed.

When we will make a comparison of a thing that is euill, in the highest degree, we can fynde nothing to lyken it vnto, worse then the deuill: And when we haue named him, we thincke to haue reckened the last, and greatest euill, that can be imagined. For the which cause,

Seinge therfore this most monstrous and abhominable sinne was as well in vs, as in the deuill, we maye rather thincke our selues happye, that we are not chastised as he is, then marueyle that wee are afflicted as now we be; espeacially consideringe, that which S. Ans

then in the deuill him selfe. For his sinne was but one: ours infinite. His before the reuenge of sinn was knowen, ours after notice, and experience therof. He sinned created in inocency, we restored to the same. He persisted in malice beinge of God reiected: but we beinge of God recalled. He was harden

Moreouer as it is a straunge & most dreadfull darknesse, that no light can illuminate; and an extreame colde, that no heate can rebate; So must it be a moste odious thing, that an infinite loue hateth, and the baddest thing that can be that an infinite goodnesse detesteth, and a most vyld & execrable thing that omnipotencye can not doe. For if there were in it anye sparke or iott of goodnesse, God could not otherwyse doe, but in some respecte loue it, approue it, and be aucthor of it. And syth

we so long haue suffered this vglye and filthye deformitye, to sticke and fester in vs, and consequently haue ben most abhominable, and lothsome in Gods eye, what rubbing, what rough intreatye, or harde vsage can we thincke to much, to scoure out so canckred a corruption. For as S. Bernard sayeth.
                     Bern. in quod. Serm.
                   
                  Qui perfecte senserit onus peccati, aut parum sentiet, aut ex toto non sentiet corporis paenam, nec magnum reputabit, quo pcecata nouerit deleri praeterita, & caueri futura. He that perfectlye feeleth the burden of sinne, and the hurte of the soule, eyther shall litle, or nothing at all, feele the punishment of his body, nor esteeme it much, whereby he knoweth his former offences to be canceled, and his future sinns to be preuented. But because the consideratiō of that, which our sinnes haue deserued, is a most forcible motiue, to disgest with patience what miserye soeuer, though otherwise very tedious: Let vs call vnto mynde, how God mighte iustly haue delte with vs, what he might haue layde vppon vs, and yett not only not exceeded, the bond of his iustice, but haue still shewed himselfe of infinite

mercye. It is a generall Axiome, and an approued veritye, ratified by the common consent of all fathers, and diuines, that as God rewardeth aboue the deserts of our merites, & in his eternall recompence farr exceedeth the valew of our good works, so on the other syde, doth he chastise farr vnderneth the rate of our mysdeedes, and his infinite iustice considered, his greatest punishment amounteth not, to the exceeding heynousnesse of the lest mortall sinne. For the iniurye offered to so infinite a maiestye of one so farr inferiour, & so highlye beholding vnto him, in so opprobrious and despytefull wyse, that as much as in the sinner lyeth, he quite defeateth God of his godhead, and yeldeth it to that wherin he sinneth: This iniurye (I saye) is so greate, that though God shoulde double and treble all punishmentes of sinne, and lay thē on one sinners backe, for one on lye mortal offence, yett might he iustly double them of new, and as often as he thought good, without doing anye iniurye to the offendor; yea and punishing him farr lesse, then his desert were.

Lett vs now therfore consider, what rigorous punishmentes God hath vsed, in reuenging him selfe vppon sinners. First if we marke what temporall miseryes cōmon to all men, God hath caused in the worlde, for one onlye sinne of Adam; They will seeme so manye, as might suffise yea and exceede the iust measure of the desert of that sinne. For if man had perseuered in the state of innocencye, nether should our bodyes haue ben subiect to anye diseases, nor the minde to anye sorowe or disordred passions. The earth should haue ben a place of pleasure, the ayre temperate, all creatures to man obedient, finallye all thinges to our contentment, & nothing to our annoyance. If therfore we consider now the miseryes of our bodyes, as hunger, thirst, nakednesse, deformitye, sickenesse, and mortallitye; the troubles of our mynde, as phansies, feares, perplexityes, anguishes, & diuers imperfections: likewyse the generall scourges of plagues, warre, a thousand hazardes and calamityes,: Finally all other incombrances, that in any respect ar incident into this lyfe, they are

so manye in number, so greeuous in qualitye, and so ordinary in experience to all, that who so well wayeth them, might thinke them sufficient scourges, not onlye of one, but of all the sinnes of mankynde. Doe but cast your eyes into one hospitall of lazars. See what cankers, fistuloes, vlcers, and rottings, what wolfes, sores, and festered carbucles. Wey the miseries of the phrensye, palsey, letargy, falling sicknesse, and lunasye. Consider the diseased of the eyes, eares, mouth, throate, and euerye parcell of mans bodye. On the other syde consider the infirmityes of the mynde, the furious rages, enuyes, rancours, and corrasiues, the vnplacable sorowes, and desperate passions, the continuall hell, tormentes, and remorse of conscience, and infinite other spritishe fittes, and agonyes. Consider the displeasure of superiours, the malice and enmitye of our equalles, the contempt, ignominy, and reproch, we receyue of our inferiours, the fraude and trecherye of all sortes and degrees. Goe forwarde to the other ordinarye molestations, by losse of goodes, lymmes, libertye, frindes,

wyfe, or children. By daungers of fyer, water, sword, beastes, and infinite of lyke qualitye. And remembring that all these thinges, and the defeating of the commodityes & pleasures contrarye to the same, befell vnto man by reason of one, and that in shew but a light sinne; Lett vs not thincke much if we, whose offences are most greeuous, and verye many, suffer a few of these scourges, and those such, as compared with diuers other afore recyted, haue in respecte of them, scarce anye colour or shadow of miserye. What sinne haue we committed, that maye not be deemed as exorbitant as the eating of an aple: and how manye haue we done, that seeme farr more detestable? why then shoulde we not, eyther looke for the whole heape of afflictions to light vppon vs, or at the lest, the most noysome and greuous that are emongest them: which God of his mercye, not hauing permitted, but layed a softe and easye hande vppon vs, more cause we haue of thankes giuinge, then of anye iuste complaynte. But to passe to other particuler scourges, that God hath sent in

this lyfe, for the diuers sinnes and offences of men, we shall fynde them so manye, so terrible, and so vntollerable, as the very imagination of them without the experience, were able to affryght a right couragious, and stoute harte. In the scriptures what straunge punishmentes reade we, of the deluge of Noe,

tyrantes, what spoyle of their goods, shedding of their bloode, oppressing of innocentes, persecutions of the Godly, deflowring of virgins, Abusing of matrones, compulsion vnto wickednesse, and terrifyinge from all vertue. What inconueniences and miseryes haue insued by warr, what alteration of estates, subuersiō of Kingdomes, slaughtering of men, destroying of cittyes, and confusion of all order.

                   And to put one example what a tragicall & straunge vengeance, did God shew vnto the Iewes, for their horrible sinne in murdering Christ, at the last destruction of Hierusalem. To omit their rifling, and spoyle by diuerse roman magistrates, their seruilitye vnder straungers, the surprising of other cittyes of Iurye, & the driuing all the inhabitants into that one cittye of Hierusalem: the onlye taking of it was the occasion of suche miseryes, that were they not registred, by such authenticall writers, it were almost incredible, that so manye and so straunge calamityes, coulde befall in so shorte a space. First the famine was so greate, that not onlye they of the same

familye, were at weapons for a bitt of meate, but the soldiers, that lyke hungrye wolues ranged about the cittye, if in anye place they felt but the sent of vittayle, they rushed in with drawne swordes, and were readye to ripp open the bellyes and bowels of their owne citizens, to fetch out the meate which they had eaten, and fedd vppon that lothsome stuffe so brutishlye gotten, & imbrued in the bloode of the first eater, as vppon a deyntye & delicate dish. The childrē were at defiance with their owne parentes, the brothers & sisters mortall enemyes, the father and mother at deadlye foode, with their owne ofspring, all readye to murder one an other, for euery bitt that anye of them putt into their mouth; So farr did the extremitye of hunger, abolishe all feelinge of naturall affection: yea & that which is more, man was enforced to chew beastes dunge, & after they had eaten vpp the fleshe to take their repast vppon their most filthye excrementes. Others fishing & raking in the sinckes & chanels, from thēce gatherd though for to thincke most detestable & bestlye,

yet to them in those termes not vnpleasant foode. Some fedd vppon the lether of their bucklers, and shoes: others on trampled and broken haye, finallye men vsed to all varietye of viande, and delicious fare, were now driuen to so base and abhominable dyett, as the brute beastes them selues by nature would abhorr. I leaue it to your consideratiō what mortallity & strange diseases this famine was likely to breed. But yet besid this, were ther at the same time such ciuil mutinies, such domesticall vprores amongest thē selues, that euen Titus theire mortall enemye, who laye in siege about their citye, hearing of their mutuall slaughters, for all his vnplacable enmitye, was deepely moued with compassion, saying that they needed no foreyne enemyes to worke theire confusion, so bloodye were the tragedyes they reysed among them selues. Neyther was this the greatest of their miseryes. For afterward besyde the vnmercifull hauocke, that the romaines made of the Iewes, when the citye was taken, there was found an other thing, that bred occasion of a greter

and most cruell massaker. For the Iewes vnwillinge to enrich their enemyes with their treasure, and thincking to saue somewhat from the generall spoyle, swallowed into their bodyes so much golde, perle, and prcious stone, as nature woulde beare. which thinge the Romanes afterwarde fyndinge out by their excrementes, they left rifeling their houses, & in most barbarous sort began to ransacke their bodyes & bowells: So that wheras they thought their bodyes, their surest coffers, they found by a rufull experience their owne follye, who when they might with theire treasure haue tedeemed theire lyues, they so horded it vp, that neyther they coulde vse it to their owne profite, nor the enemye spoyle them of it without spillinge their lyues. Finallye besydes battering downe the walles, the defacinge of the citye, the burninge of the temple; there were as Iosephus reporteth partly by famine, partly by the sword, put to death, an eleuen hundred thousand Iewes, besydes fourscore and ten thousand other the relques and onlye remnant of that nation, that were scattered

                   by an infectious wynde was two whole yeres consumed with so generall a pestilence, that all the inhabitantes were eyther dead, or by extreame leanes left in as good as deadly termes. Yea and in L. Cecilius Metellus and Q. Fabius Maximus Seuerinus tyme,
                     Iul Obsequens. Oros. li. 4 ca. 4
                   The infection and mortalltye was so greate, that first there were not enow to burye the dead, and in the end ther were none at all. In so much that great howses were voyde of liuing, and full of dead bodyes, furnished with ample patrimonyes, but without anye to enioye them: Yea the miserye grew to so lamentable an issue, that not onlye, there could no man liue in the citye, but not so much, as approch vnto it, so vntolerable was the stenche of the dead carcases, rotting in their houses,

and in theire owne beddes. Neyther was that wonderfull punishmēt of god, shewed in M. Plautius Hipsaeas and M. Flaccus dayes, of lesse terror. For when throughe out all Africa, there swarmed innumerable multitudes of Locustes, which deuoured, not onlye the corne, fruites, herbes, leaues, and twigges; but euen the barke of trees, and drye wood being lifted al frō the earth, with a sodeyne tempest, and gathered into globes, they were caried in the ayre, a long tyme, and in the end drowned in the African sea. Which afterwarde casting them by huge heapes vpon the shoares, there rotting, and putrifying, they breathed out so noysome and pernicious a sauour, that the verye bestes and byrdes dying, and corrupting in the fieldes, greatlye increased the former annoyance. And as for men in Numidia where then Micipsa raygned, ther dyed eyght hundred thousand, and about the sea costes, towarde Carthage, and Vtica two hundred thousand more and in Vtica it selfe thirtye thousande soldiers. The death also was so sodeyne that in one daye, and by one only gate

of this one citye, there were caried out fiftene hundred of the younger sorte. And thus the multitude of vermyne, that could not alyue haue bene endured, was much lesse tolerable, when it was dead, and the perishing therof destroyed all thinges, which they could haue consumed, if they had liued longer. Which most detestable infections, being conceyued, encreased, and fostered, in mens bodyes, by breathing, and drawing in the corrupted ayre, we see how seuere a whipp, of Gods iustice it hath bene, and that of Gods great mercye it proceedeth, that we liuing therin so long, haue ben thereby spared, from parte of lyke rigorous punishemente, our sinnes, being so greuous that they deserued, not onlye this our present, and in comparison verye smale aduersitye; but the moste bitter portion of the forenamed vengeance. Now if we consider, what desolate effectes the fyer hath wrought, not onlye in hell and purgatorye, where the torment therof is vnspeakeable, but in this verye lyfe we shall fynde them, no lesse fearefull argumentes, of Gods iustice, then haue

This scourge hath the citye Catana, and the adioyning places felte so greeuouslye, & that more then once that all the houses therof being couered and oppressed with heapes of burning ashes, the Romans were contented to release them tenne yeares tribute, to repaire the vnestimable damages of one such eruption. But of all other, that was most notorious, which Iulius Obsequens and Orosius write of the Iland Lippara,

the fishes turning vpp their bellyes, sodden in the same waters & seas, wherein they were bredd. The men also that could not flye verye farr from that place, styfled, and their bowelles burnt within them, so miraculouslye was the ayre inflamed. And to passe from heate to colde, we read that fower thousand soldiers, who at the siege of Asculum fledd from Pompeius, were vppon the topp of a mountayne frozen so styffe, that standing ther in the snow with theire eyes open, and their teeth bare, no man could otherwise perceiue they were dead, but onlye by want of motion. It were to long to reherse the inuasions of wylde beastes, though as Diodorus writeth,

When two guiltye wretches are conuented before the same iudge, for crymes of lyk tenour, and qualitye, if the one be condemned to endure the extremity of the lawe, hath not the other greate cause to tremble and quake, yea and vndoubtedlye to looke for the same entreaty. But now if contrarye to his desertes, the iudge mitigate his sentence, & in liew of a rigorous chastismente appoynte some farr mor easye, then that which to his felow was allotted: Hath not he rather greate cause, to be gratefull to the iudge, for the benefite of his deliuerye, then anye waye to murmur or repyne at his verdict. How then can we hauing so manye examples of condemned persons, for the lyke sinnes whereof we are also guilty, but highlie prayse the mildnesse of our heauenlye iudge, that hauing so hardlye vsed others, he hath mercifullye spared vs, and relented the heauye hand of his iustice, to laye so easye a burthen vppon vs. Yea when we ether looke vpp to heauen, or

downe to earth, or on the ayre, fyer, or water about vs, remembring howe terrible they haue ben agaynst others, how can we but muse how they haue ben with-helde from wreaking vppon vs the lyke indignation.

                         of hell.
                   But to passe from preambles to the thinge in deede, from shadowes to the truthe, from gentle warninges to the penaltye it selfe: I will leaue the reuenge of sinne shewed in this lyfe, and come to that which is prepared in the next, in respect wherof al the formētioned miseries, are but very small resemblances, and forerunninge signes. This we maye gather of Christs owne wordes, who reckening all these calamityes, saying Natiō shall ryse agaynst nation and kingdome agaynst kingdome and ther shalbe great earthquakes in places,

haec, These are but a beginninge of the griefes, as who would saye, these wonders, and straunge euentes, are but pronostications of thinges to come, as a smoake in respect of a terrible ensuinge fyer, and lyke a musteringe of soldiers before the sadde battayle. What therefore will the paynes be, that these beginninges portend, and how rigorous a sentence, that hath so fearefull remonstrances before the iudgement. But lest I be to tedious, I will not stand to make a full declaration of the tormentes of the next world, but onlye briefly touch so much thereof, as maye be enough for vs to ghesse at the rest. And first not onlye these aforesayde afflictions, or at the lest the terrour and payne therof, but all other paynfull and vnpleasant thinges, that are in this worlde scattered, and dispersed in diuers places, and creatures, shalbe there vnited and ioyned to the reuenge of sinne. And that in such sorte, that whereas here diuers of them, are sufficient alone to worke our temporall death, and he that hath indured one, is past feare of susteyning anye other; there euery sinner shall susteyne

them all, in farr more cruell maner, then any of them can here punishe, and besydes them also infinite other panges proper and peculier to hell. So that whatsoeuer there is in the whole worlde, or euer hath ben or shalbe, that can payne sighte, hearing, sent, taste, or feeling, what disease or vexation so euer, can here torment the hart, the hed, ioints, bones, sinews, veins, or any parcel or mēber of our bodye, whatsoeuer can most or lest trouble or annoye our will, memory, or vnderstāding or any poure of our mynde: all these and a thousand tymes more, shall ioyntlye at one instant, and that foreuer, most vnmercifully torment eche sinner in euery part of bodye and soule. And to descende to some particulers. First if we consider the place the verye names therof maye giue vs to vnderstande how miserable a thing it is to be thrust into it. It is called a bottomlesse depth,

Nether shall the comfortes of the companye, anye whitt relieue the discomforte of the place. For first they shall haue the Deuill and his Angels in most horrible & frightful shapes,

in the houses, and the Sirens in the temples of their pleasure. O vnhappye place and more vnhappye companye, what tormentes in this lyfe come neere to any of these miseries, and yet how often alas haue we deserued them both, and a great deale more. But peraduenture there is ether some pleasant sight, some comfortable talke, or musicke, some sweet odores, or delitious iuncates, or other pleasurs of the body, that abate the horrour of the place & companye. Alas and what are theire sightes, but the deuills in hideous and monstrous formes, theire moste fearefull and threatninge shapes, their barbarous & spritishe crueltye, their vnmercifull rending, worowing, slaughtering, scourging, and torturing. The tormentes of others, and espeaciallye their fellowes in sinne, aboue them an vnplacable iudge, vnderneath them an vnquencheable fyer, about them vnfatigable tormenters, on eche syde desperate and miserable companye, euerye where vneuitable & endlesse tormentes.

The fyer of hell hath light to damnation, that the wicked maye see wherof to be sorye, but it hath no lyght to their consolation, that they maye see wherof to besolaced. There shalbe confusion of moste frightfull noyses, for their musicke there shalbe the horrible terrour of thunder, wyndes, stormes, and tempestes, the raging of the seas, the horrible roaring of the deuils, the sparkling of the flames, the cursinge and blasphemies of the wicked, the weeping and gnashinge of teeth, continuall skriching, howling, sighing, and sobbinge, continuall hissing, barking, gurminge, and bellowinge, with all other odious & fearfull noyses. woe, vae and Alas, shall euerlastingly fill their eares, and this shalbe their harmonye, to recompēce the disordered abuse, of their hearing in this lyfe. Nether shall their sent be free frō most noysome sauours. For besydes the stench of the fyer and brimstone, besydes all the filthe & corruption of this worlde, that in the later daye shall (as some holde) be voyded into hell, as the chanell and sincke of

all vncleanesse: The verye bodyes of the damned shalbe more vnsauery then any carryne, or dead carcas, and being ther so pestered & crammed together, that they shall lye scralling vppon one an other like heaps of froggs or toades mingled with serpents, Basaliskes and other most vglye and vncleane wormes, and vermyne. We maye easelye ghesse what their torment shalbe in that behalfe. Now for their taste, what comfort can it yelde when the rehearsed annoyances be, yea what discomfort shall it adioyne, to the former miseryes. And of this is sett in Iob.

                  His bredd in his bellye shalbe turned into the gall of cocatrices, he shall vomitt out the riches which he hath deuoured, and God shall pull them out of his bellye, he shall sucke the head of a cocatrice, and the tongue of the viper shall kill him. Their mouth shall continually be stuffed, and farsed full of abhominable poyson, and filth most bitter, sower, salte, and lothsome. Their lippes, roofe, tongue, and gummes perpetuallye tormented with gnawinge venemous wormes, whose taste shalbe as paynfull as their tearing. Finallye their whole bodye now free,

sing in snow, now broyling in fyer, man gled by wormes and tearinge fiendes, whipped and harried by the deuill, and perpetually tumbled in fyer and brimstone, amiddest that masse of carcases and monsters, what an vnrestye bedd and vntollerable torment shall it feele in euerye parte. And loe if we remember, this verye bodye of oures, that we now beare about vs, and whose present misery we so much lamēt & thinke so greuous, deserued to haue ben in all these vnspeakeable paynes, since the time we committed the first mortall sinne, in all our lyfe, vntill this instant and foreuermore. Yea and in much more miserable tormentes of mynde. For our imagination should haue ben in continuall frightes, and feares of the present terrours, and paynes, The vnderstanding vexed with a desperate, and obstinate conceyte, of Gods vnplacable iustice, of the eternitye of these paynes, and of the losse of euerlasting felicitye. The memorye also pestered, with remē
                  brance of the ioyes past, and sorowes present, comparing euerye senses pleasure, with the incumbent payne, and

the opportunity that was once offered to avoyde those punishmētes, of whose releasing there nether now is, nor euer wilbe anye sparke of hope. For as S. Gregorye sayeth,

                   the damned suffer an end without end, a death without death, a decay without decay, because ther death euer liueth, their end alwayes beginneth, and their decaye neuer ceaseth. But they are alwayes healed to be new wounded, alwayes repayred to be new deuoured. They are euer dyinge and neuer dead, a perpetuall praye neuer consumed, eternallye broyling and neuer burnt vpp. Now therfore if there be anye man so innocent, that he may saye Nihil mihi conscius sum, mundum est cor meum.

selfe as well worthy of their troubles, as ether of them, how much more being one from his childhoode, fleshed & noseled in sinn, as most of vs be, hath he rather cause to maruaile why he is not in hel, thē why he is in prison, why he is not rather condēned to the eternall losse of heauenly treasure, then to the temporal losse of a few worldly goods, finally why he is not adiudged to a death, that is an vnhappye beginning, to a more vnhappye progresse, and no ending, then to a death, that ending all miserye, beginneth an endlesse felicitye.

                   for a motiue to comfort you in your tribulation, what more forcible thing can I sett before your eyes, thē the cause of your persecution, the honour of your present estate, and the future rewarde of your patiente and constant sufferance. First the cause which you defend, is the onlye true and Catholike religion, that which impugneth you, is erroneous, and blasphemous heresye. Our weapons in this action, are prayer, fasting,

exhortation and good example. We defende that Church, which is by all antiquitye auouched, by the blood of infinite Martirs confirmed, by the heretikes of all ages gaynsayed, and by all testimonyes most vndoubtedlye approued. We defende that Church of Rome,

In olde Rome hath the true fayth euen from the times of our forefathers, ben kept, and it alwayes retayneth it, as it is fitt for a cittye, that ruleth the whole worlde, to haue euermore a sound fayth of God.

                   no Hereticke dareth for shame clayme as proper to his owne secte, hauing of all ages and persons, ben euermore accounted

the knowen style of men of our profession. We defend a Churche founded by Christ, enlarged by his Apostles, impugned by none but infidels and condemned heretikes. Whose doctrine can be deriued from no late author, neuer conuinced of noueltye, neuer touched with variablenesse, change, or contrarietye in essentiall poyntes of beliefe. This Illiricus our professed enemye,
                     Iliricus
                   hath in his centurias sufficientlye shewed, where from age to age he setteth downe the sayinges of the fathers that manifestly approue our fayth, how beit malicously he termeth them, naeuos Patrum the wennes or wertes of the fathers. And yett for his owne doctrine, he can not fynde in all antiquitye so manye sound and vnblemished places, as the werttes be which he findeth for the cōfirmation of oures. And therfore well sayth Vincentius Lirinensis, that our religion imitateth the course of our bodyes. For though there be greate difference betweene the flower of childhoode & the ripenesse of olde age, yet is it the same man that was then younge, and is now olde, & though the partes

of childrens bodyes, be nether so bigg nor stronge, as they be in the full groweth: yett are they the verye same, equall in number, and lyke in proportion, and if anye haue altered shape, vnagreable to the former, or be increased or diminished in nūbre, the whole body eyther waxeth monstrous, or weake, or altogether dyeth. So ought it to be in Christian doctrine, that though by yeeres the same be strengthened, by tyme enlarged, and aduaunced by age, yett alwayes it remayne vnaltered, and vncorrupted. And though the wheate cornell, which our forefathers haue sowen, by the husbandmans diligence hathe spronge to a more ample forme, hath more distinction of parts, & is become an eare of corne, yett lett the proprietye of the wheate be retayned, and no cokle reaped where the wheate was sowen. But now towching the Churche that impugneth vs, as of all other heresies, we can bringe forth the late beginner, his new doctrine, eyther vnheard of before, or condemned in other heretickes, his first adherentes, the general opposition against him, or counsels,

vniuersityes and Catholicke Doctours, varietye and sodeyne chaunge in doctrine, and diuision of his disciples, as of Luther and Caluin the worlde knoweth, and of other heretickes all historyes doe reporte.

                   And thus did Tertullian Optatus Millenitanus and S, Augustine with other fathers sett downe a note, to know them by the demaunding the beginninge of their beliefe, the cause of their longe lurkinge, the origin of their cathedrall seate. We defend that Churche which notwithstandinge the rage of the Iewes in her Infancye, the barbarous tirranye of Pagan Emperors in her Childhoode. The outragious persecutions of heretickes in her ripe age, not withstandinge all other bruntes, and encounters of Satan, and his impes, hath alwayes remayned vnpregnable, yea the more it hath bene lopped and pruned, the more hath it shott out, and florished. The more it hath bene suppressed, the better hath it prospered, and lyke the arke of Noe with the swelling of the waters, that haue drowned all other sectes, it was rather alofted and aduaunced to the view of all nations.

For as S. Leo noteth.

                   The Church is not diminished with persecutions, but encreased, and our Lordes fielde is then alwayes best furnished with most abundance of corne, when the cornells that are single in their sowing, are multiplyed in theire grouthe. Which surelye could neuer be, vnlesse it were of God miraculously maynteined. For as Gamaliel sayed.
                     Act: 5
                   If it were the counsell or worke of men, it would haue bene dissolued, but because it is the Church of God the gates of hell haue not bene able to preuayle agaynst it,
                  
                     Matt: 16
                   beinge the firmament and piller of truthe as S. Paule calleth it.
                     1 Tim: 3
                   
                  S. Chrisostome also vpon the forerehersed wordes of S. Mathew, sayeth, that God onlye was able to make, that a church founded vppon one fisher, & a base person, shoulde not fall beinge shaken with so boystrous tempestes. For though the Catholickes haue bene temporallye so weake, their number in respect of their enemyes small, The princes that haue impugned them most mightye, theire decrees, manacinges, and tormentes, to suppresse them vntollerable, yet because they were built vpon a sure rocke

not all this blusteringe of wyndes, nor irruption of waters, haue had power to ouer flowe or to beare them down, but that in the ende, they haue had and alwayes shall haue the vpper hande of Gods enemies. Nether can any say, that it is not our Church, but theirs that was thus persecuted. For there is no tirānical persecution, but hath alwayes bene most violentlye bent, agaynst the sea of Rome, and agaynst the Pope and his followers, in so much that of the Popes them selues, there haue bene aboue thirtye Martirs. Besydes if we reede all antiquitye, we shall not fynde one, that hath suffered for anye parte of our aduersaryes religion, but onlye such, as are by all auncient authors registred for damnable heretickes. whereas we can alledge them diuers that hane died and ben persecuted for poyntes of our beliefe, who haue euer bene since their deathes honoured, and acknowleged for Saintes, by all Christendome, vntill Luthers tyme. For how manye virgins for not breakinge theire vowe of virginitye, haue bene cruellye put to death which if they would haue consented to

mariage might haue easelye escaped as S. Agnes so highlye praysed by S. Ambrose and diuerse others.
                     Amb. ser. 90.
                   How many for cleauing vnto the Pope & fayth of Rome, haue bene by the Arrian Emperours, banished and put to death. Did not S. Alban dye for receiuing a Clergye man, and S. Thomas of Canterburye for defendinge the libertye of the Churche agaynst vsurped authoritye. Were not diuerse put to death in Coproninus tyme for defendinge Images, finallye how manye monckes, heremites, and religious men, whom our aduersaryes disclayme from their religion, how many I saye haue ben martired for their faith as Palladius and S. Damascen write.

                   Nether doe I recken these in perticuler to exclude all the other Martirs, for dout lesse as by their historyes is apparent, in all persecutions none died Martirs, but of our fayth. But I cite these perticulers to shew that those generally in former ages haue ben accoūted as Martirs, that haue suffered for these selfe same poyntes, for the which we are now chieflye persecuted. So that it sufficiently appeareth, that both all the generall persecutions

haue ben raysed agaynst our churche, and that not withstanding all their crueltye it yett endureth, and shall to the worldes end. But now on the other syde, two hundred archheretickes, brochers of new sectes, that haue ben since Christes tyme, though they haue for a season florished, and preueyled, hauinge Emperours, Bishopes, and Potentates, to defende them, infinite bookes and writings to diuulge their doctrine, and all temporall aydes to sett them forwarde: Yet we see that their memory is quite abolished, their names cōmonlye vnknowen, theire bookes perished, and no more mention of them thē the condemnation and disproofe of their errours recorded by Catholicke writers. The same doubtlesse wilbe the end of Luthers noueltyes, which being but parcels of their corruptions, reuiued and raked out of obliuion, as heretofore they vanished with their prime deuisers, so will they now with their late reuiuers. And we see this almost euen alreadye verified, seeing that amonge so manye of Luthers progenye, ther are founde scarce anye, and peraduenture

none at all, that dare aduouche or take vppon him the patronage of all his articles: Yea and his schollers are alredy so straungelye sondred into most contrarious and diuers sectes, that it is a most manifest token, and proofe, that God is not the author of theire opinions, seing he is only the God of peace, and not of dissentiō.

                   For Lindanus long since, in his Dialogue named Dubitantius, reckeneth vpp threescore & eyghtene diuerse sectes, sprong all since Luthers first preachinge, and with those that are of later grouth, they are now well nere a hundred all different from others, in essentiall poyntes of faythe, as in moste of them Prateolus sheweth. Which doubtlesse is the prouidence of almightye God, in this as it hath bene in all other heresies, of former dayes, that the vnconstancye, varietye, and sodeyne chaunge, the dissention of doctrine and diuision of schollers, both from theire maisters and among them selues, should be a manifest argument, that their assertions proceeded of the spirite of error, were maynteyned with the spiritt of pryde and obstinacye, and

should be quicklye ended by the spiritt of discord & contradiction. This doth Ireneus obserue of Simon Magus,

Austine speaketh in minutissima frusta into very small māmocks. For why, when they once swarue from the compasse of the Catholicke Churches censure, onlye allowing and interpreting the scripture in the sense, that their single spiritt susgesteth, as they be of diuerse fancyes and humours, so fall they into diuerse and sondrye perswasions, and then not yeldinge to anye vmpiershipp but their owne, they are past all meanes and possibillity of agrement.

opinions and contradictons of heretickes, and by conferring them together deduce therby a conclusiō against them, which maye serue as fyer to burne vpp their owne frutes. And in deed there is nothing of more force, to shew their madnesse, thē this presumptiō vpon their selfe arbitrement, which is the cause of all their discord. For as S. Chrisostome noteth.

                   As we would iudge one madd, that seinge the smithe take a red hott iron with his tongues, would aduenture to take the same in his bare fingers, so maye we deeme both of the Philosophers, that went about to compasse our faith in their bare reason, & of the heretickes of our tyme, that aduenture vppon the creditt of their single spirits, to decyde all controuersies, and interprete Gods worde, which the cunningest smithes of all antiquitye, durst neuer handle but by the tongues of the Catholike Churches censure. And therfore as one takinge the Kinges image sett forth with exquisite, conning, and with most choyce precious stones, by a rare workman, should change it from mans shape, and the seemelye fashion

                   setting the light of the scripture and counterfaite pietye, vppon the rockes of heresyes, allure the simple passengers of this lyfe, to their owne perdition vnder colour

of truth. And therfore are we warned, not to beleue euerye spiritt, whereuppon Catholickes the better to auoyde this variance, presumption, and malicious fraud of heretickes, alwayes standing to the verdict of the Church, and her chiefe Pastour, to whom God hath promised the vnfallible assistance of his spirite, haue euermore defended with one accorde, one onlye fayth, agreable to it selfe in all tymes, places, and persons, which is the selfe same, which we now suffer persecutiō for. Wherof we cal all auncient writers to witnesse, who by their bookes & many by their bloode, haue before vs laboured in the same quarell & confirmed the same faith, though assaulted by other kynde of enemyes. But if comparison with sayntes be not presumption, this for our greater comforte maye we saye, that thoughe the cause of religion were alwayes honorable, yett is it in vs more worthelye defended, then of anye Martirs of former ages. For they defēded it ether agaynst Epicures and heathens or agaynst the Iewes and Rabbines, or agaynst some one heretike and his ofspringe. But we are

now in a battayle, not onlye agaynst men o four tymes, who are both Epicures in conditions, Iewes in malice, and Heretickes in proud and obstinate spirittes: But agaynst the whole rable and generatiō of all heretiks, that since Christes tyme haue ben, & in a māner with Satan the father of lying, and his whole armye. who albeit they be fast cheyned in hell, & there reape the fruite of their blasphemyes. yett haue these companions of theires borowed all their weapons, and reuiued some of all their heresies. So that encountring with these, we chalenge all the olde heretickes into the fielde, and must in one age susteyne a multitude of enemies, ioyntlye assaulting vs, euerye one of the which, haue in times past made worke enough for diuerse Doctours, in seuerall ages accordinge as they did ryse one after an other. For we must defend that God is not author of sinne agaynst.

                  Epiphanius, Ireneus, Tertullian and al antiquitye registred in the Catalogue of condemned heretikes. Finally we mnst defend in a manner all Catholicke truthes, agaynst all hereticall innouations. I am ashamed to say, that we are forced to defend that Christ is come agaynst the Iewes, that he is of the same snbstance with his father, and Homoousios agaynst the Arrians, yea and that there is anye Christ or God at all, agaynst the Politiques and Atheistes. Yet vndoubtedlye if euer there were anye neede, euen when Epicurus sect moste florished to proue a God, a hell, or a heauen, then surely is there now, when

heresye is growne so ripe, and the infinite sectes and diuisions so spread, besyde new daylye vprisinge, that the varietye of religions, hath abolished almost all religion, and the vncertaintye which emongest so many is truest, hath made the greatest parte of our contrey to beleeue none at all. Yea and we see the liues, consciences, and dispositions of men in this behalfe to be at suche a staye, that should the Prince but commaunde them, to adore Mahomett or renewe the memorye of the olde Godds, and Goddesses, as Iupiter, Iuno, Venus, with the rest of that crew, there would be thousandes, as readye to embrace them, and seeme as zealous in their seruice as now they be in a belief of they can not tell what them selues. And this in truthe is the ende, and last stepp that heresie bringeth men vnto. Seinge therfore that Peters shipp now sayleth, not agaynst the wynde of one euill spirite, or agaynst the streame of one fludde of heresye, but agaynst all the pestilent spirittes, of former ages, and agaynst the maigne streame of all heresye: It is no lesse necessarye then

glorious, for vs to employe our last endeuours to the defence thereof. And thincke our limmes happelye lost, our bloode blessedlye bestowed, our lyues most honorablye spent in this so noble and in important a businesse. And how beit it maye seeme much, for men of one age to fighte with the enemyes of so many. for Catholikes of one beliefe, to encounter with hoastes and armyes of all sundrye sectes: yett this comfort we haue to encourage vs, that first as some medicines there be of such qualitye, that they are not onlye profitable for this or that disease, but haue a generall and common force aganst all, so sayeth Hillarius,
                  
                     Hilar: l: 2. de Trinit.
                   the Catholicke fayth not onlye agaynst euerye heresye, but agaynst them all hath so vniuersall a remedye, that nether the straunge kynde of the disease can hinder it, nor the nū
                  ber ouercome it, nor the varietye deceyue it, but one electuarye serueth it agaynst all hereticall pestilences, which is the vnfallible assistance of Gods spiritt. Secondlye we fight agaynst suche as deriue their petegree from the offalles, and condēned castawayes of Gods

Chuche, whose weapons and wardes hauinge bene seuerallye blunted, and broken, by the Champions of former tymes, they are lesse able to offend vs, or defend theire vnhappye posteritye. Whereas on the other syde, we are coū
                  tergarded with the assistance of so vnuī
                  cible aydes, that as hitherto they could neuer be discomfited, so is ther no possibillitye that they should be hereafter. And firste what an assured defence of our cause haue we, by that continuall, and neuer interrupted descent, and succession of Bishopps in the sea of Rome, of whom from S. Peters tyme vntill this daye, we are able from tyme to tyme to giue a certayne accounte, & to shew of euery one the same beliefe, that they haue from hand to hand deliuered vnto vs, without chaunge or alteration: as agaynst the impious obliquies of heretiques of our tyme, Bellarminus learnedlye sheweth in the fourth booke of of his first Tome, and third controuersye. This sayeth Ireneus confoundeth all heretickes,

                   oppose against sectaries for an vncōquerable engine, as in deede it is. Especiallye if we consider, that after the decaye of al other Patriarchal, and Apostolicall Seates, as of Antioch, Alexandria, and Hierusalem, after so manye alterations, and violent changes of the temporall state of Rom
                        •
                     , from Emperoures to Kinges of the Gothes, from them to exarkes of the Greekes, and an otherwhyle to Consuls, and of these some by right, some rayninge by vsurped authoritye, likewyse after so manye Massakers, sackinges, and ouerthrowes of the citye it selfe: yet this succession hath neuer fayled the authority therof neuer decayed, but hath alwayes continued & perseuered as it shall doe to the ende of the worlde. Secondlye, what an assured proofe of our religion agaynst all the aduersaryes Cauils, hath the Church of Rome, by the īnumerable miracles wherby God hath auerred the

truth thereof, in diuerse famous and holye men, adherentes and defendours of the same. For albeit the deuill maye worke some fayned wonders, aboue mans reache, & yet in the cōpasse of other naturall causes, thoughe also by inueigling and deceyuing our sense, or imagination, he maye make that appeare a miracle which in deed is none, yett these thinges which surpasse the habilitye of anye creature, and are onlye in the power of almightye God, nether the deuill nor anye other, can doe by naturall meanes, but onlye as the instrument and agent of God, chiefest and soueraigne cause therof: as to giue sighte to the blynde, to restore a līme to the maymed, to rayse the deade and such lyke, which men of our beliefe in all ages since Christe haue donne. For to omitt Christ and his Apostles, to omitt also others of the primitiue Churche, we fynde such as our aduersaryes can not denye, to haue bene of our Church, to haue wrought verye extraordinarye miracles. First those of Gregorye Thaumaturge,

                     Bern. in vita Malachia.
                   Let S. Malachias so highly cōmended in S. Bernardes works,

Lett S. Bernardes owne lyfe written by Gotfrye a man of the same tyme, lett S. Francis miracles registred by S. Bonauenture, S. Dominickes S. Thomas of Aquine Saint Bonauentures owne be testimonies whose fayth is the trewest, seinge that all these were them selues monckes and fryers, and first founders of diuers religious orders, professours of perpetuall pouertye, chastitye and obedience, and vowed persons. All which poyntes are condemned by our aduersaryes, and maynteyned by vs. Finally to come to sayntes yett freshe in memorye, what miraculous thinges haue ben wrought by S. Bernardin & S. Catherine of Siena, of whome Sainte Anthonine writeth, by S. Anthonine him 
                     •
                  elfe of whome Surius writeth. And in our dayes since Luther vprist, by the reuerend father Francis Xauier of the societye of Iesus, in the Indies whose wonderfull miracles are not onlye certeyne by most diligent enquirye, and scrutinie made for the true knowledge of them by the Kinge of Portugall, but the miraculous conuersion of so manye thousandes, yea and so manye Kingdomes, as by the same

were turned from infidelitye to the Romaine faith, yeldeth an vndoubted assurance therof. Seynge therfore that these men by our aduersaries owne confessiō, and by their lyues and writinges, are manifestlye knowne for men of our religion; Seynge also their miracles were suche, as surmounted all power of coniuringe, sorcery, or enchantment, as the fathers graunt the giuinge light to the blynde limmes to those that wante them, and reuiuinge the dead to be. Seynge finallye these miracles haue ben wrought, eyther for testimony of their vertue, which can not be true vertue without true faythe, or for proofe of their religion, which all authors assure vs was the same that oures, what greater certificat can we haue of the goodnesse and integrity of our quarell, since we are sure that God the onlye author of these supernaturall effectes, can not witnesse anye kynde of vntruthe. And to doubte whether these miracles be true, or truelye reported, being written by so graue and authenticall auctors is nothinge els, but to condemne all historyes, bookes, and registers of antiquitye,

and onlye to allow that whereof our owne sight and sense doth acerteine vs, which is extreme follye. Moreouer if we consider both the sinceritye and sanctitye of our fayth, and the professours therof, and the absurditye and corruption of our aduersaryes beliefe, and behauiour; by the fruites we shall soone know in whose gardeyne the best tree groweth. For as concerninge our fayth, the principles, rules, & groundes therof are suche, that though they be aboue, yett are they not agaynst reason, neither yelde they scope to suche as lyue accordinge to their prescript, of licentiousnesse or riott, but keepe them in awe and compasse of their duety towardes God and man. Whereas the verye articles of our aduersaries religion, are of suche tenour, that in reason and pietye, they can not be held for religious truthes, nor beinge belieued restrayne mens consciences to the limites of vertue, but rather open them a wyde gate to desperat & dissolute lyfe. For he that affirmeth all the actions of man, euen the verye beste to be damnable sinnes, as Caluin and his followers auouche,

and therewith that all sinnes are of equall deformitye and heynousnes, touchinge death and damnation, what harte or encouragement can he haue, to followe vertue, or what bridle can holde him from plunginge him selfe in the puddle of all vyce: seinge the one is as greate an offence, and as punishable before God as the other, and the same fayth which maketh, that the sinfulnesse of a good action is not imputed to the doer, is also of the same force and hath the same effecte, in anye other wicked worke whatsoeuer. Agayne he that beleeueth the cōmaundements of God to be impossible for man to keepe, and withall that howsoeuer he breake them, it nether can nor ought to make him doubt of his election, which dependeth only vpon gods predestinatiō, why should he not thincke it follye to endeuoure to obserue Gods lawe beinge an impossibillitye: yea and vppon certaintye of his saluation, become carelesse to breake anye commandemement, & to take what course most pleaseth his sensuall appetyte. Further he that maketh God the author of sinne, & as well the inforcer of man to wicked and impious

actes, as the directour to anye vertue. and withall knoweth that if he be damned it shalbe for no other sinne then suche as by God him selfe he was constrayned to committ, must needes thinke his case most miserable in being so dishabled, from auoydinge suche an offence, and God a most rigorous and vniust iudge, that condemneth a man for that fault, which he forced him vnto. The effecte of which and such lyke principles, well appeareth in the vnchristian and irreligious behauiour of sondrye estates, and speaciallye of the protestant ministers, teachers, and defenders of the same, who are knowen in most places to be so loose, and lewde, & so far disordred, that their own shepe do greatly mislike their vngodly behauior. But now on the other syde for proofe of the sincerity of our religion, I only appeale to the common experience of Catholickes lyues, both in our and former ages. Let all historyes witnesse their sincere dealing, playne wordes, simple attire, frugal tables, vnfained promises, assured loue, & amity, and most intier & friendlye conuersation one with an other.

Lett vs consider their large hospitallity, in houskeeping: their liberallity towardes the poore, their redinesse to al mercifull and charitable actes. Lett vs remember their assiduitye, and continuall exercyse of prayer, theire strayte obseruation of long fastes, their austeritye and rigour, in other chastisments of their bodyes, & we shall fynde what different manners, and fruites proceed from our beliefe, & from the doctrine of our new doctours. Yea and the chiefest thinges layde to our charge, by infidels, and heretickes, are that we kepe men to much in awe, that we restrayne them to muche from carnall libertye, that we haue to muche of the crosse of Christ. Iudeis quidem scandalum, Gentibus autem stultitiam.
                  
                     1 Cor. 1
                   Scandall to the Iewes, and follye to the Gentils. So doth Plinius reporte of vs in his epistles to Traian that we detest all vices,
                     Plin. 2. l. 10. Ep.
                   and lyue most holylye, and that we haue onlye twoe faultes. The one is, that we are to readye to spend our lyues in Gods cause, the other, that we ryse to earlye before daye to syng prayses vnto Christ. which faultes our Gospellers of all other take

most heede of. So for the moste parte exceptinge those lyes, that the Heretickes father vppon vs, the greatest complayntes they haue agaynst vs, are for prescribing fastes, forbidding fleshe on certayne dayes, condemninge mariage of Priestes, Monckes, and other vowed persons. For prescribinge confession, satisfaction, and penance in this lyfe for men sinnes. For auouchinge prayer, fastinge, almois, and other good workes as necessarye to saluation. For requiringe an exacte obedience, of the temporall to the spirituall, and of all to Christes Vicar here in earth. For condemninge the arrogancye, of their selfe spirites, refusinge all other iudgement in matters of controuersye, and intelligence of the scripture besydes theire owne, and suche lyke poyntes that may anye waye brydle them, from full libertye of followinge their carnall appetites. Yett for all they thus disalow our doctrine, the truthe it selfe enforceth them somtymes, as of olde it did the verye deuils, to speake most reuerently of our religion, and professours therof. Luther in his booke agaynst the Anabaptists,
                  
cōfesseth that in the Popdome ther is most of christiā goodnes, ye al christiā goodnes, & that frō thēce he & his receiued it. And rehersing that we haue the true scriptures, Baptisme, Sacramēt of the Altar, the true keyes of iurisdiction, the true office of preachinge, the true Cathechisme, our Lordes prayer, the ten commandementes, and the articles of faythe. In the end he concludeth with these wordes. I auouche moreouer (sayeth he) that in the Popdome there is true Christianitye, yea the verye cornell of Christianitye, so that this cornell beinge but one, according to that Vna fides Vnum baptisma, ther is but one fayth and one baptisme, ether he must be of our religion or els by his owne confession, we hauinge the true cornell, he hath nothing but the huske and shell for him and his disciples. Now concerninge the professours of our faythe, S. Athanasius, S. Hierom and Sulpitius write that the infidels them selues, bare verye greate reuerence, and did muche honour, to S. Anthonye, S. Hillarion, and S. Martin. Totila an Arrian Prince honoured highly S. Benedict. Caluin called

saint Bernarde a godlye writer. Luther Melancton, and the Augustan confession call Bernard Dominicke and Francis Saintes. All which being as is before sayed Monckes, Fryers, & religious persons, are vndoubtedlye knowne to haue ben farr from the Protestantes or Puritanes religion. And though the Heretickes sayed nothinge, yett doth all antiquity crye, and infinite miracles yelde certayne warrant, of the holinesse and vertue of the Catholyke fathers. But we neede not to range farr for examples of good lyfe. For God be thancked, euen our aduersaryes them selues, are so fullye perswaded of our good behauiour, that if a man in companye be modest and graue in countenance, wordes or demeanor, if he vse no swearing, foule or vnseemelye speache, if he refuse to ioyne in lewde companye, and dishonest actions, he is strayte suspected for a Papist: And on the other syde if there be anye ruffianlye, quarellous, foule spoaken, and lewdlye conditioned, he is neuer mistrusted for a Papist, but takē for a very sound & vndoubted Protestant. Lett also the recordes of ssises,

and sessions be serched, and lett it be but shewed among so manye hundred Protestantes, as are yearelye executed, for fellonyes, murders, rapes, extortions, forgeryes, and suche lyke crymes, how few recusantes, haue bene euer in so manye yeares, attached iustlye with suche lyke offences. Lett but the neyghbours of Catholicke and Protestant gentlemen, be witnesses who
                     •
                   liue best, and are readyest to all good deedes and workes of charitye. Let the Iaylours and keepers of prisons report, what difference they fynde, in the lyues of Catholicke & Protestant prisoners. And if all these say as the truthe is, that we goe beyonde the other in Christian dutye, then maye we by theire owne testimonyes, auouche the tree of our religion to be good, seing that as Christ sayeth an euill tree can not bringe forth good fruite.
                  
                     Matt. 7
                   Whereby we maye also inferre that the religion of our aduersaryes is euill, syth the fruites therof are so extreme badd, as daylye experience sheweth, that euen among heathens and infidels there is found more truth, honestye, and conscience, then is now in

the Protestant multitude, so well haue they profited in the licentious principles of their religion. Agaynst whome we must remember that the Apostles were not without cause called salte of the earth, and lyght of the worlde, but for that their doctrine shold haue effectes agreeable to the propertyes of these thinges. For as the salt preserueth flesh from the vermyn, stenche, and corruption, & the light is a meane to discerne the good from the badd, the mierye from the cleane waye, our friend from our foe: So doth the true faythe geue remedyes, agaynst all stench and corruption of vice, and sheweth the path of vertue and trueth, from the dirtye waye of sinne and erroure.
            
            
               Cap. 7.Cap. 7 The seuenth comfort in tribulatiō is that the state of the persecuted in a good cause is honorable.
               
               Now as concerning your estate, how can that be but honorable, where your quarell is so good: seing the cause honoreth the combate, and assureth you of the finall victorye. Your counterpeeres are mightye, their force very greate, their vantage not vnknowne, their malice experienced, theire tormentes to fleshe and bloode vntollerable:

but your Captayne hath alwayes conquered, your cause hath ben always in the end aduanced, your Predecessors neuer loste the fielde, wherfore then sholde you haue lesse hope of the victorye. Christianitie is a warfare, and Christians spiritual Soldiers, their conflictes continuall, though their enemies be diuers. In the beginninge our faythe was planted in the Pouertye, Infamye, Persecution, and Death of Christe. In the Progresse, it was watered, and dunghed, with the blood and slaughtered limmes of Gods Saincts. And it cannot come to the ful grouthe, vnlesse it be fostered with the continuall showres of Martirs woundes. You are the choise captaines, whom God hath alotted to be chiefe actours in the conquest. Your veynes are conduittes, out of which he meaneth to driue the streames, that shal water his Church: he hath placed you as the fayrest and surest stones, in the forefront of his building, to delighte his friendes, and confound his enemies, with the beautie and grace of your vertuous lyfe and patient constancie. Now is the tyme come, for the lighte of the world

to blaze out beames of innocencie: for the salt of the earth to season the weake soules, bending to corruption. Yea and for the good shepheard to spende his life, for the defence of his selye flocke. Tempus putationis aduenit.

                  Cum autem videritis haec omnia fieri scitote quoniam in proximo est regnum dei. Loe the thinges that were sayd, are now done and now sith that it is fulfilled that was fore tolde, that which was promised wilbe also performed: Our Lord him-selfe assuring it and saying, when you see all these thinges to come to passe, then knowe you, that the Kingdome

of heauen is neere at hande. When we see the flower we hope for the fruite, and take it as a presage of a calme temperate, and pleasant season. Our floures that foreshew the happye calme of our felicitye, growe out of these thornes, and of these bryars must we reape our fruite. If the stalke woūd, the flower healeth, if the reapinge be troublesōe, the fruite is the more delight some. Lett no man denye the sea to be deepe sayeth S. Ambrose, because the shores be shallowe, nor heauen to be cleere, because it is sometymes cloudy, nor the earth to be fertill, because it is some where vnfruitefull, nor the cropp of corne to be good, because it is mixed with barren otes: So thinke not the haruest of a good conscience to be lost, though it be interrupted with some sorowfull and bitter shoures. The ignorant peraduenture will condemne vs, that thincke it no follye, to make account of the gall of Tobias fishe. Lett thē muse at our madnesse that most willing lye feede on Sampsons honicombe, when it is taken out of the Lyons mouth. Lett vs not regarde their phreneticall laughtures,

We know that the floure of Iesse gaue his most pleasante sent, and came to his full grouth vpon the Crosse, we knowe that the fruite of lyfe was not gathered without thornes, we knowe finallye that gall was chosen in extremitye by the most experienced and perfitt taster, and the honicombe not eaten till after his resurrection, whē it was in a manner fetched out of the Lions mouth whome he had by his death victoriouslye foyled. Our choyse agreeth with our Captaynes examples, and both the tyme, and our cause moueth vs therunto. If two keyes were offred vs, the one of golde sett with diamāts, rubies, & perle curiously wrought & hanged in a cheyne of greate price, the other of olde rustye iron, vnhandsome and shapelesse to beholde, tyed in a rotten corde, and yett this the true keye to infinite treasure, the other to a sincke of corruption, and a dungeon of dispayre, whiche of these two keyes, were in reason to be desired. This rusty

key is trouble and affliction, the key of golde worldlye prosperity: That, openeth heauen gates. For Per multas tribulationes oportet introire in regnum Dei,

Whereuppon S. Maximus
                  
well sayeth, that all the lyfe of a Christian, that will lyue agreeably to the Gospell, is a perpetuall crosse and martirdome. We must now acknowledge our profession, and not be ashamed of our inheritance, which Christ allotted vnto vs. We must saye with S. Paule Mundus mihi crucifixus est,

                  & ego mundo the worlde is crucified vnto me and I to the world. To put them selues in mind of this, the olde Christians in Tertullians tyme, were wonte to praye with theire armes streatched out, as men all readye crucified in mynde, and readye in Gods cause to be crucified also in bodye. Where vppon Tertullian speakinge of this gesture in prayer,

                   sayeth. Sic Itaque nos expanges vngulae fodiant, cruces suspendant, ignes lambant, gladij guttura detruncent, bestiae insiliant. Paratus est ad omne supplicium, ipse habitus orantis Christiani. Whyle we are thus prayinge with our armes spread abroade, lett the hookes digge vs, the Gibbetes hang vs, the fyers consume vs, the swordes cutt our throates, the beastes flye vppon vs, the verye behauiour of a Christian in prayer, sheweth him readye to all kynde of

tormentes. A wyse shipmaister, when he setteth forth from the shore, and goeth to sea, layinge asyde the remembrance of wyfe, children, house, and familye, employeth his bodye and mynd onlye to the due performance of his office, in auoydinge the daungers and directinge his shippe to a gaynfull hauen. You are now lanched out of the porte of worldlye prosperitye, into the sea of temporall discomforte, in Gods cause, and therefore it behoueth you to vncomber your selues of all earthlye cares. You must displaye the sayle of your soule, vppon the mast of Christes Crosse, betake you to the tacklinge of vertue, keepe your hande vppon the sterne of good order and discipline, and beinge aparted from earth, lifte vp your eyes towarde heauen. You must directe your course by the motion of the starres, and planettes, that is by the example of former Saintes, that so hauinge Christ for your Pilott, the inspirations of the holy Ghost for your gale, you maye goe through the stormes of persecution, ouercome the surges of worldlye pleasure, passe the shelfes of

alluringe occasions, auoyde the shipwracke of deadlye offence, and finallye safelye arryue to the porte of lyfe and perfitt repose. Now is the tyme wherof the spouse in person of the Churche sayde,
                     Can. 4
                   
                  Surge Aquilo & veni Auster, perfla hortum meum, et fluant aromata illius. Arise north, and come southwynde blowe my gardeyne, and lett the spice therof flow downe. These windes now blow, & it is now tyme, that the spice fall & the vertues & constant examples of Saints, that laye hidden, and couered amongst the leaues, be with this persecution shaken from them and layde open for euery one to gather. We must now ascend ad Montem mirrhae to the mounte of mirrhe, which is in taste bitter, and Ad collem Thuris to the hill of frankincense, that giueth no sweete sauour but whē it is by fyer resolued. Our heauenly smith hath now brought vs into the forge of triall, and kyndled the coales of persecution, to proue whether we be pure golde and fitt to be layde vp in his trea surye. Now whyle this winde is stirring, commeth the winnoer with his fanne to see who is blowen awaye lyke lyghte

chaffe, and who resisteth to the blastes lyke massye wheate. That which lyeth hidd in the younge blade of corne, is displayed in the ripe eare, that which is concealed in the flower, is vttered in the fruite. Many beleeuers are deemed aequall whome triall prooueth of vnequall fayth, the tribunall sheweth what was couered in the budd, agreeablye to that sayinge by theire fruite you shall knowe them. Manye flowers promise a multitude of fruite, but when they are once putt to the proofe by stormes of wynde, verye few perseuer to the full grouth. So manye seeme faythfull in the calme of the Churche, but when the blastes of aduersitye bluster agaynst them, few are founde in the fruite of martirdome. The conninge of the Pilott is not knowne till the tempest riseth, nor the Captaynes courage till the warre beginneth, nor the Catholickes constancye till the Persecutor rageth.
                     Tertul. de fuga in persecut.
                   Persecution as Tertullian noteth is Pala quae Dominicam aream purgat scilicet ecclesiam, confusum aceruum fidelium euentilans, discernens frumentum martirum, & paleas negatorum. The shulue which purgeth

our Lordes floore, that is the Church, fāning the confused heape of the faithfull and seueringe the corne of Martirs, from the chaffe of deniers. This is the ladder which Iacob dreamed of,
                     Gene. 28
                   which shewed to some the waye into heauen, and to others the descent into hell. This is the water of contradiction by which Gods seruauntes are proued according to that Probasti in tentatione,
                  
                     Deut. 33
                   
                  iudicasti ad aquas contradictionis. Thou hast taken triall by tentation, and iudged vs at the waters of contradiction. This is the water at which our heauenlye Gedeon, trieth who are fitt soldiers to assist him agaynst the Madianites,
                  
                     Iud. 7
                   and he seuereth such as fall on theire knees for greedines and thirst of worldly vanityes, from those that reach with their hande, so much onlye as their necessity requireth. Of whome God sayeth in tre centis viris qui lambuerunt aquas, liberabo vos. In those three hundred men that haue licked the waters will I deliuer you.
                     Chrisost. Hom 29 in Ep. ad Rom.
                   
                  S. Chrisostome reporteth that the shepherdes of Capadocia, for the care they haue of their flockes, many times lye three dayes together couered with

snow, and they of Libia are contented whole monethes, to wander after their flockes in those desertes, that are full of cruell wilde beastes, preferring the care of their catell, before their owne daungers. How much more are the Pastores yea al the Catholikes of this time, boud to endure the pinchinge and freesinge colde of what aduersitye soeuer, yea and the hazardes of cruell persecutors, that lyke wylde beastes haue turned this vinevard of our contrye into a bar ren desert, rather thē to suffer so much as in vs lyeth, Christes flocke ether to be scandalized by our example, or destitute of our necessarye endeuours. For as in a serious & earnest battayle, wher vppon the state of the common welth depended, and the King him selfe were in cōplet harnesse, & with his weapons ready in person to fight for his kingdōe. If anye of his nobles, should come into the fielde with a fanne of fethers in steed of a buckler, and a poesye of flow ers in steede of a sworde, and in euerye other respect more like a carpet knight then a man of armes, The Kinge could not but take it in verye euill parte: So

surelye must Christ if in this spirituall warre agaynst his Churche, for which he fought in person, and receyued so manye woundes, we should looke on more lyke worldly wantones, then true soldiers, and not be as readye as our Kinge & Capteyne to venture our liues in the same quarell. Now therefore is the tyme, that it standeth vs vppon, to shew proofe of our selues. Now must it be knowne whether we be vasa in honorem or contumeliam, Vessels of honour or reproch, whether we be signed with the name of the lambe, or touched with the marke of the beast Antichriste,
                     Apoc. l4
                   whether we be of the wheate or of the cockle, and finallye whether we belong to the flocke of Christ or to the herd of Beliall.

                   Your lodginge of the prison, you accounte your barne. For though the prisons be in them selues foldes of Satan to harbour his lewde flocke, yett when the cause ennobleth the name of a prisoner, the prisoner abolisheth the dishonour of the place. What thing of olde more odious then the Crosse, what place more abhorred, then the mounte Caluarie, what roomes more reprochefull then the Criptes, grottes, and dungeons of Saintes. Yett now what thing more honorable then the holye Crosse, what place more reuerenced, then the foresayde mounte, what sanctuaries more desired, then the dungeons of Saintes. So doth

God defeate the Deuill of his vsuall hauntes, and of kenels ordeyned for the couching of his hell houndes, frameth mansions of greate merite, & portes of saluation for his owne seruaunts. A reprochefull thing it is, to be cheyned in sinne, gyued in wickednesse, and shutt vpp in the deadlye prison of mortall offence. A miserable thing it is, to be enthralled in the vassalage of the deuill, in the seruile subiection to our lawlesse appetites, and in the slauishe bondage of worldlye vanityes.

O pedes compedibus & trauersarijs interim cunctabundi, sed celeriter ad patriam glorioso itinere cursuri. O feete happelye cheyned which are directed a safe waye to paradyse. O feete for a tyme foreslowed, with fetters and boltes, but shall hereafter with a glorious iorneye swiftelye runne vnto their contrye. Honorable it is in Gods quarell, to be abridged of bodilye libertye, for mainteyning the true libertye and freedome of our soule. The birdes beinge vsed and naturallye delighted with the full scope of the ayre, though they be

neuer so well fedd in the Cage yett are they all wayes pooringe at euery cranie to see whether they maye escape. For why, they vnderstand not, that in the Cage they are both surer from the kyte hauke, and fouler, then abroade, neyther marke they the benefitt of theire assured repayre, from harde weather and worse foode. But for a reasonable creature, and withall a Christian Catholicke so much to affecte a daungerous libertye, as not to accounte of the benefitt of his prison in so good a cause, it can not but be thought an imperfection, especiallye consideringe how manye perils of our soule are cutt of, and how highlye our spirituall welfare is aduaunced. Lett vs not in this be lyke the senselesse byrdes, but rather imitate them in an other propertye, which is, that in the cage they not onlye singe their naturall note, both sweetlyer and oftener, then abroade, but learne also diuerse other, farre more pleasant, and delightsome, So we both keepe, and oftener practise our wonted deuotions, and besydes learne new exercises of vertue, both for our owne comfort, and

example of other. And when might you so freelye range emongest the quires of Angels, as when you are sequestred from the distractions of vaine companye? when could you take a fuller repast of the sweete fruites of prayer and contemplation, then when the onions, garlicke, and fleshe pottes of Egipt are farthest out of sent and sight? Your eyes are not to much troubled with impious and wicked sightes, your eares not annoyed with bloodye outcryes and heynous blasphemies. You are quitt from many scandals, and seuered from occasion of diuers tentations. Finallye thincke not of the name of a prison, and you shall finde it a retyringe place fittest to serue God. If it restrayne you of temporall comfortes, your bootye is gainfull, that by losse of transitorye deserue eternall. If your bodye be chastised your soule is cherished, and the pyninge of the one is the pamperinge of the other. You forsake a paradyse of of poysening delightes, for a place that yeldeth cause of grounded and true solaces. Yea and as Tertullian noteth if you way from whence you came, and

where you are, you shall fynd, that you are rather deliuered out, then committed into prison. Greater darknesse hath the worlde, which inueigleth and blindeth not onlye the eyes, but the hartes of men. Heuyer cheynes and shackles doth the worlde lay on vs, which doe fetter and entangle our verye soules. Farr worse ordure and stenche doth the worlde breath out. I meane ribaldrye, carnallitye, and all kynde of brutishe behauiour. Finallye more prisoners & guiltye persons hath the worlde, the whole generation of mankynde, not to be iudged by the vmpiershippe of anye earthlye magistrate, but by the censure and verdicte of almighty God. Happye therfore are you, if you can recken your selues translated out of prison, into a place of preseruation, which if it be combred with darcknesse, your selues are lampes to light it, If it charge you with gyues, yett are you loose and vnbound towardes God. If you be pestered with vnsauery smell, you are frankincense and sauour of sweetnesse. If it affright you with expectatiō of iudges.

                     Cipri. Ep. 56
                   O blessed prison sayeth he which your presence hath honored. O blessed prison that sendeth the men of God to heauen. O darknesse brighter then the sunnne it selfe, and more cleere then the light of this worlde, where the temples of God are now placed, and your members sanctified with your diuine confessions of your fayth. Lett them complayne of the difficultyes of the prison, that haue fastened their affection vpon worldlye vanityes. A Christian Catholicke, euen out of prison hath renounced the worlde in his baptisme, and it litle importeth in what place he be in the world, who by promise and profession, hath vowed neuer to be of it. Lett them complayne of the prison, that knowe not the glorye and soueraigne prerogatiue of that place, but for a Catholike, that hath Christ for his auctor, the Apostles for his witnesses, all former Saintes for testimonyes howe honorable it is, to suffer in Gods quarell. It is a greate shame not to thincke worthilye and reuerentlye therof. One

that knoweth not the vertue of herbes, when he walketh in the fieldes, or hils, without any regard treadeth vnderfoote whatsoeuer groweth in his waye, making no more accounte of one herbe then of an other, but if he come into a Phisicians house, where he seeth manye, not onlye holsome herbes, but to his thinckinge stronge and vnsauerye weedes, he neuerthelesse conceyueth, that there is in them some secrett vertue to cure diseases, And if he see the experience of theire operation muche more accounteth he of them, and wheras before he trampled with contempt vppon them, he now would be as carefull to gather them: Euen so one that knoweth not the vertue and honour of the Crosse, cheynes & prisons of Christ, despiseth and abhorreth them as contemptible & dishonorable thinges, but if he come into this schoole of our heauenlye Phisician, I meane the scripture, and there see these thinges had in accounte, and view the strange operation of them, not onlye in Christ him selfe, but in S. Paule S. Ihon Baptist & others, how can he choose but haue them in

greate esteeme, and be readye if occasion serue, to trye the force thereof in his owne selfe, howsoeuer the ignorant iudge them as vnprofitable weeds, and badges of disgrace. What place of more price then Kinges Pallaces, yea what place so glorious as heauen: and yett S. Chrisostome sayeth that kings courtes,

                   and heauen it selfe yeldeth to the glory of the prison, that harboreth Christes prisoner. For as the Princes presence honoreth the basest cottage, and maketh it more esteemed and resorted vnto, then the most statelye buildinges. So the presence of Gods prisoner in the most infamous dungeon, maketh it a courte and resorte of Angels, and a paradyse where God him selfe delighteth to walke and taketh pleasure in the constancye of his afflicted seruantes. For such is the honor that the cheynes giue him that is a captiue in Gods quarell, that his roome what soeuer it be, is honorable, and he by his fetters more richely adorned, then he could be with anye Princely or imperiall robes. Mardocheus was not so much honored with Assuerus royall garmentes, nor Salomon
                  
so glorious in his costliest habitt, nor Herode so adorned when he sought in his gorgeous attyre to boast him selfe for a god, as S. Ihon Baptist was, when he had atchiued that title Ioannes in vinculis Ihon in cheynes. Yea imagin not onlye what pompe hath of any Emperour or worldly potentate ben shewed, In golde, iewels, or anye ornamentes of highest price, but also what might be shewed, if mans wishe might be putt in execution, yett maye it still be sayed with S. Chrisostom. Pudet diuitias et auream munditiē huiusmodi conferre vinculis.
                  
                     Ibidem.
                   I am ashamed to compare riches, or the purenesse of golde, with such cheynes. For in truth they are but base comparisons, in respect of other things of greter preeminence, whiche neuerthelesse amoūt not to the dignitye of beinge cheyned for Gods cause. It was a great prerogatiue to be an Apostle, a Doctour, an Euanglist. It was a singuler fauour, to be rapt into paradyse, and to the third hea

                     Chrisost. Ibid
                   And yett S. Chrisostome of these thinges sayeth, Admiranda quidem fuerunt ista, sed non qualia illa Cae sum autem multis plagis, coniecerunt in carcerem. Merueylous thinges were these but not lyke to those other, whipped with manye stripes they cast him into prison. And this S. Paule him selfe seemed to acknowledge in th
                     •
                  t he writinge to Philemon, he omitteth his vsuall style, of Paulus Apostolus or seruus Iesu Christi Paule an Apostle, or seruant of Iesus Christ, & begineth his epistle with Paulus vinctus Iesu Christi Paule a prisoner of Iesus Christ. Wherin he seemeth to follow the custome of great personages, who when from inferiour dignityes they are enhanced to more honorable titles, they alwayes in theire letters omitting the other, sett downe their principall style, proper to theire new atchiued prefermente. But now to speake of the highest glorye, whiche men chiefely esteeme, what place more acceptable then heauen, what seate more to be wished then the thrones on Gods right hande, what company comparable

to the felowshippe of Angells, what dignitye so greate as to be one of the celestiall spirittes, that haue theire roome next vnto God? And yet S. Chrisostom thought S. Paules prison a worthyer place, his clogges and cheynes worthyer seates, his fellowe captiues more honorable companye, and the state of Christes prisoner a more surpassing dignitie. And if you aske the cause, he will answere, for that it is more glorious to a stout soldier, more pleasant to a true louer, to suffer for their Captayne, and laboure in seruice of their Loue, then to be honoured by them. Potius mihi habetur affici pro Christo, quam honoraria Christo. I account it more honorable, sayeth he, for Christ to be trobled, then of Christ to be honored. For if Christ becomminge man, stripping him selfe in a manner of his maiestye, thought it not so honorable to be in his glorye, as for vs vppon the Crosse, how much more ought we to deeme it a singuler preferment, to suffer for his sake. The Apostles did greatlye reioyce, that they were vouchsafed with this honour.
                     Act. 5

                  cell, for that they were thoughte worthye to suffer reproche for the name of Iesus. But we neuer reade, that they so reioyced at their power ouer deuils, the gyfte of miracles, or other lyke especiall fauours, which well declareth how muche they prised theire persecution, more then theire authoritye. And therfore Christ sayde Beati estis not for commaunding deuils, not for raysinge the dead, or healing the lame, or working of infinite wonders:

                   But beati estis cum maledixerint vobis homines, & persecuti vos fuerint, & dixerint omne malum aduersus vos, mentiētes propter me. You are blessed whē men hate you, and persecute you and speake all the euill they can agaynste you, belying you for my sake. But if it were a blessednesse to worke wonders, in this respect also the cheynes of Christ were able to make vs blessed. What greater miracles, then for those that are fast bounde,
                     Act. 16
                   to vnloose? for those that haue their handes manacled, and theire feete fettered, to shake the foundations

of the prison? to open without key or other materiall instrument locked & fast barred dores. To vncheyne not onlye the fast bound bodyes, but the enthralled & captiue soules. What stranger thing then the same cheyne, that byndeth the bodye in earthe, to bynde the soule to God in heauen, to make a prison of miscreantes, a church of Christians, and the nest of vipers, a nurcerye of Saintes. What greater wonder then Iaylours to desire to be vnbounde, by theire cheyned Captiues, and yelde them selues voluntarye prisoners to those, whome they violentlye kept in durance. And if these seeme smale matters, consider what reuerēce the verye senselesse and vnreasonable creatures beare vnto Christes cheynes. The Viper durst not stinge the hand of S.

In these haue all we afflicted Catholickes our chiefe confidence, hoping, that their cheynes will pleade for vs, theire prisons protecte vs, and their prayers obteyne vs some end of our miseryes. We doubt not, but Dominus de coelo in terram aspexit,

of the good, if you be disgraced of men, you maye righte well looke for your prayse from God. S. Ihon Baptist was alwayes worthy of honour, both in respect of his rough habitt, his hard dyet, his innocent lyfe, his hye function, and greate Prerogatiues. Yett so longe as he was at libertye, that the people rann admiring his lyfe, and reuerencing his person, we here no great mention made by Christ of him, but when he was once become Ioannes in vinculis Ihon in cheines fallen into worldlye disgrace,

                   & preferred to this Christian honour, the Capteyne strayt sounded the souldiers renoume, and God him selfe rehersed the catologue of his diuine prayses. Which though they alwayes were so greate, that they could neuer haue bene worthily enough by mans tongue rehersed, yett were they neuer so worthy to be vttered by Christes owne mouthe, as when they had their chiefe complement and perfection, which was the honour of his cheynes. Now let the captyues of the world flatter them selues with the vayne title of liberty. Lett them triumphe in their

cheynes of golde, in theire iewels of perle, and pretious stone, in their gorgeous and statelye robes. Lett them bost of theire freedome, when euerye thridde and ornament about them, is a manifest marke of theire captiuitye. When I saye theire tongues are thrall to Potentates eares, theire action and all theire behauiour framed to the likinge of greate personages eyes, their sense bodyes and myndes seruyle to their owne sensualityes. It is with them as S. Chrisostome noteth as with Kinges,
                     Chrisost. Hom 18. in 1. Ep. ad Tim.
                   that are taken captiues by a barbarous Prince, who for their greater ignominye, and his owne glorye, suffereth them to keepe on their princely robes, and to were their crounes and in this attyre forceth them to most base & seruyle offices. For so these that on the one syde, by their brauerye seeme of great might, and at large libertye, on the other if you consider their slauishe actions, most base and filthye, and theire daylye drudgerye in sinne, you can not but deeme thē so much the more miserable, in that seeming glorious, they are inthralled in so heauye a bondage. For

as often tymes the lightening though it leaue the veluet and costlye scaberd whole, yet it consumeth the more worthye thing that is the sworde, whiche by the lightnes of the scaberd is easely perceyued: So that pernicious fierflash of sinne, thoughe it leaue the bodye and goodes sounde, and impayre not the outwarde state, yett kylleth it the soule, and leaueth it dead, wherof the gaudye lightnes of their outwarde behauiour, is no obscure signe. Lett vs not yelde to suche follye, but rather reioyce in our enclosure, and glorye in our bandes, remembring that the longer we weare them, the more honour we shall purchase by them, and the better we lyke them, the more benefitte shall we reape of them. Semel vincit sayeth S. Ciprian,

He hath but one victorye, that strayte suffereth, but he that alwayes dwelling in payne, doth encounter with sorowe, & is not conquered, is euerye daye crowned. And agayne blessed is that parte emongest you, sayeth the same Sainte, that

remayneth in prison, ad meritorum titulos ampliores tormentorum tarditate proficiens, habitura tot mercedes in coelestibus praemijs quot nunc dies numerantur in paenis. Proceedinge by the lingringe of your tormentes to more ample titles of meritt, and sure to haue so manye rewardes in the heauenlye paymente as there are dayes reckoned in presēt paynes. These are the true ornamentes for Christians to bost of. This captiuitye is our principall freedome, and the prisons are portes where God harboureth with vs here and from whence he conueyeth vs into the shore of eternall faelicitye. Of this sayeth S. Ciprian.

They haue putt shacles vpon your fecte, and haue bounde your happye members temples of God with infamous cheynes, as though the spiritt coulde be bounde with the bodye, or your golde could be stayned with the contagion of their iron.

                  & fidem suam religiosa virtute testantibus, ornamenta sunt ista non vincula, nec Christianos pedes ad infamiam copulant sed clarificant ad coronam. To men consecrated vnto God, and with religious vertue professing their fayth, these are not cheynes but ornamentes, neyther doe they fetter Christian feete to their infamye, but honour them to their croune and glorye. Of this did Salomon forewarne vs, shewinge vs the protection and care that God hath of those, that suffer for him, and how glorious estate they be in. Descenditque cum eo in foueam, & in vinculis non dereliquit illum, donec afferret illi sceptrum regni, & potentiam aduersus eos, qui eum deprimebant, & mendaces ostendit, qui maculauerunt eum,

Remēber therfore

the goale and you shall comfortablye passe ouer the race, regarde not so muche where you are, as where you shalbe. Thinke not so much of the comfortes that you want, as of the wage that you winne. Grieue not at the companye from which you are barred, but reioyce in that to which you are prepared, and assure your selues that how few soeuer you see, yett are you not alone, to whome Christ and his Angels haue continuall accesse. Solus non est cui Christus comes est,

Ciprian) who hath Christ for his pheere, he is not a lone that keeping the temple of God, vndefiled, where soeuer he be, without God he is neuer. Finallye considering that our lyfe is but a warfare and we alwayes in the field agaynst our professed enemyes, to whom in our baptisme we badd battayle by defiynge and renouncing them: Seing also the times be such that those whiche sticke vnto the truthe, are in a manner designed to the slaughterhouse, in so muche that we maye truelye saye,

                  Propter te mortificamur

tota die, aestimati sumus velut oues occisionis: For thy sake we are mortified all the daye, & are accounted as sheepe for the butcherye: These thinges I saye considered, lett vs take our prison as a place of preparatiō, & a priuate schoole of exercyse, to trayne and instructe vs, for the publicke, serious, and moste sharpe frayes. For as Tertullian sayeth,
                     Tertul. li. ad Martires.
                   It is not for the aduantage or behoofe of a valiant soldier, to come from disportes to bloodye strokes, or from the carpett to the campe, but it is necessarye to be hardened firste in roughe treatye of them selues, in harde vsage and toylesome trauayles. For so in peace, they shall learne to disgest the disasters and incommodityes of warre, and by these forerunning laboures inure their bodye to vnease, and foster the courage and prowesse of theire myndes. Happye therefore are you, what troubles soeuer you susteyne, for the exercyse of youre vertue, and better inhabling both of bodye & mynde. Such was the preparatiō of the champions & soldiers of profe in former ages. They were restrayned of libertye, withhelde

from chamber worke, straytned in their diett, from sweete meates, and pleasant drinckes, The more they were laboured, the better they were liked, and the more tormoyled in trouble, the more hope they had of the victory: knowinge that vertue and constancye, that with hardnesse and rigoure gathereth force, with softnesse and ease doth languishe and fall to ruyne. This did they in regard of a corruptible croune, which they were nether certayne to attayne, nor sure to possesse. We therefore ayminge at an incorruptible rewarde, lett vs recken the prison a place of triall, that we maye be broughte vnto iudgment well fortefied agaynst all encounters, and be able to saye vnto the iudge that, Quantum formidinis & terroris attulit,

                  pe, and liue in sorowe, that we shalbe despised, and put to shame, and haue no reste of bodye, nor perfecte contentmente of mynde. We are assured on the other syde, that in the nexte lyfe our rewarde is greate, our repose without trouble, and our comforte without crosse. Our teares shalbe turned into triumphe, our disgrace into glorye, all our miseryes into perfect felicitye. Who therfore would not reioyce quickly to dye; seing that death is the passage from this worlde to the nexte, from all the presente

agreeuances, to all possible happynesse. Well maye the brute beastes feare death, whose ende of lyfe is the conclusion of their being. Well maye the Epicure tremble, who with his lyfe, looketh to lose his felicitye. Well may the Infidels, heretickes, or vnrepentant sinners quake, whose death is the beginning of their damnation. Such as here haue their heauen, and haue made their prison their praradise: those whose bellye was their god, and their appetites theire guides, maye with reasone rue theire death, seing they haue no portion in the lande of the liuinge. They haue sowne in sinne, and what can they looke to reape but miserye, vanityes were their traficke, and griefe wil-be their gayne, detestable was their life, & damnable wilbe their decease. Of suche it is verified,
                     Eccl. 4

sinners decease. But pretious is the death of saintes in the sight of our Lorde. Here they haue their payne, and in heauen they looke for their payment. Here they haue sowne in teares, and there they shall reape in ioye. Their Iudge is he, for whome they haue suffered, and therefore doubtlesse wilbe mercifull. Their accusers are made dūme, by their former repentance, and therfore cannot be preiudiciall. Their conscience is cleered by humble confession, and therfore cannot be fearfull. Hope is theire staffe to keepe them from sliding, rightuousnesse their safe conduite, to warrant them from arrestyng, grace is their guide, to keepe them from erring. Their woundes and sufferings in Gods cause, are rewardes to assure them of comfortable intertaynment. Their frayes and wrastlinges against their owne passions, are badges of perfection and will finde free accesse. Finallye the hell that here they haue passed, will acertayne them of obtayning a crowne in heauen. They are goodlye fruite, more fitt for the golden plate, and Kinges table, then to hange longer on a rotten bough. They

are pleasant and sweete roses, more worthye to be honoured in the Princes hande, then lefte vpon a thorny stalke. Yea they are glorious rubies, rather to be sett in the crowne of glorye, then here to be trodden vnder foote by dirtye swyne. What can they see in this world to with holde them.

They mounte, as hye as heauen, and fall, as lowe, as hell and for the tyme so amaze them, that their life pined away in miseries. For they are tossed, and made to stagger lyke a drouncken man with continual varietye of newe surges and grieues, and all their wisdome in patiently suffering, & firmely hopinge of Gods helpe, is deuoured, and to the eye vnprofitable against their enemyes rage. And therfore they cryed vnto our Lord, when they were distressed in this daūgerous manner, and desired to haue a shorte cut to theire voyage end, and esteemed it a singuler benefitt, that he led them by death out of their necessities, and so altered their storme into a calme wind, and guided them in the hauen of theire owne willes, that is the hauen of securitye, in which they most desired to be. If they consider the poore, their lyfe is lead in such agonye, payne & needynesse, that it maketh euery one to loath it. If they beholde the rich and mightye, their felicitye is follye, and their ioye is vanity. If they looke on Potentates, that seeme

the very flower of mankinde, they finde oftentimes, that they are poore in their riches, abiect in their honours, discontented in their delightes.

                   present thinges alwayes endynge, and thinges paste are quite dead and donne. For while we

liue, we dye, and then we leaue dyeinge, when we leaue liuinge. Better therfore it is to dye to lyfe, then to liue to death: because our mortal lyfe is nothing, but a liuing death. And lyfe continually flyeth from vs, and cannot be with-helde; and death howrely commeth vppon vs, and cannot be withstood. No armoure resisteth, no threatning preuayleth, no intreaty profiteth, against deaths assalte. If all other perilles & chaūces spare our lyfe, yet tyme and age, in the ende will consume it. We see the fludd, that riseth in the top of a Mountayne, to fall & roule downe with a continuall noyse: It gusheth out with a holowe and horse sound, then it runneth roaring down, ouer craggye and rough clyffes, and is continuallye crushed and broaken with diuers encounters, til at the foote of the hill, it entereth into the Sea. And so fareth it with mans lyfe, he commeth into the worlde with payne, and beginneth his course with pitifull cryes, and continually molested with diuers vexations, he neuer ceaseth running doune, til in the ende he fall into the Sea of death. Neyther

is our last houre the beginning of our death, but the conclusion, and then it is come that hath bene longe in the comming, and fullye finished, that was still in the ending. Why therfore shold we be vnwlling to lese, that which cannot be kept? Better it is since death is debte, and natures necessarye wracke, to folowe S. Chrisostomes counsell.

                   it was, a smoake, and it vanished. It was a buble, and it was dissolued. It was a spinners webb, and it was shaken a sunder. No wise-man lamenteth, that he liued not a yeare sooner then he was borne, and whye shoulde he lament, that within a yeare or lesse, he shall liue no longer. For he leeseth nothing, that then he had, and he shall

be to the world but as thē he was God made Adames garment of dead beasts skinnes,
                     Gen. 3.
                   to put him in minde, that he was condemned to dye; and to make the remembrance of death familiar vn to him, that the losse of lyfe might not affright him who alwayes caryed the liuerye of deathe vppon him. And as Daniell by spreadding ashes in the Temple discouered the treacherye,
                     Dan 14.
                   and falshood of the Priestes of Babilonia: So by poudering our thoughtes, and memorye with the duste of our graue, and often repetition of our decease, we shall soon discrye the vanitye of this lyfe, the traines of the diuell, and our secrete temptations to be such, as we would rather wishe by losing of lyfe to cutt of, then by auoyding death to continue. If any thing make death tedious, it is the wante of the consideration of it. The old men haue it right before them, the yonge men hard behinde them, all men daylye ouer them, and yet we forget it. Familiarytye with Lions taketh awaye the feare of them, the being vsed to tempestes geueth harte and courage to endure them, and in warre the seinge so

manye howrely bereaued of lyfe, maketh the soldier litle or nothing to sett by it. If therfore we wilbe out of all feare of death, lett vs continuallye remember it. If we vse our horse to the race before we runne for the wager; If we accquaint our selues with the weapons before we fighte for the victorye; Much more sholde we take heede, that we come not dispourueyed to this laste combat. The good Pylot, when he guideth his shipp, he sitteth at the sterne in the hinder parte therof, and so the prouident Christian to directe his lyfe, must alwayes sit at the end of the same, that the mindfulnes of death being his sterne, he may feare it the lesse and prouide for it the better. This is the dore wherby we must go out of bondage, & therfore, as the prisoner that standeth vppon his deliuerye, taketh greatest comfort in sitting vpon the threshold, that when the dore is opened, he maye the sooner gett out: So ought we alwayes to haue our minde fixed vppon the laste steppe of our lyfe, ouer which we are sure, that passe we muste, though how, or when we know not. For this

cause that holy man Ioannes Eleemosinarius Patriarke of Allexandrya hauing his Tombe in building, commaunded that it shold be lefte imperfect, and that his seruauntes euerye daye, shoulde putt him in minde to finishe the same, that hauinge hys eye alwayes fixed vppon this dore of death, he might the better prepare for the passage through it. The memorye of death is the ashes, wherin the fire of vertue being raked vpp, it continueth the better, and wilbe fitter to enkindle the courage of our mind, that when death commeth in deede, & these ashes shalbe vnraked, we maye rather reioyce, that our flame hath found a vente to mount to hir natural Sphere, where it will shine to our glorye, then sorowe, that it parteth out of the chimnye of our fleshe, where it was in daunger to be quenched with our iniquitye. It was not without cause that God likened death to a theefe. For as the theefe when hee findeth the man of the house watchinge, and vppon his garde he saluteh him in curteous sorte, and taketh vppon him the person of a friende; but yf he finde him a sleepe, he

cruellye murdereth him, and robbeth his treasurye: So death, to those, that are prepared for it, is verye cōfortable, and to those onlye terrible that sleepe in sinne, and are carelesse of their ende. And to these belongeth that sayinge, The deathe of the sinners is worste. Euill because it seuereth from the worlde, worse because it seuereth from the bodye, and worste of all because it seuereth from God. For why; they make the worlde their Parradise, their bodye their god, and God their enemye. To suche death is hatefull, for that therin they are tormented with the panges of of the dyeing fleshe, amazed with the fittes and corrasiues of the mynd, frighted with the terrour of that which is to come, greeued with remorse of that which is paste. They are stunge with the gnawing of a guiltye conscience, discomforted with the rigoure of a seuere Iudge, annoyed with the thought of their lothsome sepulchre. And thus though death of it selfe be not bitter, yet is it bitter, to the wicked. And yet (as S. Ambrose noteth) euen to them is lyfe more bitter then death.
For more

greeuous is the liuinge to sinne, then the dyinge in sinne. For the wicked while he liueth increaseth his offence, and when he dyeth offendeth no more, and therfore by his lyfe he agumenteth his tormentes, and by his death he abridgeth the same. It is the feare of death, that maketh it terrible, & is not in deed so greeuous to dye, as to liue in perpetuall feare, and expectation of death.
                        Ecclesi. 1.
                      For he that feareth God, shall make a good ende, and in the daye of his decease he shalbe blessed. And happye are the dead,

                      that dye in our Lord, from hence forth (sayeth the spirite) they shall reste from their laboures, for theire woorkes doe followe them.

They (as S. Augustine sayeth) bycause their desire is to be loosed, and to be with Christe, endure to liue with patience, & are readye to dye with ioye. They feare not death because they feared God in lyfe. They feare not death, because they rather feared lyfe; And an euil deathe,

is but the effecte of an euil lyfe. Their lyfe was a studye how to dye well, and they knew, that since death passed thorough the veines of lyfe, it loste the bitternesse of death, and tooke the taste & sweetnesse of lyfe. Neyther are they amazed with the fore-goinge gripes, & extremityes, because they take them as the throwes of childebirth, by whiche our soule is borne out of this lothsome bodye, and brought forth to an eternal felicitye. They feare not the diuels, to whome they haue stoutelye resysted. They haue confidence in God, whose wrath they haue with repentaunce appeased. The horror of the graue dothe nothing moue them, because they doe but sowe therein a carnall and corruptible bodye, to reape the same in the resurrection incorruptible and spirituall. This made Simeon so ioyfullye sing Now thou releasest thy seruant O Lord,

You are vnwilling to suffer in the worlde, lothe to departe out of the worlde, what should I doe vnto you? A worthye rebuke of the loth to dye. For if the chased Harte, to auoyde the greedye houndes, flyeth often tymes to the hunters protection, and though pursued of him, yet by nature hath an affiance in his mercye; If one enemy sometimes findeth fauoure at an other enemyes hande, where he least looked for it, why should a dutyfull childe feare, to goe to his heauenly

Father, a penitent soule to his sweete Sauiour, an obedient member, to be ioyned with his head. If he came into this worlde to redeeme vs, why should we doubte, but at our death he will receyue vs, especiallye if we dye for him, as he dyed for vs. He that accepteth his enemyes, will he reiect his friendes? and he that bought vs so deere, will he refuse his penyworth? If he affecte our companye so muche in earthe, that he sayde my delyghte is to be with the children of men, hathe he now so forgotten his olde loue, as not to admitt vs to his companye in heauen? He came hether to buy vs, an inheritance, and he went from hence to prepare it for vs, and when we are to enter into posession wil he exclude vs? Who can imagin of him, that is contented here to be him selfe our food, & to abase his maiesty to enter into our soule, dwelling in this cottage of clay, & vnpleasant dungeō, that he (I saye) will not be content in our cheefest neede, to be our frende, & to aduaunce our departinge soule to the comforte of his presence?

The innocent iuste and deerest vnto God, thou thrustest out of their howses, thou spoylest of their partrimonye, thou loadest with cheynes, thou lockest in prisons, with wilde beastes, swords, and fyre thou deuourest.

besyde tormentes indured the laste brunte of death; then thinkinge themselues, most happye, when they had obtayned any meanes to departe this life. Lucretia sheathed her knife in her owne bowels to renoune her chastytie. Empedocles threwe him selfe into Aetna flames to eternize his memory.

                   And as Tertullian well noteth, haec non sine causa Dominus in seculū admisit, sed ad nos et nunc exhortandos, et in illa die, confundendos si formidauerimus pati pro veritate ad salutem, quae alij effectauerunt, pro vanitate in perditionem. Not without cause hath our Lorde permitted these exāples in the worlde, but for our present exhortation, and future confusion, if we be afrayde to beare for verytye to our saluation, that whiche others haue desyred for a vanytye to their perditiō. Now if I would stand to recite the glorious examples of those, that haue constantlye dyed in a good cause, the number is so great, their courage so glorious, that it would require a whole treatise by it selfe.

Consider the whole multitude and glorious hoste of Martyrs, whose tormentes haue bene exquisite, bloody, and with all kinde of extremytye, and yet their myndes vndaūted & stronge, and their agonyes alwayes ended with triumphe and victorye. And if all these examples be not forceible enough, to make vs not to feare death, let vs consider how manye wayes, we may of force and without merite suffer casuall mischaunces, and sodayn death; Vt illa nos instruant,
                  
                     Tertul. L. ad Mart.
                   as Tertullian sayeth, si constanter adeunda sint, quae et inuitis et eue nire consueuerunt. That those things may

benefit vs if they be constantlye endured, whiche whether we will or no are incidente vnto vs. How manye at vnawares haue bene burnte vpp in theyre owne howses, how manye slaughtered by beastes in the fieldes, how manye by the same deuoured in Cytyes? Howe many consumed in cōmon pestilences, murdered by theeues, slayne by theyr enemyes? And euen in oure dayes, how many see we not onlye desperatelye to venture in warre, to runne vppon the swordes, to contemne perilles, to be lauishe of theire lyues, but diuers also forced against their willes, to enter the same daungers, and to caste them selues awaye, and that often tymes in vniuste quarrelles, to the damnation of theyr soules. Finallye who is there, that mauger whatsoeuer he can doe, maye not suffer that by misfortune, which he feareth to suffer in Gods cause. Why therfore should we feare that, which cannot be auoyded? The verye necessitye of death, sholde make vs not vnwilling to dye, and the remembrance of our mortalytye sholde make vs litle feare, whē experyence sheweth vs mortall. Lyue

well and dye well we maye, but lyue longe, and not dye, we can-not. We should not thinke our lyfe shortened, when it is well ended. He dyeth olde enough, that dyeth good, and lyfe is better well loste, then euill kepte. We goe but that waye, by the which all the world before vs hath gone, and all that come after vs shall followe, and at the same instant with vs, thousandes from all partes of the worlde shall beare vs companie. If we be taken awaye in the flower of our age, how coulde it be better bestowed, then on him that gaue it, and all our losse therein is concluded in this, that being passengers vpon this worldlye Sea, we had a stronger gale to wafte vs sooner ouer, to our desired porte. If we dye in this cause, our pitcher is broaken ouer the fountayne, where the water is not loste, but onlye returned thether, from whence it was firste taken. We are not in prisone for thefte, or murder, that when we are called out we sholde looke for nothing but for presente death. Our bodye is our holde, our death our deliuerye, when the Iayler calleth, we haue a clere

conscience and feare not hys threatninge. If he manace death, he promiseth lyfe, and his killinge is our reuiuinge. It is a shame for a Christian to feare a blaste of mans mouth, that hath such vnuincible shores to support him, as that no man nor diuell is able to ouerthrowe them.

Complayntes of iniuries haue no place in the fielde, but euerye one marketh what reward is apoynted for those galles, woundes, and printes of the strypes, as namely the crownes, glorye, stypende, publike priuileges, portratures, and grauen Images, and such like monuments, wherwith the worlde dothe as it maye eternize them, with a certayne perpetuitye, and procure thē a continual resurrection in their posterityes remembrance.

Other Kinges and potentats, neuer conquere with out killinge, neuer tryumphe without crueltye, neuer enioye the pleasures of this lyfe, without the miseryes of many mens deathes.

maiestye, not when they murder impiously, cruelly, and brutishly: But when they suffer, humblye, stoutly, and patientlye, in his quarell. Let our aduersaryes therefore loade vs with the infamous titles of traytours, and rebels, as the Arians did in the persecution of the Vandals, and as the Ethnicks were wonte to call Christians Sarmentitios, & semiassios, because they were tyed to halfpeny stakes, and burnte with shrubbes: So lett them drawe vs vppon hurdles, hange vs, vnbowel vs alyue, mangle vs, boyle vs, and sett our quarters vppon their gates, to be meate for the byrdes of the ayre, as they vse to handle rebels: we wil aunswere them as the Christians of former persecutions haue done.

There are the companyes of all Gods Saynctes, that bathe in eternall felicytye, hauing happelye passed ouer the daungerous voyage through this wicked worlde. There is the center of our repose, the onlye seate of vnfaylyng securitye, and who can be so vnnaturall an enemye to himselfe, as to eschewe death being the bridge to so vnspeakeable contentmēt. Seeinge therfore there is so lytle cause ether to loue lyfe, or to feare deathe, and so greate motyues, to lamente that oure inhabitance is prolonged, & oure decease adiourned: Lett not their threatninges appall vs, who can onlye kille the bodye, and haue nothinge to

He that must be baptised confesseth his faythe, before the Prieste, and aunswereth whē he is demaunded. This doeth also the Martyr before the persecutoure, he acknowledgeth his fayth and aunswereth the demaunde. The baptised is eyther sprinkled, or dipped in water, but the Martyr is eyther sprinkeled with hys

blood, or not dipped but burned in fyre. The baptized by imposition of the Bishoppes handes receyueth the holye ghost. The Martyre is made a habitacle of the same spirite, while it is not he that speaketh, but the spirite of his heauenly Father that speaketh within him. The baptized receyueth the blessed Sacramente in remembraunce of the death of oure Lorde, the Martyr suffereth death it selfe for our Lorde. The baptised protesteth to renounce the vanityes of the worlde, the Martyr besyde this renounceh his owne lyfe. To the baptised all his sinns are forgeuen.
In the Martyr all his sinnes are quite extinguished.

                     pellatur, tam corona quam baptisma, quia baptiz at pariter & coronat. Therfore is Martirdome called as well a crowne, as a baptisme, for that it baptizeth & crowneth together. So that as no offence committed before baptisme can doe the baptised anye harme, so also dothe Martirdome so clense the soule from

all spot of former corruption, that it geueth ther-vnto a most vndefiled beautye. Yea and in this, Martirdome seemeth to haue a prerogatyue aboue baptisme. For though baptisme perfectlye clense the soule, and release not onlye the offence, but also the temporal punishment due vnto the same: Yet sticketh the roote of sinn in the flesh, & the partye baptysed retayneth in him, the badge and cognizance, yea the scarres and tokens of a sinner. But Martirdomes vertue is such, that it not onlye worketh the same effecte of baptisme, but purchaseth also to the soule, forth with a perfect riddance of all concupiscence and inclynation to sinne, and maketh it not only without offēce, but vnable to offende anye more. It dothe not onlye gather the fruites, or lop the braunches, or fell the tree, but plucketh it vpp by the verye rootes, and dishableth it from springing vp agayn. With the broode it killeth the dame, it consumeth both the weede and the seede together, & clenseth vs both from the myre and from the stayne and spot that remayneth after it. And therfore of

Martirs doth the Scripture say,
                     Apoc. 7
                   
                  Isti sunt qui venerunt de tribulatione magna, et lauerunt stolas suas, et dealbaucrūt eas in sanguine agni. These are they that came out of a great tribulation, and haue washed theire stoles and whited them in the bloode of the Lambe. Vppon whiche place Tertullian sayeth,

                     irio candidantur, quia & Isaias ex rufo & coccino niucum & lancum repromittit. The filth is washed away by baptisme, but the staynes are cleered by Martirdome, for Esay promiseth that redd and scarlet should become as white as snowe or woll: As who sholde saye, so much more forcible is martirdome then baptisme, as the water, that taketh out dirte and stayne together, then that which washing the dirte awaye leaueth the stayne behinde it. Not that this stayne importeth any sinne, but the infirmity which originall sinne hath caused, and of which actuall sinne proceedeth. So that baptisme taketh away our falte, & martirdome our frayltye, baptisme geueth vs the keye, but martirdome letteth vs in. That maketh vs members of the millitant, this

of the tryumphante Churche, that geueth vs force to walke to our iourneis end, and to fight for the victorye, but this setleth vs in repose, and crowneth our conquest. Baptisme bringeth vs forthe as the mother dothe the childe, to which though she geue most of those partes which are in men, yet some she geueth not, and those that she geueth are so impotent & weake, that though they may be vsed in childishe actions, yet not to the principall thinges that man needeth, till by processe of tyme they be farther enhabled. For so baptisme geueth vs grace, wherby we maye weakely turne the powers of our mind to God, and haue an obscure and in a manner a childish kinde of knowledge, & loue of him. But the chiefe actions, wherin our felicitye consisteth, ensewe not strayghte vppon our baptisme, but with longe toyle we must laboure for them, before we can attayne to so great habilytye. But martirdome bringeth vs forthe as the Lyonesse dothe her whelpe. Which breeding but one in all her lyfe, beareth it six and twentye monethes in her bellye, till it grow perfect

in proportion, hable and stronge of all the lymmes, armed with all the clawes, and not so muche but with all euen the cheeke teeth full growen. So that it commeth forth with full make, and free from the impotencye of other broode, as Epiphanius writeth.

                   And thus martirdome doth with our soule, bringing it forth with such perfection, that it is strayght enhabled, to haue the perfect syght and loue of God, wherin consisteth our blisse and happynesse, without any delaye of further grouth, or sufficiency. In the baptisme of water (saith S. Thomas) the Passion of Christe worketh, by a certayne figuratiue representation, in the baptisme of spirite by a desyre and affection, in the baptisme of bloode by perfecte imitation. Lykewyse the power of the holy ghost worketh in the first by secret vertue, in the seconde by commotion of the mynde, in the thirde by feruour of perfect loue. So muche therefore as immitation in deede, is better then representation in the figure, and desyre in the thoughte: So muche doth the baptisme of blood, surpasse those of water and spirite. Baptisme

is the cloude by which Moyses guided Gods people,

We call their natall dayes, whē the life of martyrdome, and the glorye of their Fayth, while it putteth thē to a temporall death, begetteth them to eternall lyfe, and with a shorte payne bringeth them forth to perpetuall pleasure. Worthely are they called birth dayes by the whiche, they that were borne into this myserye of mans frayltye, sodaynly are borne agayne to glory, taking of theire end & death, a beginning of an endles lyfe. For if we call those birth dayes, in which in sinn & sorow we are borne to

sorowe in this worlde, more iustly may these be called birth dayes, wherin frō corruptible lyght, they come into the brightnesse of the next worlde, and the sonnes of men ascende to the adoption of a heauenlye Father. Whiche consideratiōs, were enough to encorage vs to be rather greedy of martyrdome, being so glorious a thing, then anye waye slacke in imbracinge it,

Whose gloryous course is verye fitlye expressed in the silk-worme, which first eating it selfe out of a verye lytle seede, groweth to be a small worme, afterwarde when by feeding a certaine time vppon freshe & greene leaues it is waxed of greater syse, eateth it selfe agayne out of the other coate and worketh it selfe into a case of silke, which when it hath once finyshed in the ende castinge the seede for manye younge to breede of, and leauing the silke for mans ornament, dyeth all white and winged in shape of a flyeinge thinge. Euen so the martyrs of the Catholicke Church, first breake out of the dead seede of original sinne by baptisme; then, when by feedinge on the Sacramentes and leaues of Gods worde, they are growne to more rypenesse, castinge the coate of worldlye vanityes, they cloath them selues with the silke of vertue, and perfection of lyfe, in whiche worke perseuering to the ende, euen when the persecution is greatest, they finallye as need

requireth, shedd their blood, as seede for newe ofspring to arise of, and leaue moreouer the silke of their vertues as an ornamente to the Church. And thus departe white for theyre good workes, and winged with innocency of handes, and cleanes of harte they presentlye flye to theyre heauenlye repose, agreeablye to Dauides saying Quis ascendet in montem Domini?
                  
                     Ps. 23.
                   
                  Innocens manibus & mundo corde. Who shall ascend to the mount of God, The innocent of handes and cleane of harte. So that thoughe the rype fruite of the Church be gathered, yet their blood engendereth new supplye, and it increaseth the more, when the disincrease therof is vyolentlye procured. It is lyke the bush that burned & was not cōsumed.

and of her ashes, there firste breedeth a litle worme, which in the ende becommeth a Phaenix agayne: So the Martirs, when they see it necessarye for Gods glorye, hauing gathered a pyle of vertue and good woorkes, in the mount of the Catholike Churche, and gotten that bundle of which the Spouse speaketh Fasciculus mirrhae dilectus meus mihi,

                   the greate goodnes of our God, so plentyful of mercye, and so cunning an artificer of our saluation, by setting before our eyes the hye rewarde of vertue, will haue the merytes of martyrs to be our patronage, and while in the harde conflicte of martirdome, he cōmendeth vnto vs the true Faythe, he maketh the affliction of the fore Fathers, an instruction of their posterytye. O how greate is Gods care ouer vs: he examineth them

For we finde by experience that whosoeuer suffereth, though he suffer for his offence is pityed, and naturally miserye, though deserued, cannot but breede remorse, & tendernesse in the beholders. But now when such men as be of innocente behauioure, of vertuous conuersation, learned and graue persons, shall with comforte offer themselues to extremytye, reioyce when they are tormented, smile when they are dismembred, and goe to death as they would to a bancket: When such as neyther want dignityes to withdraw them, nor frendes and familye to pulle them backe, nor powerable enemyes to affrighte them, shall be readye to change theire dignitye with disgrace, to forsake their friendes, and geue thē

                  Noscenda res est, et virtus penitus scrutāda, visceribus. Nec enim leuis est ista quaecunque confessio, propter quā homo patitur & mori posse. It is a thing

worthye to be knowen and some vertue that deserueth deepe consideration for which a man is content to suffer death. They wante no meanes to searche out the trueth, hauing both read & heard, that which can be sayd on eyther syde. They wante not witt and iudgemente to discerne the good from the bad, being persons knowen to be of deepe insight and discretion. They can haue no pleasure in paynes, nor anye temporall allurement to moue them to vndertake so greate miserye, yea they haue manye delyghtes, honours, and prefermentes, to withdrawe them from it, and with altering opiniō, and speaking a word, mighte easylye anoyde it. Sure therfore it is, that they fynd it necessarye to doe this, and that their soule lyeth vppon it, or else fleshe and bloode coulde neuer disgest so heauy calamities. And though other, as worldlye wise, doe the contrarye, yet maye we easilye conceyue, that pleasure, profitt, and vanitye, with draweth the most parte of men, which here haue no place,
                     Matt. 7.
                   and narrowe is the waye, that leadeth to lyfe, and but fewe they be that finde it.
                     Luc. 13.
                   And this is the

comforte of those that suffer, that their death rayseth manye from death, and their patience maketh euery one inquisitiue of their religiō. Quisquis enim sayth Tertullian,
                  
                     Tertull. ad scapulā.
                   
                  tantam tolerantiam spectās aliquo scrupulo percussus, et inquirere accēditur quid sit in causa, & vbi cognouerit veritatem, & ipse statim sequitur. And agayne Exquisitior quaeque iniquitas vestra, illecebra est magis sectae. For euery one seinge such cōstancie is cast in some scruple, and waxeth inquisityue, what quarell we mayntain, and when he knoweth the truthe, he strayte embraceth it, and euerye most exquisite iniquity of yours agaynst vs, is a greater allurement of others to our religion. For as one that breaketh open the Iewellers cheste, by breakinge an iron locke, discouereth to those that are presente a multitude of most precious iewels, which being once seene, euerye one is desyrous to consider more at leysure the workemanship, glorye, and valew of the same: and manye vppon the sighte moued to buye them, which if they had bene still vnder locke, no man would haue regarded: So the persecutoures, by breaking the worthlesse

lockes of martyrs bodyes, laye open their fayth and vertue to the sighte of the worlde, of which men fallinge into deeper consideration, and debatinge with themselues the grace, and perfection, that appeereth therin, are moued to buye thē, though it be with losse of all theire landes, libertyes, and lyues. O wonderfull force of the Catholicke faythe, which aboue all natural course, and beyonde all reache of mans vnderstandinge, increaseth by that meanes, by which all other things are suppressed. We haue no other way to roote out wyckednesse, sinne, and impyetye, no meanes to abolishe lewde behauioure, and disorder amonge men, but onlye vyolence of tormentes, and cruell punyshmentes. And we see, though sensuality, and pleasure, intyse them with vehemente incentyues, yet the feare of seuere chastisemente, maketh them bridle their affections, and if anye be executed for greate enormityes, when he is dead, his sinne dyeth with him, and syldome leaueth he any posteritye, that by his deathe, is not rather dismayed, then incouraged to folowe hys euill

example. But in this quarell of oure Faythe, it happeneth quite contrarye, For as good slypp beinge ingraffed in a soure tree, bringeth forth neuerthelesse sweete fruite, agreable to the owne kinde, and the sapp of the same roote, which in the crabb is soure, and bitter, in the aple of the slypp, is most pleasāt, and delightsome, & though it be lothsome in the one, it allureth in the other: So hapneth it to Gods Saynctes, beinge put in the persecutoures handes. For theyr odyous and vntolerable crueltye, breedeth when it is practised vppon malefactoures, terroure, feare, and horroure of the wicked fruites, for whiche they are punished: Yett in the faythfull, and vertuous, the same bitter tormentes practised vpon them, worke the pleasante and goodlye fruites of saluation, not onlye moste acceptable vnto God, but able to allure mens harts to taste of the same. And as a cunninge artificer, not onlye of Iuorye or golde, but of iron or clay, can frame a proportionable Image, & in a base mettall or moulde, shewe exquisyte skill: so the true childrē of the Catholike Church,

taught by Gods spiryte, shewe the perfection of their vertue, not onlye in ryches, and welth, but in neede and pouertye, and as well in the depth of myserye, and middest of paynes, as in the heyght of prosperitye and worldly pleasure. To this effecte may we vnderstand the promise of God made by Dauid to those that kepte themselues within the walles and boundes of Hierusalem, that is the Church. Who geueth snowe as wooll and spreadeth the miste as ashes. That is those tormentes which to the badd are snowe colde and vnprofitable, and able to quenche the naturall heate that men haue to folowe sinnfull examples, are wooll to the good that both in them & others encreaseth the warmthe of true faythe and vertue, and the rancke fogge of worldlye disgrace, whereby the fyre of heresye and sinne is extinguished as ashes to Gods seruantes, where in the fyre of true religion and perfecte charitye is preserued and strengthned.

Well maye it be called the tryumph of God, seeing it passeth all other tryumphes of men. The tryumphes of the Romans, were wonte to be solēnyzed, in glorious chariotts, drawn with Lyons, Elephants, or goodlye steedes, with applause of the people, with pleasant musicke, with a troup of captyues, with costlye arches, and suche other monumentes of victorye.

The banners of the foyled enemies, the ryche spoyles, and famous pryses, were caryed in syghte, and euerye thinge ordered, and sett forth, with pompe and maiestye. But who euer heard of a tryumphe, where the conqueroure was haled, and haryed vppon the grounde, with his handes and seete bounde, with reproche of the lookers on, with disgrace and infamye, where he him-selfe was captyue, his tryumphall arche the blocke, or the gallowes, his enemyes banners, the axe or the corde, his spoyles and pryses his vnbodyed bowels, & dismembred limmes, fynally his pomp, punishmēt & his maiestly miserye. This tryumphe is not that, which worldlings affecte, neither can they conceiue, how torments, & tryumphes can agree together. And therfore did S. Hierome well call it, the tryumphe of God. In this tryumphe was Nabuchonosor and Paule captyues, and Iustinus confesseth him-selfe, to haue bene conuerted by the constancye of martyrs. Of this tryumphe speaketh S. Cyprian when he sayeth.

So greate is the force of martyrdome, that therby euen he, is forced to beleene with thee, that was readye to kill thee. But to proue this, though for the present disgracefull, yet in the sequell, a more gloryous tryumph, euen heare on earth, then euer anye the Romans had; Lett vs consider the gloryous shewes ther be to sett it forth. The martyrs for their tryumphall charyots, haue most sūptuous and statlye Churches; For the applause of the people, the prayers and prayses of al true Christians; For their musycke, the solemne quires; and instrumentes, vsuall in the Church; For their triumphall arches, most riche shrynes, and altars; For the banners of theyr foyled enemyes, the Armes and honours of Prynces, conuerted by their meanes; For theyr captyues, Kinges, Emperoures, and Monarches; For their spoyles and pryses, the Empyre, Kingdomes, & common wealthes. Finallye, for their pompe, the reuerend maiestye of the Catholike Churche. Loe now whether our tryumphe, though base in the eye, be not in effecte most gloryous, and whether

any conqueroures euer wann more, by killinge others, then the martirs haue done by being killed themselues. Quid infirmius Sayth S. Cyprian quā vinciri, dam nari,

What argueth more impotencye, then to be bounde, cōdemned, whipped, tormēted, killed, and to laye the head on the blocke at the hange-mans pleasure? This sighte, somtyme stirreth mercye, euen in the moste cruell tyrantes. But when at the martyrs tombes disseases are cured, the diuels rore, the monarches tremble, miracles are wrought, Idols fall doune: then appeereth it howe forcible the blood of martirs is. While the golde is yet mingled with earth in the mines, men treade it vnder foote as they dyd the earth, But when it is tryed with the fyre, & depured by the artyficers hand, Kinges them selues thinke it a greate

honour to weare it on theire heades: and so the martyres while they were alyue, enwrapped in that masse of earth, I meane their corruptible bodyes: they were contemned and troaden on, as the refuse of the world. but when their golde was seuered from drosse, that is their soule from their body by vyolent death in Gods cause: ther is no Catholycke Prynce so hautye, but that with bowed knee, and stooping head is readye to adore them, and accounte their very ashes, as cheefe ornamētes of hys crowne, and succoures of his realme. They are not therfore subdued that ouercome their enemyes, yea and theyr victorye is moste gloryous, for the vnusuall manner.

distilleth from it a most sweete liquour, wheras in the seconde, bothe the leafe is lesse lykesome, and the water lost. So fareth it with Gods Martyres. Whyle they lyue, they are sweete in their vertuous conuersation, If they dye, their example for a tyme doth some good, but put them in pryson, keepe them from worldlye comfortes, yea scorche them, burne them, and vse them in all extremitye, then doe theire vertue geue the best sauoure, and their bloode whersoeuer it is shedd, engendereth a wonderfull alteratiō in mens māners, makinge them embrace the trueth and become Christi bonus odor & incensū dignū in odorē suauitatis.

O how fayre is a chaste generation with bryghtenesse, whyle it is present men doe imitate it, and longe after it, when it is departed, and tryumpheth crouned with perpetuall glorye, winning the rewardes of theyre vndefyled encounters. Personable men of comelye feature, though they be by sicknesse or dirte disfigured, yet keepe they the tokens of seemelynesse: yea and then, theyr seemlynesse is most seene, when it is compared with some contrarye deformitye. And so is it in Gods Martyres, euen in the depthe of worldlye disgrace, doe they shew the glorious grace, and beautye of theyre mynde, and when theyre vertue encountereth with the persecutors vyce, then doth it shyne brightest, and is vnto the behoulders most pleasinge and amyable. O vnspeakable force of the bloode of Martyrs, then most powrable, when it is spilte, and then moste victorious, when it is troadden vnder foote.

Our inward man is quickned by Gods spiryte, clensed by the water of Baptisme, redemed with the blood of Christ. But nether wold this spirite haue quickned, nor the water washed, vnlesse the blood had redemed. The Spirit soweth, the water rypeneth, the blood reapeth. The spirite appeared in Christes baptisme, & though the heauē was opened, yet nether earth nor hell gaue any signe of his comming. The water was shed, whē Christe weeped at Lazarus raysinge, & though hell was enforced, to render her praye, yet neither heauen nor earth were moued at it. But when the blood came out of Christes woundes, bothe the heauens denyed lyghte, the earthe quaked, and hell deliuered vppe the deade, and then was it fulfilled, si

partlye in watrye humours, but chieflye in blood. Yet those are by natural course, tokens of lyfe, while in the bodye they performe theyr seuerall effectes. But for our present consideration, it importeth more to consider, that theyr spirituall value, and force, is shewed, when the bodye is bereaued of them. No man was moued, by seeinge Christe drawe breath, but when with a greate voyce, hee gaue vpp his spirite, and loste his breath, then dyd the Centurion strayte crye,

But so soone as by the wound in his syde, they founde passage, to come out, there issued also with them, a fountayne of grace, where of all the Sacramentes take theire effecte.

Iames also it is written, that in Spayne he could in his lyfe conuerte but eyght persons: But when his blood began to worke, the whole contrye yelded to his dead bones, and reliques, that regarded so lytle the force of his lyuinge speeches. So lyke-wise the Citie of Rome, though by S. Peter & S. Paules owne voyces, Epistles, and conuersation, they had bene laboured vnto the trueth; yet it neuer could be throughly conuerted, vntil it was longe soaked in Martyrs bloode.

                   of Christ it is sayde, Ascendet quasi radix de terra sitienti, he shall come vpp like a roote out of a thirsting grounde, and yet of him it is also written, erumpet in germen & faciet fructum,
                  
                     Ezech. 17
                   it shall breake out into a budd, and shall bring forth fruit. Who semeth more lyke a withered roote in a drie and barren soyle,

thē the Martyrs, that are pestered in prisōs, & as it were buried in miseries; & yet frō this roote, who seeth not how many budds of vertues, and fruites of gayned soules continuallye springe? Of Christ it is sayde, we haue seene him, and there was no comelynesse in him, yea we tooke him for a leaper, & the basest of all other men, and yet we desyred him. And how fitlye agreeth this to Martyrs, whose tortured bodies & opprobrious deathes, if you cōsider, there are none more abiect, and deformed, then they: But for all this, not anye disfiguring or outward vnhappyenesse could so preuayle, but that they are, & euer shalbe, desired, honored, and highlye esteemed.
                     Ibidem
                   Of Christ it is sayde, if he yelde his soule to death he shall see a long aged seede and I will geue him verye many, & he shall diuide the spoyles of the stronge. And is not this also veryfied in Martyres, whose bloode is seede, whose death reuyueth, whose plucking vpp, is the plantinge of theyre posteritye? Was not Abel the first figure of Christ, and he a Martyr? Was not Ioseph a principall paterne of Christes passion, and he sett to sale, and an innocent prisoner? Were

not all the sacrifices of beastes & birds, types and shadowes of Christes oblation, & none of them without shedding of blood? how perfectly therfore doth Martyrs resemble theyr Captayne, seeinge these figures and types, that foreshewed him, maye also be aptely applyed vnto them? But to procede to their other prerogatiues, there are but three especiall poyntes, wherin the dead can be honoured, by those that be alyue. First by monumentes and worthye me moryals erected for theyre renoune. Secondlye by famous wryters to register theyre actes. Thirdlye by being reuerēced & generally esteemed to be of soueraygne great power. And as cōcerning the first poynte, though the Emprerours and men of marke, emongest the Gentiles, haue had dyuers honourable memoryes: Yet were they for the most part of theyr owne or others buildinge before they dyed, or if it were after theyre decease, it was rather to flatter some of their suruiuing frendes, thē for anye greate care, that they had of the dead partyes glorye. And howbeit to the false gods in token of duty, there

haue bene set vpp most sumptuous temples, longe after theyre deathes: Yet with the memory of that wherin they were beneficial to the common wealth, there was also sett forth to be honoured in them theyr brutishe and vnnaturall wickednesse, which did geue to reasonable persons of good iudgemente, more cause to abhorre them for theyr lewdenesse, then to honoure them for theyre vertues. So was it a common thing to sett forthe the rapes of Iupiter, the adultryes of Venus, the lasciuiousnes of Apollo, & such lyke & to haue thē paynted in the verye aultars and prospectes of their temples. but for Martyrs, the monumentes are so generally raysed in dyuerse countryes, that it can not be deemed flatterye, and of them nothing but good either hath or could be sett forthe whiche they euer wolde haue reckoned in theyre vertues, or turned to theyre glorye. If Potentates & greate personages, haue had suche remembrances, it is no greate maruayle, seeinge they were mightye in power, they had ryche and wealthye posterity, which as well for theyr owne aduauncement, as for the goodwil to the deade,

were contented to renoune theyr houses and familyes with such stately workes. But a wonderful thinge it is, that common yea abiecte and base persons, suche as in theyr lyfe were counted the reuersion and refuse of the worlde, such as had neyther friendes nor posteritye to shewe them anye lyke fauoure, yea suche as dyed with infamye and dyshonoure, deuoured by beastes, and not thought worthye of so mcuh as a place of buryall in the earthe: that such men (I saye) sholde after theyr deathes, be honoured with sūptuous Churches, altars and daylye solemnityes, and not onlye in the place where they conuersed, but in dyuers distant nations, and countryes, where they were neuer knowen before their departure, it is a thing wherof as there can be no naturall reasone, so surelye muste it needes be construed a testimonye of Gods myghtye hande to honoure his Saynctes.

This dyd Saynte Chrisostome obserue when he saide Christe when he was deade, drew the whole world to worship him. And why speake I of Christe, when he caused his verye disciples after theyre

decease, to be gloryous. Yea and what speake I of his Disciples, for not so muche but theyre places, theyre Sepulchers and theyre dayes hath he made to be celebrated with perpetuall memory. Shew me thē the Tombe of Alexander, name the day wherin he ended his lyfe. But neither of them is notorious. They are now destroyed and quite abolyshed. But the Sepulchers of Christes seruantes are famous, aduaunced and honoured, in the Imperyall citye, and theyre dayes commonlye knowen to the worlde, bringing with them a festiuall comforte. And as for Alexanders Tombe, not his owne neyghboures knowe it, but these of the Saynctes, euē the Paynims can tell of. And the sepulchers of a crucyfied mans disciples are more gloryous, then kinges pallaces, not onlye in the hugenesse and statelynesse of the buildinges (for in this also they exceed thē) but that which is more in concourse and resorte of suppliants. Theodoretus also hath the like sayinge The Churches of Martyrs are glorious to be sene,

Now as concerninge the writers, that haue regestred the Martyrs actes, they surpasse all former Potentates of the Gentiles, for how manye Emperoures, haue you, that haue had Emperoures to write theyre worthye exploytes? how fewe, vnlesse they were men of base callinge, had theyre equales or betters to register theyre fame? Wheras to the Martyres other now as famous, for miracles, & holynesse of lyfe, as they were for their martyrdome, and as muche honoured euery waye, as they in the whole world, haue ben the croniclers & penners of theyre prayses. How manye Martyres doth S. Cyprian S. Basill S. Chrisostome S. Hierome S. Ambrose S. Augustine S. Bernarde and others honoure in theyr Sermons and workes? All, men as gloryous thēselues in Gods Church as they

of whome they sett forth the prayses. I omitt Eusebius S. Beede, Florus, Metaphrastes, Vsuardus, and infinite other graue authors. For what bookes haue you almost written by a Christiā, where in if the matter beare it, there is not mention made of Gods Martyrs? Yea how manye of the verye Gentiles haue regestred their memoryes? of whome thoughe they conceyued not as they sholde, yet speake they of them to their owne confusion, and theyre glorye. Now as touching the thirde poynte, whiche is the reuerente and worthye opinion, that true Christians haue of the power of Martyrs, it were to longe to recyte the perticular testimonyes of antiquitye. For though we doe not (as the heretickes groslye father vppon vs) yelde them anye diuine honoure, or take them for Gods; yet they haue ben euer more highlye esteemed of our fore fathers, as also they are by vs, for theyr wonderfull power. And firste if what theyr power is in heauē, be gathered by that which they had in earth, we haue great cause to put cōfidence therin. If S. Peters shadow, S. Paules hādkerchers, &

girdeles, were able to cure diseases; If S. Paules prayer in the shippe was able to obtayne the lyues of two hundred seuentye sixe persons; If S. Steeuens prayer, was so forcible for his persecutours, as to conuerte a cheefe agente in his death; Why maye we not with S. Hierome inferr,

When they were yet mortall (sayeth S. Bernard) & sure to dye, they seemed to haue commandement ouer lyfe and death, putting to death the quicke, and raysinge from deathe the deade, and that with theyre onlye worde. How much more mighty are they now, when they are aduanced to suche vnspeakable honoure, and theyr princedome is most assuredlye established?

are they in heauen, whose power was so great euen here on earthe? Secondlye if we consider the might of the diuels, what stronge effectes they haue wrought, as by the inchaunters of Pharao, the sodayne destruction of Iobs cattel, the murderinge of his children by ouerthrowing their house, & other wonderful effectes, that God hath permitted vnto them; Muche more power must we presume to be in Gods Saints, whome we are sure he wolde not make inferiour in might vnto his enemyes in heauen, ouer whom he gaue them so greate authoritye here in earth. And for this hath it bene alwayes a custome in the Church to goe on pilgrimage to Martyrs Tombes, where they haue alwayes shewed theyr patronage to such, as come vnto them for succour. Of this S.

We maye aunswere, that the Martyrs in their tombes extoll his mercye, who by theire verye ashes cureth diseases, and releeueth manye miseryes. In perdition, by the losse of theyr lyues &

shedding of theyr blood, they confirme and geue testimonye vnto his truethe.

                     The vnhappyness of the schismatickes and lapsed & comfortes against their example
                   credite tēporall authority, or such worldly respects, forsake these so glorious & diuine honours, & purchase a most lamētable & ignominious stile. For what are they but cōtrary to that which S. Basill sayth of Martyrs, the spoyle of Christiās, the destroyers of mens soules, the occasioners of our cares, hinderers of our prayers, factours of the diuell, cloudes of darkenesse, weedes of the Church, and fortresses of heresye. What are they but ruynes of relygyō, dismembred offales and lymmes of Sathan. Manye of them yeldinge before the battayle, and foyled

before they foughte, haue not lefte them-selues so muche as this excuse, to saye that they went to church vnwillingly. They offer them selves voluntarylye, they runne wittinglye to theyre owne ruine, and seeme rather to imbrace a thing before desired, then to yeelde to an occasion that they wolde fayne haue eschewed. And did not your feete stumble, your eyes dasele, your hart quake, & your body tremble, whē you came into the polluted Sinagoge? And could Christes seruant abyde in that place to do anye reuerence and renounce Christe, or to doe anye homage to his enemy whom he had in baptisme renounced? And could you come thether to offer your prayers vnto God, where your verye presence offered you bodye and soule to the diuell? And could catholicke eares sustayn without glowing, the blasphemous, reprocheful, & rayling speaches against your true mother the Catholicke Churche? Was it no payne to heare the corrupte trāslations, abuses and falsifyings of Gods owne worde? Was not the lawe of, goinge to churche, and of beinge there

present at that which they call diuine seruice, made and published purposelye to the abolyshinge of the Catholique Faythe, to the contempte, reproofe, and ouerthrow of the true Churche, to the establishing of theyre vntrue doctrine? And can any Catholicke knowing this, (as none can be ignorant therof) imagyne, but that in obeyinge this lawe he consenteth vnto it, and to the accomplyshing of that, which the lawe intendeth, that is the impugning of the true & the setting vpp of a false faythe. Doe you not remēber S. Paules wordes They are worthy of death not onlye that doe suche thinges,

                  but also those that consente to such as doe them? Euen as he is worthye to be punyshed, who though in mynde he fauoure his Prince, yet in deede he cleaueth to his enemye. Moreouer was not thys lawe made, to force men to shewe and professe a conformablenesse in external behauiour to this new faith? Is it not required as a signe of renouncinge the true church, and approuinge this newe forme of seruice, sacraments, and religion? To denye thys, is against experience. For to this effecte sound al

the penall lawes and statutes, this doe the examinations, araygnemēts & executions, make manyfeste, wherein still the thinges punished, and condemned are, not goinge to the diuine seruice as they call it, the hearing masse, the receyuing Priestes, vsinge the benefitt of theyr function, or acknowledginge of the authorytye of the Sea Apostolicke. In all whiche, what can we thincke is meante, but that theyre lawes, and all theyre indeuoures tende to make vs denye oure, and receyue theyre beliefe. And therefore when we obey them in these poyntes, what doe we but that which they pretende att our handes? For if a subiect should make a lawe, that al the estates of the Realme shold leaue the obedience of theyre true Queene, and only submit them selues vnto him: And shold prescribe that in token therof they all sholde come to his Pallace, and attende there, whyle his seruantes did Pryncelye and regall homage vnto him; were not the obeying of this lawe a consente to his rebellion? And the presence at his Pallace a sufficyente sygne of oure reuolte from oure Soueraygne?

Or doe we thinke, that by forsakinge oure Queene, thoughe it were for feare of her aduersarye, we dyd not enough of our partes, to sulfill the mynde of his lawe, whiche was to drawe all fom her, to attende vppon himselfe: that therby shee being destitute of adherentes, he might dispose of her, and of her kingdome at his owne plea
                     •
                  ure? Is not this our very case? The Queene is the Catholicke Church. The rebellious subiecte, resembleth the enemyes therof. The lawe commaunding from the Queenes, and forcinge to her rebels obedience, are the penall lawes terrifyinge vs from the Catholycke relygion, and enforcinge vs to the heretycal seruice. The comminge to his Pallace whyle he is honoured as Kynge, is lyke the comminge to Church while heresye is sett forthe, as true religion. Now therfore is not the obeyinge the lawe of comming to theyr seruice, whether it be for feare, or loue, a sufficient sygne of our reuolte from our Queene that is the Catholyke Churche? And doe we not as muche on oure sydes, as is sufficient to fulfil her enemies desire,

and intente? which is the forsakynge the open profession of dutye and seruice due vnto her, and the attendance vppon her enemyes pleasure, that none being lefte that dare openlye withstand them, & defend her, they maye worke her ouerthrow the better. Surely if in a temporall cause, this point shold come to the scanning of any seculer tribunal, the leaste faulte that the offēders could be condemned of, were highe treason. And how much greater treason thinke we it is against Christe, to cooperate so directly to the ouerthrow of his Churche, which is not onlye his kingdome, but his mistycal bodye, and he not onlye the Soueraygne, but the heade therof; Whose iniuryes he accoūteth as offered to himselfe, as he well shewed sayinge to S. Paule once a persecutour of it Saule Saule why doest thou persecute me? Nether can your protestatiō or other signe excuse you, for you are both in mans reason, and Gods censure, more to be iudged touchinge your minde, by your deedes, then by your wordes. And therfore if your deede be an establishing of theyr lawe, and consequently an actual

denial of your faythe, your wordes excuse you no more, then they should doe hym, that offering incense to an Idole by commandemēt of his Prince, should saye that in mynde and harte, he were a Christian, though all the world might see that he plaied the Infidel. For where the action it selfe is contrarye to the faythe whiche in wordes is professed, a mans wordes doe onlye argue, that eyther he is an Atheist, that careth not for religion;

Doe you not confesse, that there was in the enacters of it Ecclesiasticall and suficiente power, to commaunde or bynde you in spirituall actions, and those such, as only and

wholye tende to the confirmation of false doctrine, and subuersion of the trueth? And who seeth not that this is as muche in effecte as if you sayde, the lawe that commaundeth goinge to churche with heretickes is iuste, and temporall Magistrates haue spirituall authorytye, sufficient to binde in conscience to goe to theyre erroneous seruice, notwithstanding that they doe it to establish misbeliefe, and race out the Catholicke religion. And to saye that goinge to churche at suche tymes as theyre seruice and sacramentes are mynistred, theyre doctrine preached, or the rites of theyre secte practised, is not a spiritual, but a ciuile action, is against all sense and reason; seeinge that it is the verye principall signe of spirituall dutye, to be presente at suche thinges, wherby religion is chiefelye professed: especiallye when this presence is commaunded by a lawe, the knowen meaning wherof is to force men to a profession of a false beliefe.

You maye lykewise in the same volume see the counsel of Melancthon, Peter Martyr, Bucer, and the Ministers of the Tigurine Congregation, whose censure being by Caluine demanded, they all agreed to his opinion.

the same assertiō. And albeit their reasons were misapplyed in the particular churche, to which they proued it vnlawfull to resorte: Yet are they very sufficient and forcible to confirme that the repayring to a false church in deed, is moste sinnfull and damnable.

An other woman hauinge committed the lyke cryme, was sodaynlye in the bathes seased on by an euill spirite, and toare of her tongue with her owne teeth, by whiche she had renounced her faythe. And thus being made the reuenger of her own offence,

within a litle space extremelye tormented with wringinge in her bowels, she gaue vp the ghost. And to omitt perticulers; Harken what S. Cyprian sayeth of those,
                     Ibidem
                   that in his tyme were guilty of this reuolte. Quam multi quotidie immū
                     dis spiritibus adimplentur? quam multi vsque ad insaniam mentis excordes, dementiae furore quatiūtur? Nec necesse est ire per exitus singulorū, cū per orbis multiformes ruinas tam delictorum paena sit varia, quam delinquentium multitudo numerosa. How manye are euerye daye fraught with foule fiendes? howe manye waxinge witlesse fooles, are in the ende shaken with a furious madnesse? Nether neede I to goe ouer the particuler endes of euery one, seeing that in the manyfold ruines and reuoltes through the worlde, the punishmentes of theyre sinnes are as various, as the multitude of offenders is greate. Let euery one of you cōsider as well, what he himselfe hath deserued, as what others haue suffered. Lett no man flatter himselfe in the adiourning of his chastisement. Yea lett him rather feare the more, seeinge God reserueth his sinne to an eternall reuenge. Be not

moued with theyre example, that eyther throughe retchlesse errour, or dulnesse of faith runne headlonge forward in theyre wilful blindenesse. Goe not you to perdition with them for companye, and thinke it not better to goe to hell with manye, then to heauen with a few. Ioyne your prayers with oures, that daylye praye for you. Be not slack in your owne cause, to which so manye cooperate, and laughe not you in your miserye, which so manye rue. God is readye agayne to receyue you. He openeth vnto you the gate of his mercye. He calleth you, he enuiteth you, with fatherlye pitye. O vngratfulnesse, why stycke you? why stande you? what stayeth you from cōming? Your soule lyeth vppon it; youre eternall weale or woe is in the ballaunce. Take mercye whyle you may, enter whyle you haue accesse. Leste the gate be shut, and your knocking not harde, and your last aunswere, nescio vos, I knowe you not. And you on the other syde moste constant confessours,
                     Comfortes agaynst Sersma tickes example
                   continue youre course, perseuer in youre commenced enterprise. Lett not the example of those that fall,

make you the weaker.

Lett no man imagin that the good goe out of the Churche. The winde carieth not away the wheat, neither doth the storme ouerthrow the trees that are strong rooted. The lighte chaffe is tossed with euery tēpest, & the weake trees with euery blast are blowē doune. And as the piller in a building, if it stande so ryghte as it sholde; the more wayghte is layde vppon it, the

more firme and vnmoueable it standeth; but if it leane to eyther syde, any wayght maketh it fall quite doune and breake a sunder: so those that in this spirituall building of the Church walke vprightlye, framing theyre behauiour agreeablye to the integritye of theyre fayth; by the poyse of persecution, are rather strengthned and confirmed: but suche as are of loose demeanoure, and euill lyfe, leaninge to the lybertye of this wycked tyme; with euerye lytle wayght of aduersitye, fall into schisme, and are broaken of from the members of Christes misticall bodye. When the Sunne shyneth sayeth S. Augustine,

                   Though you see some Saule of a prophet to become a prophets persecutour: some Iudas of Christs Apostle to become his betrayer:
                     Apoc 2

                  quam qui peruerse agens, nomen vel ordinem sanctitatis habet. Delinquentem namque hunc redarguere nullus praesumit: & in exemplis culpa vehementius ostenditur, quando pro reuerentia ordinis peccator honoratur. No man in the Church doth more harme, then he that liuinge peruerselye beareth the name and degree of pyetye. For such a one no man presumeth to reproue, and a greate deale more apparentlye turneth the faulte to euill example, when for reuerēce of the order the offender muste haue his honoure. Better therfore it is that they should goe out of it, that within it are a disgrace vnto it, and without it honoure it, as a grounde that can not brooke such rancke and poysoned weedes. Contemne not the perle because the swyne treade vppon it: despyse not the lyghte, because the euill doers hate it: thincke not worse of the Churche if

the wicked forsake it. It were a follye in the Aegiptians to contemne theyre riuer Nilus that fatteth theyre soyle, and causeth all theyre aboundance: to refuse to eate of the fruites which by wateringe the earthe it engendreth, because there-in the Crocodyle breedeth, or for that some times it casteth out an vglye Vyper. So were it muche more madnesse to condemne the Churche, or Sacramentes ther

                  of, because some poysened wormes haue bredd and fedd in them, and afterwarde impiouslye reuolted from them. It is not muche to see some cockle in Gods fielde, so longe as the enemye maye sowe it.

                   The nett is not yet drawen to shore for the fysher to caste out the euill fyshe. The good man of the house hathe not yet sorted his vessels,

though some of the bad seuer them selues from Christs body: we must rather thincke it a happynesse, then a nouelty. For so hath it ben alwayes heretofore, and so will it be alwayes hereafter, vntill suche tyme as venient Angeli & separabunt malos de medio iustorum.
                  
                     Matt: 19
                   The Angels shall come and seuer the bad from emongest the iuste, and alott euerye one to his deserued home. It is better for vs to be humbled with the meeke,
                     Pro: 16
                   then to diuide spoyles with the proud. Better it is to be a wounded and tormented member in the bodye, then a member clad in golde and cutt of frō the same. It were greate follye in one, that seeing a horse fayre to the eye, of a good coloure, of a proper make, and sett forthe with a gorgeous furniture; would strayte bye it at an vnreasonable pryce, neyther considering the pase, corage, force, or soundenesse therof: So were it extreme madnesse, to buye the aduauncement of this world, with losse of eternall ioye, only for the fayre shew and flattering delyghtes, not wayinge the slyppernesse, the vanitye, and the daunger of them. If they thinke worldlye

pleasure so great felicitye, as to take it at this rate with the losse of theyre soules: yett lett not vs imitate or lyke of theyr bargayne. Though childrē seeinge the stage players, in costlye attyre, thinke them happyer then the rich gentleman, that goethe playne, because neyther consider they the players base condition, otherwise, nor theyre shamfull profession, but onlye theyre fayned glorye: yet lett not vs be so chyldishe, as to make the lyke accounte of the worldlye glouttons, that haue reuolted from God to gorge, knowing that though they are cladd in purple, and euerye daye pampered with magnifical banckets, yet ende they with this miserable conclusion, mortuus est diues, & sepultus in inferno.

mounting is only to his greater ruine? Such felicitye is much lyke theirs, that hauinge taken the poysened iuyce of certayne hearbes, are by the operation therof, brought to dye with excessyue laughture. And what felicitye is it, sayeth S. Chrysostome,

was heresye, so theyre death desperation. Eusebius writeth that the Cataphrigians beinge driuen to an exigent,

To whome Apollinaris well aunswered, that so had the Marcionistes and other heretyckes done, but, quae (sayeth he) esse poterit apud eos, martirij veritas, vbi Christiveritas non est? Howe is it possible for thē to haue the trueth of martirdome, that wante the trueth of Christe. The Manna when it was vsed agreeablye to the precept of God, had all kinde of delightsome tastes, was fitt to norish & verye pleasante to eate. But when in the vse therof his comaundement was not obserued, that most comfortable viand rotted, and turned into wormes. So though martirdome, if it be well vsed, be an acte of singuler vertue, yea of all vertues together, and turne to the incomparable glorye of the Martyre: yet when it is not taken for a right cause, and in a due sorte, it is to the sufferer but a beginning of an eternall corruption, and breedeth an euerlastinge worme of conscience. And vppon such

alighteth that curse of God mētioned in Deuteronomie,

And so what torturing so euer the wicked or heretickes suffer, it shall auayle them to nothinge but to theyre payne. For if all were Martyres, that dye for theyre relygion, then manye heresyes both contrary emong themselues, and repugnant to the euident, doctrine of Christ, sholde be truethes, which is impossible.

Haue we not the same furious spirite, likewyse in the Anabaptists, who though they denye the scripture, the humanitye of Christe, though they stycke onlye to theyre owne dreames,

and reuelations, though they permitt suche brutishe cōmunitye and pluralytye of wiues, and mariage of sister and brother together: Yet dye they in defence of these damnable Paradoxes, & that with such pertinacye, as thoughe they had bodyes of steele, that felte no payne or tormente. But lett not this moue anye one to thinke the trueth on theyre syde. For euen to this daye doe the Iewes dye in defence of the fables of theyre Talmud, (which is to them as oure Byble is to vs.) Wherein notwithstanding besydes the denyall of the coming of Christ, ther are very many ridiculous things. As that God spendeth three houres in the daye in readinge theyre lawe: other certayne houres he weepeth and afflicteth himselfe for sufferinge the Temple to be destroyed, & the Iewes brought into bondage: that he appoynted certayne sacrifyces euery newe Moone to be offred for his sinne in geuing the Sunne that lyght which wrongfullye he had taken awaye from the Moone; and other fables of lyke follye. And yet as childish thinges as these be, wante there not at this daye, that

will dye in defence of theyre religion. And not many yeares since, a Renegate Christian becōming a Iewe, was burnt for this fonde doctrine. Neyther is this maruayle when the Gentyles themselues euen vnto this daye, haue also their Martyres. For as maye be seene in the Epistles & storyes of India, it is thought a verye laudable thinge amonge them, putting themselues and theyre goodes into an vnfurnished shipp newe builte for that purpose, to bore the shipp thoroughe, and by drowning in the syghte of theyr friendes and the people, to sacryfice themselues to theyr false Gods. Other also in theyre greate and hyghe solemnities, when the presse & throng of people is moste, vse to lye flatt in the thresholdes of the dores of the Temples, and suffer them selues, to be trampled to death, & are therby accoūted as Sainctes. I omitt Decius, Scaeuola, Leocorius, Leonides, and others of older date, whose factes maye easilye auouch S. Augustines sayinge,

But the true Martyrs are those of whome our Lorde sayde, blessed are they that suffer persecution for iustice sake; Wherfore not they that for theire owne iniquitye, or for the impious breache of Christiā vnity, but they which for righteousnes suffer persecution, are in deede the true Martyrs.

                  et memoria eorum in benedictione est: and theire memorye shalbe blessed. But not all Arrius posteritye, not all the races of other heretickes, coulde mainteyne theyr doctrine, or theire Martyrs credite longe, but euen it fell out with them, and will doe with foxes Martyrs,
                     Psa: 36
                   as Dauide prophesied. Vidi impium superexaltatum, & eleuatum supra Cedros Libani. & transii, & ecce non erat. & quaesiui eum et non est inuentus Locus eius, For a whyle they were honored as Saintes, and had the glorye of the Cedars of Libanus giuen vnto thē. But in the ende they are found to haue bene barren trees, and throwne into

vnquencheable fyre, and theyre places was no longer found amongest Saints. Martyrdome can not be the iuste punishment of sinne, but the crowne of vertue; and whosoeuer is iustlye executed for a true offence, Sainte he maye be, if he repente him of his faulte, and take his deathe as his iust deserte; But Martyre he can not be, thoughe he endure neuer so manye deathes or tormentes. For as one that in a hott sommer daye walkinge in a drye and barren fielde, and being sore parched with the sunne, & extreme thirstye, though he settled him selfe to paynte or graue in the earth most pleasante fountaynes or delyghtsome and shadowye bowers, shoulde be neuerthelesse as much annoyed with heate, and as litle eased of his thyrst as before: So they that walke in the fruitelesse fielde of heresye, in which it is vnpossible that eyther the fountayne of grace shoulde spring, or the arbours of glorye growe, howsoeuer in the heate of theire iust persecution and thyrst of comforte in theyre punishmentes they feede theyre imagination with a vayne presumption of future

ioyes: yett in trueth all their hope is like a paynted fountayne, that rather increseth, thē diminisheth their payne. And therfore in yelding them selues so rashelye to tormentes for theire heresyes, they doe lyke a poore wretch lyinge a sleepe on the edge of a hye and steepe rocke, who dreaminge that he were made a Kinge, and had a glorious trayne of nobilitye to attende him, sūptuous pallaces to lodge him, and the commodityes of a whole kingdome at his commandement: shoulde vpon the sodeyne by starting vp and leaping for ioye, fall downe from the rocke, and in lieu of all his imaginarye solaces, kill him selfe and leese that litle comforte which he had in his miserable lyfe. For in trueth as S. Paule sayeth, though I deliuer my bodye to be burned, and haue no charitye and vnion with God, and his true Church: it auayleth me no thinge. And for this woulde Christe haue his first Martyres Innocentes, and as S. Cyprian sayeth,
                     Cypr. ep: 24
                   
                  Aetas nec dum habilis ad pugnam, idonea extitit ad coronam; & vt appareret innocentes esse, qui propter Christum necantur, infantia innocens ob nomen

eius occisa est. The age vnhable to the combate was apte for the crowne, and that it myghte appeare that they were innocentes that shoulde dye for Christ, innocent infancye was firste for his name putt to death.
This seemed Dauide to insinuate when he sayd,
                     Psa: 36
                  
                   keepe innocencye and beholde equitye, because there are reliques for the peaceable man.
But where this innocencye wanteth, this equity fayleth, this peace ablenesse with Gods Church is not obserued, well sayeth S. Cyprian:
                     Cypr ep: 16
                   
                  Siex talibus quis fuerit apprehensus: non est quod sibi quasi in confessione nominis blandiatur, cum constet, si eiusmodi extra ecclesiam fuerint occisi fidei coronam non esse, sed paenam perfidiae. If anye such be apprehended, he need not flatter him selfe, as though he were a confessor of Christes name: seeinge it is manifeste that if anye such be killed, it is no crowne of his faythe, but a penalty of his faythlessnesse. And therefore if anye of theire actions be committed to writinge, it is not a reporte of theire prayses but a rehersall of theire iniquities. For as Dauid foretolde. Perijt memoria eorum cum sonitu;

               WHich how great it is, may easelye be coniectured. For theyre deade bodyes, here in earthe are so highlye honoured and had in suche estimation; what maye we thincke of the maiestye of theyre soules in heauen. For first all the comfortes, ioyes, and delightes that are here scattered in diuers creatures, and contryes all the bewtye and comlynesse that any worldlye thinge here hath, shalbe there vnited and ioyned together in euerye Sayncte, without any of these imperfections,

wher-withal they are here coped. Nowe what a happye man woulde we thinke him, that with a worde mighte haue all the wealth and treasure, solace and comfort that this worlde is able to afforde: If he might be loued of whom and as much as he wolde: honoured of all: and partner of euerye mans ioye, as much as them selues: and haue euerye thing in what tyme place and manner, that it pleased him to appoynte? We see how muche anye one pleasure is prysed. Some will venture to anye perill, to please theyre taste: other to contente theyre eye: manye to satisfye theyre eare: infinite to fulfill theyre sensualitye. And yet what are all the content-mentes of these senses, but shadowes and dreames of delight, neyther sufficient to quenche sorowe, nor able to cotinue longe, nor wonne without hazarde, nor ended without feare, nor lost without greefe? But in heauen all the senses are euermore and without feare of losse, fullye satisfied, with theyre seuerall pleasures, and drowned in the depth of vnspeakeable delighte. The place how glorious it is maye be

ghessed by the description of S. Ihon of heauenlye Hierusalem,
                  
                     Apoc. 28
                   whose walles are of pretious stone, whose gates Pearles, whose porters Angels, whose streetes paued with golde, and interlaced with Christal riuers, the banckes wherof are sett with the trees of lyfe, whose fruite reneweth, & the leaues preserue from all kind of sicknesse. God is their Sunne and euer shineth: theyre temple, and is euer open: theyre daye neuer endeth, theyre felicitye neuer decayeth, and theyre state neuer altereth. Which description, though it be sett forthe with the most precious things of this world, the better to resemble the glorye of that place: yet in trueth it hathe litle comparison to the thinge it selfe. But because we beinge ruled by sense, more then by vnderstandinge, conceaue not spirituall matters, but by the similitude of earthlye thinges: Lett this for the glorye of the place suffyse, that all the ornaments, delightes, and inuentions, that eyther nature hathe bredd, or arte deuised, or man imagined, shall there meet to the furniture of these roomes. And whatsoeuer hath bene, is, or shalbe

of rare beautye to sett anye thinge forth, shall there be present, & all this in a thousande folde more delicious & exquisite maner, then euer hath bene seene or conceyued in this world. Now range with your inwarde eye in the suptuous Pallaces, and statelye buildinges of monarches, & Emperours, see what you can, and thincke a thousand times more then you see, it is all but a fancye in respecte of that which heauen is garnished withall. Now for your companye you must not thincke that because the lame, blynde, poore, and despised abiectes of this worlde are those that goe to heauen, and on the other syde the Princes, peeres, and Potentates for the most part those that sinke into hel: that therfore all the beste companye is banished from thence, and the remissals of mankinde, onlye lefte; to fill vpp the seates of the falne Aungels. For firste, all those of al states, and degrees, whose companye shalbe grateful, shalbe there present: but suche as were vnworthye of theyre earthlye prefermentes, and abused them to theyre damnation, as moste doe: Muche lesse are they worthye

of heauenlye glorye, and theyre companye we shall vtterlye deteste, & therfore neuer be troubled with it. Secondlye if God of a childe that cometh naked out of his mothers wombe and hath no more to healpe him selfe, then the poorest bratt that is borne in the worlde, can make, such mightye Emperours, and worthyes as we reade to haue ben in tymes paste: how much more able is he to aduaunce the moste impotent wretch to a greater dignitye in heauē. God estemeth not the toyes that men accounte of, his iudgemente onlye searcheth euerye mans desertes. When we dye, it is, as in the change of a Prince: for they that were in authoritye, are then deposed: those that were base and abiect before are then aduaunced: and the Prince that is newly created, regardeth litle whome his predecessoure fauoured, but who seemed to him beste worthye of prefermente. Euen so little esteemethe God what accompte the worlde hathe made of vs, but howe well we haue deserued to be well thought of and worthelye rewarded. Besydes men, we shall haue

the companye of so manye quires of Angels, of our Ladye, Christe, and the moste blessed Trinitye, and these so beautifull to see, so amiable and louing to conuerse with, that we shall no lesse ioye of oure companye, then of oure owne glorye.
                     Anselm. ep. 2 ad Hugonem.
                   Of this S. Anselme speaketh thus. Whosoeuer deserueth to come thither, whatsoeuer he wold wish shalbe, and what he will not, shall not be neyther in heauen nor earthe. For such is the loue of God to his Sainctes and of them amonge themselues; that all loue one another, as them selues, & loue God more then them selues. And none will haue but what god will haue, and that whiche one will haue, all wil haue, and that which one or al wil haue God, also will haue it so to be. So that euery ons wishe shalbe fulfilled in hym selfe, in all other creatures, yea and in almightye God. And so shall all be absolute Kinges, because euerye ons pleasure, and will shalbe fullye accomplished. Finallye, in the syghte of God we shall haue the fulnesse of felicity, which neither eye hath seene, nor eare heard, nor mans harte atchiued. The vnderstanding

shalbe without erroure, the memorye without forgetfulnesse, the will without euill desyres; the thoughtes pure, and comfortable, the affections ordinate, and measurable, all the passions gouerned by reason, and setled in a perfecte calme. No feare shall affrighte vs, no presumption puffe vs vpp, no loue disquiete vs, no anger incense vs, noe enuye gnawe vs, no pusillanimitye qualye vs, but courage, constancye, charitye, peace, and securitye, shall replenishe and establishe our hartes. It shall be lawefull to loue whatsoeuer we lyke, and whatsoeuer we loue we shall perfectlye enioy, and not onlye loue, but be also loued, so much as we our selues will desire. Our knowledge shall comprise, whatsoeuer maye be to our comforte, not only one thing at once, but all thinges together, so that the multitud of the obiects shal delight vs, not cōfound vs, fill our desire of knowledge, not hinder the perfect intelligence of thē all. And for our bodyes, they shalbe of most comely & gracious feature, bewteous and louely, healthful without al weaknes, alwais in

youth flower and prime of theyr force, personable of shape, as nimble as oure thought, subiect to noe penall impression, vncapable of greefe, as cleere as christall, as brighte as the Sunne, and as able to finde passage thorough heauen, earth, or any other material stopp, as in the liquid and yeldinge ayre. Our syghte shall feede on the most glorious and eysome maiestye of the place, and on the glorye and bewtye of the company: the eare shall alwayes be solaced with moste sweete and angelicall harmonye: the smellinge delighted with heauenlye sentes and odours: the taste pleased with incomparable sweetnesse: the feelinge satisfyed with a perpetuall and vnknowen pleasure: Fynallye euerye parcell, ioynte, senew, vayne and member of our bodye, shall haue his seuerall and peculiar delyghte. Whiche though they be most diuers in qualitie, and so vehement, that the least of them in respecte of the excessyue ioye that it wolde cause in vs, were more then our mortall bodye would beare: yet shall not the presence of the one, diminishe the full comfort of the other, but euery

one increase others pleasure, and we neuerthelesse haue a seuerall contentmente bothe of euerye one by it selfe, and of them all together. Theyre plentye cloyeth not, theyre satietye offendeth not, the continuance annoyeth not. Theyre hunger is satisfied yet not diminished, their desyre accomplished but not ceased, so that by hauinge theyr desyre, theyre mynde is quieted, and by desyring that they haue, ānoyance auoyded. Neyther is theyre ioye conteyned in theyre owne persons. For as Hugo sayeth,

                     •
                  ort to euerye Sayncte, as his owne peculier. And because all loue God more then themselues, they take more pleasure of his blisse, then of all theyr ioyes beside. O how gloryous wil it then be for gods Martyres, when in securitye they shall counte theyre conquestes of Sathan, & his instrumentes, by patience and constancye?

when they shall haue an eternall tryumphe, for a shorte victorye? when they shall looke down vpon their glorious spoyles of soules, by theyre blood conuerted, and shall see theyre enemyes eyther confounded, by Gods iustice, or reclaymed by his mercye? What a singuler ioye shall they cōceyue by considering the tormentes auoyded which the lapsed shall endure and the glorious change that they fynd in them selues? For theyre prison they shal haue a paradyse of delights: for theyr cheynes, ornamentes of glorye: for theyre reproche and shame, honoure and reuerence: for the raylinge againste them, euerlasting prayse & titles of renoune: frō the rage of enemyes they shall passe to the league of Saynctes. O how gloryous will the scarres of theyre woundes, and the tokens of theyre agonyes then shewe,

Non enim deformitas in eis, sed dignitas erit: & quaedam, quamuis in corpore, non corporis, sed virtutis pulchritudo fulgebit. For there shalbe in them no deformitye, but dignitye: & a certayne beautye shall shine,

wherof we see that Christe the paterne of our resurrection, did beare with him into heauen the printes of his wounds, as S.

O sinner, securelye mayest thou come to the father where thou haste the mother before the sonne, the sonne before his father. The sonne sheweth his father his syde and his woundes, the mother to her sonne her breste and her dugges, neyther can there be anye repulse, where there pleade so manye markes and tokens of charitye. O howe terrible will these woundes of Christe be, to the Sinagoge, when that shall be veryfyed in the daye of dome, videbunt in quem transfixerunt?

O how comfortable to all Saynctes, but especiallye to Martyrs, who shall not onlye reioyce in them, as assurances of theyre saluation, certyfycates of Christes loue towardes them, and pledges of perpetuitye in blisse: but also in that they thēselues are scarred in like manner, and haue a more particuler resemblance of that glorye. They also with theyr wounds shall terrify their tormentours: and euerye strype and hurte that they haue receyued, shalbe so ineuitable an accuser and witnesse of theyre persecutoures impyetye, that they would rather if they mighte hide theyr heades in hell fyre, then see those prints & stepps of theyr barbarous crueltye.

                   geueth vs notice how much more glorious they shalbe when they are raysed to theyre felicitye. Honoro, sayeth he, in carne martyris exceptas pro Christi nomine cicatrices: honoro viuentis memoriam perennitate virtutis: Honoro per confessionem Dei sacratos cineres: honoro in cineribus semina aeternitatis: honoro corpus quod mihi dominum ostendit diligere: quod me propter dominum mortem docuit non timere.

And why shold not the faythf

                  l honour that body, which the very diuels doe reuerēce: and which though they afflicted in tormentes yet they glorifye in the tombe? I honoure therfore that bodye whiche Christe hath honoured by the sworde, and which with Christe shall raygne in heauen. By which wordes we maye gather how honourable these scarres wilbe in heauen, that deserue so much honoure here in earth: how glorious the reuyued bodye, when the dead ashes therof are of suche pryce: how highe a grouth of all happynesse, will be in the Saynct; when the seedes of eternity springe so high in his only duste: What a whetstone he wil-bee of the loue of Christe: what a comforte to them that contemned deathe for Christe: howe muche honoured of other Saynctes:

what a terroure to the diuels: finallye how highlye esteemed of God in his glorye: seeinge that all these prerogatyues are so forciblelye expressed euen in his deade bones and reliques. And this is the effect of that especiall croune peculier & proper vnto Martyrs which is nothing else,
                     Aureola martyrum.
                   but a singuler comfort and contentmente of mynde expressed in particular sygnes of glorye in the bodye, for hauing suffered constantlye death in defence of the faythe. And although the like croune by the Diuines and Fathers called Aureola, be also a priuiledge of virgins and Doctors: Yet as the combat of martyrdome is more vyolent, harde, and victorious, then that of Virgins, against the rebellions of the fleshe, or of the Doctours against the diuels subteltyes, where with he endeuoureth to subuerte soules: So hath the crowne of Martyrs a preeminence before them bothe. Finallye, how vnspeakeable the rewarde of Martyrs is, maye be gathered by the manner of Christes speach. Who assygning in all other beatitudes a particular rewarde, he limited the guerdon of Martyrs to

no certayne ioye, but sayde in general. Merces vestra copiosa est in coelis.
                  
                     Matt. 5
                   Your rewarde is verye greate in heauen; to shewe the aboundante fulnesse of theyr felicitye. Neyther must we thinke them onlye to atchyue this triumphe, who by apparent vyolence, by woundes or effusion of blood conclude theyr lyfe: but all they, though neuer so vnknowē, whose dayes by imprysonment, banishment, or anye other oppression are in defence of the Catholike Faythe abridged. For we haue example in S. Marcellus who beinge condemned to keepe beastes, and put to extreme drudgerye, after manye yeares spent in that vnsauery office, departed without any other forcible vyolence, and yet hathe bene alwayes esteemed a Martyre & for such a one is honoured of the Church.

                  quoties metimur a vobis, semen est sanguis Christianorum. Our number increaseth so often as you reape vs, and seed is the blood of Christiās. The more the children of Israell were oppressed, the more they were increased, and so is it in Catholikes as S. Augustine sayeth Resurrectio immortalitatis pullulabat faecundius,

Oure Palmes with wayght growe hygher, our flame with suppressinge waxeth the whotter, and oure spyce by poundinge yeldeth the better sente. When you persecute vs, you till and manure the ground of the Church: & thincking to roote out her corne, you doe but sowe seed that will spring with a more plentifull haruest. You thinke it is the Seminarye prieste that enlargeth the Catholike Faythe: wheras indeede youre selues make the chiefe Seminarye, of which Catholikes doe growe, accordinge to that sayinge of S. Hierome: Sanguis martyrum seminarium ecclesiarum. The Pope & his Bishops make them Priestes, but you are they

that make them Seminaries. Thoughe theyre voyce doe somewhat, yett alas in comparisone it dothe but litle. Vox sanguinis fratrum vestrorum clamat de terra.

                   The voyce of the bloode of youre murthered brethren cryeth out of the earth, against you: And this voyce is it that so forciblye worketh. They saye that which bookes can teache them, but as Tertullian sayeth non tantos inueniunt verba discipulos; quantos Christiani, factis docendo. Theyre wordes fynde not so manye disciples, as Christians do teachinge by theyre deedes. Oure constancye forceth men to looke more into our cause, and then by seeking they fynde, by fynding they beleeue, & beleeuing are as readye to dye as we our selues. Our prisons preach, our punishmentes conuerte, our deade quarters and bones confounde youre heresye: You haue laboured to suppresse vs this 29. yeares: and yet of our ashes spring others,

Newe slyppes are euer engrafted when the olde bow is cutt of, and the vertue of the roote that the bough leaseth the slypp enioyeth. You cut open our fruite and shed the cornel on the earthe, where for one that you spoyle, many will springe vpp of it. We are the wheate of Christe as S. Ignatus sayde: and are readye if you will to be ground with the teeth of wilde beasts, or if you wil not offer that, with the milstones of your heauye persecution, that we may become pure and cleane bread in the syghte of Chryste. The Crosse is our inherytance, as S. Ambrose saythe, and there-fore if you bringe vs to the Crosse, or which is all one in effecte to the gallowes; we maye saye with S. Andrew. O bona crux, accipe me ab hominibus, et redde me magistro meo, vt per te me recipiat, qui per te me redemit. O good Cross take me from men and restore me to my maister, that by thee he may receiue me, who by thee hathe redeemed me. For in this quarrell,

Beinge soldiers by professiō, we are glad, that we haue so iuste occasion to fyghte in defence of the trueth: and yet hartelie sorye to see you bidd vs battayle by impugninge and persecutinge the same. How-soeuer it goe with vs, we are sure of the victorye, who if we haue the vpper hande, we haue wonne Satan, and chased him out of his haunt to the confusion of heresye: and yf we be oppressed and murdered for oure faythe, then winne we a heauenlye reward to oure selues, and a confyrmation of oure relygion to oure posterytye. Where-fore small is the hurte that you doe vnto vs, ye vnspeakeable the benefytt.

Yet is this the extreme folly of all persecutours, who thinke it necessarye for

theyre peace, fyrste to impouerishe, spoyle, and tormente Gods seruantes, and by barbarouslye martyring them, to sende them to heauen, there to be continuall soliciters with God for reuenge against theyre murderers.

Doe but consider euen at this presente the wonderful straites into which your

                  Antiochus President vnder Aurelian, whyle S. Agapitus was in martyring, cryinge that he burned within, sodaynly gaue vpp the ghost. Flaccus the Prefect after the martrydome of Gregorye Byshoppe of Spoleto, stroken by an Angell did vomit out his intrailes. Dioscorus, S. Barbaraes Father, was burnt vpp with fire from heauen, for his butcherye towardes his daughter for her faythe. That nyghte wherin S. Chrisostome was exiled, the Citye of Constantinople and especiallye that parte, where the Emperours Pallace stoode, was so shaken with an earthequake, that they were glad to call him backe agayne. When Valens the Arrian Emperoure would haue chased the Catholikes out of the same Citye, there fell suche a hayle of stones, that it had lyke to haue destroyed it. I omitt the horrible endes of Antiochus, Herode, &

                  Iulianus Apostata, of which the fyrst two were eaten vpp with vermin: the other being stroken miraculously with an arrowe from heauen, the earth opened & breakinge out with fyery flames swallowed him quicke into hell, as S. Gregorye Nazianzen writeth. Wherfore consider you also that persecute Catholiks in Englande, how easye it is for God to practise the lyke punish-mentes vppon you, as the examples of some haue sufficientlye already geuen you warning. Remember the sodayne and horrible deathe of one Yonge an Apostata and Pourswivaunt who pursuing a Catholike at Lambeth fell doune on the sodayne, ere he could laye handes on him that he persecuted and foming at the mouthe presentlye dyed. Remember Iustyce Bromlye whoe after he condemned in Wales a Catholike Schoolmaster called Richard White, became soone after bethered and childish, and neuer sat in Iudgement synce, but remayneth still in that impotente takinge. The Iurye also that went vppon him after a while dyed eyther all or the most parte: And the clarke of the Assyse was so strooken

in his eyes that he could not reade the endytement. Consyder the deathe of Norton your rackmaister who vppon his death bed in desperat maner cryed out, that he was racked more cruellye then euer he racked any: to omitt that which to his sonne and his wyfe befell to the more apparent reuenge of hys crueltye. Consyder the accidente, that befell to Blythe a man of speciall authority in the councel of Yorke: who when a Prieste comminge to the barre made the signe of the Crosse spake in derision therof very vnreuerent wordes, & with in a fewe howers fallinge downe a large payer of stayers in the presidents house lyued not manye dayes after. Remember the iuste reuenge of God agaynste Cheeke and Hurlestone the cheefe agents in the apprehension, cōdemnation, & executiō of M. Inglebye Prieste, & notorious enemyes of Catholikes; of which the fyrst suruiued not longe after; and the seconde goinge to speake with the Bishope at his house without Yorke, & hauing sente one in to aduertyse hym of his cōming when the messenger returned was found dead & with so vntolerable

a sauour, that the verye ground where he laye as it is crediblye reported retayned the stench, and they were fayne to drawe him awaye with longe ropes at a boates tayle in the riuer, not being able to indure him in the boate for the extreme bad sent that came frō him. I omitt Iudge Alephe who sitting to keepe the place when the other Iudges retyred, while the Iurye consulted aboute the condemnation of Father Campian and his companye, pullinge of his gloue founde all his hande and hys seale of Armes bloodye without anye token of range pricking or hurte: and being dismayed therwith because with wipinge it went not a waye but still returned, he shewed it to the Gentle men that sat before him, who can be witnesses of it till this daye, and haue some of them vppon theyr faythes and credites auouched it to be true: Yea and he him selfe soone after by deathe was cutt of frō so bloodilie occupying that roome anye longer. I omitt the straunge and sodayne deathes of the chiefe knightes & gentlemen in Deuon shiere, who presently vpon their cruell & vniuste handelinge

& producing certayne Catholike straūgers by Gods Iustice soone dyed & to the terrour of others were appayed with theyre due reuenge. I omit the wonderful stay and standing of the Thames the same day that Father Campian and his companye were martyred to the great maruayle of the Cittizens and maryners. I omit the lyke staye of the ryuer Trente about the same tyme. Which accidents though some will impute to other causes yet happening at such speciall times when so open & vnnaturall iniustice was dōne they cānot be but interpreted as tokens of Gods indignation. For doe not thincke but that he hath as much care of his seruantes nowe as in former Ages he had, he is as much enemy to wickednesse now, as then he was: and no lesse able to reuenge that whiche he mislyketh, then heretofore he hath bene, as the rehearsed exāples maye geue you proofe. We speake not this in waye of daring; For as Tertullian sayde to Scapula, non vos terremus, qui nec timemus, sed velimus vt omnes saluos facere possimus, monendo mi theoma chin. We fright you not, for we feare you

not. But our desire is to helpe all to saluation, and to warne them not to bid God battayle. The Priestes and Catholickes whome you persecute, are stones that God throweth at you to make you by theyre example and exhortation, to leaue feedinge vppon the carryon of sinne and heresye. But you like enraged houndes breake your teeth vppon the stone, not considering the hande that threw it. But as for vs, our countes are caste, and oure reckoninge knowne, & this only I speake to warne you of your erroure. If God suffer you while you breake your owne teeth to worow also vs, & to butcher our bodyes: we know he dothe it not for our harme. But S. Chrisostome well sayeth that as the cunning artificer to abetter an image doth first melte and disolue it;
                     Chrisost. in idde dormientibus nolo ve

                   to cast it afterwarde in a more perfecte moulde: So God permitteth oure fleshe by you to be mangled, to make it more glorious in the seconde casting. And as a cunninge imbroderer hauinge a peece of torne or fretted veluet for his ground, so contryueth and draweth his worke, that the fretted places being wroughte

ouer with curious knottes or flowers, they farr excel in shew the other whole partes of the veluet: So God being to worke vpon the groūde of our bodyes, by you so rente & dismembred, will couer the ruptures, breaches, & wounds, which you haue made, with so vnspeakable glory, that the whole partes which you lefte shalbe highlye beautifyed by them. And as the paperer of olde rottē shreddes, often times gathered out of vncleane dunghils, by his industrie maketh so fyne, white, and cleane paper, that it is apte to receyue anye curious drawinge, paynting, or limminge: so oure scattered partes by you cast in to dunghils, he will restore to suche puritye & perfection, that they shalbe more capable of his glorious ornamentes, then they were before. And this is that which Saint Paule sayd: Reformabit corpus humilitatis nostrae configuratum corpori clari tatis suae: He shall reforme the body of our humility confygured vnto the bodye of his brightnesse. Whiche phrase of speache argueth, that the more the body for him is humbled in torments, the more shall yt be partaker of hys

brightnesse in glorye. Farre otherwyse will it be in the bodyes of the wicked here pampered in all kind of pryd. For as the haukes though while they are alyue they are highlye prysed, deyntilye fedd, and honoured vppon greate persons fistes: Yet whē they are once dead theyre bodye serueth for nothinge but to be throwen in to the dunghill; wheras the Partridge whose fleshe hath bene torne with the haukes talons, is notwithstanding serued in a syluer plate to the Kinges owne table: so the wicked in this lyfe cheryshed with all kinde of solaces and set forth with great pompe after theyre deathe are onlye fytt for hell fyre: wheras the bodyes of Gods Martyrs, shall both in earth haue theyr honour often times by open myracles, and in heauē be preferred to the Kings table not to be eaten them selues; but to feede vppon the repaste of Angels. Cease therfore to abuse and contenme that God esteemeth: cease to pursue whom God defēdeth: & heare his gentle warninges, leste he power vpon you more vntolerable scourges. He beginneth to geue a taste of his anger alredy. And

Alas, why should you vse these extremityes against vs? why should you pyne and waste vs, with such lingering torments? we saye with S. Cyprian Eyther to be a catholike is a capital crime or no. If it be, we acknowledge that this fault we haue, and will neuer forsake it. Why then doe you not forth with put vs to death for it? If it be no such fault: why do you persecute innocents, & put to death, torments, & ryson the vndeseruing. Tormenting is for those that acknowledge not the accusatiō: but we doe not onlye not denye or conceale our Faythe, from you; but are readye if you will to preach it in your most publike assēblyes. And if that all those were to suffer for oure Fayth, that in deed beleeue it to be the best: I will not only say as Tertulliā
                   did to Scapula of Carthage Quid passura est Carthago decimāda a te? What shall Carthage suffer beinge to be

tithed by the? But quid passura est Anglia tertianda a vobis? what shall Englande suffer, being to be thirded by your crueltye. Quid te,
                  
                     Ep ad Demotrium.
                   sayeth S. Cyprian to a persecutour ad infirmitatem corporis vertis? quid cum tenerae carnis imbecillitate contendis? Cum animi vigore congredere, virtutem men tis infringe, fidem destrue, disputatione, si potes, vince, vince ratione. Whye doest thou turne thee to the fraylty of our bodyes? why stryuest thou with the weaknesse of our fleshe? Encounter with the force of our minde; impugne the stoutnesse of oure reasonable portion; disproue oure faythe; ouer come vs by disputation if thou canst, ouercome vs by reason. This is not the waye in christian charity. You should firste sufficientlye enforme vs of the truth, by putting vs to silence, and conuincing of errour the learned of our syde: before you proceede to punishing of vs, for not embracinge it. We haue reade your bookes, we fynde them full of wilful corruptions, bothe of Scriptures and Fathers, purposlye wrested agaynst the true meaninge therof. Pryuate conference is to small purpose, for it commonly endeth

in only raylinge agaynst vs. The waye of Gods churche hath alwayes in suche cases bene, to geue free lybertye to the verye heretickes, to haue publike disputation before sufficyente Iudges, and if they were there conuicted or refused to come, they haue bene subiecte and that worthelye to temporall punishmente. But hitherto could we neuer haue anye equall conditions of disputation graū
                  ted. Vnlesse, it be equall for a man to be brought from the racke to dispute. And yet that very disputatiō was so litle to the aduauntage of your cause, that manye of your beleefe were since that the lesse friendes to your faythe, and others became altogether Catholikes. But if you will needes kepe on your violent course againste vs, and prolonge your iniquitye: we will saye Dominus nobis adiutor,

                  non timebimus, quid faciat nobis homo. Our Lorde is our ayder, and we will not feare what man can doe vnto vs. The Martyrs in S. Cyprians tyme disgested the lyke miseryes with ioyful hartes,

                   sayinge: Hostes veritatis non tantum nō perhorrescimus, sed prouocamus: Inimicos Dei hoc ipso quod non cessimus, vicimus:

& nefarias contra veritatem leges, subegimus: & sinōdum sanguinem nostrum fudimus, sed fudisse parati sumus. We are not, onlye out of feare of the enemyes of trueth, but we chalenge them: In not yelding to Gods aduersaryes, we haue ouercome them, and mastered theyre wycked lawes agaynste the truethe: thoughe as yet we haue not shed oure bloode, but are prepared if neede require at anye tyme to shedd it. If you shew vs worldly honours, therby to entyse vs vnto you: you shewe the Lyon haye, for which he careth not. If you threatē vs with torments, therby to enforce vs: you shew the Salamandra fyre, with which she is not harmed. For neyther can youre pleasures profitt vs, nor your punishmentes hurte vs, and therfore equallye we contemne them bothe. The worste you can doe vnto vs in oure beste; though temporallye you oppresse vs, you cannot hinder our spirituall aduauncement: though you spoyle vs of oure worldlye goodes, you cannot bereaue vs of oure heauenlye in heritaunce: and how heauilye soeuer you affryghte vs, you shal neuer be able

to suppresse oure religion. Though the vpper heauens violentlye turne the lower from easte to weste, yet haue they theyr peculier and proper course from weste to easte. Aud well maye you vse vyolence to oure bodyes, to remoue vs from the easte of Gods Church, where the Sunne of trueth ryseth, to the west of heresye, wher the lyght therof goeth downe: but God willing your vyolence shall neuer make vs leaue oure naturall motion, from the errour of all false doctrine to the easte of true religion. If God will permitt you, we refuse not to endure and stay his pleasure. If he will, he is able to healpe vs; if he will not, he will make vs able to sustayne you. If it please him the frogges, the gnattes, the flyes, the grashoppers, are armyes stronge enoughe to enforce you from molesting vs, as they dyd Pharao from molesting the people of Israel. But if he thinke it better for vs, to haue the number of oure brethren made vpp, before he reuenge oure iniuries; we will contente oure selues with his diuine apointmente. It were no delight to vs to see you in the miserye, that we our selues

desire to be ridd of. Your scorges could not auayle vs, we enuye not so muche youre prosperitye, as to desyre youre ouerthrow. To your hatred we render goodwill, for your punishments prayers & we would willingly purchase your saluations with oure deerest bloode. But how well so euer we be affected towardes you: take heede that the earth that receyueth oure bloode, crye not out againste you, agreeablye to that, The voyce of thy brothers bloode cryeth out of the earthe.

Vppon which S. Ambrose noteh: that God sayde not, it cryeth out of thy brothers bodye, but out of the earth. For though thy brother forgeue thee, yet the earth forgeueth the not. Though thy brother saye nothinge, the earth condemneth thee. That is against thee both a witnesse and a Iudge. A more earnest witnesse, that yet reeketh with the bloode of thy vnnaturall murder. A more seuere Iudge, that was defyled with so heinous a crime, as to open the mouth & receyue thy brothers blood at thy handes.Yet for our selues, we from our hartes forgeue youre iniuryes towardes vs, and

only pitie your abuse of Gods benefits, that you sholde offende him with his owne giftes, and for his fauoures towardes you persecute his flocke, & hinder the course of his religiō, yea endeuoure to abolishe the name of his Catholike Churche.

& farr more vnworthy of such funerall solēnyties.

                   alwayes remēbring with your selues that this light and momentary tribulation will worke in you an eternall poyse of glorye. And confirming your selues with these comfortable words siue viuimus,
                  
                     Rom: 14
                   
                  Domino viuimus siue morimur domino morimur, siue viuimus siue morimur Domini sumus. Whether we liue, vnto our Lord we liue: whether we dye, vnto our Lord we dye: whether we liue or dye, our Lordes we are.

                        enses
                   to conclude with S. Bernardes wordes, what now remayneth my deerest, but that you be warned of perseuerāce, which only deserueth renoume to the men, and rewarde to their vertues. For without perseuerance, neither getteth the champion the cōquest, nor the conquerour his crowne. The accomplishing of vertue, is the vertue of courage nurce to our meritts, & mediatrice to our meede. It is the sister of patiēce, the daughter of cōstancy, the louer of peace the knott of frendship, the bande of agreement, the bulwarke of godlinesse. Take away perseuerāce: no seruice hath any paye, no good turne anye thankes, no prowes anye prayse. In summe, not

who beginneth, but who perseuereth vnto the end he shalbe saued.
               
               
                  By one, that reuerenceth your prisons, beareth most dutiful affection to your persons, & humbly craueth parte in your prayers,
