In which Diſcourſe, is diuerſe curious hiſtories, ſome auncient Propheſies, and other matters, whereby moſt euidently appeareth: that he whom the Seigneurie of Venice hath held as priſoner for the ſpace of two yeres and twentie two dayes, is the right and true king of Portugall Dom Sebaſtian. More, a Letter that declareth, in what maner he was ſet at libertie the IV. of December laſt. And beſide, how he parted from Venice and came to Florence. All firſt done in Spaniſh, then in French, and novv laſtly tranſlated into Engliſh.

            To the Reader.
            
               IN the end of the moneth of Auguſt laſt paſt (gentle Reader) I receiued a packet of Letters 
                  •
               n the Italian tongue, wherein one was written in fa
                  •••
                of the king of Portugal Dom Sebaſtian, who was as then ſaid to be priſoner in Venice. This letter was directed to the moſt Chriſtian king, and I caried it with all poſſible diligence I could vſe, and cauſed it to be deliuered to his Maieſtie. In the ſame packet there was alſo a further traduction of the ſame letter; which hauing thus happened to my hands, I acquainted diuerſe of my friends therewith, who made ſuch reckening and eſteeme thereof, as it were a matter beyond all other moſt rare and maruellous. This letter was of ſuch power, as it prouoked and kindled in the hearts of my ſaid friends, an extreme loue and affection towards the Prince, and begot in them likewiſe a vehement deſire, to ſee him in libertie and peaceable poſſeſſion of his kingdome, as if themſelues had bene ſubiects thereto belonging. So (referring that to ſuch as were more obliged by dutie, and had more particular intereſt in ſuch buſineſſe,) after the receipt of this leeter, I laboured all I might to vnderſtand ſome tydings of his eſtate and ſucceſſe. Hauing then learned, that a Religious man, of the order of the preaching Friers (named brother Ioſeph Texere a Portugueſe, one knowne to the greateſt and meaneſt in Europe, as alſo here very well) had writtē to this Citie to a Biſhop a friend of his, a diſcourſe of matters happening ſince the ſaid king began to enterpriſe his Affricke voyage: I ſo much importuned a nephew to the ſayd Biſhop, who kept this diſcourſe in his hands to ſend to his vncle, as no excuſes might ſerue from transferring it to mine. The reading thereof was to me ſo pleaſing and agreeable, as both it encouraged and cut off all ſuppoſition of labour, in the ſpeedie writing and copying it out. Hauing by this meanes this verſion in mine owne power, I thought I ſhould commit an inexcuſable fault, if I ſhould reſerue to my proper vſe ſuch a ſtrange accident and worthy regard. Hereupon attending

            The copie of a Letter, written by a Ʋenetian Gentleman to his moſt Chriſtian Maieſty, tranſlated out of Italian into French, and out of French into Engliſh.
            
               To the moſt Chriſtian King, Henry the fourth, King of Fraunce and Nauarre.
            
            
               THat great God, whoſe iudgements are alwayes diuerſe and contrary to ours, diſpoſeth and ordereth al things on earth by different meanes, not being comprehenſible to our capacities: and no body but himſelfe, can attaine to any certaine knowledge of their iſſues and effects. But as he is full of ſoueraigne goodneſſe, of infinite wiſedome, and admirable prouidence, he knowes how to draw good out of euill, exalting and raiſing vp thoſe things, which the ignorant world taxes in his imaginations with titles baſe and abiect. That this is moſt infallible, none knowes, or hath better approoued, then your moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie: whoſe enemies, bred and borne in your owne proper kingdome, being your liege people, vaſſals and ſubiects, accompanied with ſtrange and forreine aduerſaries, moſt vniuſtly trauerſing and perſecuting you, till you obtained that whereto God and nature had ordained you. Neuertheleſſe, by the aſſiſtance of the ſame God (albeit to further & effect the better their damnable intentions, they tooke the couerture and pretext of Religion) your Maieſtie did manage thoſe affaires with ſuch wiſedome and ſpeed, as entring into the whole and lawfull poſſeſſion of the kingdome, their owne eyes could witneſſe the vanitie of their pretences, and how ill ſhaped the cloke was that

And much more late had they bene in finding remedie, if your moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie (moued by your owne

                  •
               oth what I haue before & nowe againe ſay, that the iudgements

                  〈◊〉
                Portugal did. Whereby of diuerſe in this citie and other places

he hath bene knowne: for they accompanied in his voyage to Affricke, and had ſeene him in his kingdome: with whom diſcourſing, he put them in mind of ſundrie particulars which they had had as then together, and were impoſſible that any other but the King himſelfe ſhould know. Of all which particular notes, I moſt humbly intreat your Maieſtie to heare onely but two. There is a merchant here, who ſome fiue and twentie yeres ſince was wont to trade into Portugall: this man being at Lisbon before king Sebaſtian paſſed into Affrick: mark what befell him. As he was vpon the ſea ſhoare, ſtopping his ſhippe that had receiued a leake, he ſaw a farre off the King comming, making a goodly horſe wheron he rid, to mount and coruet very ſprightly vnder him: and he not knowing him to be the King: this beaſt (quoth he) what will he breake his owne necke? The King and others of the traine hearing theſe words, gallopped the horſe ſo mainely toward the merchant, and made him in ſuch a fearefull taking, as the poore man verily thought he ſhould looſe his life. But when he knew him to be the King, he fell to the ground, and weeping (on his knees) deſired pardon, for he feared leſt his lauiſh tongue might haue made him to be truſſed vp. The King as he was euer full of clemencie, commaunded him to ſtand vp, intreating him verie honorably, and beſtowing ſundrie fauours vpon him.
            
               Sebaſtian ſeeing the ſame merchant here in our citie, before he was arreſted as a priſoner, demaunded of him (vnasked) if he remembred ſuch a matter, and ſo acknowledging the one the other, diuerſe things paſſed betweene them which happened at that preſent occaſion.
            Moreouer, this King (I would ſay this priſoner) when he was at Meſſina, knowing that there dwelt a gentleman of a verie famous familie, who had accompanied him in his voyage to Affricke: he went and found out his houſe, and vpon ſome priuate paſſages betweene them, they kindly renewed their former acquaintance. Beſides, ſince his arriuall here in our citie, and before his impriſonment, he writ diuerſe letters to the ſaid gentleman, and receiued likewiſe letters backe againe from him. And by his expreſſe meanes, was a man and letters ſent into Portugall, to ſundrie faithfull Lords of that kingdome: but we heare that this man ſo ſent to Portugall, died in thoſe parts, but vnknowne how,

They will me that I ſhould anſwere (as one accuſed) to certaine demaunds ſet downe therein: which, in obedience to your worthie commaundement, I purpoſe to do, and for my better vnderſtanding, as alſo all others whatſoeuer, the demaunds ſhall be ſet downe in order following.
            
               The firſt demaund.
               For what cauſe the King of Portugall Dom Sebaſtian, without leauing any heire vnto his kingdome, would put his life in hazard of loſing, paſſing at the age of 24. yeares and a halfe into Affrick, a countrie of Infidels, and a land extreamely hot and vnfaithfull?
            
            
               The ſecond demaund.
               What iudgement I make of his life, whether he died in the battell, or ſaued himſelfe? And what I thinke of the bodie that was buried (as his) in the church of Bethlehem, a couent of Monkes of the order of Saint Ierome, a league from Lisbon, in the beginning of the yeare, 1583.
            
            
               
               The third demaund.
               Wherefore (being aliue) he would not diſcouer himſelfe? that he might be vſed like a King, and freed from ſo great miſerie, as is well knowne the ſlaues in Barbarie do endure?
            
            
               The fourth demaund.
               Where he hath bene all this long continuance of time? and how chance he came to Venice, & not to France or ſome other place: where (without doubt) he might haue receiued better entertainment, according as appertained to his condition? And whether, by my ſight of him, I know him aſſuredly?
            
            
               The fift demaund.
               What they were that procured his libertie? What further tidings I haue of him, and whether he determine to paſſe any further then this citie?
            
            
               The ſixt demaund.
               Admit that this priſoner be the ſame king of Portugall Dom Sebaſtian, and that by the helpe of God, fauour of his moſt chriſtian Maieſtie, as alſo other Princes and eſtates of Chriſtendome, the Seigneurie of Venice do ſo acknowledge him: what meanes and remedies hath he to recouer his kingdomes, and to reeſtabliſh himſelfe in the poſſeſſion of them?
            
            
               An anſwere to the firſt demand.
               For anſwer to the firſt demand, I ſay, that the principall cauſe which prouoked king Sebaſtian to paſſe into Affricke, was (as being a very chriſtian Prince, honorable and iuſt) his enflamed deſire to increaſe chriſtianitie, and to make the name of God knowne through the wide vniuerſe. And (as after he came to the yeares of diſcretion) he alwayes maintained and cheariſhed this 
                     •
                  ope: ſo ſuch an apt occaſion inſtantly offering it ſelfe, he did 
                     •
                  mbrace it with all affection. But worthy Lord, the better to giue notice of what I intend, I muſt deriue my courſe from higher 
                     •
                  nſtances, diſcourſing of the race and ſucceſſe of the later Barba

                  ian kings: to wit, Muley Mahamet Xarifa, and Muley Ma
                     
                        •
                     uco ſirnamed Abdelmelech (who would terme himſelfe the ſer
                  
                     •
                  ant of the moſt high) this the vncle, the other the nephew, yet both royall pretenders. Muley Mahamet (father to Muley Hamet the baſtard, now raigning in Barbary) had three legitimate ſonnes, Muley Abdela Xarifa, Muley Abdelmumen, and

                  Muley Abdelmelech, otherwiſe called Maluco, of whom we now are come to make mention. This was a very wiſe Prince, and of mighty valour, he ioyned to his owne inheritance all the kingdomes of Barbary, and them he diſcretly gouerned while he liued. At point of death, he named for principall heire his eldeſt ſonne Muley Abdela Xarifa: conditionally, that he ſhould giue to his two brothers part of his kingdomes. Muley Abdela ſucceeding thus his father, not onely denied to fulfill his commandement, but concluded vpon the death of his brethren. Who hearing thereof in the city of Miquines, where as then they kept, tooke counſell to withdraw themſelues into Turky: and ſo trauelling thence, after they had diſpatched ſome hindring difficulties, within a few dayes they arriued with their mother and ſiſter at Tremeſſen, a city of the Turkes. At the ſame time reigned in the kingdome of Fez, the onely ſonne to Muley Abdela Xarifa, named Muley Mahamet Xarifa, who by expreſſe charge ſent a man to Tremeſſen, and there he murthered Muley Abdelmumen, as he was at his prayers in the Temple: Muley Maluco then being at Conſtantinople, where then bare ſway the Sultan Selim. Muley Abdela aduertiſed of this murther (although himſelfe had before procured it) made ſhew as if it diſpleaſed him greatly, and (with chiding his ſonne) cauſed iuſtice afterward to be done on the murtherer. After ſome few yeares his houre of death approching, he left as his only heire the ſayd Muley Mahamet his ſonne, without making any mention of his brother Muley Maluco: who ſtill kept himſelfe at Conſtantinople, intending to requeſt ſuccour of the great Emperour.
               
                  Muley Maluco being certified of his brothers death, made ſuch meanes vnto the Sultan Amurath, who reigned then after the death of his father Sultan Selim, that he gaue him ten gallies for his paſſage to the realme of Argell or Argiere, and commandement to the king of that countrey, to leuie ſo many men as he could, and then to accompany him in his owne perſon, till he had ſeated him in the kingdomes and lands of Barbary. Muley Maluco hauing bene at Argiere, departed thence in company of the ſayd king, and with him three thouſand Turkiſh harquebuziers, all arriuing together at Tremeſſen, where with ten peeces of artillery and other munition, the inhabitants vnited their forces with

them. From thence he iourneyed with his power into Barbary, and there after diuerſe fightes with the king his nephew, he tooke poſſeſſion of Teza, which was yeelded to him without any reſiſtance. And proceeding onward, he came to Fez, where then was Muley Mahamet with thirty thouſand horſe, and ten thouſand harquebuziers: there was likewiſe an Andaluſian Colonnell, that came and ioyned eighteene hundreth Andaluſians with him. The ordinance on either ſide played very roughly, Muley Mahamets part did ſmall dammage, but Muley Malucos very much, diſcomfiting almoſt all his nephewes horſemen, and forcing them to a ſpeedy flight. On the other ſide, the foote (after diuerſe hote skirmiſhes) came to handy blowes, continuing the fight ſo long, and with ſuch fury, as darke night was faine to terminate the battell. Muley Mahamet beholding his troupes thus vanquiſhed, and conſidering it was beyond his ſtrength to make any further counter-quarrie againſt his vnckles forces, withdrew himſelfe into Morocco, and ſuch in his company as bare him beſt affection. His vnckle tooke the way to Fez, where he was honorably receiued, and few dayes after gaue free liberty to Bacha king of Argiere, to depart home againe with his men, wherof ſeuen hundreth remained there ſtill with him. Muley Maluco vnderſtanding that his nephew prepared to charge him with a freſh encounter, went thence to Miquines, where continuing his reſolution, within a while after the two armies began to ſhew themſelues neare to the towne of Halé, where the vnckle ouerthrew againe his nephew and his forces, which amounted to forty thouſand horſe, and ten thouſand harquebuziers Muley Mahamet ſeeing himſelfe flatly foyled in the field, and out of all hope of making head any more, fled to Morocco, whence he paſſed to the mountaines (called Montes Claros) and by this retraite, Muley Maluco made himſelfe ſole Lord of Barbary.
               
                  
                     By this hiſtorie is apparantly to be ſeene, with what ſmall helpe a man may game thoſe kingdomes whereto he hath any right. In like manner, and with much more eaſe, may king Sebaſtian recouer his: becauſe it appertaines to no other but him, for he is true Lord and King thereof.
                  
               
               
                  From the mountaines Muley Mahamet ſent his Embaſſadors to the king Dom Sebaſtian, and deſired ſuccour at his hands: making him ſuch large offers, as were very profitable, and greatly for the aduantage of Chriſtendome. He gaue him (as I haue learned from diuerſe credible perſons) all the ſhoares which he held on the Ocean ſea, and ſixe leagues into firme land, with the townes and cities thereto belonging: among which were the cities of Arzile, Saphin, & Larache, all very ſtrong places & of great importance. Some ſay that he gaue him the abounding Alcacarquibir, Tituan, and other places: more, he cauſed in the field a plaine deliuerie of Arzile to be made, by Cid Albequerin brother to his wife, who was the gouernour of the ſayd city. And granted him moreouer, that the faith of Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be preached in Barbarie, and full power to crowne himſelfe Emperour of Morocco.
               This was the reaſon that made the King Dom Sebaſtian lo
                     •
                  ke vp his crowne, which the Kings his predeceſſours, and himſelfe euen vntill that time, had openly worne. I ſaw that Crowne lockt vp into peeces of Artillerie, which were newly and purpoſely made for that voyage: in like maner I ſaw the Banners, Standards, and the ſhips vnder ſaile for that armie. And I know that the king Dom Sebaſtian tooke with him an vnkle of mine, my mothers brother, who was iudge of the Armories in the kingdomes of Portugall, to ſerue him as maiſter of thoſe ceremonies, which were to be vſed in the act of his coronation as Emperour.
               The king Dom Sebaſtian ſeeing ſo great offers (and being a Prince of the loftieſt enterpriſes, deſirous to winne honour, and ſuch reputation as ſhould wait on due merit) knowing what vertues conſiſted in himſelfe, accompanied with ſuch forces, couragious, feareleſſe, hardie, actiue, 
                     •
                  nd preſuming in himſelfe that he onely was borne to breake downe and ſquander the infidelles impieties: accepted the conditions that were made vnto him. And thus iuſtly deſerued the ſinnes of Portugall, that he ſhould put his perſon in daunger of loſſe, his kingdomes and Monarchie in the ballance as a pray to ſtrange nations. Hence may your worthineſſe gather, what you deſire to know out of the firſt demand.
            
            
               An anſwere to the ſecond demaund.
               I anſwere to the ſecond demaund negatiuely: that king Sebaſtian
                  
did not die in the battell, and that the body which was buried in Bethlehem was none of his. But before by manifeſt reaſons I approue my ſayings, let me intreate your ſacred fatherhood to vnderſtand, that when he began to make his preparation for this voyage, I was then a man of yeares, and in ſome authority (which admit as ſpoken betweene our ſelues, becauſe that which oftentimes contenteth friends, diſpleaſeth and raiſeth a repining nature in ſuch as are not ſo.) When he parted from Lisbone to paſſe into affricke, being the yeare 1578. and in the moneth of Iune, I was in the 35. yeare of mine age, and had the vſe of very honorable charges, gouerning ſome couents of mine order, and had preached in diuerſe places of Portugall, with applauſe and ſatiſfaction of mine auditors. The ſame yeare I was in Lent called from my couent at Santeren, where I then aboade, to Lisbone, by Dom Alphonſo de Chaſteaublan
                        •
                     
                   chiefe Almoner to the king, and Commiſſary generall of the Bull for the Croiſade, to preach in the townes of Esbernos, Borba, Villaricoſa, Landroal, Terena, Moncaras, Moran, Mora and Portel: and I was enrolled in the regiſter of them, who were appointed to accompany the king in his preſent voyage, which could not by my ſelfe be performed, becauſe my Prelates that had commaund ouer me, had conſigned me to the gouernement of the Couent of Santeren, which is the fourth of our order, and the chiefeſt in Portugall: becauſe the Priour there ruling, began to find himſelfe not well, and had accō
                  pliſhed his three yeares iuriſdiction, in which reſpect my Prelates prayed the king to pardon me, from bearing him company in his purpoſed voyage, and at their requeſts it was obtained. Thus I ſtayed at home (although againſt my will) in Portugal, without paſſing into Affricke. I hold the rather this kind of diſcourſing with your Lordſhip, becauſe you may the better perceiue, that I had yeares and authority (as before I declared) ſufficient to know great men, and what belonged to ſtate affaires. The king parted from Lisbone, taking with him about thirty religious perſons of my order (to whom he bare very kind affection, and repoſed truſt inough in them, for he vſed to call them his brethren.) One of their number was our Prouinciall of Portugal, who commanded the orders through all the gouernement of the kingdome, and as well in Europe as in Affricke, Aſia, and America, named brother

                  Iohn de Silue, graund-child or ſonne to the Gouernour of Portugal, brother to the Biſhop of the city called the Port of Portugall, and to Fernand de Silue, who at that very time was Embaſſador into Caſtile: brother Manuell de Boſa, brother Vincent Afonſeca, and other religious men of very good diſcent. There was alſo mine vnckle Manuell Texere, of whom I made mention in my firſt anſwere, a brother of mine likewiſe, called brother Diego Cardoſe de Mirande, that maried with a ſiſter of mine, and diuers others of my kindred. King Sebaſtian hauing ioyned with his army in Affricke, at the city of Arzile, and leauing Larache, was gone toward the city of Alcacarquibir: there in the field thereto belonging, he put his men in order the fourth of the moneth of Auguſt.
               When the heauy newes was brought to Portugal, and that I had intelligence therof: becauſe of the intreſt I had in the iourney, I was conſtrained to go to Lisbone, being fourteene leagues diſtant from Santeren, to vnderſtand whether they were true or no. Where arriuing the 25. of the ſayd moneth, I met with mine vnckle, who was the ſelfe ſame day returned from Affricke. He by commandement of the Generall of the army, that remained behind as Lieutenant generall for the king, had brought thither with him vnto Lisbone Cid Albequerin, and his nephew the young Xarifa, ſonne to his ſiſter and Muley Mahamet Xarifa, which young Xarifa is now a Chriſtian, and liues in Spaine, bearing the title of the Prince of Morocco, and is commander of the order of Saint Iames, a Prince of many excellent partes and ſingular hope. Being thus with mine vncle, he told me that king Sebaſtian withdrew himſelfe from the battell, embarqued in his Galliot, but for certaintie that he was aliue. If I would know any other newes, I ſhould go viſite Cid Albequerin: and he earneſtly intreated me that I would do him ſo much pleaſure, becauſe the ſayd Cid Albequerin would receiue great contentment by my ſight and knowledge, for on the way he had much talke with him of me. So I went to ſee Cid Albequerin, and after I had long conferred with him, I deſired him to do me ſo much kindneſſe, as to tell me what was become of Dom Sebastian. The firſt word that he gaue me, was deliuered with vehement expreſſion of griefe, being thus: He is not dead, and if he be, the God of the

Chriſtians is vniuſt. This he ſpake to me very ſprightly, and in perfect good Spaniſh, which he had the vſe of better then my ſelfe. Hereupon I intreated his Excellency to fauour me in ſuch ſort, as to tell me what he vnderſtood of the whole affairese, and prayed to be reſolued the rin from his owne mouth. He lifting his eyes vp to heauen, hauing the teares ready to drop downe his cheekes: O Ala (quoth he) which is as much as when we ſay, ô Lord: then hauing bene ſilent an indifferent while, he vſed theſe ſpeeches to me: Reuerend father, your fatherhood ſhall know, that although I am none of the oldeſt in the world, yet I haue bene ſeene in ſome battels, where I haue noted men of ſingular valour, and incomparable power: but I neuer ſaw ſo braue and generous a knight (whereat he fetcht a great ſigh) as the king Dom Sebaſtian. For he exce
                     ••
                  ed all the reſt, fighting in this ſad and diſaſtrous battell, and euer I was by his ſide: all the world would haue made him way, and by the behauiour of his ſword, he left the earth couered with his enemies bodies. God hauing then giuen (deare father) to the Chriſtians, a Prince ſo valiant, hardie, coragious, wiſe, good and iuſt, and to take him from them againe in ſo ſhort a time (for he was aged but 24. yeares, 7. monethes, and 15. dayes) he ſhould ſhew himſelfe cruell and very vniuſt to them; and as for my ſelfe, I ſhould ſo hold and eſteeme him. (A diſcrete anſwere out of an infidels mouth, conſidering he was better grounded in good ſpeech, then gouerned by the rule of truth: becauſe among the attributes which we giue to God, one of the moſt proper is, that he is an vpright Iudge, and the iudgements of all truth are iuſtified by himſelfe, as the kingly Prophet Dauid euidently ſhewes vs in the 18. Pſalme and 10. verſe.) And becauſe (quoth he, proceeding) that I hold it for moſt certaine, that he is aliue, know that I came from the battell with him, and with the king Muley Mahamet my deare brother, and riding along the riuer of Larache, to paſſe on the other ſide, certaine Moores gaue vs the chaſe ſome ſixe leagues from the field of battell. So that we were forced to ſeparate our ſelues one from another, I paſſed the riuer, leauing the king and my brother on the other ſide. He was very ſore hurt vpon one arme, and the bloud ran forth thereat abundantly: ſo that if he be dead, it was vpon that wound, otherwiſe

without all doubt he is liuing. I ſweare to your fatherhood, that my words are of truth.
               My ſelfe hauing diſcourſed this ſtory to diuerſe perſons, as well in Portugall as ſome other parts of Spaine, whence I departed in the yeare 1581. conſtrained to leaue my countrey, as well for further freedome, as to ſaue my ſelfe from the menaced danger of mine enemie, to paſſe into Fraunce, ſo to England, Holland, Zeland, and other quarters of Germany and Europe. Moſt worthy Lord, this may ſerue as a true teſtimony for me before mē, to ſtop the mouthes of ſome aduerſaries, who according to their deprauing cuſtome, ſay that I haue not ſpoken this vpon mine oath, but onely inuented it. He further named many to me that were forced to flight, whoſe names I do not now very well remember. I thinke I haue remembrance of them at Paris among my papers written by the hand of a Gentleman, a Portugueze, who was named Sebaſtian Figuéra, which he gaue me three yeares after, as I demanded diuers queſtions of him concerning that day, to inſert them in a booke which I was then making. The ſame Gentleman parted with the king, who about foure leagues from the field of battell, commanded him to turne backe againe, to vnderſtand whether the enemie purſued ſtill o
                     •
                   no: which he did, but comming backe the ſame way to ſeeke the king, he could not ſee any of them that he had parted withall. And he had not gone far, but being grieuouſly wounded, he was taken by the Moores: who queſtioning with him about king Sebaſtian, to the ende they ſhould deſiſt from his further purſuite, he told them that he ſaw his bodie lying among the dead. Many yeares ſince I heard the ſame ſtorie, out of the ſame Gentlemans mouth.
               In all the ſpeech I had with Cid Albequerin about king Sebaſtian, and in all my conference with mine vncle, and this laſt mentioned gentleman with diuerſe others, I neuer heard any report of his garments, nor of his armes, which were much differing from thoſe of other Princes and gentlemen; which made me euermore hold it for moſt certaine that he was ſtill aliue, becauſe he could not be found dead in the battell. And this beleefe was ſecretly kept among the Portugals, although publikely they agreed with others and ſpake the contrarie: therefore let no bodie blame vs in firmely maintaining, that this ſhould appeare to be

I ſay now to your reuerend Lordſhip, as then I anſwered the ſelfe ſame Prince: My Lord, your argument is very forcible, neuertheleſſe you muſt know, that when I made that booke which was in the yere 1581. it was no long while after king Sebaſtian had thus loſt himſelfe, and as then it was a matter extreamely perillous to manifeſt this truth: becauſe that as Latine bookes might paſſe into Barbarie, the king of that countrie gathering knowledge thereby, that the king Dom Sebaſtian was in thoſe parts, and cauſing him by ſearch to be found out, I might be iuſtly taxed with the cauſe of his loſſe, which had bene very great to all Chriſtendome. But would you vouchſafe to ſee the booke I made, De iure quod competie viris Portugallenſibus in augurandis ſuis Regibus a
                        •
                      Principibus, which I writ in the yeare 1588. you ſhall there find, that when I ſpeake of the king Dom Sebaſtian, I iuſtifie him not to be dead: and that the bodie which was buried in Bethlehem as his, was the bodie of a Swizzer. In the ſaid yeare▪ becauſe it was ſo long ſince the matter had paſt, I held it as no inconuenience to ſpeake the contrarie to what I had ſaid before: wherefore I intreat, that this may ſerue as an anſwere and ſatisfaction to the alleaged argument. As for the bodie (worthie ſir) whether it were his or no; I ſay once again that it was not, & that the body buried in Bethlehem, in the moneth of Ianuarie 1583. I then being priſoner in Lisbon, with 40. pound waight of yron on my feete, by the commaundement of D. Philip II. king of Caſtile, was the bodie of a Swizzer, for ſo the Portuguezes commonly called him. They that viſited me in priſon (the number was but ſmall, but they were people of great authoritie) mockt ſuch as ſaid it was the bodie of Dom Sebaſtian, and often ſpake thus to me: Oh happie

                   is the deſire I haue to ſee ſo ſtraunge a maruell in my time, then any hope I haue at all of accompliſhmēt of thoſe Prophecies, which your holy fatherhood may behold in the diſcourſe annexed to the end of this anſwere, and that diſcourſe, the reuerend Father Doctor Sampayo, intituled Diuinum Oraculum, &c.
               
               To prooue that that bodie was not the bodie of our king Dom Sebaſtian, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   ſufficeth to know, that many ſaw him liuing, who at this very day are dwelling, foure, fiue and ſixe leagues diſtant from the field of battell. Moreouer I remember, that being by Gods grace eſcaped from the rigorous impriſonment wherein I was conferring of this matter with ſome religious perſons of my Order, who had endured bondage and ſlauerie: they all told me, that the king Dom Sebaſtian was in Barbarie with the Arabes, and liued in the mountaines. And I call to mind, that as the reuerend Father brother Thomas Sequera, Superiour of Ebora and my auncient friend came to viſite me, I ſaying to him, that I was much bound to Father Vincent of Aphonſeca (who was then Archbiſhop of Goa) for the kind fauours he had done me during my captiuitie: he anſwered me; If brother Vincent ſhewed himſelfe courteous to your fatherhoode, I beleeue he did it becauſe he was your kinſman (as indeed he was, but very farre off) not in reſpect he was any good Portugueze. Vnderſtand (my worthie

Lord) that this man was a very cunning craftie Spaniard, and was one of them we ſent for Barbarie. He was ſo bad a man, and of ſo vile a conſcience, that he durſt maintaine for certaintie, that the bodie of a Swizzer was the very true bodie of our king Dom Sebaſtian, when all other elſe affirmed the contrarie. He lies buried in Bethlehem, by commaundement of the King of Caſtile: but I truſt in God, that one day a king ſhall come into Portugal, who ſhall diſinterre him out of Bethlehem, and ſend him to be buried in the Eſcuriall.
               This brother 
                     Ʋincent of Afonſeca, when the king of Caſtile began to recompence the ſeruices of ſome of his partakers, but ſcarce faithfull friends to their owne countrie, was made Archbiſhop of Goa, which is Primate of all the Eaſt Indies, and D. Edward de Meneſes Viceroy of the ſaid Indies. Moreouer, the Portuguezes did ſo certainly aſſure themſelues of their king Dom Sebaſtians life, that a Portugall Maſon was ſo bold, as to publiſh himſelfe to be the ſaid king Dom Sebaſtian, and found in the action very many followers: who went with him ſtraight to Lisbon, and if he had entred the euen of S. Iohn Baptiſt, he had bene receiued in ſeate of the ſame king Dom Sebaſtian. But being badly councelled, he lodged that night a league off the citie, whither ſallied foorth diuerſe Caſtilian ſouldies and good ſtore of Portuguezes, that knew him to be a meere ſeducer. Whereupon, being forſaken of his aſſociates that followed him like vnarmed fooles, he was taken and hanged, and cauſed diuers others to be hanged likewiſe, of royall authoritie; among whom (to his owne great ill hap) was a Preſident hanged.
               Likewiſe in a certaine Prouince of Portugall, called Beyra a poore Portugueze of meane condition, gaue out himſelfe to be the King Dom Sebaſtian, and this was deliuered for a matter ſo true and confident, as the Cardinall of Auſtria, who at this day is Archduke, and earle of Flaunders, being Viceroy in Portugall, determined to withdraw himſelfe thence into Caſtile. Neuertheleſſe, following the counſell of the fiue Gouernours of Portugall, who gouerned the kingdome conioyntly with him, he ſent to Captaine Gil de Meſa, who now is one of the gentlemen of the chamber to the moſt chriſtian King, that he ſhould go with his companie of two hundred men, and to take the man there, and

bring him thither with all honour and reuerence: becauſe if he chaunced to be that man he named himſelfe to be, he would redeliuer into his hands the ſcepter, and the Crowne belonging to the Portugall Kings and their kingdomes. Gil de Meſa went on his iourney, and arriuing in the Prouince of Beyra, came to the towne of Penamacor, and finding the man, tooke him very eaſily, and brought him along with him to Lisbon: where being knowne for an impoſtor, he was publickely whipped with rods, and after ſent to the gallies: he was liuing ſtill not many yeares ſince, and euerie one called him ſober Sebaſtian. He was not hanged, becauſe in his triall he could not be charged with any other crime, then this which was but of his owne inuention. Laſtly, we know that in Spaine, a Cooke or Pye-baker of Madrigall, made himſelfe to be held for the king Sebaſtian, and in ſecret cauſed it ſo to be giuen foorth: but afterward, as each of this falſe opinion had found before, he was knowne to be an abuſer, and for he had committed other very hainous offences, was executed according to iuſtice.
               Theſe examples do witneſſe perfectly to our eyes, that ſince the loſſe of their king Sebaſtian in Aff
                     •
                  icke, all the Portuguezes haue euermore taken him to be liuing: and hereby appeareth ſufficiently that he is not dead, neither was that his body which was buried in Bethlehem. Moreouer, by the ſame examples your worthy Lordſhip may eaſily iudge, that this man held as a priſoner at Venice, is the King Dom Sebaſtian himſelfe, conſidering that in two yeares and fiue monethes already paſſed, ſince he firſt began to manifeſt himſelfe, the Seigneurie continually found from day to day, more euident appearance ſtill of truth, without encountring any thing whatſoeuer to the contrary, or could be beleeued for certaine, in all the allegations of the Embaſſadour from Caſtile againſt the priſoner. The Lords of this honorabble eſtate, warned by the ſucceſſe of ſuch falſe impoſtors, may the better excuſe themſelues, that they haue with ſuch extremity and long delay, proceeded againſt the very perſon of king Dom Sebaſtian. Which being ſo, and the diuine Oracle enſuing added hereto: I hope I haue anſwered (reuerend Lord) your ſecond demaund.

            AS the al-good and moſt mighty God, dispoſeth things with no leſſe oportunity then clemency, it is come to paſſe that ſince the time of ſome foure yeares past, there hath bene found in Portugall two memories or monuments, of moſt venerable antiquity, in a very celebrate Monaſtery of the order of the Ciſteaux, which we commonly call the Abbay of Alcobaça, as the fathers of that couent ſearched among their papers and regiſters, for certaine priueledges for their warrant for a kind of vexation, whereof it ſhall be needleſſe to ſpeake at this time. And in ſhort while after they were preſented to Philip II. king of Caſtile, by the Priour Prouinciall of the ſayd order, and read apart each from other before his Catholike Maieſty, and then againe redeliuered backe to the Monaſtery: both which (for certaine cauſes) haue bene brought to light, and the tranſlation of them conferred with the originall.
         
         
            The oath of Dom Alphonſo firſt king of Portugall, for approbation and aſſurance of the viſion, which he ſaw the yeare MCXL. in the Prouince of Campo d'Ourique.
            I Alphonſo firſt King of Portugall, ſonne to the famous Earle Henry, graund child or ſonne to the great King Alphonſo, before you worthy perſonages, the Archbiſhop of Braga; and the Biſhop of Coimbre, and Theotonio, and you other Lords, officers, and ſubiects of my kingdome: do ſweare vpon this Croſſe,

and on this booke of the moſt holy Euangeliſts, which I touch with my hands; that I a miſerall ſinner, haue ſeene with mine vnworthy eyes, my Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſpread abroad vpon the croſſe, in manner following.
            I being with mine armie in the land which is neare to the riuer Tagus, in the Prouince of Campo d'Ourique, to giue battell to Iſmael, and to foure other kings of the Moores, who had with them infinite thouſands of men at armes: and my people being ſomewhat ſad and fearefull, to behold ſuch a numberleſſe multitude of warriours, came vnto me and ſayd, that it would be ouer-much boldneſſe in vs to bid them battell. Whereupon, being very much afflicted with what I heard and ſaw, I began to ponder apart by my ſelfe what I were beſt to do. In my pauillion I had a booke, containing both the old Teſtament and the new of Ieſus Chriſt; I opened it, and hapning to reade the victorie of Gedeon, I began thus to ſay to my ſelfe: Thou knoweſt ô Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that for the loue of thee, I haue vndertaken this warre againſt thine enemies: Lord, it is in thy hand to giue me and mine ſtrength to vanquiſh theſe blaſphemers of thy name. And ſpeaking ſo I fell aſleepe vpon the ſayd booke, and ſleeping, I ſaw an olde man come to me, ſaying: Alphonſe, take good courage, for thou ſhalt vanquiſh and put to repulſe all theſe Kings here, and ſhalt breake their forces, and God ſhall ſhew himſelfe to thee. As I was in this viſion, ſuddenly came to me Ferdinand de Souſa gentleman of my chamber, who awaking me, ſayd: Sir, raiſe your ſelfe, for here is an olde man come to ſpeake with you. Let him enter, ſayd I: if he be any of our friends. When the man was come in, I knew him to be the ſame good olde man which I had ſeene in my viſion; he ſayd vnto me: Sir, be of good cheare, you ſhall vanquiſh, you ſhall vanquiſh, and you ſhall not be vanquiſhed. God loues you, for he hath caſt the eyes of his mercy vpon you, and on your race, euen to the ſixteenth generation, wherein your ligne ſhall be weakened and diminiſhed. Neuertheleſſe, in this diminution and feebling, there ſhall be no want of his diuine fauour and ſuccour. He hath commaunded me to tell you, that when you do heare in the night enſuing, the bell of mine hermitage, wherein I haue liued ſixtie ſixe yeares among the infidels, and in the protection of

the moſt high: you ſhall come foorth of your campe, all alone without company and he will make his great mercy appeare vnto you. I obeyed, and proſtrating my ſelfe in reuerence to the ground, worſhipped the meſſenger, and him that ſent him.
            And as I attended in prayer the ſecond watch of the night, I heard the bell, then (armed with my ſword and ſhield) I went foorth of the campe. Then I ſaw on my right hand toward the Eaſt, a bright beame in the element, the ſplendour whereof increaſed more and more. And as I held mine eyes reſpectiuely fixed on that quarter, I ſaw in that beame (ſhining brighter then the Sunne) the bleſſed Croſſe, and Ieſus Chriſt crucified thereupon: likewiſe both on the one ſide and other, a multitude of young men ſeeming verie white, whom I accounted to be holy Angels. When I had beheld this viſion, I layd by my ſword, ſhield and garment, put off my ſhoes, and being proſtrated along vpon the earth, I wept abundantly: then going to intreate ſtrength and preſeruation for my ſubiects, without any trouble I ſpake in this manner: Lord, to what ende doſt thou ſhew thy ſelfe to me? wouldſt thou increaſe the faith of him that only beleeues in thee? It were better (Lord) that theſe infidels ſhould ſee thee, to the end that they might beleeue: as for my ſelfe, from the day of my baptiſme, I haue knowne and acknowledged thee the true God, Sonne of the Virgin, and the Father eternall.
            This croſſe was of admirable greatneſſe, and eleuated from the earth about ten Cubites: and the Lord with a ſweete ſound of his voyce (which I heard with mine vnworthy eares) ſayd to me: I do not appeare vnto thee in this ſort, for increaſe of thy faith, but to comfort thy heart againſt this battell, and to fixe the chiefeſt Princes of this kingdome vpon a firme rocke. Courage Alphonſo, for thou ſhalt not onely vanquiſh and be conquerour in this battell, but likewiſe in all other which thou ſhalt fight againſt the enemies of the croſſe. Thou ſhalt find thy men cheerfully diſpoſed to the battell, and in the name of a king they will require thee to enter the fight; make thou no doubt at all, but liberally graunt whatſoeuer they demaund. For I build and deſtroy both Empires and Kingdomes, and I will eſtabliſh an Empire in thee and thy poſterity: to the end that my name may be ſpread and augmented, euen vnto the very vttermoſt nations.

And that thy ſucceſſours may know that I haue giuen thee thy kingdome, the Scutchion of your armies ſhall be fully beautified with the price whereby I bought mankind, and of thoſe wherewith the Iewes bought & ſold me: this ſhall be to me a ſanctified kingdome, for preſ
                  •
               auation of the faith, and louing of pietie.
            Hauing heard theſe wordes, I worſhipped and ſayd: For what merites (O Lord) doth it pleaſe thee to ſhew me ſo great grace? I will do whatſoeuer thou haſt commanded me: and Lord, looke fauourably on my poſterity as thou haſt promiſed me, and keepe my people of Portugall ſafe and ſound. But if any miſaduenture be to be endured, conuert it (Lord) rather againſt me and my ſucceſſours, and pardon my people whom I loue as my onely ſonne. Which the Lord ſhewing me he would conſent vnto: Neuer (quoth he) ſhall my mercie part from thee nor thine, for by them I am to prepare a great harueſt, and them haue I choſen for my harueſt labourers in lands farre remote. This ſayd, he vaniſhed, and I (full of confidence and contentment) returned to my campe. And that theſe matters hapned thus, I king Alphonſo ſweare by the holy Goſpels of Chriſt Ieſus, which I touch with theſe my hands. Wherefore I commaund my ſucceſſours that ſhall come for euer, that they beare in their armes fiue Scutchions parted in forme of a croſſe, becauſe of the croſſe and the fiue wounds of Ieſus Chriſt: and in each of them thirtie pence, and on the top or Creſt the Serpent of Moſes, being the figure of Ieſus Chriſt. And that this may be a memoriall to our generation; whoſoeuer ſhall go againſt it, let him be curſed of God, and with the traytor Iudas eternally tormented in hell.

This Sebaſtian was borne after his fathers deceaſe, when were very inſtant and frequent prayers, proceſſions and faſtings among the people of Portugall, in the yeare, 1554. the day of the two holy Martyrs, Fabian and Sebaſtian, a matter almoſt beyond all hope: for his father died in nonnage or very young, and his mother was but ſixteene yeares old. This Prince was of an exceeding good nature, high in courage, accompanied with great bodily ſtrength, godly and religious, and that in ſuch ſort, as euen from the cradle his ſubiects had him in much admiration, and they accounted him as another Caeſar Augustus, according as caries the ſignification of the name of Sebaſtian.

            An explication of ſome pointes contained in this Diſcourſe.
            
               In the Epiſtle to the Reader.
               THe cauſe why the religious perſons of Alcobaça ſought among their papers ſome priuiledges and Donations of the Kings of Portugall, was becauſe his Maieſtie Catholique Dom Philip II. King of Caſtille, pretended to ſell the iuriſdiction of ſeuen townes, whereof the ſaid Monaſterie is Lord. And becauſe this diuine Oracle was imprinted at Lisbone, it was made dangerous to declare the ſaid cauſe. Wherefore the father Doctor Sampayo ſaid, by way of parentheſis, that it was not good to ſpeake of it at that time.
            
            
               In the Oath of the King Dom Alphonſo.
               The ſaid King commaunded to his ſucceſſours, to come to the field with their ſhield of armes, containing fiue ſcutchions faſhioned like a croſſe, in each of which ſhould be figured the thirtie pence, for which our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt was ſold, &c. as more plainly is declared by the Notarie Apoſtolike Thomas de la Croix in his certificate, aſſuring that they were ſo figured on the ſeales. It may be that this commandement was obſerued at the firſt beginning of the Realmes of Portugall: but whether ſince then to this preſent, we do not find that it hath bin kept, chiefly ſince the raigne of Alphonſo third of that name, and fift king of Portugall, who was Earle of Bullen in Fraunce. He adioyned to the crowne of Portugal the Realmes of Algarbes, which were giuen him by Dom Alphonſo le ſage, King of Caſtille, and Emperour of the Eaſt, in dower of mariage with Domne Beatrix his daughter, not to meddle at al with the croſſe the firſt armes of Portugall (for firſt of all Portugall bare for armes a ſhield argent, without any other thing) he placed round about the ſhield which cōtained the fiue that faſhioned the ſaid Croſſe, ſeuen ſcutchions of gold, in a field Geules, which are the armes of the realmes of Algarbes, and ſince then to this preſent, the kings of Portugall haue euermore held the ſame armes, as they do at this day.
               
                  Stephen Garibay, in his abridgement of the hiſtory of Spaine,

ſpeaking of the Armes and Colours, cals thoſe Caſtelles of the Realmes of the Algarbes, which engirt the Scutchion of the armes of Portugal, Orla, in French Geule or a border, affirming that no other kingdome of Europe beares them but Portugall. By which reaſon we may ſay, that the Geule or border which we ſee about the armes of Fraunce, to wit, that of the order of S. Michael, and that of the holy Ghoſt, of the Golden Fleece in Burgundie, and that of the Garter in England &c. are but borrowed thence.
               Now to returne to our armes: the King Dom Emanuel ſeeing himſelfe in Europe, Lord of the kingdome of Portugall, and of the Realme of the Algarbe, which is in the prouince of Spaine; in Affricke of the other Realme of Algarbe, which is in the prouince of Barbarie; of all the coaſt of Guinee, euen to the Cape de bonne Eſperance, and from thence vnto the red ſea: and of a great number of the Iſles ſituate in the ſea of the ſaid Affrica; in Aſia of the Realme of Goa, and of a verie ſpacious Monarchie, conſidering he held nine Kings his ſubiects and tributaries, and foure Queenes: in America, of Breſil, a prouince of very large extenſion: he bare a Sphere for his deuice, which ſignified the rule that Portugall had in the foure quarters of the world. Adioying likewiſe, the Croſſe of the Order of the warfare of Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe the King of Portugall, being graund maiſter of the ſaid Order, is Lord of diuerſe lands and townes in Portugal, and of all the authoritie which the Portugueſes poſſeſſe abroad from thence. And becauſe ſundrie perſons haue demaunded of me how they ſhould vnderſtand theſe Scutchions and pence: I here tell them, that the fiue Scutchions in the Azure field ſet in one ſhield, the field whereof is Argent, each of them figured with fiue white pence, do ſignifie fiue kings Moores, vanquiſhed by one Chriſtian king. The kings of the Moores ſubdued, are Iſmael and his foure confederates: the vanquiſher is the king Dom Alphonſo the firſt, king of Portugall, from whom grew this commaundement. As for the pence, becauſe many haue alleaged to me, that in the fiue Scutchions, there are but xxv. pence and not thirtie, as other Authors and my ſelfe haue written: I ſhould be infinitely eaſed, if in remouing their doubt they wold but heare me. Would you find thirtie pence? Count firſt of all

the three Scutchions aboue and below, which containe fifteene pence, next, them that are trauerſed on the right ſide, ſo that that in the midſt be counted twiſe, conſidering it ſpreads vnto either hand: and there you ſhall find other fifteene pence, which ioyned to the firſt, complete the number of thirtie, and thus they may reſt ſatisfied in their demaund.
            
            
               To the Teſtimoniall of vaſſellage and feoffement. And becauſe I haue already rendred my ſelfe tributary, and all ſuch as ſhall appertaine to me, to the bleſſed S. Peter and his ſucceſſours, &c.
               WE finde in the hiſtories of Portugall, that in the yeare 1169. when Pope Alexander the ſixt approued the election of the King D. Alphonſo, and confirmed his kingdome to him: the king, by the conſent of his Portugueſes, made the ſaid kingdome feudatarie to the holy Church of Rome, promiſing to pay as in tribute euery yeare two pounds of gold. In the time ſince, there is no memoriall found at all, that this tribute hath bene payd: as likewiſe none of our Hiſtorians do ſhew vnto vs, that theſe fiftie Maruedies of gold haue bene payed to the Monaſterie of our Ladie of Clairueaux. And me thinks (worthy Lord) that it were not much from the purpoſe, to make here a digreſſion, thereby to acquaint your reuerend worthineſſe, vpon what reaſon the king Dom Alphonſo had ſuch deuotion to this Monaſterie of Noſtre dame de Clairuaux.
               
               The king Dom Alphonſo and S. Bernard did both liue at that time, and the king being informed of the wiſedome, learning, and reformed life of this holy man, and what miracles God wrought by his meanes, in fauour and for the benefite of the faithful: he began verie quickly to receiue him into good grace and opinion. At this verie time, the king had ſent his ſonne Sanche to beſiege the Citie of Santeren, called by the auncient Tordules S
                        •
                     alabis of Scabeliſque the firſt founder; and by the Romanes, Preſidium Iulium; by the Chriſtians, Santirenae, by reaſon of the holy Irena, a virgin & a Martyr, who ſuffred death there for the Chriſtian faith, in the yeare of our Lord 696. Then afterward by the Moores Capelicaſtrum. This was a Parliament

and colonie of the Empire, and one of the greateſt and moſt important townes of Luſitania, whereof the Moores were Lordes. The King thinking one while in this ſiege, and of the Fortreſſe of this cittie, becauſe it was built on a high mountaine, that it was a matter verie doubtfull and difficult to take and ſubdue: to purchaſe ayde and help of God by the interceſſion of our bleſſed Ladie the virgine, concluded in his ſoule, if he might happen to win the ſaid citie, to make her great offers, and to erect in his kingdome a great and notable monaſterie of Monkes of the order of the Cisteaux (whereof enſued the ſaid monaſterie of Clairuaux) which ſhould and did flouriſh greatly through the world, and ſo doth to this day. The King Dom Alphonſo ſoiourned then in the towne of Coimbre, which then was the capitall place of all the kingdome: within ſome few dayes after, the King departed from the ſaide towne, to be preſent at the ſiege with his ſonne and traine; and as he was vpon the way, there came before him two or three religious men of the ſaid order, who demaunded of him (on the behalfe of Frier Bernard) place for beginning the building of the monaſterie which he had promiſed. The King conſidering apart by himſelfe, and remembring that he had made this promiſe is his heart, and yet had not imparted it to any perſon whatſoeuer, and ſeeing that Frier Bernard, who was diſtant off from him more then three hundred miles, knew therof, he took it as a good augurie or preſage, and began to hold it for certaintie, that the heauenly Architect would not ſlack his grace toward him, but that without all doubt he ſhould conquer the ſaid citie. Hauing then giuen good and charitable welcome to the religious men, he ſaid: My brethren, you come in a verie apt ſeaſon, let vs iourney on together, and I will recount it vnto you, as alſo make accompliſhment of my promiſe, ſo ſoone as I haue recouered the citie of Santaren frō the Moores, which I haue beſieged by my ſon & ſoldiers.
               Three dayes after the arriuall of the King there, the citiie was wonne and taken, more by the help of heauen, then by the valour and ſtrength of the Chriſtians: albeit no way to diſparage their deſeruing, they fought like hardie and very valiant men. The King doing the dutie of a moſt braue Prince and Captaine, ſeeing him ſelfe in extreame great danger at the entrance of a gate which he had wonne, wheron is an imag of our Lady, and is called the gate

of our Lady Alamarma, which is as much to ſay as, faſten o
                     •
                   mine Armes, the very portugall words which the King vſed then to his Squire, becauſe one had vntied the buckles of his armour. The King being made Lord of a place of ſuch weighty importance, marked out forthwith to the ſaide religious men a great quantitie of ground, whereon they ſhould begin to build their monaſterie; which afterward increaſed in ſuch ſort, as in ſhort time the number amounted to 999. They liued in particuler little celles, diſperſed among the vallies and mountaines: and on feaſt dayes they would meete together to praiſe the Lord. The religious men of this monaſterie doe hold by tradition, that their number ſhall neuer amount to a thouſand, becauſe if they giue the habite to one within the church, they ſhall find another to be dead without. This hath bene aſſured to me by perſons of good yeares, religious men of the ſaid monaſterie, who call themſelues d' Alcobaça, among whom are diuers of my kinred.
               A thing which (right worthie Lord) may verie wel be ſo For if if we ſhall giue credite to Camden an Engliſh hiſtorian, who yet liueth at this day, and is an author worthie of beleefe: he certifies to to vs in his Brittania, that in the land which at this day is called England (which ſuch as are ſeene in Coſmography, know to be no greater thē the kingdom of Portugal, with that of Algarbe in Luſitania) a tyrant King put to death twelue thouſand religious perſons, becauſe they followed the part of another, who was the true and rightfull King. The ſame Camden doth tell vs, that theſe religious people were of a monaſterie, which was diuided into three ſeuerall bands, and that the leaſt companie of them contained ſeuen hundred compleate. But to come to our purpoſe, theſe religious folke of Alcobaça, builded by ſucceſſion of time, in the great breadth of ground granted them by the King Dom Alphonſo, ſeuen citties, ſo do the Spaniards call them, and the Latines, oppida ſiue vrbes, becauſe that almoſt all of them are engirt with walles, and haue caſtels, as in France, Poiſſy, Meulan, Mante, Vernon, &c.
               
               
                  Philip II. King of Castille, would haue ſold the iuriſdiction of them, as he hath ſold others in Spain belonging to the Church. This moued the fathers of the ſaid monaſterie, to turne ouer their papers, and was the cauſe, that we ſaw with our eies a donation ſo

deuout and holy, made to the bleſſed mother of God our Ladie of Clairuaux, whereof Saint Bernard hath bin Abbot. Now reuerend Lord, may it pleaſe you licence me, to come to the declaration of ſome words in the propheſies which perhaps may ſeem difficult to ſome whereſoeuer.
            
            
               Concerning that of S. Cyril the Hermite. Tempore annorum. 54. &c.
               This propoſition hath lately beene declared elſewhere, ſpeaking of the King Dom Sebaſtian, who was borne in the yeere 1554. the 20. of Ianuarie, betweene eleuen and twelue of the clocke at night, as I well remember. I lacking bookes here, and haue not my memorie ſo good (worthie Lord) now, as in times paſt, my trauails, baniſhments, ſickneſſes (eſpecially the laſt) hath depriued me of the better part, ſo that I cannot now cite ſome common knowne Pſalmes without booke, which I had in my yonger yeeres by heart, and could ſay readily.
            
            
               Concerning that of S. Iſidore. Occultus Rex bis piè datus. &c.
               This may be verie wel applied to Dom Sebaſtian my Lord and king: becauſe that after the twelfth of Ianuarie, the day whereon his father died, aged but ſixteene yeeres and ſeuen moneths, till the twentie of the ſaid moneth, An. 1554. when he was borne: at Lisbone throughout all Portugall, day and night they made continuall proceſſions, faſtings and prayers, with very much deuotion and great ſtore of tears, as the reuerend father doctor Sampaye makes known in his Epiſtle to the reader. The reaſon was, becauſe the Portuguezes feared, that the kingdom ſhould fal into the Spaniards hands. For that when the King D. Iohn 3. grandfather to to King D. Sebaſtian, gaue his daughter Mary as wife to Philip then prince of Caſtille, it was ſaid by the contract of this mariage, that if it happened that the King D. Iohn ſhould deceaſſe without

children, he that ſhould be borne of Philip and Mary ſhould be heyre to the kingdome of Portugall, whereto the people then conſented (ſay ſome) but repented afterward, that they laboured not to contend rather by law or warre, which queſtionleſſe had not wanted, becauſe the Lord Dom Edward ſonne to the infant Dom Edward brother to the ſaid King. D. Iohn. 3. then liued, who was a Lord endued with many ſingular vertues, and as a legitimate Prince borne of Kings by the ligue maſculine, did euermore claime the ſucceſſion of his anceſtors in the ſaid kingdome, which neuer yet fell vnto the diſtaffe. Hereupon the Portuguezes prayed to God ſo inſtantly, with ſo many proceſſions, faſts, prayers and teares, that it might pleaſe him to giue them a Lord and Prince. Thus by diuine grace was Dom Sebaſtian giuen to the Portuguezes the firſt time, and thus now againe he giues him the ſecond time.
            
            
               An anſwere to the third demand.
               For manie cauſes (right reuerend Lord) it was not neceſſarie for the King Dom Sebaſtian to diſcouer himſelfe in Barbary: of al which we wil alleage but two. The firſt, if he had manifeſted himſelfe, he had run into great danger of his lifes loſſe, for his enemie could not more eaſily haue put him to death, then in Barbarie. There are a great number of officers kept in pay, who giue them ſuch morſels, which is called the Boccon, or poiſoned bit, as the poore patient cannot by anie meanes eſcape: they limit them to the yeare, moneth, daies: what ſhall I ſay? to verie houres and moments. The ſecond, if Muley Hamet had got him into his power, the leaſt that he would haue demaunded for his ranſome, had been the cities and townes which the Portuguezes poſſeſſe in Barbarie. This had beene a ſmall gift for him, Tanger, Arzile, Mazagan, and the other places which the Kings of Portugall do hold in Barbarie. Neuertheleſſe, Septa had bin great loſſe to Chriſtendom, for it is the key of Affricke and Europe. And the Moores hauing that in their own power, at all times, and whenſoeuer they were thereto diſpoſed, they might paſſe into Spaine an hundred thouſand horſe and more, and from Spaine poſt to other parts of Europe, as ſomtimes they did, when they were not ſo well inured to warre, nor expert in Armes. Our hiſtories of Portugall doe tell vs, that the infant Dom Fernand being taken by the

Moores in the field of the citie of Tanger, as he there held his ſiege: ſome few daies after, they came to demaund for his raunſome onely the citie of Septa, which his father the King Dom Iohn of worthie memorie, the Baſtard, had won from the Mores. The king (that then was) Dom Edward, for the ſingular loue he bare to his brother, reſolued with his people (who loued the Prince entirely) to giue what they had demaunded. The infant Dom Fernand being aduertiſed of his brothers kind reſpect, and the peoples goodwill to him likewiſe, found the meanes to write ſecretly vnto them, that they ſhould be very carefull what they did, ſaying: God forbid, that by my occaſion Chriſtendome ſhould endure ſuch a damage: I had rather be partaker among an hundred thouſand martyrs, or die in captiuitie in the Infidels cuſtodie, then cauſe ſuch a manifeſt daunger to all Chriſtendome.
               The Mores following ſtill their motion (yet vſing the infant and his companie with extreame crueltie) came to the knowledge, that it was hindred much more by the ſaid infant, then the king his brother: whereupon they began to intreate him in farre better manner, that he might the gladlier conſent to his owne redemption. But they could no way worke him, to preferre his owne particular benefite, before the weale publique of Chriſtendome. So that the Moores growing much diſpleaſed hereat, put him into an iron priſon, without any bed or ſeate, and ſo placed him before the gates of the citie of Marocco, giuing him daily to eate certaine ounces of bread, and a little water to drinke. After ſome few moneths, this holy Lord rendred his ſpirit to his Creator, in that rigorous priſon, ſuffering a glorious martirdome, for the common good of all Chriſtians, after the example of his Lord Ieſus Chriſt, redeemer of the whole world. His bodie is buried in the Couent of our Ladie of victorie, which is of mine Order, commonly called de la Battaille, in the Chappell of king D. Iohn his father, where God (in regard of him) did continually many miracles, for aduancement of the Chriſtian faith.
               The religious Fathers of the ſaid Couent, on the day of his death do not vſe to ſing any Maſſe of Requiem, but that of all Saints, (becauſe he was not canonized, nor yet beatified) wherin he is contained amongſt them. Frier Ierome de Ramos, a religious man of mine Order, writ a booke concerning the life of this

glorious Saint, in the Portugall language. Which booke I beleeue that the king Dom Sebaſtian hath both ſeene and read, and that in imitation of the ſaid Saint, who was brother to his fourth grandfather, I am certainely perſwaded, that he hauing ſo apt meanes to conceale himſelfe, would not be diſcouered: for ſhould he haue there bene reuealed to the Mores, they might haue come and demaunded for his ranſome, the townes and cities elſewhere ſet downe, nay the citie of Septa it ſelfe. And doubtleſſe, the Portuguezes would haue giuen them all, nay rather much more, for the libertie of a King ſo good, ſo vertuous, and ſo holy, whome they loued with ſuch and ſo great affection, as if he had bene a God and their redeemer.
               The king Dom Sebaſtian (moſt worthie Lord) was naturally ſo Catholike and chriſtianly addicted, that for the adding but of a very pulſe breadth of ground to Chriſtendome, he would moſt gladly haue yeelded himſelfe captiue. And therefore we may well coniecture and credit his good nature, that when he could not get away without danger of his life, and likewiſe in reſpect of Chriſtendomes generall benefite, he held it much more glorious for him to die in priſon and ſlauerie in Barbarie, then to liue at libertie being Lord and Monarch of the world. Thus, right reuerend Lord, giue we end to the anſwer of your third demaund.
            
            
               An anſwer to the fourth demaund.
               Some do coniecture, that he hath bene amongſt the Moores in Barbarie many yeares. Which very well be ſo (although ſuch as haue not bene accuſtomed to frequent that countrey, do imagine it impoſſible) and oftentimes it hath ſo happened to the Portuguezes, that they haue liued captiues in Barbarie for the ſpace of 10.12.15.20.25. and 30. yeares, without any tidings heard of them all. The reaſon is, that al ſlaues Noble do appertain to the King, and ſuch as hold them in their cuſtodie, are bound to make like deliuerie to him of them. Whereby very often the Lords of the Moores, knowing their ſlaues to be of noble race, diſſemble with them, that they may not loſe them: and that they may find meanes to be rid of them, graunting them for their libertie ſome reaſonable ranſome.
               So got out of captiuitie the Prince my Lord Dom Antonio,
                  
who died at Paris with the title of King of Portugall, becauſe he had bene elected, receiued, ſworne and confirmed by the people, King of the ſaid Realme: who being ſlaue to a particular man, his good fortune fauoured him ſo much as not to be knowne: and he mette with another ſlaue of his companie, an Affricane Gentleman, who ſpake verie well the language of the Coimbre, and called himſelfe Gaspar de Gran. This man made his maiſter beleeue, that this ſlaue Dom Antonio, was a Prieſt which would neuer be redeemed thence, becauſe his kindred were very glad of his life in impriſonment, for thereby they had in meane while the benefite of his goodes and rents: wherefore he gaue him counſell, that it were much better for him to make ſome reaſonable compoſition, then to be a looſer altogether. In the end, the matter was ſo concluded, that for the raunſome of the Prince and the ſaid Gentleman, the ſumme of ſixe hundred Cruzadoes muſt be paid him, which are Crowns valuing fiftie ſolz or ſouſe Tournois. And the Mores parted thence with them, neuer trauelling but by night, but hiding them ſelues all the day time: and on the fift or ſixt day after they arriued in the night at the gates of Arzile, where entring maſqued, they left their ſlaues, receiued their money, and then returned backe to their houſes. If the Lord Dom Antonio had bene knowne for ſuch as he was, and had fallen into the power of the king of Barbarie, his matter had ſorted a quite contrarie way: for the ſlaues to the king are kept in very ſtrong guard, and if they hold tenne thouſand crownes rent, there will be demaunded fiftie thouſand for their raunſome, which if they will not make promiſe of, they muſt endure the ſharpe baſtonnadoes. The ſlaues that are to other particular men, are much more nearer their libertie: either by getting ſuch a ſumme of money, ſauing themſelues otherwiſe, or enlarged at length by the meanes of their Miſtreſſes. It is a thing verie ordinarie in Barbarie, worthie Lord, for the women Moores do extremely loue Chriſtians: & many times they receiue libertie by the meanes of them, and likewiſe get very good gifts frō them.
               In like ſort diuerſe are freed and ſcape vnknowne, by meanes of the religious Fathers of the moſt holy Trinitie, which are called the Order De Redemptione captiuorum, in Fraunce we call them Mathurines. There is commonly Monkes of this

Order in Barbarie, who deale with the Moores for the raunſome of Chriſtians: which Monkes do paſſe through all the Realmes of Barbarie, clothed in their habits, with verie much libertie, and haue great credit with the Moores. Among whom, if they find ſome man of qualitie, that is not knowne at all, they compound immediatly for his raunſome, and counting downe the money, or promiſing to pay it in a limited time, they ſet him at libertie.
               I thinke reuerend Sir (becauſe I can yet vnderſtand no further of matters paſſed) that my Lord the king Dom Sebaſtian, hath neuer bene held as priſoner: or if he haue, it was his good happe to meete with an honeſt maiſter, with whome he liued ſo long, as till he could obtaine his libertie, or compaſſe the meanes to make an eſcape. And as we do imagine, he hath bene wandring among the Aethiopians, as your worthie ſelfe may gather by the tranſlation of two letters written vnto me, the one from the Father doctor Sampayo, the other from Dom Iohn de Caſtro: the originals whereof remaine in my cuſtodie, with ſeuen or eight other letters of theirs, which they did ſend to me frō Venice.
               In this demaund likewiſe, your reuerend Lordſhip praies me to tell you▪ for what reaſon my Lord the king Dom Sebaſtian, did not come into Fraunce, or to any place elſe, where doubtleſſe he might haue bene receiued according to his qualitie: namely, with better entertainment then he had at Venice? I anſwere, that being by Gods grace reſtored to libertie, himſelfe will deliuer the cauſes that mooued him, to go and preſent himſelfe before the Lords there, and thoſe likewiſe which withheld him from comming into Fraunce or elſewhere, according as your ſelfe haue alleaged. As for my knowledge of him, it ſufficeth me to heare the ſpeech of him, I being in one place, and he in another. But comming to the ſight of him, I can demaund and know diuerſe notable things of him, which is impoſſible for him to haue altogether forgotten: for aſſuredly he can and will reſolue me in one or other. For ſince the time I became religious (which was at two and twentie yeares, and 26. daies of mine age) he being then aged 12. yeares, one moneth, and 28. daies, I haue ſeene him in diuerſe quarters of Portugall, and conferred with him of very important affaires. Before I was religious, he being aged ſeuen or eight yeares, I ſerued as a Page to his Grandmother, his fathers

mother, who was ſiſter to the Emperours Charles the fift, and Ferdinand, and graund-mother to the moſt Chriſtian Queene Maria de Medicis: and for this reaſon he is very neare kinſman to the ſayd Maieſty, coſin germaine remoued by the fathers ſide, Iohn the ſonne of Catherine, and likewiſe coſin germaine remoued by his mothers ſide, Iane, who was eldeſt daughter to the ſayd Charles the fift brother to Catherine. This which hath bene ſayd (ioyned with the tranſlation of the two miſſiues enſuing,) may ſerue as anſwer to your fourth demaund.
            
         
         
            The tranſlation of a letter from the father Doctour Sampayo.
            To the Rright reuerend father and Doctor, the father Frier Ioſeph Texere Portugueze, Counceller and Almoner to the moſt Chriſtian King, in our couent of the friers preachers at Paris.
            
                Moſt reuerend father and maiſter:
            
            I Haue heretofore written to your fatherhood concerning this preſent matter, and becauſe I know not whether my letters haue bene deliuered you or no, I determined to ſend one more after the reſt. Perſwade your ſelfe (holy father) and euen as God ſhall deale with my ſoule in the article of death: that no other motiue ſtirres me hereunto, but onely brotherly affection, truth and zealous loue to the liberty of my countrey.
            The King Dom Sebaſtian our Lord, is priſoner here in this city, and ſo hath bene for two and twenty monethes: whom God (in his iudgements concealed to himſelfe) hath permitted to come hither, tranſported to this place very poorely, and robbed by fiue of his owne ſeruants which he entertained in Cicilie. But ſo ſoone as he arriued here in this city (where he hoped to find good fauor and ſupport) immediatly the Embaſſadour of Caſtile perſecuted him moſt cruelly: perſwading the Seigneurie, that he was a Calabrois, a theefe, &c. For this cauſe the Lords impriſoned him, and rigorouſly proceeded againſt him: here they keepe him cloſe

ſhut vp, not ſuffering him to be ſeene, nor enlarged, nor execute any act of iuſtice vpon him: Quia nullam inuenient in eo cauſam. Becauſe they can find no iuſt cauſe againſt him.
            Our ſinnes are great, great is the ſtrength of Spaine, and the malice of the Iewiſh Portuguezes in this countrey, whereof ſome weare red bonnets, and others blacke: but the laſt are moſt dangerous. They thinke that they can impeach what God hath ordained ab aeterno, as the diuell would haue done the death of Ieſus Chriſt, by the meanes of the wife of Pilate. That this is very true, I ſweare to your fatherhood, by the paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt: that this man is as truly the King Dom Sebaſtian, as I am knowne to be Frier Stephen de Sampayo. And if it be not found to proue accordingly, let me not only (be condemned as a lyer, but for a renegate, a blaſphemer and an hereticke. For this, haue I endeuored my very vttermoſt diligence in my Portugall voyage. I haue bene on one ſide and another, and vnderſtand ſecretly, that he hath all the markes on his body, without failing in any one of them, as he had in his infancy, onely the wounds excepted which he receiued in the bloudy day at Affricke. He giues the reaſon of his life, and yeelds account of all his paſſages in ſuch ſort, as there is no vnderſtanding ſo obſtinate and blind, but muſt thereby be vtterly vanquiſhed; and God be my helper, as this is the truth.
            Theſe Lords do expect, that Kings and Princes ſhould vndertake this buſineſſe, at whoſe inſtance they would admit vs to haue ſight and knowledge of him: becauſe they would not be faulty toward the Spaniard: for they ſay, they would not incurre the ill will of any one. This is an occaſion whereby your reuerend fatherhood may purchaſe more honour, and performe farre greater ſeruice to God, thē euer any Portugueze did: in comming hither, & bringing ſuch letters of fauor with you, as may obtaine for vs the ſight of him, and by examination to apprehend the very certainty, for here you ſhall find with vs more thē twelue perſons, of all the eſtates of his time to know him by. He hath bene ſo vnfortunate, that leauing all his companions ſcattered through the world, he is here arriued without any one of them. Dom George de Lancaſtre, Duke of A
                     •
                  eyro, whom he left in Aethiopia, were ſufficicient for his deliuerance, if he were here preſent.
            I humbly pray your fatherhood, that vpon ſight of this preſent

letter, you would ſpeedily iourney hither, for your perſonall being here is very neceſſary: conſidering withall, that a religious man your brother, of the order of S. Dominicke, vſes theſe perſwaſions to you, one that deſires your good, honor and quiet, with as earneſt affection as his owne.
            It is ſeuenteene monethes ſince I put hand to this ſeruice, I haue bene in Portugall, and returned thence as I haue told you, & it is impoſſible for me to be abuſed as ſome are: who thinke this man not to be the King Dom Sebaſtian, but that the Seigneurie detaines another hidden in ſtead of him. This man here, knowne and reknowne for ſuch, by the Concierges, by the Iudges, by the greater part of the Senate, and by his owne Confeſſor, yet ſuch is the inuention of this worlds children, as they imagine themſelues more powerfull then God, and would preſume to aboliſh ſo maruellous a worke of the Lord.
            I haue written to the Gouernour, and to many other; I know not what the ſinnes are of our Portugezes in Fraunce, who were wont to oppoſe their liues to extreame daungers, and hazard loſſe of their goods (with very good zeale) for a figure: and will they not now with ſo much honor, in an action of truth and glory, make their owne aduantage and benefit, not for a ſhadow, but for a rightfull King, whoſe life (both in the priſon and abroad) rauiſheth all the countrey with admiration, by the meanes of his faſtings, prayers, and diſciplines? notwithſtanding all which, his ſtrength is not a iot impaired, for he is of very maruellous fortitude.
            Whoſoeuer will ſay, that this man is a Calabrois, and that he ſpeakes not a word of Portugall: he lies, he is the true King of Portugall Dom Sebaſtian, and ſpeaketh Portugall (though ſomewhat corrupted, becauſe it is 22. yeares ſince he ſpake the language vſually. Whoſoeuer ſayth that they haue ſhewne him to vs, he lies: for to delay and winne time withall, theſe Lords ſent me to Portugall, to be enformed of the markes of his body, telling me, that otherwiſe they would not let me ſee him, and that the Portugals had ſuch forward deſire to be free from the Spaniards, as they would maintaine (if need were) that their king Dom Sebaſtian was but a Negro. Now albeit that I haue brought ſo many authentical markes, approued by publicke inſtruments from a Notary Apoſtolicke,

I haue intreated that we may haue ſight of him, to examine him, and make knowne the truth or falſhood of the caſe, by the certifications which I brought hither with me, as alſo a Chanon of Lisbone that came along with me. It was anſwered vs from the Senate, after diuerſe and ſundry conteſtations; that it was not a matter belonging to them, to know whether he were a king or no, without ſome Kings and Princes moued the ſame to them on his behalfe.
            I ſpeake ſo amply to your fatherhood, becauſe you may perceiue with what zeale I write at this inſtant. I iuſtifie againe vnto you, and ſweare by the eternall God, by his only begotten ſonne, and by all our faith: that this priſoner is our true Lord the King Dom Sebaſtian. If your reuerend ſelfe would come with letters from his moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie, I beleeue that without any hinderance, they would ſhew him to vs, and vpon acknowledging, let vs haue him enlarged. We are now going to moue our requeſt to his Holineſſe, that it might pleaſe him to ſet a helping hand to this buſineſſe, conſidering it is a caſe ſo iuſt and meritable of pitty, wherein we doubt not but to haue his furtherance.
            With this preſent I haue ſent you the oath of the holy King, to the end that you may make it publicke by impreſſion: and by the firſt conuenient meanes, I will ſend you a letter which his Maieſty wrote to his holineſſe, with an Elegie wherein he makes the diſcourſe of his life. Once more I earneſtly intreate your fatherhood, as much as poſſibly remaines in me, that by no meanes you will let ſlip ſo notable an occaſion, well worthy to carry his deſeruing talent, and that in perſon you would manage a matter of ſuch importance: which, beſide imploring the ſtrong arme of the King, and the fauor of all Princes, hath neceſſarily need of the aſſiſtance of all loyal Portuguezes. For what account of himſelfe, can the reuerend father Frier Ioſeph Texere render to the world, ſo firme and conſtant a louer of his countrey? What excuſe can he alleadge, though there may be many, for not giuing furtherance to this affaire? Will he incur the infamie of N. who for his offences ſhould be ſeene that this king doth liue? What hath your fatherhood done againſt the kingdome, that you ſhould not preſent your ſelfe before all the world with plaine and open

lookes? Oh, for the loue of God, I beſeech you conſider in your ſoule, with what ſincere affection I vſe this language to you: I truſt God him ſelfe will illuminate your reuerend vnderſtanding, to behold how deare an intereſt you haue in this cauſe. From Venice the xii. of October 1600.
            
               
                  The ſeruant and brother to your fatherhood Frier Stephen de Sampayo.

                     SIR,
                  
                  I am extremely aſtoniſhed, being the man that you are, and ſo well knowne for a Portugueſe, that you ſhould at anie time couet anie thing more, then the freedome of Portugall; that you make ſo ſmall account of this incredible maruell, concerning the king Dom Sebaſtian, the only prize of all that kingdomes beſt aduentures, conſidering it is now ſo manie yeares ſince, that you employed yourſelfe in this buſineſſe, with no ſmall ſeruice vnto the ſaid Lord. You haue ſeene the whole diſcourſe along of this matter, by letters as well from my ſelfe as others, and becauſe the former which I writ vnto you, were but briefly handled, as committing what remained ouerplus to better leiſure, I am now determined (for diuerſe good reſpectes) to touch more largely, yet as briefly as I can, the verie foundation and ground of the whole worke.
                  The King Dom Sebaſtian, who in the yeare 1578. loſt himſelfe in the battell of Affricke (he whom the enemie cals a Ca

is the verie ſame priſoner which is now detained here: euen as certainly as you are Frier Ioſeph, and my ſelfe Dom Iohn. He departed ſafe and aliue from the battell, but verie ſore woū
                     ded; God hauing ſo deliuered him, with ſome other of his companie, among whom was the Duke of Aueyro. And hauing gone the better part of the world, about the end of his peregrination, he reſolued to liue priuate in an Hermitage; where after ſome time paſſed, he was inſpired by God, that he ſhould returne again
                        •
                      to Portugall to gouerne his kingdome. The ſelfe ſame inſpiration was likewiſe giuen to an Hermite, in the companie of whom he 
                        •
                     ad liued: which Hermite reuealed many things very ſecret to him touching this matter: for which cauſe he departed from the place where he abode, to accompliſh what the Spirit of God had inſpired and enioyned him to.
                  So he arriued in Sicilie, in the yeare 1598. where he entertained foure or fiue ſeruants (for he went before without companie) with whom he embarked himſelfe at Meſſina, in a Galley belonging to his Holineſſe, to 
                        〈◊〉

                     omewhat on him for the honor of God. This miſhap made him alter his former purpoſe; and th
                        •
                      poore miſerable man was glad to trace all Italie, in hope to find the theeues that had thus deſpoiled him. In the end, hearing no tidings at all of them, he retired to this Citie, the aboue named yeare, in the moneth of Iune, hauing about him but one poore Gazete, a peece of mony valuing three Liards of France. In this maner he lodged at a needie wretched houſe, where he remained ſome dayes not being knowne. Afterward, diuerſe particularly began to liſten after him: for they heard that he called himſelfe firſt a Knight of the Croſſe, and then afterward, the King Dom Sebaſtian. As this brute ran abrode, Antonio de Brito Pimentel, Pantaleon Peſſoa, and many others came oftentimes to ſee him at his lodging: and by occaſion of this rumour, which ſpread it ſelfe more and more through the Citie, chaunging his lodging, he fell by misfortune into the hands of vile men, which

being but verie bare themſelues, yet gaue him clothes and food at their charges. He got verie euill reputation by the companie of ſuch people, which was the principal cauſe or his ſtrange miſaduenture. He was with thoſe companions at Padoa, whereof this Seigneurie being aduertiſed by the Ambaſſador of Caſtille, and of ſome tumults made among them: to foreſtall ſuch inconueniences as might enſue, they ſent to the Podeſtat of Padoa, that he ſhould by cōmandement cauſe him to auoid the Towne within certaine houres, and by like certaine dayes to depart the places belonging to their Eſtate.
                  Hereupon for ſome ſpeciall reaſons beſt knowne to himſelf, he returned againe vnto this Citie, where the Seigneurs thereof at the inſtance of the ſaid Ambaſſadour (who aſſured them that he was but a thiefe and a ſeductour, prouing it by the teſtimony of Iewiſh merchants Portugueſes, and other perſons of ſelfſame honeſt qualitie, who tooke their oathes he was not the King Sebastian, becauſe the true King died in the battell of Affricke, neither did he reſemble him in any degree, imputing to him many and verie enormous crimes) they ſent to apprehend him, and as a malefactour committed him to verie cloſe impriſonment: notwithſtanding, there were many perſons both before and ſince his commitment, that had knowne him verie well in Portugall, and affirmed him to be the true king Dom Sebaſtian.
                  
                  At his firſt queſtioning withall, he declared to the Lords his miſhap in Affrica, and in what maner God had deliuered him. After, to diuerſe others he did the like, and perceiuing they would ſearch into all his ſecrets, yet vſing him verie hardly, being a King, and one that had no way preiudiced their eſtate: vpon his naturall and wonted inclination to choler, moued in a ſubiect of ſuch iuſtice and equitie, he refuſed to make them anie more direct anſwers, but one while ſaid one thing, then againe another; neuertheleſſe, he euermore maintained him ſelfe to be the true king Dom Sebaſtian, deſiring the Lords therein to beleeue him, and if they approued him not to be the ſame▪ then to chaſtiſe him iuſtly as a falſe deceiuer, which as yet to this inſtant they would neuer do, nor yet permit him to be ſeene by any.
                  He is in a certaine priſon, where no man may enter or ſpeake to the priſoners: neither may one write vnto him, on perill of

the ſaylours life, if he ſhould but conſent thereto. He hath endured verie great pouerties, and paſſed through many hard trauerſes: being no leſſe reproched and miſpriſed, then the baſeſt priſoners with him. His life is very religious, addicted altogether to prayer and faſting, feeding but on bread & water moſt dayes in the weeke. And yet notwithſtanding this auſtere abſtinence, he is verie ſtrong, as I haue heard by one of the priſoners releaſed out of that priſon: who departed thence greatly affectionate to him, ſeeming to loue him highly, and reported matters maruellous of his ſtrength and other good parts.
                  As for the exteriour markes of his bodie, he wants not one of them which he had when as he raigned: the ſelfe ſame lip, looke, head, bodie, armes, thighes, legges and feete, not fayling of anie one marke which he had naturally (imprinted as it were) on his perſon. He is wounded on the brow of the right eye, and on the head, as many witneſſed, when they ſaw him in the Affricke battell: he hath abundance of great wounds on his armes and legges: he ſpeakes Portugall as mingled or corrupted, wherein he is not much to be blamed, conſidering he hath not ſpoken it in the ſpace of two and twentie yeares, according to the reſolution he tooke with his friends and companions, becauſe they might paſſe the better vnknowne. His hand writing is the ſelfe ſame, obſeruing ſtill the ſame maner and method; all which are verie well remembred by diuerſe, that haue both ſcene and knowne them in times paſt. In the ſecret notes of his bodie, there is none likewiſe wanting, albeit he haue many & very notable, as is iuſtified by good teſtimonie, approued by the publike Notaries of Portugall. It is impoſſible to find another man in the world, that ſhould haue all the ſelfe ſame markes, and it ſeemes that God had thus ſigned him from the wombe of his mother, with ſo manie rare and ſignall markes, to make him knowne (by meanes of them) in ſo vnhappie and miſerable a time, euen as he hath likewiſe preſerued him for the fulfilling of ſo great and auncient Propheſies, which haue ſo copiouſly ſpoken of him. May it pleaſe God but to permit, that the proſperities in the accompliſhment yet remaining to him, may aunſwer in like certaintie to the foretold aduerſities, which he hath paſſed alreadie.
                  
                     Things ſtanding in this eſtate, we haue demaunded audience of the Seigneurie, which twice hath bene graunted vs by the Senate with verie good will. And there we deliuering the rumor that ran abroad, of the impriſonment of our King Dom Sebaſtian, by meanes wherereof all Portugall was moued, and all Chriſtendom held it for meruellous and ſtrange: we requeſted that he might be ſeene and knowne, and if he were found to be the true King Dom Sebaſtian, that he might be ſo held and eſteemed of euerie one. If vpon their ſuffering him, to be thus queſtioned and ſeen by vs, we returned and auouched him to be the ſame, we would ſubmit our ſelues to ſuch impriſonment as they thought meet, and ſuffer what puniſhment they would pleaſe to appoint, if herein we diſſembled or dealt falſe with them. Before theſe audiences could be obtained, we offered them a Charter in parchment, whereby we gaue them to vnderſtand, that we deſired no other grace or fauour, but what hath beene graunted in the like caſe by Philip. 2. King of Caſtille (he hauing more intereſt in this matter then they) about two Portuguezes, who in Portugall did feigne themſelues ſeuerally to be the true King D. Sebaſtian, he cauſed them to be kept in a publique priſon, where all the world might haue ſeene and ſpoken with them, to the end that they might not be abuſed by them, and they were ſoone found to be villaines and deceiuers, whereby the Portuguezes were quickly reſolued.
                  We required moreouer, that good order might be taken for his diet, and that his perſon ſhould be ſafely regarded, while this affaire were further proceeded in, leaſt his enemies might compaſſe his death by poiſon: for if anie ſuch thing ſhould ſo come to paſſe, the Portuguezes would report continually, that the Seigneurie of Venice had murdered their proper, naturall, lawful and true King, when it ſhould plainly appeare that he was no Calabrois, -whence would ariſe ſuch ill will betweene the Portuguezes and the Venetians, as the Seigneuries name ſhould for euer be ſcandalized through the world. See here the ſubſtance of all that we could doe, yet we continued ſtill in our right, with all the diligence we could poſſibly vſe, calling neuer for anie other thing then iuſtice. And as we grew great in the poore opinion of our hopes, Diego Manuel chanced to arriue there, by whoſe comming we were ſomewhat more

comforted, perſwading our ſelues now to obtaine thorowly what we deſired: becauſe he had brought letters of great importance, which mainly might ſet forward our earneſt ſute. And to ſtrengthen vs yet more, Sebaſtian Figuera came hither likewiſe the 4. of this moneth, with letters from the States in general of Holland, & from the Prince Maurice vnto the Seigneurie, in fauour of the King Dom Sebaſtian, which were deliuered on the morrow, for the Lords had appointed vs to be heard againe as that daie.
                  Now aduiſe your ſelfe very well, whether I haue reaſon or no to thinke ſtrangely of you, and to expect your preſence here for obtaining of this glorie, wherein you haue ſo ſeriouſly trauailed vntil this day. If you haue any remēbrance of heauen, or anie high and generous ſpirit, here haue you a ſubiect meet to employ it in. I beleeue you reſerue to your ſelf the ſur-name of a Portugueze, for nothing but to ioyne it only with that of Texere. This ſhould be the hidden treaſure, whereof in the end of the yeare 1598. you called to the finding your good friend the knight Buodo, when you made your paſſage into Holland. If you be deſirous of glorie and happineſſe, we ſhall ſoone haue you here: deuide your ſelfe in peeces for the Prince, and you ſhall find the effects thereof in the mercies of God. In ſooth I know not how you haue abſtained from comming barefoote hither, conſidering how zealous you haue beene for the good and profite of our countrie; and ſuch a profeſſed enemie beſide to the Spaniard; and (in times paſt) of high courage for vndertaking of anie worthie attempt; ſeeing (vnder heauen) is not the like caſe as here offers vnto you; beſides, being free for whoſoeuer to embrace. Awake your ſpirites either now or neuer, and ſeeing you haue ſo much credite in thoſe parts, pray, importune your friends in any place whereſoeuer, and if you may, obtaine letters from his moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie, the famous Queene of England, the generall States of Holland, and from all the Princes and Lords of France: that this Seigneurie may ſuffer the priſoner to be known what he is, true or falſe, or at leaſt to enlarge him, becauſe to this houre they will neither let him be knowne nor ſeene: but faile not to come, with what fauours you can compaſſe. And ſay that deniall herein maybe made vnto you, yet you muſt not ſlack your comming in a buſines ſo expedient: for you ſhall do no mean ſeruice to your Prince, as you haue done

heretofore and that verie notably, and had we but your preſence here, we ſhould hold it ſufficient.
                  Doe not let fall to ground ſo great an aduenture, ſeeing you haue done ſo much alreadie for a ſhadow, and giue the like counſell vnto your friends; for neuer can hap like occaſion to this. On one ſide the enterpriſe is put into your hand, on the other the recompence: doe like a defender of your countrie, and your merite ſhall be more then following times can acknowledge. Notwithſtanding, let me thus condition with you, that you ſhall not be ſo couetous a louer of your ſelfe, as to make a ſole benefite of the honour in this action, but to diuide ſome participation thereof to your friends.
                  I had forgot to tell you that the priſoner hath had of the Siegneurie, fiue crownes of this mony monethly to diſpend, which is a little more then foure crownes of the Sunne; of which he giues away the moſt part to the poore for the honour of God. I once more intreate you to haſte your affaires with what breuitie you may, and as you come, giue copies of this letter to ſo manie as ſhal require it, for I will ſend the ſame to as manie others as I write vnto. You ſhall doe me a ſingular pleaſure, in making my commendations to M. de Tiron, and tell him, that this is the meruaile whereof I had talke with him ſo manie yeeres ſince, and let him make account to be as certain of my ſeruice, as his merites do iuſtly challenge. And to Monſieur le Commaundeur de Chastes, ſay that the time is now come wherein I ſhall make knowne to him how much I reſt engaged and am readie at his ſeruice. And ſo pleaſe him to credite me: if he deſire to purchaſe ſupreme glorie and great eſtate, let his employment be intire on this Princes behalfe, for thereby he ſhall gaine more honor and repute, then his higheſt thoughts is able to imagin I kiſſe the hāds of al our friends according to my dutie, and let each one receiue me as effectually his. Our Lord giue you vnderſtanding of all I haue writ vnto you, with happie and proſperous ſuceſſe in your trauaile. From Venice the 6. of Nouember 1600. humblie kiſſing your hands.
                  
                     The moſt affectionate to your ſeruice, Dom Iohn de Caſtro.
                  
               
            
            
               This Dom Iohn de Caſtro, whom I thinke your reuerend Lordſhip knowes verie wel, hath euer held this opinion; that the king Dom Sebaſtian was ſtill aliue, and that Portugall ſhould one day be reſtored by him. He tooke it for a matter ſo firme and certaine, that in the yeere 1596. when I was at Folambray, about ſome affaires belonging to mine order and my ſelfe, the King beſieging la Fere, he iuſtified it in the Chapter houſe of our couent of Iacobines at Paris, to diuers Portuguezes (perſwading them neuer to accord with D. Philip. 2. King of Caſtille, neither euer to goe togither) for he knew aſſuredly that the King Dom Sebaſtian liued, & that Portugal would be reſtored within few yeeres; ſaying moreouer, that he eſteemed it for a matter ſo certaine, as he durſt maintaine it vpon his oath. Hereupon, ſo ſoone as he heard that the King Dom Sebaſtian was kept priſoner at Venice, he could not anie waie remaine in quiet. Immediatly he made his voiage for England, to intreate the royall Queene to fauour and further this caſe: from England he went to Holland, for the ſelfe ſame purpoſe, and being returned to Faris, he neuer ceaſed till he came to 
                  Ʋenice, where he arriued the 28. of Iune laſt paſt, and his voyage was of ſuch importance, as we hope it will ſerue ſufficiciently to get his King at libertie.
            
               An anſwere to the fift demand.
               The perſons that procured the libertie of my Lord Dom Sebaſtian king of Portugall, are theſe following. The father doctor de Sampayo, regent in the facultie of Theologie at Toloſſa, whom your worthie Lordſhip doth know verie wel. He in the ſeruice of the ſaid King, aduentured his life in verie great hazard, paſſing ſecretly into Portugall, and managed the matter wish ſuch dexteritie, as it was poſſible for anie man whatſoeuer to do. A doctor of the order of Saint Bernard, named Frier Chryſoſtome, a verie religious man, & (as I haue heard) of good credit and authoritie. Dom Iohn de Caſtro before named, the ſonne to Dom Aluaro de Caſtro, who was one of the 4. gouernours that ruled the kingdome, coniointly with the King Dom Sebaſtian, thoſe whom we call in Portugal, Ʋeadores de la hazienda, & grand child to Dom Iohn de Caſtro, hertofore viceroy in the Eaſt Indies: of whoſe high proweſſes, worthie deeds of arms & victories, our hiſtories giue no mean

commendation. A Chanon of Lisbon, a man of noble lignage and rich, who abandonning his countrie, and forſaking his goods, departed expreſſely from Portugall on this reſpect: and brought the markes which the ſaid king hath on his bodie, approoued by authenticall inſtruments of a Notarie Apoſtolique. Rodrigo Marques, Diego Manoel, and Sebaſtian Figuera, which three were ſeruants to the king Dom Antonio, namely companions in the ſame fortune. The laſt is he of whom we haue made mention in the ſecond anſwer, and the ſame whom Dom Iohn de Caſtro ſaith in his letter, to arriue at Venice, with letters from the generall States of the vnited Prouinces, and the Prince Maurice.
               
               It hath bene told me, that they expect at Venice the Lord Dom Chriſtophero, youngeſt ſonne to the king Dom Antonio, who is at Rome, and with him theſe Lords Manuel de Brito Pimentel, Pantaleon Peſſoa de Neyua, Frances Antoine, and other Gentlemen of Portugall, of whom I can ſay nothing what they are, becauſe their names were not written to me. The newes that I haue at this preſent, are no other then thoſe contained in the ſaid letters from the Doctor de Sampayo, and from Dom Iohn de Caſtro, from each of whom I haue receiued diuerſe other, which neuertheleſſe ſort all to one ſelfe ſame end. There be ſundrie other letters here from other Portuguezes, that affirme this man to be the true king of Portugall Dom Sebaſtian, and approoue it for truth by many reaſons, giuing ſuch plaine apparance of veritie, that (according to humane iudgement) cannot be encountred or ratified on any other then himſelfe. So that I ſee nothing which may call me into doubt of his not being the ſame man, for otherwiſe he muſt queſtionleſſe be a ſpirit or diuell: which cannot be, conſidering his life is ſo holy and perfect, his proceeding moſt ſimple▪ and (to vſe the very ſame words which one hath written to me) it is all meere ſimplicitie. If he were a ſeductour, or an euill ſpirit, he would expreſſe ſtore of artificiall crafts and frauds in his doings: beſide, a wicked ſpirit would neuer endure ſo long and rigorous an impriſonment. The aforenamed aduertiſements, inſtances and intreates from the ſpecified perſons, beſide reaſon it ſelfe, bind me (moſt worthie Sir) to part thus briefly, but I hope to viſite you againe to morrow after breakefaſt: and ſo I cloſe vp mine anſwer to your fift demaund.
            
            
               
               An anſwer to the ſixt and laſt demaund.
               For anſwer to the ſixt and laſt demaund, I ſay (right reuerend Lord) that it is to me very much diſpleaſing, to ſerue as a Confeſſour in this buſineſſe, and by that meanes ſtand bound to keepe all vnder ſeale: for this reaſon I dare not anſwer categorically, becauſe I feare to offend my moſt inward wel-willers in their truſt. Notwithſtanding, that I may induce the king of Portugall Dom Sebaſtian my Lord into Fraunce, I promiſe to make the mightie truth ſo apparant, that it ſhall violently breake the very ſtrongeſt bars oppoſed againſt it, and ouerflow the whole earth, that with much glorie and proſperitie it may floate through al the Septentrion, and grace him home into his owne kingdome.
               When the Portugals ſhall haue their beſt loued & deſired king at libertie: who ſhall offer reſiſtance? If Sir, you reply to me, demaunding how I dare aſſume ſuch confidence in this caſe of Sebaſtian, ſeeing (in late proofe) we could not do any act of great importance, when we had Dom Antonio preſent with vs: I anſwer, that to iuſtifie my words▪ I haue a thouſand reaſons that make for me. There was great difference betweene Sebaſtian and Antonio. Antonio came to the Crowne by a very great hazard and difficultie: Sebaſtian from the wombe of his mother was borne Prince & heire. Antonio employed his time to gouerne and viſite the churches of his Priour de Crato (he was grand Prior of Malta in Portugall, and for this reſpect, Lord ſpirituall and temporall of thirteene cities, and more then foure hundred villages:) Sebaſtian vſed to manage his horſes, and follow the exerciſe of armes. Antonio, as a man Eccleſiaſticall and regular, kept his ſword ruſting in the ſcabberd: Sebaſtian like one ſecular and a King, caried his daily naked, ſhining brighter then chriſtall. To confirme what I ſay, me ſeemes (worthie Sir) that it is not neceſſarie to alleage all the reaſons which offer themſelues: it ſufficeth vs to know for certaine, that the king Dom Sebaſtian hath at this day, and euermore had the will and hart of a Portugueze, which is as firme in ſeeking his ſubiects benefite and loue, as it was euer readie with his weapon to encounter his enemie.
               The Portuguezes know very well, that they haue alreadie felt for the ſpace of 21. yeares, one moneth, and 25. daies, the hony & ſweet reliſh of his gouernment, & that if they haue in all the paſſed

time, taſted any thing vnſauorie in his actions (becauſe he was a little ſtiffe and ſharpe:) they haue ſince then bene ſo ouer-glutted with gall, as they will find his very bittereſt behauiour, more ſugred and ſweete then the others beſt taſt. Moreouer, if there be great difference betweene man and man: euen ſo on the other ſide is there betweene time and time. The Portuguezes liue at this day, with an vnquenchable thirſt of their libertie, ſo that they would gladly caſt themſelues from the tops of high mountaines, to find a redreſſe for their ſlauiſh bondage. In the paſſed time, as they had neuer taſted but their owne naturall gouernment, ſo they knew not how to prooue the bitter, nor how well to eſteem the benefite of the ſweete. Hence grew ſo many parts taking, both before and after the election of Dom Antonio. He had with him the people, the Lords of the familie of Vimieuſe and others, with the moſt part of the eccleſiaſticall and regular perſons. The duke of Bragancia, he brought in his quarter many Lords of Portugall (for they were almoſt all deſcended of his houſe) and their followers, which made neare the number of two hundred thouſand in Portugall. The Nobles of Portugall, which are there called Eſcuyers or Cheualliers d'vne Launce, & are the principall ſtrength and ſinewes of the Realme, they betooke themſelues all to ſee the ſport of this play. The fourth part, which held for his Catholike Maieſtie D. Philip king of Caſtile, becauſe of the diſcord and deuiſion of the reſt, was the ſtrongeſt, & proceeded at more pleaſure in thoſe affaires. There was but one ſole part with the King Sebaſtian, and to him they continued ſtill vnited firme: for it is a thing very publique, and knowne through the world, that the Portuguezes not only loued Dom Sebaſtian as their king, but honoured him as if he had bene a God. Wherefore (worthie Lord) I hold it for moſt certain, that ſo ſoone as they ſhould vnderſtand their King to be in France, they would immediatly ſhake off the yoake of Caſtile, they would ſend him mony to ſupply his neceſſities, and would leauy an armie by ſea, with whom they would gladly come to ſeeke him, and no bodie could tell which way to hinder them, for they are in poſſeſſion, and hold all Portugall and his Monarchie properly in their hands.
               His Maieſtie Catholique holds nothing in Portugall which he can warrant or defend: for what can three or foure hundred ſouldiers

do within the caſtle of Lisbon, when for defence of the ſame there ſhall need 10000. There is in this Caſtle a Pariſh that holds more then 500. houſes or make-fires, this caſtle was the pallace of our Kings, builded on a mountain all of earth, ſubiect to vndermining & blowing vp. His ſaid Maieſtie keeps his Garriſon therin to no other end, but only for oſtentation: I my ſelfe was priſoner in it 3. moneths and a halfe, in the yeare 1582. after the death of the Lord of Strozzi, & I haue heard Captains ſay, that if 10. thouſand ſouldiers were in it, they would make them dance out therof in a moment, & mockt ſuch as eſteemed it for a ſafe ſecuritie, if any rumor or tumult ſhould be blown through the citie. His Catholike Maieſtie holds as impregnable the Tower of Bethlehem on the ſea, for guard of the port a league from Lisbon; at three leagues that of S. Iohn; at 4. that of S. Anthonie; at 5. that of Caſcayes. In the firſt, third, & fourth, there is not aboue 100. men of war: in the ſecond, of S. Iohn, admit there were more then 400. whoſoeuer is or ſhall be Lord of the land, ſhall be ſo likewiſe very eaſily of al thoſe towers. But ſay that S. Iohns is mighty & ſtrong: I know for certaintie, that the 16. part of Prince Maurice his A. B. C. were enough to race & batter it in 4. houres. (This A. B. C. are 24. Canons, which the Prince Maurice cauſed to be made for the batterie of Stenwick, & tooke it perforce in the yere, 1592.)
               Moreouer, his Maieſtie Catholike hath an other Tower, which his father cauſed to be made in the middeſt of the ſea on a rocke, which is called Teſte ſeche: this tower ſerues to no end, but that the other of S. Iohns doth countenance it. At Setuball ſixe leagues frō Lisbon, there is alſo at entrance of the port a tower called S. Philip, of very ſlender importance, by being built at the foote of a high mountaine that commands it. I thinke beſides theſe, at the port of Viana, ſixtie leagues from Lisbon, he keeps a Garriſon of Spaniards in another tower: behold here the ſtrength of his Maieſtie Catholike in Portugall. But of what import will they prooue, though he had much more aduantage, if the Portugals were counited & cōbined together? ſo much the ſooner enſued his loſſe.
               
                  Dom Iohn king of Caſtile the firſt of that name, called himſelfe king of Portugal in the right of his wife, who was daughter to D. Fernand king of Portugall; the Queene mother, her kindred and allies, did likewiſe take part with the Caſtillians: but the Portuguezes knitting them ſelues in an vnity together, rent forth of his

hands whatſoeuer he had inſulted on, and chaſed him out of the kingdome, after they had ouerthrowne him in the battell of Aljibarota: albeit he had in his army foure and thirty thouſand men, and they were but 7. thouſand onely: afterward, they gaue him defiance againe at Valverde, at Trancoſo, and elſewhere, as is to be ſeene in our hiſtories (if your reuerend ſelfe but pleaſe to reade, you ſhall there find it agreeing with my words) and in purſuite they gaue him law at their owne pleaſure, as anon we ſhall tell you more in this anſwere.
               Thus we may eaſily perceiue, that it conſiſts not in the ſtrengh of the king Catholicke Dom Philip, both to guard Portugall, and keepe all the kingdome thereof vnder bridle, though he aſſembled all Spaine, and all his other commaund. Wherefore I am of the mind (moſt worthy Lord) that ſo ſoone as his Maieſty Catholicke is giuen to vnderſtand, how that the King Dom Sebaſtian is come into Fraunce, he will immediatly ſend his Embaſſadours to him, and offer him the reintegration of his realme in quiet (ſwept cleane already of corne and chaffe) as much as to ſay, as without pretending any thing to him but loue and kindneſſe. And I thinke his Councel wil therto aduiſe him, if they haue any feare of God, if they be wiſe, diſcreet, or friends to the ſeruice & welfare of their king. For if king Sebaſtian come with ſtrong hand to the reſtauration of Portugall, no way can hinder him the entrance of Portugall, then into Caſtile, and from thence through all Sapine, whereby he will bring Dom Philip into ſuch diſtreſſe, as doubtleſſe he will go neare to make ruine of all. And when he ſhall come to vrge his agreement, Dom Sebaſtian not onely will bind him to pay all his diſpence, domages and wrongs endured by occaſion of the warre: but likewiſe to reſtore him thoſe reuenues and profits, which the king his father and himſelfe haue hald out of Portugall, for the ſpace of more then twenty yeares, which will amount to more then forty millions. Nay, that which is more, to deſtroy him, and be gratefull to his friends, and them that aided him in the recouerie of his kingdome: he will conſtraine him to render the realme of Nauarre to the king moſt Chriſtian: that of Aragon to the Duke of Lorraine, thoſe of Naples and Sicilie to his holineſſe, and likewiſe to the other Princes of Europe, all that he hath held from them perforce; for the

flower they are in comming to peace and concord, the ſwifter enſues the great loſſe and miſhap of Spaine.
               This which I ſay reuerend Sir, is not in bare and ſimple words onely, nor ſhall this be the firſt time, that Portugall hath taught law to Caſtile: ſuch as are pleaſed in reading hiſtories, ſhall find this very true, and of many that we might report and ſet downe in account, we will alleadge but onely one. Dom Peter King of Caſtile, ſirnamed the cruell (who was ſlaine by his baſtard brother, that came to raigne afterward, and named himſelfe Henry the II.) left two daughters, the firſt called Conſtance, the ſecond Iſabel, wife to Edmond of Langley brother to Iohn of Gaunt, the husband to the elder daughter Conſtance, of whom was borne a daughter named Catharine. The ſayd Iohn of Gaunt, in the regard of his wife Conſtance, qualified the king of Caſtile and Leon, and made his direct paſſage from Gaſcoigne (which then was in the rule of the Engliſh) into Spaine, with eighteene thouſand foote, and two thouſand horſe, and tooke the Groigne, with the ayde of Iohn the baſtard, elected King of Portugall, receiued, ſworne, confirmed, and obeyed by the Portuguezes, who were to him very good friends. Thence he went on to Portugall, whence he entred into Caſtile, and ſo on to the City of Burgos, diſtant from the place where he parted more then twentie ſixe leagues: tooke it at his arriuall, and made himſelfe maiſter of all the cities, townes and caſtles he came to: moreouer, they that were further off, came and for feare ſubmitted themſelues. And eaſily had he attained to a larger aduantage, but that his men died, who through their neglect in ordering thēſelues, and ſmall prouidence in good husbandry, were ouertaken by famine, whereon a peſtilence enſued among thē, and they were brought to ſuch ſcarſity of victuals, as they were forced to run to the enemies campe, which was vnder the guide of Lewes Duke of Bourbon, who in fauor of king Iohn of Caſtile, came thither well accōpanied with the Frēch, to requeſt wherewithal to ſaue their liues. Which the ſayd Iohn of Portugall beholding, complained to the Duke, ſaying, that it was not good for his ſouldiers to treate with the enemy, affirming that they would cauſe more preiudice then all the other: therefore he ſhould repeale them preſently, & forbid all community of ſpeech with the contrary part. Otherwiſe when they ſhould enter fight,

all would by the edge of the ſword be deſtroyed, the one in regard of loue to the other. Thomas Walſingham an Engliſh hiſtorian, deliuers it in the ſelfe ſame termes, and ſayth, that the king of Portugall had with him foure thouſand Portuguezes, and all of them very well armed.
               Within few dayes after, certaine Embaſſadors ſent by the king of Caſtile, came to the Duke, deſiring peace of him in all humility, to whom the Duke wold giue no audience, Notwithſtanding, the hunger & peſtilēce did enforce him, to withdraw thēce into Portugall to the towne of Trancoſo, whither they came againe ſeeking to him, being ſent the ſecond time from the ſaid Iohn king of Caſtile, & to vrge once more the ſame requeſt: ſhewing the Duke by many reaſons, the great profit might be drawne out of a kind peace betweene them. The Duke then gaue them the hearing, & condiſcended to their demand, although it was greatly againſt his will; chiefly, becauſe he heard that the king hf Portugall was willing thereto, and then (being touched therein by a more effectuall cauſe) namely, the intelligēce of the troubles beginning in France among the French and Engliſh, and ſome ſeditions at home in England: all which ſhewed him, that he could draw no freſh ſupplies thence, becauſe that there ſeemed to be greater need, and the mortality in his army did moſt of all require it.
               The accord betweene the King and the Duke was made in this manner. That Henrie eldeſt ſonne to King Iohn, named Prince of Caſtile, ſhould eſpouſe Catherine the onely daughter of the ſayd Duke Iohn of Gaunt, and Conſtance his wife, and ſhould ſucceed in the kingdomes of Caſtile, Leon, and other Seigneuries: that the king ſhould endowe the mother and daughter, and ſo he did: giuing to the mother the citie of Guadalajata, Medina del Campo and Olmiedo: afterward, being with her in the ſayd Medina, he gaue her likewiſe Hueta. To the daughter he gaue the Eſturies, creating and naming her Princeſſe, and his ſonne Prince thereof. So from thence forward, the eldeſt ſonne euer bare the ſirname of this principalitie: as of Daulphinies in Fraunce, of Wales in England, of Girona in Aragon, of Vienna in Nauarre, &c. Moreouer, he ſhould giue the Duke ſixe hundreth thouſand Franckes of gold, for his returne into England, and fortie thouſand Franckes in name of rent, beſide the ſayd

cities and townes during the liues of him an her.
               
                  Iohn of Caſtile accepted of all theſe conditions with right good will, yet he had Fraunce and the French on his ſide, and the King of Aragon (with whoſe ſiſter he was maried, of whom was borne the ſayd Prince Dom Henrie, and Fernand that after was king of Aragon, againſt the right of the true heires indeed) and Charles the III. king of Nauarre his brother: but he knew notwithſtanding all theſe, that hauing ciuill wars in Caſtile, and Portugall for an enemy, fortune wold forſake him in all his realmes & Seigneuries. Thus could and can the kingdome of Portugall beare head againſt the reſt of Spaine. It is moſt certaine, that at all times, and as often as Portugall hath the fauour of Fraunce, of England, or ſome other ſtraunge Prince whoſoeuer it be, it compels the king of Caſtile (to whom that is a bridle) to make him yeeld to reaſon, and come at commaund, nay, to accept of conditions very ignominious and preiudiciall. And thoſe of the Duke might haue bene much more aduantageable to this agreement, if the king of Portugall had bene willing: becauſe hauing the ſword in his hand, he might haue cut out his partage at his owne pleaſure. He was the Iudge, and it was done with his will: Qui habet gladium, poteſt diuidere campos. And hence it came, that the Duke departed not very well contented with him: although he gaue him in mariage his eldeſt daughter Philippe.
               
               By this already rehearſed (worthy Lord) may be vnderſtood, that they who haue not the pearles of ſpotted affection in their eyes, may diſcerne, and others, whoſe harts are not fatted with hate to this good king, may know, that my wordes are neither bourdings nor ſongs. For if this King Dom Iohn the baſtard, hauing all Spaine, all Fraunce, and ſome of Caſtile his allies banding againſt him, for himſelfe only foure thouſand Portuguezes, and ſome Engliſh in weake eſtate, and yet then ſuſpected to, being withdrawne from Caſtile into Portugall, could make lawes to his enemies: what ſhall Sebaſtian do, accompanied with a great number of Princes of Europe, with his Portuguezes and his owne perſon, which degenerates not a iot from that of his graundfather Dom Iohn the baſtard, who for his faire deedes was ſirnamed, Of worthy memory: againſt a young king, ſlenderly experimented, and but badly armed? It is not to be doubted but he

ſhall reſtore Portugall, ſeeing God and the propheſies haue ſo made him promiſe; and that he ſhall cleanſe and purge the Spaniards of their vices and abuſes, according as S. Iſidore hath propheſied, who ſince he floriſhed, it is more then a thouſand yeres. What contentment, what ioy ſhall the world receiue by ſight hereof, and namely they that are the children of God? What felicitie for the Romane Church? What good for the weale publike of Chriſtendome? Let the enemie iudge this cauſe, and (as one ſaid in Portugall) let them cracke this nut, and know, that yet at this daye Portugall is farre ſtronger then Spaine, yea all Spaine in the time of the ſaid Baſtard. Then all that were ſouldiers, were skilful in handling the ſword, the launce, the halbard and the croſſe or long bow: now at this day they can not be drawne from the harquebuſe or musket; for this reaſon the Portugals haue yet more ſouldiers then Spaine. Becauſe the Caſtilians, yea or the Spaniards that come from the garriſons of the king of Caſtile, do neuer part thence but lame and maimed, except it be ſome of the principal Gentlemen. Of the Portugueſes ſent from Portugall to the Eaſt Indies, there comes backe commonly the third part of them, and of them that are ſcattered in diuerſe places of Affricke the ſecond part. This is moſt certaine, for in the beginning of the raigne of our Lord D. Antonio, I found a rolle of the ſouldiers that were to be had in Portugall, wherein it was aſſured me, that within the prouince d'Entre, Douro and Migno, which is called in Latine Interamnis, which containes no more then eighteene leagues in length, & twelue in breadth at the moſt, three thouſand old ſouldiers were to be found.
               To this aunſwere, it remaines for me yet to ſatisfie another obiection, which your reuered ſanctitie may make vnto me, to wit, Some that haue a mightie opinion of the King of Caſtilles ſtrength, would make the world beleeue, that he is infinitely powerfull, and can inuade Portugall with huge numbers of ſouldiers. To the firſt point I aunſwere briefely and ſuccinctly: That the King of Caſtille is in no place more weake then in Spaine. To the ſecond: Whence ſhall hee gather ſuch ſupplies of ſouldiours? Shall hee furniſh him ſelfe out of thoſe garriſons and forces which hee hath from Spaine? Not ſo.

If in caſe he will cull out of the ſaid garriſons ſome ſouldiers to forrage Portugall, hee muſt at the leaſt haue foure moneths time to do it. In leſſe then foure dayes may men paſſe frō Brittanie to Lisbone. Could he bring fiftie thouſand men into Portugall, wherewithall wil he feed them? I would onely twentie thouſand. Moreouer, what would auaile fiftie thouſand ſoldiers in Portugal? All thoſe being there, could not impeach the King Don Sebaſtian from landing: for Portugall hath an hundred and fortie leagues on the coaſt, and throughout is landing eaſily to be had. In ſome parts, they that are on land in one place cannot in a day giue ſuccour to the other, albeit they are diſtant but two leagues. If king Sebaſtian did but ſet foote on land, all Portugall would preſently run to him: by which reaſon, ſtrange ſouldiers would be forced to yeeld themſelues, or throw themſelues headlong into the ſea, or die with famine, or elſe by the hands of their enemies.
               Now giue I concluſion to this preſent diſcourſe, humbly beſeeching your worthie Lordſhip, to hold excuſed ſuch ſlips as are therein, becauſe in the writing thereof, I haue bene driuen to ſome nightly houres (which could not be verie manie ſince I receiued your laſt letter) for ſo long a certification by pen, and but that I was enioyned thereto by your expreſſe commaund, I could gladly haue excuſed my ſelfe from ſo tedious a trauel. But the honors and graces receiued from ſo worthie a perſon, haue bene ſo great, and continued in ſuch ſort, as they bound me to obey without all excuſe. If my pen haue erred in anie point (whereof I doubt not) this hope is left me, that one day I may giue your Lordſhip more ample, certaine & aſſured ſatisfaction, in all whatſoeuer ſhall pleaſe you to require. I write in the Caſtilian language, becauſe your worthie ſelfe did ſo commaund me, and in regard you take ſome delight therein, as it hath bene often told me. But ſhould I confeſſe the truth, my loue would much more haue forwarded me, & rather haue had me to write in my natiue Portugueſe. Our Lord gard and giue proſperity to a perſonage of ſuch honor.

               e Aldobrandino for my paſſage into Italie about affaires of mine Order, & ſome of mine owne in particular, with ſundrie letters of fauor for Venice, for Rome and other places: furniſhed with all things needfull for my voyage, I departed not till the 24, becauſe it was the euen of Chriſtmas, (I had receiued the 22. your Lordſhips letter, whereto I made no anſwer till the 6. and then gaue it to my Lord your nephew, who is not hence departed as yet.) And as I thought to depart on the Sonday after the feaſts, I could not do it, by reaſon we had intelligence, that on the way of Lions were disbanded ſouldiers of the Swizzers, who robbed and ill intreated all paſſengers. Hereupon, I made account to depart in the companie of my Lord Monſieur de Sancy, who trauelled to the Fort of S. Catherine. The ſaid Lord being hindred by his buſineſſes, made me to attend from day to day, till the Sonday following, the 7. of this inſtant: and yet our parting was put off frō Sonday to Monday. It ſeemes that God had ſo appointed it, to the end I ſhould not throw my ſelfe into danger, nor the incommodities of the ſeaſon, neither vndertake a iourney to no ende. For on the ſame Sonday, when we had reſolued without faile to depart thence, about the ſeuenth houre of night, I receiued letters from Venice, wherby I was aduertiſed, that the king of Portugal Don Sebaſtian my Lord, was ſet at liberty. And at the ninth houre of the ſame night, came a Gentleman to my lodging, one of my friends and acquaintance, with him a Page belonging to a Lord my friend likewiſe, carying a lighted torch; which Gentleman told me on the behalfe of the ſaid Lord, that he had alſo receiued letters from Venice, wherein were ſome newes that he deſired to acquaint me withall. I tooke my cloake, and went to ſee him in his lodging, where he confirmed to me the ſame tydings.

                  •
               oy, the contentment, and the deſire of this Princes arriuall

is ſo great, yea, in all perſons without anie difference, as if he were giuen as an onely remedie, to the trauailes and miſeries of this preſent age. And that it may proue ſo, if auncient propheſies deceiue vs not, all Chriſtendome hath reaſon to hope much, of proſperitie and welfare by the meanes of this holy King.
            The newes that I haue, how he was ſet at libertie, are theſe. After that the Portuguezes had obtained audience of the Senate, which the Lords granted them with benigne and readie will: Diego Manuell arriued there from France, and Sebaſtian Figuera from the States of Holland, with letters in fauour of this affaire, as elſewhere you haue heard before, and from Rome the Lord Dom Chriſtophero, with Manuel de Brito Pimentel, Pantaleon Peſſoa de Neyua, and Frances Antoine, with whom there ioyned manie Portugueſes more, that came from diuers parts. The eleuenth of this moneth paſt, the Lords entred into Councell (which they there terme Pregay) where commonly you ſhall haue two hundred Lords of the chiefeſt of that Seigneurie. The Pregay held for the ſpace of foure daies. On the laſt, which was the inſtant about ten of the clock in the night, the Lords concluded on their laſt reſolution in this caſe. They cauſed the priſoner to be brought, and commanded a Secretarie to ſet down this determination following.
            Becauſe he names himſelfe to be the King of Portugall Dom Sebaſtian, he is commanded out of this Citie within one day, and from the parts belonging to this Seigneurie within three daies more; on paine of commitment to the gallies for the ſpace of ten yeeres, with yron gyues at his feete. But if his indiſpoſition of bodie cannot ſuffer this paine: then he ſtands condemned to perpetual impriſonment. Moreouer, for puniſhment of his diſobedience committed, in not departing the lands belonging to the State at the time when by commaundement of the podeſtate of Padoa he was ſo enioyned, they had alreadie giuen him theſe two yeeres and 22. daies impriſonment, ſince the contempt.
            The ſentence pronounced, he was immediatly ſet at libertie; betweene eleuen and twelue of the clocke in the night. Some letters from certaine of Italie, ſpeaking in this manner, ſay: This was but a boxe of coriander comfites, to pleaſe the Spaniard withall, becauſe he is their neigbour: the gazetes affirme the ſame.

               zes would not ſuffer him, but deſired that he would diſcourſe to them ſome matter of his aduentures. Whereto he replied, that he would therein reſolue them an other time, in meane while, he requeſted them to pleaſure him ſo much, as to tell him ſome newes of his friends and countrie. Herevpon he began to enquire of Dom Iohn de Caſtro, concerning his brethren, his vncles and other kinred: of Dom Chriſtophero, for his brother Dom Emanuel. And after he had conferred a long while with him, well conſidering and noting his face and countenance: You reſemble very much Dom Antonio your father (quoth he to him) but I pray God giue you grace to reſemble in deedes your Grandfather the infant Dom Lewes Duke of Beja.
            
            Here we haue manie things (worthie Sir) to ſpeake of, and let me tell you, that this king neuer loued ſome actions of the Lord Dom Antonio (who was couſin germaine to his father the Prince D. Iohn) becauſe he was a man addicted to women, loftie, ſomewhat vnquiet, and he had demaunded of the Queene D. Catharine, and of the Cardinal D. Henriques brother to his grandfather the king D. Iohn, and to the infant D. Lewes, father to Antonio, ſomewhat that they would not giue him, as finding they were not ſo much beholding to him. Some few daies before he departed on his Affrick voyage, in verie much choler he had ſome ſharp and rough ſpeech with Dom Antonio: and thereupon the ſaid Lord was not ſhipped in the ſame Gallion with the king, but in that of Dom Alphonſo, de Portugall, Earle of Vimieuſe (father to D. Frances de Portugall, who came into France with the title of Conſtable) to whom he was a verie great friend. So much for the Lord Dom Antonio: and ſo much likewiſe for the infant, whom

               D. Sebaſtian neuer knew (for when he died in the end of the 
                  •
                1555. Sebaſtian was but two yeeres olde) he was a Prince great in vertue and wiſedome, of whom Duarte Nunes de

words he pronounced: and if any one of them that parleyed with him, intermedled any French words among the reſt (becauſe the moſt part of them had liued in Fraunce, and ſpake the French language) he would tell them of it: ſo that yet he ſeemes better to vnderſtand that tongue, then ſpeake it. One writes likewiſe, that he ſaith, the armour he ware is hid in a certaine place. That the duke de Aueyro, the Earles of Redondo, and of Sortella, D. Fernand de Meneſes, and D. Iohn de Caſtro, coſin germaine to him whom we haue ſo often named, are all yet aliue, that he very wel knowes where they are, & ſo ſoone as he ſhal haue commodious means, he will ſend to thē. Chriſtophero de Tauora was ſlaine before his eies by certain robbers, that ſet vpō thē as they iourneyed.
            
               Dom Iohn de Caſtro writ in a letter to me, that his face is now much altered from the forme it had at his parting in Affricke. As for the ſmall wrinkles in his face, thoſe he knew very perfectly, ſo likewiſe did Sebaſtian Figuera; the Father de Sampayo, Pantaleon Peſſoa, Frances Antoine and other Portuguezes, beſide ſundrie ſtraungers, that had ſeene him and knew him when he was in Portugall. And as for his gate or cariage of his bodie, it is the verie ſame without any altering. Moreouer, that he departed from Venice in the time aſſigned him, and is comming for Fraunce, himſelfe with others being on the way with him. He praies me to order my buſineſſe in ſort, that I would be preſent in the Court of his moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie, attending this aduenture ſo ſtrange and maruellous: ſo farre the letter.
            For this cauſe (worthie Lord) and in reſpect, whether he come by ſea or land, or whether he will paſſe for Holland from hence: I am determined not to be abſent, till I haue ſeene him here, or vnderſtand he hath taken ſome other courſe. If I ſhould do otherwiſe, I thinke the world would repute me a bad ſeruant to my King, and an enemie to my true and ſoueraigne Lord. But I find there are ſome, moued (by what diuels I know not) that labour ſtill to perſwade me, and would perforce make me to beleeue, although theſe newes are ſo true, publique and certaine, yet that this King of Portugall Dom Sebaſtian, is no other then a Calabrois. But as that language is engendred and borne from the wombe of a Caſtillian, ſo I anſwere ſuch kind of men, that it is behoouefull for them to knowe, I am more bound to credite

                  〈◊〉
                nor ſpeake with him: hereof I haue ſtore of good witneſſes yet to this day.
            If little more then three yeares had ſo much power, ſo ſtrangely to alter the Lord Dom Chriſtophero, how much more may aboue twentie yeares, chaunge the king Dom Sebaſtian? Let this ſuffice to anſwer the ignorant and malicious. As for his ſpeaking Portugueze: who hath examined him? not I certainely, nor any other Portugueze ſemblable to me. He ſpeakes a mixed kind of Portugueze (my good Lord) according as Dom Iohn de Caſtro writes to me in his laſt letter. As for his writing, it is the ſame, and the ſelfe ſame hand: I haue ſeene many memories and papers written by him, which being conferred with the other that he writte before his paſſage to Affricke, the one and other doe truely agree. For the reſt, when the King Dom Sebaſtian ſhall be in good eſtate, though he ſpeake not Portugueze, I will hold him excuſed; conſidering it is more then twenty years that he hath bene foorth of his country, and ſtill trauelled among ſtraungers.
            In this citie of Lyons, among the Spaniſh Comedians, there is a Portugueze aged about ſome thirtie yeares, a man well born, learned, and ſpeakes the Latin tongue very well, the place of his birth not farre from mine: from him I could neuer get one Portugueze word, yet ſpeakes he as perfect Caſtilian, as if he had bene borne and brought vp in the Court of Madrill: and it is but fiue yeares ſince he hath bene abſent from his owne countrey, where be forſooke his kindred, ſome of them being well knowne to me. We haue an hundred thouſand like examples through all

               he firſt deceiuer; but in Flaunders there was a Baldwin,
               
in Fraunce a Martin Guerre, &c. I can very well (as one that hath read ſome hiſtories) helpe ſuch kind of people to proue their intentions, remembring them of the names and deedes of ſome impoſtors: ſetting apart the Neroes and others, as Smerdis the Mago king of the Perſians, the falſe Alexander of Syria, ſonne to Protarcus a man of baſe condition: Lambert Symnell, who named himſelfe Edward the fift king of England, and ſonne to Edward the fourth, Peter Warbecke, whom the Engliſh call Periquin, or Perkin, who needs would be Richard younger brother to the ſayd Edward, and others. But the fact and proceeding of theſe, differed greatly from the examen and true ſquare of King Dom Sebaſtian: alſo the meanes and reſpects whereby they preſumed for kings titles, caried another habite then this of king Sebaſtians. Concerning Baldwin and Martin Guerre, their iuglings were diſcouered in very few daies: ſo fel it out with Smerdis, for Phaedimia the daughter of Otanes, diſproued him quickly by his ſhort eares: and ſo was he knowne to be Mago, brother to Cantizites, & not for Smerdes the ſon of Cyrus. The falſe Alexander, an Aegyptian by nation, was brought in by Ptolomie Euergetes, againſt Demetrius the younger. Lambert Symnell was prouoked on by great men of England, to terme himſelfe a king, againſt Henry the ſeuenth, of whom they could not endure the gouernement. Peter Warbecke, a natiue of Tournay, by the meanes and fauour of Margaret Ducheſſe of Burgundie, ſecond wife to Charles the warriour: named himſelfe Richard, youngeſt ſonne to King Edward the fourth, and by her bare himſelfe againſt the ſayd king Henrie.
            
            But King Sebaſtian is riſen in another kind of degree, without ayde, without fauour, not aſſiſted by any Prince, poore and miſerable, armed onely with his truth, and the conduct of God: and yet we hope he ſhall not want helpe for the recouerie of his kingdome. This is then ſufficient to anſwere thoſe queſtionarie contriuers. As for their demaund to me, where he hath had abiding for ſo many yeares, and why he ſpared to make himſelfe manifeſt: himſelfe one day (when it pleaſeth God) will therein reſolue vs. It is no new thing to heare of a man, that haue not bene heard of for many yeares.

18. of Nouēber, the 28. we arriued at Venice, where being with other Portuguezes, we were enformed of the buſineſſe, and what was expedient to be done for him. Certaine daies after, the Lord Dom Chriſtophero required audience, which was giuen him on Monday the 11. of December. Before he entred to the Senate, he was cauſed to ſit downe without, in a chamber richly hung with tapiſtrie, where he attended till he ſhould be called in. They gaue him the ſeate on the right hand of the Prince, & ſpeaking to him, termed him Illustriſsime: when theſe courteſies had bin done him, he gaue in writing what he deſired.
                  The ſame day, the Prince, with aboue two hundred of the principall Seigneurs of that State, entred to Councell, touching the matter of the king D. Sebaſtian our Lord: this aſſembly is called the Pregay, there they determine of matters graue and important. The Tueſday following, the Pregay held againe for the ſame cauſe. The wedneſday being S. Lucies day, the Pregay held not at all, becauſe they then made election of an Attourney. They ſate againe the Thurſeday, and the Friday following the caſe was concluded. At night after ten a clocke, the King our Lord was called to the Senate, where to him was intimated, the ſelfe intimation which had bene made to him by the Podeſtate of Padoa, the yeare 1598. It is ſaid, that when the king entred the Senate, and while the decree of his ſentence was reading, all the Seigneurs were vp on their feete, and noted him with very much reſpect. The king being gone from the Senate, went preſently, without admitting the companie of any one, (though many made offer of themſelues) to the lodging of his firſt hoſt, maiſter Frances, where I had diuerſe times ſeene him before his impriſonment.
                  Thither came Rodrigo Marques, and Sebaſtian Figuera, who at firſt ſight of him was much aſtoniſhed, becauſe he found him verie different from him whome he had ſeene in Portugall, and in Barbarie the verie ſame day of our ouerthrowe, flying foure leagues diſtance from the field of battaile. But when he had well conſidered the forme of his face, the dimples, the browe, the eyes, noſe, and Auſtrich lippe, (which is not now ſo plumpe, as when he was in Portugall, becauſe then he was in good plight, and now verie meagre) his

                     After he had long time held diſcourſe with vs, in common and ſeuerally of diuerſe matters, we intreated him to eate ſomething: but he anſwered, that becauſe it was Friday, hee would not ſo much as make a collation, but only would faſt with bread and water, and meant not to breake that faſt, for he was thereto obliged by a vowe. Hereupon we intreated him to take his reſt, but we could not obtaine ſo much of him: all that he would then permit vs to do about him, was to pull off his ſhooes, to warme him. I pulled off the right, and preſently paſſed my hand along the toes, where I felt the wart on the litle toe, which is ſo great, as it makes a reſemblance of a ſixt toe. Furthermore we deſired him to do vs ſo much grace, as to tell vs ſomewhat of his fortunes, whereto he anſwered; That he had liued euermore in trauell, in miſerie and pouertie; but the talke thereof we ſhould referre till another time, and tell him ſome tidings of his friends, & of ſuch things which as thē might giue him pleaſure to heare. Then he began to view vs verie earneſtly one after another, and ſeeing vs habited of diuerſe faſhions and colours, becauſe ſome were attired after the French, others like Hollanders, ſome Italian like, and Frances Antoine as a Pilgrime, with his walking ſtaffe in his hand: he began to ſay ſmiling, Tanto trage? So manie ſorts? which he ſpake with ſuch a grace, as comforted and greatly gladded vs to heare; and thoſe of vs that had perfectly knowne him before, ſaw in this verie act, that he was our true Lord and King Dom Sebaſtian.
                  
                  He then enquired of the Lord Dom Chriſtophero, concerning your Excellencie; of D. Iohn de Caſtro touching his brethren, & particularly of Frier Fernand, a Religious of Saint Dominique, beſide, concerning his vncles and kindred. Then of all in generall, for the Ladie Domne Catherine his aunt Ducheſſe of Bragancia, and the Duke her ſonne, telling vs, that when he made the Affrick voyage with him, he was verie litle, but faire (the ſaid duke hauing not then accompliſhed 
                        •
                      yeares.) Then he enquired likewiſe of his Pallace de la Ribera; of Euchobregas, of Caſtillo; and principally of thoſe de Santos le vieil (which I thinke did belong to the father of Dom Iohn, or elſe to his grandfather Dom Iohn de Caſtro) whether they were ſound, enlarged, or deſtroyed? He verie much loued the ſituation thereof, as being

                     age to Affricke) and in his pallace of Ribera at Lisbon; 
                        •
                     h as much ſimplicitie did he proceed in all, and through

all, plainely, without fraude, cauillation or heate, as it had bene an infant of ten yeeres old.
                  When he had awhile well noted the Lord Dom Chriſtophero your brother, he ſaid vnto him: You reſemble verie much Dom Antonio your father, but I pray God (in deeds) you may reſemble your grandfather the infant Dom Lewes Duke of Bega; in ſteed of ſaying Beja. He pronounceth what he ſpeakes in Portugueſe, but makes a mixture of other ſtrange words there amongſt, or by the breaking of diuers ſillables. As, when he ſpake to vs of France, he would vſually ſay Franca. And we would ſay: Sir, in Portugueſe, we ſay Franca. How? quoth he, doe not we ſay in Portugueſe, 
                        Ʋilla-franca, Paramanca, &c? In like maner as when we intermeddle ſome French word among our Portugueſe, we ſhall and do relliſh it, becauſe we haue bene in France, and know how to ſpeake French, and ſo by cuſtome fal into the ſame blame he doth.
                  We ſpent three houres and more with his Maieſtie in theſe diſcourſings, after which, the Lord Dom Chriſtophero and others withdrew themſelues, and he remained with D. Iohn and Diego Manuel: who likewiſe ſtept aſide into another chamber, leauing him alone where he had beene, to the end he might repoſe himſelfe, becauſe he had not ſlept in all the night before; but in ſteede of ſleeping, he fell to prayer. Before we left him, he offered to pull on his ſhooes; D. Iohn made offer, but could not, albeit he tooke paines enough: nor likewiſe Diego Manuel after D. Iohn, becauſe the inſteppe of his foote was ſo high, as it required much better ſtrength to pull them on. He ſeeing that they could not attaine it, ſet his foote vpon a ſtoole, and pluckt it on himſelfe verie eaſily: a verie certaine teſtimonie of his naturall ſtrength, and a verifying of that which is ſaide among the markes of his bodie.
                  The father de Sampayo and Frier Chryſoſtome ſtaid not long before they came, who with the King and D. Iohn, thought good to haue him out of that houſe (becauſe the people began now to make a murmuring and grumbling, euerie one being verie deſirous to ſee him) & to conuey him to the couent of S.

                     gence, being refreſhing himſelfe on land, that there was a of warre ariued, who made enquirie after two religious perſons,

and had ſouldiers abord ſent from the Ambaſſadour of Caſtille) and ſo that they were gone by Padoa.
                  Hereupon I ſhipt my ſelfe againe in hope to recouer them, which was impſſible for me, by reaſon of the waters extremitie, but was conſtrained to returne to Venice. Here let me tell your Excellencie, that the night whereon the king was enlarged, there aroſe in Venice a verie great wind, which endured vntil midnight after the next day: wherein enſued ſuch a mightie ouerflow of the waters in the citie, as it drowned vp great ſtore of houſes, and did harme to the amounting of aboue three millions. For all the ceſternes were loſt, alſo the wines, the ſpices, ſugers and merchandiſes, that were in their lower warehouſes. This inundation began (as I ſaid) on tueſday at night the 19. of December, the day limitted for the Kings departing from the confines of the Siegneurie, as likewiſe notwithſtanding he did. A thing which bred a verie ſtraunge amazement among the men in thoſe parts, who held diuers opinions of this accident, and almoſt all aſſured themſelues, that the preſence of this holy King, was a wonderfull preſeruation to the citie.
                  All matters concerning this Prince, are accommpanied with extraordinarie ſignes from heauen. One told me on the way, that the 28. of the moneth paſt, fell two ſuch thunder claps at Florence, as haue ſhiuerd la Copa of the great Church, and almoſt an vnrecouerable loſle. For it is ſaid, the work can neuer be brought to the perfection wherein it was, in the iudgement of the beſt, if they would diſpend theron foure hundred thouſand crownes: the firſt amounted to ſixe hundred thouſand; they that imagine the leaſt, ſpeake of two hundred thouſand.
                  So ſoone as I was at Venice, came the letters of Frier Chryſoſtome, written from Padoa; wherein he ſignified, that the King would go thence by Ferrara, and from Ferrara to Florence, whereon, they all put themſelues in readineſſe to follow. And becauſe manie report that the king trauelled continually like a Jacobine: I aſſure your Excellencie they deceiue themſelues, for he left it off at his parting from Padoa, betaking himſelfe to his Cape and r

At the beginning, he anſwered them ſtill to verie good purpoſe, but in the end, ſeeing they would do him no ſuch fauours as he deſired, but only proceed with him in nothing but demands: being ſomewhat by nature impatient and cholericke, he much diſdained to anſwere their interrogatories. Notwithſtanding, being returned to the priſon, and diſcourſing to the priſoners what demaunds they had made to him, he ſaid: I anſwered here and there to ſuch a demand, but I muſt anſwere ſuch and ſuch things.
