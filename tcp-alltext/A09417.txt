            TO THE RIGHT
worshipfull, my very worthy
and Christian friend, Sir
Williā Gee, knight, one of his
Maiesties honorable Counsel
in the North. Recorder of the
Townes of Beuerley and Hull,
and one of his Maiesties Iustices
of Peace in the East-riding
of the Countie of Yorke,
a true friend of learning, and
pietie: & to the vertuous, and
religious Lady his wife,
Grace and peace from
God, &c.
            AMongst the many
reasons (Worshipfull
Sir) which haue
perswaded me that Poperie
cannot be the true Religion,
this is not the least:

the insufficiencie of their
doctrine of faith and repē
               tance:
which two things,
though they be the chiefe
and principall points in religion,
and so necessarie,
that he, who doth not but
know, and practise them
aright, can neuer bee saued:
yet I dare auouch,Canitius in Cate
                  
                     •
                  hismo. Costerus in Enchiridio.
that the faith and Repentance
of the Romish
church, as they are taught
by many of the best approoued
Papists, are no
better thē such a faith, and
such a repētance as an hypocrite,
and a very reprobate
may attaine vnto. Indeede,
to insist vpon repentance

only (they make
many faire florishes, they
call it penance, they make
it a Sacrament,Corradus, Nauarrus, Loper Sairus, Grasffius, Hallus, and many other. and say it
is a boord that saues a
man after shipwracke, and
write great volumes of it,
and of confession, and of
Cases of Conscience, (as you
good Syr in your owne
reading knowe better then
I) and yet alas, when all is
done, it is but a shadowe
of repentance; and indeede
how can they teach
aright the doctrine of repentance:
which erre so
fowly in setting downe
the iustice of God, and
the vilenesse of sinne:

Which two points a man
must know, else hee will
neuer repent: but Poperie
misconceiuing the iustice
of God, teaching it
not to bee infinite, in as
much as it needes not an
infinite satisfaction, and
misconceiuing the nature
of sinne, teaching euery
sinne not to be damnable,
nor to offend Gods infinite
iustice, erring (I say)
in these two, how is it possible
they should conceiue
aright the nature of repentance?
by which a
man seeing his sinnes, their
foulenesse, their punishment,
and his owne miserie

by them, confesseth
them, bewailes them, fearing
Gods iustice, flieth
from it, and craues forgiuenesse
of his mercy:
and lastly purposeth, and
indeuoureth to leaue thē
all, and to leade a new life.
The serious consideration
heereof, hath often
made mee wonder, why
many popish treatises, being
in some sort exhortations
to repētance, should
be so accounted of as they
are by some: for though I
confesse, there are in
some of them, good and
wholesome meditations,
and manye motiues

to mortification, & good
life, yet woulde I gladly
learne of any man but this
one thing, howe those exhortations
can bee pithie,
or powerfull, sound, or any
way sufficient to moue
a man to repentance, whē
as, not those bookes, not
all Poperie is able to
teach a man sufficiently
what true repentance
is.
            If any man reply: I will
therefore learne the doctrine
out of the Protestants
bookes: and vse
the Papists for exhortation
onely: I then answere;
Is it not a more compendious,

and conuenient,
and a lesse scandalous
course, to seeke exhortations
out of such writers, as
do teach the doctrine aright?
nay I doubt howe it
is possible to finde a powerfull
exhortation to repentance
in any Papist,
who erres in the Doctrine:
the reason is manifest, because
Doctrine is the
ground of exhortation:
and if the doctrine bee vnsound,
how can the exhortation
bee any better? Let
vs therefore leaue these
muddie puddles, and
fette our water at the
Fountaine: the water

of life, at the fountaine of
life: I meane the doctrine
of faith, and repentance,
at the written worde of
God, and at such mens
writings as are grounded
thereupon, and agreeable
thereunto.
            Nowe,Deering, Greenha, Bradford, and many. amongst those
many instrumentes of
God, who haue laboured
with profite in this great
point of Religion: namely
repentance, drawing
their doctrine out of the
breasts, of the two Testamens
of Gods booke, I
may well say, (to say no
more) that this man of
GOD, Maister Perkings,
               
deserues to haue his
place: whose labours,
whilest he liued, and his
yet liuing labours, what
they deserue, I had rather
others should proclaime,
then I once name: who
professe my selfe to be one
of those many, who many
truly say, that by the grace
of God, and his good
meanes principally, I am
that I am: But leauing
him in that glorious mansion,
which Christ the
Lord of the Haruest hath
prepared for him: and
now giuen him: I returne
to my selfe, and doe humbly
praise the Lord of heauen,

who gaue mee my
time in the Vniuersitie, in
those happie daies, wherein)
beside many worthy
men of God, whereof
some are falne a sleepe, and
some remaine aliue vnto
this day) this holy man did
spend himselfe like a candle,
to giue light vnto others.
            The scope of all his godly
endeuours was to teach
Christ Iesus, and him crucified,
and much laboured
to moue all men to repentance,
that as our knowledge
hath made Poperie
ashamed of their ignorance:
so our holy liues

might honour our holy
profession. And as repentance
was one of the principall
endes, both of his
continuall preaching and
writing: so especially and
purposely hath hee twise
dealte in that Argument.
            First, in his Treatise of
Repentance: published,
1592. wherein briefly
(as his manner was▪) but
soundly, pithily, and feelingly,
he laieth down the
Doctrine, and the very
nature of Repentance:
and after the positiue
Doctrine, hee toucheth
some of the principall

controuersies and difficulties
in that doctrine, but
afterwards thinking with
himselfe, that hee had not
seriously and forcibly enough,
vrged so great and
necessarie a lesson as Repentance
is, therefore
shortly after, being desired
and called to the dutie
of Preaching, in that
great, and generall assembly
at Stirbridge Faire, hee
thought it a fit time, for
this necessarie and generall
exhortation to Repentance:
to the intent,
that as wee were taught
the Doctrine of Repentance,
in the former treatise:

so in these Sermons
wee might be stirred vp to
the practise of it. And certainly,
(good Sir:) I iudge
there coulde haue beene
no matter, more fitte for
that assembly, then an exhortation
to repentance:
for as the audience was
great and generall, of all
sorts, sexes, ages and callings
of men, and assembled
out of many corners
of this kingdome, so is
this doctrine generall for
all: some doctrines are for
parents, some for children,
some for schollers, some
for trades-men, some for
men, some for women,

but repentance is for all:
without which, it may bee
saide of all, and euery one
of age, not one excepted:
No Repentance, no saluation.
            These Sermons being
in my hands, and not deliuered
to mee from hand
to hand, but takē with this
hand of mine, from his
own mouth, were thought
worthy for the excellēcie,
and fit for the generalitie
of the matter, to bee offered
to the publique view:
I haue also other works of
his in my hands: of which
(being many,) I confesse
my selfe to be but the keeper

for the time, taking
my selfe bound to keepe
thē safely, to the benefite
of Gods church, of whose
treasure vpon earth I make
no question, but they are
a part: and I hartily desire
you (my good friendes)
and all other faithful Christians,
to solicite the Lord
in praier for me, that I may
faithfully discharge my
selfe of that great charge
which in this respect lieth
vpō me: & that his grace &
blessing may be on me and
all others, who are to bee
imployed in this seruice,
wherein (had the Lord
so pleased) wee coulde

heartily haue wished neuer
to haue bene imployed:
but that his life might
haue eased vs of the labour:
and that as I begin
with this, so I, or some other
better able (which I
rather desire) may goe forward,
vndertaking the
weight of this great burthen,
and not faint, till he
haue made a faithfull account
to the Church of
God, of all the Iewels deliuered
to our trust.
            And nowe these first
fruites of my labours, in
another mans vine yard,
as also all that hereafter
do or may follow, I humbly

consecrate to the blessed
spouse of Christ Iesus,
the holy Church of God
on earth, and namely to
the Church of England,
our beloued mother, who
may reioyce, that shee was
the mother of such a son,Maister Perkings, but fortie yeares olde at his death.
who in fewe yeares did so
much good to the publique
cause of religion, as
the wickednesse of many
yeares shall not bee able to
weare out. But first of all,
and especially, I present
the same vnto you (my very
worshipfull and Christian
friendes) who (I must
needes say) are very worthy
of it in many respects.
            
               
1. For the matter it selfe,
which is repentance, my
selfe being able to testifie,
that you are not hearers,
but dooers, rise in knowledge,
and rise in the practice
of Repentance: insomuch
as I dare from the
testimonie of my conscience,
and in the word of a
Minister, pronoūce of you
that as you haue heard and
knowne this doctrine of
repentance, so blessed are
you, for you doe it.
            And 2. for him who was
the author hereof (whose
mouth spake it from the
feeling of his soule, and
whose soule is now bound

vp in the bundle of life:
I know, & cannot in good
conscience conceale the
great delight you haue alwaies
had in the reading
of his books, the reuerend
opinion, you had of him
liuing, & how heauily and
passionately, you took his
death & departure: therefore
to cheare you vp in
want of him, I send you
here this little booke, his
own child, begotten in his
life time, but borne after
his death: obserue it
well, and you shall finde
it, not vnlike the father,
yea, you shall discerne in
it the fathers spirit, and it

doubts not, but to finde
entertainment with them,
of whom the father was so
well respected.
            And for my selfe, I spare
to rehearse what interest
you haue in me, and all my
labours, it is no more then
you worthily deserue, and
shall haue in me for euer:
you are the fairest flowers
in this garden, which
in this place, I after others
haue planted for the Lord
(or rather God by vs):
And two principall pearls
in that Crowne, which I
hope for, at the last day
from the Lord my God,
whose word at my mouth

you haue receiued with
much reuerence, and with
such profit, as if I had the
like successe of my labours
in others, I should then
neuer haue cause to say
with the Prophet, I haue
laboured in vaine, & spent
my strength in vaine, but
my iudgement is with the
Lord, and my worke with
my God.
            And if I knew you not,
to bee such as take more
delight in doing well, then
in hearing of it, I would
prooue at large, what I
haue spoken of you: yet
giue me leaue to say that,
which without open

wrong, I may not conceale,
that beside your
care, knowledge, and godly
zeale to religion, and other
duties of the first table
to God himselfe, your
charitie and pietie to the
needie distressed Christians,
at home and abroad:
your mercifull dealing
with them, who are in
your power; your beneuolence
to learning, and
namely to some in the Vniuersitie,
do all proclaime
to the worlde those your
due prayses: which I (well
knowing your modesties)
doe spare once to name:
neither would I haue saide

thus much, were it not for
this cold and barren age,
wherein we liue, that so,
when our preaching cannot
moue, yet your godly
examples might stirre vp.
Pardon me therfore I pray
you, & thinke it no wrong
to you,Ps. 11. 16. which is a benefit
to Gods Church:Apoc. 2. 10. But goe
forward in the strength
of the Lord your God,1. Thes. 5. 24. &
hold on in that happie
course you haue begun,
be faithfull vnto the ende,
the Lord will giue you
the Crowne of life:
faithfull is hee, which
hath promised, who will
also doe it: proceede

(good Sir) to honour
learning in your selfe and
others, and religion especially,
which is the principallearning,
and proceede
both of you, to practise
religion in your owne persons;
and in your family,
hold on to shine before
your familie, and amongst
the people, where you
dwel, in zeale and holines:
holde on hereby, still to
shame poperie, to stoppe
your enemies mouthes,
and to honour that holy
religion, which you professe,
to gaine comfort of
good conscience to your
selues, & assurance of eternall

reward: and lastly, to
encourage mee in those
painefull duties which lye
vpon mee: for I openly
professe that your religious
zeale and loue of the
truth, with many other
good helpes, are principall
encouragementes in
my ministerie, and especiall
motiues vnto mee, to
vndertake the charge of
publication, of so many
of the workes of this holy
man deceased, as may not
in better manner be done
by others. But I keepe you
too long from this holy exhortation
following; I
therefore send you it, and

it to you, and from
you, to the Churche of
God: for I dare not make it
priuately yours and mine,
wherein the whole church
hath interest, as well as we:
It was Preached in the
field, but it is worthy to be
admitted into our hearts:
I found it in the opē field,
but vpon diligent viewe,
finding it to bee Gods
corne, and a parcell of his
holy and immortall seede,
therefore I brought it
home, as good corne deserues:
And as it is Gods
corne, so in you, I desire all
holy Christians to lay it vp
in Gods garners, that is, in

their hearts and soules.
            And thus committing
this little volume to your
reading, the matter to
your practise: you and
yours, to the blessed fauour
of that God, whome you
serue: and my selfe and my
endeuours, to your hartie
loue, and holy prayers, I
take leaue: From my studie;
August. 7. 1607.
            
               Yours in Christ Iesus,
euer assured,
William Crashawe.
               
            
         
         
            
            
            TO
THE CHRIStian
Reader, and especially
to all such as haue
any copies of the works
of Maister Perkins, or
intend any of them
to the Presse.
            FOr asmuch as there hath
beene lately signification
made, of diuers of Maister
Perkins his workes hereafter
to be Printed, in an Epistle
to the Reader premised
before the Treatise of Callings,
and the signification

being but generall, might peraduenture
giue occasion to
some, to set out some particulars
(without the consent of
Maister Perkins his Assignes)
as imperfectly as are
these two Bookes, intituled,
The Reformation of Couetousnesse,
and The Practise
of Faith, iustly and
truely (for ought that I see)
censured in the aforesaide Epistle.
It is therefore nowe
thought good to mention the
particular Treatises, and
workes of his, which shall
hereafter (if God will) bee
published, for the benefite of
Gods Church: I doe therefore
heereby make knowne to

all, whome it any way may
concerne, that there were
found in the Studie of the deceased,
and are in the hands
of his Executours, or Assignes,
and preparing for the
Presse.
            1. His Expositions on the Epistle
to the Galathians.
            2. On the Epistle of Iude.
            
            2. His Booke of the Cases of
Gonscience.
            3. His Treatises, 1. Of Witchcraft.
2. Of Callings.
            All these hee had perused
himselfe, and made them
ready for the Presse, according
to which Coppies
by himselfe so corrected,
some of them alreadie are,

and the rest will bee published
in due time. And here vpon
wee desire all men who haue
Coppies of them, not to offer
that wrong to that worthy
man of God, as to publish any
of their owne, seeing the coppies
heereof which are to bee
Printed, are of his owne correcting:
but rather if they
can helpe to make any of them
more perfect by their Coppies,
they may therein dooe a good
worke to the benefit of manie,
and much comfort to themselues.
            And further, I doe heereby
make knowne, that I haue
in my handes at this present
of his workes, taken from his

mouth, with my owne hand,
heereafter (if God will) to bee
published, with the allowance
of our Church, and for the benefite
of his Children, these
particulars.
            1. His Expositions or Readings
on the 101. psalme.
            2. On the 32. Psalme.
            3. On the 11. chapt. to the
Hebrewes.
            4. On the 1 2 and 3. Chap.
of the Reuelation.
            5. On the 5. 6. & 7. chapt.
of Saint Matthewe.
            2. His confutation of Canisius,
his little Popish Catechisme.
            3. His Treatises, 1. Of Imaginations,
out of Gen. 8. 2.
            
               
2. Of temptations, out of
Mathew. 4.
            3. Of Christian equitie,
out of Phillippians,
4. 3.
            4. Of the Callings of the
Ministery, out of two places
of Scripture.
            5. Of Repentance, out of
Zephaniah. 2. 1.
            Besides many other particular
Sermons, and short discourses
made vpon seuerall,
and speciall occasions: of all
which, some are alreadie published
by others, and some by
my selfe: and all the rest that
remaine, as they be the Iewels
of Gods Church, so did I
willingly dedicate them to

the publique and generall
good, Iudging it were a foule
sinne in mee, or any other, to
impropriate to our sinnes, or
our owne priuate vse, the labours
of This, or any other
learned man, which are in
my opinion; partes of the
Treasurie of the militant
Church: And as it were
wrong to the Church, if
I should conceale them, so
doubtlesse were it to him and
his children, if I should publish
them for mine owne alone,
and not for their benefite.
If I doe, I thinke it may bee
iustly saide vnto mee, or
whosoeuer doeth so, Thy
money perish with thee.
               
And what herein I haue saide
for my selfe: I knowe I may
boldely and safely say, for his
Executours or Assignes,
which haue or had in their
handes, anie of those which
were found in his Studie: In
the publishing of all which, as
wee doe intend to deale truely
with the Christian Reader,
and not to commit anie thing
to the Presse, which hath not
eyther beene written or corrected,
by the Author himselfe,
or faithfullie penned
according to the truest Coppies,
taken from his owne
mouth, and since by others of
sufficiency and integritie, diligently
perused: some purpose

to referre them to the benefit
of the Authours wife and
children, as much as may be,
wishing that vpon this Caueat,
men would not bee so
hastie (as some haue beene) to
commend to the world, their
vnperfect notes, vpon a
base desire of a little gaine,
both to hinder the common
good of the Church, and to defraud
the said parties of their
priuate benefite, to whom in
all equitie and conscience, it
doth principally appertaine:
And desiring all who haue any
perfect Copies of such as
are in my owne hands, that
they would either helpe mee
with theirs, or rather take

               mine to helpe them. That by
our ioynt power, and our forces
laide together: the walles
of this worthy building, may
goe vp the fayrer, and the faster.
And so I commend them
all to Gods blessing, who endeuour
to commend themselues,
and their labours,
to God, and to his
Church.

            AN EXHORtation
to Repentance.
            
               Zephoniah. Chap. 2. ver. 1. 2.
               Searche your selues, euen searche
you ô Nation, not worthy to be
beloued: before the Decree
come forth, and you bee as
Chaffe, that passeth on a day.
            
            THe Prophet in the first
Chapter of this Prophesie,
rebuketh the Iewes of
three notable crimes, Idolatrie,
fraude, and crueltie. In
this second he exhorts them
to Repentance, and withall

reprooueth some of their speciall
sinnes. In the three first
verses hee propoundeth the
doctrine of Repentance, and
addeth some speciall reasons
to mooue and stirre them vp
to the practise of it. In propounding
the doctrine of repentance,
he directs it to two
sorts of men. First, to the obstinate
and impenitent Iewes,
in the first and second verses.
Secondly, to the better sorte
of them, in the third. So that
the summe and substance of
these twoo first verses, is a
briefe and summarie propounding
of the doctrine of
Repentance to the obstinate
Iewes. The wordes containe
in them fiue seuerall
points, touching the doctrine
of Repentance.
            
               
1. The dutie to bee performed,
Search.
            
            2. Who must be searched?
your selues.
            
            3. Who must doe it? The
Iewes: who are further described
to be a nation, not worthy
to be beloued of God. These
are in the first verse.
            4. In the second verse, the
time limitting them when to
repent, before the decree come
forth: that is, before God put
in execution the iudgements
which are alreadie decreed &
appointed for them.
            5 A forcible reason vrging
them to do it, which lieth hid,
and is necessarilie implyed in
the 4. pointe; namely, that
there is a decree against them,
which wants nothing but execution,
which also shall come,

vnlesse they repent, wherby
they shal be fanned: & if they
shal be found to be chaff, they
shal flie away with the winde
of Gods iustice. Of all these
points in order.
            
               For the first, the holy
Ghost saith; Search your
selues. The wordes are commonly
read thus. Gather your
selues; which though it bee
good, for that in Repentance
a man gathereth himselfe, &
all his wits together, which
afore were dispersed, & wandred
vp and downe in vanitie:
yet I rather allowe their
translation who reade thus.
Search or fanne your selues: but
either of them may stand, because
the word in the originall
doth comprehend both
significations; yet it seemeth
that to search, or sift, fits this

place better, considering the
same manner of speech is afterwardes
continued in the
word Chaffe: so that the meaning
of the holy Ghost seemeth
to be this: Search, try,
and fanne your selues, least
you bee found light chaffe,
and so flie away and be consumed
before the Iustice of
God.
               Concerning this dutie of
searching, let vs obserue first,
that the holy Ghost vrging
the Iewes to repent, vseth
not the word Repentance,
but bids them search themselues:
yet meaning, he wold
haue them to repent: giuing
vs to vnderstand, that no
man can haue true & sound
repentance, but he who hath
first of all searched and examined

him selfe: and this
stands with good reason, for
no man can repent, who first
of all doeth not knowe himselfe,
and his owne wretchednes.
But no man can see into
himselfe, nor know himselfe,
but hee that doeth diligentlie
search himselfe: so that the
beginning of all grace, is for a
man to search, & trie, and fan
himselfe, that therby he may
knowe what is in himselfe:
that so vpon the searche, seeing
his fearefull and damnable
estate, hee may forsake
himselfe and his owne wayes,
and turne to the Lord. Thus
speaketh the holie Ghost in
the heartes of holie men;Lam 3.
                  Let vs searche and trye our
wayes: and marke what followeth;
and turne againe to the

Lord: as though there were
no turning againe vnto the
Lord, but after a searching of
our selues. With this testimony
of the holy Ghost, agreeth
the testimonie of all
holy mens consciences, who
all know, that the first beginning
of their turning vnto
the Lorde, was a searching of
themselues. Let any repentant
sinner aske his conscience,
& call to minde his first
calling and conuersion, and
hee will remember that the
first thing in his Repentance
was this; that he searched into
himselfe, and looked narrowly
into his wayes, and finding
his wayes dangerous, &
his case fearful, did thervpō resoule
to take a new course, &
turn to the Lord for pardō &

mercy, and for grace to enter
into more holie, and more
comfortable courses.
               The man that passeth vpon
ridges of mountaines, and
sides of hills, or that goeth ouer
a narrow bridge, or some
dangerous and steepe rocks,
at midnight, feareth not because
he seeth no danger: but
bring the same man, in the
morning, and let him see the
narrowe bridge, hee went ouer
in the night, vnder which
runnes a violent streame, and
a bottomlesse gulfe, and the
daungerous Mountaines and
Rockes hee passed ouer, and
hee will woonder at his owne
boldenesse, and shrincke
for feare to thinke of it, and
will by no meanes venture
the same way againe: for

now he seeth the height of
the Mountaines; the steepenesse
of the hils, the cragginesse
of the Rocks, the fearefull
downfall, and the furious
violence of the streame vnderneath,
and thereby seeth
the extreame danger, which
afore he saw not: therefore he
wondreth, and reioyceth,
that hee hath escaped so
great a daunger; and will
by no meanes bee drawne to
goe that waye in the day,
which he went most carelesly
in the darknesse of the
night, but seeketh another
way (though it should bee far
about:) So a sinner in his first
estate, which is naturall and
corrupt (as wee are bred and
borne) hath a vaile before his
face; so that he seeth nothing:

the wrath of God, and the
curse due for sin, hell, & damnation,
seeking to deuoure
him, hee seeth them not, although
(liuing alwaies in sin)
he walketh in the very iawes
of hell it selfe, and because he
seeth not this fearefull daunger,
therefore he refuseth no
sin at all, but rusheth securely
into all manner of sinne: the
night of impenitencie, and
the myst of ignoraunce, so
blinding his eyes, that hee seeth
not the narrow bridge of
this life, from which if hee
slyde, hee falles immediately
into the bottomlesse pitte
of hell.
               But when as Gods Spirit
hath by the Light of Gods
word opened his eyes, and
touched his heart to consider

his estate, then hee seeth the
fraile bridge of this narrowe
life, and howe little a steppe
there is betweene him and
damnation; then hee seeth
hell open due for his sinnes,
and himselfe in the high-way
to it: sinne beeing the craggy
rocke, and hell the gaping
gulfe vnder it; this life beeing
the narrowe bridge, and
damnation the streame that
runneth vnder it.
               Then he wondereth at his
miserable estate, admireth
the mercie of GOD in keeping
him from falling into
the bottome of hell, wondereth
at the presumptuous
boldnesse of his corruption,
which so securely plodded on
towards destruction, and being
ashamed of himselfe,

and these his wayes, he turnes
his heart to the God that saued
him from these dangers;
and sets himselfe into more
holie wayes, and more comfortable
courses, and confesseth
that ignorāce made him
bold, and blindnes made him
so presumptuous; but nowe
he seeth the danger, & will by
no meanes goe the same way
againe: & thus the searching
and seeing into the foulenes
of sinne, and the danger therof,
is the first beginning of
repentance, and the first step
into grace.
               This doctrine teacheth vs
what faith and repentance is
generally in the world. All
men say, they belieue, and
haue repented long ago; but
trie it well, and wee shall finde

in the bodie of our Nation,
but a lippe Faith, and a lippe
Repentance: for euen when
they say so, they are blind and
ignorant of their own estate,
and knowe not themselues,
that because they are baptized
and liue in the Church,
therefore they are in Gods fauour,
& in verie good estate,
when as they neuer yet were
reconciled to God: and are so
farre from it, that they neuer
yet sawe anie sinnes in themselues,
whereof they should
repent: as a man trauelling in
the night, seeth no daunger,
but plods on without feare:
So the most part of our common
people, in the night of
their ignorance, thinke and
presume they loue and feare

God, and loue their Neighbour;
and that they haue euer
done so: Nay, it is the
common opinion that a man
may doe so by nature, and
that he is not worthy to liue,
who doth not loue God with
all his heart: and beleeue in
Iesus Christ. But alas poore
simple soules, they neuer
knewe what sinne was, neuer
searched nor sawe into their
owne hearts, with the light
of Gods law, for if they had,
they should haue seene such
a Sea of corruption, that
then they woulde confesse it
to be the hardest thing in the
world, to loue God, & to beleeue
in Christ, and forsake
sinne: it is therefore manifest,
that they haue not yet
begunne to Beleeue or Repent,

nor haue entered into
the first step of grace, which
leadeth to Repentance, for
that they haue not learned
this Lesson, which the Prophet
teacheth: that is, to
search themselues.
               
               Furthermore, let vs in the
second place, obserue better
the signification of the word:
it signifieth to searche narrowely,
as a man would doe
for a peece of Gold, or a precious
Iewell, which is lost in
a great house: Or as a man
may searche for Golde in a
Mine of the earth, where is
much earth, and but very little
golde Oare.
               Heere wee may learne,
that in true Repentance, and
conuersion, wee must not
search so onely, as to find the

grosse and palpable sinnes of
our liues: but so as wee may
finde those sinnes which the
world accounts lesser sinnes,
and espie our secret saults &
priuie corruptions. Some
corruptiōs seeme more neere
a kin of our nature, & therein
men hope to bee excused,
when they forsake many other
greater sinnes. But a true
penitent sinner must search
for such, so as a good Magistrate
searcheth for a lurking
traitor which is conueied into
some close and secret corner,
and he must ransacke his
heart for such corruptions,
as wherin his heart takes speciall
delight, and must thinke
that no sinne can be so small,
but it is too great to bee spared,
and that euery sin great

or litle, must be searched for,
as beeing all traitors to Gods
Maiestie.
               But alas, the practise of the
world is far otherwise, great
sinnes are little sinnes, little
sinnes are no sinnes: Nay, after
a little custome, great sins
are so little or nothing, and so
at last men make no bones of
grosse and grieuous sinnes:
and for the most parte men
search so superficiallie, that
they scarce finde any thing to
be sinnes: such excuses are
made, such distinctions are
deuised, such mittigations,
such qualifications, such colours
are cast vpon all sins; as
now vp & downe the world,
grosse sinnes are called into
question, whether they bee
sins or no: & the great trangressions

of the Law are coū
                  ted
small matters, necessarie
euils, or inconueniences, tollerated
to auoyd other euils:
and what is hee counted, but
a curious and precise foole,
which stands vpon them: Ignorance
after fiue and thirtie
yeares preaching, is counted
no sinne, blinde deuotion in
Gods seruice, no sinne, lippe
labour in praying, vaine and
customable swearing, mocking
of religion, and the professours
thereof, no sinne:
prophaning of the Sabbaoth,
contemning of preachers, abusing
of parentes no sinne:
pride in apparell, superfluitie
in meates, beastly & ordinarie
drunkennes, fornication,
no sinnes. Nay, deceits, cosonages,
oppressing, vsurie, notorious

briberie, and couetousnesse,
that mother sinne;
these are counted no sinnes:
these beames are made but
moates by prophane men, &
they are so minced and carued,
or there is some such necessitie
of them, or some such
other flourish or varnish must
bee cast vpon them, as that
they are little or none at all.
Alas, alas, is not that a simple
and a silly searche where such
blockes as these are, lye vnespyed?
what are moul-hilles,
when such mountains are not
seene? Moates wil be little regarded,
where such beames
are not discerned: but it is
cleere, that therefore there is
no true tryall, nor diligent
search made: for a true cōuert
wil search his hart for all, and

will spare none: He deales in
searching his own heart, as a
good Iustice of peace in searching
for Traitors or Seminarie
Priests. Hee seekes not
superficially, but most exactly,
& leaueth neuer a corner
vnsought, and he thinkes
great sinnes to be infinit, and
little sinnes great, and iudgeth
no sin so small, but that
it deserueth the anger of
God, and therefore he wonders
at the mercy of God,
which throwes vs not all
downe to hell in a moment:
and hee crieth out with holy
Ieremie: It is the Lords mercie
that wee are not consumed. Away
then with this superficiall
and hypocriticall search,
where so many sins are spared
and not found out. It is

Pharisaicall, for euen so the
Pharisie, when he came into
the Temple to recken with
God, and to tell what Traytors
hee hadde found, that is,
what sins vpon good search
he had espied, he returnes his
precept, all is well, hee hath
found neuer a one, but begins
to thank God that he was so
good, & so good, and not so
ill, and so ill, nor yet like the
Publicane. The world is full
of Pharisies, not onely the
Popish Churche, but euen
our Church swarmes with
these superficiall searches,
who cannot (because they wil
not,) finde any sinne to present
vnto God. Men thinke
in the countrey, a Church
Officer hazards his Oath,
if he present all well, and findeth

no faulte in his parish,
to present as punishable to
the Ordinary: for men think
it vnpossible, that there
should bee none in a whole
parish: then how doth that
man hazard his owne soule,
who being made ouerseer &
searcher of his heart, findes
nothing in it to present to the
Lord. For it is no more easie
to espye outward and actuall
transgressions in a
whole parish, then it is to find
a heape of corruptions in a
mans heart, if a man will
search into the bottome of it
with the light of Gods lawe.
Therefore when the Lord
comes and keepes his visitation,
what shall become of
such a man, but to vndergoe
the strict & seuere search of

the Almightie, because hee
would not search himselfe?
               Our bodies & liues are free
frō Spanish Inquisition (which
is one of the last proppes,
which Sathan hath lent the
Pope, wherewith to vpholde
his declining kingdome) and
the Lord grant we may be euer
free from it. But in the
meane time, that might put
vs in mind how to deale with
our corrupt heartes, and vnmortified
affections, euen to
erect an Inquisition ouer them,
to lay in wayte for them, to
search them narrowly, and to
vse them roughly: yea, to set
our hearts vpon the racke of
Gods Lawe, that so it may
confesse the secrete wickednesse
of it: for the Papistes
dooe not thincke vs

Protestants, greater enemies
to their superstition, then the
inwarde corruptions of our
hearts, are to our saluation:
therefore it may bee a godly
pollicie for euery man, euen
to erect an Inquisitiō
                   ouer his
owne heart and conscience,
and not to spare his most secret
& dearest sins, and such
as are neerest allyed to his
owne nature: for that is the
true search heere commaunded
by the Prophet, & practised
by all godlie and holie
men: when a man purposeth
to finde all that are, & to espie
euen all his sinnes: for a
godly man is neuer satisfied
in his searche, but still, the
more he findes, hee suspects
the more are still behinde:
and therefore he continueth

ing his owne heart all his life
long: Therefore let euerie
professor looke to it betwixt
God and his conscience, that
he dallie not with himselfe in
this case: for it hee doe, then
when God comes with his
priuie searche, his hypocrisie
shall bee discouered, and his
nakednes shalbe laid open in
the view of men, and Angels:
to his eternall confusion.
               Thirdly, Search, saith the
Prophet, but not so content:
hee forceth it againe, Euen
search you. In thus repeating
and vrging this exhortation,
the holie Ghost giues them
and vs to vnderstand, that the
true searching of a mans
heart, and life, is a dutie of a
great moment, and speciall
necessity: therefore he leaues

                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
it not after once naming it,
but inforceth it the seconde
time, as beeing no matter of
indifferencie, but of great
necessitie: thereby shewing,
that it is a principall dutie in
Repentance, euen the beginning
and foundation of all
true grace.
               And further, it is a meanes
also to preuent Gods iudgements:
for when men search
not themselues, then God
sendes the fire of afflictions,
and crosses to trie and search
them: but when they search
themselues, then God spareth
to searche them by his
iust iudgements.
               Nowe in that this dutie of
searching, is both the beginning
of all true grace, and
the meanes to staye Gods

iudgements, and therefore is
so pithelie, and forceablie,
vrged by the holie Ghost, it
must teach vs all a necessarie
lesson: namely, to make great
conscience of searching our
selues. First, because God
hath so commanded, and we
are to make conscience of obedience
to euerie commandement.
Secondly, because
thereby we shall reape two so
great commodities, as first,
therby we shal lay a sure foundation
for the good worke of
grace in vs, and secondly, shal
stay the hand of God, and his
iudgements, from beeing executed
vpon vs. Let vs therfore
hearken to this counsaile
of the holie Ghost, let
vs take the fanne of the Law,
and there with searche and

winnow our hearts and liues.
Our hearts for secret and hidden
corruptions. Our liues,
for committing of euill, and
omitting of good. Doe with
your hearts as men doe with
their wheate: they will not
suffer their corne to lye long
in the chaffe, least the chaffe
hurt it, but commits it to the
fanne, that the winde may
separate them: So the graces
of God in our hearts are but
corne, our sinnes and corruptions
are chaffe: looke
well, and thou shalt finde in
thy selfe much chaffe, and
but little corne: let not then
the chaffe lye too long mingled
with the corne, lest it corrupt
the corne. Let not thy
sinnes lye mingled with the
grace of God in thee, if thou

doe, they will choke it in the
ende, and so depriue thee of
all grace; therefore rippe vp
thy heart, and looke into thy
life, and when thou hast sinned,
enter into thy selfe, aske
thy conscience what thou
hast done, and bee not quiet
till thou hast founde out thy
sinne, and the foulenesse of it:
and neuer thinke that thou
knowest anie thing in Religion,
till thou knowest what is
in thine owne heart. And
what are in thy speciall and
priuiest corruptions, and
looke into thine owne faults,
not with a partiall eye,
but with a censorious, and
a straite iudgement, spare
sinne in no man, but especiallie
condemne it in thy
selfe.
               
                  
But alas, these times of ours,
crie out of an other state, for
euen Ieremies case is ours: We
may complaine as hee did,
No man repents him of his wickednes,
saying, what haue I done?
the same is the force of our
people, and the sickenesse of
all Nations: that euerie man
runnes on in his sinnes, from
sin to sinne carelesly: euen as
the barde horse into the battaile.
But how rare a thing is
it, to finde a man, that daylie
searcheth himselfe, and examines
how he liues, and how
the case standeth betwixte
God and himselfe: and that
when hee hath done amisse,
entereth into the closet of
his heart, and strikes himselfe
vpon the breast, and disputes
the case with himselfe,

saying; What haue I done? O
what is this, that I gaue done
against GOD, against his
Church, and against my own
soule?
               The want of this, is that
which the Prophete complaines
of in that place: not
as though it was sufficient
thus to doe, in a mans owne
conscience: but because it is
a good beginning, and a step
to further grace. For if a
man did seriously thus deale
with his conscience after
his sinne, his conscience
woulde shape him such an
aunswere, and woulde tell
him so roundlie, what hee
had done, that hee woulde
take heede, howe he did the
same againe, and looke more
narrowely, and warilie to

himselfe all the dayes of his
life. Seeing therefore it is so
necessarie a dutie, let euery
one of vs enduour the practise
of it, namely, to rippe and
ransacke our heartes, and to
searche our wayes vnto the
bottome.
               Now for our better instruction,
and furtherance in the
performance heereof: you
must knowe that this Search
is to bee made by the Law of
God, for nothing else but
Gods lawe can helpe vs, and
let vs see that which we must
search for: for if we search by
anie meanes, wee may seeke
and search long enough, ere
wee finde anie thing that will
bee matter of Repentance.
Aske the Diuell, hee will tell
thee all is well, and that thou

art in an excellent estate: and
God loues thee, and thou art
sure of heauen: this song the
diuell alwayes singes for the
most part, til a man comes to
die, for then hee appeares in
his colours, but till then, hee
laboures to sing, and lull all
men a sleepe in the cradle of
securite. Aske your owne
flesh, and your owne heartes
and natures, and they will
aunswere and say, that all is
well and safe, and that wee
haue beleeued, and loued, and
feared GOD all our dayes.
Aske the worlde, and men in
the world: and they will answere,
all is well; and they
will say further, that thou
art a right good-fellowe, and
art worthe twentie of these
curious fooles that sticke vpon

points, and stand vpon circumstances,
as swearing, and
drinking, and good fellowship,
and gaming, and such other
nice and circumstantiall
points: thus wil worldly men
aunswere: for thy prophane
course is acceptable to them,
because thereby thou approuest
the same in them.
               Nay, goe further, and aske
all humaine Learning in the
world, and it cannot tell thee
what one sinne is, nor what it
is to offende God: so that
there remaines onely the
law of God, the light whereof
will disclose the darkenesse
of our heartes; and the
iustice whereof will reueale
the righteousnesse and the
peruersenesse of our Natures:
therefore to the

Lawe of GOD must wee
flye to helpe vs in this
search.
               And yet for our better
helpe in this dutie, and that
there may bee nothing wanting
to that soule, that seeketh
God, therefore wee are
further to knowe, that if wee
will searche our selues by the
Lawe profitablie, wee must
marke three rules, the truth
whereof vnlesse wee knowe,
acknowledge, and feele: wee
shall neuer see our owne estate,
nor profit by this search,
but plod on from sin to sin,
vntill we plunge into hell.
               The first Rule is, that euerie
man that came from
Adam, sinned in the sinne
of Adam: thou must therefore
knowe, that his sinne

in eating the forbidden fruit,
was thy sinne: and thou sinnedst
therein, as well as hee
(though thou wast then vnborne)
and that thou art guiltie
of it before God, and must
aunswere for it to Gods iustice,
vnlesse Christ doe it
for thee.
               The reason heereof is,
because wee are his seede and
posteritie, wee were then in
his loynes, he was the Father
of vs all: and was not a priuate
man as wee are now, but
a publike person, the pledge
of all mankinde, and bare the
person of vs all at that time:
therefore what hee did then,
he did it for himselfe, and for
vs: what couenant God made
with him, was made for himself
& vs: what God promised

him, and hee to God, he promised
for himselfe, & for vs:
what he receiued for himselfe,
and for vs: and what hee gained
or lost by his fall▪ he gained
& lost for vs, as for himselfe.
Hee lost the fauour of
God, and originall puritie:
therefore he lost it for all his
posteritie: guiltinesse, and
Gods anger, and corruption
of nature which hee gained,
he got for vs all, as well as for
himselfe. If we doubt of this
pointe, it is prooued by the
Apostle: where the holie
Ghost saith; Sinne entred by
one man,
                  Rom. 5. 14. 
                  and death by sinne:
and that sinne went ouer all, and
that it went ouer all them, which
sinned not in the like transgression
with Adam, (that is, euen

our children) who as they are
borne, are borne not onely
tainted with original corruption:
but guilty also of Adams
sinne. This is a most certaine
truth, thogh it seeme strange,
for few men thinke of it, that
euer they shall answere for Adams
sinne: and therefore if
anie obiect, what reason is
there that I answere for another
mans sinne? I answere,
true, if it had beene Adams
sinne alone: but it was his
and thine also: for hee was
thy Father, and stood in thy
roome: and thou also since
thou wast borne, hast confirmed
what hee did.
               Now therefore, though not
one of many thinkes seriouslie
thereof: namely, that hee
shoulde stand guiltie of a

sinne committed fiue thousand
yeares before hee was
borne, yet seeing it is most
true, both in Scripture and
good reason: let euerie man
subscribe in his conscience
to this Truth. And let this
bee thy first Resolution in
this searche, that thou standest
guiltie of Ad
                        •
                     ms transgression.
               The second rule to bee
knowne is, that in euery man
is all sinnes: more plainely,
that in euerie man by nature
are the seedes of all sinnes:
and that not in the worste,
but in the best natured
men: make choyse of the
best man, and the greatest
sinne, and that worst sinne
is to bee founde in that
best man. If anie doubte

of this, let him consider what
originall sinne is, namely, a
corruption of the powers of
our soules; and that not of
some, or in part, but of all, &
wholly. This corruptiō hath
two partes. First, a want, not
of some, but of all good inclination,
a want of all goodnes.
Secondly, a depriuation
and pronenesse, not to some,
but to all euil: & not a pronenes
onely, but originall sinne
infuseth into euery mās heart
the seede of all corruption.
               Manie man stand much vpon
their good meaning, and
vpright heart, and bragge of
a good nature: but they are
foulely deceiued; for take the
ciuilest man vpon the earth,
and the seedes of all sinnes in
the worlde are in him by nature.

But to explain this point
fully, obserue these 2. clauses.
               First, I say not, the practise
of all sinnes, but the seedes;
for all men practise not all
sinne: the seedes are in their
nature: but the practise is restrained,
sometime by education,
sometime by good and
wholsome lawes: somtime the
constitution of mens bodies,
deny the practise of som sins,
somtime the countrie a man
dwelles in, or calling a man
liues in, keepes him from the
practise of some sinnes: and
alwayes a generall and limitting
grace of GOD, restrains
the nature of all men,
from running into manie
sinnes: which hand of God,
if God should take away, and
leaue euerie man to his nature,

wee should see that euerie
man would practise anie
sinne in the world: yea, euen
the greatest sinnes that euer
wee heard to bee done in the
world. All men which knowe
themselues, knowe this to be
true, and the more a man
knowes his owne heart, the
more hee seeth that his heart
is a Sea of all wickednesse:
and that it is the mercie and
grace of God, that hee hath
not fallen into the mightiest
and most monstrous sinnes
in the world.
               Secondly, I say, by nature.
For I knowe by good education,
and by grace, it is otherwise:
Grace rectifieth Nature,
but that is no thankes
to nature: for it is as euill and
corrupt still, beeing seuered

from grace: and therefore
Nature must bee fullie abolished,
afore man come to
heauen. And yet (though all
this be true) I say not that sin
breakes out in all natures alike,
though all natures bee
alike corrupt: for the course
of nature is restrained in some
more then others, by the
meanes aforesaide; but this is
the truth, that whereas some
are not so angrie, some not
so wanton, some not so cruell,
some not so couetous,
some not so ambitious, &c. as
others; that comes not from
anie goodnesse of nature in
them, aboue the other originallie,
but from Gods hand,
which tempereth, restraineth,
and moderateth euerie
mās nature as he seeth good.
               
                  
And if God did not thus
moderate & restraine the natures
of men, but suffer them
to break out to the full: there
would then bee no order, but
all confusion in the worlde;
therefore, (as especiallie for
his Churches quietnes, so also
for the preseruatiō of publike
peace, and the vpholding
of societie in the worlde, betweene
man and man,) the
Lord holds a hand ouer euerie
mans nature, and keepes
euery one in a certaine compasse
limited by the wisdome
of his power, which restraining
hand of his, if the Lord
should take away, all societies
and Common-wealthes,
woulde bee turned vp-side
downe, because euerie man
by the vniuersall corruption

of his Nature, would breake
out into euery sinne: I ende
this point with appealing to
the testimonie of the consciences
of all men, and especiallie
of the best and holyest
men, of whom I would aske
this question: whether they
finde not in their natures an
inclination, euen to the fowlest
sinnes in the worlde; if
shame, or feare, or else the
grace of God restrained
them not? so that the best
men doe know well enough,
what adooe they haue with
their corrupt natures, to keep
them within the compasse of
obedience.
               Nay, I yet adde further, the
nature of men, & of all men,
is so corrupt, since Adam:
that euen the seede of the

sinne against the holy Ghost,
& a pronenesse to it, is in the
nature of euery man (though
not one man amongst manie
thousandes doe commit that
sin,) for seeing in that sinne
there is a heape or Sea of all
sinnes gathered together,
he therefore that hath in his
nature the seede of all sinnes,
hath also the seede of it.
               And againe, seeing that
all euills tendes to a perfection,
as well as Grace doeth;
what reason therefore is
there, but wee may safely
thinke, that the Diuell would
hale euery one to that height
of sinne, if it were not
that the powerfull hande of
God preuented him, who will
neyther suffer wicked men,
nor the Diuell himselfe to

bee so wicked as they coulde,
and would be.
               The vse of this second rule,
is notable. For in this searching
of our selues, it sheweth
vs what wee are, without
all colour or deceit, and fully
discouers vnto vs, the vglines
of our natures: & it may
teach vs all how to think and
esteeme of our selues,Gen. 4. when
we heare of Caines vnnaturall
murther,Exod. 1. 
                  Pharaohs vnnaturall
crueltie,Gen. 8. the Sodomites vnnatural
lust,2. Sam. 15▪ & 16. 
                  Achitophels diuellish
pollicie,Esay. 38. 
                  Senacharibs horrible
blasphemie, Iudas monstrous
treason, Iulians fearefull
Apostasie. When wee
heare of the fearefull murthers,
treasons, periuries,
sinnes against nature, blasphemies,
Apostasies, witchcrafts,

crafts, and other the horrible
sinnes of the worlde: let vs
then returne into our selues,
and looke homewardes, euen
into our owne heartes, and
confesse euerie one that these
should haue beene euen thy
sinnes also, if Gods grace had
not preuented thee.
               This will humble thee, and
make thee thinke vilely and
basely of thy selfe, and so consequently
bring thee to repentance
and true amendement:
and the verie reason,
why men repent not, nor amend
their wayes, is because
they are Pharisies by nature,
and thinke highly of themselues,
and of their owne natures,
and their naturall inclinations:
this will be a harshe
& a strāge doctrine to them;

Oh, they haue excellent narures,
and they canot endure
such, & such sinnes, and they
thanke God, they are not as
ill as others: but let all such
men knowe, they must cease
magnifying nature, & learne
to magnifie Gods grace: Let
them knowe, that nature in
them, is in the roote, as much
corrupt, as in the worst man
in the world, and euerie mans
heart is a bottomlesse fountaine
of all sinne; therefore
praise not thy nature, but
Gods grace and mercie, in giuing
thee so good a nature;
or rather, so well restraining,
and rectifying thy nature; &
stay not there, but desire of
the Lord, that as hee hath giuen
thee a better tempered
nature, then to other men: so

also hee woulde bestowe on
thee his espeiiall and sauing
grace: and as hee hath kept
thee from the fearefull sinnes
of others (thou beeing as ill
naturally as they) so he would
also leade thee into the way of
saluation, which else the best
nature in the worlde can neuer
attaine vnto.
               The third rule to be knowne
and practised of him, who
will truely searche himselfe,
is, that euerie man borne of
Adam, is by nature the children
of wrath, and Gods enemie:
this is true of all without
exception; high or lowe,
rich or poore, Noble or simple,
borne in the visible
church, or without. And further,
by beeing enemie of
God, hee is therefore borne

subiect to hell, to damnation,
and to all other curses: so that
looke as a Traitor conuicted,
stands thereby in his Princes
high displeasure, and is sure
of death without speciall pardon;
so standes euerie man
when hee is borne, conuicted
of high treason against God,
in his high disfauour; and is
in danger of Hell, which is the
fulfilling of the wrath of God.
               Thus Dauid confesseth of
himselfe; I was borne in iniquitie,
and in sinne hath my mother
conceiued mee: If in sinne,
then in Gods wrath, and vnder
the daunger of damnation.
If anie aske, howe, or
why this is so? I answere, the
trueth, as also the equitie of
this third rule dependeth on
the two former: for, because

euery man is borne guiltie of
Adams great sinne, and also
tainted originally with al corruption,
and a pronenesse of
all sinne: therefore it followeth
in equitie and iustice, that
euery man is borne vnder the
wrath and curse of God.
               This point is a plaine and
euident trueth: yet men in
the world thinke not so, and
it is the cause, why men repent
not of their sinnes: for
most men thinke that by nature,
they are in Gods fauour;
and therefore they neede not
so sue for it in humiliation &
repentance; but only liue ciuillie,
and do no open wrong,
and all is well: whereas (alas)
there is no condemned traitour,
more out of his Princes
fauour, nor more sure of

death without a pardon, then
all wee are out of Gods fauour,
and sure of damnation,
vnlesse wee procure Gods fauour
againe, by Faith and Repentance.
               For the better opening of
this third rule, and the manifesting
of the Truth: let vs
knowe further, that the curse
of God, vnder the which wee
all are borne, is three-fold.
               The first, is a bondage vnder
Sathan: It is a certaine
truth, that euerie man as hee
is borne of his Parents, and
till he repent, is a slaue of Sathan:
man or woman, high or
lowe, Sathan is his Lord and
Maister. Hee sits as Iudge in
his heart; and in his sense Sathan
is the king of the natiōs,
and god of the world. Men

wil in words defie Sathan, and
not name him without defiance:
and spit at him; and yet
(alas) hee is in their heartes:
they spitte him out of their
mouthes, but hee is lower;
they should also spit him out
of their heartes, and that is
true defiance indeede: for
alas, he lodgeth in thy heart,
and there hee maketh his
Throne, and reignes vntil the
spirit of regeneration dispossesse
him: and till then, no
seruant is subiect to his maister,
no slaue to his Lorde,
as is the heart of man by nature
vnto Sathan, the Prince
of darkenesse. Nay, our
bondage, is more fearefull,
then the slauerie of anie
poore Christian, in the
Spaniards, or in the Turkes

Gallies: for their bodies are
but in bondage, and at commaund,
and vnder punishment,
but our best part, our
heart, our conscience, our
soule it selfe is captiuated
vnto him, and vnder his commaunde,
who is the king of
crueltie, and confusion, and
lord of hell, whose commandements
are iniustice, whose
seruice is sinne, and whose
hyre is damnation.
               The second part of the
curse of the first death, or the
death of the bodie: that is, a
separation of the soule and
bodie asunder for a time,
namely, til the last iudgemēt.
This death is duely and iustly
the punishment of anie one,
or the least sinne: therefore,
howe due and iust a punishment,

vppon that horrible
heape of sinfulnesse, which
is in euery mans nature? and
it is a most terrible curse. For
it is the very gate of hell, and
the downefall of damnation
vnto all men, but such as by
faith and repentance doe get
their death sanctified by the
death of Christ: vnto such
men indeed it is no curse, but
a gratious and glorious blessing,
for it is altered by Christ
his death. But vnto all men
by nature, and which repent
not, it is the heauie curse of
Gods wrath, and the verie
downe-fall into the gulfe of
hell.
               The third part of the curse
vnder which euerie man is
borne, is, the second death: the
death of soule and bodie;

which is the eternall want of
Gods presence, and the accomplishment
of his wrath:
and an apprehension and feeling
of that wrath, seazing
on bodie, soule, and conscience.
The first curse was a
spirituall death; the death of
the soule. The second, a temporall
death, the death of
the bodie. The third, is an
eternall death, a death both
of soule and bodie together;
and for euer. This eternall
death is the curse of all curses,
the miserie of all miseries,
and torment of all
tormentes: and I shewe
it thus. Often when thy
toothe acheth, and sometime
when thy headacheth,
or in the paine of the stone
or collicke, thou wouldest

giue all that thou hast in the
worlde to bee eased of that
paine: Nay, in the extreamitie
of some fittes, manie will
wish themselues euen out of
the world: Now, if the paine
of one toothe, can so farre distemper
minde and bodie,
that it cannot bee releeued
with all the pleasures of this
life; Oh then, what a torment
shall that bee, when
not one kinde of paine, but
the whole viole of GODS
wrath shall bee powred, not
on one member, but on the
whole soule, bodie, and conscience,
and that not for a
time, vnder hope of better:
but eternallie without
hope of release; and that not
in this world, where there are
comforts, helpes, and remedies:

but in that vglie and
darksome place of torrments:
and that not amongst liuing
men, which might mittigate
thy paine, or else bemone
thee, and bewaile it with thee:
but with the diuells, & dāned
spirits, which will now laugh
at thy destruction, and solace
themselues in this thy miserie,
and will reioyce, as thou
diddest serue them in earth,
so now in hell, to bee thy tormenters.
It may bee therefore
(by the way) a good warning
and wisedome to vs all,
when wee feele the extremitie
of some bodilie paine, to
consider with our selues, and
say; Oh then, what shall
bee my miserie and torment,
if I repent not? when not
one member, but soule,

bodie, and conscience, shall
bee racked and tormented in
the feeling and apprehension
of the anger of the Lorde
of Hostes.
               In these three points stands
that curse and wrath of God,
vnder which euerie man is
borne. And these doe answere
to the three degrees of sinne,
which are in vs: for as the
two first rules taught vs, there
is in euery man by nature, till
hee repent, a threefolde guiltinesse.
First, a guiltinesse of
Adams sinne. Secondly, the
taint of originall & vniuersall
corruption. Thirdly, a pollution
by manie outragious
actuall sinnes. In the first of
these euerie man is equallie
guiltie. In the second, euerie
man is equallie corrupt.

But in the third, euerie one
keepes that compasse, within
which the Lorde will keepe
them by his limiting power.
               Now as in our guiltinesse of
Adams sinne, sinne hath his
beginning: in original sinne,
his continuance: in actuall
sinne, his perfect on: So answerable
herevnto, the wrath
of God (which alwayes standeth
opposite to sinne) is begunne
in leauing vs by nature
to the slauerie of Sathan, is
continued by death, and is accomplished
in damnation.
               And nowe these three
rules, I commend to the carefull
and Christian consideration
of you all: certifying
you from God, that as you
can neuer bee saued, vnlesse
you repent: nor repent, vnlesse

you searche your selues,
(as heere the Prophet biddeth.)
So, that you can neuer
search your selues aright, till
you be perswaded, and resolued
of these three rules, & of
the truth of them all, euen in
your hearts and consciences:
Namely; First, that thou art
guiltie of Adams sinne. Secōdly,
that thou art prone by
nature to all euil in the world.
Thirdly, that for these thou
art subiect to the wrath of
God, and to all the curses of
his wrath: but when thou art
in heart & conscience resolued,
that these are true; then
thou art a fit scholler, for this
Lesson of the Prophet, Search
thy selfe. For when thou
goest, thus prepared vnto
this Search, and esteemest

of thy selfe, as the three
Rules haue described thee:
then if thou Search into thy
selfe, thou wilt finde thy selfe,
and thy estate to bee such, as
will cause thee to repent, returne
and take a newe course:
therefore what the Prophet
saide to those Iewes, I say vnto
you also, My brethren of
this Realme of England, who
are now heere gathered together,
out of so manie countryes,
and quarters of this
Realme: yea, in the name of
the same God, I cry vnto you;
Search. O Search your selues:
and thinke it not a matter indifferent
to doe, or not to doe
it? but knowe it, that God
commands you, as euer you
wil come to saluation: Search
your selues. And the rather,

because by these three Rules
you see howe much chaffe of
corruption is in your nature,
and what neede therefore it
hath to be searched into, and
fanned by Repentance. Bee
well assured thou man, whatsoeuer
thou art: there is so
much chaffe in thee, that if
thou search not, and fanne it
not out, thou wilt prooue nothing
but Chaffe at the last
day, and so be blowne away
with the winde of Gods iustice
into Hell. Take holde
therfore of this exhortation,
and deferre it not.
               Thou wilt not suffer thy
Wheate to lye too long in
the chaffe, for feare of hurting
it: Is it then safe to suffer
the Chaffe of thy sinnes
and corruptions to lye cankering

and rotting in thy
heart? Be sure that that little
portion of grace, which thou
attainest vnto, by liuing in
the Church, and vnder the
ministery of the word of God,
will bee putryfied, and cleane
corrupted with the Chaffe of
thy sinnes: therefore againe,
and againe, I exhorte you to
make conscience of this dutie:
Search into your selues,
fanne out this chaffe, this presumption
of ours, and high
esteeming of our owne nature,
and conceites of Gods
fauour before we haue it: that
so this Chaffe beeing blowne
away, the Lord may then bestowe
vpon vs soundnesse of
grace, and the foundation of
all goodnesse, which is a holy
and humbled heart.
               
                  
                  Saluation is such a building,
as the foundation thereof had
neede to bee sure and strong:
Ignorance, blindenesse, and
presumption, are not sufficient
foundations for such a
building: therefore as no
man wil build a strong house
vpon anie earth, but hee will
first search it, least it prooue
sandie, and so ouerthrowe all:
So a wise Christian will not
build his saluation, vpon fancies
and conceits, and naturall
presumptions: but will
Search, and looke into his
heart: and finding these to be
sandie, and rotten, and therefore
too weake for the foundation
of so glorious a building,
will refuse them all, and
labour to furnish his heart
with such sounde grace, as

wherevpon hee may trust so
weightie a worke, as is the
saluation of his soule. Againe,
if thou wilt stande in the day
of triall, then search thy heart
betime, and discerne betwixt
chaffe and wheate: thou seest,
that chaffe flyeth away before
the winde; but good
corne indures the Fanne, and
the furie of the winde: so in
the day of triall, temptation,
sickenesse, or open persecution,
the chaffe of naturall presumption,
and outward formalitie
in Religion, will flye
away: and it must be the penitent,
humbled, and beleeuing
heart, which must then
abide it out, and endure the
Fan of temptations and persecutions.
               And to conclude, Let

not the Diuell deceiue thee,
in making thee imagine or
hope to please God, and yet
to let thy corruptions lie vnseene,
and thy sinnes vnsearched
out, least thereby thou
marre all: for thou vsest not
to laye vp wheate in thy garners,
vntill it be purged from
the chaffe: so thinke not to
store vp anie sauing knoweledge,
or anie other grace of
God in thy heart, vntill the
Chaffe of vanitie bee first
blowne away, that so, the holie
graces of God may be laid
vp in the garners of thy soule.
               And therefore questionlesse,
(to speake one worde to
touche our common professors,
in the verie sore of their
soules) all knowledge that is
stored vp in these vnpure and

vnsearched hearts: is euen as
wheate layd vp in the chaffe,
which is, (a thousand to one)
sure to bee eaten vp by the
chaffe, so that, when the winnowing
time of triall and persecution
comes: I feare, that
such men will (for all their
knowledge) shrinke aside, and
betraye the Trueth: their
knowledge then prouing no
better then chaffe, because it
was layde vp in an vnholie
heart. If therefore thou
wouldest stande and endure,
when Poperie, or persecution,
or temptations come, if
thou wouldest abide the furie
of the fanne of temptations:
nowe then exercise thy heart
with the fanne of Gods lawe,
Search and ransacke it, purge
out the chaffe of corruption,

and store vp knowledge in an
holie heart, and a good conscience,
and that will abide
the violence of all temptations:
yea, when God suffers
the Diuell to doe with vs, as
hee did with Peter, to winnowe
vs like wheate, to sifte
and trie vs, as he did Iob, with
the furious winde of all his
malice: then knowledge will
prooue Wheate, that will abide
the winde, and gold that
will abide the fire: thus glorious
will it bee in the ende,
if wee followe this holie Prophets
counsell, and Search
our hearts.
               ¶And thus much for the first
pointe (namely) the dutie of searching
heere commaunded, in
which we haue stayed the longer,

because it is the foundation of
all the rest: and this beeing well
layde, the whole building will goe
vp the faster.
            
            
               Now wee come to the second
generall point here laid
downe: that is, whom must
wee Search? the Prophet answereth:
your selues, not other
men, but your selues. This
search so vrged and inforced
by the Prophet, must not bee
of other mens hearts & liues,
but of our owne: our owne
are our charge, and not other
mens: and therein is the saying
true, which else is most
false: Euery man for himselfe:
for as euerie soule must bee
saued by it selfe, so must it beleeue,
repent, and search it
selfe.
               
                  
The dutie therefore here
commaunded, is for euerie
man that woulde haue his
soule to be saued, to search
it, and reforme it, & leaue others
to be searched by themselues.
Here the holy Ghost
meets with the common corruption
of this world, (and
that is) that men are Eagle
eyed, to see into the liues of
other men, but to looke into
their owne heartes, and liues,
they are blinder then Moles:
they can see moates in other
mens liues, but discerne not
beames in their owne: whereby
it comes to passe, that they
stumble and fall fowlie: for
the eyes of most men are set
vpon others, and not vppon
themselues: and therevpon it
is, that an euill man, seeing oother

men, and not himselfe:
thinkes best of himselfe, and
worst of other men: but contrariwise,
a good man seeing
himselfe, and not other men,
thinkes worst of himselfe,
and better of other men: an
euill man lookes outward,
and iudgeth other men: but
a good man lookes homeward
and iudgeth himselfe:
and in iudging, condemnes
himselfe, farre aboue other
men: and that because by
searching into his owne heart
and waies, he knowes that by
himselfe, which he knowes
not by any man in the world
besides.
               So then wee must search,
not other mē, but our selues:
our owne hearts & our owne
liues are our charge, and burthen:

the liues of other men
concerne vs not, being priuate
men, further then either
to follow them being good,
or take heede of them being
euill: but to search, or be inquisitiue
into them, is no dutie
commaunded vs, but rather
a foule and a base vice
forbidden of God. Indeede
Magistrates in their people,
Pastours in their congregations,
and housholders in
their families are to search:
but they can search onely for
criminall causes, to open
actuall sinnes: but this searching
must be of our hearts,
which no man can search,
but our selues onely. Fewe
men haue a calling to enquire
into other mens liues,
but euery man hath a calling

to search into himselfe: but
(alas) men doe farre otherwise,
they suffer themselues
to rotte in their owne sinnes,
and erect an Inquisition ouer
other mens liues, and it is
to be seene in daily experience,
that those men, who
are the great Searchers and
pryers into other men, are
the neglecters and forgetters
of themselues. And contrariwise,
they who doe narrowly
Search themselues and their
owne wayes, and looke into
the corners of their owne
hearts, doe finde so much
worke to doe with themselues,
that they little busie
themselues, wi
                     •
                  h other
men.
               And thus much may suffice
for that point.
            
            
               
               It followeth.
               
                  O Nation not worthy to be beloued.
               
               The third point: Who must
search? the Iewes, who are
here termed a Nation, not
worthy to be beloued: and
yet for all that, they are bid to
search themselues, that so
vpon their repentance, they
might be beloued. Where,
we may see the vnspeakable
loue of God, and his wonderfull
mercy, offering grace
vnto such men, as are altogether
vnworthy of it. Gods
children are by nature like
other men, and God findes
nothing in them, why to
respect them aboue other:

but euen of his owne mercy,
makes them worthy, who of
themselues are not: therefore
how worthy is that God, to
haue all the loue of our harts,
who loued vs, when we were
not worthy to be beloued.
               But let vs examine more
particularly, why God doth
call the Iewes a Nation, not
worthy to be beloued: I answere,
God had blessed them
aboue other Nations: Hee
gaue them his couenant of
grace, & thereby made them
his people, and committed
to their trust, his holy word
and Oracles:Rom. 3. 2. but he delt not
so with other Nations, neither
had the heathen knowledge
of his lawes. Besides
all this,Ps. 143. 20. they hadde a better
land then others about them,

it flowed with Milke, and
Honie, (that is, with all commodities,
and delights) and
though their Countrie was
but little, yet themselues so
populous, and so powerfull,
that whilest they pleased
God, no enemie durst set vpon
then.
               Thus for soule and body,
they were euery way a Nation,
blessed of God, a people
beloued of God aboue
all others. Now, how did this
people (thus beloued of their
God,) requite this his loue,
which they had no more deserued,
then any other Nation?
Certainely, as they deserued
it not afore they had it,
so they requited it not when
they had it: but requited this
loue of God with sinne,

with rebellion, and with disobedience.
They tempted
him, they prouoked him to
wrath, they presumed of his
mercy, and proued a most
stubborne & stifnecked people,
a froward generation:
Moses partly saw this in his
owne experience, and better
discerned it in the spirite of
Prophesie: and therefore,
wondring at this their wickednes,
he cried out; Do you
thus requite the Lord: O foolish
people and vnwise? thus, that
is, with sin, and disobedience,
which is the onely meanes to
displease the Lord, & to prouoke
him to wrath: for this
cause they are worthily called
a foolish and vnkind people
by Moses, and here, by the
Prophet. A Nation not worthy

to be beloued: namely, for
their vnthankefulnesse, and
vnkindnes: which was such,
as they not onely were slacke,
and carelesse in performance
of such duties as God required:
but euē multiplyed their
sinnes, and committed those
soule rebellions, which his
soule hated.
               And amongst many, the
Prophet here in this Chapter,
noteth three of their
great sinnes: for which they
were a Nation not worthy
to be beloued. Couetousnesse,
Crueltie▪ and Deceit: all which
were the more hainous and
intollerable, because they
were the sinnes of their Princes,
their rulers, and their
Priests, who should haue bin
lights & examples to the rest.
               
                  
Now, although euery sinne
in it selfe, is of that ill desert,
as it is able to cast vs out of
Gods fauour, and depriue vs
of his loue: yet, behold, here
God complaines, not vppon
a little cause, but for wonderfull,
and exceeding vnthankfulnes,
& vnkindnes in them:
who of all other should haue
loued the Lord.
               As a man cares not for
hard vsage from him, whom
he esteemes not: but a little
vnkindnesse dooth greatly
greeue a man, from him who
is loued and respected: so is it
with the Lord our God, hee
loued not the Gentiles, as
hee did the Iewes,Psal. 147. neither
was hee so bountifull vnto
them:Acts 17. verse. 30. and therefore, (as wee
may see) though they liued

alwayes in ignorance, and
continued alwaies in disobedience;
yet, the Text saith,
the time of that ignorance
God regarded not: but when
as the Iewes, his owne people,
whom hee chose out of
all people, and bestowed his
loue vpon them, and made
his Couenant of grace with
them, when they became vnkind,
vnthankfull, forgetfull,
stubborne, and rebellious,
that caused the Lord euen to
complaine of that indignitie,
and to cry out by Moses, Doe
ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish
people and vnwise? And
heereby the Prophet, O
Nation not worthy to be beloued:
and therefore there is no
man, but if he be asked what
hee thinkes of this Nation of

the Iewes: he will aunswere,
that they are a most vile and
wicked people, a froward
generation, and that they are
worthy to taste deepely of
all Gods plagues, who so
farre abused his loue and
mercy.
               But what doth this belong
to them alone? and is Israel
a Nation not worthy to bee
beloued? Nay, I may cry out
with as good cause: O England,
a Nation not worthy to
be beloued: For, God hath
beene as good a God to vs,
as he was to them: and wee
haue beene as vnkind a people
to him, as they were to
him. But that I may be free
from discrediting our natiō, &
frō defiling my owne nest: let
vs prooue both these points,

and laye them open to the
viewe of the world.
               1. First therefore, the same
mercies, and farre greater,
haue beene powred and heaped
vpon vs: hee hath called
vs out of the dareknes: First,
of Heathenisme, and then of
Popery: his couenant of
grace and saluation, he hath
confirmed with vs, his treasures
of his word and Sacraments,
hee hath imparted to
vs, his holy word neuer better
preached, and the mysteries
thereof neuer more
plainly opened, since the
time of the Apostles: and as
wee haue Religion, so wee
haue it vnder a Religious
Prince, whereby it comes to
passe, that these blessings of
saluation, we enioy not in secret,

or by stealth: but we haue
it coūtenanced by authority;
so that religion is not barely
allowed, but euen as it were
euen thrust vpon men. Besides
all this, wee haue a land
also that floweth with milke
and hony, it is plentifull in
all good things: wee haue liberty
& peace vnder a peaceable
Prince, and the companions
of peace, prosperitie,
plenty, health, wealth, corne,
wooll, golde, siluer, aboundance
of all things, that may
please the heart of man: thus
hath God deserued the loue
of England.
               2. But now England, how
hast thou requited this kindnesse
of the Lord? certainely
euen with a great measure of
vnkindnesse: that is, with

more and greater sinnes then
euer Israel did: so that if Moses
spake true of them, then
may our Moses much more
truly cry out against England,
doest thou thus requite the
Lord, thou foolish people?
And if this prophet said thus
of Israel for three sinnes, then
may it be saide of England for
three hundred sinnes (O England)
a Nation not worthy to
bee beloued: for thou hast
multiplied thy transgressions,
aboue theirs of Israel; euen
as though thou hadst resolued
with thy self, the more
Gods kindnes is heaped on
thee, the more to multiply
thy sinnes against him. For
thou England, as thou hast requited
the Lord with sins; so
not with a fewe sinnes, or smal

sinnes, or sinnes, which hardly
could haue bene preuented:
for that had beene a matter of
some excuse, or not of so
great complaint. But thy sins
are many, and grieuous, and
capitall. And which is worst
of all, wilfull and affected, euen
as though God had deserued
euill of vs: and that
therefore wee ought malitiously
to requite him.
               If any man make doubt of
this, and therefore thinke I
speake too hardly of our
Church: I will thē deale plainly
and particularly, and rip vp
the sores of our Nation, that
so they may be healed to the
bottome.
               The common sinnes of
England, wherewith the
Lord is requited, are these.
               
                  
First, ignorance of Gods
will and worship, (I speake
not of that compelled ignorance
in many corners of our
land, which is to bee pittied
because they want the means)
but wilfull and affected ignorance.
Men are ignorant,
euen because they will be ignorant.
Meanes of knowledge
were neuer so plentiful,
and yet neuer more grosse
ignorance: is not he wilfully
blind, who will not open his
eyes in the light? & can there
bee any darknesse at noone
day, but it must bee wilfull?
But our Nation is darke and
blinde in the Sunne-shine of
the Gospell, and grosly ignorant,
when the Gospell beats
their eares, and light shines
round about them: so, as if

they closed not their eyes,
and stopped not their eares,
they coulde not but both
heare and see: who woulde
look for ignorance after thirty
fiue yeares preaching? and
yet, many are as ignorant, as
if they had beene borne and
brought vp vnder popery: so
that our people are as euill as
those in the dayes of Christ,
of whome the holy Ghost
saith; Light is come into the
world, but men loue darknesse
more then light. So knowledge
is come into England: but
many English-men loue
darknesse better then knowledge.
Alas, how many thousands
haue we in our Church,
who know no more in religion,
then they heare in common
talke of all men, and

which is worse, they thinke it
sufficiēt also, & which is worst
of all, wheras they might haue
more, they will not, but care
not for it.
               2. The second maine sin
of England, is Contempt of
Christian Religion; Religion
hath bin among vs these fiue
and thyrtie yeares; but the
more it is published, the
more it is contemned, and reproched
of many; insomuch,
as there is not the simplest
fellow in a Country towne,
who, although he knows not
one point of religion, yet hee
can mock and scorne such as
are more religious then himselfe
is: this is one of the
moaths of England, that eates
vp religion, this is grieuous
in whomsoeuer, but most intollerable

in two sortes of
men. First, in them, who are
altogether ignorant, that they
should mocke they knowe
not what. A pittifull thing to
here one, who himselfe cannot
giue the meaning of one
petition in the Lords prayer,
to vpbraide other men, because
they are too forward:
but it is the worst of all, when
men of knowledge, and such
as liue ciuilly, and would be
counted good Christians, are
indeed of the better sort, cannot
abide to see others goe a
little before them: but if they
doe, presently they are hypocrites
and dissemblers.
Thus not prophanenesse,
nor wickednes, but euen religion
it selfe is a by-word, a
mocking stocke, and matter

of reproach; so that in England
at this day, the man or
woman that begins to professe
Religion, and to serue
God, must resolue with himselfe
to sustaine mockes and
iniuries, euen as though hee
liued among the enemies of
religion, and not among professours;
and as religion increaseth
and spreadeth it selfe,
so doth the number of these
mockers. O what a cursed
sinne is this? to contemne the
greatest fauour that God can
giue vs, that is, his holy religion:
for the which we should
rather praise him all the daies
of our liues. All that God
can giue a man in this world,
is his Gospell, what then can
God giue to bee regarded,
whē his Gospell is cōtemned?
               
                  
This sinne was neuer amongst
the Iewes: they indeede
regarded it not so as
it deserued, but who did euer
make a mocke and a scorne
of it but England? O England,
how canst thou answere
this? God sendes thee the
most precious iewell, that he
can sende to a Nation; and
thou scornest it, & them that
bring it, and them that receiue
it; euen as though it
were no blessing, but a curse:
so that as Christ saith to the
Iewes,Iohn. 10. 32 
                  For which of my good
workes doe you stone me? So may
the Lord say to England, I
haue giuen thee a fruitfull
land, a blessed Prince, golde
and siluer, peace and liberty,
plentie and prosperitie: for
which of these (O England)

doest thou contemne my religion?
The least of these deserue
loue; but England hath
a better then all these; that is,
his Gospell, the word of saluation:
and yet, that all is
contemned (as beeing nothing
worth) and those
which confesse it, and those
that bring it, and consequently,
God himselfe that
giue it. If England had no
more sinnes but this: this deserues,
that it should be saide
of vs, that wee are a Nation
not worthy to be beloued aboue
all Nations: for some Nations
woulde haue religion,
that they might loue it, but
they cannot haue it: some
haue it, and loue it not: but
in no Nation is it made a
mocking-stocke, but in

England. And where are
those men, but in England,
who (like the dog in the manger)
will neyther entertaine
religion themselues, nor suffer
them that would: let vs
in time take heede of this
sinne, as a sinne that crieth
to God, to reuenge so vile a
dishonour done to his Maiestie:
neyther is there any
sinne that more certainely
foreshowes, and more forcibly
hastens the remoouing
of the Gospell from vs. For
high time is it to cease louing,
where loue procures
disdaine: And to stay giuing,
where gifts are scorned.
               Carrie home this lesson
to your great Townes and
Cities where you dwell,There were then present inhabitants of London. for in

these populous places,York, Cambridge, Oxford, Norwich, Bristow, Ipswich, Colchester, Worcester, Hull, Lin, Manchester, Kendal, Couentry, Nottingham, Northampton, Bath., Lincolne, Darby L
                        •
                     icester, Chester, Newecastle, & of many other most populous cities & Townes of England. are
these great mockers, for
where God hath his professours,
the Diuell hath his
mockers; and repent betimes
of this sinne, for holde on in
mocking, and bee sure that
God (who will not bee mocked)
will remooue his Gospel
from you; but if you leaue
this sinne, and entertaine the
Gospell (as it worthilie deserueth,)
then be sure of it, that
God wil continue the Gospel,
to you, and your posterity after
you, in the face of all your
enemies round about you.
               3. The thirde common
sinne of England, is Blasphemie,
manie wayes, but especiallie
in vaine swearing, false
swearing, and for-swearing,
and the abuse of all the names

and titles of the Lorde God.
This sinne is generall, euen
ouer the whole land, especiallie
in Fayres, and Markets,
where men for a little gaine,
will not care to call the Lord
of Hostes to be witnesse to a
lye, and the God of truth to
testifie an vntruth.
               And which is worst of all,
Gods holie Name is vsed in
vaine oathes, and ordinarie
talke; when men haue no
cause to sweare at all: so that
it is most lamentable to see
and obserue, that the name of
any man of honour, or worship,
is vsed more reuerently,
& lesse abused, then that fearfull
and glorious name: the
Lord our God.
               
               4. The fourth generall and
great sinne is, prophanation of

the Sabbaoth. A common
sinne euerie where, and yet
so great a sinne, that where it
raignes, in that countrey, congregation,
family, man or woman,
there is no feare of God,
nor anie true grace in them:
for the keeping of the Sabbaoth,
is the maintaining, increasing,
and publishing of religion.
               5. The fifth sinne of our
Nation, is, euill dealing in bargaining
betwixte man and man.
How hard a thing is it to finde
an honest, simple, plaine dealing
man? and that euen in
such great assemblies as this
is. I feare present experience
will testifie: you are nowe
manie thousandes gathered
together, some to buy, some
to sell, some to exchaunge:

Remember that I haue tolde
you, an honest hearted and
plaine dealing man is harde
to finde: therefore labour to
approoue your selues sincere
hearted men; remember the
counsell of the holie Ghost;
Let no man oppresse nor defraude
his brother in bargaining: for the
Lorde is the auenger of all such
thinges. These sinnes are generall
and vniuersall as a canker:
And so are the sinnes of
the sixe, seuen▪ & eight Commaundements,
(though they
bee not altogether so common
as these bee) Murthers,
Adulteries, Vsuries, Briberies,
Extorsions, Cosonages, they are
a but then vnder which, our
earth grones; and they crie
against vs to heauen, so that
vpon as good or much better

cause may it be saide to vs, as
to the Iewes: O Nation not worthy
to be beloued.
               
               Looke at the outward face
of our Church, at the signes
of Gods loue, which are amongst
vs, and at Gods dealing
with vs; and behold, we
are a beautifull church, a glorious
Nation, a Nation to be
admired, and wondred at: but
looke at the liues of our ordinary
professours, looke at
our sinnes, and at our requiting
of Gods loue: and wee
are a people of Sodome, as full
of iniquities as they were,
whose sinnes were so manie,
so rise, and so ripe; that at
the last they will euen bring
downe fire and brimstone, or
some other strange iudgemēt
vpon vs, if repentance do not

preuent it, or the cryes and
prayers of holy men stay not
Gods hand. So then, let vs all
here assembled, grant & confesse,
that wee are a Nation so
farre from beeing worthie to
bee beloued, as that wee are
most worthie to be hated, and
to haue all the wrath of God
powred vpon vs.
               Now then, are wee so? and
shall wee continue so still?
Nay, that is the worst, and
most wretched of all: then
let euery one of vs learne this
dutie, enter into our selues,
search our hearts and liues,
that they may lie open to our
owne sight, to the confusion
of vs in our selues, that in
God by repentance wee may
be raised vp.
               Our sinnes lye open before

the face of God, and
stinke in his presence, and
crie for vengeance: and before
the face of Gods Angels,
who bewaile it, & before the
face of the Diuell, who reioyceth
in our confusions: and
shall they lye hidde onely to
our selues? Now then, if
wee would haue them hidden
from God, and stoppe the cry
that they make against vs,
and keepe them from Sathan,
who accuseth vs for them; we
must so search our selues, that
they may lye open vnto our
owne heartes: Remember
thou thy sinnes, and GOD
will forget them: laye them
open before thine owne face,
and GOD will hyde them
from his: write them vp for
thy owne selfe, and God will

blot them out of his remembrance:
but if contrarywise
thou hidest them, then assure
thy selfe, the more thou hydest
& buriest them, the more
open doe they lye in the face
of God: and then what will
followe, but that they will all
bee disclosed at the last day,
to thine eternall confusion.
Therfore againe, and againe,
I exhorte you in the name of
God, Search your selues,
finde out your sinnes, confesse
them to God freely, and
ingeniouslie: confesse their
deserts to be hell and damnation,
humble your heartes to
God, crye and call for pardon,
as for life and death,
purpose and promise to leaue
them, begin a newe course of
life, beleeue stedfastlie, and

doubt not but of pardon and
forgiuenesse in the blood of
Christ, continue in that faith,
and that newe course of life:
So may Englande preuent
Gods iudgements, & quench
that great action of vnkindenes
which God hath against
them, and become a Nation
as worthie (vpon their faith
and repentance) in Christ to
be beloued: as for their peace
and prosperitie, they haue
beene of all Nations of the
earth admired.
               Hitherto of the third generall
point.
            
            
               4. The fourth generall
point in this exhortation, is
time limitted them, when
they should Search. Before

the Decree come forth, &c. As
though the Prophet should
say, Israel, repent before God
execute his iudgementes on
thee. For beholde the gratious
dealing of God: Man
sinneth, his sinnes deserue
plagues: but God presently
plagueth not, but deferres it,
hee puts a time betwixte the
sinne and the punishment
(ordinarily:) this hee doeth
to shewe his mercie vnto
mankinde, because that he
would not destroy them, if
they would amende. Therefore,
after the sinne, he smites
not presently, but puts off his
punishment, that in the mean
time man may repent. Here
the Prophet compares the
Lorde to a mother, for as she
conceiues the fruite in her

wombe, and beares it a long
time, ere shee bring it out: so
the Lord after a mans sinnes,
or a peoples sinn
                     •
                  s, conceiue
(that is) ordaines, and decreeth
a iudgement for it, but
hee keepes it vp, and all that
while hee beares it: But as
shee, when her time is come,
then trauailes and bringes
foorth: So, when the time
that God hath appointed, is
come, and still sinne not repented
of: then his iustice
trauailes to bee deliuered of
that iudgement, which mercie
hath kept vp so long a
time. Thus the olde worlde
had an hundred and twentie
yeares giuen them, for time
of repentance; all that while
God was in conceiuing, at
last when their sinnes were

ripe, and no hope of amendment:
then God trauelled,
and brought forth a fearefull
byrth, namely, the vniuersall
flood, to wash away, and take
reuenge vpon the vniuersall
iniquities of those times. So
mame hundreth yeares hee
gaue vnto the Iewes, long hee
was in conceiuing their destruction,
and oftentimes he
had it at the bringing foorth,
as in the captiuity of Babylon,
and vnder Antiochus; yet
his mercie stayed it: and still
hee trauailed longer: telles
them heere by the Prophet,
that yet the Decree is not
come foorth (though it bee
conceyued:) but at last
when Israel woulde not Repent,
but grewe worse, and
worse; as in CHRIST

his time) then hee could containe
no longer, but trauelled
indeed, and though it be with
griefe, yet hee hath brought
forth: and what? a most fearefull
birth, euen an vtter desolation
of that Kingdome and
Countrey, of their Cittie, and
Temple, and a dispersion of
this nation ouer all the world:
but as a woman at last is deliuered
with daunger and difficultie,
with paine and sorrowe:
so the Lord long conceiues,
but at last brings forth
his iudgements: yet is it with
griefe and vnwillingnes, and
hee is loath (as it were) and
much grieued to execute his
most iuste iudgementes on
those, who haue professed
his name: hee often touched
the Iewes a little, and as beeing

vnwilling to smite them:
hee drewe backe his hand againe:
but at last when their
sinnes did so increase, & were
so strong, that they euen did
wring out by violence his
plagues from him, then with
much bewailing of their great
miserie (as wee may see in
Christ weeping for them) hee
executes his iudgementes on
them. But as they are long
a comming: so, when they
come foorth, they were the
heauier; as a childe, the more
fulnesse of time it hath, is the
greater, the liuelier, and the
stronger: so, Gods iudgements,
the longer God deferreth
them, & is in conceiuing
them, the heauier are
they, when they come: that is
manifest in the Iewes, once

his owne people, for hee hath
destroyed their land, with an
irrecouerable destruction, &
smitten their posteritie, with
a blindnesse of minde till this
houre, so that to this daye,
when the olde Testament is
read, the vaile is ouer their
eyes, that they cannot see the
light of Christ Iesus, but plod
on in fearefull and palpable
blindenesse.
               This doctrine hath speciall
vse to this our Church,
to teache vs to looke to our
selues betimes, and trye our
owne woyes, and turne to the
Lord, for we cannot tell how
farre off his iudgements are:
in reason they must needes
bee neare, they haue beene
so long deferred, and yet
beene so iustlie deserued of

vs. Certainely, God hath
long beene in conceyuing
iudgementes and plagues for
the sinnes of England, and often
hath Gods hande beene
vpon vs, by Warre, Famine,
Pestilence, In-vndations: and
yet it hath beene puld backe
againe: and his sword hath
beene put vp into his sheathe,
and God hath stayed his
byrth, euen in the verie trauell,
and wee haue escaped,
euen as a man, whose necke
hath beene vpon the blocke,
and the Axe holden vppe to
strike: so then, yet the day
is not come, yet wee haue
time: happie wee that euer
wee sawe this daye, if nowe
wee haue grace to repent,
and Searche our heartes, for

then wee shall stay his iudgement
decreed, that it shall neuer
come forth against vs:
but if wee deferre to repent,
put off from day to day, and
lie rotting still in our sinnes:
then knowe and bee assured,
that as the Decree is established,
so it must needes come
foorth, and the stroke stricken,
Repentance is too late:
therefore what hee said to the
Iewes, I say vnto vs, Search
thy selfe O England: (a Nation
not worthie to bee beloued)
before the Decree come foorth,
which is alreadie past against
thee.
               Thus much for the
fourth point.
            
            
               5. Now followeth the last
point: the reason of all. Why

should wee searche our selues?
The reason is included in the
fourth point: For there is a
decree come forth against thee.
And although the execution
be defeated, and though God
bee vnwilling to take it out,
yet without repentance, it is
most certaine, it shall come
forth, and be executed at the
last. In one word, this is the
reason. Repent, or else certainely
God will take vengeance:
But (will mans heart
say) is this true? Or rather
these bee but wordes to feare
men, and to keepe them in
awe. I answere, for proofe and
experience hereof, neuer goe
further 
                     〈◊〉
                   this place, and
present example wee haue in
hand, the Prophet bids them
Search, Search, and Repent,
                  
else, as certainely as there was
a iudgement conceiued, so
certainely it should be executed
vpon them: they would
not heare, nor Search, nor
repent: but what followed;
let all men iudge, whether
God is not true of his worde
to them or no: yea alas,
who seeth not that God hath
trauelled indeede, and hath
brought foorth a fearefull
iudgement on them, and
hath made them for these
thousand yeares, and a halfe,
the gazing-stocke, the byword,
and the amazement of
all the world.
               Thus was it threatened to
the Iewes, and thu
                     〈…〉
                   is performed:
and certainely thus
hath it beene threatned, and

thus shall it bee performed to
thee, Oh England, except
thou preuent the iudgements
that are comming: Oh happie
England, that I may say
vnto thee, it is yet but comming.
For as for the miserable
Iewes, vppon them (alas)
it is come alreadie: vnto
those poore soules it can bee
saide no more, Repent before
the Decree come foorth: for it
is nowe past: but thou art
happie, for thy Day is not
yet come: yet I may say vnto
thee, Repent before the
Decree come foorth: and Oh
happie England, that thou
mavest heare this worde:
(Before) sounding in thine
eares.
               Therefore my beloued

brethren, who are heere assembled
out (almost) of euerie
corner of this Kingdome,
heare my wordes: and carrie
them home with you into all
Countryes, God is the same
God still, as iust, & as iealous,
as euer he was: our sinnes are
as ill, nay, much viler then the
Iewes were: howe can it bee
then, but that must fall to vs
that fell to them? therefore
the zeale of Gods glorie, and
my desire of your saluations,
make me, that I dare not flatter,
but tell you the truth: that
is, that out of all question, if
wee search not our selues and
Repent: there is a generall
iudgement in preparing for
vs: certainly the Decree is out,
and what can stop the execution
of it, but Repentance: God

hath long spared, and he hath
bene long in trauelling, therfore
(though nothing can bee
saide in way of Prophesie) I
am in my conscience perswaded
to feare, & that out of infallible
grounds of the word
of God, that a plague, and a
iudgement, and that moste
fearefull, hangs ouer England:
and that it is alreadie pronounced
vppon this Nation,
and shall bee as certainely executed,
without a visible reformation:
and because I
may seeme to speake somewhat
large, giue mee leaue to
giue you the reasons inducing
me herevnto.
               1. First, the Gospell hath
bene preached these fiue and
thirty yeares, & is daily more
and more, so that, the light

therefore neuer shone more
gloriouslie, since the Primitiue
Church: yet for all this,
there is a generall ignorance,
generall of all people, generall
of all points, yea, as thogh
there were no Preaching at
all: yea, when Poperie was
newely bannished, there was
more knowledge in manie,
then is nowe in the bodie of
our Nation: and the more it
is preached, the more ignorāt
are many, the more blind,
and the more hardened (euen
as a Stithie the more it is beaten
vppon, the harder it is) so
they, the more they heare the
Gospell, the lesse esteeme
they it, and the more they
contemne it: and the more
God calles, the deaffer they
are: and the more they are

commaunded, the more they
disobey. We Preachers may
crie till our Lunges flye out,
or bee spent within vs, and
men are mooued no more
then stones. Oh alas, what
is this, or what can this bee:
but a fearefull signe of destruction?
Will anie man endure
alwayes to bee mocked?
then howe long hath GOD
beene mocked? Will anie
man endure to stande knocking
continuallie? If then
God hath stoode knocking at
our heartes fiue and thirtie
yeares: it is nowe time to
be gone, vnlesse we open presently?
               But if wee will knowe
what this argueth, to contemne
the Gospell, and not to
repent, when the Word is so

abundantly preached: reade
the Storie of Elie, his wicked
sonnes. He spake vnto them,
and gaue them godlie counsaile,
but they hearkened not vnto
the voyce of their father: But
will some say, that is no great
matter, not to heare their Father
a common thing: but
marke what followeth.1. Sam. 2. 13. 
                  They
would not heare their father, because
the Lorde woulde destroy
them: a fearefull thing. Euen
so it is with a nation, or a people:
are they taught, and are
they worse and worse? take
heede: If Elyes sonnes obey
not, it is, because God will destroy
them.
               If therefore Elie, and many
Elyes haue spoken to England,
and England heares not, England
obeyeth not, England repents

not: take heede the
the Lord in heauen say not,
England will not heare the voice
of the Prophets, because I will destroy
it. Let no mā say, we take
vpon vs to prophesie: we onely
giue warning, and shew the
danger, by example of the
like.
               My second reason is this.
One iudgement executed,
and not working repentance,
is alwaies a fore-runner of an
other: that Rule is certaine,
and an euident truth, & needs
no prouing. Now, wee haue
beene visited with famines,
Earth-quakes, pestilences,
invndations, Thunder and
lightnings in winter, and most
straunge and vnseasonable
weather: but alas, all these
haue taken no effect: where

is the humiliation, Repentance
and reformation
which they haue wrought?
therefore it must needes bee,
there remains behind a greater
iudgement. Men may be
so madde to thinke these to
be ordinarie things, and to
come by course of Nature,
and ordinarie causes: but certainly
they are the shaking of
the Rod, and fore-runners
of a great iudgement, vnlesse
Repentance cutte off their
course. For look as one cloud
followeth another, till the
Sunne consume them: so one
iudgement hastens after an other,
and repentance onely is
the Sunne, which must dispell
them.
               3. Thirdly, it stands with
the iustice of God, according

as he hath reuealed it in the
Scripture, especially in
Deut. 28. out of the whole
Chapter, it must needes bee
gathered as a Rule. I will curse
that people that breake my lawes:
nowe wee may not deny but
this land of ours, is for abundance
of sinne, a people of Sodome.
All kinde of sinnes, in all
estates of men, rage & raigne
euery day more and more:
therefore I conclude, that
vnlesse we repent, and so dissolue
this cloud of iudgemēt,
that hangs ouer our heades:
it cannot be, but a most fearefull
tempest is to come at the
last, and when it is come, it
will be too late to wish they
had done it. Therefore in
the bowels of CHRIST
IESVS. Let this bee to

intreate and exhort you all, to
search and looke into your
selues, that so repenting and
changing your wayes, you
may get the sword againe into
his sheath, which is alreadie
drawne out, but yet hath
not stricken home, and may
quench the wrath which is
alreadie kindled, but yet
burnes not out as it will doe,
if by repentance we quench
it not: and doe this euery
one, as you tender the saluation
of your owne soules, and
the continuance of the Gospell
to this glorious Nation,
and the peace and prosperous
state of this Church and common
wealth. For let mē make
what causes they will, it is certainely
sinfulnesse that ouerturnes
kingdomes, and changeth
states, as all these kingdomes

and states haue felt,
who haue continued finally to
contemne the Gospell.
            
            
               It followeth:
               
                  And you be as chaffe, that
passeth on a day.
               
               The Prophet proceedeth,
and describeth more plainly,
the manner and state of that
plague, which God will sende
vpon them: the meaning was
partly opened before, to bee
in effect thus much; Search
your selues, least God take
his fanne and try you, because
you woulde not trye
your selues, and finding you
vppon the tryall, not sound
Wheate, but light Chaffe:
blowe you to Hell with the
winde of his wrath: the Metaphor
which the Prophet vseth
is this, he compares the

Lord to a husbandman, great
and rich, the whole world is
his corne fielde: seuerall Nations,
(as this of ours for
one) are his heapes of corne:
but the heapes of corne bee
full of Chaffe, that is, these
particular Churches, are full
of hypocrites: nowe a wise
husbandman letteth Corne
and Chaffe lye together no
longer, then till the wind doth
blowe, and then he appoints
his fanning time to seuer his
corne from his chaffe, and to
blow away his chaffe, and lay
vp his corne: so God, the
great and wise husbandman,
will not let the chaffe lye for
euer amongst the Wheat, he
hath therefore appointed his
fāning times, whē to blow the
chaff into hel, & to gather his

wheat into heauenly garners.
               Nowe Gods winnowing
times are two, the one is at the
last day, after this life, and that
is Gods great winnowing
day of all his corne (that of all
men) when the bad shall be seuered
frō the good for euer,
neuer to be mingled againe
with them, but by the strong
& powerfull fan of his last and
finall iudgement to be blown
into hell: the winde of whose
wrath, at that day, shal be strō
                  ger
to blow them all away,
then all the wind in the world
to blowe away one handfull
of light Chaffe.
               2. Gods other fanning
time, is in this world, and that
is also double. The one is,
when the word is preached:
the Preaching of the word is

one of Gods fannes: For when
the Gospell is preached to a
Nation or Congregation, it
Fannes them, and tries them,
and purgeth them, and so
serues them, that a man may
see a manifest difference of
the chaffe and the wheat, that
is, of the goodly man, and the
wicked man: this preaching
of the Gospell doth Iohn the
Baptist expresly call a Fanne:
where the holy Ghost pursueth
this whole Metaphor
most plainely, speaking of
Christ, he saith, Whose Fanne is
in his hand, and he will throughly
purge his Floore, and gather
his wheate into his garner, but
the Chaffe hee will burne with
fire vnquenchable. The winde
of this Fanne of the word
preached, is so strong, as

that it seuers the Chaffe
from the Wheate, that is,
good professors from hypocrites
in the visible Church,
and blowes so strongly vpon
the wicked, that it brings
them to the beginning of
Hell euen in this world, for
it so worketh vpon the conscience,
as if it cannot conuert
them, it strikes them
with feare, terrour and torment,
either in life or at death,
which torment of conscience
is the very flashes of hellfire.
               But, when this first Fanne
of the word, will not serue to
bring men to repentance,
(for the word preached, doth
not confound a man actually,
but onely pronounce the
sentence, and thereby striue

strike the consciēce) then God
hath another fanne, and that
is the Fanne of his iudgements:
and that fanning or winnowing
time is, when he executes
his vengeance and his iudgements
on a Nation: this is
his latter fanne, when the
first will not preuaile, this is
his powerfull and strong fan
driuen about with the winde
of his wrath, this fanne went
ouer the olde worlde, and
swept them all away, and went
ouer the Nation of the Iewes,
and wee see they are no
more.
               1. These three fannes of
God, make a threefold separation
of the Chaffe from
the wheate, that is, of the wicked
from the Elect: with the
fanne of his worde which

is powerfull, hee seuers them
in all affection, and disposition,
and makes a distinction
of them, so, as generally the
wheat is knowne to be wheat,
and Chaffe discerned to bee
Chaffe, by the Preaching of
the word: but though the tare
be knowne to be tare, yet
both grow together, so that
the word onely serues them
in affection, and sets seuerall
notes of distinction vpon
them both.
               2. But then the second fan
of his iudgements is more violent,
for thereby he seuereth
them asunder in soule, gathering
the godly men, as his
Wheate into the heauens,
and blowing the soules of the
wicked into hell: but yet
the bodies of them both

lye together, as partakers of
the same iudgement, so subiect
to the same corruption,
and are all lodged in the same
graue of the earth, and death
hath like dominion ouer
them all.
               3. But afterwards at the last
day, at Gods great haruest,
and great winnowing time,
he then with the winde of his
power, seuereth them asunder
in soule and body. Wheat
from the chaffe, Sheepe from
the Goates, and separateth
them, neuer to be mingled againe
for euer and euer: and
then with the winde of his
wrath, hee blowes the chaffe
into fire vnquenchable, and
with his louing fauour gathereth
his wheate into the euerlasting
and glorious garners
of heauen.
               
                  
So then, the first seuereth
them in affectiō. The second,
in soule, for a time. The third,
actually in soule and body, for
euer and euer.
               Nowe of these three winnowing
times, the holy
Ghost speaketh here properly
of the second: namely, the
fanne of Gods iudgements: so
that, the meaning of the Metaphor
is this: Search your
selues and repent betimes, lest
God come vppon you with
some fearefull Iudgements: because
you haue so long contemned
the fanne of the word,
and finding you too light to
abide the triall, doe take you
away in the iudgement, and
cast you into hell: for as sure
as the fanne of the word hath
made differēce of you, which

are chaffe, and which are
wheate, so sure shall the fanne
of his iudgements, blow away
the chaffe to hell and damnation.
               Thus much for the meaning.
            
            
               Now for the vse, for vs in
England, the case stands thus:
Our Church doubtlesse is
Gods corne field, and wee
are the corne heape of God:
and those Brownists and Sectaries
are blinde and besotted,
who cannot see that the
Church of England is a godly
heape of Gods corne: but
withall, we must confesse, we
are full of chaffe: that is, of
prophane and wicked hypocrites,
whose hearts and
mindes abound in sinnes and

rebellions: and many of our
best professours are also too
full of chaffe (that is) of corruptions,
and do giue themselues
too much libertie in
many sinnes: but alas, the
pure wheate, how thinne is
it scattered? how hard to find
a man (at least a family) which
dedicate themselues to the
Lord in holy and sincere obedience,
and labour to make
conscience of all sinnes: now
therefore, seeing wee are
Gods corne field, and wee
haue some pure wheate amongst
much chaffe, therefore
God will winnow vs to
find out the corne, if he haue
but one corne of wheate in a
handfull of chaffe, but one
good man of many, hee will
stirre all the heape for those

few corners, hee will not care
to blow all the chaffe to hell,
to finde out those fewe cornes
of Wheate, to lay them vp in
heauen: so that out of all question,
England being so full of
chaffe, must looke to be winnowed.
               Now for the first Fanne of
his word, it hath beene vsed
in this land these fiue and thirtie
yeares, and that as powerfully,
and as plentifully as any
where in the world, and
yet (alas) many are more
godlesse, more ignorant,
more prophane then euer
they were, yea, wickednesse
groweth, and the chaffe increaseth
aboue the wheate: be
sure therefore, that God will
bring his second fanne vpon
vs; because we will not suffer

the first, and milde and gentle
fan of his word to try and search
vs: therefore wee will bring
the fearefull fanne of his iudgements,
and with it, hee will
blowe soule and body into
hell, with those our sinnes and
corruptions, which we would
not suffer the fanne of Gods
word to blow from vs. The
first hath so long blowne in
vaine, that the second must
needes come vnto vs, and it
hath already begun to blow:
three or foure blastes haue
blowne ouer vs; famine, pestilence,
earth-quakes, fire,
water, winde, these haue so
blowne some of vs, that they
haue taken away a great number
of vs For vs that remaine,In the plague at Londō ther dyed some weeke almost. 2000. a weeke in 92. But in 1603. there died 3300. in a weeke.
this onely remaines, that wee
strengthen our selues by

grace, to bee able to stand against
the next blast, for
come it will, and when it
comes no wealth nor worldly
thing can inable vs to endure
it, onely faith and repentance,
and the grace of God
will stand at that day. Now
therefore, in that so fearefull a
fanning abideth vs: seeing it
is so neere (as appeareth by
the blastes already past ouer
vs, which are nothing but the
forerunners of a greater tempest)
what should be our care
(except wee care not to be
blowne body and soule into
hell) but to labour to eschew
this fearefull fanne of Gods
wrath: or at least, if it come
vpon vs, that it may not blow
vs to hell, but hasten vs to
heauen. If thy heart be touched

to aske how this may
be. I answer thee, only to follow
the Prophets aduice in
this place, by searching and trying
our selues. The way to escape
Gods triall, is to try thy
selfe: & to escape Gods iugdement,
to be a iudge to thine
owne soule: and so the way to
escape the fearefull fanne of
God, is to fanne their owne
heart by the law of God. For
whomsoeuer the first fanne
(that is, the worde of God)
doth worke vpon: these men
are neuer blowne away with
the fan of Gods iudgements.
O then, entertaine the word
of God into thy heart, submit
thy soule vnto it, let it pierce
and try, & ransacke thy heart,
and lay before thee thy wretched
estate by thy sinnes,

and when thou seest thy nakednesse
and misery, confesse
it, bewaile it, and be humbled
for it, cry and call for mercy
and forgiuenes, pray against
thy speciall sinnes, striue to
purge them out, as the poyson
of thy soule, craue grace
from God for all thy sinnes:
if thou seest any sinnes more
welcome to thy nature, more
deere vnto thee, and which
more preuaile against thee,
then others doe, pray against
these sinnes, and striue against
them aboue all: & endeaour,
that by the fanne of Gods
word, they may be blowne away
from thee. When thou
hast done this, marke what
will come of it: when thou
hast fanned thy selfe, GOD
will not fanne thee: but when

the fanne of his iudgement
comes & bloweth so strongly
vpon the wicked, then the
Lorde finding thee alreadie
fanned, and clensed by his
word, will spare thee, and his
iudgement shall either blow
ouer thee, and passe by thee
vntouched (as ouer Lot, in the
destruction of Sodome) or else
shall fanne out all thy corruptions,
and blowe thee vp to
heauen, to be laide vp as pure
wheate in the heauenly garners,
and mansions of glorie,
which Christ ascribed to prepare
for thee.
               Now then amongst those
many businesses, with which
this world doth cumber euerie
of vs (all which shall perish
with the world it selfe)
let vs good brethren, spare

sometime for this great businesse.
Martha may be combred
about many things, but
this is that one thing, which is
necessarie: therefore whatsoeuer
is done, let not this be
vndone. Once a day put thy
selfe and thy life vnder the
fanne of Gods lawe, try thy
selfe what thou art, and thy
life, how thou liuest. Once a
day keepe a court in thy conscience,
call thy thoughts, thy
wordes, and thy deedes to
their triall: let the ten commaundements
passe vppon
them, and thy sinnes and corruptions
which thou findest
to be chaffe, blow them away
by repentance, so shalt
thou remain pure and cleane
wheate, fit for the house and
Church of GOD in this

world, and for his kingdome
in heauen. But, if wee will
not doe this, then alas, what
will follow? my heart greeueth
to vtter it: but I must,
vnlesse I should bee a false
Prophet: and therefore I will.
Our long peace, plenty, and
ease, haue bred great sinnes, so
great, that they reach to heauen,
and prouoke Gods Maiestie
to his face, & so strong,
that they will violently draw
downe iudgemēts from God
vpon vs: which when they
come, they will bee so
powerfull, and so violent,
that they will blowe vs away
like chaffe, and bring
this kingdome to some miserable
ruine. O therefore how
happy are wee, if we can entertaine

this doctrine, & practise
it: for in so doing, wee
shall preuent Gods iudgements,
we shall continue the
Gospell to this land, and preserue
this glorious Nation
from being destroyed or dispeopled,
by some fearefull
iudgement.
               Beloued,At Stirbridg Faire. you come hither
to this place, purposely to
buy and sell, and thereby to
better your estates in this
world: how happy then are
you, if besides the good markets
you make for your bodies
and estates, you learne
also how to make your selues
abide the triall of Gods iudgements,
and how to be made
pure corne, fit to replenish
the garners of heauen, and
howe to continue Gods fauour

and the Gospell to this
Nation. If thou goe away
with this lesson, thou hast a
Iewell more worth, then
thou shouldest goe home
possessed of all the huge riches
of this Faire: you call
this and such like times Faire
times: but if thou learne this
lesson right, then thou maiest
say, that this was the fairest
day in deede, that euer shone
vpon thee, since thou wast
borne. This pretious Iewell
which I haue spoken of al this
while, I here offer vnto thee.
Euery one bringes hither
something to be solde, this is
the marchandise that I bring
and set to sale vnto you: what
euer commoditie any of you
bring, it is from some quarter
of this land, but all is from

the earth: but this that I
bring, it is from heauen: and
all the earth cannot yeelde it:
and as it is from heauen, so it
is of a heauenly vertue, and
will worke that which all the
wealth in this Faire is not able
to doe: therefore cast not
to buy the basest, and let passe
the best of all: and neuer alledge
that it is aboue thy
compasse, and being a Iewell,
it is too deere and costly
for thee: for I offer it freely
vnto you, and to euery one of
you, I pronounce vnto you
from the Lord, that here this
blessed doctrine is offered
vnto you all, in his name,
freely, and that you may buy it
without money. Happy is that
day, when thou comming
so farre to buy things for thy

body, and payes so deare for
them, doest meete with so
precious a Iewell, the vertue
whereof, is to saue thy soule,
and payest nothing for it.
Thou mayest hereafter reioyce,
and say: I went to buy
and sell, and to helpe my body:
but I haue also learned to
saue my soule. I went thither
to helpe to mainiaine
my owne estate: but I haue
learned to helpe to maintaine
England in prosperitie: for assuredly,
if wee would all of vs
learne this lesson, and practise
it, wee might assure our
selues of the glorious prosperitie
of England, to continue
from generation to generation:
whereas alas, if wee
continue and goe forward in
our sinnes, and impenitencie,

it is greatly to be feared,
that neyther the Gospell, nor
this peace, will reach to our
posteritie. Therefore now to
make an end; I once againe,
and lastly, commend this doctrine
to you all, and euery
one of you (for this marchandise
that I bring, is of that
nature, that though some take
it, yet there is also inough for
euery one) and I commend
it vnto you, euen from the very
mouth of God himselfe:
thinke of it I charge thee, as euer
thou lookest to appeare
before the face of Christ Iesus
the great Iudge, at the last
day; and if thou wouldest escape
the rigour of that iudgement,
enter now into iudgement
with thy selfe, & search
thy selfe: if thou now wilt

not receiue this doctrine,
then shal it at the last day be
a bill of Enditement against
thee, for if it saue thee not, it
shal condemne thee: think of
it therfore seriously, as a matter
that concerns thy soule &
body: yea, and thy posterity,
and this whole Realme, all
which shall smart for it, if we
repent not. And if the body of
our people, and those, whose
hearts are wedded to this
world, will not entertaine this
doctrine; thē I turne vnto you
that feare the Lord, and to
you I direct my last warning;
Search, O search, and try your
hearts & liues, renew & reuiue
your faith & repentance, that
if iudgements doe come and
blow vpon this Nation, and
driue the Gospell from it, and

it to hell: that yet you may
haue a testimonie to your
consciences, that you did not
pull downe this generall calamitie,
but for your parts laboured
to haue preuented
it, by your earnest prayers
and hartie repentance: that
so, the posteritie ensuing,
may not curse you, but
speake reuerently of you, and
praise God for you, and wish
that all had done as you did;
for then had they enioyed
this goodly lande, and all
Gods blessings with it, as we
their forefathers did before
them: and so shall our names
not rotte, but flourish amongst
the posterities to
come, which shall be partakers
of the desolation: And
when we haue renewed our

repentance, let vs then euery
one of vs, deale with the Lord
by earnest prayer for this
Church and Nation, that the
Lord would shew his mercy
vpon it, and continue vnto
it, this peace and the Gospell:
it is nothing with the Lord
to doe it, his powerfull hand
is not shortened, he can continue
our peace: when the
Papists looke for hurli-burlies,
hee can continue the
Gospell, when they hope to
set vp their Idolatrie againe:
let vs therefore applye the
Lord with our prayers, and
with Moses set our selues in
the breach, and pray for the
ignorance of the multitude,
and bewaile their sinnes, who
bewaile not their owne. So
did Noah, Daniel, and Iob, in

their ages, and praied for the
people in generall calamities:
let vs all bee Noahs, Daniels,
and Iobs, in our generations:
if wee doe thus, then when
Iudgements come, we shall
either turne them away from
our Nation, or at the least
wee shall deliuer our owne
soules.
               Let vs now turne to the
Lord in prayer, and because
it cannot be hoped, but that
this our generall sinfulnesse
must needes ende with some
heauie Iudgement: let vs
desire the Lord still to defet
our deserued punishments,
and still to spare vs, and to
giue vs time and leysure to
repent: that so, wee entring
into our selues, and searching
our hearts, and turning

to the Lord: wee may turne
away his imminent Iudgements,
and that when his
wrath doth burne out indeede,
we may then be counted
worthy in Christ, to escape
those things which must
needs come vpon the world.
Amen.

                  Let vs Search and trye our
wayes, and turne againe to the
Lord.
