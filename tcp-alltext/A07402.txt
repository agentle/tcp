This knowledge of the Lawe bryngeth forth and engenderyth feare, and therfore feare is called a Relygious thynge. Foraſmoche therfore I do entende ſpedefully to ſpeake ef thoſe vertues, wherof the Philoſophers chifely do diſpute and whiche

we vſe towarde men, I muſte therfore begynne at the Quene of Iuſtice. vertues whoſe name is Iuſtyce, of whom truely Ariſtotile wryterh on this maner. Nother Heſperus nor Lucifier is more beautefull then Iuſtyce, for ſhe gouernyth al other vertues, and ſhe is the chefe bonde of Ciuille ſociety and generally ſhe ſignyfieth obedyence towarde all lawes, and conteyneth in her all vertue, and when holye cſripture ſpeaketh of Iuſtyce, obedyence towarde all lawes oughte to be vnderſtande. Secondely Iuſtyce ſignyfieth onely that vertue whiche in Iudgementes & cōtractes geuyth to euery mā his owne Thyrdly Iuſtyce in Paules diſputacions ſignyfieth imputacion of Iuſtice, or a diuine acceptaciō, as whan it is ſayde, it is imputed to hym for Iuſtyce. But of this ſignyficacion

the Philoſophers doo ſpeake nothynge, becauſe dyuers ſignyficacions conteyne dyuerſe kyndes, and that there be no more ſignyficacions thenne thoſe thre, there diuyſion therfore in the begynnynge is to be declared.

The poſityue lawe is the ſentence of the mageſtrate, that addeth to Poſytyue lawe the lawe of nature ſome circumſtaunce with a probable reaſon, as the law of nature doth teache theft to be punyſhed, thē the mageſtrate addeth a ſpice or a, kynde as who ſaith ye maner of payne in ordeynyng wherof he doth felow

            ¶ Whether it is a dedly ſynne to violate the lawes ciuill, that is the edictes of ciuill Mageſtrates.
            
               FYrſt of all therfore, it is a dedly ſynne to vyolate the Cyuyll lawes, or the edictꝭ of ciuill Mageſtrates / though it be without the caſe of ſlaūder, for Paule clearly ſayth it is neceſſarye to obey, not onelye for wrath but alſo for conſcience, that is we ought not to fere onely

the ciuill peyne but alſo we ought to knowe our conſcience to be gylty, yf we do not obey. Now it is ye parte of a good mynde to conſydre howe moche this kynde of obedyence and publice trāquiliteis, whiche To obey the lawes, god alſo doth require that we obey the lawes & Mageſtrates, & he ſayth yt he wilbe auēgeſer if we do not obey, & truely for the ſame, god doth puniſhe aſwel in this life as after this lyfe, as the fourth precept of peyns doth alſo ſpeake. &c.
