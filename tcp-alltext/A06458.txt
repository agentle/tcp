            The Prologue.
            GEntlemen, Inductions are out of date, and a Prologue in Verse is as stale, as a blacke Veluet Cloake, and a Bay Garland: Therefore you shall haue it plaine Prose thus: If there be any amongst you, that come to heare lasciuious Scenes, let them depart: for I doe pronounce this, to the vtter discomfort of all two peny Gallerie men, you shall haue no bawdrie in it: or if there bee any lurking amongst you in corners, with Table bookes, who haue some hope to find fit matter to feede his — mallice on, let them claspe them vp, and slinke away, or stay and be conuerted. For he that made this Play, meanes to please Auditors so, as hee may bee an Auditor himselfe hereafter, and not purchase them with the deare losse of his eares: I dare not call it Comedie, or Tragedie; 'tis perfectly neyther: A Play it is, which was meant to make you laugh, how it will please you, is not written in my part: For though you should like it to day, perhaps your selues know not how you should disgest it to morrow: Some things in it you may meete with, which are out of the common Roade: a Duke there is, and the Scene lyes in Italy, as those two

thinges lightly wee neuer misse. But you shall not find in it the ordinarie and ouer-worne trade of ieasting at Lordes and Courtiers, and Citizens, without taxation of any particular or new vice by them found out, but at the persons of them: such, he that made this, thinkes vile; and for his owne part vowes, That hee did neuer thinke, but that a Lord borne might bee a wise man, and a Courtier an honest man.

               Enter Duke of Millaine, Arrigo, Lucio, and two Courtiers.
               TIs now the sweetest time for sleepe, the night is scarce spent; Arrigo, what's a clocke?
               
                  Arr.
                  Past foure.
               
               
                  Duk.
                  Is it so much, and yet the morne not vp?
                  See yōder where the shamfac'd maidē comes
                  Into our sight, how gently doeth shee slide,
                  Hiding her chaste cheekes, like a modest Bride,
                  With a red vaile of blushes; as is shee,
                  Euen such all modest vertuous women be.
                  Why thinkes your Lordship I am vp so soone?
               
               
                  Lucio.
                  About some waightie State plot.
               
               
                  Duk.
                  And what thinkes your knighthood of it?
               
               
                  Arr.
                  I doe thinke, to cure some strange corruptions in the common wealth.
               
               
                  Duk.
                  Y'are well conceited of your selues, to thinke
                  I choose you out to beare me company
                  In such affaires and businesse of state:
                  But am not I a patterne for all Princes,
                  That breake my softe sleepe for my subiects good?
                  Am I not carefull? very prouident?
               
               
                  Luc.
                  Your grace is carefull.
               
               
                  Arri.
                  Very prouident.
               
               
                  Duk.
                  Nay knew you how my serious working plots,
                  Concerne the whole estates of all my subiects,
                  I and their liues; then Lucio thou wouldst sweare,
                  I were a louing Prince.
               
               
                  
                  Lucio.
                  I thinke your grace intendes to walke the publique streetes disguised, to see the streetes disorders.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  It is not so.
               
               
                  Arrig.
                  You secretly will crosse some other states, that doe conspire against you.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  Waightier farre:
                  You are my friendes, and you shall haue the cause;
                  I breake my sleepes thus soone to see a wench.
               
               
                  Lucio.
                  Y'are woundrous carefull for your subjects good.
               
               
                  Arrig.
                  You are a very louing Prince in deed.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  This care I take for them, when their dull eyes,
                  Are clos'd with heauie slumbers.
               
               
                  Arr.
                  Then you rise to see your wenches?
               
               
                  Lucio.
                  What Millaine beautie hath the power, to charme her Soueraignes eyes, and breake his sleepes?
               
               
                  Duke.
                  Sister to Count Vaelore: She's a maide
                  Would make a Prince, forget his throne and state,
                  And lowly kneele to her: the generall fate
                  Of all mortalitie, is hers to giue;
                  As she disposeth, so we die and liue.
               
               
                  Luc.
                  My Lord, the day grow's cleere, the Court will rise.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  We stay too long, is the the Vmbranoes head as wee commaunded, sent to the sadde Gondarino, our generall?
               
               
                  Arr.
                  Tis sent.
               
               
                  Duk.
                  But stay, where shines that light?
               
               
                  Arrig.
                  Tis in the chamber of Lazarello.
                  
               
               
                  Duke.
                  
                     Lazarello? what is he?
               
               
                  Arrig.
                  A Courtier my Lord, and one that I wonder your grace knowes not: for he hath followed your Court, and your last predecessors, from place to place, any time this seauen yeare, as faithfully as your Spits and your Dripping-pans haue done, and almost as greasely.
               
               
                  Duke
                  O we knowe him as we haue heard: he keepes a kallender of all the famous dishes of meate, that haue bin in the Court, euer since our great Graundfathers time; and when he can thrust in at no Table, hee makes his meate of that.
               
               
                  
                  Lucio
                  The very same my Lord.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  A Courtier cal'st thou him?
                  Beleeue me Lucio, there be many such
                  About our Court, respected, as they thinke,
                  Euen by our selfe; with thee I will be plaine:
                  We Princes do vse, to prefer many for nothing, and to take particular and free knowledge, almost in the nature of acquaintance of many; whome we do vse only for our pleasures, and do giue largely to numberes; more out of pollicy, to be thought liberall, and by that meanes to make the people striue to deserue our loue; then to reward any particular desert of theirs, to whome we giue: and doo suffer our selues to heere Flatterers, more for recreation
                  Then for loue of it, though we sildome hate it:
                  And yet we know all these, and when we please,
                  Can touch the wheele, and turne their names about.
               
               
                  Lu.
                  I wonder they that know their states so well, should fancie such base slaues.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  Thou wondrest Lucio,
                  
                  Do'st not thou thinke, if thou wert Duke of Millaine,
                  
                  Thou should'st be flattered?
               
               
                  Lucio
                  I knowe my Lord, I would not.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  Why so I thought till I was Duke, I thought I should haue left me no more Flatterers, then there are now plaine-dealers; and yet for all this my resolution, I am most palpably flattered: the poore man may loath couetousnes & flattery; but Fortune will alter the minde whē the winde turnes: there may be well a little conflict, but it will driue the byllowes before it.
                  
                     Arrigo it grow's late, for see faire Thetis hath vndon the bares
                  To Phebus teame; and his vnriual'd light,
                  Hath chas'd the mornings modest blush away:
                  Now must we to our loue, bright Paphian Queene;
                  Thou Cytherean goddsse, that delights
                  In stirring glaunces, and art still thy selfe,
                  More toying then thy teame of Sparrowes bee;
                  Thou laughing Errecina O inspire
                  
                     Her heart with loue, or lessen my desire.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               SCENA II.
               Enter Lazarello and his Boy.
               
                  Laz.
                  Goe runne, search, pry in euery nooke and Angle of the kitchins, larders, and pasteries, know what meate's boyl'd, bak'd, rost, stew'd, fri'de, or sows'd, at this dinner to be seru'd directly, or indirectly, to euery seuerall table in the Court, be gone.
               
               
                  Boy.
                  I runne, but not so fast, as your mouth will doe vpon the stroake of eleuen.

               
               Exit Boy.
               
                  Laz.
                  What an excellent thing did God bestow vpon man, when he did giue him a good stomacke? what vnbounded graces there are powr'd vpon them, that haue the continuall command of the very best of these blessings? Tis an excellent thing to bee a Prince, hee is seru'd with such admirable varietie of fare; such innumerable choise of delicates, his tables are full fraught with most nourishing foode, & his cupbords heauie laden with rich wines; his Court is still filled with most pleasing varieties: In the Summer, his pallace is ful of greene geese; and in Winter, it swarmeth woodcockes,

                        O thou Goddesse of plentie
                        Fill me this day with some rare delicates,
                        And I will euery yeare most constantly,
                        As this day celebrate a sumptuous feast,
                        If thou wilt send me victuals in thine honor;
                        And to it shall be bidden for thy sake,
                        Euen al the valiant stomacks in the Court:
                        All short-cloak'd Knights, & al crosse-garter'd gentlemē;
                        All pumpe and pantofle, foot-cloth riders;
                        With all the swarming generation
                        Of long stocks, short pain'd hose, & huge stuff'd dublets:
                        All these shal eate, and which is more then yet
                        Hath ere beene seene, they shall be satisfied.
                        I wonder my Ambassador returnes not!

                  Her yuorie limbes were chain'de, and straight before
                  A huge Sea monster, tumbling to the shoare,
                  To haue deuoured her, with more longing sight
                  Expect the comming of some hardy Knight,
                  That might haue quel'd his pride, and set her free,
                  Then I with longing sight haue look'd for thee.
               
               
                  Boy.
                  Your Perseus is come Master, that will destroy him,
                  The very comfort of whole presence shuts
                  The monster hunger from your yelping guts

                  Giue it mee. A Bill of all the seuerall seruices this day appointed for euery Table in the Court:
                  I, this is it on which my hopes relye;
                  Within this paper all my ioyes are clos'de:
                  Boy open it, and read it with reuerence.
               
               
                  Boy.
                  For the Captain of the Guards Table, three chynes of Beefe, and two jolls of Sturgeon.

                  Is't possible! can Heauen bee so propitious to the Duke?
               
               
                  Boy.
                  Yes, Ile assure you Sir, 'tis possible, Heauen is so propitious to him.
               
               
                  Laza.
                  Why then he is the richest Prince aliue:
                  He were the wealthiest Monarch in all Europe,
                  Had he no other Territories, Dominions, Prouinces, Seats,
                  Nor Pallaces, but only that Vmbranaes head.

                  If poore vnworthy I may come to eat Of this most sacred dish, I here do vow (If that blind huswife Fortune will bestow But meanes on me) to keepe a sumptuous house, A board groning vnder the heauie burden of the beastes that cheweth the cudde, and the Fowle that cutteth the ayre: I shall not like the table of a countrey Iustice, besprinckled ouer with all manner of cheape Sallets, sliced Beefe, Giblets, and Pettitoes, to fill vp roome, nor should there stand any great, combersome, vncut vp pyes at the nether end fill'd with mosse and stones, partly to make a shew with, and partly to keepe the lower messe from eating, nor shall my meat come in sneaking like the Cittie-seruice, one dish a quarter of an houre after one another gone, as if they had appointed to meet there, and had mistooke the houre, nor should it like the new Court seruice come in, in hast, as if it faine would be gone againe, all courses at once, like a hunting breakefast, but I would haue my seuerall courses, and my dishes well fil'd, my first course should bee brought in after the auntient manner, by a score of old bleere-ey'de Seruingmen, in long blewe coates, (marry they shall buy silke, facing, and buttons themselues) but that's by the way.

                  She is not bad that hath desire to ill,
                  But she that hath no power to rule that will:
                  For there you shalbe woed in other kinds

Exit Oria.
Now am I idle, I would I had bin a Scholler, that I might a studied now: the punishment of meaner men is, they haue too much to doe; our onely miserie is, that without company we know not what to doe; I must take some of the common courses of our Nobilitie; which is thu
                        •
                     : if I can find no company that likes mee, plucke off my Hatband, throw an old Cloake ouer my face, and as if I would not bee knowne, walke hastely through the streetes, till I be discouered; then there goes Counte such a one, sayes one; there goes Counte such a one, sayes another: Looke how fast he goes, sayes a third; there's some great matters in hand questionlesse, sayes a fourth; when all my businesse is to haue them say so: this hath beene vsed; or if I can find any companie, Ile after dinner to the Stage, to see a Play; where, when I first enter, you shall haue a murmure in the house, euery one that does not knowe, cries, what Noble man is that; all the Gallants on the Stage rise, vayle to me, kisse their hand, offer mee their places: then I picke out some one, whom I please to grace among the rest, take his seate, vse it, throw my cloake ouer my face, and laugh at him: the poore gentleman imagines himselfe most highly grac'd, thinkes all the

Auditors esteeme him one of my bosome friendes, and in right speciall regard with me. But here comes a Gentleman, that I hope will make me better sport, then eyther street and stage fooleries.
Enter Lazarello and Boy.
This man loues to eat good meate, alwayes prouided hee do not pay for it himselfe: he goes by the name of the Hungarie Courtier; marry, because I thinke that name will not sufficiently distinguish him, for no doubt hee hath more fellowes there, his name is Lazarello, he is none of these same ordinary eaters, that will deuour three breakfasts, & as many dinners, without any preiudice to their beauers, drinkings or suppers; but he hath a more courtly kind of hunger, and doth hunt more after nouelty, then plenty, Ile ouer-heare him.

                  Three seuerall Sallets haue I sacrifiz'de,
                  Bedew'd with precious oyle and vineger
                  Already to appease thy greedy wrath. Boy.

                  There is no way left for me to compasse this Fish head, but by being presently made knowne to the Duke.

                  That will be hard Sir.

                  When I haue tasted of this sacred dish,
                  Then shall my bones rest in my fathers tombe
                  In peace, then shall I dye most willingly,
                  And as a dish be seru'd to satisfie
                  Deaths hunger, and I will be buried thus:
                  My Beere shalbe a charger borne by foure,
                  The coffin where I lye, a powdring tubbe,
                  Bestrew'd with Lettice, and coole sallet hearbes,
                  My winding sheet of Tanseyes, the blacke guard
                  Shalbe my solemne mourners, and in stead
                  
                     Of ceremonies, wholesome buriall prayers:
                  A printed dirge in ryme, shall burie me
                  In stead of teares, let them poure Capon sauce
                  Vpon my hearse, and salt in stead of dust,
                  Manchets for stones, for other glorious shields
                  Giue me a Voyder, and aboue my hearse
                  For a Trutch sword, my naked knife stucke vp.

                  Y'are very welcome sir, I pray you stand vp, you shall dine with me.

                  I do beseech your Lordship by the loue I still haue borne to your honourable house.

                  Sir, what need all this? you shall dine with me, I pray rise.
               
               
                  Laza.
                  Perhaps your Lordship takes me for one of these same fellowes, that do as it were respect victuals.
               
               
                  Count.
                  O sir, by no meanes.
               
               
                  Laza.
                  Your Lordship ha's often promised, that whensoeuer I should affect greatnesse, your owne hand should helpe to raise me.
               
               
                  Count.
                  And so much still assure your selfe of.
               
               
                  Laza.
                  And though I must confesse, I haue euer shun'de popularitie by the example of others, yet I do now feele my selfe a little ambitious, your Lordship is great, and though young, yet a priuie Counseller.
               
               
                  Count.
                  I pray you sir leape into the matter, what would you haue me doe for you?
               
               
                  Laza.
                  I would entreat your Lordship to make mee knowne to the Duke.
               
               
                  Count.
                  When sir?
               
               
                  Laza.
                  Suddenly my Lord, I would haue you present me vnto him this morning.
               
               
                  Count.
                  It shall be done, but for what vertues, would you haue him take notice of you?
               
               
                  Laza.
                  Your Lordship shall know that presently. T'is pitty of this fellow, he is of good wit, & sufficient vnderstāding,

whē he is not trobled with this greedy worm.
               
               
                  Lazar.
                  Faith, you may intreat him to take notice of mee for any thing; for beeing an excellent Farrier, for playing well at Span-counter, or sticking kniues in walles, for being impudent, or for nothing; why may not I bee a Fauorite on the suddaine, I see nothing against it.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Not so sir, I know you haue not the face to bee a fauorite on the suddaine.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  Why thē you shall present me as a gētlemā wel qualified, or one extraordinary seen in diuers strāge misteries.
               
               
                  Count.
                  In what Sir? as howe?
               
               
                  Laz.
                  Marrie as thus—
               
               Enter Intelligencer.
               
                  Count.
                  Yonders my olde Spirit, that hath haunted mee daily, euer since I was a priuie Counsellor, I must be rid of him, I pray you stay there, I am a litle buisie, I wil speak with you presently.
               
               
                  Lazar.
                  You shall bring mee in, and after a little other talke, taking me by the hand, you shall vtter these wordes to the Duke: May it please your grace, to take note of a gentleman, well read, deepely learned, and throughly grounded in the hidden knowledge of all Sallets and pothearbs whatsoeuer.
               
               
                  Count.
                  'Twill be rare, if you will walke before Sir, I will ouertake you instantly.
               
               
                  Lazar.
                  Your Lordships euer.
               
               
                  Count.
                  This fellow is a kind of Informer, one that liues in Alehouses, and Tauerns, and because hee perceiues some worthy men in this land, with much labour & great expence, to haue discouered things dangerously hanging ouer the State; hee thinks to discouer as much out of the talke of drunkards in Taphouses: hee brings me informations, pick'd out of broken wordes, in mens common talke, which with his malitious misapplication, hee hopes will seeme dangerous, hee doeth besides bring mee the names of all the young Gentlemen in the Citie, that vse Ordinaries, or Tauerns, talking (to my thinking) only as the freedom of their youth teach thē, without any

further ends; for dangerous and seditious spirits, he is besides an arrant whore-master, as any is in Millaine, of a lay man. I will not meddle with the Clergie, he is parcell Lawier, & in my conscience much of their religion, I must put vpon him some peece of seruice; come hither Sir, what haue you to do with me?
               
               
                  Int.
                  Little my Lord, I onely come to knowe how your Lordship would employ me.
               
               
                  Cont.
                  Obserued you that gentleman, that parted from me but now.
               
               
                  Int.
                  I saw him now my Lord.
               
               
                  Cont.
                  I was sending for your, I haue talked with this mā, and I doe find him dangerous.
               
               
                  Int.
                  Is your Lordship in earnest?
               
               
                  Cont.

                  How vncertaine is the state of all mortall things? I haue these Crosses from my Cradle, from my very Cradle, in so much that I doe begin to growe desperate: Fortune I do despise thee, do thy worst; yet when I do better gather my selfe together, I do find it is rather the part of a wise man, to preuent the stormes of Fortune by stirring, then to suffer them by standing still, to power themselues vpon his naked body. I will about it.

maintainer and you shal haue your lodgings directly opposite, it is but putting on your night-gowne, and your slippers; madame, you vnderstand me?

                  That should attend a virgin, and quite voide
                  Of shame, hath left the house where shee was borne,
                  As they should neuer doe; let me endure

                  Not for the sinnes, but for the womans sake,

                  One that doeth seeme to loath all woman kind,
                  To hate himselfe, because he hath some part
                  Of woman in him; seemes not to endure
                  To see, or to bee seene of any woman,
                  Onely, because he knowes it is their nature
                  To wish to taste that which is most forbidden:
                  And with this show, he may the better compasse
                  (And with farre lesse suspition) his base endes.

                  He was the greatest seruant to that sexe,

                  The twynes of Adders, and of Scorpions
                  About my naked brest, will seeme to mee
                  More tickling then those claspes, which men adore;
                  The lustfull, dull, ill spirited embraces
                  Of women; the much praysed Amazones,
                  
                  Knowing their owne infirmities so well,
                  Made of themselues a people, and what men

                  Perceiuing that their follie made them fit
                  To liue no longer, that would willingly
                  Come in the worthlesse presence of a woman.
                  
                     I will attend, and see what my young Lord will doe with his sister.

                  To dissolue, nay gentle Lord, turne not away in scorne,

                  If to be red and white, a forehead hie,
                  An easie melting lip, a speaking eie,
                  And such a tongue, whose language takes the eare
                  Of strict religion, and men most austere:

                  And working to, yet to shew all these
                  Like dead motions mouing, vpon wyers,

                  We thanke you Gonderino, is it possible,
                  Can beleefe lay hold on such a miracle,
                  To see thee, one that hath cloystred vp all passion,
                  Turn'd wilfull votary, and forsworne, conuerse with women

in company and faire discoure, with the best beauty of Myllaine?
               
               
                  Gon.
                  Tis true, and if your Grace that hath the sway
                  Of the whole State, wil suffer this lewd sex,
                  These women, to pursew vs to our homes,
                  Not to be praid, nor to be rail'd away,
                  But they will woe, and daunce, and sing,
                  And in a manner, looser then they are
                  By nature (which should seeme impossible)
                  To throw their armes, on our vnwilling neckes.

                  Of this yong Maide, that yet hath knowne none ill?
                  Thinkst that damnation will fright those that wooe
                  From othes, and lies? but yet I thinke her chast,
                  And will from thee, before thou shalt apply
                  Stronger temptations, beare her hence with mee.

                  Not, if it be distasting to your Lordship, but giue mee freedome, & I dare maintaine, she ha's imbrac'd this body, and growne to it as close, as the hot youthfull vine to the elme.

                  Twice haue I seen her with thee twice my thoghts were prompted by mine eye, to hold thy strictnesse false and imposterous: is this your mewing vp, your strict retirement, your bitternesse and gaule against that sex: haue I not heard thee say, thou wouldst sooner meet the Basilisks dead doing eye, then meet a woman for an object: looke it be true you tell mee, or by our countries Saint your head goes off: if thou proue a whore, no womans face shal euer moue me more.

                  Hee that shall marry thee, had better spend the poore remainder of his dayes in a Dung-barge, for two pence a weeke, and find himselfe:

Downe againe Spleene, I preethee downe againe, shall I find fauour Ladie? shall at length my true vnfained penetence get pardon for my harsh vnseasoned follies? I am no more an Athiest, no, I doe acknowledge, that dread powrefull Deitie, and his all quickning heats, burne in my brest: oh be not as I was, hard, vnrelenting; but as I am, be partner of my Fires.

                  Sure we shall haue store of Larkes, the Skies will not hold vp long, I should haue looked as soone for frost in the dogge dayes, or an other Inundation, as hop'd this strange conuersion aboue myracle: let mee looke vpon your Lordship; is your name Gondarino, are you Millaines Generall, that great Bug-beare bloodie-bones, at whose very name all women, from the Ladie to the Landresse, shake like a cold fit.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Good patience helpe me, this Feuer will inrage my bloud againe: Maddam I am that man; I am euen hee, that once did owe vnreconciled hate to you, and all that beare the name of woman: I am the man, that wrong'd your honour to the Duke, I am hee that said you were vnchast, and prostetute; yet I am he, that dare deny all this.
               
               
                  Oria.
                  Your big Nobilitie is very merrie.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Lady tis true that I haue wrongd you thus,
                  And my Contrition is as true as that,
                  Yet haue I found a meanes to make all good againe,
                  I doe beseech your beautie, not for my selfe,
                  My merrits are yet in conception,
                  But for your honors safetie, and my zeale
                  Retyre a while, whilst I vnsay my selfe vnto the Duke,
                  And cast out that euill Spirit, I haue possest him with,
                  I haue a house conueniently priuate.
               
               
                  Ori.
                  Lord, thou hast wrong'd my innocence, but thy confession hath gain'd thee faith.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  By the true honest seruice, that I owe those eyes, strangely,
                  My meaning is as spotles as my faith.
               
               
                  Oria.
                  The Duke doubt mine honour? a may iudge
                  'Twill not be long, before ile be enlarg'd againe.
               
               
                  
                  Gond.
                  A day or two.
               
               
                  Orian.
                  Mine own seruants shall attend me.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Your Ladiships commaund is good.
               
               
                  Orian.
                  Looke you be true.

               
               Exit Oriana
               
                  Gond.
                  EIse let me lose the hopes my soule aspires to: I will be a scourge to all females in my life, and after my death, the name of Gondarino shall be terrible to the mighty women of the earth; they shall shake at my name, and at the sound of it, their knees shall knocke together; and they shall runne into Nunneries, for they and I are beyond all hope irreconcilable: for if I could endure an eare with a hole in't, or a pleated locke, or a bare-headed Coachman, that sits like a signe, where great Ladies are to bee sold within; agreement betwixt vs, were not to bee despaired of; if I could bee but brought to endure to see women, I would haue them come all once a weeke and kisse mee, where Witches doe the diuell in token of homage: I must not liue here, I wil to the Court, and there pursue my plot; when it hath tooke, women shall stand in awe, but of my looke.

               
               Exit.
            
            
               ACTVS III. SCEN. III.
               Enter two Intelligencers, discouering treason in the Courtiers words.
               
                  1. Intel.
                  
                  There take your standing, be close and vigilāt, here will I set my selfe, and let him looke to his language, a shal know the Duke ha's more eares in Court than two.
               
               
                  2. Int.
                  
                  Ile quote him to a tittle, let him speake wisely, and plainely, and as hidden as a can, or I shall crush him, a shall not scape charracters, though a speake Babel, I shall crush him: we haue a Fortune by this seruice hanging ouer vs, that within this yeare or two, I hope we shall be called to be examiners, weare politicke gownes garded with copper lace, making great faces full of feare and office, our labours may deserue this.
               
               
                  1.Int.
                  
                  I hope it shall: why ha's not many men bin raised from this worming trade, first to gaine good accesse to great men, then to haue commissions out for search, and

lastly, to be worthily nam'd at a great Arraignment: yes, & why not we? they that indeauour well deserue their Fee. Close, close, a comes: marke well, and all goes well.
               
               Enter Count, Lazarello, and his Boy.
               
                  Laz.
                  Farewell my hopes, my Anchor now is broken,
                  Farewell my quondam ioyes, of which no token
                  Is now remaining, such is the sad mischance,
                  Where Lady Fortune leades the slippry daunce.
                  Yet at the length, let me this fauour haue,
                  Giue me my wishes, or a wished graue.
               
               
                  Count.
                  The gods defend so braue and valiant mawe,
                  Should slip into the neuer satiate jawe
                  Of blacke Despaire; no, thou shalt liue and know
                  Thy full desires, hunger thy auntient foe,
                  Shall be subdued, those guts that daily tumble
                  Through ayre and appetite, shall cease to rumble:
                  And thou shalt now at length obtaine thy dish,
                  That noble part, the sweet head of a fish.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  Then am I greater then the Duke.
               
               
                  2. Int.
                  
                  There, there's a notable peece of treason, greater then the Duke, marke that.
               
               
                  Count.
                  But how, or where, or when this shall bee compas'd, is yet out of my reach.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  I am so truly miserable, that might I be now knockt ath' head, with all my heart I would forgiue a dog killer.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Yet doe I see through this confusednes some little comfort.
               
               
                  La.
                  The plot my Lord, as er'e you cam of a womā discouer.
               
               
                  1.Int.
                  
                  Plots, dangerous plots, I will deserue by this most liberally.
               
               
                  Count.
                  'Tis from my head againe.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  O that it would stand mee, that I might fight, or haue some venture for it, that I might be turn'd loose, to try my Fortune amongst the whole frie in a Colledge, or an Inne of Court, or scrāble with the prisoners in the dungeon; nay were it set downe in the owter court,
                  And all the Guard about it in a ring,
                  
                     With their kniues drawne, which were a dismall sight,
                  And after twentie leisurely were told,
                  I to be let loose, onely in my shirt,
                  To trie the valour, how much of the spoile,
                  I would recouer from the enemies mouthes:
                  I would accept the challenge.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Let it goe: hast not thou beene held
                  To haue some wit in the Court, and to make fine jests
                  Vpon country people in progresse time, and
                  Wilt thou loose this opinion, for the cold head of a Fish?
                  I say, let it goe: Ile helpe thee to as good a dish of meat.
               
               
                  Lazar.
                  God let me not liue, if I doe not wonder
                  Men should talke so prophanely:
                  But it is not in the power of loose wordes,
                  Of any vaine or misbeleeuing man,
                  To make me dare to wrong thy puritie,
                  Shew me but any Lady in the Court,
                  That hath so full an eie, so sweet a breath,
                  So softe and white a flesh: this doth not lie
                  In almond gloues, nor euer hath bin washt
                  In artificiall bathes; no traueller
                  That hath brought doctor home with him, hath dar'd
                  With all his waters, powders, Fucusses,
                  To make thy louely corpes sophisticate.
               
               
                  Count.
                  I haue it, tis now infus'd, be comforted.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  Can there be that little hope yet left in nature? shal I once more erect vp Trophies? shall I enioy the sight of my deere Saint, and blesse my pallate with the best of creatures, ah good my Lord, by whom I breath again, shal I receiue this beeing?
               
               
                  Count.
                  Sir, I haue found by certain calculation, and setled reuolution of the starres, the Fish is sent by the Lord Gondarino to his Mercer, now tis a growing hope to know where tis.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  O tis farre aboue the good of women, the Pathicke cannot yield more pleasing tittylation.
               
               
                  Count.
                  But how to compasse it, search, east about, and

bang your braines, Lazarello, thou art to dull and heauy to deserue a blessing.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  My Lord, I will not be idle; now Lazarello, thinke, thinke, thinke.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Yonders my Informer
                  And his fellow with table bookes, they nod at me
                  Vpon my life, they haue poore Lazarello that beats
                  His braines about no such waighty matter, in for
                  Treason before this—
               
               
                  Laz.
                  My Lord, what doe you thinke, if I should shaue my selfe, Put on midwiues apparell, come in with a hand-kercher, And beg a peece for a great bellied womā, or a sick child?
               
               
                  Count.
                  Good, very good.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  Or corrupt the waiting prentise to betray the reuersion.
               
               
                  1. Inte.
                  
                  Ther's another point in's plot, corrupt with money to betray: sure 'tis some Fort a meanes: marke, haue a care.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  And 'twere the bare vineger 'tis eaten with, it would in some sort satisfie nature: but might I once attaine the dish it selfe, though I cut out my meanes through swords and fire, through poison, through any thing that may make good my hopes.
               
               
                  2. Int.
                  
                  Thankes to the gods, and our officiousnes, the plots discouered, fire, steele, and poison, burne the Palace, kill the Duke, and poison his priuie Counsell.
               
               
                  Co.
                  To the mercers, let me see: how if before we can attain the means, to make vp our acquaintāce, the fish be eaten?
               
               
                  Laz.
                  If it be eaten, here a stāds, that is the most deiected, most vnfortunate, miserable, accursed, forsaken slaue, this Prouince yeeldes: I will not sure outliue it, no I will die brauely, and like a Roman; and after death, amidst the Elizian shades, Ile meete my loue againe.
               
               
                  1. In.
                  
                  I will die brauely, like a Roman: haue a care, mark that: when he hath done all, he will kill himselfe.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Will no thing ease your appetite but this?
               
               
                  Laz.
                  No could the sea throw vp his vastnesse,

And offer free his best inhabitants: 'twere not so much as a bare temptation to me.

                  Hunger, valour, Loue, ambition, are alike pleasing, and let our Philosophers say what they will, are one kind of heat, onely hunger is the safest, ambition is apt to fall; Loue and valour are not free from dangers, onely hunger, begotten of some olde limber Courtier, in pan'd hose, and nurs'd by an Attornies wife, now so thryuen, that he need not feare to be of the great Turkes guarde: is so free from al quarrells, and dangers, so ful of hopes, ioyes, and ticklings, that my life is not so deere to mee, as his acquaintance.

                  I will heare nothing; I will breake my knife, the ensigne of my former happie state, knocke out my teeth, haue them hung at a Barbers, and enter into Religion.

                  Doth he hope to cleare his sister, shee will come no more to my house, to laugh at me: I haue sent her to a habitation, where when she shal be seene, it wil set a glosse vpon her name; yet vpon my soule I haue bestowed her amongst the purest hearted creatures of her sexe, and the freest from dissimulation; for their deedes are all alike, only they dare speake, what the rest thinke: the women of this age, if there bee any degrees of comparison amongst their sexe, are worse then those of former times; for I haue read of women, of that trueth, spirit, and constancy, that were they now liuing, I should indure to see them: But I feare the writers of the time, belied them, for how familiar a thing is it with the Poets of our age, to extoll their whores, which they call mistresses, with heauenly praises? but I thanke their furies, and their craz'd braines, beyond beleefe: nay how many that would faine seeme serious, haue dedicated graue works to ladies tooth-lesse, hollow ei'd, their haire shedding, purple fac'd, their nayles apparantly comming off; and the bridges of their noses broken downe; and haue called thē the choyse handy workes of nature, the patterns of perfection, and the wondermēt of women. Our women begin to swarme like Bees in Summer: as I came hither, there was no payre of stayers, no entry, no lobbey, but was pestred with them: mee thinkes there might bee some course taken to destroy them.
               
               Enter Arrigo, and an old deafe countrey gentlewoman suter to the Duke.

                  I hope I shall liue to requite your kindnes.
               
               
                  Arrig.
                  You haue already.

               
               Exit Arrigo
               
                  Gentlew.
                  May it please your Lordship—
               
               
                  Gond.
                  No, No.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  To consider the estate—
               
               
                  Gond.
                  No.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  Of a poore oppressed Country Gentlewoman.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  No, it doth not please my Lordship.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  First and foremost, I haue had great injurie, then I haue beene brought vp to the Towne three times.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  A poxe on him, that brought thee to the Towne.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  I thanke your good Lordship heartily; though I cannot heare well, I knowe it grieues you; and heere wee haue beene delai'd, and sent downe againe, and fetched vp againe, and sent downe againe, to my great charge: And now at last they haue fetched mee vppe, and fiue of my daughters—
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Enough to damne fiue worldes.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  Handsome young women, though I say it, they are all without, if it please your Lordship, Ile call them in.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Fiue women! how many of my sences should I haue left me then? call in fiue Diuels first.
                  No, I will rather walke with thee alone,
                  And heare thy tedious tale of iniurie,
                  And giue thee answeres; whisper in thyne eare,
                  And make thee vnderstand; through thy French-hood:
                  And all this with tame patience.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  I see your Lordship does belieue, that they are without, and I perceiue you are much mou'd at our iniurie: her's a paper will tell you more.
               
               
                  
                  Gond.
                  A way.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  It may bee you had rather here mee tell it viua voce, as they say.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  O no, no, no, no, I haue heard it before.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  Then you haue heard of enough injurie, for a poore Gentlewoman to receiue.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Neuer, neuer, but that it troubles my conscience, to wish any good to those women; I could afford them to bee valiant, and able, that it might be no disgrace for a Souldier to beat them.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  I hope your Lordship will deliuer my petition to his grace, and yoo may tell him withall—
               
               
                  Gond.
                  What, I will deliuer any thing against my selfe, to be rid on thee.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  That yesterday, about three a clocke, in the after noone, I met my aduersarie.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Giue me thy paper, he can abide no long tales.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  'Tis very short my Lord, and I demaunding of him —
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Ile tell him that shal serue thy turne.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  How?
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Ile tell him that shall serue thy turne, be gone: man neuer doth remember how great his offences are, till hee doe meet with one of you, that plagues him for them: why should women only aboue all other creatures that were created for the benefit of mā, haue the vse of speech? or why should any deed of theirs, done by their fleshly appetites, be disgracefull to their owners? nay, why should not an act done by any beast I keepe, against my consent, disparage me as much as that of theirs?
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  Here's some few Angels for your Lordship.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Againe? yet more torments?
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  Indeed you shall haue them.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Keepe off.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  A small gratuit for your kindnesse.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Hold away.
               
               
                  Gent.
                  Why then I thank your Lordship, Ile gather thē vp

againe, and Ile bee sworne, it is the first money, that was refus'd, since I came to the court.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  What can she deuise to say more?
               
               
                  Gentlewo.
                  Truely I would haue willingly parted with them to your Lordship.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  I beleeue it, I beleeue it.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  But since it is thus—
               
               
                  Gond.
                  More yet.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  I will attend without, and expect an answere.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Doe, begone, and thou shalt expect, and haue any thing, thou shalt haue thy answere from him; and he were best to giue thee a good one at first, for thy deafe importunitie, will conquer him too, in the end.
               
               
                  Gent.
                  God blesse your Lordship, & all that fauour poore distressed country gentlewoman.
               
               Exit Gentlewoman.
               
                  Gond.
                  All the diseases of man, light vpon them that doe, and vpon me when I doe; a weeke of such daies, would either make me starke mad, or tame mee: yonder other woman that I haue sure enough, shall answer for thy sinnes: dare they incense me still, I will make them feare as much to be ignorant of mee and my moodes, as men are to bee ignorant of the lawe they liue vnder. Who's there? My blood grew cold, I began to feare my Suters returne; tis the Duke.
               
               Enter the Duke and the Count.
               
                  Count.
                  I know her chaste, though she be yong & free,
                  And is not of that forc'd behauiour
                  That many others are, and that this Lord,
                  Out of the boundlesse malice to the sexe,
                  Hath throwne this scandall on her.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Fortune, befriended mee against my will, with this good old country gentlewomā; I beseech your grace, to view fauourably the petition of a wrōged gentlewomā.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  What Gondarino, are you become a petitioner for your enemies?
               
               
                  Gond.
                  My Lord, they are no enemies of mine, I confesse the better to couer my deeds, which somtimes were loose

enough, I pretended it, as it is wisdome, to keepe close our incontinencie; but since you haue discouered me, I will no more put on that vizar, but will as freely open all my thoughts to you, as to my Confessor.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  What say you to this?
               
               
                  Count.
                  He that confesses, he did once dissemble,
                  Ile neuer trust his wordes, can you imagine
                  A maide, whose beauty could not suffer her
                  To liue thus long vntempted, by the noblest,
                  Richest, and cunningst masters in that Arte,
                  And yet hath euer held a faire repute;
                  Could in one morning, and by him be brought,
                  To forget all her vertue, and turne whore?
               
               
                  Gond.
                  I would I had some other talke in hand,
                  Then to accuse a sister to her brother;
                  Nor doe I meane it for a publike scandall,
                  Vnlesse by vrging me, you make it so.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  I will read this at better leisure: Gondarino, where is the Lady?
               
               
                  Count.
                  At his house.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  No, shee is departed thence.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Whither?
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Vrge it not thus, or let me be excus'd,
                  If what I speake betray her chastitie,
                  And both increase my sorrow, and your owne.
               
               
                  Count.
                  Feare me not so, if shee deserue the fame
                  Which shee hath gotten, I would haue it publisht,
                  Brand her my selfe, and whip her through the cittie:
                  I wish those of my blood that doe offend,
                  Should be more strictly punisht, then my foes.
                  Let it be prooued.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  
                     Gondarino, thou shalt proue it, or suffer worse then shee should doe.
               
               
                  Gond.
                  Then pardon me, if I betray the faults
                  Of one, I loue more deerely then my selfe,
                  Since opening hers, I shall betray myne owne:
                  But I will bring you, where shee now intends
                  
                     Not to be vertuous: pride and wantonnesse,
                  That are true friends indeed, though no in shew,
                  Haue entred on her heart, there shee doth bath,
                  And sleeke her haire, and practise cunning lookes,
                  To entertaine me with; and hath her thoughts
                  As full of lust, as euer you did thinke
                  Them full of modestie.
               
               
                  Duk.
                  
                     Gondarino, lead on, wee'l follow thee.

               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               ACTVS IIII. SCEN. II.
               Enter Pandar.
               
                  Pan.
                  Here hope I to meete my citizen, and here hopes he to meete his scholler; I am sure I am graue enough, to his eies, and knaue enough to deceiue him: I am beleeued to conjure, raise stormes, and diuels, by whose power I can doe wonders; let him beleeue so still, beleefe hurts no man: I haue an honest blacke cloake, for my knauerie, and a Generall pardon for his foolerie, from this present day, till the day of his Breaking. Ist not a miserie, and the greatest of our age, to see a handsome, young, faire enough, and well mounted wench, humble her selfe, in an old stammell petticoate, standing possest of no more fringe then the street can allow her: her vpper parts so poore and wanting, that yee may see her bones through her bodies: shooes she would haue, if her captaine were come ouer, and is content the while to deuote her selfe to antiēt slippers. These premisses wel cōsidered, gentlemē will mooue, they make me melt I promise yee, they stirre me much; and were't not for my smooth, soft, silken Citizen, I would quit this transitorie trade, get mee an euerlasting robe, feare vp my conscience, and turne Serieant. But here a comes, is mine as good as prize: Sir Pandarus be my speed, ye are most fitly met sir.
               
               Enter Mercer.
               
                  Mercer.
                  And you as wel encountred, what of this heire?

hath your bookes beene propitious?
               
               
                  Pan.
                  Sir, 'tis done, shees come, shee is in my house, make your selfe apt for Courtship, stroke vp your stockings, loose not an inch of your legges goodnesse; I am sure yee weare sockes.
               
               
                  Merc.
                  There your bookes faile ye Sir, in truth I weare no sockes.
               
               
                  Pand.
                  I would ye had Sir, it were the sweeter grace for your legges; get on your gloues, are they perfum'd?
               
               
                  Merc.
                  A pretty wash Ile assure you.
               
               
                  Pand.
                  'Twill serue: your offers must be full of bounty, veluets to furnish a gowne, silkes for petticoats and foreparts, shag for linings; forget not some pretty jewell to fasten, after some little complement: if shee deny this curtesie, double your bounties, be not wanting in aboundance, fulnesse of guiftes, linckt with a pleasing tongue, will winne an Anchorite. Sir, yee are my friende, and friende to all that professes good letters; I must not vse this office else, it fits not for a scholler, and a gentleman: those stockings are of Naples, they are silke?
               
               
                  Merc.

                  Mercer.
                  There is one thing intomb'd in that graue breast, that makes mee equally admire it with your schollership.
               
               
                  Pan.
                  Sir, but that in modestie I am bound not to affect mine own commendation, I would inquire it of you?
               
               
                  Merc.
                  Sure you are very honest, and yet yee haue a kind of modest feare to shew it: doe not deny it, that face of yours, is a worthy learned modest face.

venture, here you may surprise it.
               
               
                  Laza.
                  The miserie of man may fitly bee compared to a Didapper, who when shee is vnder water past our sight, and indeed can seeme no more to vs, rises againe, shakes but her selfe, and is the same she was; so is it stil with transsitorie man, this day: oh but an howre since, & I was mighty, mighty in knowledge, mighty in my hopes, mightie in blessed meanes, and was so truly happie, that I durst a said, liue Lazarello, and be satisfied: but now—
               
               
                  Boy.

                  But what Sir?
               
               
                  Laza.
                  Dust boy, but dust, and my soule vnsatisfied shall haunt the keepers of my blessed Saint, and I will appeare.

                  Boy.
                  If that be all, Sir ye may enter, for ye can know nothing here, that the Court is ignorant of, onely the more eyes shall looke vpon yee, for there they winck one at anothers faults.
               
               
                  Laza.
                  If I doe not,
               
               
                  Boy.
                  Then ye must beat fairely backe againe, fal to your physical messe of porridge, & the twice sackt carease of a Capon, Fortune may fauour you so much, to send the bread to it: but 'its a meere venture, and money may bee put out vpon it.
               
               
                  Laza.
                  I will goe in and liue; pretend some loue to the gentlewoman, screw my self in affectiō, & so be satisfied.

                  Boy.
                  Muffle your selfe in your cloake by any meanes, 'tis a receiued thing among gallants, to walke to their leacherie, as though they had the rhume, 'twas well you brought not your horse.

                  Why boy?
               
               
                  Boy.
                  Faith Sir tis the fashion of our gentry, to haue their horses wait at dore like men, while the beasts their maisters, are within at racke & mainger, 'twould haue discouered much.

                  Or if thou beest return'd to thy first being,
                  Thy mother Sea, there will I seeke thee forth,
                  Earth, Ayre, nor Fire,
                  Nor the blacke shades belowe, shall barre my sight,
                  So daring is my powerfull appetite.
               
               
                  Boy.
                  Sir, you may saue this long voyage, and take a shorter cut, you haue forgot your self, the fish head's here, your owne imaginations haue made you mad.

                  Laza.
                  The lookes of my sweet loue are faire, Fresh and feeding as the Ayre.
               
               
                  Boy.
                  Sir, you forget your selfe.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  Was neuer seene so rare a head, Of any Fish aliue or dead.

                  Good Sir remember, this is the house Sir.
               
               
                  
                  Laz.
                  Cursed be he that dare not venter.
               
               
                  Boy.
                  Pitty your selfe sir, and leaue this furie.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  For such a prize, and so I enter.

               Enter Madona Iulia, a whore.
               
                  Iulia.
                  What newes my sweet rogue, my deere sinnes broker, what? good newes?
               
               
                  Pan.
                  There is a kinde of ignorant thing, much like a Courtier, now gone in.

                  Pan.
                  A shines not very gloriously, nor does a weare one skinne perfum'd to keepe the tother sweet; his coate is not in or, nor does the world run yet on wheeles with him; is rich enough, and has a small thing followes him, like to a boate tied to a tall ships taile: giue him entertainment, be light and flashing like a Meteor, hug him about the necke, giue him a kisse, and lisping crie, good Sir; and is thine owne, as fast as a were tied to thine armes, by Indentures.

                  There is a gentlewoman sent hither by a Lord, shee's a peece of dainty stuffe my rogue, smooth, and soft, as new Satten; shee was neuer gumb'd yet boy, nor fretted.

                  Shee lies aboue, towards the street, not to be spoke with, but by the Lord that sent her, or some from him, we haue in charge from his seruants.

                  Be gone, I shall doe reason with him.

                  Are you the speciall beauty of this house?

                  Sir, you haue giuen it a more speciall regard by your good language, then these blacke brows can merit.

                  Prooue it againe Sir, it may bee your sence was set too high, & so ouer wrought it selfe.

                  'Tis still the same: how farre may ye hold the time to be spent Lady?

                  'Tis not so good vpon am emptie stomacke: if it might be without the trouble of your house, I would eate?

                  Sir, we can haue a Capon ready.

                  Me thinks your house should not be so vnfurnisht, as not to haue some pretty modicum?

                  Laz.
                  Sure I haue offended highly and much, and my inflictions make it manifest, I will retire henceforth, and keep my chamber, liue priuatly, and die forgotten.

                  Sir I must craue your pardō, I had forgot my selfe; I haue a dish of meat within, & it is fish, I think this Dukedome holds not a daintier: 'tis an Vmbranoes head.

                  Sir, though you haue carried it a great while priuatly, and (as you thinke) well; yet we haue seene your Sir, and we doe know thee Lazarello, for a traitor.

                  I haue enquir'd, but they of the house will suffer no letter nor message to bee carried from you, but such as the Lord Gondarino shall bee acquainted with: Truly Madam, I suspect the house to be no better then it should be.

                  Stay, good my Lord, I do beleeue all this, as great men as I haue had knowne whores to their sisters, & haue laught at it, I would faine heare how she talkes, since shee grew thus light: will your grace make him shew himselfe to her, as if hee were now come to satisfie her longing? whilest we vnseene of her, ouer-heare her wantonnes, let's make our best of it now we shall haue good mirth.

                  What is the confession of the lye you made to the Duke, which I scarce beleeue yet you had impudence ynough to do? did not gaine you so much faith with me, as that I was willing to be at your Lo. bestowing, till you had recouered my credit, and confest your selfe a lyar, as you pretended to do? I confesse I began to feare you, and desir'd to be out of your house, but your owne followers forc'd me hither.

                  Lucio.
                  That he would bee greater then the Duke, that he had cast plots for this, and meant to corrupt some to betray him, that he would burne the Cittie, kill the Duke, and poyson the priuie Councell; and lastly kill himselfe. Though thou deseru'st iustly to bee hanged, with silence yet I allow thee to speake, be short.
               
               
                  Laza.
                  My Lord, so many my greatest wish succeed,
                  So may I liue, and compasse what I seeke,
                  As I had neuer treason in my thoughts,
                  Nor euer did conspire the ouerthrow
                  Of any creatures, but of brutish beasts,
                  Fowles, Fishes, and such other humaine food
                  As is prouided for the good of man,
                  If stealing Custards, Tarts, and Florentines
                  By some late Statute be created treason;
                  How many fellow Courtiers can I bring,
                  Whose long attendance, and experience,
                  Hath made them deeper in the plot then I.
               
               
                  Luci.
                  Peace, such hath euer beene the clemencie of my gratious maister the Duke, in all his proceedings, that I had thought, and thought I had thought rightly; that mallice would long ere this, haue hid her selfe in her den, and haue turn'd her owne sting against her owne heart: but I well now perceiue; that so forward is the disposition of a depraued nature; that it doth not onely seeke reuenge, where it hath receiued iniuries; but many times thirst after their destruction, where it hath met with benefits.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  But my good Lord—

                  Luci.
                  Peace againe, but many times thirst after distruction, where it hath met with benefits; there I left: Such, & no better are the busines, that we haue now in hand.

                  But surely me thinkes, setting aside the touch of Conscience, and all other inward convulsions.

                  Your Lordship may consider—
               
               
                  Luci.
                  Hold thy peace: thou canst not answere this speech: no Tratour can answere it: but because you cannot answere this speech; I take it you haue confessed the Treason.
               
               
                  1. In.
                  
                  The Count Valore was the first that discouered him, and can witnes it, but hee left the matter to your Lordships graue consideration.
               
               
                  Luci.

                  Now Lazarillo thou are tumbl'd downe

                  All plagues that can be, Famine, and the sword
                  Will light vpon thee, blacke dispaire will boyle
                  In thy dispairing brest, no comfort by,
                  Thy Friends farre off, thy enimies are nie.
               
               
                  Luci.
                  Away with him, Ile follow you, looke you pynion him, and take his money from hurt, least he swallow a shilling and kill himselfe.

                  Both for her wronged honour, and your ill?

                  Dare ye be yet so wilfull, ignorant,
                  Of your owne nakednes, did not your seruants
                  In mine owne hearing confesse
                  They brought her to that house, we found her in;
                  Almost by force: and with a great distrust
                  Of some ensuing hazard.

                  He that hath begun so worthily,
                  It fits not with his resolution
                  To leaue of thus: my Lorde I know these are but idle proues.
                  What sayes your Lordship to them?

                  Let her sit neer her shame, it better fits her: call backe the bloud that made our streame in neerenesse, and turne the Currant to a better vse, 'tis too much mudded, I doe greeue to know it.

                  Dar'st thou make vp againe, dar'st to turne face, knowing wee know thee, hast thou not beene discouered openly: did not our eares heare her denie thy courtings? did we not see her blush with modest anger, to be so ouertaken by a tricke; can ye denie this Lord?

                  You should haue had a hotter volley from her
                  More full of bloud and fire, readie to leape the window, where she stood.
                  So truly sensuall is her appetite,

                  That is to marry a whore.
               
               
                  Laz.
                  When that is done, then will we taste the gift,
                  Which Fates haue sent, my fortunes vp to lift.
               
               
                  Boy.
                  When that is done, you'l begin to repent, vpon a full stomacke; but I see, 'tis but a forme in destiny, not to be alter'd.

                  Sir, what may be the currant of your busines, that thus you single out your time and place?
               
               
                  Arrigo.
                  Madame, the businesse nowe impos'd vpon me, concernes you neerely; I wish some worser man might finish it.

                  Why sir? I feele my selfe in perfect health.

                  Why good Arrigo?

                  Why, ye must die.

                  I know I must, but yet my fate calls not vpon me.

                  It does; this hand the Duke commandes shall giue you death.

                  Lady, your praiers may doe your soule some good,

                  Orian.
                  What's my offence? what haue these yeares committed,
                  That may be dangerous to the Duke or State?
                  Haue I conspir'd by poyson? haue I giu'n vp
                  My honour to some loose vnsetl'd blood
                  That may giue action to my plots?

                  With too much griefe condemne ye: though to me,
                  The fault deserues not to be paid with death.

                  To see the world, ha's not a soule more pure, more white,

                  honour, to haue sau'd then kil'd: but I haue done: strike,

                  I would not strike.

                  I will: Lady, there is that means yet to escape your death, if you can wisely apprehend it.

                  Then no; nay looke not ruggedly vpon me,
                  I am made vp too strong, to feare such lookes.

Cannons there, and discharge them against my brest rather: nay first, let this shee furie sit still where shee do's, and with her nimble fingers stroake my haire, play with my fingers endes, or anything, vntill my panting heart haue broken my brest.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  You must abide her censure.

                  Nay now thou art come, I know it is the Diuels Iubile, hell is broke loose:
                  My Lord, If euer I haue done you seruice,
                  Or haue deseru'd a fauour of your Grace,
                  Let me be turn'd vpon some present Action,
                  Where I may sooner die, then languish thus;
                  Your Grace hath her petition, grant it her, and ease mee now at last.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  No Sir, you must endure.
               
               
                  Gentlew.
                  For my petition; I hope your Lordship hath remembred me.

                  Whether doe you draw me Sir? I know it is not my Lords pleasure I should be thus vsed, before my busines be dispatched?

                  Tis that I would haue sworne, and doe: when I meddle with them, for their good, or their badde; may Time call back this day againe, and when I come in their companies, may I catch the poxe, by their breath, and haue no other pleasure for it.
               
               
                  Duke.
                  Ye are too mercifull.
