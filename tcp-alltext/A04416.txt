            With a short discourse of the late Earle of Essex his confession, and penitence, before and at the time of his death.

            To the Reader.
            
               ALthough Thucidides had neuer spoken it,Lib. 1. yet experience shewes it to be true, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that hearing is not liable to any accompt, but 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                whatsoeuer a mā speaketh, it laies open to other mens censure both his person, and his relation; which is eyther good or bad saith Nazianz. not by desert and truth,Apologer. but Secundum praeiudicium allatum, or affectionem innatam sayth Seneca, as the preiudice of his auditors is,Senec. Epist. which they

bring with them, or the disposition of their natures bred within thē: Neither of these hetherunto haue I eyther feared or fled, but, as I neuer made sute to preach any where, so beeing eyther commaunded, or requested, I neuer refused the most publike assemblies, as beeing diffident of that doctrines veritie which should passe from me, or guiltie of any calumniation which might, iustly, touch me. Custome makes some speake ill, but wisdome teacheth euen Philosophers to dispise it, and religion willeth Christians to forgiue it. The rule of Seneca is an oracle for truth, a comfort to a guiltlesse minde, Vt quisque est contemptissimus,
               
                  Quòd in Sap: non cadit iniuria.
                
               ita solutissimae linguae est, the basest sorted, and the lewdest of life, haue the most lauish tongues. Yet, I confesse,

that the addressing my selfe to this sermon (containing in it matter rather of state then diuinitie, and beeing like vnto the preamble of the Pharisees in my text, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , subiect to offence one way, eyther to them of authoritie if I should renounce this dutie, or the auditorie if I should speake of vncertaintie) was, as the Apostle speaketh,1. Cor. 2. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                with much feare and trembling: and therefore, as it is well knowne, from the time of this purpose for the Crosse, but three dayes in all, till the Saboth for the Sermon, I was not one day from the Court, still labouring to informe my selfe of euery thing which I doubted, that I might in these calumnious times, keep my selfe, for any thing I would there deliuer; from the

controlment either of ill tongues, or mine owne conscience: to which purpose I both framed a short preface personall, before I entered the discourse, which might essuier and rubbe out all opinion fore stalled; and abstayned from all bitternesse agaynst the person and action of the late Earle, least thereby I should exasperate mindes not resolued; and compared euery speach of his, vttered by me, both with his confession to the Lords, whose witnesse therein I humbly request, appealing thereunto; and with that conference he had with vs, let my associates be iudges, which might satisfie any but euen indifferently affected. Notwithstanding all this my care and paines, the malignitie of the meany is such, that, as if I

had either with Ananias lied vnto the holy Ghost, and had preached mine owne damnation, as it pleased some to blaspheme, it was giuen out that I was stroken, if not with madnesse, yet with a dreadfull sicknesse; or, as if I had spoken treason, that I was, the next day, committed close prisoner to the Tower; or at least, I had highly offended her maiestie, and receiued a great check from the Councell. The two first my body can answere, which hath beene, I thanke God, euer sithence, In latitudine sanitatis et libertatis, both in health, and at libertie: the two last cannot be throughly confuted by me, without some opinion of vanity and selfe glory, vnlesse that be checking,Eurip

                honourable words

aboue my desertes. Other, with more virulence, though with lesse violence for penall charge, frame matter of hard iudgement out of the discourse it selfe; first generall, that I haue broken the Canon both of religion and law, in reuealing a penitents confession, which was with remorse, and priuate. The cases wherein a Confessor may publish what he heares, are too many for this short preface, the learned and iudicious knowe them, to the peeueshly affected, it is but lost labour to name them. First, his confession was not auricular, but in the audience of three or foure. Secondly the crimes he confessed were notorious by his conuiction, and vnder his hand by subscription. Thirdly they were repeated and diuulged not

               ad scandalum, nec animo damnificandi, as the scholemen speake, to scandalize or annoy him, but to satisfie them who desired resolution, and to glorifie God whose spirite had wrought this conuersion; and, as Doctor Montford knowes, it was promised by me, in both our names, that we would, as occasion serued, giue publike and open testimonie of that his penitence and detestation of his offence. Secondly, in particular, because in one parte of my preface I said, I was not a penny the richer, nor a steppe the higher for him, albeit I celebrated his glory at the crosse, for Caliz victory: therefore hence they conclude that I now spake of the spleane, and preach for rewardes. Malice marres logike and charitie both: this inference hath no coherence

with my wordes, if eyther the precedentes were obserued, which I made in answere to a slanderous obloquy, That I was a time seruer; or the consequents, That I neuer moued him to preferre me, nor yet left to loue him, and honour him one iot the lesse for it. But this makes that speach of Seneca true, Nec deerunt qui te,
               Senec. de benef. 
               etiam per ornamenta, ferient, there are some so full of rancour who will turne a mans glory into his shame, & reproue him for things he should be commended: did I at that time labour for the place? yea rather as M. Doctor Stanhop knowes, I vsed all the meanes I could to auoide it, alleaging both the shortnesse of the time, but three dayes full; my late beeing in that place, scarce two monethes before: my youth and

vnexperience in those state matters; and such other delayes, till as he knoweth, it was inioyned by a commaundement peremptory: did I, after it, presse the court, solicite the Earle, affect any aduancement by him? God knowes that I lye not, he neuer saw me, till, halfe yeere after his returne from Caliz, he sent for me, about a matter of difference, in some pointes of religion,
                  Wright.
                betweene a Popish priest & my selfe, to take knowledge of me: at which time he promised me honourably, and, I thinke, if I had vsed his meanes, his promise had beene payment. Now then my argument holdes thus, if I neglected to obserue so great a personage, so fauoured, so able to preferre me, so willing by promise to do it, I was no time seruer nor preacher

for rewardes, And thus agayne it may be enforced, if I was beleeued & by the auditory applauded for my celebration of that victory, the circumstances and substance whereof I could deliuer but onely vpon report and intelligence: much more in this case am I to be credited and approued, hauing so certaine grounds for my relation. But from what spirit these obiections proceede, may soone be gessedat; which, a disposition, eyther at the crosse or in this epistle, bitterly eloquent, knowing what I know, would liuely describe to be that of Babell in the prophet, stand apart come not neare me, for I am holier then thou:Esa. 65.5. but as in my sermon, so here I renounce all tart & soure speach: but it makes me remember that excellent sentence of

               Philo,
               
                  De vita Mos. lib. 3.
                
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that the vulgar sorte will growe reproachfully madde agaynst him, who pleaseth not them in their madnesse.
            I little expected, yea not suspected, as the Lord knoweth, and many can witnesse, that I should be sent vnto him, but beeing sent, and hearing his confession so ape
                  •
               t and voluntary, and withall knowing the ouer-harried passions of some murmurers, it was my dutie in conscience to reueale it and satisfie all, as my selfe was fully satisfied; whose affection, that setled perswasion I had of his allegiaunce, through that his great semblance of religion, had I not hard & scene what I did, had before ouerswayed frō inclination to any contrarie suspition of him.

An other obiection is, that I, promising to speake nothing vpon reporte, vrged that conference betweene the Deane of Norwich and him: first, the rule in law is, condentis est interpretari, a man is fittest to expound himselfe. By that word nothing, I ment nothing concerning this crime of his, and his confession: secondly, I reade it out of the paper, making it knowne it was but a reporte: thirdly, I vrged nothing of it, but that which agreed with like wordes which he had spoken in my hearing, els where. The other base and grosse vntruthes, that I rayled vpon the Earle; & of my selfe, accused mine owne naturall countrimen the citizens, to be a base people, as some haue giuen out, I referre for their answere vnto the tenor of my sermon,

which here I haue printed, and presented vnto thee, Reader, as neare as I could gesse, and as some of good place which hard it, and since that read it, thinke, euery worde as I spake it; vpon my credite nothing but one is altered to my knowledge, that concerned him, which then I vttered, onely one or two things added which then I forgot. If thou haue in thee the affection of a christian, & a good subiect, read and be satisfied, it is that which was intended, and I indeauoured: but if thou haue Magus his disease,Acts. 8. the gall of bitternesse excrea, disgorge thy spite, know that I esteeme not thy slaunders, nor regarde thy reproaches, and dissemble it neuer so cunningly, I am not the principall thou aymest at, but according to the

prouerbe Faber cadit cum ferias fullonem, it is the state thou greeuest at, not my sermon. And least I seeme to speake this at random, let that be obserued which is giuen out for a truth, & my denial thereof wil scarce be credited: how the late Earle at the time of his execution song eyther the 54. or the 94 Psalme, for vpon the number they cannot agree, there being no such thing mentioned at all: marke the tenor of those Psalmes and then iudge of the reporters spirites, and what they intend I conclude with Samuell & Paul:

A preiudice you must needes haue against mee, if it be true, which some ill affected, and foule mouthed haue giuen out, that because we, being commanded by authority, on the Saboth after the insurrection, in our seuerall cures, did describe the nature and vglinesse of the rebellion, are becom time seruers & men pleasers, leauing the great man that is dead, and now cleauing to others, and closing with them for preferments. A sore imputation as may be layd vppon the ministers of Christ, and followed with an heauier iudgement

from God then they are aware of who thus speake. For a curse is laide vpon vs in the prophesie of Ieremie, if in the Lordes worke, in such holie places and exercises as these, wee auoyde not all negligence, and Saint Gregorie addes fraudulenter: fraudulently he dealeth, who either giueth titles, as Iob speaketh, or becomes a seruant to men, which S. Paule abhorreth▪ Now, he is said to giue titles, that either praiseth him that is not to bee praised, or imputeth faultes to men which they haue not committed, or doth rengrege or amoinder, that is, make greater or lesse the faults committed: and if I do thus, saith Iob, My maker will confound me, Iob, 32. a dreadfull iudgement: and so for the other,

generals, the right honourable the Lord Admirall, and the late Earle, the victorie at Caliz: at which time, and long since, he soared in his highest pitch of fauour with her Maiestie, and yet from that day to this, though it were giuen out that he wold

            My reuerence to their Lordshipe I acknowledge, and will performe what is due, and I am able: but flatterie of great personages, and popularitie with the multitude I euer abhorred as a Parasiticall Simony, & leaue it to them who haue no desert to raise them, but aurum cum aura a smooth tongue, and a bribing purse.

euery dastardly Hare wil be treading vpon him whose locke they feared while he liued. Yea Salomon notes it as a point of Atheisme to preferre a liuing Dogge before a dead Lion: wherfore Dauid tooke another course, and though Abner had béene his enemie liuing, yet béeing slaine, he both lamented his death, & celebrated his praise. Know ye not (saith he) that a Prince, and a great man is fallen this day in Israell?
               2. Sam. 3.38. 2. Sam 3.38. but, beloued, there is a difference in faultes of men, as in diseases some hurtful onely to the parties themselues, some loathsome and infectious to others: the first are to be buried with their bodies, and forgotten, but the other will annoy, & therefore must be remembred after death. In scripture some kings, who were vicious, had their faultes touched euen after their buriall, but no more: yet some are neuer named in scripture, but their sinne is branded vpon their name, as often you may sée of Ieroboam, neuer mentioned, but

presently is added, the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to sinne: and would to God the same earth which couereth the late Earle his body, could also couer the sinne and offence he died for, which himselfe confessed to be a leprousie which had infected farre and neare. Now you know, that though a Lepor auoide the house or die, yet he leaueth behind him both the house, and ayre daungerously contagious: and I pray God though he be deade, that the remainder and contagion of his offence, cause vs not, too often, to call his fault to memorie. But in my conscience I am perswaded, that there is none so inhumane or barbarous, that recordes it as triumphing and insulting at it: but with a double commiseration both of his fall, and of his soule, as then it was. First (giue him his due) who grieues not that a man so noble by birth, so honourable in office, so gratious with his prince, so witty by nature, so learned by conference and study, so religious in profession, so valiant

in warre, so beloued of the commons, so followed and honoured by men of all sortes, should not vse those great fauours of God and his soueraigne to gods glory and his countries good? for could he in any moderation haue carried himselfe, and haue béene contented with his great state, what good might he haue done to this church and realme, to men of state, of religion, of learning, of war? but as fire, if it be well and rightly vsed, burneth in the house to the good and profit of the familie: but if mislayed or abused, burneth the house to the vndoing of the inhabitantes: so had he béene contented to haue béene

I tolde him it was pride, but his word was vanitie and lewd counsell.
            
            Secondly who doth not commiserate his soule, as then it was? though now I am perswaded his repentance was so harty, that it is in heauen: that, being guilty to himselfe in his conscience (which now appeares by his voluntary confession to vs, and written) of so great an off

vttered vnto my Lordes Grace of Canterburie in Lambeth house, the night of his apprehension. Oh, my Lord, saith the Archbishop, I am sorie to sée this day, that you haue so farre forgot your selfe: the Earle replyed smilingly, that the sinceritie of my conscience, and the goodnesse of my cause dooth comfort me: this spéech argues he thought himselfe not guiltie of offending God. As if a good intention, we will suppose it so, dooth make the action good. The Canon Lawyers say, that God loues Aduerbes better then Adiectiues, he cares not how good quâm bonum, but quam benè, how well, and by what good meanes it is done which we intend. The iustifying of an ill execution vpon a good purpose and meaning, is the vtter subuersion of all religion and policie: an opinion forged at the fire of hell, and hammered at the Anuile of the Popes faculties. The same Deane asking him why he refused to come to the Lords, being

sent for by the appointment of her Maiestie, he answered that, by Scripture, and thus reasoneth, Dauid refuseth to come to Saul when he sent for him: Ergo I might lawfully refuse to come to Queene Elizabeth.

It séemes the contagion is spred. To which the Deane replying, that extraordinary attempts must haue extraordinary warrants, and willed him to shew his authority, his answer was, that He was Earle Marshall of England and needed no other warrant. Yet that was not so, because he was sequestred from it long before. But his conclusion peremptory what should I (saith he) reason with you vpon this point, seeing we holde not one principle, which was, that hee might remooue euils from the land, for that was it which from the beginning to the end he held, as by complaint to vs of some things to be reformed, he insinuated.

his araignement: I wounder your Lordshippe thus guiltie to your selfe, could be so confident at the barre, it offended many of your very good friends: yea, but now saith the late Earle, I am become another man, the cause thereof he ascribed to the worke of Gods spirite within him; and the meanes to his chaplain Maister Ashton who was there present with vs, for he, as he said to the honourable the Lord Kéeper and the rest, hath plowed vp my hart, as he said to vs, hath brought me down and humbled me.

For some thrée or foure dayes before his execution he made meanes by maister Warbarton one of her Maisties gentlemen Pencioners, to haue some conference with

three or foure of the Lordes of her Maiesties Counsell, wishing also if it pleased her Maiestie, that maister Secretary Cecill might be sent with them: wherevpon the Lord Keeper, Lord Treasurer, & the Lord Admiral, taking Maister Secretary with them, came vnto him, to whome he clearely laide open the whole proiect and purpose, penitently cōfessed it, expressed his harty sorrow for his confidence at his araignment, asked forgiuenes of the Lord Keeper, &, by him, of the rest whom he caused in his house to be imprisoned: particulerly and vehemently in christian charitie desired Maister Secretary to forgiue him that great iniury which at the Barre in his passion, by vniust calumniatiō, he had cast vpon him, and of them also he requested forgiuenes whom he had challenged for his enimies, & had charged with such great, but false imputation. (All which, in grosse and general, he confessed to vs, forgiuing and asking forgiuenes) & so after an entire reconciliation

The second was, that he might haue libertie to set downe in writing what in worde he had confessed to them, and other things which either at the barre he had denied, or should then occure to his memory. The confession it selfe filles foure shéetes of paper, euery worde in his owne hand, and his name at the end, which my selfe haue séene, and will shew vnto you so much as is fit: the preface thereof I haue transcribed for your sakes, and this it is, Since that God of his mercie hath opened mine eyes, and made me see my sinne, my offence, and so touched my hart as I hate it both in my selfe and others, I will as God shall inable my memorie, set downe how far

we all are guiltie, and where, and by what degrees our sinne, this offence grew. The cheife, and the briefe is this, his purpose of surprising the court with a power; the places allotted to foure persons, S. Christopher Blunt the gate with a company; S.

count that safety for a Prince to be a prisoner to her subiects. God forbid we should haue felt the Issue of this, nay God be thanked saith he to vs, that it was preuented. And withall gaue God like thankes that he had made him this example to be iustly spewed out of the land. Which word Spewed he inforced with a violence, arguing himselfe therby to be, vnto this Realme, as a furfet vnto the stomack, both a burthen and a danger. He saw himselfe a burthen in this charge of souldiers, béeing a burthen to the Cittie and countrie, which but for him had now béen spared: he felt himselfe a burthen, as it séemed, to vs by longing and desiring, which oft he did, that the time of execution were come.

            IN one onely thing Doctor Montford differeth from me viz. where I report that the Earle said this plot was framing when be lay at my Lord Keepers. That worde when, Doctor Montford thinkes, should be not long after: I haue great inducements of circumstance and substance to holde my oppinion still: but, at his earnest intreatie, I haue altered it, and for thy sake, reader, no

            2. The said Doctor Montford presently after my Sermon, put me in minde of one thing, somewhat materiall, arguing what conceit the Earle had of his owne purpose and action. For we speaking of the constancie of Martyrs at their death; and of that place of Paul▪ Rom. 8.18. The

Earle, with passion, said that they dyed in a good cause, but he should dye in

                I doubted not but he should dye in Christ.
            3 Another thing I call to minde, noted by me, but forgotten in my Sermon, how the Earle speaking to vs of some his complices apprehended in this action, but NOW, saith he, I am in my soule perswaded they wil proue good subiects. Which word Now, referred to his death, confirmes those wordes of his cited in my Sermon that his life was no safety to the Queene. Himselfe being taken

            The true copy, in substance, of the late Earle of Essex, his behauiour, speach, and prayer, at the time of his execution.
            
               ON Wednesday the xxv. of Februarie An. Domini. 1600. called Ashwednesday, about eight of the clocke in the morning, was the sentence of death executed vpon Robert Deuoreux Earle of Essex, within the Tower of London, where a scaffold beeing set vp in the court, and a forme neare vnto the place, whereon sat the Earles of Cumberland, and Hertforde, the Lord vicecount Bindon, the Lord Thomas

Haward, the Lord Darcie, and the Lord Compton: The Lieutennant with some sixteene partizans of the guarde was sent for the prisoner, who came in a gowne of wrought veluet, a black sattē sute, a felt hat black, a little ruffe about his necke, accompanied from his chamber with three Diuines, Doctor Montford, Doctor Barlow and Maister Ashton his Chapleine
                  •
                them he had requested, not to part from him, but obserue him, and recall him, if eyther his eye, countenance, or speach, should bewray any thing which might not beseeme him for that time: all the way he desired the spectators to pray for him, and so ariuing on the skaffold, he vayled his hat, and with obeysance vnto the Lords, to this effect he spake. viz.
            
            
               
               MY Lordes, and you my Christian Brethren, who are to be witnesses of this my iust punishment, I confesse to the glory of God, that I am a most wretched sinner, and that my sinnes are more in number then the hayres of my head, I confesse that I haue bestowed my youth in wantonnesse, lust, and vncleannesse, that I haue bene puffed vp with pride, vanitie, and loue of this worlds pleasures. And that notwithstanding diuerse good motions inspired into me from the spirit of God, The good which I would, I haue not done, and the euill which I would not, that haue I done. For all which I humblie beseech my Sauiour Christ to be a Mediatour to the eternall Maiestie for my pardon: especially for this my last sinne, this great, this bloudy, this crying, this infectious sinne, whereby so many

haue for loue to me beene drawne to offend God, to offend their Soueraigne to offend the world; I beseech God to forgiue it vs, and to forgiue it me most wretched of all; I beseech her Maiestie and the state and ministers thereof to forgiue it vs; and I beseech God to send her maiesty a prosperous raigne and a long, if it be his will: O Lord grant her a wise and vnderstanding heart: O Lorde blesse her and the Nobles, and the ministers of the church and state. And I beseech you and the worlde to hould a charitable opinion of me for my intention toward her Maiestie, whose death, I protest I neuer meant, nor violence to her person. I neuer was I thanke God Athist, not beleeuing the worde and scriptures, neither Papist trusting in my owne merites. But hope for saluation from God onely, by the mercy and

merites of my Sauiour Christ Iesus. This faith was I brought vp in, and herein I am now ready to die. Beseeching you all, to ioyne your soules with me in praier, that my soule may belifted vp by faith aboue all earthlie things in my praier, for now I will giue my selfe to my priuate praier: yet, for that I beseech you to ioyne with me, I will speake that you may heare me. And heere, as he turned himselfe aside to put of his gowne, Doctor Montford requested him to remember to pray to God to forgiue all his enemies if he had any. To whom he answered, I thanke you for it: and so turning himselfe againe to the Lords and the rest, he said, I desire all the world to forgiue me, euen as I do freely and from my hart forgiue all the world. Then putting off his Gowne and Ruffe,

and presenting himselfe before the blocke, kneeling downe, he was by Doctor Barlowe encouraged against the feare of death. To whom he answered, That hauing beene diuerse times in places of daunger; where death was neither so present, nor yet so certaine, he had felt the weakenesse of the flesh, and therefore now in this great conflict desired God to assist and strengthen him: and so with eyes fixed on Heauen, after some passionate pauses and breathings, he began his prayer in effect following.
            
               
                  
                     
                        
                           O GOD, Creator of all things, and iudge of all men, thou hast let me knowe by warrant out of thy worde, that Sathan is then most busie when our

end is neerest, and that Sathan being resisted will flee. I humbly beseech thee to assist me in this my last combat: and seeing thou acceptest euen of our desires as of our actes: accept I beseech thee, of my desires to resist him, as of true resistance, and perfect, by thy grace, what thou seest in my flesh to be fraile and weake, giue me patience to beare as becommeth me, this iust punishment inflicted vpon me by so Honorable a triall: Graunt me the inward comfort of thy spirit: let thy spirit scale vnto my soule an assurance of thy mercies, lift my soule aboue all earthly cogitations: and when my life and body shall part, send thy blessed Angels which may receiue my soule, and conuaye it to thy ioyes in heauen.
                     
                  
               
            
            Then concluding his prayer for all Estates of the Realme, he

shut vp all with the Lords prayer, reiterating this petition: Lord Iesus forgiue vs our trespasses, Lord Iesus receiue my soule: Then desiring to be informed what was fit for him to doe for disposing himselfe fitly for the blocke, the Executioner on his knees presented himselfe, asking him forgiuenesse: to whom the Earle said, I forgiue thee▪ thou art welcome vnto me, thou art the minister of iustice. At which time Doctor Montford requested him to rehearse the Creed, which he did, repeating euery article after the Diuines. So opening and putting off his doublet, he was in a Scarlet Wastecoate, and then ready to lye downe, he said he would onely stretch foorth his Armes, and spread them abroade, for then he was ready: So bowing towards

the blocke, the Doctors requested him to say the two first verses of the 51. Psalme, which he did: and then inclining his bodie he sayd. In humilitie and obedience to thy commaundement, in obedience to thy ordinance, to thy good pleasure, O God, I prostrate my selfe to my deserued punishment, Lord be mercifull to thy prostrate seruant: so lyeng flatte along on the bordes, and laying downe his head, and fitting it vpon the blocke, stretched out his armes, with these last wordes, which he was requested to say. Lord into thy hands I commend my spirite. His head was seuered from his bodie by the axe at three stroakes. But the first deadly, and absolutely depriuing all sence and motion.
