SERMON PREACHED
in the Cathedrall Church in Norwich,
the xxi. day of December,
1589. by W. Burton, Minister
of the word of
God there. And published for the satisfying
of some which took offence
thereat.
            
               
                  Iob. 27. 5. God forbid that I should iustifie them

            To the Reader.
            
               BEcause we are in all holy duety to giue
no offence, to lew, Grecian,
               1. Cor. 10. 23 
               nor to the
church of God, and this Sermon hath been
taken so vnkindly, as that the author therof
is for it accounted an enemy to Caesar, is
turned out of liuing, interdicted of his ministery
for a sabboth of yeeres, and by a publique
acte, disabled from all kinde of scholasticall
function throughout the whole
land: the deliberation of Iob seemed good
in this behalf. Oh that I had some to hear
me: but behold,Iob 31. 35. my signe that the almighty
will witnes for me, though my aduersary
shoulde write a booke against mee,

and binde it as a crovvne vnto me?

and goe vnto him as to a prince.

may haue the sweet milke of knowledge and

may feede his people therewithall, that not

protesteth (as in the sight of God) that it is
faithfully translated from the pulpit to the
pen, sauing that some pointes hee hath now
more enlarged then hee could then for want

done: and therefore leauing them to God
which would make the worlde beleeue that

            A SERMON.
            
               Ieremie 3. verse 14.
               O ye disobedient children, turne againe
saith the Lord: For I am your Lord.
            
            
               THESE words be part
of an exhortation be gun
in the 12 ve. of this chapter,
which was made to
the children of Israel, beeing captiues
in Assiria in the yeare of Hoshea king of
the ten tribes, as appeareth in the second
of the kings, the 17. chapter, the
6 verse. And it did grow vpon a complaint
against Iuda because that Iuda
did not profite by the iudgementes of
God vpon Israel: which being ended,
God here commādeth him to exhort
the 10. tribes in captiuitie to profite
better by those afflictions which wer
vppon them, & to returne to God by
true and timely repentance. Which if
they did, then God doth also promise
(for his part) to forget all their sinnes
past, and to place them in their former
estate againe. In this exhortation we
are to consider of two circumstances.

The first is of the persons: the second
is of the matter subiect. The persons
be twoo fold. First, exhorted: Secondly
exhorting. The persons exhorted
are the captiue Iewes, described
in the two first wordes: the first is, disobedient,
the second is, children. The
persons exhorting, are two fold. The
Lord by Ieremie: and Ieremie in the
name of the Lord, & that appereth in
these words: sayth the Lord. The matter
subiect, is two fold. First, what they
are exhorted vnto, in these wordes:
turne againe. Secondly, a reason why,
in these wordes: for I am your Lord.
            
            In the names giuen to the persōs
exhorted, appeare first, the wisedome
of God. Secondly his mercie. His wisedome
appereth in ripping vp of their
sins before hee exhorteth them to repē
               tance.
Hee saith not simply, O my children,
turne againe: least they shoulde
plead, not guiltie, & take an action of
the case against Ieremy for impeaching
their credit. But he saith, O ye disobedient
children, that so he might conuince

persons, with whom he hath to deale,
and according to the quality & quantitie
of the sinne against which he dealeth:
examples hereof wee haue not a
few in the scriptures.
            Christ will not breake the bruised
reede,Matt. 12. 20. nor quench the smoking flaxe,Psal. 2. 9.
but the rebelles wil he batter in pieces
like a potters vessel. Moses was the
mekest man vpon the earth,Num. 12. 3. yet none
more angrie with Aaron then he,Deur 32. 6. neyther
more seuere against Idolaters
then he. Paul will perswade Foelix to
become a christian,Actes. 2. 6 28. 29. and will conuey
himselfe into the bowels of the Galathians,
               Gal. 4. 19.
to winne them vnto Christ,Gal. 2. 11. 14. but
hee meaneth to take vp Peter for halting,Actes 13. 10.
and to pronounce Elimas the verie
child of the deuill.
            As this doctrine was alwaies profitable,
so neuer more needefull then in
these our times: whē there be quot homines
tot opiniones. Hovv many mē, so
many mindes. Some would haue the
preacher to speak alwaies alike, & that
of nothing but of mercy & saluatiō by

Christ, to speak placentia, & to prophecy
of new wine & strong drinke, but in
no case to avvaken them out of their
dead sleep of sinne and transgression.
Some would haue the preacher neuer
to alter his tune, but alwaies to be
thundring out the iudgemēts of God,
& to minister nothing but bitter purgations,
as though all men were sicke
at once, of one disease & of one cause.
Some again, can abide neither piping
nor mourning, but wil take exceptions
against the charmer, charme hee neuer
so wisely. If the minister reproue their
sinnes, they call hym a busie controller:
If hee shall apply the scripture
to his cōscience, then vvho made him
a iudge: If the preacher shal tel them
of Gods iudgementes, then hee speaketh,
as though he would fraie his audience:
If hee standeth neuer so little
aboue his houre, then he doth not edifie
but tedifie: If hee intreateth them
friendly and priuately, then they say
hee is glad to currie fauour, and they
will aske him for his commission: If

he be sparing in his speach, then he is
afraide to displease: If he speake learnedly,
then he is proude: If plainly, thē
he is no scholler: If often, then they are
glutted: But if he wil sooth them vp in
their sins with an omne bene, or a nihil
dicit, he is the best preacher that euer
they heard.
            Thirdly, the prophet telleth them
of their disobedience, that so he might
make them more fit to returne vnto
God: vvherein we learne this lesson,
that in all our reprehensions and admonitions,
we must seeke the good of
our brother, and the glorie of God:
and therefore sharpe sentences in the
scripture are verie profitable, not to
driue men from God, but from their
sinnes.Mat. 3. 
                     •
                  
                If Iohn Baptist call the scribes
and pharisees a generation of vipers, it
is not to make them desperate but
fruitfull in the vvorkes of repentance.
And truely beloued, then is the
                  •
                c
                  •
               hope
of doing good by sharpe censures,
when men may see that vvee doe not
censure them of malice, or to make

them odious, or to get our solues a
name, or for some other sinister respect,
but of conscience and of loue,
seeking thereby the good amendement
of our brother, and that vve are
no vvhit glad for their faultes, but rather
grieued at their falles. And if this
rule vvere obserued among those, to
vvhome the censures of the church be
committed, I doe not doubt but that
more good should be done, then now
is done. But when men shall perceiue
that all their citations, admonitions,
suspensions, excommunications, and
other censures whatsoeuer doe not
proceede from a hatred of sinne, nor
a conscience and care to amend their
brethren, but either of a stomack to reuenge
their ovvne quarrels, or else
from a couetous affection, to mayntaine
their ovvne gaines: alas, vvho
vvill greatly care for them? And vvhen
al men shal perceiue that they are no
vvhit grieued at the sinnes of men,
but the more presentmentes, the
more their gaines, and the gladder

to restore him again. And good reason:
for if vve be bound by the lavv of
God to help a beast vnder his burbē,
much more our brother. But alas this
is a meere stranger among vs. Homo
homin
                     •
                   non Deus, sed lupus. man is a
vvoolfe to man. If a mans foot hath
slipped neuer so little, especially, if he
be a good man (as vvho can say hys
heart is clean) prophane men are readie
to exclaime of him, but neuer labour
to reclaime him, and if a brother
be once dovvn in anie sinne, euery one
vvill be readie to throvve his verdit
and cast a stone at him, neuer remembring
vvhat our sauiour Christ saide
vvhen he vvrote vpon the ground,Iohn 8. 7. but
forgetting themselues to bee loaden
both vvith motes and beames, they do
as dogs doe, vvhich vvhen one poore
curre is in disgrace, all the rest runne
after him vvith open mouth and full
crie. Alas if God should thus hotly
pursue our sinnes as vve do persecute
our brethren,Psal. 130. 3. and if God should be so
inexorable as vve,Psal. 143. 2. alas I say vvhat

should become of vs?
            Fourthly, this gratious example of
our heauenly father, dealing so mer
                  •
               
cifully vvith his disobedient childrē
               condemneth
the vncharitable practises
of three sortes of men. First, of the
Papistes, Whose fingers are dyed of a
sanguine colour in the bloude of those
men, which haue but transgressed the
dyrtie decre
                  •
               s of an Italian Priest and
deuilish ordinances of hel itselfe: and
yet these Gnat-strainers and Camelsvvallowers
bevvaile the vvant of loue
among vs. Secondly, it meeteth vvith
an abuse in our Church-gouernours,
who vse (for the most parte) to make
excommunication 
                  •
               acken about the
country for fees, for trifles & matters
of no momēt, asthough that the greatest
censure of the Churche, and the
greatest iudgement next to the generall
iudgement may be plaied vvithall
and so farre abused as thereby to cut
off, and cast out members of the
Churche to the deuill at our pleasure.
What seruant vvill care for that maister,

vvhich vvill be fighting for euerie
trifle? And vvho vvill not abhorre that
chirurgion that for euery litle vvheale
or bone ache, vvill cut of a member, and
yet take money for his painfull paines?
Our good God doeth not caste off his
people, no, not for disobedience, but stil
admonisheth them, and taketh them
for his children, so long as there is any
hope of returning. Thirdly, of our Brownists,
who cast of the whole Church of
Englande for no apparant Church of
God, which is more then they ought to
doe for two causes: first, though disobedience
be (as it is in deede) as the sinne
of witchcraft, and who is not disobedient
in many things? yet so long as they
cannot chalenge vs for apostacie, as wee
may some of them, and so long as there
is any life at all in her, shee is not to be
layd out vpon the colde ground. But
soft a while: though she hath not all her
ornaments according to the worde of
God, yet she doeth not refuse them, if
she might lawfully come by them, but is
ready to receiue them when so euer they

shalbe offered vnto her. In the meane
time she mourneth for her wants, and
seeketh a redresse as she may,Ex
                     •
                  ch. 9. 4. and sueth
as she ought, and therefore no doubt is
marked on the forhead for the deare
spouse of Iesus Christ, so long as shee
doeth hold the foundation in him. But
let it be granted that the church of England
were proued as the church of
Rome, a very harlot, and were iudged
for her contumacie worthy to be put into
the black booke of excommunication
(which God forbid) yet for them to
be their owne caruers and bailiffes, is
more then they ought to doe, for they
be but priuate men: and this is certaine,1. Cor. 5. 4.
that no particular congregation, much
lesse a priuate person may excommunicate
a whole church.
            Lastly, in ioyning these two wordes
together, we learne to censure sinne in
all, but to iudge and hope charitably of
all, to spare sinne in none, so to condēne
none,Mat. 7. 1. for that is Gods office. And on
the other side, to hope the best, and to
loue thy brother, but so as we winke not

at sinne in any,Leuit. 19. 17. for that were indeede to
hate our brother. And this are we taught
here, while God calleth them disobedient,
yet still children: children, but yet
disobedient. Many thinke that we hate
them if we tell them of their sinnes, and
many take those mē for their best frēds,
which doe alwaies sooth them vp in
their sinnes, and neuer reprooue them:
but both these sorts of men are greatlie
deceiued. The first must know that the
reproofe of a friend is better then the
kisse of a flatterer.Pro. 27. 6. Yea,1. Sam. 16. 11. 12 if Shimei an enemie
shall rayle vpon Dau
                     •
                  d, though it
be Shimei his sinne, yet it may & ought
to be Dauids benefite. The second sort
must also vnderstand, that the sweetest
doctrine to the eare is not alwayes the
vvholsomest to the heart: but the bitter
pill is better to purge then the sweete
perfume. The winde is boysterous, but
it will make a man holde his garment
fast about him, when the gleaming Sun
wil make him put of al to his shirt. And
though the thunder be terrible to the
eare, and the lightning a dazzler of the

eye, and both an astonishment to the
heart, yet doe they more purifie th
                  •
               
ayre then the calmest day in summer.
And are the golden mouthed flatterers
alwaies the best frends? No, no beloued,
Latet anguis sub herba, the greenest
herbe doeth often couer the fowlest
toade, where the water is stillest, there is
it deepest, the fayrest garment doeth often
couer the fi
                  •
               thiest carkas, when the
baite is most in sight the hooke is least
suspected, the friendliest kisse in shewe,
is sometimes but treason in trueth. The
Bee hath her honie, so hath she a sting, &
the one vvil woūd more then the other
will heale. When Herodes Courtiers
crie,Act. 12. 21. 22. 
               O vox non hominis, sed dei. O the
voice not of a man but of a God, then
must Herod come downe vvith a mischiefe:
vvhen the foure hundred false
Prophets shall say to Achab,
               1. King. 22. 12. 28. goe and
prosper, then must Acha
                     •
                  
                looke least to
thriue, neither shall be return in peace.
And yet beholde, vnvvise men content
themselues vvith the names of Christians,
Protestants, and the children of

God, when disobedience to God hath
robbed them of the nature of Gods children.
Oh vnwise indeed, that care more
for the shels then for the kernell, which
set more by the badge on the sleue, then
by the wages in the purse, which take
more delight in the name then in the
nature of a true Christian man. Malunt
baberi quam esse. They had rather be
so accounted, then be so indeed: but beloued,
howsoeuer God in mercie calles
them children, yet is it not because they
are disobedient, but in hope of their amendment,
and as he calleth them children
that he might encourage them to
returne, so also doeth he call them disobedient
children, to put them in minde
wherin they degenerated from the nature
of children indeede. And so much
for the persons exhorted, in these words
O ye disobedient children.
            
            The persons exhorting are, God by
Ieremie, and the Prophet in the name
of the Lord. And this is of force to enforce
the exhortation: as if he shoulde
say, I doe not of my selfe thus reproue

you, for then you might thinke me too
busie, but the Lord set me a work, whose
will I must obey, and therfore you must
heare me with patience. Thus Ieremie
pleadeth his commission, partly for his
owne discharge, and partly to make his
message of more credite and force vnto
them. And thus might Ieremie reason:
He that is but a seruant, must do his masters
message: I am but a seruant, therefore
I must doe my masters message. Againe,
he that doeth but his masters message,
is not therfore to be blamed: I doe
that and no more, and therfore I am not
to be blamed. Againe, whatsoeuer the
Lord saith, that must be beleeued: but
the Lord saith you are disobedient, and
if you will obey him hee will bee your
Lord, therfore you must beleeue it. Againe,
whatsoeuer the Lord by his messengers
doth command, that must be obeyed:
but the Lord by me doeth commaund
you to turne againe, therfore see
that you doe obey as you wil answere at
your vttermost perill.
            Here we haue three things to consider

of. First, of the authoritie, Secondly,
of the dignitie. Thirdly, of the duetie of
Gods Ministers.
            Their authoritie is very great,Of their

                  A
                     •
                  
                  thority and
their commission is very large. For behold
(saith the Lord to Ieremie) I ha

                  e
set thee ouer Nations and kingdomes,
               Ier. 11. 10 
               to
plucke vp, and to roote out, to destroy and
throwe downe, to buylde aud to plant. But
how? Ezechiel sheweth how. Thou son
of man▪ feare not them,
               Ezec. 2. 
               nor their words, although
thou remaine among scorpions,
feare not their lookes, for they are a rebellious
house. vers. 7. Therefore thou shalt
speake my words vnto them. So that it
must be done without fear, and by speaking
the word of God without ceasing.
The Minister of God therfore hath authoritie
by the vvord to reprooue Princes,2. Chro. 36. 15.
as the proph
                  •
               t saith,Ie

                     •
                  . 2. but not by the
sword to remoue princes, as the Pope
saith: Hee hath authoritie in Christ his
steade to proclaime forgiuenes of sinnes
to the penitent beleuers,Ioh. 20. 23. as the Euangelist
saith, but not to absolue them whom
he list, as the pope saith: He hath authoritie

to reproue thinges amisse in the
Church or commonwealth by doctrine,
as the word saith, but not of himselfe to
reforme by practise, as the Brownist
saith. For d

               position of Princes belōgeth
to God onely:1. Sam. 15. 28. & 24. 6. 7. 8. 13 Luk. 5. 20. 21. forgeuenes of sinnes belongeth
to God onely: reformation of
Churches and Commonweales belongeth
to Princes onely: but the reproouing
of sinne in Prince, Church or commonwealth,
belongeth to Ministers also.
And this they 
                  •
               ay doe, this they
ought to doe, yet with vvisdome & discretion.
Nay, bloud for bloud if they
doe lesse then this, if they do more then
this, and if they doe not all this. Why
then should Moses bee murmured at?
why should Micbea be smitten? or why
should Ieremie be imprisoned for executing
their commission? Haue they not
authoritie to speake? Nay vve say to you
(if you be ang
                  •
               y with vs for this) as your
seruants vvill say for themselues: Wee
are but seruāts, it is nothing to vs, agree
with our master & vve shall be content.
We may speak what his vvord speketh,

for vve haue authoritie, and vvee must
speake so much, for therefore are vvee
put in authoritie. And so much brieflie
for the authoritie of Gods ministers.
            As their authoritie is great, so is their
calling excellent and honourable in respect
of their office,Of their dignitie. and of his person,
whose mouth they are. We can think as
basely of our selues, as any can either
thinke or speake of vs: but if it be an excellent
thing to be a kings Ambassador,
how much more then to bee Ambassadour
to the king of heauen and earth?
Therfore are they called in Scripture by
names of great accoūt,Ap

of the Lord Iesus. Some haue
tenne talents, some haue but one,Mat. 25. 15 yet all
must occupie for their Lordes aduauntage.
Some come at the first houre,Mat. 20. 2 some
at the last: yet all sent of God. Some are

like Iames and Iohn,
               Marke 3. 17 the sonnes of thunder,
some like Barnabas,

God. Some haue receiued a greater
measure of gifts,Ephe. 4. 7 some a lesse: yet all according
to the measure of the gifte of
Christ. And therefore let vs esteeme of
them as of the ministers of Christ, and
the disposers of the secrets of God. Men
they are as we are,1. Cor. 4. 1 that is our benefite,
for if God himselfe should send forth his
voice, vve must yeelde vp our liues. Sinfull
they are as we are, that is, because
they are men, born of the seed of Adam.
Mortall they are as we are, that is, because
they are sinfull, for the rewarde of
sinne is death: yet still the messengers of

this were regarded, then Gods ministers
should be more regarded, lesse despised,
more beleeued, lesse disgraced, better
prouided for, lesse pinched, and not so
villanously entreated, shamefully slandered,
and euery way abused of so many
as now they are. But alas, it is not greatly

regarded, no not at all of many, and

What is the cause? Any cause will serue
the turne in this point. Facile inuenies
baculum, quo canem cedas. When the
Pharisies could not abide the doctrine
of Christes disciples, they found quickly
a iust defence of their quarrel.Marke 2. 24. 
               They doe
that on the sabboth day which is not lavvfull.
And wot you what that was? They
plucke the eares of corne. Our Pharisies
also haue taken vp the same accusation
against vs. For (say they) we doe that on
the sabboth day which is not lawfull.
And first to begin vvithal, they crie out 
vpon him rebell, he wil not vveare the
surplice euery sunday & holy day, which
he must doe vvhether hee hath any or
no: And is not this a sufficient cause to
deny the minister of his maintenance?
Againe, they say we will not reade all

seruice at all times, and therfore (whether
the law dispense vvith him or no if
he preach) we haue found sufficiēt cause
to deny him his duetie. Again, they say
 vve vvil not read euery Collect, say gloria patri
at the end of euery Psalme, nor
make a leg at the name of Iesus: and is
not this a sufficient cause to denie him
 his duetie? Againe, they say we are angry
vvhen vvomen of their good deuotion
doe take vpon them the ministers
office, and reade prayers publiquely to a
congregation, and yet, say they, we haue
no reason for it: for vvil you haue a womanlie
in a vvhole moneth, and come
to church for so little as the Queenes
booke doeth allow her? And is not this
a sufficient cause to deny him his duety?
 Againe, they say vve vvil not bury the
dead, vvhich vve ought to doe if it bee
brought to the graue, vvhether vvee
knovv of it or no: And is not this cause
 sufficient. Againe, they say vve vvil not
visite the sick of the plague, & although
vve offer to doe it vvith consent of the
vvhole, and so as it may not be preiudiciall

to our publique ministerie: yet this
is cause sufficient to deny their duetie.
Againe they say, vve vvil not reade seruice 
euery day forenoone and afternoone,
to the vvalles and the vvindows,
to the stooles and the stones: and is not
this cause sufficient to denie vs our duetie?
Againe, they say vvee vvil not bid 
Imber dayes, according to their Almanacke,
a booke of great authoritie and
very autenticall, for it shewes vs this
yeare vvhat vve shal haue the next: and
is not this a sufficient cause? Item, they 
say vve sing psalmes in time of the communion,
vvhich vvere foysted in by the
Geneua puritans: and is not this cause
sufficient? Againe, they say vvee preach
against Papists, Atheists, Vsurers, Drunkards,
Swearers, Lords of misrule, abuse
of apparrel, gaming, & vvorking on the
sabboth day, and such like commēdable
and common exercises of good neighborhood:
& is not this a sufficient cause?
Item, they say vve preach so plainly, &
stand so long, that they fal either 
                  •
               o napping,
or els to prating vvhē vve begin, &

commonly they leaue vvhen vve ende:
and is not this a sufficient cause? Lastly,
 if they should pay the minister his duetie,
the loane of so much money vvere
lost, vvhich in many yeares vvoulde amount
to some round summe: and are
not all these, or any of these, sufficient
causes thinke you, to handle Gods pore
ministers and seruāts, as you haue heard
before? And if vvee say, Currat lex: let
the lavv be iudge, then say they we dāce
in a net. But I vvould aske of these our
heauie masters but two questions. First,
whether I vvere sufficiently discharged
or no, if I shoulde refuse to administer
the Lords supper, because some Church
papist in my parrish vvill neuer receiue
the communion.
            Secondly, what hath good Queen Elizabeth
done, that she can get nothing
of some of them. I hope it is not because
she hath banished idolatrie, & brought
in the gospel. Some cārob Peter to pay
Paul, but these men can cunningly rob
both Peter and Paul, and pay neither of
both, and all to saue stakes. O auri sacra

the true cause, for vve haue been all this
vvhile among the eares of corne, and
therfore the vvrit must be returned with
non est inuenta: but we wil haue another
ad melius inquirendum, to make a nevve

the magistrates are breakers of the Sabboth
day, if they suffer it to be broken,

any abuses or corruptions of the church
is auribus canem vellere, to pul a dog by

vs, for they crie, Let our pastors & preachers
haue no more libertie geuen thē,

let them gather their straw themselues:
that is, let them preach their belly full,
and keepe all our exercises (for they account
of preaching as of stravve.) But in
the mean time vve vvil haue our whole
tale of bricke, that is, all our old customs
and ceremonies kept, vvhatsoeuer they
be: and albeit we haue no lavv for thē,
vve vvil make them do as vve vvil haue
them to doe, or els they shal knovv the
price of it. And why so? because (as they
say) vve be idle, & crie, let vs go offer sacrifice:
that is (say they) they neuer leaue
calling to church & to the sermon euery
morning, and there vve must be reproued
for euery fault, and this diet is not
for our humors, & they had as good bee
idle as thus occupied, yet seeing as they
wil needes be so holy, let them: but vve
vvil set them to their task, and see whether
that wil wearie them or no. And as
Pharao vrged those thinges at Israels
hands, which he vvould not touch with
his least finger: so these our Pharaos lay
heauier burthens vpon our backs, then
either prince, or lavv, or conscience vvil

vvarrant. But whē they vrge that which
lavv it selfe doeth iustly require, it is not
of any conscience (for then vvoulde they
come themselues and see it done) but of
malice, & therfore very seldome or neuer
shall wee see some of them at sermons.
But vvhat say they? Let the minister
goe to church and pray for vs, vvee
vvil be at home and vvorke for him: or
els let the minister go to church & pray,
and we wil goe to the alehouse & play.

so long as these people find such fauour
at some mens hands as they doe, it vvill
not be better, but rather vvorse vvith
Gods seruants, and therfore God (if it be
his vvil) turne these Pharaos he arts. But
at the last Israel cried to the Lord, & the
Lord hearde them, Pharao was plagued,
and Israel was released. And vvill not
God novv bee reuerged of his seruantes

many, both godly, vvise & learned, that
in mans iudgement it vvas not the best
course that might be taken, for any man
in vvriting for reformation, to publishe
the ouerthrow of the mightie in Gath,2. Sam. 1. 19. 20
or to tell the faultes of Bishoppes in the
streetes of Askalon, that the daughters
of the Philistins might reioyce, and the
vncircumcised might triumph: yet can
not this be denied, that the Lord, whose
prouidence is ouer and in al things, had
and hath also a stroke in this. And it is to
be feared, that the same God in his ius

dignitie, and duety of Gods ministers,
and thus much both for the persons

            In the second part we are to consider
first of that vvhereunto they are exhorted,
secondly, of the reason vvhy. For
the first, it is repentance, and here is called
a turning againe: alluding to one
that is in a wrong vvay, & cannot come
into the right vvay except hee turne again:
Or els to one in his right vvay, but
had left something behind him, vvithout
vvhich hee coulde not speede in his
iorney, and therefore must needs return
againe.Ieremy 3. 1: 8 But most likely to a vvife that
was diuorced from her husband for adulterie,
and her husband calling to mind
the old and svveet loue that was vvont
to be betvveen them, calleth her againe,
and offereth stil to be her spouse, vpon
this condition, that she vvill become a
nevv vvoman. At these vnstayed staies
vvere vve all by our selues, for by nature
vve are all gone out of the vvay, vve are
corrupt and become abhominable, the

vvaies of peace we haue not knovven,
but then did the Lord call to vs & said,

is, namely,Pro: 24: 16 a continual turning

iniquitie and transgression, and walking
in the nevv vvaies of a holy life, by casting
of the vvorks of darknes,Rom. 13: 12 and putting
on the armor of light. This turning

death of sinne, and the life of righteousnes,
a mortifying of the olde Adam, and
a quickning of the new. It is a conquest

Iesus Christ the righteous) vvee must
therfore put off our olde shooes of our
beastly affections, which carried vs euery
way before,Ephe. 6. 15 and put vpon our feete
the shooes of preparation to the gospel.
In this our turning again vve shal meet
vvith many discouragements, vve must
therefore couer our heads vvith a helmet
of hope:Ephe. 6. 17 and least we should meete
vvith our olde enemies, the deuill, the
vvorld, and our own flesh, to make vs
retire back againe,Ephe. 6. 13 vve must put vpō vs

            If these be the qualities and properties
of true repentance, then are many in
the world farre from true repentance.
The papistsPapistes dispense with murther and
treason, as, the killing of king Iohn, the
prince of Orange, the king of France, and
others can testifie. The price of vvhoredome,
incest, sodometrie, partricide, matricide,
fratricide, and of all sinne, is set
dovvne in the market of Rome, vvhere
Omnia sunt venalia, all is for money, and
the deuil is clarke of the market: Farre
enough therefore are they from true repentance,
neither can they be saued except

they turne againe. Their foolish penance
vvhich consisteth of vvhipping.
creeping to the crosse, going barefoote,
and such like, God neuer required, and
therfore no true repentance, except they
leaue those and turne againe. The TurkeTurkes
is ruled by his alcoran, euen darkenes it
selfe, and not by the word of God; euen
light it selfe, and therefore (so long) hee
cannot turne againe. The IewesI

are far from this turning againe. The AnabaptistAnabaptist

word of God, & relieth vpon his drowsie
dreames, and night reuelations, and
therfore shall hardly, or neuer finde the
right vvaye, excepte hee turne againe.
The NeuterNeuters is for any way, and therefore
shall hardlie or neuer finde the
right way, except he turne again. The
Atheist saith in his heart, there is no
God. The Machiuel with the AtheistAthiests
vvil not know that there is either God
or deuil, hel or heauen, and in all their
actions they quench the spirit of God,
& that one day shal they know to their

cost, except they turne againe. The profane
worldlingworldlinge with Esau weepeth, not
for his sinnes, but for the losse of some
vvorldly commodity, but this is no true
turning againe. The presumptuousPresumptuous person
driueth of all to the last houre, and
therefore is like to be preuented, if in

wethercocke in the winde,Turncoates crieth, this is
the true religion: beleeue me now good
brethren, but he also must turne once againe
by true repentance, before he can
be saued. The church papistChurchpapist turneth in
shewe but not in trueth, and therefore
shal haue his portion vvith hypocrites,

words but not in workes, but because he
bringeth not foorth the fruites of repentance,

he shal be cut downe if in time he

and all that belong vnto God shall one
day turne againe, and my harty desire is
that all might turne againe. Some turne
from poperie to atheisme, from one sin
to another, but to God they cannot turn
except by true repentance they turne againe.
Some turne as dogs doe▪ that is,
eitheir to their vomit againe, or els to

I would to God I could deuise a vvay
to make vsurersVsurers turn againe, but I feare
me I shall not, for they vvhich cā cousin

for me. Vsurie is a deuil that all the disciples
of Christ in England cannot cast

out, for it is a kinde that wil not be cast
out but by fasting and prayer.Marke 5. 3. 4 We read
that there was a man possessed with a
deuill called legion he kept amōgst the
graues, and no man could passe quietlie
by him. I thinke vsurers also are possessed
with the same deuil, for no man can
passe without his markes. The father

can tame vsury, for he hath so many turnings,

like a gentleman, like a marchantman,

turne from disobedience to true obedience,

for the reprouing of the one is the
approuing of the other, and the forbidding
of the one is the commaunding of
the other. And no maruel, for disobedience

it again, by their trothe they see no reason
vvhy it should not be done againe,
but as for this christian exercise, it is inconuenient
in the morning: & if I could
heare that they went to any other exercises
on the day time, I vvould thinke
they spake as they meant: but as they
vvil neuer come at it themselues, so they
see no reason why they may not discourage

a Puritane and a disobedient person.
And yet I denie not but that there may

haue learned to serue the time,

            But here ariseth a questiō, that is this,

Whether a man in turning to God, must
forsake the companie of the vvicked, or
no. If yea (as they must indeede) vvhy did
the Iewes cōtinue stil
                  •

wēttey not to Sion, the place for Gods
vvorship? Or if they coulde not because
they vvere in captiuitie, to vvhat purpose
serued this exhortation? The aunswere
is not hard. There is a turning in
outvvarde action, and affection. In outvvard
action, when a man doeth that
vvhich he ought to doe, and may lavvfully
and conuementlie doe 
                  〈◊〉
               . In affection,
vvhen a man would doe that which

outwardly by imprisonment, sicknes,

by some natural infirmitie. Ex

could not being led captiue into the law
of sinne.Rom. 7 So we in many things may turn
both in outward action and affection, as
from idolatrie to the gospel, from ignorance
to knowledge, & in many thinges
moe. Some thinges are yet vvanting
which the church should haue (if shee
had her right) as namely a learned ministerie
throughout the land, and that holy
and auncient discipline vvhich was in
the primitiue church: but as yet we cannot
haue them, and therefore seeing in
outward action wee cannot haue them,
we haue them in affection: that is, wee
pray for them, wee would gladly haue
them if we might lawfully come by thē,

my meaning, and so much for turning a
gaine.
            Novv followeth the reason of the
exhortatiō, in these vvords: for I am your
Lord. The word Lord in the original sig
nifieth to commaunde as a Lord, or to
rule as a husbande: either is sufficient, so
the sense be taken: as if he should say, it is
good reason thou shouldest turn again
for thou hast entered a couenant vvith
me, and married thy selfe vnto me, and
therfore I haue power ouer you, and interest
in you. This being the sense, the
doctrine shalbee this. First, that it is neuer
in vaine to turne to the Lord, for such
is his loue to those whose names are
once written in his book of electiō, that
finally he vvil not forsake thē, but most
mercifully embrace them vvhensoeuer
they shal faithfully turn vnto him. Neither

doeth he snew vsfauour in this sort,
or in any sort because we by our turning
againe haue deserued it, as the papistes
say, but because of his free and vndeserused
loue he hath made vs this promise.
And if any shal thinke that of himself h
                  •
               
hath wil and power to turne to God by
true repentance, hee is deceiued, for by

all the world, and shall not the obedience
of one mā, Christ Iesus, saue al that

Is he the seed of the vvoman that brake

(say they) there is righteousnes inherent
in vs, as the accident in the subiect. To
vvhich wee ansvvere, first, though this
be true in philophie, yet is it false in diuinitie,

Secondly, there is righteousnes
in vs, as sinne vvas in Christ, but Christ
had no sinne really of his ovvne, but of
ours by imputation, neither haue vve any
righteousnes of our ovvn really, but
of Christes by imputatiō. Thirdly, God
by his good spirit beginneth tighteousnes
in vs euen in this life, but it is imperfect,
and polluted so soon as it commeth

But yet say the Papists, as our euil works
are auailable to condemnation, so our
good workes are to saluation: for (say
they) Contrariorum contraria est ratio.
               
The comparison is vnlike, and holdeth
not: for first, our sinnes are of our selues,
our righteousnes is of God: secondly, our
sinnes are perfectly euil, our good is imperfect:
thirdly, he that is guiltie of one
commaundement is guiltie of all, and
deserueth damnation: shal vve therefore
conclude,Iames 2, 10 that hee vvhich keepeth one,
deserueth saluation? most absurde to
graunt. No, no beloued, both our conuersion
and saluation be the free worke
and gift of God. Heauen is our inheritance,Ephe. 1. 
               ergo no purchase by vs.Luke 12: 32 It hath
pleased our father to geue vs the kingdome,
ergo vve get it not by our selues.
Saint Iohn saith,Iohn 10. 7 Christ is the dore by
vvhich wee must enter.Actes 10. 12 S. Peter saith,
There is no other name vnder heauen
whereby we can be saued, but onely the
name of Iesus Christ. And therefore to
ioyne Christ with vs, and his perfecte
righteousnes with our broken workes,
euen vnholines it selfe, were but to put
new cloth into an old garment,Mat. 9. 16. 17 and so
to make the rent worse, to put nevve
wine into old bottels, and to lose all, to

build halfe vpon Christ, and part vpon
our selues,

                   Cor. 3. 11. 12 were to set part of our house
vpon the foundation, & part beside the
foundatiō, and so to bring al vnder foot.
And therefore if we wil be wise builders,
let vs not doe so vnwisely, but let vs ascribe
all wholly and onely to our good
God, who hath so loued vs in Christ Iesus,
that albeit we haue bene disobediēt
                  •

            This doctrine is necessary for 2. sorts
of mē. First, for those that are too much
oppressed with the burthen of their sin,
euen to despaire: these men are to know
that Christ spake to them, when he said,
Come vnto me all you that are heauie lo
                     •
                  
den, and I will ease you.
               Mat. 11. 28 And the prophet
here speaketh vnto them whē he saith,

               O'ye disobedient children turne again, for
I am your Lord Let them onely beleue,
and pray Lord help my vnbeliefe. And
let not this be the questiō,Marke 9, 24 whether God
wil be their good Lorde or no, or whether
they shalbe saued or no, but whether
they be surely perswaded of Gods
loue toward thē in Christ, or no,Rom. 8. 38 which
if they haue, then if they turne againe
God wil stil be their Lord. The seconde
sorte are such as are not at all touched
with their sinnes, but drenched in the
sea of 
                  •
               innes, and feele not the waues: in
the midst of the fire, yet feele not the
flame▪ Gods iudgementes are present,
hel gates are gaping, death redy to strike
them, yet they not abashed. No threatning,
no promise, no example, nothing
wil make them forgoe their sinnes, that
God may forgeue them: God make vs
feele our sinnes, that wee may turne againe,
for this cōfort belongeth to none
but to those that in obedience turne to
God by Iesus Christ our Lorde.Eay 1, 16▪. 7, 18 19 The second
thing that from hence we learne is
this, that the cōsideration of Gods loue

towards vs should moue vs to serue him
in true obedience. This argument did
Moses vse to the Israelites. The Lord
(saith he) vvill curse thy enemyes,D
                     •
                  ut: 30. 7. 8 and
them that hate the and persecute thee:
returne therfore, and obey the voice of
the Lorde, and doe all his commandementes.
The same argument did Ioshua
vse. The Lorde (saith he) hath giuen you
a land wherin you did not labor,Iosh. 23. 13. 14 cities
vvhich yee builded not, and vineyardes
vvhich you planted not. Novv therfore
feare the Lorde your God, & serue him
in vprightnes and truth. The same argument
doeth Dauid vse, My soul (saith
he) the Lord hath forgeuen thy sinnes,Psal.

                  03. 1.
healed thy infirmitie, and satisfied thy
mouth vvith good things, therefore my
soule praise thou the Lord, and all that
is vvithin me praise his holy name. The
same reason doeth Ieremie vse here, (or
rather the Lord) Turne again & be obedient,
& vvhy? for I am your Lorde. The
same reason ought also to moue euerie
one of vs to feare the Lord, for with him
is mercie that he may be feared.Psalme 130. 4 Applie

vve this to our selues. No nation hath
been longer vrged with this argument
then this our English nation: but hath
it perswaded Englande to obey God?
God indeed hath made vs his vineyard,
and done for vs vvhat he possibly could
deuise, by planting,Esai 5.

haue vve not degenerated from our
duety more then any nation? I would to
God vve had not. For thus standes the
case vvith vs, the more loue, the les duetie:
the more mercie, the lesse pittie: the
more peace, the lesse quiet: the more
knowledge, the les practise: come Spaniards,
and vve hold together: goe Spaniards,
vve fall asunder: come sicknes, &

            The last thing that from this reason I
obserue, is this: that seeing as the loue of
God is so free, so continuall, so vndeserued,
and so vnspeakeable, that therefore
vvee set more by it then by any loue in
the vvorld. Great vvas the loue of Damon
