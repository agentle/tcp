To make knowen the cauſers of

wherein he hathe and yet
putteth hym ſelfe in

for the pacifyeng
of the ſame.

            IMPRINTED AT

            A SECONDE DECLARATION
OF THE PRINCE
of Conde to make knowen the cauſers
of the troubles whiche are at
this daye in this realme, and
the dutie wherein he hath
and yet putteth himſelf
in at this preſent for
the pacifieng of
the ſame.
            
               
                  ALTHOVGH the
prince of Conde haue
by good proofe ſufficiently
inough declared
nat alonely the great
zeale & deuocion which
he hath to ye ſeruice of
ye kyng & quene, with the ful obediēce he
beareth to their maieſties: but alſo ye ſingular
affectiō he hath to ye quiet & welth
of this realme, chiefly herein, that not
long ſens he hath deferred euen to the
vttermoſt extremitie and nede, to putte
armour vpon him, for to reſyſt the violence
of theſe, who yet beeyng full of

blood and threats, haue ſent for and aſſembled
people on euery ſyde: hauynge
armed them ſelues againſte their maieſties
commaundementes, and dyd with
force enter Parys. Where at that tyme
the ſaid Prince was, who had neuer the
leſſe long before perfecte vnderſtanding
of their ententes and purpoſes. And
after that, hauyng no reſpecte eyther to
the degree he is of in this Realme, neyther
yet to this, that he was not the firſt
that armed hym ſelf, was yet contented
ſimply at the quenes commandement to
departe the ſayd towne with his traine,
and repaire to his houſe mynding forthwith
to breake vp his companye, vppon
truſt that the others ſhould do the ſame:
The which all contrary remained at the
ſayd Parys ſome dayes, and there renforced
them ſelues: And after they had
there doon ſundry gorgeous actes, went
with all theyr force where their maieſties
were, whome they haue enuironned
therwith, and therby brought their
bodies and willes into a captiuitie.
            Neuertheles the ſaid prince who hauing
nothing derer vnto hym than ye publique

tranquillitie, hath always ben moſt wylling
to ſubmit him ſelf to ſuch reaſonable
conditions of layeng downe that weapō
which he for moſt iuſte conſiderations ſo
nedefully tooke in hande: That all they
euē very thoſe whom the other ſide hath
diſpatched vnto him on the behalf of the
King & Queene, haue always ſayd, that
whoſoeuer ſhould refuſe the condicions
that he offered, ſhuld be in a great wrong
Wherof at this preſent, the ſayd prince
neither maketh mention nor recitall, becauſe
the ſame haue bene already declared
in his former declaration. And fearing
leaſt his reaſons and anſwers, that

                  •
               ithe the offer of his condicions he hathe
made touching that meſſage which was
ſent vnto him and perſuaded him on the
behalf of the queene at the deſire of thoſe
others, haue not bene faithefully reported
vnto her maieſtye: or els that theſe
who haue power about her, might 
                  •
               appilye
diſguiſe the ſame, to make righte
appeare on theyr ſyde: whereby they
myght nouriſhe and continue this trouble,
preferryng theyr particular faccions
before the conſeruation and quietneſſe

of this eſtate: The ſayde Prince
would by no meanes omytt the putting
of the ſame into writyng, to the
                  〈…〉
               de they
myghte be truely vnderſtande of their
maieſties, publiſhed through all chriſtendome
and knowen to all the princes, potentates,
allies, frendes and confederates
to this crowne, and to all the courſes
of parliamentes of this realme, whō
the ſayd prince requireth (but chiefly the
parlyament of Parys) to the whiche he
hath of late ſent his former declaration,
to enregeſter the ſame with this his ſeconde
alſo, to thende he maye hereafter
rendre the better accompte of theſe his
doynges, by a moſte certaine and perpetuall
witneſſe vnto his prince, whan he
ſhall come to the age of iudgement betwene
the faulte or ſeruice that he ſhall
haue doone hym in this his minoritie.
The ſayd Prince ſo muche aſſuring him
ſelfe of the ſo rare integritie of that notable
companye ſo well eſteemed of the
whole worlde, that it will examine and
way all thynges with the balance of iuſtice
reaſon & equitie without inclinyng
to any paſſion or affection of any particular

partie.
            
               AND fyrſt and formoſt to begin with
al they ar not able nor may lay vnto the
princes charge eyther to haue begun the
trouble whiche at this daye is in this realme,
eyther to haue ben the cauſe or continuance
therof: in as much as it is manifeſt,
he was not the fyrſte that put on
armour. And for that he tooke weapon
after them, which armed themſelues againſt
the kyng and quenes commandement:
he had therin iuſt occaſion, & ſuche
as by nature belōged vnto hym: to wete
the defence of his prince to the vtmoſte
of his power, the ſubiectes lykewiſe of
his maieſtie, and himſelf from violence.
In as muche alſo as ſyns that tyme he
hathe alwayes ſubmytted hym ſelfe to
the laying downe of weapon vnder reaſonable
condytions, ſuche as myghte
tend to a good and ſure peace for eyther
partie, and the libertie of the kyng and
quene. Wherby men may eaſily know
that theſe be thonly cauſes which haue
reiected the ſaid conditions (who nat beyng
able to ſuffre the rule of the Quene
which gouerned without force or violēce

keepyng eche manne in quiete, and lookyng
carefully for payement of the king
her ſonnes debtes, haue armed theym
ſelues, haue entred the court, haue paſſed
euen to the kynges chaumber with
their force contrary to his commaundement
to diſpoſe of this realme at theyr
pleaſure, haue made ſlaughter of his
maieſties ſubiects, who lyued vnder the
ſufferaunce of his Edictes: And conſequently
haue put all Fraunce in an vprore,
euen than whan it grewe towardes
greate quieteneſſe, chiefely for the
matter of religion, wherin eyther partie
deemed muche cauſe of contentation.
            And without taryeng onely vpon this
whyche men ſee at this preſente, if they
woulde enter a lyttell further into the
matter, and conſyder the humors and
dooynges that haue paſte eche manne
frome tyme to tyme, and looke yet further
afore them, who they be that haue
heretofore rayſed and maynteyned the
troubles ſprong in this realme: They
ſhall fynde that euen thoſe, who of late
haue begun to put on armour and ſtyrred

vp this Ciuile warre, haue almoſte
from theyr byrthe vp, conſpired to trouble
the commune quiete of this kyngedome,
and that reſtfulneſſe wherof they
bee thennemies, becauſe it is contrarye
to the marke they ſhoote at, and cuttes
awaye the meane of theyr ambicion,
whoe thynke them ſelues in priſon, and
neuer in good ordre, but whan there is
occaſions of changes and enterpriſes.
And without any mention making, concerning
this mater of a iudgement whiche
king Frauncis the .i. that greate and
wiſe king made of them, neyther yet of
ſundry other particularities of their doynges.
Who knoweth not the ſelfe ſame
men becauſe they coulde not away with
the benefyte of a commune quiete were
the cauſe of breache of that honourable
and moſte profytable Truce made betwene
kyng Henry laſtly departed, the
Emperor Charles, and the Spanyſhe
kyng? (whereby not onely we feele the
ſmarte, but all our poſteritie ſhall feele
the ſame. They putting by this meanes
al Europe in trouble and confuſion, and

all Fraunce in ruine, that they mights
therby come to their endes and intentes
well enough vnderſtanded? And who
when they had ones embraced the handlynge
of matters and the money, after
the iorney of ſaint Laurence, whan ſundry
greefes one after an other had hapned
by reaſon of that ouerthrow, began
by tymes to make ſuche vnquietneſſe in
this realme, as the ſaid kyng Henry departed,
who was not able to ſuffre any
more ſuch violent ſprights aboute hym,
determined to ſend them home to theyr
houſes, had he not ben preuēted by deth.
            After that duryng the reigne of kyng
Francis the ſecond of that name, when
theſe ſtranger gouernors had contrary
to all ryght, yea agaynſt the lawes and
cuſtomes of Fraunce, vſurped vnto
theym ſelues the whole gouernemente,
was not this poore realme in troubles
and in armes? Dyd they nat in the ſight
of euery man fleſhe the ſayd yong kyng
vpon his owne prepre ſubiects (who yet
otherwiſe was both good & vertuous of
himſelf) and haue they not done what in
them lay to defile his memory & cronicle

with their excedyng cruelties? Dydde
they not cauſe hym to arme hym ſelfe
and make a campe in the myddes of hys
realme agaynſte hys owne ſeruauntes
wyth ſo horrible a ſhewe of myſerye and
heauyneſſe through all hys realme, that
euerye manne yet doth abhorre to talke
therof, and bryng it thereby to remembraunce?
And to make an ende of thys
theyr Tragedye: haue not all men ſeene
after the death of the ſayde king Frauncis
when their violente rule ceaſed: the
Queene and the kynge of Nauarre,
by one conſente and correſpondence to
haue ruled together all this eſtate peaſybly
and wyth all Iuſtice and clemency,
thirtene whole monethes? tyll ſuche
tyme as theyr ambition (whyche wyll
neuer ſuffre theym to kepe in, and lyue
in reſte) hadde ſtyrred theim vppe, and
puſht them forewardes with theyr good
agentes and miniſters to trouble heauen
and earth, as all men may ſee, and
that to the great ſorow of the ſaid prince
who doubteth not but all perſones of
good and ſound iudgemēt, do right well
knowe thoſe that haue ben the occaſion

of begynnyng, maintaynyng, and continuyng
the troublyng of this realme:
Wherby men can not without ſlander,
charge them, that haue alwaies by good
proofe ſhewed them ſelues as well the
ſhunners of ſuche meanes and inuentions,
as alſo of thoſe honors and ryches
whych contrary wyſe theſe others haue
obteyned, by ſuche gaye meanes as is
moſte euident.
            Secondarily, ſo lyttell ought men to
meruayle, yf the ſayde prynce in this
caſe woorke ſurely with thoſe that haue
the King and Quene at this day in their
poſſeſſion, that rather menne myghte
thynke it a great foly in him, if he ſhold
otherwyſe vſe the matter, and ſhould ſo
farre forgette hymſelfe, as to putt hym
to theyr mercy, remembring the ſtrange
maner of dealynge, wherewith he was
intreated by them nat long ago, when
through theyr taken on authoritie they
commaunded all in this realme. In as
muche alſo as it is moſte certayne, the
marke they ſhoote at, tendeth to none
other ende, than to the whole ruine of
the more parte of the nobilitie, and of

all other eſtates what ſoeuer, that make
profeſſion of the refourmed Religion,
chiefly that, of the prince and al his company.
Whiche thyng is moſte euidently
to bee wytneſſed by the very mouthes
of the duke of Guyſe, and the Conſtable
themſelues, and by ſuche talke as they
helde in the full court of the parliament
of Parys, vſynge theſe propre termes,
That fyrſt of all, they muſt begyn with
Parys, and that afterwardes they wold
well ynough rule the reſt, and ſo would
deale, that men ſhold know of what religion
eche man was, chiefely ſuche as
had any authoritie, and that the principall
meanyng of the kynge was, to depart
the company that was at Orleance
& after that he wold not haue his handes
tyed vp. But in as much as it hath lyen
in the power of ſome, through theyr particular
affections, to breake a lawe ſo ſolemnely
made, as was the Edict of Ianuary
laſt paſt, wherby all this Realme
grewe to a quietneſſe: And further that
whiche of late was reſolued on vpon a
ſaterday nat long ſens in full councell,
whiche was, that the ſayd Edict ſhould

bee publiſhed without any exception or
reſtraint of the town of Paris, and that
precinct: yf this I ſaye were broken and
violated and the reſtraint for Paris paſſed
in the courte of parliament by their
practiſes and thorough thautoritie they
take vpon them: menne may therby eaſily
perceaue how the queene is obe
                  •
               ed,
What power ſhe is of, and howe theyr
wylles, paſſions and particular affections
ar aboue her pleaſure, and the determination
of the councell: and it is lykewiſe
eaſy to iudge by all their ſaiynges
and doyngs that as ſpedely as they may
they will cauſe the whole realme to doe
as thei haue begun with Paris and that
libertie or baylywick: and ſo conſequently
there is no truſt nor aſſurāce to be had
to their letters of proclamation, as may
very well bee witneſſed by the cry, that
ſince that time was made the xx. of thys
monthe, in the foure quarters or qua
                  ••
               
               foulx
of Paris for the calling together of
all the gentlemen of this realme to goe
fight againſt and puniſhe the ſedicious &
new chriſtians▪ and here it hath no likelyhode
of truth to ſaye that the people of

Paris coulde neuer haue endured the edict,
nor haue ſubmitted thēſelues therunto.
For euerye man ſawe three monthes
together, firſt the prince de la roche
ſur Yon, and afterwardes the marſhall
Montmerency with only x. or xii. harque
buſiers, ſo to haue kept in order ye whole
people there, as there was no worde nor
queſtion of brawling the one with the other.
which thing peaſably endured tyll
the commyng of the ſayd Duke of Guiſe
to Paris. Wheruppon it is good is
marke that when towards the ende, the
ſaid marſhals bande was encreaſed and
made ſtronger with certayne horſemen
and footemen, to lette ſuch metinges as
men ſawe were appointed purpoſelye to
ſtirre vp the people: it was then perſuaded
by the prouoſt of the merchants, and
by thoſe of the toune, yt it was not nedefull
to kepe ſuch a force there, which ſerued
to none other purpoſe, thā to greue
the people, whome it was eaſy without
any ſuch numbre, to kepe in order: & yet
notwithſtanding ſince the commyng of
the ſayd Duke of Guiſe, the ſayde people
haue ſoo chaunged theyr humour

and it hath been ſo hard a matter to kepe
them in (as theſe men at leaſt wold make
vs beleue) that of neceſſitie they muſte
leuie ſuch nombres of enſeignes of foote
men, as men haue ſeene, and that without
makyng the Queene priuie therto,
yea and agaynſte her pleaſure alſo.
Laſtly the ſayd Prince knoweth it to be
the woorke of God, that the ſayd Duke
of Guiſe and Conſtable, haue nat bene
able in publike and in ſo great a company
to diſſemble their meanyng, and that
they haue no more ſaid than they thinke
for: a matter ſurely that muche confirmeth
ſuche talke as is ordinarie among
their familiers and houſehold ſeruants,
whiche alſo hathe been well knowen by
an infinite numbre of letters taken vp
by the way: that is, that they deſyre no
more than to diſſolue the companye at
Orleance, as they may afterwarde doo
execution as well on the greate as the
ſmall, accordyng to their long deuiſed
meanyng. Whervppon they make oftentimes
ſuche ſlaughters and cruelties
as of late hath ben exerciſed in Parys as

well in the preſence of the ſayd Conſtable
and vnder his priuate authoritie, as
alſo ſuche as are dayely commytted in
ſundrye places agaynſte thoſe of the reformed
Religion, namely that horrible
and deteſtable murther made at Sens,
an archebyſhoprike appertaynynge to
the Cardinall of Guyſe, whyche hadde
neuer come to paſſe withoute this their
newe enterpriſe, and the auowed example
that theſe men haue geuen. Of
whyche calamitie with all other deſolations
that Fraunce is thretned withall,
the faulte can not bee imputed to other
than theym ſelues onely. And concernyng
that meſſage, whych the Queene
ſent vnto the ſaid Prince, to wete: That
he ſhoulde vnarme hymſelfe vppon her
woorde and affiaunce, that he ſhoulde
come to the courte, where he ſhoulde be
wel receyued, and that further ſhe wold
by wrytynge, make hym all ſuche aſſurance
as hym ſelfe woulde: The ſayde
Prince geueth to vnderſtand, yt he hath
none other deſire than to obey the wyll
and pleaſure of that good Lady, and to
ſee euery man in quiet: but he right well

vnderſtandeth, that thoſe diſpatches and
all others are at this day at thonly appetite
of thaboueſaid, and can not perceiue
that her maieſtie (howe good wil ſoeuer
ſhe haue) can make hym any ſuretie, ſo
long as ſhe remaineth in their powers,
and whyle they ſhall abyde aboute the
king and her. For what meane hath ſhe
to reſiſt them, or any enterpriſe they ſhal
attempt, being enuironned with theyr
force and armour which thei themſelues
haue leuied and aſſembled, and whiche
they haue preſumed to brynge into the
kynges houſe and chambre agaynſt his
pleaſure, and expreſſe inhibition? As litell
ſuretie is it alſo to ſaye, the kyng of
Nauarre (whom the ſayd Prince and al
thoſe of his company, doo acknowledge
next after the king and quene) ſhall only
haue the force of the Kynges Lieutenant
generall, if a man marke theyr enterpriſe
of poſſeſſyng hym, and the abuſyng
of his goodneſſe. Withall it is not
to be douted, but that the force and people
which they haue aſſembled (in whoſe
hande ſo euer they ſhall come) wyll bee
at their deuotion, and wyll bee obedient

to their willes and intentes. Whereby
they ſhall alwais be able to ſerue theim
ſelues with them againſt the will & pleſure
of the ſaid quene and kyng of Nauarre,
yea againſt their perſones whan
ſo euer they will, as they haue right wel
alredy made that to be knowē vnto that
good Lady, and the aforeſaid kyng whā
they had power, authoritie and mean to
hurt within their rule (wherof if it wold
pleaſe them but a little to thinke on) thei
ſhuld finde that thonly goodnes of God
hath hitherto preſerued theim. To bee
ſhort, the ſaid prince can not with reſon
ſee any other ſuretie than their withdrawing
frō the court. And firſt of al the ful
libertie of ye quene, aſſuring himſelf yt as
often as there ſhall remaine preſentely
any other force in this realme (chiefly at
this time of an vniuerſal peace, thā thordinarie
gard of the king with ye frontier
places accuſtomed, it can not be (conſydering
their dealings and councels ſufficiētly
diſcouered) but the ſame is to do
ſome forcible & violent execution: for he
doubteth nat but as thei haue preſumed
to aſſemble their ſaid force, ſo wil thei as

lytle feare to employ them for the bryngynge
to paſſe of theyr purpoſe. whiche
thng maketh thoſe that muſt kepe them
ſelues frome ſuche ſnares, not ouer haſtyly
to beleue words, onleſſe ſome good
proues dyd enſue, whyche they ſee euidentely
to bee all contrarie. For it appeereth,
that the aboueſayde vtter all
tokens of ſtomacke and ennemit
                  •
               e that
they canne deuyſe, agaynſte the ſayde
Prince and theſe of his company, whom
they proclayme thorough oute all the
worlde rebelles, and thennemies of the
kyng. They make prouiſyons for their
chiefe houſes, they threatten them with
no leſſe than lyfe, they cauſe many falſe
brutes and ſlanders to be ſowen againſt
the dedes of the ſayde Prince, they doo
moreouer make leuies of footemen, as
well within as withoute the Realme,
they practiſe with ſtraungers and embaſſadours,
partely vnder the name of
the kyng and quene, and partly without
the knowledge of any theyr maieſties.
They make no difficultie in cauſyng the
kyng to arme hym ſelfe agaynſt thoſe of
his Subiectes, of whom he was before

theyr gay enterpriſe and arriual, obeyd
faythfully and wyllyngely, & ſo ſhall always
be to their laſte. And for this purpoſe
cauſe his Maieſtie to entre into a
charge that euyll commeth to paſſe, they
thynke it good to beſtow the money appoynted
for his debts (which yet be ſuch
as eche man knoweth) vpon the driuyng
out and deſtroyeng of the more parte of
his nobilitie and all other eſtates, which
is, as though a manne would cutt of his
own armes and legges, and wold make
an ende of the ruinyng of this realme,
which by their goodly councell, conduict
and gouernment, is brought to the ſtate
that all menne ſee. Finally, theſe wiſe
heades of this realme care not to laye
out this land to the pray, deuiſyng with
them ſelues how to bryng in ſtrangers,
and to withdrawe the bandes and moſte
notable ſouldiours frome the places of
moſte importance, as namely Caleys &
Mets, vnto the which it is nat to be douted,
but oure ennemies looke narowly
inough. And all this to ſerue their priuate
paſſion, likyng better to folow the
courſe of their ambition, and comme to

to their appointed end what euer it coſt,
yea were it with ye loſſe of al ye realm, thā
to fail any whit of their intēt. What ſuretie
thā wold a mā loke ye prince ſhould
find hauing ſuch demōſtratiōs & effectes
of their moſt wicked wills & meanings?
            As touching the perſuaſion vſed to the
prince wherin it is ſaid, yt he ought to for
get his particular profit for ye cōmon: he
thinketh yt wer fitter to be perſuaded vnto
thē, who hauing firſt & moſt greuouſly
fauted hole on ſo welfauoredly that they
had rather ſee a great part of the realme
periſh than (for the cōſeruation therof, &
to giue ſuretie to thoſe that haue occaſion
to ſeke it) they wold once ſtirre from
the court, where as yet there is no good
ſubiect that had nat rather chuſe to abſent
hym ſelf thens all his lyfe for to redeme
ſuche an inconuenient than to ſee
(thorough his preſence) his countrey in
danger, & his king anoyed. But to color
their obſtinate wil in biding at the court
they allege their offices & eſtates, ſaying
yt for ſomuch as they be officers vnto the
croune, no mā ought nor can cauſe them

                  •
               o withdraw thēſelues frō about ye kynges

perſon, being ſpecially in his minoritie.
Nay they haue ben ſo loftie as thei
haue not let to ſay, that the kyng in his
vnder age had none authoritie to cauſe
them to depart as though the quene did
not ſupplie the tender age of the kyng:
yea and haue thoughte it more mete by
reaſon of their callyngs to tarie ſtyll at
the court to diſobey and trouble the ſtate
than by their departynge to leaue good
example, to geue authoritie vnto the
kynges commaundemente, and to allowe
the gouernement of the Queene,
wherin they lack all good and iuſt groūd
if they wold well wey the preſent neceſſitie
and occaſion. For it is moſte certain
they neuer had rule geuē thē ouer theyr
charges, to employe them at their pleaſure,
nor to vnquiet the realme, by tranſgreſſyng
the lawes, armyng themſelues
not onely without the kynges commandemente,
but againſte his pleaſure, nor
to doo ſuche violences, but to mainteyn
the lande in peace and quieteneſſe, as it
was before their comyng, and afore they
putte on armoure by theyr owne commyſſion,
abuſynge theyr charges, and

preſuming more than at any time durſte
any of the propre brethern of any of our
kynges, who yet thoughe they returned
from the battaile, durſte neuer enter the
court, but they were firſt diſarmed.
Now foraſmuch as thorow their arriual
and preſence at the court together, with
their goodly behauior, they ſe they haue
made ſuche a ſtirre as thereby they haue
ſet all Fraunce in trouble and fyer, and
haue moued a Ciuile warre, and that
contrarywyſe thonely attonement and
quiete of this land dependeth vpon their
withdrawyng frome the courte, in as
muche as the ſayd prince can ſee no nother
meane neyther for the common ſuretie,
nor for the libertie of the kyng and
Queene. And that for hys parte he is
reſolued neuer to commytte hymſelfe to
theyr mercie (as no man woulde thinke
it reaſonable he ſhoulde) it is moſte certaine,
that if they bee good and louyng
ſeruauntes and officers to this croune,
they will in this caſe forget all particularitie:
In as muche as the ſayd prince
alſo, who is not onely an officer and ſeruant,
but hath this honor to be accompted

a kynſemanne, and is iſſued of the
howſe and bloudde: who by thys occaſyon
hathe greatter pryuiledge and
righte to tarye aboute his maieſtye. beſydes
this alſo that he was not the firſte
in armes: And that contrariwiſe thother
ſide haue nothing ſatiſfied the requeſt of
the eſtates as they be bound before they
ſhould be admitted of the kings councel
doth notwtſtanding offer to wtdraw him
ſelf into his houſe and gouernment, and
likewiſe to procure that all the other lordes
and officers of the croune which bee
in his company ſhall do the lyke. Whervnto
if the aboueſaid do not condeſcend,
The ſayde prince aſſureth himſelfe that
there is no man oneleſſe he bee to muche
paſſionate, but will thynke that it is not
he, but only they that profer the priuate
afore the publike cauſe.
            Now if thoſe good officers of the croun
ſhall not contente themſelues with thys
reaſonable offer, and wil nedes vrge examples,
thei muſt than in ſpight of their
bearde confeſſe this meane offred to bee
reaſonable expedient and acuſtomed, in
as much as it is the ſame way which mē
               
know by a nūber of examples paſt, yt our
predeceſſours kings haue folowed, who
whē there aroſe any ſuch controuerſy betwene
ye princes their ſubiects as y• therby
they toke armes ye one prince againſt
thother of theyr priuat authority: by and
by they wer cōmaūded to lay doun weapon
on either ſide, and to wtdraw thēſelues
into their houſes, yt afterward they
might come & geue accōpt of their doinges,
& their cōtrouerſies & reaſons to bee
heard when they ſhuld be called thervnto.
At the leaſte if againſt all reaſon and
cuſtome they haue determined to ſuffre
thoſe at the court, which are but offcers
of the croune withall the force they haue
aſſembled of their owne priuate authoritie:
They canne not then deny, but that
they ſhall do an euident wrong vnto the
ſayd prince (who hath this honour to belong
to the kyng, and who did not firſte
arme himſelfe but put them on after the
other for none other purpoſe thā to kepe
their maieſties, and hymſelfe frome violence)
yf he may not haue the like priuiledge
to be at the court with thoſe of his
band who owe as well their othe to the
king as the others, and who he will aſſure

of his honor and life, to be the moſt
faithfull and obedient ſeruants and ſubiectes
of his maieſtye (as they both haue
and hereafter will make it right well to
be ſene) And than beyng there they may
receiue the king of Nauars commaūdementes
as the kings lieuetenant generall,
and aſſiſt him as wel as the others,
& withal help him to maintain the libertie
and authoritie of the king & Queene
with all their power, for whoſe ſeruyce
they are readye to beſtow their bodies &
goods to the laſt peny & vttermoſt breth.
But if it happē that ye aboueſaid wil not
ſuffer the quene to vſe this equality moſt
reaſonable without it may appeare that
there is more partialitie towards thone
thā ye other (although in dede if there be
ani affectiō born, ye ſame wer chiefly due
to ye prince, who hath this honor to be of
ye bloud) and yt for ye meting wt ſo preſēt a
deſolatiō the ſaid lady do not wt ſo iuſt a
cauſe otherwiſe ētermedle her auctoriti
thā hitherto ſhe hath, mē cānot ſai yt ther
hath lacked any good wil in her to do the
ſame, being ſo wiſe & vertuous a lady as
ſhe is, and one that ſo coueteth ye greatnes
of her ſunne and the preſeruation of

his eſtate and ſurety, that ſhe would not
ſpare any perſon in a mater of ſuch importance
and that threateneth ſo great
a ruine: but yet they wil put them ſelues
out of all doubte, that it is the feare ſhe
hath of them, who kepe their force continually
about her, and will not ſuffer her
to do a thyng ſo nedefull, whiche thynge
they haue ſufficient proue inough of that
her maieſtie is brought into ſuch termes
yt ſhe leaueth to do ſundry things, & paſſeth
a mayny againſte her pleaſure, as it
may right wel appere by the new electiō
of thoſe which haue lately ben called to ye
priuie councell: whiche men righte well
know to haue bene choſen to make vp a
number, & to kepe the ſayd Lady in ſubiection
vnder pretence of a councel: For
men do otherwiſe ſufficiently inough vnderſtand
the ſaid lady to be very choiſe in
admitting any perſon to the degree of a
counceler. Men doo alſo know the ſmall
reſpect theſe perſons haue towards her,
whiche at this time make their councels
to gether aparte, and afterwarde cauſe
her to ſet forth thoſe thinges themſelues
haue agreed on: they ſend out the diſpatches,

and after tell her the matter: they
force the courte of parliament to paſſe at
their pleaſure, whatſoeuer they enterpriſe,
and what ſo ſeemeth good to them
manifeſtly ſhewyng to haue more credit
and authoritie therin than euer the king
and quene could haue. To be ſhort, who
is he that wyll not thinke it at this preſent
more than meete, that the ſayd lady
ſhold take vpon her again her authoritie
without beyng any longer thus compaſſed
with theſe men of warr, and that the
aboue named doe withdraw themſelues
with all their force, for the remeuyng of
that feare and ſuſpicion that they haue
(not without occaſion) geuen to ſo many
and withall to remedye thoſe miſeries,
wherewith this ſtate is threatened: and
this the rather becauſe the ſaid prince beyng
aſſured of his companye, who be of
the beſt ſeruaunts of this croune, and others
with hym of all other eſtates, are
determined once for all, to prooue theyr
fortune, and to beſtowe their liues euen
to the laſte droppe of theyr bloud, rather
thanne to ſee the force of thys realme in
the handes of ſuche as it nothynge beelongeth

vnto, who haue abuſed the ſame
afore time with ſo great loſſe of the kinges
ſubiects, and now of late haue made
ſuch boucheries and oultrages agaynſte
thoſe of that religion, which the Prince
is of, wythout any regarde hadde to the
kinges decrees, that at the leaſte he will
be wel ware while he liueth how he ſhal
commit hym ſelfe to their mercy, wherewith
he hath afore tyme founde himſelfe
euill apayd.
            And for the remeuing of all ſuch ſlaunders
and complaintes as the aboueſaide
cauſe to be made agaynſt the ſaid prynce
(chiefly this which they greatly ſett forwards)
that he and thoſe of his company
areſt and open the pacquets of ye king: he
hartely wiſheth men would vnderſtand
that he hath alwais born ſuch a reuerēc
                  •
               
and will do all his life, to that which belongeth
vnto his maieſtye: As he hathe
from the beginning expreſſly forbidden
any man to lay handes on the kings, the
Quenes or the Kynge of Nauarres letters.
True it is that the ſame hathe not
bene obſerued, (as alſo it were not reaſonable)
with the pacquets of the other

particulers whiche haue both ben ſtaied
and opened: In the whych menne haue
ſeene a worlde of iniquitye of vntrue
reportes, ſlaunders, falſe Brutes, practiſes,
pourpoſes, and enterpryſes incredible,
all contrarye to that goodlye
talke of ſuretye, wherewyth they dayelye
feede the ſayde Pryrnce, who no
whytte repenteth hym of that he hathe
doone, neyther would for thys reſpecte
the thynge ſhoulde haue beene otherwyſe
vſed. In as muche as thereby he
hath the more depely knowen their cankred
willes.
            Touchyng the breakyng doune of ymages
cōmitted at Tours & Blois, the
ſaid prince and thoſe of his cōpany haue
benmuch offended therwith, in ſuch ſort
as he hath ſēt word to the kings officers
in the ſayd tounes that he wyll help thē
and aſſiſte with ſtrong hande to ſee thoſe
puniſhed, in the example of others that
haue cōmitted that crime. His behauior
that he hathe vſed, in this toune of Orleans
with the commendation of all eccleſiaſticall
perſonnes and the publyke

thankes geuen hym by all ſortes of men
here, and other eſtates doo ryghte well
witneſſe the good order of his lyfe, with
that modeſtie and myldeneſſe whyche
bothe he, and all his companye haue,
and doo vſe, withoute any blaſphemie,
without any rigour, wrong, or violence
offered to any perſone, or tranſgreſſyng
the Edict of Ianuary laſt paſte. And euen
nowe of late, vppon the breakyng
of an Image, he hathe cauſed thoſe that
ſtande charged therwith, to be putt into
the handes of Iuſtice to bee punyſſhed
oute of hande. And as concerning the
complaynte made againſte ſuche tounes
as the inhabitauntes theym ſelues
keepe and are ſeaſed and aſſured of, the
meanyng is none other thanne the ſeruice
of the Kynge and Queene, and to
lette thoſe who abuſe the authoritie of
theyr maieſtye, and compaſſe theym aboute
wyth armes, from the poſſeſſion
of them, whereby they mighte force the
ſame to ſerue theyr tournes and particular
paſſions. For as ſoone as the
ſayde ladye ſhalbee reſtored to that former
libertye whyche ſhe enioyed twoo

monthes paſte, ſhe ſhall wel vnderſtand
the ſayde tounes to remayne in the lyke
obedience and ſubiection that afore time
they haue doone, and will doo for euer:
and that they wylle geue place to none
in all this Realme in theyr fydelitie towardes
theyr Maieſties: And leaſt of
all, to them, whome they haue knowen
a long whyle ſynce to haue practiſed the
begynnyng and maintenance of this ciuile
warres, vnder the pretence of religion
euen with particular promyſe to
furniſhe money to that intent.
            As touchynge the reſte, the ſayde
Prince, and all his company, are ſo farr
frome layeng vnder foote, and kepyng
in ſylence that whyche hathe paſſed in
this matter (whyche thyng yet he hathe
beene perſuaded to dooe, and that he
ſhoulde alſo withoute anye doubte or
dreade, ſpeedyly comme to the Courte,
that rather they wylle make a memoriall
thereof for euer, and paynte it 
                  〈◊〉
               
Tables, wryte it in Letters of golde,
make it bee proclaymed and cried loude,
thorough all Chriſtendome of the dutie

and fidelytie they, to ſoo good purpoſe,
haue yealden to theyr kynge, (a Prince
layde abroade in thys hys tender age, to
all iniurie and violence) to make thereof
an examuple and a perpetuall teſtimony
of the maner, wherewith the ſayd
Prince & the nobilytie of France were ſo
readily, in ſo good numbre, and ſo with
one accorde aſſembled together, for the
ſuretie and libertie of theyr Lorde, and
for the preſeruation of his perſonne,
and eſtate. Neyther canne the ſayde
prince thynke, that hereafter there may
bee offrred vnto hym a more goodlye
and woorthye to bee thoughte on occaſion
to doo his maieſtie ſeruice, neyther
a better or worthier meane to pourchaſe
vnto him ſelfe trewe honour and praiſe.
At the leaſt he hope the to obteyne the
fauoure of God, and of his prynce, for
this faicte when he ſhall attayne to that
age, wherein he ſhall bee able to iudge,
knowe, and vnderſtande thys acte, of
trewe and faythfull affection, whych his
Subiectes haue borne hym at this
tyme.
            
               
               THESE thynges conſydered, the
ſayde Prince who hathe doone all duetie
to pacifye thys trouble, whyche ſemeth
to tende to none other end than to a manyfeſte
ruyne and ſubuerſyon of thys
ſtate: Who hathe alſo ſubmytted hymſelf
to all the reaſonable conditions that
in hym lye, to laye down al weapon as
well on the one ſyde as the other, withoute
hauynge regarde to any thyng, other
than the libertie of the Kyng and
Quene: And the cōmune ſuretie whiche
he hath good cauſe to ſeke, doth agayne
proteſt, afore the Kyng and Quene, and
all the courtes of parliament, with all
the eſtates of this Realme, that of the
miſchiefs, miſeries and deſolations that
maye hereafter come to paſſe, the faulte
thereof oughte to bee imputed to thoſe
that be the aucthors and thonely cauſe,
who haue determyned rather to trouble
all thys ſtate, by taryenge in courte, and
in the counſayle (where as yet they neither
can nor oughte remayne, neyther
be admytted) yf they woulde folow the
requeſte of the eſtates) tyll ſuche tyme

as they had ſatiſfied them) than by departynge
thence to leaue there a common
quiete and reſte.
            The ſaide prince further requireth all
the ſayde courtes of parliament, all the
tounes and communaltes of this realme
that they will diligentlye way all the aboueſayde,
and to doe al the duetye they
owe and that ſhall be poſſible vnto them
to dooe for the ſeruice of the kynge, the
ſuretye of his perſonne and ſtate, and to
maynetayne the auctoritye and rule of
the Queene: to the ende they maye hereafter
rendre ſo good a compte, and
ſufficient witneſſe of theyr dooynges in
thys preſent neceſſitie (as the ſaid prince
alſo myndeth to do of hys vnto the king
beynge comme to the age of commaundyng
by hym ſelfe) that his maieſty may
haue occaſyon rather to praiſe theym, eſteeme
them and thancke them, than to
blame theym for theyr lacke of duety, or
for the to much folowyng their paſſions
for flatering or gratyfieng any particuler
perſons, who would at this tyme rather
colour, autoriſe and make ratified

theyr fautes than looke to the conſeruation
of hys eſtate.
            Further the ſayde prince hartely beeſecheth
all the good and laufull ſubiectes
of thys croune to lende him ayde, fauour
and aſſiſtence in a cauſe ſo good
and iuſte: callyng GOD to wytneſſe,
that onelye the griefe he hathe to ſee the
Kynge and Queene ſo vnworthelye
handeled by theyr owne proper ſubiectes,
and compaſſed wyth theyr force and
armes, otherwiſe than euer before thys
tyme hath bene ſene in this realme, and
the deſire to mayntayne the honour of
God, the gouernment of the ſayde layde
together with the conſeruacion of thys
eſtate, and the more parte of the kynges
good ſubiectes, haue conſtrained hym to
ſette hym ſelfe agaynſte theyr violence.
Whiche thynge at the leaſte wayes hytherto
hath ſo preuayled that as yet they
neuer durſt execute theyr enterpriſes ſufficientlye
enough diſcouered, whyche
ſurelye woulde haue broughte her ſayde
maieſtye in ſuche extremitye and thraldome
as of longe tyme no Queene hath

bene ſeene, and the moſte parte of the
ſayde ſubiectes of the kynge in moſt pityfull
eſtate and greuous oppreſſion.
He thanketh almightye GOD greately,
that it hathe pleaſed him of his infinite
goodneſſe and prouidence
to put into his hand the meane
to reſiſt them hitherto, whiche
he truſteth and aſſureth
him ſelf he
wil geue him
the grace to
being to a
good and happy end for his ſeruice
ſake and that of bothe their
