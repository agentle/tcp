            To the right excellēt and noble baron / my lorde Montioy / lorde Chamberlayne to the quenes grace Thomas Paynel gretyng.
            
               BVt that I hitherto haue marked excellent baron / bothe by philoſophers / laweers / orators / poetis / and diuines / accuſtomably to haue ben vſed / that whan ſo euer any of them did either make worke / or tranſlate any excellent mans worke: are wont for ye defence therof / exquiſitely to choſe ſom one well lerned or noble parſone / to whome they ſhulde vowe and dedicate theyr laboure: I at this tyme

muſyng to whome I ſhulde aſcryue this my rude tranſlation / ſhulde nat before many other haue choſen your excellence. Than if I vſe an honeſt / olde / & approbate cuſtome / who wyl blame me? If I choſe an excellēt lerned man (I meane your excellence) and borne of high blud / who wyl nat approue my doynge? If I dedicate my ſmall peynes to you my eſpeciall good lorde and patrone / who can reproue me? Nor the ſmalnes of this worke ſhall nat withdrawe me to aſcriue hit to your magnificēce: for often tymes in ſmall and compēdious rules / are wount to be incloſed great wyſedome and lernynge / as ſaythe Beroaldus in theſe verſes:

                  Sunt hec parua quidem fatcor: ſed magna ſubinde
                  Eſſe ſolent paruis deteriora bonis.
                  Hoc adamas / gemine
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      docent: que corpore parno
                  Oblectant reges / diuitibus
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      placent.
                  
                     Nos contra horremus magnos perſepe gygantes.
                  Terremur magnis ſepe voluminibus.
               
            
            And of a man of my degree and fortune / what other thynge myght be offered to your excellence ſo riche / ſo high in dygnite? Statius wryteth for Rutilius Gallus / 

                  Sepe deis hos inter honores.
                  Ceſpes / et exiguo placuerunt farra ſalino.
               
            
            Farthermore if maiſter Agapetus abaſhed nat to wryte this his lyttell boke vnto ye emperour Iuſtinian / I wtout blame may dedicate ye ſame to your goodnes. I confeſſe hit a ſmall thynge / but than I ſay hit is a boke of great wyſedome and lernyng / cō
               teynynge all theſe preceptes / by the whiche nat onely a prince / but all other eſtates may lerne to do iuſtice / maye lerne howe by humanite and gentylnes to order theyr ſubiectes / ad ſeruauntes. Is this ſmalle boke

thā vnworthy to be moche made of? vnworthy to be dedicate to your excellence? vnworthy to be accepted? vnworthy often to be turned? Is it a lyght thynge for a prince / to lerne iuſtely howe to rule his people / and to tempre euery thynge by Iuſtice? Let them therfore that wyl diſpreiſe this ſmall worke bicauſe it is ſmall / but my truſt is / that your excellēce / nat conſyderynge the ſmalnes therof / but the brefe preceptis of greatte wyſedome and lernynge therin contryued: wyll nat only preyſe hit / but alſo (by goddis grace) ſtyll contynually enſewe the ſame. Thus I commende 
                  〈◊〉
                to your excellence / deſyryng your gētylnes gentylly (as ye be accuſtomed to do) to accept this my rude tranſlacion.
         
      
      
         
            
            The preceptes of Agapetus to the emperour Iuſtinian.
            
               COnſyderynge o myghty Emperour thou haſt the higheſt and honorableſte dignite of all dignites: thou ſhuldeſt honour & worſhyp hȳ aboue all other / whiche hath reputed the worthy of ſuche honour. For why / god in likenes of his celeſtiall empere / hath delyuered to the / the ſceptre and gouernaunce of this worlde / to inſtructe and teache thy ſubiectes to kepe iuſtice / and to punyſhe them / whiche perſuade the contrary / folowynge and obeyenge his lawes and his preceptis / and orderynge thy ſubiectes as right and

equite requirethe.
            ii. As the gouernour of a ſhyppe in tempeſt doth watche diligētly bothe for his owne ſauegarde and his: ſo an emperour muſte kepe ſuche diligent watche / that equite and iuſtice be in ſurete: and ſo ſtrongely repelle the vehement wawes of iniquite / that the 
                  ••
               ot of his worldly cōmonwelth be nat fruſhed and brokē with the wawes of wickednes.
            iii. Therfore we mortal men ſpecially are taught and īſtructed with holy ſcripture / to knowe our ſelfe. For who that knoweth hym ſelfe / ſhall knowe god: and he yt knoweth god / ſhall be likened to god: truly he ſhal be likened to god / that is goddis ſeruant: he is goddis ſeruāt / that doth nothyng contrary to goddis cōmandement / but that he thynketh be ꝑteynynge

to god: he ſpeketh as he thynketh / and dothe as he ſpeketh: whiche thynge no man may do effectually / with out perpetuall contynuance in goodnes.
            iiii. No man ſhulde glorifie or delite in the nobilite of his kyndrede. For why / both riche and poure be ingendred of erthe. Therfore no mā ought to exalte and prayſe his vile & erthly kyndrede / but onely glorifie and reioyce in good and godly maners.
            v. O mā loke and knowe thou / that the higher thou art by goddis helpe in dignite: ſo moche thou arte more in his dette: therfore thanke thy benefactour therof / whiche acceptethe that is due to him as merite / and for frendſhyppe doth frendſhyppe: god is always the firſt that gyueth / and yet as he were our detter / he quiteth

agayn our goodnes to hym ſhewed. onely requirynge for his gentylnes and kyndenes to vs / effectuall loue and thankes.
            vi. Truly ther is nothyng that maketh a man ſo cōmendable or preyſe worthy / as to do / that he deſyreth to do: and to wyll and do / that is good and rightous. Conſyderynge than that this power is gyuen the by almighty god / of the whiche in our be halfe thou haddeſt great nede: thou ſhalte wyll and do nothynge / but as god (that hath gyuen the ſuche faculte and power) wylleth and commaundeth. For truely nothynge is more pleaſant both to god and man / than to do iuſtice.
            7. The vnſtedfaſtnes of theſe worldly riches enſue and folowe the cours of flowyng waters / whiche ryches

he ſhall poſſeſſe & enioye but a while that thynketh hȳ ſelfe of them moſt ſure. For ſhortely after / with the fallyng water / they wyll leue hym and enriche ſome other. Therfore good and mercifull dedes be to man moſt ſure and ſtedfaſte: for the merite of them returneth euermore to the profite of the good dede doers.
            viii. Bicauſe of this high & worldly empere thou art harde to be ſpoken with all: and yet by reaſon of ſuche power thou ſhuldeſt humiliate thy ſelfe: and therfore ye ſpedilier admyt poure mē to thy ſpeche and preſence. Thou ſhalte therfore the ſooner (folowing goddis rules) liſten to poure men / that god maye in thy neceſſite bothe kyndly harken to the / and alſo helpe the. For loke howe we order other / ſo of god we ſhal be ordred.
            
               ix. The pēs;iful and troubled mynde of an emperour muſte be euermore as pure as the glas / that ſo hit may by diuine and godly lyght / continually glyſter & ſhyne: and alſo that he by quietnes of mynde may lerne diſtincte and true knowelege of thynges. For truely there is nothynge yt cauſeth man ſo wel to marke and be holde what is to be done / as a quiete mynde and clere conſcience.
            x. Lyke as the mariner / a lytell goynge out of cours / hurteth & is noyfull to thoſe that ſayle with hym: & as the ſhyppe by negligence of the gouernour peryſſheth and goeth to wracke: euen ſo do the citees. For if a ſubiecte do amys / he hurteth hym ſelfe more greuouſly than the welth publyke: but whan the ruler / the gouernour / or prince myſdoeth / he hurteth

ye holle cōmunalte: Therfore for as moche as he muſt gyue a ſtrayte counte if he rule nat well: hit were nedefull that he with exquyſite diligence both ſpeke & do euery thynge / and ſo auoyde all danger.
            xi The cercle & whele of theſe worldly thynges be often tymes turned / the whiche are turned ſomtime this way ſomtyme that way. Truely in theſe thynges is no equalite: for in them is neither conſtāce nor yet any ſure fūdaciō. Therfore o moſt mighty emperour amonge theſe changeable mouynges / and vnſtedynes of thynges / loke that thou haue a ſtedfaſte thought and mynde / with true feythe and pitie.
            xii. Thou ſhalt flie and withſtande the entycyng cōmunicacion of flatterers / as thou woldeſte eſchewe a

ſort of rauening crowes. For crowes pecke out the corporal eies: but flatterers blinde the vnderſtandynge of mans ſoule / whan they wyll nat ſuffre hym to ꝑceyue the trouthe of thȳ
               ges: for either they preyſe thynges that are worthy to be diſpreiſed / or els diſpreiſe thinges moſt worthy to be preyſed: ſo that one of theſe two muſt nedes folowe / that is / either ye commendacion and laude of yll and wicked caytyues / orels the cōtempt and diſpreyſe of good men.
            xii. An emperours mynde muſt alway be conſtant. For why / to chāge with euery wauerȳg and vnſtedfaſt thinge / is a token of an inconſtaunt minde. Therfore thou ſhuldeſt cleue and affixe thy ſelfe to good and vertuous men / whiche ſhall ſtabliſhe & make ſtedfaſte thy kyngdome & empere.

Nor thou ſhuldeſt nat proudly eleuate thy ſelfe / nor yet without reſon to moche ſubmytte thy ſelfe: but prudently after the vſe and cuſtome of wiſe men / ſurely to groūde the inconſtance. For who ſo euer grondely thynkethe vpon the diſceitfulnes of this lyfe: and wyll alſo beholde the vilenes and ſhortnes therof: conſyderynge farthermore the bodily fylthines / he wyll neuer waxe proude / be he in neuer ſo high a dignite.
            xiiii. Aboue all other precious ornamentis that any kyngdome hath / ye crowne of pite and of diuyne ſeruice dothe moſt hight and ornate a kyngis and an emperours maieſte. For why / erthely richeſſe / fauour of the cōmunalte / laude & preyſe do ſoone vaniſhe away / but the glorie of good and vertuous life / is immortall / and

ſhall neuer be forgotte.
            xv. Me thynketh hit moche vnconuenient / that the poore man and the riche ſhulde ſuffre like harme by cō
               trarye and dyuers cauſes: the riche by abundance and great welfare are corrupted: ye poure periſhe through famyne and ſcarſite. Farther more the riche poſſeſſeth al the worlde / the poure man hath nat where he maye ſet his foote. Therfore / to the entent that they bothe may be holpe / they muſt be ruled by deduction / that is / the riche muſte gyue to the poure: & ſo the inequalite ſhall be brought to equalite.
            xvi. The tyme and ſeaſon of proſperous life / whiche certeyne olde prophettis dyd ꝓnoſticate ſhulde come / whan wyſe men ſhulde gouerne and rule / or kynges waxe philoſophers / 

is nowe manifeſted and opened: for truely you gyuynge nowe and appliyng your ſelfe to philoſophie & wyſedome / are eſtemed worthy to be rulers: but ſpecially whan in your auctorite and gouerning / ye decline nat frō reaſon & wyſedome. For if to loue wiſedome maketh the philoſopher / and the begynnyng of wiſedome is the fere of god / whiche ye muſt euer more remēbre: who can ſay / but my writing is true / & as clere as true?
            xvii. For certeyne we affirme the to be an emperour / ſeinge thou wylt ouercome & ſubdue thy voluptuous pleaſures. and than thou arte crowned with the 
                  •••
               deme of Chaſtite / & thā thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe arayed wt the 
                  •
               urpul robe of Iuſtice. As for al other thinges vaniſhe away: theſe vertues be immortall: al other pleaſures

and worldly dignites peryſhe: but as theſe vertues be fer frō al perell / ſo they be euerlaſtyng.
            xviii. If thou wylt be beloued & honored of all men / loke thou helpe all men. For certeynly ther is nothyng that cauſeth a mā to be beloued and honored ſo ſoone / as to helpe and ſuccour poure mē: for ye capping & knelyng that is done for feare / is fucate & figured flattery of feyned honour.
            xix. Thy empere by all right & reaſon is therfore the more worthy to be honored and preyſed / that it feareth and kepeth his ēnemies vnder: and ſhewing to his ſubiectis al kyndnes kepeth them in good ꝓſperite. Therfore as it ouercometh his ēnmies by ſtrengthe of armes / ſo his ſubiectes by charite and good loue ſurmoūt & ouercome his gentylnes & goodnes:

truly betwene theſe .ii. kyndes of humanite & loue is no more difference / than is betwene the tame ſhepe and other wylde beaſtis.
            xx. Though an emperour ī body be like all other / yet in power he is lyke god / & maiſter of al men. For in erthe he hath no pere. Therfore as god be thou neuer chafed or angry / as man be thou neuer proude. For though yu be like god ī face / yet for al that thou art but erthe: whiche thing techeth the to be egall to euery man.
            xxi. Accept and fauour them ye gyue the good coūſaile / but nat thoſe that flatter the: good coūſeilers conſyder what ought to be done: flatterers cō
               ſyder what may pleaſe mē of might: whiche flatterers are like mens ſhadowes: for they gayneſay nothyng / but alowe & preiſe what euer is ſaid.
            
               xxii. Be ſo to thyne / as thou woldeſt that god ſhulde be to the. For as we here other / ſo we ſhall be harde / & as we fauour other / ſo god wyll fauour vs. Therfore let vs fyrſt ſhewe mercy and be mercifull / that in lyke maner we may opteyne mercy.
            xxiii. As a fayre glaſſe expreſſeth the very true fiſnomy of man / that is of goodly & beutifull ꝑſons theyr beutifulnes: and of yll fauored theyr yl fauour: ſo the rightouſnes & equite of god is likened to our dedes. For after our dedes / god wyll rewarde vs.
            xxiiii. Do that y•e entende coldly / but yet do hit ſpedily yt ye purpoſe to do. For foliſhe haſtynes in euery thinge is very perillous. Truly who yt marketh diligentely / what miſchiefe ryſeth of haſtynes / ſhal ſoone ꝑceyue & like wiſe vnderſtāde the cōmodite of

good coūſeile / as ſicke folke aft theyr ſickenes vnderſtande the pleaſure of helthe. Therfore moſt prudēt prince with ſage coūſeile and deuoute prayers made to god / loke thou diligently ſerche and inquere what ſhalbe ꝓfitable for the / to rule and gouerne this worlde.
            xxv. Thou ſhalt beſt gouerne thy noble empere / if thou ouerſe al thinges thy ſelfe / & ſuffre nothing negligētly to paſſe. Nor it is nat a ſmall thinge in the / that in cōpariſon of thy ſubiectes appereth to be ſmalle. For the leeſt worde of an emperour / is amōg all folkes right highly eſtemed / and of great auctorite.
            xxvi. Bicauſe ther is no erthly man that can cōſtraine the to obſerue and kepe thy lawes / enforce thy ſelfe to vſe & kepe them. For if thou diligētly

obſerue them / thou ſhalt manifeſtly ſhewe / that the lawe is worthy to be obſerued / and the breker of hit / worthy to be punyſhed.
            xxvii. It is one thinge to ſyn / & nat to chaſtiſe ſynners. For who ſo euer dwelleth in a cite / & ther in ſuffreth wicked liuers / before god he is an yl lyuer. Therfore if thou wylt be eſtemed to be indifferent / honor them yt do well / & punyſhe them that do yll.
            xxviii. I thynke hit very expediēt to eſchewe yl company. For who yt is cō
               uerſant with yll lyuers / ſhall eyther ſuffre harme / or lerne ſome yll. But he that leadeth his lyfe amōge good & honeſt cōpany / eyther he ſhal lerne to folowe honeſtie / orels to diminiſhe his fautes and vices.
            xxix. Sith it is ſo yt god hath gyuen to the rule of al the worlde / loke yu vſe

no yl officers. For he that promoteth them ſhal anſwere for theyr offēces. Therfore great offices muſt be deligētly gyuē / & wel & wiſely beſtowed.
            30. I eſteme theſe two thinges to be lyke yll / to be chafed with ye leude deling of our ēnemie / or to be mollified with the pleſant ſwete wordis of our frēdes. For we ought to reſiſt & with ſtande them bothe / that is / neuer to decline frō comelines / nother in reuē
               gyng the vnreſonable yll wyll of our foos / nor in rewarding the feyned beniuolence of our frende and louer.
            31. Eſteme nat thoſe thy feythful frē
               des / that wyl preyſe al thinges that thou ſpekeſt: but thoſe / whiche with out any feyning / do all that they can for the: and be glad & reioyce / whan thou ſayeſt or doſt any thynge well / & agayne be ſory & heuy / if thou do or

ſay yll. For certayne theſe betokens of frendſhip aborryng all fraude.
            32. Let nat the greatnes & might of this thy erthly empere chāge thy noble mynde / but ruling thy frayle empere / and ſubiect to diuers fortunes / haue amōge theſe mutable thinges a ſtedfaſt and īmutable mynde / nat lyfting vp thy ſelfe by to moche ioy / nor yet hurtȳg thy ſelfe by to moche heuynes & ſorowe. For lyke as golde though it by crafte & wytte of mā be turned nowe thus nowe other wiſe / & wrought in diuers faſhions of ornamentes: yet hit remayneth golde ſtyl nor wyl nat be chāged from his nature: ſo thy ſelfe moſt noble emperour / though frō grice to grice haſte borne one office after an other / & arte come to the moſt higheſt honor / yet thou remayneſt ye ſame thinge thou

were. Kepe yu therfore amonge theſe diuerſites of thinges an inalterable and a cōſtant mynde / the whiche frō this worldly empere / ſhal bringe the to ꝑpetuall blys & ioye euerlaſtinge.
            33. If thou wylt haue ye dominiō of thy empere cōmended / deme thyne owne offences as worthy punyſſhemēt as ye defautes of thy ſubiectis. For in this worlde no man / but only thyn owne conſciēce can puniſhe the.
            34. He that opteyneth high power and dignite ſhulde enſue & folowe as nere as he may / ye gyuer therof. For if themperour repreſent god / lorde of al thinge / and by his liberalite hath the gouernance of euery thinge: he than (but namely ī this poynt) ſhall folow hym / & eſteme no erthly thȳg ſo precious / or ſo moche of man to be deſired / as to be mylde & mercifull.
            
               35. Aboue golde and precious ſtone we ſhuld lay vp as treaſure ye riches of well doing. For they in this p̄ſent lyfe / through hope of the fruicion to come wyll delite vs: and in ye lyfe to come / by experience and taſt of euerlaſting ioy / they ſhalbe to vs ſwete & pleaſant. Theſe worldly thinges / ye ſeme to vs pleaſant / ſhuld be eſchewed and vtterly auoyded / as vnmete / and nothing ꝑteyninge to vs / yt they by enticement diſceyue vs nat.
            36. Loke thou quite them with gay rewardes / whiche with good wyl do thy cōmandemētes. For by ye meane thou ſhalt encreace ye corage of good men / and teache ye yldoers to lament theyr offences. For it were to moche vniuſte deling to reward alike aſwel them ye deſerued nat as deſerued it.
            37. Than truly the empere excedeth

all other thinges / whan ye ruler therof enclyneth nat to vndiſcrete cruelnes / but to amiable equite & iuſtice / fleynge beaſtly cruelnes / and enſuyng godly kyndnes.
            38. Aſwel thou ſhalt iuge rightfully thy ēnemy as thy frēde / nat fauorȳg thy frēde for frendſhyp / nor hurtyng thy ēnemy for hatred. For it is a like incōueniēce and offence / to helpe thy frēde deſiryng that is agaynſt eqte / as it is to hurte thy ēnemy demaunding iuſtice: ye miſdede in both caſes is like / though ye ꝑſones be dyuers.
            39. Iuges muſt diligently harken to their cauſes. For hit is a very harde thinge breuely to ꝑceyue ye trouthe / the whiche frō negligēt ꝑſons ſoone ſkapeth. But if a rightful iuge wyll leaue the feyned eloquence of attourneis / and cōſidering the true entēciō
               
wyl flie ye likelyhod of cauſes / he ſhal ſhortly ꝑceyue ye trouth. And farthermore auoyde .ii. diuers fautes / that is / they ſhal neither do / nor yet ꝑmit any other to do agaynſt honeſtie.
            xl. Though thou haue as many vertues / as be ſterris ī ye firmamēt / yet thou ſhalt neuer ouercome the goodnes of god. For what ſo euer we offer to god / we offer to hȳ but his owne. And as no mā can go fro or before hiſ ſhadowe in ye ſon / alway going afore or nere folowing hym: ſo ye goodnes of god is inſuperable / and can nat be exceded wt good warkes of any man.
            xli. The treaſure of liberalite is infinite. For who that liberally ſpēdeth getteth / and ſpending his goodes other gether them. Loke than moſt liberal emperour: yt thou mynde thoſe thinges: and that thou gyue largely

to poure men. For whan the tyme of rewardes and thākes ſhall come / thā for this thy liberalite / thou ſhalt haue infinite thankes & great luker.
            xlii. Seing thou haſte opteyned and gotten thy kyngdome by god / folow thou hym in all good warkes / that men may knowe thy liberalite. For thou art of the numbre of them that may do good / & nat of poure mē and thoſe that couet to be holpē. For god therfore hath gyuen the ſo abundāt riches to helpe & ſuccour poure men.
            xliii. An emperour is no otherwiſe ordeyned to rule the worlde / thā mans eies to rule and watche for the ſauegarde of his body. He is deputed of god to miniſtre thoſe thynges / that may be profitable for mā. Therfore an emperour ought to do none otherwiſe for al men / than he wolde do for

hym ſelfe: that ſo by his tuiciō they may auoyde al dangers / and ꝓſpere in goodnes.
            xliiii. Thynke thou the moſt ſure defence of thy ꝓſperite / to hurte nor to iniury no man. For he that offēdeth no man / ſuſpecteth no man. If than to iniury no mā dothe cauſe good cuſtody and ſauegarde: then truely by liberalite thou ſhalt ye ſoner opteyne hit. For as liberalite getteth and engēdreth defence: ſo it cōſerueth good and honeſt loue. For if we do that is honeſt / men wyl loue and kepe vs.
            xlv. Be thou (o moſte mekeſt emperoure) to thy ſubiectes through thy excellent power / terrible: and by thy liberalite and goodnes be thou amiable. Nor yu ſhuldeſt nat by to moche fauour / ſet at light and nothynge regard thy high power: nor yet regarding

to moche thy power / deſpiſe fauour. But kepȳg a mean / thou ſhalt as well ſhewe louely kyndnes to thy ſubiectes / as by aſperite & ſharpnes chaſtiſe to great familiarite.
            xlvi. Suche thinges as yu by worde doſt p̄ſcribe to thy ſubiectes / loke by example of pure life thou accōpliſhe. For if thou do reaſon / and with reaſon doſte lyue as thou ſayeſt / euery man ſhall greatly cōmende the.
            xlvii. Loue them moſte noble emperour / that mekely deſyre thy gyftes / more than thoſe / whiche diligētly deſire to gyue ye gyftes. For theſe thou art boūde to thāke / & alſo to rewarde them: the other truly ſhal aſſine god to thāke ye / whiche reputeth to be gyuen to hym / & for his loue / what ſo euer is gyuen or done for poure men.
            xlviii. The vertue of the ſon is to illuluminate

the worlde / themperours vertue is to be mercyfull / & to helpe poure men. Truly a meke & a merciful prince excedeth ye brightnes of ye ſon: for ye ſon gyueth place to ye night but a good vertuous prince ſuffreth no extorciō / but by ye light of trouthe and iuſtice / he caſtiſeth iniquite.
            xlix. Thy predeceſſours haue gretly ornated theyr empere / but thou truly by thy humanite & affabilite / nat eſteming thy ryal & mighty power / haſt moche more greatly ornated it. Wherfore al they yt nede mercy rūne to thy grace / whiche delyuered from theyr pouerte & aduerſite / do highly thanke the.
            l. Loke how moche thou excelleſt al other in power & dignite / ſo moche ye more yu ſhuldſt endeuer the / by noble & vertuous dedes to excelle & ſhyne

aboue all other. For high power reqreth great honeſtie. God alſo wyl require / thou helpe (after thy power) nedefull and honeſt ꝑſons. Therfore if yu deſire to be truly preyſed / & to be by god / as it were bi a trōpeter declared a cōqueror: ioyne yu to ye crowne of thy inuincible ēpere / by helping ye poure) ye crowne of euerlaſting ioye.
            li. Er thou cōmande that right and equite ꝑſuadeth / loke thou wel vpon it. For verily ſo thou ſhalt euermore cōmande that right is. Mans tōge is a very ſlippery inſtrumēt / ye whiche hath brought many one ī to gret perill & danger. Therfore if yu prefixe to the forſaid inſtrumēt yt is goodly & honeſt / hit ſhall ſoūde only yt is pleaſant / & right to be executed & done.
            lii. A prince ī al thinges muſt be ſubtile & wiſe / but namely in iuginge of

great & weighty cauſes / ſeldome angry / and nat to be angry without a great cauſe. But bicauſe neuer to be angry is nat laudable / an emperour to refrayne the furiouſnes of miſdoers / and yt men may purge theyr fautes / ſhall meaſurably vſe his anger.
            liii. Loke yu be diligēt to knowe ꝑfetly the maners & cōdicions of thy ſeruā
               tes / & of all thoſe / whiche charite enforceth the to loue. And alſo be yu diligent to knowe thoſe / whiche diſceitfully do flatt ye. For oft tymes diſceitful louers & flaterers do great hurt.
            liiii. Whan ſo euer thou hereſt ſuche cōmunicacion or coūſaile / ye may profite / do nat only here hit / but alſo folowe it. For truly ye emperours maieſte is than ornated / whan he hym ſelfe cōſidereth / what is neceſſary to be done: and deſpiſeth nat other mēs

profitable inuecions & coūſayle / and is nat aſhamed to lerne / and quickely executeth that he hath lerned.
            lv. As a caſtell / whiche by reaſon of his ſtrōge walles is inuincible / and ſetteth light by his ēnemies: ſo thy empere / wel walled with liberalite & fortified with deuoute prayer / is inuīcible / and by goddis helpe ſhal triumphe of his aduerſares & ēnemes.
            lvi. Vſe ſo this inferior kyngdome / that it may be to ye a way to ye kyngdome of heuen. For who ſo euer gouerneth well this erthly kingdome / is eſtemed worthy to opteyne celeſtial ioye and pleaſure. He ruletth this worlde rightfully / that charitably loueth his ſubiectes / and of his ſubiectes is duely honored & dredde / and whā he procureth / that none occaſiō of yll be amonge them.
            
               lvii. Liberalite & charitable dedes is a ꝑpetual & incorrupt garmēt. Therfore who ſo euer wyl raygne charitably / muſt ornate and clothe his ſoule with ſuche goodly veſture and apparaile. For who that helpeth ye poure men / ſhal opteyne ioye euerlaſtinge.
            lviii. Cōſidring that god hath gyuen the / ye imperial ſceptre / loke thou endeuer thy ſelfe vtterly to pleaſe him. And bicauſe he hath preferd ye aboue al other: thou muſt honor him aboue al other. Truly god eſtemeth hit the moſt ſingularſt benefite yt thou canſt do hym / to defende his creatures as thy ſelfe / and liberally to helpe them as bounde therto.
            lix. Euery man yt deſireth his helthe muſt call vpon god / but ſpecially the emperour / whiche laboureth for the welth of al men. And he defended by

god / ſhal as well ouercome his ennemies as defende his ſubiectes.
            lx. God nedeth nothing. An emperor hath onely nede of god. Therfore folow him yt hath no nede / & ſhew mercy abūdātly to them yt aſke it. nat rekening ſtraitly thy expēſes of houſe hold: but rather helpe euery mā yt deſireth to liue. For it is better to helpe ye vnworthi for honeſt mēs ſakis thā for ye vice of ye vnworthy to defraude the worthy of that they deſerued.
            lxi. As yu woldeſt haue forgyuenes of thy ſynnes / ſo forgyue other yt the offēde. God forgyueth them yt forgiue. & where forgiuenes is / there is god.
            lxii. A prince yt wold demene hȳ fautleſly / muſt diligētly take hede / yt his peple be vtuous / & yt he be aſhamed to ſyn / & yt he giue no opē exāple to other to do am
                  •
               s / & yt he abſteyne priuatly

leſt he offēd opēly. For if ſubiectis be aſhamed to do amys / moche more yeir ruler ought to be aſhamed.
            lxiii. It is a priuat mās vice to do yll & liue viciouſly / but a prīce to forget his owne welth & honeſtie is moche more vicious. For ye abſtinēce frō yll dothe nat iuſtifie mā / but ye doyng of honeſtie & goodnes. Therfore no mā ſhulde only abſteyne frō yll / but alſo endeuer him to do iuſtice.
            lxiiii. Deth dredeth neither kyng nor emperor / but egally deuoureth euery mā. Therfore before his fearefull comyng / let vs gether our riches in heuē. For no mā can cary worldly ryches thither / but all left in ertthe / he ſhal ther naked giue acōpt of his life
            lxv. As an ēperor is lorde of al mē / ſo wt all other he is goddis ſeruāt. And ſhall thā be called a lorde / whā he by

               vtue of chaſtite ouercometh his ſenſual luſtis / & with an inuīcible mȳde deſpiſeth the tranſitory pleaſures & ioyes of this worlde.
            lxviii. As mās ſhadow foloweth the body / ſo ſyn foloweth ye ſoule: whiche ſoule ones ſeperated frō ye mortal body / ſhal giue arekening to god of his good & yl dedes. Nor thā is no tyme to deny any thyng. For euery mans dede ſhal beare witnes / nat bi worde but repreſentinge & openinge euery mans dede / as he dyd hit.
            lxix. As a ſhyp hauing winde at wyl brīgeth ye paſſagers oft times into ye hauē ſoner thā they wold a thought ſo ye ſwift time of this mortal life paſſeth away / & we aproche to our ende: Therfore let vs leue to loue worldly thīges / whiche this world eſtemeth ſo moche / & let vs ſtudi how to get to

ye port of heuē / where is no wayling / but eternal ioye and pleaſure.
            lxx. No man bi reaſon of his dignite ſhuld be haute & proude / but cōſidering ye ſubſtāce of ye fleſhe / ſhulde repreſſe the ſwelling pride of hart. For though he be made a prince ī erthe / yet he muſt mȳde / he was engēdred of erthe: & yt frō erthe he aſēded to ye ſeate royal / & frō ye ſeate roial he ſhal agayne deſcēde to vilē erth & aſhes.
            lxxi. Be neuer careles prince moſt excellēt. & as they yt go vp a ladder ſtint nat til they come to ye higheſt rōge or grice: ſo yu deſiring to haue vtu / ſhul deſt neuer ceſſe tyl yu cōe to ye kingdōe of heuē. Whiche thing Chriſte / ye keper and encrecer of all thing (whoſe name mē ſhall glorifie & preiſe etnally) grant the & ye empreſſe thy wife.
