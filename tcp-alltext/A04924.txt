AndLeui. 10. in witnes therof Nadab & Abihu offeringe ſtraunge fyre, whereof God hadde geuen vnto them no charge, were inſtantly as they offered puniſhed to death by fyre. Strange fyre, which they offered vnto God, was a common fyre, & not of that fyre whiche God had commaunded to burne daye and night vpon the aulter of burnt ſacrifice, which onely ought to haue ben offered vnto God.
               O biſhoppes, ye ſhoulde haue kepte thys fyre, at morne and at euen oughte ye to haue layed faggottes therupō, your ſelfs oughte to haue clenged & carryed awaye the aſſhes: but God ſhal be holde.
               
                  In the puniſhment of theſe two aforeſayd, is to be obſerued, that Nadab and Abihu were the principall prieſtes next to Aarō their father, and that they were cōprehended, neither in aduoutry, couetonſnes, nor deſyre of worldly honour, but of a good zeale & ſimple entent were making ſacrifice, deſyring no profite of the people therby, but to honour God & to mitigate his wrath. And yet in ye doyng of this ſelf ſame acte & ſacrifice were they conſumed away with fyre. Wherof it is plain that neither the preemmence of yt perſon or man, that maketh or ſetteth vp any religion, withoute the expreſſe commaundement of God, nor yet the 
                     〈◊〉
                  , wherof he doeth the ſame, is accepted before God. For nothinge in his religion will he admit without his own word: but all that is added thereto doth

he abhorre, and puniſheth the inuentors and doers thereof, as ye haue heard in Nadab and Abihu, by Gedeon and diuers other Iſraelites, ſetting vp ſome thinge to honor God, whereof they had no expreſſe commaundement.
               4. A ſtory, whiche is recited in the popes cronicles, will I recite, whiche differeth nothinge frome this puniſhment of Nadab &c. Gregorius magnus in the time of the moſte contagious peſtilence, wherewith God puniſhed the iniquitie of Rome (for nowe was y• wicked horne, that Antichriſt, ſpronge vp, and ſet in authoritie) in this tyme, I ſaye, Gregory the pope deuiſed a new honpringe of God, the inuocation of ſainctes, called the Latinie. Wherof in the ſcriptures neither is there authoritie nor commaundement: vppon whiche ſacrilege and Idolatrye

God declared his wrath, euen as he did vpon Nadab and Abihu. For in the inſtante houre, when firſt this

                  etanye was recyted in open proceſſion (as they call it) foure ſcore of the principal men, that recyted the ſame, horriblye were ſtriken by ye plague of God, to death all in an houre. The papiſtes attribute this to the contagious ayre and vehemency of the plague. But it was none other thinge but a manifeſt declaration of goddes wrathe, for inuentinge and bringinge in into the churche a falſe and diabolicall religion. For whyle we deſyre ſainctes too make interceſſion and to pray for vs, what other thinge do werthen e

This is the continuall cryeng of the papiſtes: the church, the church hath al power, it can not erre, for Chriſte ſayeth: I will be with you to the ende of the world: whereſoeuer is two or thre gadered in my name, ther am I in y• myddes of them. Of thys falſely conclude they, the churche maye do all that ſemeth good for the glory of God, & whatſoeuer the churche doeth, that accepteth and approueth God.

                  tils eſtemed it to be no ſyn, yet is it expreſly forbidden in goddes lawe. But it foloweth frō thinges offerred vnto Idols, from ſtrangeled and from bloudde, ſhall ye abſteyn. If the cauſes mouing the apoſtles to forbid theſe thinges be well conſidered: it ſhalbe foūd that they hadde the expreſſe commaundement of Ieſus Chriſte ſo to do,
               
                  The ſprete of trueth & knowlege, workinge in the apoſtles with all abundance, ſhewed vnto them y• nothinge was more profitable & more mighte auaunce the glory of God, and encreace the churche of Chriſte, than that the Iewes and gentils ſhoulde vſe together in familiaritie and dayly conuerſatiō, that by mutuall companye loue might encreace. One thinge was eaſy to be eſpied, that the Iewes coulde not haſtely be perſwaded, that the eating of meates forbidden in Moyſes lawe was no ſyn before God. For difficill it is to pull forth of the hart that, whiche is planted by goddes own word, So that the Iewes wolde haue abhorred the company of the gentils, i

And therfore commaunded they the gentils too abſteyn for a tyme. For that it was not a perpetuall precept, declareth this day, when no man holdeth eatinge of ſuche thinges ſynne. But what precept had they ſo to do? The laſt and new precept geuen by Ieſus Chriſt to hys diſciples: that euery one loue other as he hathe loued vs. May not Chriſtiā loue commaunde that none of vs do in the ſight of other, that which may offende or trouble the conſcience of the infirme and weake? So witneſſeth Paule, affirming that if a man eate with offence, he ſynneth. And by vertue of this ſame

precepte the apoſtles forbid that the gentils ſhall eate thinges offerred vnto Idols &c: that bearig ſome parte with the infirmitie of the Iewes, they might grow together in mutuall amitie & Chriſtiā loue. And theſe are the traditions of the▪ Seniours, whiche Paule commaunded to be obſerued. I praye you what ſimilitude haue oure papiſticall lawes with thys precept of the apoſtles?

               Bringe your ſelfes to mynde, and be aſhamed of youre vanitie.

For all men whoſe eyes Sathan hath not blynded, may eſpye that neither wyſedome nor authoritie of man may change or ſet vp any thinge in y• religion of God, without his owne expreſſe commandement and woorde. And thus I thinke the firſt parte of my argument ſufficiently proued: whiche is that all worſhipping, honoring or ſeruice of God inuented by the brayne of man, in the religion of God withoute his owne expreſſe commaundement, is Idolatry.

To adde vnto them, and to dyminiſhe frō them? had it not ben conuenient, that after they hadde introduced Ieſus Chriſte ſpeakinge, that his owne wordes had ben recyted, nothing interchaunged, added nor dimyniſhed: Whiche ſeinge they haue not done, but haue done ye expreſſe contrary, as before is proued: In vayne I thinke it is further to laboure to proue the reſte of thys abominable action, to be inuented and deuiſed by the fooliſh brayne

of man, and ſo can it not be denied to be Idolatry. It ſhall not profit them to ſaye the Epiſtle ſi Euangely is in the maſſe: where unto is nothing added. What ſhall they proue therby? For the Epiſtle & Euangely, as them ſelfes do confeſſe are not of the ſubſtance of y• maſſe. And although they were, it dyd nothinge excuſe the reſt of that Idolatrye. For the deuil may ſpeake ye wordes of God and hys falſe prophetes alſo: & yet therby are they neither better nor more holy.

Who brought meat offringes vnto me, doeth offer ſwynes bloud. Theſe two beaſtes, the dogge & ſwyne, were abominable to be offered in ſacrifice, the one for the cruelty, the other for fylthines. But o prieſtes, your ſacrifices are mixed wt the bloudde of dogges & ſwyne: while that on the one part moſte cruelly ye do perſecute the profeſſors of Chriſtes worde: vpon the other parte your ſelfs lyue moſte filthily.

prayſeth the thinge that is vayne.Amos. 5. Amos. I hate and deteſt your ſolemne feaſtes, I will not accepte youre encenſe: your burnt offringes and meate offeringes are not thankefull before me. And whye all this: becauſe ſaieth ye prophete Eſaye, they haue choſen theſe inEſai. 66. their owne wayes, and their hartes haue delyted in their abominations. And playn it is that theirfore ſayd ſacrifices were commaū
                  ded to be done by God▪ and were not inuented, no not one iote therof, by mans wyſedom. Reade the bokes of Moyſes, Exodus & Leuiticus, and thou ſhalte perceyue them to be very commaundementes of God, and yet ſayeth y• Prophete, they haue choſen theym in their owne wayes. Wherby ye prophet ment and vnderſtode, yt they had added vnto them an opinion, whiche made them to be abominable

before God. This opiniō was as in the ſame prophet and diuers others maye be eſpied: That by workinge of the externall worke, they mighte purchaſe the fauoure of God, & make ſatiſfaction for their ſinnes bi the ſame ſacrifices. And that I collecte of Ieremye ſayeng: ye beleue falſe woordes,Iere. 7. whiche ſhall not profit you. For when ye haue ſtolen, murthered, committed adultery, and periury &c. Then ye come and ſtād before me in this hous, whiche hath my name geuen vnto it, and ye ſay: we are deliuered or abſolued, albeit we haue done all theſe abominations. Thei thought and verely beleued their ſynnes to haue ben remitted by vertue of their ſacrifice offered. But Eſay aſketh ofEſay. 55. them, why ſpēd ye ſiluer for that, which is not ſure: & cōſume labor, for that, which doeth not ſacyat?

Ye do hyde youre ſelfe with leaſinges (but they eſtemed them to haue ben verites) & ye make a bād or couenāt with death, but it ſhall not ſtāde, for when deſtructiō cō
                  meth, it ſhall ouerwhelme you. Their fals prophetes had taughtEſai. 18. them to cry peace peace, when yet there was no peace in their conſcience: for they which dyd eate ye ſynne of the people (as oure peruers prieſtes haue long done) forOſe. 7. Iere. 2. the more wicked men were, the more deſyre they had of ye maſſe: thinking by vertue therof all was purged. The peſtilent prieſtes of Moyſes law, as witneſſed ye prophetes, cauſed ye people to beleue, that by oblation of the ſacrifice they were iuſt and innocente, and durſt deſyre, for ſuche offerings, plague and the furor of God to be remoued. But it is aunſwered vnto them by y• prophet Micheas:

ſhall I come in his preſence with burnt offeringes, and yeare olde 
                     •

Or ye frute of my wōbe a ſynne offeringe for my ſoule? Here the prophete plainly witneſſeth that no externall worke, how excellēt that euer it be, doth purge or make ſatiſfaction for ſyn. And ſo of the precedentes it is playn, that a wicked opinion, added too the very worke, ſacrifice or ceremony, commaunded to be done & vſed by God, maketh it abomination and Idolatry. For IdolatryNota. is not onely too worſhip ye thinge, whiche is not God, but alſo too truſte or leane vnto that thing, whiche is not God, and hath not in hytſelfe all ſufficiencye: and therfore Paule calleth couetouſe

So yt remiſſion of ſynnes vndoubtedlye was beleued by that ſame action and worke, preſentlye done by the prieſt. Sufficient it were for me, by the playn woordes of the foreſaid prophetes here for to cōclude it abominatiō: ſeing they playnly ſhew y• remiſſiō of ſynnes cōmeth

Than demaunde I, if a man can offre vnto God a more precious thing than hym ſelf? And it appeareth that not.
               
                  For Paule commaundeth that we offre vnto God a holy, liuely and reaſonable ſacrifice, which he calleth oure owne bodyes. And Ieſus Chriſt, hauing nothinge more preciouſe then hym ſelf, dyd offer vp hym ſelf.

Heare ye papiſtes, two witnes ſpeake agaynſte you. How can ye denye the opinion of your maſſe to be fals and vayn?

               The apoſtle by comparing Ieſus Chriſte to the Leuitical prieſtes, and hys ſacrifice vnto theirs maketh the matter playne, that Chriſt might be offered but once. Fyrſt the Leuitical prieſtes were mortall, and therefore it behoued them to haue ſucceſſours.
               But Chriſte is an eternall prieſt, and therefore is alone,

and nedeth no ſucceſſour. The Leuiticall prieſtes offered the bloud of beaſtes: but Ieſus Chriſte offered hys owne body and bloud. The Leuiticall prieſtes, for impotency of their ſacrifice, did iterate the ſame. But the ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſte, hauinge in itſelfe all perfecti

               The text ſayeth playnly as beforeAunſwere▪
                   is ſhewed, that Chriſte onely might offerre hym ſelf: which ſacrifice is ſufficiēt, & neuer may be offered agayn. For if it had behoued hym to haue ben oftener offered then once, he ſhoulde haue ſuffered often tymes, from the beginninge of the world. But once hathHeb. 9. he appeared for the away takinge of ſynne, offering hym ſelf. ThatHebr. 10. is, of hys own body once ſlayne, now lyuing, and may ſuffre death no more. For by hys onely one ſacrifice hath he made vs perfyte &

ſanctifyed for euer. Here is aunſwered to that obiectiō, that ſome obiecte: Men euery day fyn, therfore it is neceſſary, that euery day be ſacrifice made for ſynne. PaulNota. ſayeth by one ſacrifice hath he cō
                  ſūmat vs for euer. For other wais hys death were not the onely and ſufficient ſacrifice for our ſynnes: which to affirme, were blaſphemation.
               And ſo there reſteth of oure hole redemption nothing but his ſecond cūming, whiche ſhalbe to iudgemēt. Where we, depending vppon hym, ſhall receyue glorye and honour: but hys ennemyes ſhalbe made a footeſtoole too hys fete. Not that I meane, that hys death oughte not to be preached, and the remembraunce therof extolled, and prayſed in the right miniſtration of his ſupper:

but none of theſe two be ſacrifice for ſynne.
               What wil ye aunſwere to this,Queſtion. whiche Paul produceth againſt youre maſſe? He plainly ſayeth, there is no ſacrifice for ſynne, but Chriſtes death onelye &c. And that neither may ye offer him, norPapiſtes aduerte. Euaſion. yet that he maye offer hym ſelfe any more.
               Ye will ſaye it is a memoriall ſacrifice, vnder the whiche Ieſus Chriſte is offered vntoo the preſence of God the father by thee churche, vnder the apperaunce of breadde and wyne for remiſſion of ſynnes.
               I aunſwere with Paule: Apparet nunc in conſpectu Dei pro nobis, he appeareth nowe in the preſence of God for vs: ſo that it is not requiſyte that anye manne offerre or repreſente hym too the father.
               
                  For that he doeth hym ſelfe, makyng continual interceſſiō for vs. But let vs conſider this doctrine more depely. The church, ſay thei, offered Ieſus Chriſt vnto God y• father for a memoriall ſacrifice, or in a memoriall ſacrifice. Is there any obliuiō or forgetfulnes fallen in God the father? Hath he forgotten the death and paſſiō of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo that he nedeth to be brought in memory thereof, by any mortall man: Beholde brethern, howe that imp

Here God ſaieth ye, as none mai moue his wrath againſt his choſē (& here of ought ye to reioyce brethren, the Pope nor hys prieſtes, nor biſhoppes, what ſoeuer may not cauſe God to be angry agaynſt you, albeit they curſe you, with croſſe, belle and candel) ſo maye no man compelle hym too loue nor receyue in fauoure, but whome it pleaſeth hys infynyte goodnes. Moyſes, I confeſſe, prayed for the people, when God was diſpleaſed with them. But he ſpeaketh not ſo proudly as you do. But either deſyreth God to remit ye offence of ye people, or els to deſtroi him to gether Wt thē, I fear yt your loue be not ſo feruēt, he obteyned his petition of God. But wil ye ſay ſo it was determinate before in the counſayll of God? Aduyſe you well. The nature of God is to be fre & thrall vnto nothinge.

For although he is boūd & obliged to fulfill all yt his worde promitteth to ye faithful beleuers, yet is yt neither ſubiectiō nor thral dome: for frelye he made his promis, & frely he doeth fulfill the ſame. I deſyre to be certified, where God made his promiſſe vntoo you papiſte prieſtes: that ye ſhould haue power to appli (as ye ſpeake) the merites of Chriſtes paſſion, to all & ſondry, who tolde or nūbred money to you for yt purpoſe. Taketh God any part of the profitte that ye receyue? Alas, I haue cōpaſſion vpō your vanitie: but more vpon ye ſymple people, yt hath ben deceyued by you & your fals doctrine. Are ye better heard with god then Samuel was? He prayed for kyng Saule, and that moſte feruētly, & yet obteined not his petitiō, nor mighte not applye any merites or holines vnto him.
               
                  And it is ſayde to Ieremy, pray thou not for this people, for my hart is not to wardes it: ne though Moyſes and Helyas ſhould prayIere. 14. for them, yet wolde I not heare them: for they loue to go wronge, and do not abſteyn fro iniquitie: albeit they faſt and cry, yet wil I not heare them. And althoughe they offre burnte ſacrifice, I take no pleaſure in it: & therfore praye not for this people, nor yet make any interceſſiō for them, for I wil not heare the. What ſay ye to this wordes papiſtes: the prophete is forbidden too praye. For God ſayeth: he neither will heare hym nor yet the people, he will accept none of their ſacrifices, & that becauſe the people manifeſtly rebelled agaynſt God, reioyced in iniquitie, committed Idolatrye and abomination. And he manifeſtly ſheweth yt nothing maye appeaſe

hym, but true repentance and conuet ſion agayn vnto God.
               O prieſtes, haeth there not as great iniquitie abounded in your dayes, as euer dyd from ye beginninge: Haue ye not ben entyſars and leaders of the people too all Idolatrye: Yea, hath not the miſcheuous example of youre abominable lyues, prouoked thouſands vnto iniquitie: And yet do ye ſay that ye maye apply the merites of Chriſtes paſſion, to whom ye liſt. Heare ye not that God neuer wil accept prayers nor ſacrifice, whyleſt trew repentaunce were foūd? Of that ye were dumme, and alwayes kept ſilence. Your clamor and cryēg was, come, come to the maſſe, bye with money, ſubſtāce & poſſeſſions, remiſſion of your ſinnes. We haue the merites of Chriſtes paſſion, we maye offer Ieſus Chriſt vnto the father, whome he

muſt nedes receyue for an acceptable ſacrifice and ſatiſfaction of all your ſynnes. Thinke not brethren that I alledge anye thinge vpon them, which they them ſelfs do not ſpeake: as their owne lawe and maſſe ſhall teſtifye in the beginninge of the Canō.

vſurpe the honor too make ſacrifice: excepte he be called by God as was Aaron? Haue ye the ſame commaundemente, whiche was geuen vnto Aaron▪ hys ſacrifices are abrogated by Chriſte. Let vs heare where ye are commaunded to make ſacrifice? Serche the ſcriptures, but ſerche theym with iudgement. It wil not be, hoc facite, for that is ſpoken of eatinge, drinkinge, and thankeſgeuing, and not of ſacrifice making. Nor yet wil the order of Melchi ſedeck, nor the text of Malachias proue you prieſtes to make ſacrifice. Aduiſe with other that haue more appearaunce, to proue your entent. For if theſe be wel pondered, the weight of them wil depreſſe the proudnes of youre papiſticall prieſthode.

               The newe teſtament is eternal:Eſai. 9. Iere. 31. that is once made, cā neuer be diſſolued, and therefore the cloudde wherwith this teſtament is cōfirmed is eternall: for it is the bloud of the eternal ſonne of God: onely the bloud of Chriſt taketh awaye oure ſynnes. For it is he alone yt taketh away ye ſynnes of ye world. And who by hys owne bloudde,Colloſ. 1. Nota. hath reconcyled all. For if otherwayes ſynne might haue ben takē awaye, then Chriſte had dyed in vayne. And if full remiſſion ſtode not in hym alone, then they yt eate him yet hungered, and they that dranke hym yet thirſted. And yt were contrarye too hys owne woordes.
               The bloudde of Chriſte is onceIoan. 6. offered, and is ſufficient. For it is

the eternall bloude of the eternall ſonne of God, and by hys owne bloud hath he once entered in too the holy place.
               Therfore the bloude of Chriſt once offered remayneth for euer, for purgation of all ſynnes, and ſo reſteth then no ſacrifice in the maſſe.

of the olde lawe were onely figures of that very & trewe ſacrifice, once offered by Ieſus Chriſt: and in them was commemoration of ſynnes made: but neither was remiſſion obteyned, nor purgation made by any ſuch ſacrifice. What will ye do r

               A ſacrifice for ſynne was neuer perfyte, vntyll that the beaſte offred was kylled. If in youre maſſe ye offre Ieſus Chriſte for ſynne: then neceſſarelye in youre maſſe muſte ye nedes kyll Ieſus Chriſte.

               They are collected of the very grounde of ſcriptures. For they plainly teſtify that Chriſte to be offered, Chriſt to ſuffre, & Chriſt to ſhedde hys bloudde or dye, are all one thinge. Paule in the epiſtle to the Hebrues ſayeth: he appeareth nowe in the preſence of God for vs, not to offre hym ſelf often tymes for vs, for otherwyſe it behoued hym to haue ſuffred oftentymes, from the beginning of the worlde. Marke well that Paule maketh, to offre and ſuffre, bothe one thynge. And therefore pro
                  
                     •
                  eth he that Chriſte made but one ſacrifice, becauſe he once did ſuffre the death. Ieſus Chriſt ſaieth, as is written in Mathew, this is my bloude of the new teſtament, whiche ſhalbe ſhedde for you and for many in remiſſion of ſynnes.

Marke that remiſſion of ſynne
                     •
                   is attributed too the ſheddinge of Chriſtes bloudde. And Paule ſaieth, Chriſt is dead for our ſynnes. And in an other place, by one oblation or ſacrifice hath he made vs perſyte foreuer.
               Conſider diligently, that remiſſion of ſynnes is attributed, ſome tyme to the ſheddyng of Chriſtes bloudde, ſome tyme to hys death, and ſome tyme too the hole ſacrifice, whiche he made in ſuffering all payn. And why this? whether if there be diuers manners to obteyn remiſſion of ſynnes? 
                     •
                  o: but becauſe euer
                     •
                   one of theſe thre neceſſarily foloweth other: remiſſion of ſynnes is commonly aſcribed to any of them. For where ſo that euer Chriſte is offred, there is hys bloude ſhedde, & his death ſubſequently foloweth. And ſo papiſtes, if ye offre Chriſte in ſacrifice

for ſynne, ye ſhedde hys bloud, and thus newly kylhym.
               Aduerte, too what fyne youre owne deſyre ſhal bring you, euen to be kyllers of Ieſus Chriſt.
               Ye will ſaye, ye neuer pretended ſuch abomination. I diſpute not what ye entended: but onelye I ſhewe what abſurdite doeth folowe vpon your owne doctrine.
               For neceſſarelye, if ye do offre Chriſte for ſynne, as ye confeſſe, and youre lawe doeth teache, ye cruelly ſhedde hys bloudde, & fynally do kyll hym. But nowe will I releaue you of this anguiſh: dolorouſe it were daily to cōmit mā ſlaughter, & often times to crucify the king of glory: be not affrayed, ye do it not. For Ieſus Chriſte may ſuffre no more, ſhed his blod no more, nor dye no more. For y• he hath dyed, he ſo dyed for ſyn, & that once; and now he lyueth, and

death maye not preuayle againſt hym. And ſo do ye not kyl Chriſt, for no power ye haue too doe theſame. Onely ye haue deceyued the people: cauſinge them beleue, that ye offred Ieſus Chriſte in ſacrifice for ſyn in your maſſe: whiche is fryuole and fals. For Chriſte maye not bee offerred, becauſe he maye not dye.
               I moſte gentellye exhorte all deſyringe too obiecte agaynſte theſe precedentes: ripely too conſider the grounde thereof, whiche ſtandeth not vppon the opinion of man, but vppon the infallible woorde of God. And to reſume euery parte of theſe argumentes, and ley them too the hole bodye of goddes ſcriptures.

And yet too the great blaſphemye of Chriſtes death and open denyall of his paſſion, hath it ben affirmed, taughte and beleued, that the maſſe was a ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead. Whiche opiniō is moſte falſe, vayn & wicked. And ſo I thinke, the maſſe too be abomination and Idolatrye, no man of indifferente iudgemente will denye.☞
               
               Lette no man entend to excuſe the maſſe with the pretext of the Lordes ſupper. For nowe ſhortly wil I proue that therwith it hath no congruence, but is expreſſe cō
                  trarye to it: and hath taken the remembraunce of the ſome oute of mynde. And further it is blaſphemous to y• death of Ieſus Chriſt. Fyrſt they are contrary in inſtitution, for the Lordes ſupper was

inſtitute too be a perpetuall memory of thoſe benefites, whyche we haue receiued by Ieſus Chriſt and by hys death. And firſte we ſhould call to mynd in what eſtate we ſtoode in the loynes of Adā: when that we all blaſphemed the maieſtie of God in hys face.
               Secondly that hys owne incō
                  prehenſible goodnes moued hym to loue vs moſte wretched & myſerable, yea, moſte wicked & blaſphemous: and loue moſte perfyte compelled hym to ſhewe mercy. And mercy pronunced the ſentēce whiche was that his onely ſonne ſhoulde paye the price of oure redemption. Whiche thinge, beinge righteouſly called to memorye in the preſent action of the ſoupper, coulde not but moue vs to vnfeyned thankeſgeuinge vnto God ye father, and to hys onely ſonne Ieſus, who had reſtored vs agayne

to libertie and lyfe. And this is it which Paule cōmandeth, ſayeng: as ofte, as ye ſhall eate of thys bread and dryncke af this cup, ye ſhall declare the Lordes deathe tyll he come: that is, ye ſhal laude, magnify and extolle the lyberall fyndnes of God the father, and the infinite benefytes, whiche ye haue receyued by Chriſtes death.
               But the maſſe is inſtituted, as ye playn woordes thereof, and their owne lawes do witneſſe, too be a ſacrifice for the ſynnes of ye quicke and the dead. For doinge of the whiche ſacrifice, God is bounde not onely to remitte oure ſynnes, but alſo to geue vnto vs what euer we will aſke, & that ſhal teſtifye diuers maſſes, celebrated for diuers cauſes. Some for peace, ſome in time of warre, ſome for rain, ſome for fayre wether, yea, and (alas my hart abhorreth ſuche abomination)

ſome for ſyckeneſſe of beſtyall.
               They will ſaye, they ſeuerally take prayers for obteyning ſuche thinges. And that is all, whiche I deſyre they ſay: for the obtayning of ſuche vayne tryfles, deſtinate they their hole purpoſe, & ſo prophane the ſacrament of Chryſtes bodye and bloudde (if that were any ſacramente, whiche they abuſed ſo) whiche ſhoulde neuer bee vſed, but in memorye of Chriſtes death.
               Then ſhoulde it not be vſed to praye, that the touthe ache bee taken awaye frome vs, that oure Oxen ſhoulde not take the lowing yll, oure Horſe the ſpauen or farſye, and of all manner diſeaſes for our cattel. Yea what was it wherfore ye wolde not ſaye maſſe, peruerſed prieſtes? But let vs heare more.
               
                  The ſupper of the Lord is the 
                     •
                  yfte of Ieſus Chriſte, in whiche we ſhould laude the infinite mercye of God.
               The maſſe is a ſacrifice, which we offer vnto God: for doinge whereof we alledge God ſhoulde loue and commend vs.
               In the ſupper of the Lord, cō
                  feſſe we oure ſelfs redemed from ſynne, by the death and bloude of Ieſus Chriſte onely.
               In the maſſe craue we remiſſiō of ſynnes: yea, and whatſoeuer thyng we lifte, by working of that ſame worke, whiche we preſently do oure ſelfe.
               And here in is the maſſe blaſphemous vnto Chriſte and hys paſſiō. For in ſo farre as it offreth or promitteth remiſſiō of ſynnes: it imputeth imperfection, vppon Chriſte and hys ſacrifice: affyrminge that all ſinnes were not remitted

by hys deathe: but that a great parte are reſerued to be purged by vertue and the value of ye maſſe. And alſo it is iniurius vnto Chriſte: and not onely ſpeakinge moſte falſly of hym, but alſo vſur pynge too itſelfe, that whiche is proper to hym alone.
               For he affirmeth that he alone hath, by hys owne death, purged the ſynnes of the hole world: and that no parte reſteth to be clenſed by any other meanes. But ye maſſe ſyngeth an other ſong, whiche is, that euery day by that oblatiō offred by the prieſtes is ſynne purged, and remiſſion obteyned. Cō
                  ſider papiſtes, what honor youre maſſe geueth vnto Chriſte.

                   we graunt our ſelfes eternal debtours to God, & vnable any waye to make ſatiſfactiō for his infinite benifits, which we haue receiued.
               
                  But in the maſſe alledge we, God too be a debtour vnto vs for oblation of that ſacrifice, whiche we there preſently offre, and dare affirme y• we there make ſatiſfaction by doyng thereof, for the ſinnes of our ſelf and of others.
               If theſe precedentes be not cō

               It ſhall not excuſe you to ſaye the congregation is participante ſpiritually. O wicked antichriſtes, ſayeth not Ieſus Chriſt: Eat of this, and drynke of this all, do this in remembrāce of me? Chriſt commaūdeth not that one ſhould gaſe vpon it, bowe, ducke, & becke thereto: but that we ſhoulde eate, and dryncke therof oure ſelfs: and not that we ſhould behold others do theſame. Oneles we wold confeſſe the death of Ieſus Chriſt to apperteyn nothing to vs.
               For when I eate & drynke at that table, I openlye confeſſe the frute and vertue of Chriſts body, of hys bloude and paſſion too apperteyn to my ſelfe: and that I am

a membre of his miſticall body, & that God the father is appeaſed with me, not withſtandinge my firſt corruptiō & preſēt infirmitie.
