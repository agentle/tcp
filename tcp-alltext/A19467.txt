               Luk: 7.44., or on the penitent Théeſe, which came vnto thee in his laſt houre Luk, 13:43..
            For thou O Lord haſt brought mee home from Baniſhment Heb. 11.13.16, redéemed me from Bondage Gal. 2:4: Gal 5.1.13., withdrawne mee from puniſhment Eſa. 53.3.4., written me vpon thy hands Eſa: 49.16., called me in thy name Reu. 14:1.11 Reu. 22.4., and ſealed mee with thy owne moſt precious bloud Reu. 7:3., and withall, thou haſt

            The Praiſe of WISEDOME. Prouerbs Chap. 3.
            BLeſt is the man that Wiſdome finds,
            And he that doth obtaine
            True Vnderſtanding, and thereof
            Doth know the precious gaine:
            For better tis to get the ſame,
            Then ſiluer ready told,
            And better profit it doth bring
            Then merchandiſe of gold.
            Wiſedome doth precious ſtones exceed
            And all things elſe that are,
            There is nothing thou canſt deſire,
            To be compar'd to her.
            Vpon her right hand is long life,
            Which neuer is bereft,
            Riches and honor doe attend
            And waite vpon the left.
            Her wayes are paſſing pleaſant wayes,
            Her paths are full of reſt,
            She is a tree of life to thoſe
            Which her to ſeeke are preſt.
            Shee is I ſay a tree of Life
            To ſuch as on her hold,
            And ſuch as alway keepe her faſt,
            
               Are bleſſed manifold.
            My ſonne let not theſe things depart,
            Nor from thine eye to paſſe:
            But keepe my lawes and counſels eke,
            And thou ſhalt finde them grace
            Vnto thy mouth, and to thy ſoule
            They ſhall be perfect life.
            So ſhalt thou ſafely walke the way
            Whereas there is no ſtrife:
            Thy foot from ſtumbling ſo thou maiſt
            At all times ſurely keepe.
            When thou lyeſt downe thou needſt not care,
            But reſt and ſweetly ſleepe:
            Thou ſhalt not need to be afraid
            Of any ſodaine feare,
            For violent force of wicked men
            Which chance, take thou no care.
            For violent ruſhing in of ſuch
            As the vngodly are,
            Of them thou needſt not to account,
            Nor let them not thee ſcare.
            For why, the Lord with thee ſhall be
            At hand, and keepe thy foot,
            That by deceiuing ſleights of foes
            Thou neuer ſhalt be tooke.
         
         
            
            THE AVTHOR to his Booke.
            GO thou my Booke with the zeale of my hart
            To all that ſhal come view thee:
            When thou haſt paſt from the Preſſe, & art print
            Cry daily, Come peruſe me:
            If that thou canſt giue to them all content,
            Then is my labour ended,
            Which is the thing that I haue deſired
            For my paines on thee ſpended.
            FINIS.
