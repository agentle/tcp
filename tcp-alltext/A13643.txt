               WHy doeth the worlde carke and care, for glory that is vayne
               Whoſe welth departeth for euermore, and wyl not come agayne
               Whoſe power ſo ſone is ouerthrowen, and falleth in decaye
               As doeth the potte which we ſe made, of brittell moulde and claye.
            
            
               Do ſoner truſte the letters wrytten, vpon the meltynge yſe
               Then flattering chaunce of worldly gyftes, vnconſtaunt as the dyſe
               Whych forgeth vyce in vertues place, moch myſchiefe to procure
               Who can be certayne here to lyue, one mynute of an houre.
            
            
               Tell, where is noble Salomon, in wytte whych dyd excell
               Or Abſalon the beawtyfull, of whom olde ſtorres tell.
               Or where is Sampſon great and ſtrong, vnable to be wonne
               Or Ionathas the pleaſauntſt man, that raygned vnder the ſunne.
            
            
               Wher is Ceſar that mighty Prince, which ruled Eaſt and weſte
               Or Dyues that belly God, whych ſpent both fyſhe and beaſte
               What is become of Cicero, that could ſo well declame
               Or wher is learned Ariſtotle that nowe doeth beare the name
            
            
               Thus noble mē & rulers both, thus tyme which paſſeth away
               Thus kinges which had theyr holdes ful ſtrong to kepe them nyght & daye
               Thus princes once which were of might, & with great power dyd floriſhe
               In the twinkling of an eye, for euermore doth periſhe
            
            
               In howe ſhort ſpace doth ſlyppe awaye, theſe worldly pleaſures all
               Like ſhadowes or ſoch vanities, whych ſone doth ſlyde and fall
               Seducynge vs from heauenly gyftes, whych doeth for vs remayne
               And leade vs to thynges, whych are vngodly vyle and vayne
            
            
               O meat for wormes, O dewe ſone melted, O clotte of bryttle claye
               Why doeſt thou truſt ſtyll to poſſeſſe, that whych wyl ſone decaye
               Thou canſt not tel what ſhal become, of the to morowe nexte
               Therfore do good by thy lyfe tyme, let none of the be vexte.
            
            
               For as the leafe whych wyth the wynde, we ſee dryuen to and fro
               So ſhal thy pryde and gorglous fare, be putte awaye alſo
               Wher is become thy proud carcas, which yu thoughteſt freſhe and gaye
               In ſcripture lykened to the flower, that ſpringeth in the maye.
            
            
               Thinke nothinge thyne that thou mayſt loſe, nor truſt to kepe it ſtyll
               For that thou haſt by worldly chaunce, it fayleth when it wyll
               Wherfore to ſearche immortal thinges, ſe that thou do deuyſe
               The man is bleſte that can and wyll, theſe worldly gyftes deſpyſe.
