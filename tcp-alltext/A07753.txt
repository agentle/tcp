               THere be two whose benifites to vs can neuer be
required: God, and our parents, the one for that
he gaue vs a reasonable soule, the other for that of
thē we haue our beeing. To these the prince & (as
Cicero tearmeth him) the God of the Philosophers
added our maisters, as those by whose directions
the faculties of the reasonable soule be stirred vp
to enter into contemplation, & searching of more
then earthly things: whereby we obtaine a second
being, more to be wished and much more durable
thē that which any man since the worlds creatiō hath receiued of his parents:
causing vs liue in the mindes of the vertuous, as it were, deified to the posteritie.
The consideration of this hath moued me to publish these labors of
mine vnder your name both to signifie vnto the world, my thankfull mind: &
also to notifie vnto your selfe in some sort the entire loue and vnfained affection
which I beare vnto you. And seeing we liue in those daies wherein enuie
raigneth; and that it is necessary for him who shall put to light any such thing
as this is, to choose such a patron, as both with iudgement may correct it, and
with authority defend him from the rash censures of such as thinke they gaine
great praise in condemning others: Accept (I pray you) of this booke, both
that you may exercise your deepe skill in censuring of what shall be amisse, as
also defend what is in it truely spoken, as that which somtime proceeded from
your selfe. So shall your approbation cause me thinke the better of it, & your
name set in the forefront thereof be sufficient to abate the furie of many insulting
momistes who think nothing true but what they doo themselues. And as
those verses were not esteemed Homers which Aristarchus had not approuod,
so wil I not auouch for mine that which by your censure shalbe condemned.
And so I rest,
            
               In all loue and affection to you most addicted, THOMAS MORLEY.

            Impart your paines to praise his worthy skill,
            Then vnto him that taketh sole delight,
            In your sweet art, therewith the world to fill.
            Then turne your tunes to Morleys worthy prayse,
            And sing of him that sung of you so long:
            His name with laud and with dew honour rayse,
            That hath made you the matter of his song.
            Like Orpheus sitting on high Thracian hill,
            That beasts and mountaines to his ditties drew,
            So doth be draw with his sweete musicks skill
            Men to attention of his Science trew.
            Wherein it seemes that Orpheus he exceeds,
            For he wyld beasts, this men with pleasure feeds.

               ❧ To the curteous Reader.
            
               
                  I
                Do not doubt, but many (who haue knowen my disposition
in times past) will wonder that (amongst so manie
excellent Musicions as be in this our contrie at this
time, and farre better furnished with learning then my
selfe,) I haue taken vpon mee to set out that in our vulgar
tongue, which of all other things hath beene in writing
least knowen to our contrimen, and most in practise.
Yet if they would consider the reasons mouing mee
therevnto: they would not onely leaue to marueile, but
also thinke mee worthie, if not of praise, yet of pardon for
my paines. First, the earnest intreatie of my friends
daily requesting, importuning, and as it were adiuring
me by the loue of my contrie, which next vnto the glorie of God, ought to be most deere to
euery man. Which reason so often tolde and repeted to mee by them, chiefely caused mee
yeld to their honest request in taking in hand this worke which now I publish to the viewe
of the worlde: Not so much seeking thereby any name or glorie, (though no honest minde
do contemne that also, and I might more largely by other meanes and lesse labour haue obtained)
as in some sort to further the studies of them, who (being indewed with good naturall
wittes, and well inclined to learne that diuine Art of Musick) are destitute of sufficient
masters. Lastly, the solitarie life which I lead (being compelled to keepe at home)
caused mee be glad to finde any thing wherein to keepe my selfe exercised for the benefite
of my contrie. But as concerning the booke it selfe, if I had before I began it, imagined
halfe the paines and labour which it cost mee, I would sooner haue beene perswaded to anie
thing, then to haue taken in hand such a tedious peece of worke, like vnto a great Sea,
which the further I entred into, the more I sawe before mee vnpast: So that at length
dispairing euer to make an end (seeing that growe so bigg in mine hands, which I thought
to haue shut vp in two or three sheetes of paper,) I layde it aside, in full determination to
haue proceeded no further, but to haue left it off as shamefully as it was foolishly begonne.
But then being admonished by some of my friends, that it were pittie to lose the frutes of
the imployment of so manie good houres, and how iustly I should be condemned of ignorant
presumpsion, in taking that in hand which I could not performe, if I did not go forwarde:
I resolued to endure whatsoeuer paine, labour, losse of time and expence, and what not?
rather then to leaue that vnbrought to an end, in the which I was so farre ingulfed.
Taking therefore those precepts which being a childe I learned, and laying them togither
in order, I began to compare them with some other of the same kinde, set downe by some
late writers: But then was I in a worse case then before. For I found such diuersitie betwixt
them, that I knew not which part said truest, or whome I might best beleeue. Then
was I forced to runne to the workes of manie, both strangers and English men (whose labours
togithers with their names had beene buried with mee in perpetuall obliuion, if it
had not beene for this occasion) for a solution and clearing of my doubt. But to my great
griefe, then did I see the most part of mine owne precepts false and easie to be confuted by
the workes of Tauerner, Fairfax, Cooper, and infinite more, whose names it would be
too tedious to set downe in this place. But what labour it was to tomble, tosse, & search so
manie bookes, & with what toyle & wearinesse I was enforced to cōpare the parts for trying
out the valure of some notes, (spending whole daies, yea & manie times weekes for the
demonstration of one example, which one would haue thought might in a moment haue
been set down,) I leaue to thy discretion to consider: and none can fully vnderstande, but
he who hath had or shall haue occasion to do the like. As for the methode of the booke,

although it be not such as may in euery point satisfie the curiositie of Dichotomistes: yet
is it such as I thought most conuenient for the capacitie of the learner. And I haue had
an especiall care, that nothing should be set out of his owne place, but that it which should
serue to the vnderstanding of that which followeth should be set first. And as for the
definition, diuision, partes, & kindes of Musicke, I haue omitted them as things onely seruing
to content the learned, and not for the instruction of the ignorant. Thus hast thou
the reasons which moued mee to take in hand & go forward with the booke. The paines
of making whereof, though they haue beene peculier to mee, & onely to mee: yet will the
profit redound to a great number. And this much I may boldly affirme, that any of but
meane capacitie, so they can but truely sing their tunings, which we commonly call the sixe
notes, or vt, re, mi, fa, sol, la, may without any other help sauing this booke, perfectly learn
to sing, make discant, and set partes well and formally togither. But seeing in these latter
daies & doting age of the worlde, there is nothing more subiect to calumnie & backbiting
then that which is most true & right: and that as there be many who will enter into the
reading of my booke for their instruction: so I doubt not but diuerse also will read it, not
so much for anie pleasure or profit they looke for in it, as to finde some thing whereat to repine,
or take occasion of backbyting. Such men I warne, that if in friendship they will (eyther
publikly or priuately) make me acquainted with any thing in the booke, which either
they like not or vnderstand not: I will not onely be content to giue them a reason (and if
I cannot, to turne to their opinion,) but also thinke my selfe highly beholding to them.
But if any man, either vpon mallice, or for ostentation of his owne knowledge, or for ignorance
(as who is more bolde then blinde bayerd) do either in huggermugger or openly calumniate
that which either he vnderstandeth not, or then maliciously wresteth to his own
sense, he (as Augustus said by one, who had spoken euill of him) shall finde that I haue a
tongue also: and that me remorsurum petit, He snarleth at one who will bite againe, because
I haue saide nothing without reason, or at least confirmed by the authorities of the
best, both schollers & practicioners. There haue also been some, who (knowing their own
insufficiencie, and not daring to disallow, nor being able to improue any thing in the booke)
haue neuerthelesse gone about to discredite both mee and it another waie, affirming that
I haue by setting out thereof maliciously gone about to take awaye the liuings from a nomber
of honest poore men, who liue (and that honestly) vpon teaching not halfe of that which
in this booke may be found. But to answere those malicious caterpillers, who liue vpon the
paines of other men,) this booke will be so farre from the hinderance of anie, that by the
contrarie, it will cause those whome they alledge to be thereby damnified, to be more able
to giue reason for that which they do: Whereas before they either did it at hap-hazerd, or
for all reasons alledged, that they were so taught. So that if any at all owe mee any thanks
for the great paines which I haue taken, they be in my iudgement, those who taught that
which they knew not, and may here if they will learne. But if the effect do not answere to
my good meaning▪ and if manie do not reape that benefit which I hoped; yet there wil be
no reason why I should be blamed, who haue done what I could, and giuen an occasion to
others of better iudgement and deeper skill then my selfe to doe the like. And as for
those ignorant Asses, who take vpon them to lead others, none being more blinde then
themselues, and yet without any reason, before they haue seene their workes, wil condemne
other men, I ouerpasse them, as being vnworthie to be nominated, or that any man should
vouchsafe to aunswere them: for they be in deede such as doing wickedly hate the light
for feare they should be espyed. And so (gentle Reader) hoping by thy fauourable curtesie,
to auoide both the malice of the enuious & the temeritie of the ignorant, wishing
thee the whole profit of the booke and all perfection in thy studies, I rest.

               Polymathes.
               
                  STaye (brother Philomathes) what haste? Whither
go you so fast?
            
            
               Philomathes.
               To seeke out an old frind of mine.
            
            
               Pol.
               But before you goe, I praie you repeat
some of the discourses which you had yester night
at master Sophobulus his banket: For commonly
he is not without both wise and learned guestes.
            
            
               Phi.
               It is true in deede. And yester night, there
were a number of excellent schollers, (both gentlemen
and others:) but all the propose which then
was discoursed vpon, was Musicke.
            
            
               Pol.
               I trust you were contented to suffer others
to speake of that matter.
            
            
               Phi.
               I would that had been the worst: for I was compelled to discouer mine own
ignorance, and confesse that I knewe nothing at all in it.
            
            
               Pol.
               How so?
            
            
               Phi.
               Among the rest of the guestes, by chaunce, master Aphron came thether
also, who falling to discourse of Musicke, was in an argument so quickely taken vp &
hotly pursued by Eudoxus and Calergus, two kinsmen of Sophobulus, as in his owne
art he was ouerthrowne. But he still sticking in his opinion, the two gentlemen
requested mee to examine his reasons, and confute them. But I refusing & pretending
ignorance, the whole companie condemned mee of discurtesie, being fully
perswaded, that I had beene as skilfull in that art, as they tooke mee to be learned in
others. But supper being ended, and Musicke bookes, according to the custome being
brought to the table: the mistresse of the house presented mee with a part, earnestly
requesting mee to sing. But when after manie excuses, I protested vnfainedly
that I could not: euerie one began to wonder. Yea, some whispered to others, demaunding
how I was brought vp: so that vpon shame of mine ignorance I go nowe
to seeke out mine olde frinde master Gnorimus, to make my selfe his scholler.
            
            
               Pol.
               I am glad you are at length come to bee of that minde, though I wished it
sooner: Therefore goe, and I praie God send you such good successe as you would
wish to your selfe. As for mee, I goe to heare some Mathematicall Lectures, so that
I thinke, about one time wee may both meete at our lodging.
            
            
               
               Phi.
               Farewell, for I sit vpon thornes till I be gone: therefore I will make haste.
But if I be not deceiued, I see him whome I seeke sitting at yonder doore, out of
doubt it is hee. And it should seeme he studieth vpon some point of Musicke; But I
will driue him out of his dumpe. Good morrow Sir.
            
            
               Master.
               And you also, good master Philomathes, I am glad to see you, seing it is
so long agoe since I sawe you, that I thought you had either been dead, or then had
vowed perpetually to keepe your chamber and booke, to which you were so much
addicted.
            
            
               Phi.
               In deede I haue beene well affected to my booke. But how haue you done
since I sawe you?
            
            
               Ma.
               My health, since you sawe mee, hath beene so badd, as if it had beene the
pleasure of him who may all things, to haue taken me out of the worlde, I should
haue beene verie well contented: and haue wished it more than once. But what businesse
hath driuen you to this end of the towne?
            
            
               Phi.
               My errand is to you, to make my self your scholler. And seeing I haue found
you at such conuenient leisure, I am determined not to depart till I haue one lesson
in Musicke.
            
            
               Ma.
               You tell mee a wonder: for I haue heard you so much speake against that
art, as to terme it a corrupter of good manners, & an allurement to vices, for which
many of your companions termed you a Stoick.
               
            
            
               Phi.
               It is true: But I am so farre changed, as of a Stoick I would willingly make
a Pythagorian. And for that I am impacient of delay, I praie you begin euen now.
            
            
               Ma.
               With a good will. But haue you learned nothing at all in Musick before?
            
            
               Phi.
               Nothing. Therefore I pray begin at theverie beginning, and teach mee as
though I were a childe.
            
            
               Ma.
               I will do so, and therefore behold, here is the Scale of Musicke, which wee
terme the Gam.

               Phi.
               In deede I see letters and syllables written here, but I doe not vnderstand
them nor their order.
            
            
               Ma.
               
                  For the vnderstanding of this Table, You must begin at the lowest word Gamvt,
and so go vpwards to the end still ascending.
            
            
               Phi.
               That I do vnderstand. What is next?
            
            
               Ma.
               Then must you get it perfectly without booke, to saie it forwards and backwards.
Secondly, You must learne to knowe, wherein euery Key standeth, that is, whether in
rule or in space. And thirdly, How manie cliefes and how manie notes euery Key containeth.
            
            
               Phi.
               What do you call a Cliefe, and what a Note?
               
            
            
               Ma.
               A Cliefe is a charecter set on a rule at the beginning of a verse,What a cliefe is. shewing the
heigth and lownes of euery note standing on the same verse, or in space (although vse
hath taken it for a generall rule neuer to set any cleife in the space except the ♭ cleife)
and euery space or rule not hauing a cleife set in it, hath one vnderstoode, being only
omitted for not pestering the verse, and sauing of labor to the writer: but here it is taken
for a letter begining the name of euery keye: and are they which you see here set
at the beginning of euery worde.
            
            
               Phi.
               I take your meaning, so that euery keye hath but one cleife, except, b fa ♭ mi.
            
            
               Ma.
               
                  You haue quickly and well conceiued my meaning. The residue which you
see written in Syllables are the names of the Notes.
            
            
               Phi.
               In this likewise I thinke I vnderstand your meaning. But I see no reason, why
you should saye the two bb be two seuerall cliefes, seeing they are but one twise
named.
            
            
               Ma.
               The Herralds shall answere that for mee: for if you should aske them, why
two men of one name should not both giue one Armes? they will straight answere
you, that they be of seuerall houses, and therefore must giue diuers coates. So these
two bb, though they be both comprehended vnder one name, yet they are in nature
and charecter diuers.
            
            
               Phi.
               This I doe not vnderstand.
            
            
               Ma.
               Nor cannot, till you know all the cliefes, and the rising and falling of the
voyce for the true tuning of the notes.
            
            
               Phi.
               I praie you then go forwards with the cliefes: the diffinition of them I haue
heard before.
            
            
               Ma.
               There be in all seuen cliefes (as I told you before) as A. B. C. D. E. F. G.
                  How manie cliefes there be.
but in vse in singing there be but foure: that is to saie, the F fa vt, which is commonly
in the Basse or lowest part,The formes of the vsuall cliefes. being formed or made thus 𝄢. The C sol fa vt
cliefe which is common to euery part, and is made thus 𝄡. The G sol re vt cliefe,
which is commonly vsed in the Treble or highest part, and is made thus 𝄞. And
the ♭ cliefe which is comon to euery part, is made thus ♭ or thus ♮ the one signifying
the halfe note and flatt singing: the other signifying the whole note or sharpe
singing.
            
            
               Phi.
               Now that you haue tolde mee the cliefes, it followeth to speake of the tuning
of the Notes.
            
            
               Ma.
               It is so, and therefore be attentiue and I will be briefe. There be in Musicke
but vj.The sixe notes in continuall deduction. Notes, which are called, vt, re, mi, fa, sol, la, and are comonly set down thus:

                     〈♫〉
                  
               
            
            
               Phi.
               In this I vnderstand nothing, but that I see the F fa vt cliefe
standing on the fourth rule from beneath.
            
            
               Ma.
               And do you not vnderstand wherin the first note standeth?
            
            
               Phi.
               Verily,How to know wherein euery note standeth. no.
            
            
               Ma.
               You must then recken downe from the Cliefe, as though the verse were the

                  Scale of Musicke, assigning to euerie space and rule a seuerall Keye.
               
            
            
               Phi.
               This is easie. And by this meanes I finde that the first note standeth in Gamvt,
and the last in E la mi.
               
            
            
               Ma.
               You saie true. Now sing them.
            
            
               Phi.
               How shall I terme the first note?
            
            
               Ma.
               If you remember that which before you tolde mee you vnderstood: you
would resolue your selfe of that doubt. But I pray you in Gam vt, how manie cliefs,
and how manie notes?
            
            
               Phi.
               One cliefe & one note. O I crye you mercie, I was like a potte with a wide
mouth, that receiueth quickly, and letteth out as quickly.
            
            
               Ma.
               Sing then after mee till you can tune: for I will lead you in the tuning, and
you shall name the notes your selfe.
            
            
               Phi.
               I can name them right till I come to C fa vt. Now whether I terme
this fa, or vt?
               
            
            
               Ma.
               Take this for a generall rule,A note for singing of Vt. that in one deduction of the sixe notes, you can
haue one name but once vsed, although in deede (if you could keepe right tune) it were
no matter how you named any note. But this wee vse commonly in singing, that
except it be in the lowest note of the part wee neuer vse vt.
               
            
            
               Phi.
               How then? Do you neuer sing vt but in Gam vt?
               
            
            
               Ma.
               Not so: But if either Gam vt, or C fa vt, or F fa vt, or G sol re vt, be the
lowest note of the parte, then we may sing vt there.
            
            
               Phi.
               Now I conceiue it.
            
            
               Ma.
               Then sing your sixe notes forward and backward.
            
            
               Phi.
               
                  
                     〈♫〉
                   
                  Is this right?
Vt re mi fa sol la la sol fa mi re vt
            
            
               Ma.
               Verie well.
            
            
               Phi.
               Now I praie you shew me all the seuerall Keyes wherein you may begin your
sixe notes.
            
            
               Ma.
               Lo here they be set downe at length.

               Phi.
               Be these all the wayes you may haue these notes in the whole Gam?
               
            
            
               Ma.
               These and their eights: as what is done in Gam vt may also be done in G sol
re vt, and likewise in g sol re vt in alt. And what in C fa vt, may be also in C sol
fa vt, and in C sol fa. And what in F fa vt in Base, may also be done in f fa vt in alt.
But these be the three principall keyes containing the three natures or properties of
singing.
            
            
               Phi.
               Which be the three properties of singing?

               Ma.
               It is propertie of singing, wherein mi is alwaies song in b fa ♮ mi, and is
alwayes when you sing vt in Gam vt.

               It is propertie of singing, wherin you may sing either fa or mi in b fa ♮ mi

               It is a propertie of singing, wherein fa must alwaies be song in b fa ♮ mi, and
is when the vt is in F fa vt.

               Now I thinke I vnderstand all the cliefes, and that you can hardly shewe me

               This is well song: 
                     〈♫〉
                  
Now sing this other.

               This is right: but could you sing it no other wise?
            
            
               Phi.
               No otherwise in tune, though I might alter the names of the notes.

               You do well. Now for the last tryall of your singing in continuall deduction
sing this perfectly, and I will saie you vnderstand plainsong well enough.

               I know not how to beginne.
            
            
               Ma.
               Why?
            
            
               Phi.
               Because, beneath Gam vt there is nothing: and the first note standeth beneath
Gam vt.
               
            
            
               Ma.
               Where as you saie,Musicke is included in no certaine bounds. there is nothing beneath Gam vt, you deceiue your
selfe: For Musicke is included in no certaine bounds, (though the Musicions do include
their songs within a certaine compasse.) And as you Philosophers say, that no
number can be giuen so great, but that you may giue a greater. And no poynt so
small, but that you may giue a smaller. So there can be no note giuen so high, but
you may giue a higher▪ and none so lowe, but that you may giue a lower. And therfore
call to minde that which I tolde you concerning the keyes and their eightes: for
if Mathematically you consider it, it is true as well without the compasse of the
Scale, as within: and so may be continued infinitely.
            
            
               
               Phi.
               Why then was your Scale deuised of xx. notes and no more?
            
            
               Ma.
               Because that compasse was the reach of most voyces:What is to bee sung vnder Gam vt. so that vnder Gam vt
the voice seemed as a kinde of humming, and aboue E la a kinde of constrained skricking.
But wee goe from the purpose, and therefore proceede to the singing of your ensample.
            
            
               Phi.
               Then I perceiue the first note standeth in F fa vt vnder Gam vt, and being the
lowest note of the verse I may there sing vt.
               
            
            
               Ma.
               Right, or fa if you will, as you did in the eyght aboue in the other verse before.
But goe forward.
            
            
               Phi.
               Then though there be no re in Gam vt, nor mi in A re, nor fa in ♮ mi &c. yet
because they be in their eyghtes I may sing them there also. But I pray you why do you
set a ♭ in E la mi? seeing there is neither in it nor in E la mi in alte, nor in E la any fa, and
the ♭ cliefe is onely set to those keyes wherein there is fa.
               
            
            
               Ma.
               Because there is no note of it selfe either flatt or sharpe,Euery note both sharpe and flat. but compared with another,
is sometime flatt and sometime sharpe: so that there is no note in the whole Scale
which is not both sharpe and flatt: And seeing you might sing la in D sol re, you might
also (altering the tune alitle) sing fa in E la mi. There be manie other flattes in Musicke,
as the ♭ in A la mi re, whereof I will not speake at this time, because I will not cloy your
memorie with vnprofitable precepts: and it will be time enough for you to learne them
when you come to practise prick song.
            
            
               Phi.
               This I will then think sufficient till that time, and therefore goe forward to some
other matter.
            
            
               Ma.
               Then seeing you vnderstand continuall deduction, I will shewe you it disiunct

               Here I knowe where all the notes stand: but I know not how to tune them by
reason of their skipping.

haue set downe the Moodes otherwise then they eyther haue been or are taught

               Ma.
               Although it bee hard to assigne the cause, yet may we coniecture that although
the great musicke maisters who excelled in fore time, no doubt weare wonderfully seen
in the knowledge therof, aswell in specilation as practise, yet since their death the knowledge
of the arte is decayed and a more slight or superficiall knowledge come in steede
thereof, so that it is come now adaies to that, that if they know the common Moode
and some Triples, they seeke no further.

               In the Table there is no difficultie,The vse of the precedent Table. if you consider it attentiuely. Yet, to take a
way all scruple, I will shew the vse of it. In the lower part stande the signes, and iust
ouer them the notes, that if you doubt of the value of anie note in anie signe, seeke out
the Signe in the lowest part of the Table; and iust ouer it you shall finde the note:
then at the left hand, you shall see a number set euen with it, shewing the value or howe
many Semibreeues it conteineth. Ouer it you shal find how many of the next lesser notes
belong to it in that signe. As for example in the great Moode perfect you doubt how
manie Breeues the Longe containethan the lowest part of the table on the left hand, you
finde this signe 𝇈3 which is the Moode you sought: iust ouer that signe you finde a
Large, ouer that, the number 3, and ouer that a Longe. Now hauing found your Longe
you finde hard by it on the left hand the number of 9. signifying that it is nyne Semibreeues
in that Moode: Ouer it you finde the figure of three, signifying that there belong
three Breeues to the Longe in that Moode: and so foorth with the rest.
            
            
               Phi.
               This is easie and verie profitable, therefore seeing you haue set downe the ancient
Moodes (which hereafter may come in request, as the shotten-bellied doublet, &
the great breeches,) I praie you come to the declaration of those which wee vse nowe.
            
            
               Ma.
               I wil, but first you shall haue an example of the vse of your Moodes in singing,
where also you haue an example of augmentation, (of which wee shall speake another

time) in the Treble and Meane partes. The Tenor part expresseth the lesser moode perfect,
                  This is imperfection, whereof hereafter.
that is, three Breeues to the Longe, the blacke Longs containe but two Breeues. But
when a white Breefe or a Breefe rest doeth immediatly follow a Longe, then the Longe is
but two Breeues, as in your Tenor appeareth. Your Base expresseth time perfect,
where euerie Breefe containeth three Semibreeues, except the blacke, which containeth
but two.

foure Moodes now in common vse: Perfect of the more prolation. Perfect of the lesse
prolation. Imperfect of the more prolation. And Imperfect of the lesse prolation. The
moode perfect of the more is, when all go by three: as three Longes to the Large: three
Breeues to the Long: three Semibreeues to the Breefe: three Minomes to the Semibreefe.

two Semibreeues to the Briefe, and three Minomes to the Semibriefe: so that though

Breeues sixe. and whereas there is a breefe rest in the beginning of the Base, that you

               Yes, for though in this Moode, and likewise in the other of this prolation,
euerie Semibreefe be three Minymes: yet if an odd Minyme come immediatly either after
or before (but most commonly after) a semibreefe, then is the semibreefe sung but for
two minymes, and that other Minyme maketh vp the nomber for the stroke. But to the
intent that the singer may the more easily perceiue when the Minyme is to be taken in
with the Semibreefe, and when it is to be left out: the maisters 
                     〈♫〉
                  
haue deuised a certaine pricke (called a pricke of diuision)
which being set betwixt a Semibreefe and a minyme thus:A prick of diuision, with the nature & vse thereof.
                  sheweth, that the Semibreefe is perfect, and that the minyme next
following doth belong to another stroke.
               
            
            
               Likewise, if the pricke of diuision come betwixt two minymes, thus: 
               
                  〈♫〉
               
it signifieth, that the Semibreefe going before is vnperfect, and that

               In this Moode euery semibreefe is two minymes or one full stroke. Euery breefe
three semibreefes,
                  The value of the notes in this Moodd. 
                  except it be blacke, in which case it is but two. Euery longe is sixe semibreefes,
except it be blacke, and then it is but foure, or haue a semibreefe following it noted
with a prick of diuision thus: 
                  
                     〈♫〉
                   
                  and then it is fiue, and the other semibreefe maketh
vp the full time of sixe.
                  The value of a Long hauing a semibreef with a prick of diuision after it. And though this hath beene receiued by the
composers, yet haue they but small reason to allow of it: for of Iusquin
they had it in the Tenor part of the Gloria of his Masse Aue Maris stella: but Iusquin in
that place vsed it for an extremitie, because after the longe came two semibreefes & then
a breefe: so that if the first semibreefe had not beene taken in for one belonging to the
longe, the second must haue beene song in the time of two semibreefes and noted with a
pricke of alteration, as in these his notes you may see. 
                     〈♫〉
                  
And though (as I said) he vsed it vpon an extremitie,
yet finde, I it so vsed of many others without any necessitie.
And amongest the rest master Tauerner in his Kyries and Alleluyas, and therefore
I haue set it downe in this place because you should not be ignorant how to sing
such an example if you should finde any hereafter in other songs.

                  If you remember that which I told you in the obseruations of the perfect moode
of this prolation, you would not aske mee that question: For what I tolde you there concerning
a minyme following a semibreefe in the more prolation, is as well to be vnderstoode of
a minyme rest as of a minyme it selfe.

               You see the minyme in d la sol marked with a pricke, and if you consider the tyming
of the song, you shal finde that the minym going before that beginneth the stroke,
so that those two minymes must make vp a full stroke. You must then knowe, that if you
finde a prick so following a Minyme in this Moode,
                  A pricke of alteration. 
                  it doubleth the value theeof & maketh
it two Minymes, and then is the pricke called a pricke of alteration. The blacke semibriefe
is alwaies two minymes in this Moode, and the black breefe twise so much, which is foure
minymes, and this is all to be obserned in this Moode.

               Although that rule bee not so generally kept: but that the composers set the same signe
before songs of the semibriefe time: But this I may giue you for an infalable rule, that if
a song of many parts haue this Moode of the imperfect of the lesse prolation, set in one
parte with a stroke through it, and in another part without the stroke, than is that parte

which hath the signe with the stroke so diminished, as one briefe standeth for a semibriefe
of the other part which hath the figne without the strok, whereof you shal see an
euident example after that we haue spoken of the proportions.zaccone. Berrhusius cum alijs. But if the signe be crossed
thus 
                     
                        
                     
                     timeimperf-prolatimperf-x
                   then is the song so noted, so diminished in his notes, as foure semibriefes are
song but for one, which you shall more cleerely perceiue heereafter, when we come to
speake of diminution. The other sort of setting the Moode thus 𝇋 belongeth to Madrigals,
Canzonets, and such like.
               This much for the Moodes by them selues: but before I proceede to the declaration
of the altering of them, I must giue you an obseruation to bee kept in perfect Moodes.

               It is commonly called imperfection.

                  It is the taking away of the third part of a perfect notes value, and is done three maner
of wayes, By note, rest, or cullor. Imperfection by note, is when before or after anie
note there commeth a note of the next lesse value, as thus.

The example whereof you had in your Tenor part of the song set next after the former
Moodes. But the examples of perfection and imperfection, are so common, specially in
the Moodes of perfect time and more prolation, that it would be superfluous to set them
downe. There is also another obseruation a kin to this, to be obserued likewise in Moods
perfect, and is termed alteration.

                  It is the doubling of the value of any note for the obsaruation of the odde number,
                  Alteration. and
that is it which I told you of in the example of the Moode perfect of the Moore prolation,
so that the note which is to be altered is commonly marked with a pricke of alteration.

               Of the altering of the Moods proceedeth augmentation, ordiminution, augmentation
proceedeth of setting the signe of the more prolation in one parte of the songe onely,
                  Augmentation
                  and not in others, and is an increasing of the value of the notes aboue their common
and essentiall valor, which commeth to them by signes let before them, or
Moodes set ouer them, or numbers set by them. Augmentation by numbers is
when proportions of the lesse in aequalitie are set downe, meaning that euery note and rest

following are so often to bemultiplyed in them selues, as the lower number contayneth
the higher thus. 12 13 14 &c. that is, the minym to be a semibrief, the semibriefe a briefe &c.
but by reason that this is better conceiued by deede than worde, heere is an example of
augmentation in the Tenor part.

               Proportion is either of equalitie or vnequalitie. Proportion of aequalitie, is
the comparing of two aequall quantities togither,Proportion of the more inaequalitie doth in Musicke alwaies signifie diminution. in which, because there is no difference,
we will speake no more at this time. Proportion of inaequalitie is, when two things
of vnequall quantitie are compared togither, and is either of the more or lesse inaequalitie.
Proportion of the more inaequalitie is, when a greater number is set ouer and compared
to a lesser, and in Musicke doeth alwaies signifie diminution. Proportion of the lesse
inaequalitie is, where a lesser number is set ouer, and compared to a greater, as 23, and in
Musicke doeth alwaies signifye augmentation.
               
            
            
               Phi.
               How manie kindes of Proportions doe you commonly vse in Musicke? for I am
perswaded it is a matter impossible to sing them all, especially those which be tearmed
superpercients.
               
            
            
               Ma.
               
                  You saie true, although there be no proportion so harde but might be made in Musicke,
but the hardnesse of singing them, hath caused them to be left out, and therefore there
be but fiue in most common vse with vs: Dupla, Tripla, Quaedrupla Sesquialtera, and
Sesquitertia.
            
            
               Phi.
               What is Dupla proportion in Musicke?
            
            
               Ma.
               It is that which taketh halfe the value of euery note and rest from it,Dupla. so that two
notes of one kinde doe but answere to the value of one: and it is knowen when the vpper
number contayneth the lower twise thus. 21 42 63 84 126 &c. But by the way you must
note that time out of minde we haue tearmed that dupla where we set two Minymes
to the Semibriefe, which if it were trew, there should be few songs but you should haue
dupla quadrupla and octupla in it, and then by consequent must cease to be dupla. But if
they thinke that not inconuenient,A confutation of Dupla in the minyme. I pray them how will they answere that which from
time to time hath been set downe for a general rule amongst all musitions, that proportions
of the greater inequalitie, do alwaies signifie dimunution, and if their minyms be diminished,
I pray you how shall two of them make vp the time of a full stroke, for in all

proportions the vpper number signifieth the semibriefe, and the lower number the stroke, so
that as the vpper number is to the lower, so is the semibriefe to the stroke. Thus if a man
would goe seeke to refute their Inueterat opinions, it were much labour spent in vayne:
but this one thing I will adde, that they haue not their opinion confirmed by the Testimony
of any, either musition or writer, where as on the other side, all who haue beene
of any name in Musicke, haue vsed the other dupla, and set it downe in their works, as
you may see in the example following, confirmed by the authorities of Peter Aron,
Franchinus, Iordanus, and nowe of late dayes, learned Glareanus, Losius, Listenius,
Berhusius and a greate number more, all whome it were to tedius to nominate:
true it is that I was taught the contrary my selfe, and haue seene many old written
books to the same ende. But yet haue I not seene any published vnder any mans name:
but if their opinion had been true, I maruayle that non amongst so many good musitions
haue eyther gone about to proue the goodnesse of their owne waie, or refute the
opinions of others from time to time by general consent and approbation, taking new
strength: therefore let no man cauil at my doing in that I haue chaunged my opinion
and set downe the proportions otherwise then I was taught them, For I assure them
that if any man will giue mee stronger reason to the coutrary, than those which I haue
brought for my defence, I will not onely chaunge this opinion, but acknowledge my
selfe debt bound to him, as he that hath brought me out of an error to the way of trueth.
            
            
               Phi.
               I doubt not but your maister who taught you would thinke it as lawfull for you to
goe from his opinion, as it was for Aristotle to disalow the opinion of Plato with this
reason, that Socrates was his friend, Plato was his friend but verity was his greater friend.
            
            
               Ma.
               Yet will I (to content others) set downe the proportions at the ende of this
treatise as they are commonly prickt now, to let you see that in the matter there is no
difference betwixt vs, except onely in forme of pricking, which they doe in great notes
and we in small: and to the ende, that if any man like his owne way better than this, hee
may vse his owne discretion: But we goe too farre, and therefore peruse your example.

Heere is likewise another ensample wherein Tripla is in all the parts together, which if
you pricke al in blacke notes, will make that proportion which the musitions falslie termed
Hemiolia,
                  A confutation of hemiolia. when in deed it is nothing else but a round Tripla. For Hemiola doth signifie
that which the Latines tearme Sesquipla or sesquialtra: but the good Munks finding
it to go somwhat rounder then common tripla, gaue it that name of Hemiolia for lacke
of another. But for their labour they were roundly taken vp by Glareanus, Lossius and others.

multiplicitie, because a man may consider them infinitly.

               Come then to Sequialtera,
                  Sesquialtera. what is it?
            
            
               Ma.
               It is when three notes are sung to two of the same kinde, and is knowne by a

number contayning another once, and his halfe 32 64 96 the example of this you shal haue
amongst the others. Sesquitercia is when foure notes are sung to three of the same
kinde, and is knowen by a number set before him, contayning another once, and his
third part thus. 43 86 129 And these shall suffice at this time: For knowing these, the rest are
easelie learned. But if a man would ingulfe himselfe to learne to sing, and set downe all
them which Franchinis Gaufurius hath set downe in his booke De proportionibus musicis,
he should finde it a matter not onely hard, but almost impossible. But if you thinke
you would be curious in proportions, and exercyse your selfe in them at your leasure.
Heere is a Table where you may learne them at full.

As for the vse of this Table, when you would know what proportion any one number
hath to another, finde out the two numbers in the Table, then looke vpwarde to
the triangle inclosing those numbers, and in the angle of concourse, that is, where
your two lynes meete togither, there is the proportion of your two numbers written:
as for example, let your two numbers be 18▪ and 24▪ Looke vpward, and in the top of the
tryangle couering the two lynes which inclose those numbers, you find written sesquitertia,
so likewise 24. and 42. you finde in the Angle of concurse written super tripartiens
quartas, and so of others.

               Heere is a Table in deede contayning more than euer. I meane to beate my
brayns about. As for musick, the principal thing we seek in it, is to delight the eare, which
cannot so perfectly be done in these hard proportions, as otherwise, therefore proceede
to the rest of your musicke, specially to the example of those Proportions which you
promised before.
            
            
               Ma.
               I will, but before I giue it you, I will shew you two others, the one out of the
workes of Iulio Renaldi: the other out of Alexandro Striggio, which because they be
short & wil help you for the vnderstanding of the other, I thought good to set before it.
            
            
               Phi.
               I pray you shew me the true singing of this first, because euery part hath a seuerall
Moode and prolation.
            
            
               Ma.
               The Treble contayneth Augmentation of the Moore prolation in the subdupla
proportion,Explanation of the example next ensuing. so that euery semibreefe lacking an odde minyme following, it is three:
But if it haue a minyme following it, the semibriefe it selfe is two semibriefs and the minyme
one. The Altus and Quintus be of the lesse prolation, so that betwixt them ther is
no difference,Giulio Renaldi in the eight song of his Madrigali and Neapolitans to fiue voyces beginning diuerse lingue.
                   sauing that in the Quintus the time is perfect, and by that meane euerie
briefe three semibriefs. Your Tenor is the common Moode of the imperfect of the lesse
prolation, diminished in dupla proportion, so that in it there is no difficultie. Lastly your
Base conteyneth diminution of diminution or diminution in quadrupla proportion, of that
(as I shewed you before) euery long is but a semibreefe, and euery semibriefe is but a
crochet. And to the ende that you may the more easelie vnderstand the contryuing of
the parts, and their proportion one to another, I haue set it downe in partition.

               This hath been a mightie musicall furie, which hath caused him to shewe such
diuersitie in so small bounds.

               True, but he was moued so to doe by the wordes of his text, which reason also
mouid Alexandro Striggio to make this other, wherein you haue one poynt handled
first in the ordinary Moode through all the parts, then in Tripla through all the parts,
and lastly in proportions, no part like vnto another, for the Treble contayneth diminution
in the quadrupla proportion. The second Treble or sextus hath Tripla prickt all in
blacke notes: your Altus or Meane contayneth diminution in Dupla proportion. The
Tenor goeth through with his Tripla (which was begonne before) to the ende. The
Quintus is sesquialtra to the breefe which hath this signe 𝇍 32 set before it: But if the
signe were away, then would three minyms make a whole stroke, where as nowe three
semibriefs make but one stroke The Base is the ordinary Moode, wherein is no difficulty
as you may see.

And to the end that you may see how euerie thing hangeth vpon another, and howe
the proportions follow others, I will shew you particularlie euerie one. The first chāge
which commeth after the proportion of equalitie, is commonlie called sextupla, or six
to one, signified by the more prolation, retorted thus
But if we consider rightlie that which we call sextupla, 
               
                  〈♫〉
                is but true
tripla, prickt in blacke notes. But because I made it to expresse
sextupla, I haue set it downe in semibriefes, allowing sixe for a
stroke, and taking awaie the retortiue mood, The next proportion
is true Dupla: signified by the time vnperfect of the lesse prolation, retorted thus.
which manner of marking Dupla cannot be disallowed: but if the proportion

                  〈♫〉
                next before had beene signified by anie mood, then might not
this Dupla haue beene signified by the retort, but by proportionate
numbers. Thirdlie commeth the lesse prolation in the meane part, &
that ordinarie Tripla of the blacke minimes to a stroke in the base: and
because those three blacke minimes, be sung in the time of two white minimes, they
were marked thus 𝇊32. signifieng three minimes to two minimes. But if the signe of
the prolation had been left out, & all been prickt in white notes, then had it been true
thus 
                  〈♫〉
                And in this maner most commonlie do the Italians signifie
their three minimes to a stroke or tripla of three minimes,
which is indeed true Sesquialtra. But because wee woulde
here expresse true tripla, I haue set it downe thus,

                  〈♫〉
                Therefore to destroy the proportion follow these proportionate
numbers at the signe of degree thus 𝇋13 which maketh
the common time vnpetfect of the lesse prolation.
            Then followeth true tripla, which they call tripla to the Semibriefe. But because it is
afterwardes broken, I thought it better to pricke it white then blacke: but the matter is
come so farre nowadaies, that some wil haue all semibrieues in proportion prickt black
else (say they) the proportion will not be knowne. But that is false, as being grounded
neither vpon reason nor authoritie. The tripla broken in the more prolation, maketh
nine minimes for one stroke, which is our common Nonapla, but in one place of the
broken tripla, where a semibriefe and a minime come successiuelie that they marked
with these numbers 92, which is the sigue of Quadrupla sesquialtra, if the numbers were
perpendicularly placed: but if that were true, why should not the rest also which were
before be so noted, seeing nine of them were sung to two minymes of the Treble.
Then followeth true Dupla: but for the reason before saide, I signifyed it with numbers
and not by the retort but in the Basse, because the signe of the lesse prolation went immediately
before, I could not with reason alter it, and therefore I suffered the retort to
stand still, because I thought it as good as the proportionat numbers in that place. Then
againe followeth true Tripla in the more prolation, afterward the contrarie numbers
13 of Sub Tripla destroying the proportion the more prolation remaineth, 
                  〈♫〉
               
to which the Basse singeth Quintupla being prickt thus
such was our maner of pricking without any reason or almost
common sence, to make fiue crotchets be Quintupla to a Semibriefe, seeing foure of
them are but the propper value of one Semibreefe. But if they wonld make fiue crotchets
to one femibreefe, then must they set downe Sequiquarta proportion thus 14,
wherein fiue semibriefes or their value make vp the time of foure semibriefes or strokes.
But I am almost out of my purpose, and to returne to our matter, I haue altered those
crotchets into semibriefes expressing true Quintupla. Then commeth Quintupla broken,
which is our common Decupla, But if the other were Quintupla, then is this likewise

               Quintupla, because there goeth but the value of fiue semibriefes for a stroke, and
I thinke none of vs but would tsiinke a man out of his wits, who would confesse, that
two testers make a shilling, and denie that sixe peeces of two pence a peece, or tvvelue
single pence do likewise make a shilling. Yet we will confesse that fiue semibriefes to
one is Quintupla. But we will not confesse that ten minimes, being the value of fiue semibriefes,
compared to one semibriefe, is likewise Quintupla: and so in Quadrupla, sextupla,
septupla, and others. Then commeth the common measure, or the lesse prolation
(the signe of Subquintupla thus 15. destroying the proportion) for which the base singeth
septupla, but as it is set downe in the first waie, it is as it were not septupla, but Supartripartiens,
Quartas, or 74. Therefore I set them all downe in semibriefes, allowing
seuen of them to a stroke: which ended commeth equalitie after which followeth true
Dupla in the more prolation, which we sometime call Sextupla, and sometime Tripla.
After which and last of all commeth equalitie.
            And lette this suffice for your instruction in singing, for I am perswaded that except
practise you lacke nothing, to make you a perfect and sure singer.

               Here be some following of two parts, which I haue made of purpose, that when
you haue any friend to sing with you, you may practise togither, which wil sooner make
you perfect then if you should studie neuer so much by your selfe.

               Sir I thanke you, and meane so diligentlie to practise till our nexte meeting,
that then I thinke I shall be able to render you a full account of all which you haue told
me: till which time I wish you such contentment of minde, and ease of bodie as you
desire to your selfe, or mothers vse to wish to their children.

               I thanke you: and assure your selfe it will not be the smallest part of my contentment,
to see my schollers go towardlie forward in their studies,
which I doubt not but you will doe, if you take but
reasonable paines in practise.

At the second time you must sing it as it standeth, going forwarde without any respect to the close. When you come to the end & find the signe of repetition before the finall close, you must sing the note befor the signe as it standeth and then begin againe at the place where the stroke parteth all the lines, & so sing to the finall close. But if you find any song of this kinde without the stroke so parting all the lines, you must begin at the first signe of repetition, & so sing to the end, for in this maner (for sauing of labor in pricking them at lēgth) do they prick all their ayres & villanellaes.

               Maister.
               
                  WHom do I see a far off: is it not my scholler Philomates?
out of doubt it is he, and therefore I wil salute
him. Good morrow scholler.
            
            
               Phi.
               God giue you good morrow, and a hundreth:
but I maruayle not a little to see you so
early, not only stirring, but out of doores also.
            
            
               Ma.
               It is no maruayle to see a Snayle after a
Rayne to creep out of his shell, and wander all about,
seeking the moysture.
            
            
               Phi.
               I pray you talke not so darkely, but let me
vnderstand your comparyson playnely.
            
            
               Ma.
               Then in playne tearmes, being ouerwearied
with study, and taking the oportunitie
of the fayre morning: I am come to this place to
snatch a mouthful of this holsome ayre: which gently breathing vpon these sweet smelling
flowers, and making a whispering noyse amongst these tender leaues, delighteth
with refreshing, and refresheth with delight my ouer-wearied sences. But tel me I pray
you the cause of your hither comming; haue you not forgotten some part of that which
I shewed you at our last being togither?
            
            
               Phi.
               No verily, but by the contrary, I am become such a singer as you would wonder
to heare me.
            
            
               Ma.
               How came that to passe?
            
            
               Phi.
               Be silent and I will shew you. I haue a Brother a great scholler, and a reasonable
musition for singing: he, at my first comming to you conceiued an opinion (I know not
vpon what reason grounded,) that I should neuer come to any meane knowledge in
musicke; and therefore, when he heard me practise alone, he would continually mock
me; indeede not without reason, for many times I would sing halfe a note too high,
other while as much too lowe; so that he could not conteyne himselfe from laughing:
yet now and then he would set me right, more to let mee see that he could doe it, then
that he ment any way to instruct me: which caused me so diligently to apply my pricksong
booke; that in a manner, I did no other thing but sing practising, to skip from one
key to another, from flat to sharp, from sharp to flat, from any one place in the Scale
to āother, so that there was no song so hard, but I would venture vpon it, no Mood nor

Proportion so strange, but I would goe through and sing perfectly before I left it: and
in the ende I came to such perfection, that I might haue been my brothers maister: for
although he had a little more practise to sing at first sight then I had: yet for the Moods
Ligatures, and other such things I might set him to schoole.
            
            
               Ma.
               What then was the cause of your comming hither at this time?
            
            
               Phi.
               Desire to learne, as before.
            
            
               Ma.
               What would you now learne?
            
            
               Phi.
               Beeing this last daye vpon occasion of some businesse at one of my friends houses,
we had some songs sung: Afterwards falling to discourse of musicke and musitions,
one of the company naming a friend of his owne, tearmed him the best Descanter that
was to bee found. Now sir, I am at this time come to know what Descant is, and to
learne the same.
            
            
               Ma.
               I thought you had onely sought to know Pricktsong, whereby to recreate your
selfe being wearie of other studies.
            
            
               Pbi.
               In deed when I came to you first, I was of that minde: but the common Prouerb
is in me verified, that much would haue more: And seeing I haue so farre set foote in musicke,
I doe not meane to goe backe till I haue gone quite through al, therefore I pray
you now, (seeing the time and place fitteth so well) to discourse to me what Descant is,
what parts, and how many it hath, and the rest.
            
            
               Ma.
               The heate increaseth, and that which you demand requireth longer discourse
then you looke for.Exposition of the name of Descant. Let vs therefore goe and sit in yonder shadie Arbor to auoyde the
vehementnesse of the Sunne. The name of Descant is vsurped of the musitions in diuers
significations: some time they take it for the whole harmony of many voyces: others
sometime for one of the voyces or partes: & that is, when the whole song is not passing
three voyces. Last of all, they take it for singing a part extempore vpon a playnesong, in
which sence we commonly vse it: so that when a man talketh of a Descanter, it must be
vnderstood of one that can extempore sing a part vpon a playne song.
            
            
               Phi.
               What is the meane to sing vpon a playne song.

               It is a mixt sound compact of diuers voyces, entring with delight in the eare, and is
eyther perfect or vnperfect.

               Ma.
               Those notes which are distant from them eight notes, as from an vnison, an eight,
from a fift, a twelfe.
            
            
               Phi.
               I pray you make mee vnderstand that, for in common sence it appeareth against
reason: for put Eight to One, and all will be Nine, put Eight to Fiue, and all will bee
Thirteene.
            
            
               Ma.
               I see you doe notconceiue my meaning in reckoning your distances, for you
vnderstood me exclusiuely, and I meant inclusiuely: as for example. From Gam ut to b my
is a third: for both the extremes are taken, so from Gam vt to G solre ut is an eight, and
from Gam ut to D lasolre is a twelfe, although it seeme in common sence but an a
Leuenth.
            
            
               
               Phi.
               Go forward with your discourse, for I vnderstand you now.
            
            
               Ma.
               Then I faie, a vnison, a fift, an eight, a twelfth, a fifteenth, a nineteenth, and so
forth in infinitum, be perfect cordes.

               The first waie wherein we shew the vse of the cords, is called Counterpoint:
that is, when to a note of the plainsong, there goeth but one note of descant. Therfore
when you would sing vpon a plainsong, looke where the first note of it stands, and then
sing another for it which may bee distant from it, three, fiue, or eight notes, and so foorth
with others, but with a sixt we sildome begin or end.

               Yes.

                  If you be in the vnison, fift, or eight, from your base or plainsong, if the base rise or
fall, you must not rise and fall iust as manie notes as your base did.

               Phi.
               This is easie to be decerned as it is set downe now: but it will not
be so easy to be perceiued when they be mingled with other notes. Therfore
I praie you shew me how they may bee perceiued amongste other

               There is no waie to discerne them, but by diligent marking wherin
euerie note standeth, which you cannot doe but by continuall practise,
and so by marking where the notes stand, and how farre euerie one
is from the next before, you shall easilie know, both what cordes they be, and also what
corde commeth next.

               I praie you explane this likewise by an example.

therfore (if you can) shew me now what concord euerie note is, & which

               Phi.
               The first note of the base, standeth in C solfavt, and the first of the
treble in G sol re vt: so that they two make a Fift, and therfore the first note 
                     〈♫〉
                  
is true. The second note of the base standeth in A la mire, and the second
of the treble in E la mi, which two make also a fifth, and were true if
the base did not fall two notes, and the treble likewise two notes from the
place where they were before. The third note is true, and the last false.
            
            
               Ma.
               You haue conceiued verie well, and this is the meaning of the rule which saieth,
that you must not rise nor fall with two perfect cordes togither.

               Ma.
               This is well being your first proofe, But it is not good to fall so from the eight to the
vnison as you haue done in your first two notes:Falling from the eight to the vnison condemned. for admit, I should for my pleasure descend
in the plainsong from G sol re ut, to C fa ut, then would your descant be two eights:
and whereas in your seuenth and eighth notes you fall from a sixt to an vnison, it is indeed
true, but not allowed in two parts either ascending or descending, but worse ascending
then discending:Falling from a sixt to a vnison condemned in two partes. for descending it commeth to an eight, which is much better,
and hath farre more fulnesse of sound then the vnison hath. Indeed, in manie parts
vpon an extremitie, or for the point (or fuge) sake thus,
or in Canon it were tollerable, but most chieflie in Canon, the 
                     〈♫〉
                  
reason whereof you shall know hereafter, when you haue learned
what a Canon is. In the meane time let vs goe forvvarde
with the rest of your lesson. In your last two notes, the comming
from a sixt to a third is altogither not to be suffered in this place, 
                     〈♫〉
                  
but if it were in the middle of a song,Falling from sixt to a third both parts dcending disalowed. and then your B fa b mi being
flat, it were not onelie sufferable but commendable: but to
come from F fa vt (which of his nature is alwaies flat) to B fab
mi sharpe, it is against nature. But if you would in this place make a flat close to your
last note, and so thinke to auoide the fault that could no more bee suffered then the other:
for no close may be flat, but if you had made your waie thus, it hadde beene much
better.

               For the fewer partes your song is of, the more exquisite shoulde descant bee, and of moste
choise cordes, especiallie sixtes and tenthes: perfect cordes are not so much to be vsed in
two partes, except passing (that is when one part descendeth and another ascendeth)
or at a close or beginning.
            
            
               Phi.
               Indeed me thinkes this filleth mine eares better then mine owne did, but I pray
you how do you make your last note sauing two to stand in the harmonie, seeing it is a
discord.
            
            
               Ma.
               
                  Discords mingled with concordes not onelie are tollerable,
                  Discords wel taken allowed in musicke. 
                  but make the descant
more pleasing if they be well taken. Moreouer, there is no comming to a close, speciallie
with a Cadence without a discord, and that most commonly a seuenth bound in with a
sixth when your plainsong descendeth, as it doth in that example I shewed you before.
            
            
               Phi.
               What do you tearme a Cadence?
               
            
            
               Ma.
               A Cadence wee call that, when comming to a close, two notes
are bound togither,What a Cadence is. and the following note descendeth thus:
or in any other keye after the same manner.

               I praie you then shewe mee some waies of taking a Discord well,
and also some, where they are not well taken: that comparing the good with the badd,
I may the more easily conceiue the nature of both.

                  And whereas in the first of these examples you begin to bynde
vpon the sixt, the like you might haue done vpon the eight: or in
the fift, if your playnesong had risen thus.

               The second of these examples closeth in the fift, and

               It is tolerable though not so good in the eare, as that
before which closeth in the eight, or that which next followeth

                  Because after the Discord we do not set a perfect concord
for the perfect concordes doe not so well beare out
the discords as the vnperfect doe, and the reason is this. When a discord is taken, it is
to cause the note following be the more pleasing to the eare. Now the perfect Concords
of them selues being sufficiently pleasing, neede no helpe to make them more agreeable,
because they can be no more then of themselues they were before.

               We will, and therefore as I haue told you of the good and bad taking of a discord

               You liue in a good opinion of your selfe,
but let vs examine your example. This is in deed
better then your first:Faults in this lesson What hitting the eight on the face is. But marke wherein I condemne
it. In the first and second notes you rise as
though it were a close, causing a great informalitie of closing, when you shoulde but
begin. Your third note is good: your fourh note is tollerable, but in that you goe from
it to the twefth, it maketh it vnpleasing, and that we commonly call hitting the eight on
the face, when we come to an eight, and skip vp from it agayne to another perfect
concord: But if it had beene meeting one another, the playnesong ascending, and the
Descecant desending: it had bin very good thus: 
                     〈♫〉
                  
But I pray you where was your memorie when you set downe this
sixt note.Consequence of vnperfect. Fifts no more to be vsed then of perfect.
               
            
            
               Phi.
               I set it so of purpose, not of negligence.
            
            
               Ma.
               And I pray you what reason moued you therevnto?

               Where in doe you condemne it?
            
            
               Ma.
               For two twelfes or fifts, which was one of the principall caueats
I gaue you to be auoyded.
            
            
               Phi.
               But they be not two fifts.
            
            
               Ma.
               No, what reason haue you to the contrary?
            
            
               Phi.
               Because in singing I was taught that the sharp cliff taketh away half of his sound
so that it cannot be properly called a fift.
            
            
               Ma.
               That is a new opinion. But I trust you will not say it is a fourth.
            
            
               Phi.
               No.

               Because it hath halfe a note more then any fourth hath.
            
            
               Ma.
               and I hope you will not tearme it a sixt.

               No.
            
            
               Ma.
               Then if it be no fourth, because it is more then a fourth, nor a sixt because it is
lesse then a sixt, what name will you gine it?
            
            
               Phi.
               I cannot tell.

               A womans reason to maintayne an oppinion,
                     Alfonso in his song Si ch'io mi cred ho mai being the twentieth song of his second book of Madrigals of fiue voyces at the very close betweene Canto & Alto
                   and then if she be asked why she
doth so, will answere, because I doe so. In deed I haue seene the like committed by maister
Alfonso agreat musition, famous and admired for his works amongst the best: but
his fault was onely in pricking, for breaking a note in deuision, not looking to the rest of
the parts, made three fifts in the same order as you did. But yours came of ignorance,
his of Iolitie, and I my selfe haue committed the like fault in my first workes of three
parts, (yet if any one should reason with me) I weare not able to defend it: but (no shame
to confesse;) my fault came by negligence▪ But if I had seene it before it came
to the presse, it should not haue passed so, for I doe vtterly condemne it as being expresly
against the principles of our art:In the third part but of this another time at more length.
               And as for the rest of your lesson, though the cords be true, yet I much mislike the
forme, for falling down so in tenths so long to gether is odius, seeing you haue so much

shift otherwise. Likewise in your penult and antepenult notes, you stande still with your
descant,Standing with the plainesong condemned. What formalitie is. the plainsong standing still, which is a fault not to be suffered in so fewe as two
partes, especiallie in eightes. But in descanting you must not onelie seeke true cordes,
but formalitie also: that is, to make your descant carrie some forme of relation to the
plaine song, as thus for example.
            
            
               Phi.
               You sing two plainesong notes for one in

haue done, except at a close.

bee not too much vsed in one song, and it is
commonlie called binding descant, but to instruct
you somewhat more in formalitie, the
chiefest point in it is singing with a point or Fuge.
               
            
            
               Phi.

               We call that a Fuge, when one part beginneth 
                     〈♫〉
                  
and the other singeth the same, for some
number of notes (which the first did sing) as thus
for example:
            
            
               Phi.
               If I might play the zoilus with you in this

               Ma.
               I pray you let me heare what you can saie
against any part of it, for I would be glad that you could not onely spie an ouersight, but
that you could make one much better.
            
            
               Phi.
               First of all, you let the plainsong sing twoe whole notes, for which you sing nothing:
secondlie you begin on a sixt.
            
            
               Ma.
               You haue the eies of a Lynx, in spying faults in my lesson, and I praie God you
may bee so circumspect in your owne: but one answer solueth both these obiections
which you laie against me. And first for the rest, there can bee no point or Fuge taken
without a rest,No fuge can be brought in without a rest. Beginning vpō a sixt in a fuge tollerable. and in this place, it is vnpossible in counterpoint sooner to come in with
the point in the eight: and as for the beginning vpon a sixt, the point likewise compelled
me to do so, although I could haue made
the descant begin it otherwise, as thus 
                     〈♫〉
                  
for auoiding of the sixt, altering the leading
part, but then woulde not your point haue
gone through to the ende, answering to euerie
note of the plainesong, for that the 
                     〈♫〉
                  
ninth note of force must be a fourth as you
see. But if you would sing the descant part
fifteene notes lower, then will it goe wel in
the eight below the plainesong, and that note 
                     〈♫〉
                  
which aboue was a fourth, will fall to be a fift
vnder the plainsong thus:
the point likewise doeth excuse all the rest of
the faults which might be obiected againste 
                     〈♫〉

               Phi.
               You haue giuen me a competent reason,
and therfore I pray you shew me, in what and how many distances you may begin
your point.
            
            
               Ma.

that when we speake of a Fuge or Canon,How those distances are reckoned. in the vnison, fift, or eight: it is to bee vnderstood,
from the first note of the leading part, as my lesson may be called two parts in one
in the eighth, although I did begin vpon a sixt.
            
            
               Phi.
               Well then, seeing by your wordes I conceiue the formalitie of following a point
with a plainsong, I will trie vpon the same plainsong what I can doe, for the maintenāce
of this Fuge▪ But now that I haue seene it, I thinke it impossible to finde anie other way
then that which you alreadie haue set downe on these notes.
            
            
               Ma.
               Yes there is another waie if you can finde it out.
            
            
               Phi.
               I shall neuer leaue breaking my braines til I finde it. And loe, here is a waie which
although it do not driue the point quite through as yours did, yet I thinke it formall.
            
            
               Ma.
               You haue rightlie conceiued the waie 
                     〈♫〉
                  
which I meant. But whie did you pricke it of
so much compasse?
            
            
               Phi.
               For auoiding the vnison in the beginning.

               Ma.
               It is well, and verie hard and almost impossible
to doe more for the bringing in of this
point aboue the plainsong then you haue don.
Wherefore I commend you, in that you haue
studied so earnestlie for it, but can you doe it no otherwise?
            
            
               Phi.
               No in truth, for while I studied to doe that I did, I thought I shoulde haue gone
madde, with casting and deuising, so that I thinke it impossible to set anie otherwaie.
            
            
               Ma.
               Take the descant of your own waie, which was in the eleuenth, or fourth aboue
and sing it as you did begin (but in the fift belowe vnder the plainesong) and it will in a

                     〈♫〉
                   manner go through to the end, whereas yours
did keepe report but for fiue notes,
            
            
               Phi.
               This riseth fiue notes and the plainsong
riseth but foure.
            
            
               Ma.
               So did you in your example before, although

                     〈♫〉
                   you could perceiue it in mine, and not
in your owne: but although it rise fiue notes, yet
is it the point.Rising from the fift to the eight disalowed in musicke. For if it were in Canon, we might not rise one note higher, nor descende
one note lower then the plainsong did: but in Fuges wee are not so straightlie bounde.
But there is a worse fault in it which you haue not espied, which is, the rising from the
fift to the eight in the seuenth and eight notes, but the point excuseth it, although it be
not allowed for anie of the best in two parts, but in mo parts it might be suffered.
            
            
               Phi.
               I would not haue thought there had bin such varietie to be vsed vpon so few notes.
            
            
               Ma.
               There be manie things which happen contrarie to mens expectation, therfore
yet once againe, trie what you can do vpon this plainsong, though not with a point, yet
with some formalitie or meaning in your waie.
            
            
               Phi.
               You vse me as those who ride the great horses: for hauing first ridden them in a

of Fuge, I shal find you a robber. For
behold here bee all your owne notes in

below, yet is the descant all one.

               I like it al the better. But I would counsel you, that you accustome not your selfe

go anie further.Short and long The first is called short and long, when we make one note alone, & then

                   if you can otherwise do anie thing vpon a plaine-song,
this wil not bee hard for you, but to doe it
twise or thrice vppon one plainesong in seuerall
waies, wil bee somewhat harder, because that in
these waies there is little shift.

               Necessitie hath no law, and therefore a

               What followeth next to be spoken of?
            
            
               Ma.
               The making of twoe or more notes for
one of the plainsong,Descant commonlie called Dupla. which as (as I tolde you
before) is falslie termed dupla, and is, when a semibriefe or note of the plainsong, wee
make two minimes.
            
            
               Phi.
               May you not now and then intermingle some crotchets.
            
            
               Ma.
               Yes as manie as you list, so you doe not make al crotchets.
            
            
               Phi.
               Then I thinke it is no more dupla.
               
            
            
               Ma.
               You saie true, although it should seem
that this kind of dupla is deriued from the true dupla, and the common quadrupla out of
this. But to talke of these proportions is in this place out of purpose: therefore we will
leaue them and return to the matter we haue in hand.

               The rules of your cordes, beginning, formalitie, and such like are the same which
you had in counterpoint, yet by the waie, one caueat more I must giue you to bee obserued

here, that is, that you take not a discord for the first part of your note, except it
be in binding maner, but for the last part you may.

               The first, second, and thirde-notes of your lesson are tollerable, but your fourth
note is not to be suffered, because that and the next note following are two eights.
            
            
               Phi.
               The second part of the note is a Discord, and therefore it cannot be two eights
seeing they are not both togither.
            
            
               Ma.
               Though they be not both together,A discord comming betweene two perfect cords of one kinde, taketh not awaie the faulty consequence. yet is there no concord betweene them: &
this you must marke, that a Discord comming betweene two eights, doth not let them to be
two eightes stil. Likewise, if you set a discord betweene two fifts, it letteth them not to bee
two fifts still. Therfore if you will auoide the consequence of perfect cords of one kind,
you must put betwixt them other concords, and not discords.
            
            
               Phi.
               This is more then I would haue belieued, if another had told it me, but I praie

               Your seuenth and eighth notes haue a fault, cosine germaine to that which the

               Phi.
               I am sure you cannot saie that they be two eightes, for there is a tenth after the

               Yet it is verie naught,Ascending or descending to the eight condemned. to ascend or descend in that maner to the eight, for those
foure crotchets bee but the breaking off a semibriefe in G sol re ut, which if it were sung
whole, would make two eights togither ascending, or if he who singeth the plainsong
would breake it thus,Zarlim inst. mus. part terza cap. 48.

it would make fiue eightes togither: and as it is, it ought not to be
vsed, especiallie, in two partes: for it is a grosse fault. Your ninth & tenth
notes, are two eightes with the plainsong, for a minime rest set betwixt two eights, keepeth
them not from being two eights, because as I saide before, there commeth no other
concord betwixt them:A minime rest put betwixt two perfect cordes of one kind, hindreth not their faultie consequēce but if it were a semibriefe rest, then were it tollerable in more
partes, though not in two, for it is an vnartificiall kinde of descanting in the middle of
a lesson, to let the plainsong sing alone, except it were for the bringing in or maintaining
of a point praecedent.

after the first. Your fift, sixt, and seuenth notes be wilde and vnformall, for that vnformall
skipping is condemned in this kinde of singing,Wild skipping condemned in descant. but if you had made it thus

other twoe, there is no waie of well taking
a discord, lacking, both for Fuge,
and for binding descant, in that it is vnpossible
to take them trulie on this plainesong, otherwise then I haue set them downe
for you, for in them be all the allowances: and besides, the first of them singeth euerie
note of the plainsong.
            
            
               Phi.
               I thanke you hartilie for them, and I meane by the grace of God, to keepe them
so in memorie, that whensoeuer I haue any vse of them I, may haue them readie.

               Phi.
               Here is one, although I be doubtfull how to thinke of it my selfe, and therefore
I long to heare your opinion.

                     〈♫〉

               Ma.
               My opinion is that the halfe of it is tollerable, the other halfe I mislike.
            
            
               Phi.
               I suspected so much before, that the latter halfe woulde please you, though the
first halfe did not.
            
            
               Ma.
               You are deceiued, for the first halfe liketh me better then the latter.
            
            
               Phi.
               How can that be,Falling downe with the plain song disalowed seeing the latter keepeth point in some sort with the plainsong.
            
            
               Ma.
               But you fall as the plainsong dooeth, still telling one tale with out varietie. But if
you would maintaine a point, you must go to worke thus:

                     〈♫〉
                  
                  
                     〈♫〉
                  
But withall you must take this caueat, that you take no note aboue one Minime rest, or
three vpon the greatest extremitie of your point in two partes (for that in long resting,
the harmonie seemeth bare) and the odde rest giueth an vnspeakable grace to the point
(as for an euen number of restes,An od rest the most artificiall kind of bringing in a point. few or none vse them in this kinde of descanting) but
it is supposed, that when a man keepeth long silence, and then beginneth to speake, he
will speake to the purpose so in resting, you let the other goe before, that you may the
better follow him at your ease and pleasure.
            
            
               Phi.
               Here is a waie which I haue beaten out, wherein I haue done what I coulde to
maintaine the point.
            
            
               Ma.
               You haue maintained 
                     〈♫〉
                  
your point indeed,
but after such a manner, as
no bodie will commend: 
                     〈♫〉
                  
for the latter halfe of your
lesson is the same that
your firste was, without
any alteration, sauing that to make it fill vppe the whole time of the plainesong (which
hath two notes more then were before) you haue set it downe in longer notes.One thinge twice sung in one lesson condemned. But by
casting awaie those two notes from the plainsong, you may sing your first halfe tvvice
after one manner, as in this example you may see.
               And therefore though this

                     〈♫〉
                   waie bee true, yet woulde I
haue you to abstain from the
vse of it, because in so small
boundes and short space it is

                     〈♫〉
                   odious to repeate one thing
twise.
            
            
               Phi.
               Wel then, I will remember
not to take the same
descant twice in one lesson, but when I made it, I did not looke into it so narrowlie: yet
I thinke by these waies I doe well enough vnderstand the nature of this kind of descant,
therefore proceed to that which you thinke most meet to be learned next.
            
            
               
               Ma.
               Before you proceed to any other thing, I would haue you make some more lessons
in this kinde, that you may thereby be the more readie in the practise of your precepts:
for that this waie of maintaining a point or Fuge, commeth as much by vse as
by rule.
            
            
               Phi.
               I may at all times make waies enough, seeing I haue the order how to do them,
and know the most faults which are to be shunned: therefore if you please, I praie proceed
to some other matter, which you thinke most requisite.
            
            
               Ma.
               Now seeing (as you saie) you vnderstand this kind of descant,What a reuert is. and knowe how
to follow or maintaine a point, it followeth to learne how to reuert it.
            
            
               Phi.
               What doe you call the reuerting of a point?
            
            
               Ma.
               The reuerting of a point (which also we terme a reuert) is, when a point is made
rising or falling, and then turned to go the contrarie waie, as manie notes as it did ye first.
            
            
               Phi.
               That would be better vnderstood by an example then by wordes, and therefore
I praie you giue me one.
            
            
               Ma.
               Here is one, marke it well, and studie to imitate it:

               Phi.
               This waie argueth maistrie, and in my opinion hee who can doe it at the firste
sight, needeth not to stand telling his cordes.
            
            
               Ma.
               That is true indeed, but doe you see how the point is reuerted?
            
            
               Phi.
               Yes verie well, for from your first note till the middle of your fift, your point is
contained; and then in the middle of your fift note you reuert it, causing it ascende as
manie notes as it descended before, and so descend where it ascended before.
            
            
               Ma.
               You haue well perceiued the true making of this waie, but I praie make one of
your owne, that your practise may stretch as farre as your speculation.
            
            
               Phi.
               Lo here is one, How doe you like it?

                     〈♫〉

               Ma.
               I thinke it is fatal to you, to haue these wild points of vnformal skippings (which
I pray you learne to leaue) otherwaies your first fiue notes be tollerable, in your fift note
you begin your reuert well:Falling from the sixt to the eight condemned. but in your seuenth and eight notes, you fall from the thirteenth
or sixt, to the eight or vnison, which was one of the faults I condemned, in your
first lesson of Counterpoint: the rest of your descant is passable. But I must admonishe
you, that in making reuerts, you choose such points as may be easilie driuen thorough
to the ende, without wresting, changing of notes, or pointes in harsh cords, which can
not be done perfectlie well, without great foresight of the notes which are to come after.
Therefore I would wish you, before you set downe anie point, diligentlie to consider

your plainsong, to see what pointes will aptliest agree with the nature of it, for that
vpon one ground or plainesong, innumerable waies may bee made, but manie better
then other.
            
            
               Phi.
               Then for a triall that I haue rightlie conceiued your meaning, I wil make another
waie reuerted, that then we may go forward with other matters.
            
            
               Ma.
               Do so, but take heed of forgetting your rules.
            
            
               Phi.
               I am in a better opinion of the goodnesse of mine owne memorie, then to doe
so. but I praie you peruse this waie, if there be in it anie sensible grosse fault, shew it me.

                     〈♫〉

               Ma.
               All this is sufferable, except your seuenth and eight notes, wherein you falfrom
B fa b mi to F fa vt, and so vnformallie to B fa b mi backe againe, thus: 
                     〈♫〉
                  
which though it be better then that which I condemned in the Close
of your firste lesson of Counterpoint yet is it of the same nature and

                     〈♫〉
                   naught, but you may in continuall deduction, ascend from mi to fa thus.
I know you will make the point your excuse,Falling from B fa b mi sharp to F fa vt condemned. but (as I tolde you before)
I would rather haue begun againe and taken a new point, then I woulde
haue committed so grosse a fault: as for the rest of your lesson it is tollerable. Nowe I
hope by the precepts which I haue alreadie giuen you, in your examples going before,
you may conceiue the nature of treble descant, it followeth to shewe you how to make
base descant.
            
            
               Phi.
               What is Base descant?
               
            
            
               Ma.
               
                  It is that kinde of descanting,Base descant. where your sight of taking and vsing your cordes must
be vnder the plainsong.
            
            
               Phi.
               What rules are to be obserued in base descant?
            
            
               Ma.
               The same which were in treble descant, but you must take heed that your cords
deceiue you not, for that which aboue your plainsong was a third, will bee vnder your
plainsong a sixt: and that which aboue your plainsong was a fourth, wil bee vnder your
plainsong a fift: and which aboue was a fift, will vnder the plainsong be a fourth: and
lastlie,A caueat for the sight of cords vnder the plainsong. that which aboue your plainsong was a sixt, will vnder it be a third. And so likewise
in your discords, that which aboue your plainsong was a second, will be vnder it a
seuenth: and that which aboue the plainsong was a seuenth, wil be vnder the plainsong
a second.
            
            
               Phi.
               But in descanting I was taught to reckon my cords from the plainsong or ground.
            
            
               Ma.
               That is true: but in base descant the base is the ground, although wee are bound
to see it vpon the plainsong: for your plainsong is as it were your theme, and your descant
(either base or treble) as it were your declamation, and either you may reckon
your cordes from your base vpwardes, or from the plainesong downewarde, which
you list. For as it is twentie miles by account from London to ware, so is it twenty from
Ware to London.
            
            
               Phi.
               I praie you set me an example of base descant.

               Here it is, and I thinke it shall need but little correction.

               I will: but wherein doe you condemne my waie?
            
            
               Ma.
               In those thinges wherein I did not thinke you should haue erred.A discord takē for the first part of a note not in binding wise cōdemned For in the beginning
of your fourth note, you take a discord for the first part, & not in binding wise:
your other faults are not so grosse, and yet must they be told.
            
            
               Phi.
               In what notes be they?
            
            
               Ma.
               In the foure notes going before the close, for there your descant woulde haue
beene more stirring, and by reason it hangs so much, I do not, nor cannot greatly commend
it, although it be true in the cordes.
            
            
               Phi.
               What? Is not that binding descant good?
            
            
               Ma.
               That kind of binding with concords is not so good as those bindinges which
are mixt with discordes:Binding with concords not so good as that with discords. but here is your own waie with a little alteration much better.

               This is the course of the world, that where we thinke our selues surest, there are

God knowes the least part of that which we know not, is more then al we know. Therefore
I praie you yet set me another example, that considering it with your other, I may

plainsong being flat) is from it selfe, when the plainsong is sharpe. And therefore, because
I thought it better flat then sharpe, I haue set it flat. But if anie man like the other
waie better, let him vse his discretion.

               I perceiue by this waie, that if you will bee carefull and practise, censuring your
owne dooinges with iudgement, you neede few more instructions for these waies: therfore
my counsell is, that when you haue made any thinge, you peruse it, and correct it
the second and third time before you leaue it. But now seeing you knowe the rules of
singing one part aboue or vnder the plainsong: it followeth, to shew you how to make
more partes. But before we come to that, I must shew you those thinges which of olde
were taught, before they can sing two partes: and it shall be enough to set you a waie
of euerie one of them, that you may see the maner of making of them, for the alowances
and descanting be the same which were before: so that he who can doe that which
you haue alreadie done, may easilie do them all. The first is called crotchet, minime,

                   following, not according as it ought to bee in reason,
but to content wranglers, who I know will at euerie little ouersight,
take occasion to backbire, and detract from that which
they cannot disproue. I know they will excuse themselues with that new inuention of
Tripla to the semibriefe, and tripla to the minime, and that that kinde of tripla which is
tripla to the minime, must be prickt in minimes, and the other in semibriefes. But in
that inuention they ouershoote themselues, seeing it is grounded vpon custome, & not
vpon reason. They wil replie and saie, the Italians haue vsed it: that I graunt, but not in
that order as we doe: For when they marke tripla of three minimes for a stroke, they
doe most vsuallie set these numbers before it 52: which is the true marking of Sesqui altera,
and these three minimes are true sesqui altra it selfe. But you shall neuer find in anie
of their workes a minime set downe for the time of a blacke semibriefe and a Crotchet,
or three blacke minimes, which all our Composers both for voices and instruments
doe most commonlie vse. It is true that Zaccone in the second book & 38. chapter
of practise of musicke, doth allow a minime for a stroke in the more prolation, and

prooueth it out of Palestina, but that is not when the song is marked with proportionate
numbers: but when all the partes haue the lesse prolation, and one onelie part hath the
more,In the first part in which case the part so marked, containeth Augmentation as I saide before:
and so is euerie minime of the more prolation worth a semibriefe of the lesse. But let
euerie one vse his discretion, it is enough for me to let you see that I haue saide nothing
without reason, and that it hath beene no small tolle for me to seeke out the authorities
of so manie famous and excellent men, for the confirmation of that, which some will
thinke scarce worth the making mention of. Quadrupla and Quintupla, they denominated

               It is no hard matter, for you are not tied when your base singeth a semibriefe or
anie other note to sing one of the same length, but you may breake your notes at your
pleasure and sing what you list, so it be in true cordes to the other two partes: but especiallie
fiftes and thirds intermingled with sixes, which of all other bee the sweetest and
most fit for three partes. For in foure or fiue parts you must haue more scope, because
there be more partes to be supplied. And therefore the eight must of force be the oftener
vsed.

               Yes there is shift enough: but whie did you stand still with your last note also?
seeing there was no necessitie in that.Manie perfect cords togither condemned. For it had beene much better to haue come down

and confer with my last going before) whereby you may learne to haue some meaning
in your parts to make them answer in Fuge. For if you examine wel mine other going
before, you shall see how the beginning of the treble leadeth the base, and howe in the
third note the base leadeth the treble in the fourth note, and how the beginning of the
ninth note of the base, leadeth the treble in the same note and next following.
            
            
               Phi.
               I perceiue all that, and now will I examine this which you haue set downe. In
your treble you followe the Fuge of the plainsong. But I praie you what reason moued
you to take a discord for the first part of your fourth note (which is the seconde of the
treble) and then to take a sharpe for the latter halfe, your note being flat.
            
            
               Ma.
               As for the discord it is taken in binding manner,In what maner a sharpe, for a flat is alowable in the fift. and as for the sharpe in the base
for the flat in the treble, the base being a Cadence, the nature thereof requireth a sharp,
and yet let your eares (or whose soeuer else) be iudge, sing it and you wil like the sharpe
much better then the flat in my opinion. Yet this youe must marke by the waie, that
though this be good in halfe a note as here you see, yet is it intollerable in whole semibriefes.
            
            
               Phi.
               This obseruation is necessarie to be knowne, but as for the rest of your lesson, I
see how one part leadeth after another: therefore I will set downe a waie which I praie
you censure.
            
            
               Ma.
               I doe not vse when I find anie faultes in your lessons to leaue them vntold, and

which you your selfe might haue made much better, if you had beene attentiue to your

harsh musicke: and though it hath much pleased diuers of our descanters in times
past, and beene receiued as currant amongst others of later time: yet hath it euer beene
condemned of the most skilfull here in England, and scoffed at amongst strangers. For
as they saie, there can be nothing falser (and their opinion seemeth to me to be grounded
vpon good reason) how euer it contenteth others. It followeth nowe to speake of

I haue likewise set downe the plainesong, that you may perceiue the breaking of euerie
note,Great maisteries vpon a plainsong not the sweetest musicke. and not that you should sing it for a part with the rest: for the rest are made out
of it and not vppon it. And as concerning the descanting, although I cannot commend
it for the best in the musicke, yet is it praise worthie, and though in some places
it be harsh to the eare, yet is it more tollerable in this waie, then in two partes in one
vpon a plainsong, because that vpon a plainsong there is more shift then in this kind.
            
            
               Phi.
               I perceiue that this example will serue me to more purpose hereafter, if I shall
come to trie maisteries, then at this time to learne descant. Therefore I will passe it, &
praie you to go forward with your begun purpose of twoe partes in one, the definition
whereof I haue had before.
            
            
               Ma.
               Then it followeth to declare the kindes thereof, which wee distinguish no other
waies, then by the distance of the first note of the following part, from the first of the
leading which if it be a fourth, the song or Canon is called two partes in one in ye fourth
if a Fift, in the fift, and so foorth in other distances. But if the Canon bee in the eight,
of these, as in the tenth, twelfth, or so, then commonlie is the plainesong in the middle
betwixt the leading and following part▪ yet is not that rule so generall, but that you
may set the plainsong either aboue or below at your pleasure. And because he who can
perfectlie make two partes vpon a plainsong, may the more easier binde himselfe to a
rule when he list, I will onlie set you downe an example of the most vsual waies that you
may by your selfe put them in practise.

               No verelie, in that the forme of making the Canons is so manie and diuers waies
altered, that no generall rule may be gathered: yet in the making of two parts in one in
the fourth,A note for two parts in one in the fourth. if you would haue your following part in the waie of counterpoint to follow
within one note after the other, you must not ascend two, nor descend three. But if you
descend two, aud ascend three, it wil be well: as in this example (which because you
should the better conceiue, I haue set downe both plaine and deuided) you may see.

is by rising and falling▪ for when the higher part ascendeth, the lower part descendeth,

I thought good to set downe a waie made by M. Bird, which for difficultie in the composition
is not inferior to anie which I haue seene: for it is both made per arsin & thesin, and likewise
the point or Fuge is reuerted, note for note: which thing, how hard it is to performe vpon
a plainsong, none can perfectlie know, but hee who hath or shal go about to doe the like. And
to speake vprightlie, I take the plainsong to bee made with the descant, for the more easie effecting
of his purpose. But in my opinion, who soeuer shal go about to make such another, vpon
anie common knowne plainesong or hymne, shal find more difficultie then he looked for.
And although hee shoulde assaie twentie seueral hymnes or plainsonges for finding of one to
his purpose, I doubt if hee should any waie goe beyond the excellencie of the composition of
this, and therefore I haue set it downe in partition.

part: vvhich vse manie times caused diuers good Musicians sitte a vvhole daie, to
find out the follovving part of a Canon:
               A compendious way of pricking of canons. which being founde (it might bee) was scant
worth the hearing. But the French men and Italians, haue vsed a waie that thogh there
were foure or fiue partes in one, yet might it be perceiued and sung at the first, and the
maner thereof is this. Of how manie parts the Canon is, so manie Cliefes do they set
at the beginning of the verse, stil causing that which standeth neerest vnto the musick,
serue for the leading part, the next towards the left hand, for the next following parte,
and so consequentlie to the last. But if betvveene anie tvvo Cliefes you finde rests, those
belong to that part, which the cliefe standing next vnto them on the left side signifieth.

it three minime rests. Then standeth the F fa ut cliffe on the fourth rule from below,
and because that standeth neerest to the notes, the base (which that cliffe representeth)
must begin, resting a minime rest after the plainsong, and the treble three minim restes.
And least you should misse in reckoning your pauses or rests, the note whereupon the
following part must begin, is marked with this signe?. It is true that one of those tvvo,
the signe or the rests is superfluous, but the order of setting more cliffes then one to one
verse, being but of late deuised, was not vsed when the signe was most common, but in
stead of them, ouer or vnder the song was written, in what distance the following parte
was from the leading, and most commonlie in this maner. Canon in * or * Superiore, or
inferiore. But to shun the labour of vvriting those words, the cliffes and rests haue byn
deuised, shewing the same thinge. And to the intent you may the better conceiue it,
here is another example wherin the treble beginneth, and the meane followeth within

and the replie (that is it which the principall hauing the partes changed dooth make)
are sung, changing the partes in such maner, as the highest part may be made the lowest,
and the lowest parte the highest, without anie change of motion: that is, if they
went vpward at the first, they goe also vpward when they are changed: and if they went
downeward at the first, they goe likewise downward being changed. And this is likewise
of two sortes: for if they haue the same motions being changed, they either keepe
the same names of the notes which were before, or alter them: if they keepe the same
names, the replie singeth the high part of the principall a fift lower, and the lower part
an eight higher: and if it alter the names of the notes, the higher part of the principal is
sung in the replie a tenth lower, and the lovver part an eight higher.
            The second kinde of double descant, is when the partes changed, the higher in the
lower, go by contrarie motions: that is, if they both ascende before, beeing chaunged
they descend:Rules to be obserued in compositions of the first sort of the first kinde of double descant. or if they descend before, they ascend being changed. Therefore, when
we compose in the first maner, which keepeth the same motions and the same names,
we may not put in the principall a sixt, because in the replie it will make a discord: nor
may we put the partes of the song so farre asunder, as to passe a twelfe. Nor may we euer
cause the higher part come vnder the lower, nor the lovver aboue the higher, because
both those notes which passe the tvvelfth, and also those which make the lovver
part come aboue the higher in the replie, will make discords. Wee may not also put in
the principall a Cadence, wherein the seuenth is taken, because that in the replie it will
not doe wel. We may verie well vse the Cadence wherein the second or fourth is taken,
because in the replie they will cause verie good effectes. Wee must not also put in the
principall a flat tenth, after which followeth an eight, or a tvvelfe (a flatte tenth is when
the highest note of the tenth is flat, as from D sol re, to F fa ut in alte flatte, or from Gam
ut, to B fa b mi flat) nor a flat third before an vnison, or a fift when the parts go by contrarie
motions: because if they be so put in the principall, there will follow Tritonus or
false fourth in the replie. Note also, that euerie tvvelfe in the principal, wil be in the replie
an vnison. And euery fift an eight, and al these rules must be exactlie kept in the principal,
else wil not the replie be without faults. Note also, that if you wil close with a Cadence,
you must of necessitie end either your principal or replie, in the fift or twelf, which
also happeneth in the Cadences, in what place soeuer of the song they be, and betvveene
the parts wil be heard the relation of a Tritouns or false fourth, but that will bee a small
matter, if the rest of the composition be dulie ordered, as you may perceiue in this example.

And this is called double descant in the twelfe: but if we would compose in the second
kind (that is in it,Caueats for compositions in the second sort of the first kind of double descant. which in the replie keepeth the same motions but not ye same names
which were in the principall) we must not put in anie case two cordes of one kinde togither
in the principall: as tvvo thirdes, or two sixes, and such like, although the one
be great or sharpe, and the other small or flat: nor may vve put Cadences without a discord.
The sixt likewise in this kinde may be vsed if (as I said before) you put not twoe of
them togither also if you list, the partes may one goe thorough another that is, the
lower may goe aboue the higher, and the higher vnder the lower, but with this caueat,
that when they be so mingled, you make them no further distant then a third, because
that when they remaine in their owne boundes, they may be distant a twelfth one from
another. Indeed we might goe further asunder, but though we did make them so farre
distant, yet might we not in anie case put a thirteenth, for it will bee false in the replie:
therefore it is best not to passe the twelfth, and to keepe the rules which I haue giuen, &
likewise to cause the musicke (so farre as possiblie we may) proceed by degrees, & shun
that motion of leaping (because that leaping of the fourth and the fift, may in some places
of the replie, ingender a discommoditie) which obseruations being exactlie kepte,
will cause our descant go well and formablie, in this manner.

Also these compositions might be sung of three voices if you sing a part a tenth aboue
the lowe part of the principall, and in the reply a seuenth vnder the high part. It is true
that the descant will not be so pure as it ought to be, & though it will be true from false
descant, yet will there bee vnisons & other allowances which in other musicke woulde
scarce be sufferable. But because it is somwhat hard to compose in this kind, & to haue
it come well in the replye, I will set you downe the principall rules how to do it leauing
the lesse necessarie obseruations to your own studie.Rules for singing a third part to other two in double discant. You must not then in any case put
a third or a tenth after an eighth when the parts of the song descend togither: & when
the parts ascend you must not put a sixt after a fifth, nor a tenth after a twelfth, especially
when the high part doth not proceed by degrees, which motion is a little more tollerable
then that which is made by leaping. Likewise you must not goe from an eight to a
flat tenth, except when the high part moueth by a whole note, and the lower part by a
halfe note (nor yet from a third or fifth to a flat tenth by contrary motions. Also you shal
not make the treble part go from fifth to a sharpe third the basse standing still, nor the
basse to go from a fifth to a flat third, or from a twelfth to a flat tenth the treble standing
stil, bicause the replie wil therby go against the rule. In this kind of discant euery tenth of
the principal wil be in the replie an eight, & euery third of the principal in the replie wil
be a fifteenth: but the composer must make both the principall & the replie together &
so he shal commit the fewest errors, by which means your discant wil go in this order.

a tenth, or third: Or if you make the lowe part higher by an eight, and put to a part lower
then the high part by a tenth (because it will come better) euerie one of those waies
may by themselues be sung of three voices, as you saw before in the example of the second
waie of the first kind of double descant. There be also (besides these which I haue
showen you) manie other waies of double descant, which it vvere too long and tedious
to set downe in this place, and you your selfe may hereafter by your owne studie finde
out. Therefore I will onlie let you see one waie Par arsin & thesin, and so an ende of
double descant. If therefore you make a Canon per arsin & thesin, without anie discorde
in binding maner in it, you shall haue a composition in such sort, as it may haue a
replie, wherein that which in the principall was the following part, may be the leading,
as here you see in this example.

            Thus you see that these waies of double descant carie some difficultie, and that the
hardest of them all is the Canon. But if the Canon were made in that manner vppon a
plainsong (I meane a plainesong not made of purpose for the descant, but a common
plainsong or hymne, such as heretofore haue been vsed in churches) it would be much
harder to do. But because these waies seeme rather for curiositie then for your present
instruction, I vvould counsaile you to leaue to practise them, till you be perfect in your
descant, and in those plaine waies of Canon which I haue set dovvne, which will (as it
vvere) lead you by the hand to a further knowledge: and when you can at the first sight
sing two partes in one in those kindes vppon a plainesong, then may you practise other
hard vvaies, and speciallie those per arsin & thesin, which of all other Canons carie
both most difficultie, and most maiestie: so that I thinke, that who so canne vpon anie
plainsong whatsoeuer, make such another waie as that of M. Bird, which I shevved you

before, may with great reason be termed a great maister in musicke. But whosoeuer can
sing such a one at the first sight, vpon a ground, may boldie vndertake to make any Canon
which in musicke may be made. And for your further incouragement this much
I may boldlie affirme, that whosoeuer will exercise himselfe diligentlie in that kinde,
may in short time become an excellent Musician, because that he vvho in it is perfect,
may almost at the first sight see what may be done vpon anie plainsong.
            And these few vvaies vvhich you haue alreadie seene, shall be sufficient at this time for
your perfect instruction in tvvo parts in one vpon a plainsong. For if a manne shoulde
thinke to set dovvne euerie waie, and doe nothing all his life time but dailie inuent varietie,
he should lose his labour, for anie other might come after him, and inuent as manie
others as he hath done. But if you thinke to imploy anie time in making of those, I
would counsell you diligentlie to peruse those waies which my louing Maister (neuer
without reuerence to be named of the musicians) M. Bird, and M. Alphonso in a vertuous
contention in loue betwixt themselues made vpon the plainsong of Miserere, but a
contention, as I saide, in loue: vvhich caused them striue euerie one to surmount another,
vvithout malice, enuie, or backbiting: but by great labour, studie and paines, ech
making other censure of that which they had done. Which contention of theirs (speciallie
without enuie) caused them both become excellent in that kind, and winne such a
name, and gaine such credite, as vvil neuer perish so long as Musicke indureth. Therefore,
there is no vvaie readier to cause you become perfect, then to contend with some
one or other, not in malice (for so is your contention vppon passion, not for loue of
vertue) but in loue, shevving your aduersarie your worke, and not skorning to bee corrected
of him, and to amende your fault if hee speake with reason: but of this enough.
To returne to M. Bird, and M. Alphonso, though either of them made to the number of
fortie waies, and could haue made infinite more at their pleasure, yet hath one manne,
my friend and fellow M. George Waterhouse, vpon the same plainsong of Miserere, for
varietie surpassed all who euer laboured in that kinde of studie. For hee hath alreadie
made a thousand waies (yea and though I should talke of halfe as manie more, I should
not be farrewide of the truth) euerie one different and seuerall from another. But because
I doe hope verie shortlie that the same shall bee published for the benefite of the
worlde, and his owne perpetuall glorie, I will cease to speake anie more of them, but onlie
to admonish you, that vvho so will be excellent, must both spend much time in practise,
and looke ouer the dooings of other men. And as for those who stande so much
in opinion of their owne sufficiencie, as in respect of themselues they contemn al other
men, I wil leaue them to their foolish opinions: beeing assured that euerie man but of
meane discretion, will laugh them to scorne as fooles: imagining that all the guiftes of
God should die in themselues, if they shoulde bee taken out of the vvorlde. And as for
foure partes in tvvo, sixe in three, and such like, you may hereafter make them vpon a
plainsong, when you shall haue learned to make them without it.

               I wil then take my leaue of you for this time, till my next leisure, at which time I
meane to learne of you that part of musicke which resteth. And now, because I thinke
my selfe nothing inferiour in knowledge to my brother, I meane to bring him with me
to learne that which he hath not yet heard.

                  WHat new and vnaccustomed passion, what strange
humor or mind-changing opinion tooke you this
morning (Brother Polymathes) causing you without
making me acquainted so earlie bee gone out
of your chamber? was it some fit of a feuer? or
(which I rather beleeue) was it the sight of some
of those faire faces (which you spied in your yester
nights walke) which haue banished all other
thoughts out of your minde, causing you thinke
the night long and wish the daylight that thereby
you might find some occasion of seeing your mistris?
or any thing else, I pray you hide it not from
me, for as hitherto I haue beene the secretary (as
you say) of your verie thoughts: so if you conceale
this I must thinke that either your affection towards me doth decrease, or else you begin
to suspect my secrecy.
            
            
               Pol.
               You are too gelous, for I protest I neuer hid any thing from you concerning eyther
you or my selfe, and where as you talke of passions and mind-changing humours,
those seldome trouble men of my constitution, and as for a feuer I know not what it is,
and as for loue which you would seeme to thrust vpon me, I esteeme it is a foolish passion
entering in emptie braines, and nourished with idle thoughtes, so as of all other
things I most contemne it, so do I esteeme them the greatest fooles who bee therewith
most troubled.

               Soft (brother) you go farre, the purest complexions are soonest infected, and the
best wits soonest caught in loue, and to leaue out infinite examples of others, I could set
before you those whom you esteemed cheefest in wisdome, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,
and the very dog himselfe all snared in loue, but this is out of our purpose, shew me the
occasion of this your timely departure?

               I was informed yesternight that Maister Polybius did for his recreation euerie
morning priuatelely in his owne house read a lecture of Ptolomey his great construction,
and remembring that this morning (thinking the day farther spent then in deed it was)
I hied me out thinking that if I had staied for you, I should haue come short: But to my

no smal griefe I haue learned at his house that he is gone to the vniuersity to commence
doctor in medicine.

about some businesse, or then wil be so troubled with other schollers, that we shall
hardly haue time to learne any thing of him. But in good time, I see him comming from
home with a bundle of papers in his bosome, I will salute him. Good morrow maister.

               The precepts which at that time you gaue me, were so many and diuerse that
they required long time to put them in practise, and that hath beene the cause of my so

my brother to be my schoolefellow.

               He is hartily welcome, and now wil I breake off my intended walke, and returne

               I could haue both song vpon a plainsong, and beganne to set three or foure parts,

my discant.

               First of all in the second note is taken a discord for the first part of the note, and
not in the best manner nor in binding: the like faulte is in the fifth note, and as for the
two notes before the close, the end of the first is a discord to the ground, and the beginning
of the nextlikewise a discord, but I remember when I was practising with you, you
did set me a close thus, which you did so farre

               It is the fuge of the plainsong, and the point will excuse the harshnesse, and
so likewise in the fift note, for so my maister taught me.

               You must not be so ready to condemne him for that, seeing it was the fault of the
time, not of his sufficiencie, which causeth him to sing after that manner, for I my selfe
being a childe haue heard him highly commended, who coulde vpon a plainesong sing
hard proportions, harsh allowances, and countrey daunces, and hee who could bring in
maniest of them was counted the iollyest fellowe, but I would faine see you (who haue
those Argus eies in spying faults in others) make away of your own, for perchance there
might likewise be a hole (as they saie) found in your owne cote.

for the end of your ninth note is a discord, and vpon another discord you haue begun the
tenth breaking Priscians, head to the very brain, but I know you will go about to excuse
the beginning of your tenth note in that it is in binding wise, but though it bee bound it
is in fetters of rusty yron,Binding no excuse for two discords together. not in the chaines of goulde, for no eare hearing it, but will at

               Be then attentiue, when I learned descant of my maister Bould, hee seeing me
so toward and willing to learne, euer had me in his companie, and because he continually
carried a plainsong booke in his pocket, hee caused me doe the like, and so walking in
the fieldes, he would sing the plainsong, and cause me sing the descant, and when I song
not to his contentment, he would shew me wherein I had erred, there was also another
descanter, a companion of my maisters, who neuer came in my maisters companie
(though they weare much conuersāt together) but they fel to contention, striuing who
should bring in the point soonest, and make hardest proportions, so that they thought
they had won great glorie if they had brought in a point sooner, or sung harder proportions
the one then the other: but it was a worlde to heare them wrangle, euerie one defending
his owne for the best. What? (saith the one) you keepe not time in your proportions,
you sing them false (saith the other) what proportion is this? (saith hee) Sesquipaltery
saith the other, nay (would the other say) you sing you know not what, it should

Sesqui harken after, so that if one vnacquainted with musicke had stood in a corner and
heard them, he would haue sworne they had beene out of their wittes, so earnestlie did
they wrangle for a trifle, and in truth I my selfe haue thought sometime that they would
haue gone to round buffets with the matter, for the descant bookes were made Angels,
but yet fistes were no visiters of eares, and therefore all parted friendes: but to say the
very truth, this Poliphemus had a verie good sight, (speciallie for treble descant) but very
bad vtterance, for that his voice his voice was the worst that euer I heard, and though of
others he were esteemed verie good in that kinde, yet did none thinke better of him
then hee did of himselfe, for if one had named and asked his opinion of the best composers
liuing at this time, hee woulde say in a vaine glory of his owne sufficiencie, tush,
tush (for these were his vsuall wordes) he is a proper man, but he is no descanter, hee is
no descanter there is no stuffe in him, I wil not giue two pinnes for him except he hath
descant.

               What's can a composer be without descant?
            
            
               Ma.
               No: but it should seeme by his speech yt except a name be so drownd in descant yt
he can do nothing else in musik but wrest & wring in hard points vpon a plainsong, they
would not esteeme him a descanter, but though that be the Cyclops his opinion he must

giue vs leaue to follow it if we list, for we must not thinke but hee that can formally and
artificiallie put there foure, fiue, six or more parts together, may at his ease sing one part
vpon a ground without great studie, for that singing extempore vpon a plainsong is in
deede a peece of cunning, and very necessarie to be perfectly practised of him who meaneth
to be a composer for bringing of a quick sight, yet is it a great absurditie so to seeke
for a sight, as to make it the end of our studie applying it to no other vse, for as a knife or
other instrument not being applied to the end for which it was deuised (as to cut) is vnprofitable
and of no vse, euen so is descant, which being vsed as a helpe to bring readie
sight in setting of parts is profitable, but not being applied to that ende is of it selfe like a
puffe of wind, which being past commeth not againe, which hath beene the reason that
the excellent musitions haue discontinued it, although it be vnpossible for them to compose
without it, but they rather employ their time in making of songes, which remaine
for the posterity then to sing descant which is no longer known then the singers mouth
is open expressing it, and for the most part cannot be twise repeated in one maner.

               That is true, but I pray you brother proceede with the cause of your singing of
descant in that order.

               This Polyphemus carrying such name for descant, I thought it best to imitate him,
so that euery lesson which I made was a counterfet of som of his,A course not to to be disliked if it had beene done with iudgement. for at all times and at euery
occasion I would foist in some of his points which I had so perfectly in my head as
my pater noster, and because my maister himselfe did not dislike that course I continued
still therein, but what saide I? dislike it hee did so much like it as euer where he knewe or
found any such example he would wright it out for me to imitate it.

he might haue kept them al to himselfe, for they bee all of one mould, and the

seeke to please the eare as much as shew cūning, although it be greater cunning both to
please the eare and expresse the point, then to maintaine the point alone with offence
to the eare.

in that maner, secondly the discorde taken for the last part of the fift note, and another
discord for the beginning of the next is very harsh and naught, thirdly the discord taken
for the beginning of the tenth note is naught, it and all the other notes following are
the same thing which weare in the beginning without any difference, sauing that they
are foure notes higher, lastlie your close you haue taken thrise before in the same lesson

               Phi.
               You cannot blame me for that, seeing I haue neither added to it, nor paired

in taking of descordes vsed in it as might anie waie offende, but the vnpleasantnesse of it
commeth of the vvresting in of the point, for seeking to repeat the plainsong, againe the
musicke is altered in the aire, seeming as it were another song vvhich doth disgrace it so
far as nothing more, and though a man (conceiting himselfe in his own skil, & glorying
in that he can deceiue the hearer) should at the first sight sing such a one as this is, yet another
standing by, and perchance a better musicion then he, not knowing his determination
and hearing that vnpleasantnesse of the musicke might iustly condemne it as offensiue
to the eare, then woulde the descanter alledge for his defence that it were euerie
note of the plainsong twise song ouer, and this or some such like would they thinke a sufficient
reason to moue them to admit anie harshnes, or inconuenient in musicke, what
soeuer which hath beene the cause that our musicke in times past hath neuer giuen such
contentment to the auditor as that of latter time, because the composers of that age making
no accoumpt of the ayre nor of keeping their key, followed only that vaine of wresting
in much matter in small boundes so that seeking to shewe cunning in following of
points they mist the marke, where at euerie skilful musition doth cheefely shoote, which
is to shew cunning with delightfulnesse and pleasure, you may also make a lesson of deseant

which may be song to two plainsongs, although the plainesonges doth not agree
one with another, vvhich although it seeme verie harde to them at the first, yet hauing
the rule of making it declared vnto you, it will seemes as easie in the making as to sing a
common vvay of descant, although to sing it at the first sight wil be somwhat harder because
the eie must be troubled with two plainsongs at once.

               You mistake my meaning, for both the plainesonges must not be sung at once,

               Ma.
               Hauing any two plainesongs giuen you, you must consider what corde the one
of them is to the other, so that if they be in an vnison, then may your descant be a 3. 5. 6.
8. 10. 12. or 15. to the lowest of them, but if the plainesonges bee distant by a second or
ninth, then must your descant bee a 6. or a 13. to the lowest of them, moreouer, if your
plainesongs stand still in secondes or ninthes, then of force must your descant stand still
in sixts, because there is no other shifts of concord to be had, if your plainesongs be distant
by a thirde, then may your descant be a 5. 8. 10. 12 or 15. to the lowest, and if your
plainsonges bee distant by a fourth, then may your descant bee a sixth 8. 13, or 15. to the
lowest of them, likewise if your plainesongs bee a fifth one to another, your descant may
be a 3. or 5. to the lowest of them, but if your plainesongs be in the sixth, then may your
discant be an 8: 10 15. or 17. to the lowest of them: lastly, if your plainsongs be distant a seuenth,
then may your descant be only a twelfth, also you must note that if the plainsongs
come from a fifth to a second, the lower part ascending two notes, and the higher falling
one (as you may see in the last note of the sixth bar, and first of the seuenth of the example)
then of force must your descant fall from the tenth to the sixt with the lower plainesong,
and from the sixth to the fith with the higher, and though that falling from the
sixth to the fiftth, both partes descending be not tolerable in other musicke, yet in this
we must make a vertue of necessitie, and take such allowances as the rule wil afford.

               This is well, but our comming hither at this time was not for descant, and as for
you (brother) it will bee an easie matter for you to leaue the vse of such harsh cordes in
your descant, so you wil but haue a little more care not to take that which first commeth

him descant, therefore I pray you proceede to the declaration of the rules of setting.
            
            
               Ma.
               They bee fewe and easie to them that haue descant, for the same alowances are
to be taken, and the same faults which are to be shunned in descant must bee auoided in
setting also. And because the setting of two parts is not very farre distant from singing
of descant, we will leaue to speake of it and goe to three partes, and although these precepts
of setting of three parts wil be in a maner superfluous to you, (Philomathes) because
to make two parts vpon a plainesong is more hard then to make three partes into voluntary,
yet because your brother either hath not practised that kinde of descant, or perchance
hath not beene taught how to practise it, I will set downe those rules which may
serue him both for descant and voluntary, and therefore to bee breefe peruse this Table
wherein you may see all the waies whereby concords may be set together in three parts,
and though I do in it talke of fifteenth and seuententhes, yet are these cordes seldome to
be taken in three parts except of purpose you make your song of much compas and so
you may take what distances you will, but the best maner of composing three voices or
how many soeuer is to cause the parts go close.
            
            
               
                  A Table containing the cordes which are to
bee vsed in the compositon of songes for
three voices.
                  
                     If your base bee an vnison or 8. to the tenor, then may your Alto be a 3. 5. 6. 8. 10. 12. or 15. to the base.

                     If your base bee a thirde vnder your tenor, the Altus may bee a 5. 6. 12. or 13. aboue the base.

And if your Base bee a fifth to the tenor, your Altus maie bee a 3. 8. 10. 12. or 15. to the base.

               Let this
suffice for one at
this time, and
when you come
to practise, let
the third, fift, and
sixth (sometimes
also an eight) bee
your vsuall cords
because they bee
the sweetest, and
bring most varietie,
the eight is in three parts seldome to be vsed, except in passing maner or at a close,
and because of all other closes the Cadence is the most vsuall (for without a Cadence
in some one of the parts, either with a discord or without it, it is vnpossible formallie to
close) if you carrie your Cadence in the tenor part you may close all these waies following
and manie others, and as for those waies which here you see marked with a starre
thus * they be passing closes, which we commonly cal false closes, being deuised to shun
a final end and go on with some other purpose, & these passing closes be of two kinds in
the base part, that is, either ascending or descending, if the passing close descend in the
base it commeth to the sixth, if it ascend it commeth to the tenth or third, as in some of
these examples you may see.

               If you carrie your Cadence in the base part, you may close with any of these waies following
the marke stil shewing that which it did before, & as concerning the rule which
I tould you last before of passing closes if your base be a Cadence (as your tenor was before
not going vnder the base) then will the rule bee contrarie, for whereas before your
base in your false closing did descend to a sixt, nowe must your Altus or Tenor (because
sometime the Tenor is aboue the Altus) ascend to the sixth or thirteenth and descend
to the tenth or third, as here following you may perceiue.

                     〈♫〉
                  
               
               But if your Cadence be in the Alto, then may you choose any of these waies following
for your end, the signe stil shewing the false close, which may not be vsed at a finall or full
close, and though it hat beene our vse in times past to end vpon the sixt with the base in
our songes, and speciallie in our Canons, yet is it not to bee vsed but vpon an extremitie
of Canon, but by the contraty to be shunned as much as may be, and because it is almost

euerie where out of vse, I will cease to speake any more against at this time, but turne
you to the perusing of these examples following.

               Thus much for the composition of the three parts, it followeth to shew you howe to
make foure, therefore here be two parts, make in two other middle partes to them, and
make them foure.

               Nay, seeing you haue giuen vs a table of three, I pray you giue vs one of foure also.
            
            
               Ma.
               Then (that I may discharge my selfe of giuing you any more tables) here is one
which wil serue you for the composition not only of foure parts, but of how many else it
shal please you, for when you compose more then foure parts, you do not put to anie other
part, but double some of those foure, that is, you either make two trebles or two
meanes, or two tenors, or two bases: and I haue kept in the table this order. First to set
down the cord which the treble maketh with the tenor, next how far the base may be distant
from the tenor, so that these three parts being so ordained, I set down what cordes
the Alto must be to them to make vp the harmony perfect, you must also note that somtimes
you find set down for the Alto more then one cord, in which case the cordes may
serue not only for the Alto but also for such other parts as may be added to the foure, nor
shal you find ye 
                  Alto set in an vnison or eight with any of the other parts, except in foure
places, because that when the other parts haue amongst themselues the fifth and thirde,
or their eights of necessitie such parts as shalbe added to them (let them be neuer so many)
must bee in the eight or vnion, with some of the three afore named, therefore take
it and peruse it diligentile.

composition of foure or more partes.
               
                  OF THE VNISON.
                  If the treble be an vnison with the tenor
                  and the base a third vnder the tenor
                  your Alto or meane shal be a fifth or sixth aboue the base.
               
               
                  but if the base be a fifth vnder the tenor
                  the Alto shal be a third or tenth aboue the base.
               
               
                  Likewise if the base be a sixt vnder the tenor,
                  then the Alto may be a 3 or tenth aboue the base
               
               
                  And if the base be an eight vnder the tenor,
                  the other part may bee a 3. 5. 610. or 12. aboue the base.
               
               
                  But if the base be a tenth vnder the tenor,
                  the mean shal be a fift or twelfth aboue the base.
               
               
                  
                     
But if the base be a twelfth vnder the tenor,
                  the Alto may be made a 3. or 10. aboue the base.
               
               
                  Also the base being a fifteenth vnder the tenor,
                  the other parts may be a 3. 5. 6. 10. 12. and 13. aboue the base.
               
               
                  OF THE THIRD.
                  If the treble be a third with the tenor
                  and the base a third vnder it
                  the Alto may be an vnison or 8. with the parts.
               
               
                  If the base be a sixt vnder the tenor,
                  the Altus may be a third or tenth aboue the base.
               
               
                  But if the base be an eight vnder the tenor,
                  then the Altus shall be a fift or sixt aboue the base.
               
               
                  And the base being a tenth vnder the tenor,
                  then the parts may be in the vnison or eight to the tenor or base.
               
               
                  OF THE FOVRTH.
                  When the treble shalbe a fourth to the tenor
                  and the basse a fifth vnder the tenor
                  then the meane shall be a 3, or 10, aboue the base
               
               
                  But if the base be a 12. vnder the tenor
                  the Altus shal be a 10. aboue the base
               
               
                  OF THE FIFTH.
                  But if the treble shal be a fifth aboue the tenor
                  and the base an eight vnder it
                  the Alto may be a 3 or tenth aboue the base
               
               
                  And if the base be a sixt vnder the tenor,
                  the Altus shal be an vnison or 8 with the parts
               
               
                  OF THE SIXTH.
                  If the treble be a sixt with the tenor
                  and the base a fift vnder the tenor,
                  the Altus may be an vnison or eight with the partes
               
               
                  But if the base be a third vnder the tenor,
                  the Altus shal be a fifth aboue be base.
               
               
                  Likewise if the base be a tenth vnder the tenor,
                  the meane likewise shalbe a fifth or 12. aboue the base.
               
               
                  OF THE EIGHT.
                  If the treble be an 8. with the tenor.
                  and the base a 3. vnder the tenor
                  the other parts shal be a 3. 5. 6. 10. 12. 13. aboue the base
               
               
                  So also when the base shal be a 5. vnder the tenor
                  the other parts may bee a 3. aboue the base
               
               
                  And if the base be an eight vnder the tenor
                  the other parts shall bee a 3▪ 5▪ 10. 12. aboue the base.
               
               
                  Lastly if the base be a 12. vnder the tenor
                  the parts shal make a 10. or 17. aboue the base▪
                  
               
            
            Here be also certaine examples whereby you may perceiue, your base landing in any
key, how the rest of the partes (being but foure) may stand vnto it: both going close
and in wider distances.

must note that such of them as be marked with this marke *serue for middle closes, such
as are commonlie taken at the ende of the first part of a song, the other bee finall closes
whereof such as bee suddaine closes belong properlie to light musicke, as Madrigals
Canzonets, Pauins and Galliards, wherein a semibriefe will be enough to Cadence vpon,
but if you list you may draw out your Cadence or close to what length you wil. As for the
Motets and other graue musick you must in them come with more deliberation in bindings
and long notes to the close.

                     〈♫〉
                  
circumstances) here be two parts make in two middle
partes to them and make them foure,Generall rules for setting. and of all
other cordes leaue not out the fifth, the eight and
the tenth, and looke which of those two (that is the 
                     〈♫〉
                  
eight or the tenth) commeth nexte to the treble
that set vppermost:A caueat for the sixth. How the fift and sixt may be both vsed together.
                  
                     〈♫〉
                  
but when you put in a sixt then of force must
the fift bee left out, except at a Cadence or
close where a discorde is taken thus, which
is the best manner of closing, and the onelie
waie of taking the fifth and sixth together.
            
            
               Phi.
               I thinke I vnderstand that for proofe
whereof here bee wo other parts to those
which you haue set downe.

                     〈♫〉
                  
               
            
            
               Ma.
               In deed you haue taken great
paines about them, for in the second
and thirde notes you haue taken two
eightes betwixt the tenor and base
part,Faults contron led in this lesson, which faulte is committed by
leauing out the tenth in your second
note in the tenor, for the eight you
had before betwixt the base and treble,
in your third note you haue a flat
Cadence in your counter tenor, which
is a thing against nature, for euerie
Cadence is sharpe: but some may replie
that all these three following.

                  
                     〈♫〉
                  
(the first whereof hath onelie one Cadence, in
the treble, the second hath two Cadences together,
the one in the treble, the other in the
counter, in the thirde, the meane counter and
tenor Cadence all at once) bee flat Cadences:
which thing though it might require long disputation
for solutiō of many arguments which
to diuerse purposes might be brought, yet will
I leaue to speake any more of it at this time, but
only yt they be al three passing closes, and not of
ye nature of yours, which is a kind of ful or final
close although it be cōmonlie vsed both in passing
maner in diuers places of your cōposition,
and finally at the close, but if your base ascende
halfe a note thus, 
                     〈♫〉
                   any of the other
parts making Syn copation (which
we abusiuely cal a Cadence) then of
force must your Syncopation be in that order as the first of the aforeshewed examples is,
the other two not hauing that necessitie be not in such common vse, though being aptlie
taken they might in some places bee both vsed and allowed, but of this too much,
therefore to returne to the other faultes of your lesson, in your fifth and sixth notes, your
base and counter make two eights, and the base and tenor two fifts, likewise in the ninth
note you haue in your tenor part a sharpe eight, which fault I gaue you in your descant
to bee auoided: but if you had made the tenor part an eight to the treble it had beene
farre better: Last of all your eleuenth and twelfth notes bee two fifthes in the tenor and
base.
            
            
               Pol.
               Brother me thinketh your setting is no better then my descanting.
            
            
               Phi.
               It were well if it were so good, for then could I in a moment make it better, but I
pray you (master) shew me howe these faults may bee auoided hereafter, for that I haue
obserued your rule euery where sauing in the second and twelfth notes in the tenor part.
            
            
               
                  〈♫〉
               
               Obiection.
            
            
               Ma.
               In this example you may see al
your ouersights mended.
            
            
               Pol.
               But when your base and treble
do ascend in tenths, as in the fifth and
sixth note of this example, if you must
not leaue out the fifth and the eight,
I see no other but it will fall out to bee
two eights betwixt the base and counter,
and likewise two fiftes betwixt the
base and tenor.
            
            
               
               Ma.
               Then for auoiding of that faulte, take this for a generall rule, that when the base
and treble ascend so in tenthes,Solution with rules for true ascending or descending. then must the tenor bee the eight to the treble in the second
note as for example:

                     〈♫〉
                   but by the conrrary, if the base and treble descend in the
tenthes then must the tenor bee the eight to the treble in
the first of them: example.

                     〈♫〉
                  
               
            
            
               Phi.
               These bee necessary good rules and easie to
be vnderstood,The middle parts may go one through another. but may you carrie your tenor part
higher then your counter as you haue don in your
example of tenths ascending.
            
            
               Ma.
               You may.
            
            
               Phi.
               But what needed it, seeing you might haue caused the counter sing those notes
which the tenor did, and contrary the tenor those which the counter did.
            
            
               Ma.
               No, for if I had placed the fourth note of the tenor in the counter, and the fourth
note of the counter in the tenor,For what reason one part may sing that which the other may not. then had the third and fourth notes beene two fiftes betwixt
the counter and the treble, and the fourth and fifth notes beene two eightes betweene
the tenor and treble.
            
            
               Phi.
               You say true, and I was a foole who could not conceiue the reason thereof before
you told it me, but why did you not set the fourth note of the tenor in C sol fa vt, seeing
it is a fifth and good in the eare.

                     〈♫〉
                  
               
            
            
               Ma.
               Because (although it were sufferable) it were
not good to skip vp to the fifth in that manner,Comming frō the eighth to the fifth both parts ascending naught. but if it
were taken descending, then were it very good thus.
            
            
               Phi.
               This example I like very wel for these reasons, for
(brother) if you marke the artifice of the composition
you shall see that as the treble ascendeth fiue notes, so
the tenor descendeth fiue notes likewise, the binding of
the third and fourth notes in the tenor, the base ascending
from a sixth to a fifth, causeth that sharpe fifth to
shew very wel in the eare, and it must needes bee better
then if it had beene taken ascending in the first way as I
desired to haue had it, last of all the counter in the last
foure notes dooth answere the base in fuge from the second
note to the fifth, but now I will trie to make foure
parts al of mine owne inuention.
            
            
               
               Pol.
               Take heed of breaking Priscians head, for if you do I assure you (if I perceiue it) I
will laugh as hartily at it as you did at my Sellengers
round. 
                  
                     〈♫〉
                  
               
            
            
               Phi.
               I feare you not, but maister how like
you this?
            
            
               Ma.
               Well for your first triall, but why did
you not put the sixth, seuenth and eight notes
of the tenor eight notes higher, and set them
in the counterpart, seeing they woulde haue
gone neerer to the treble then that counter
which you haue set downe.
            
            
               Phi.
               Because I should haue gone out of the
compasse of my lines.
            
            
               Ma.
               I like you well for that reason, but if
you hadde liked the other waie so well you
might haue altered your cliffes thus:

                     〈♫〉
                  
whereby you should both haue had scope enough
to bring vp your partes, and caused
them come closer together, which woulde
so much the more haue graced your example:
for the closer the partes goe the better
is the hermony, and when they stande farre
asunder the harmonie vanisheth, therefore
hereafter studie so much as you can to
make your partes goe close together,The parts must be close, so that no other may be put in betwixt them. for so
shall you both shew most art, and make your
compositions fittest for the singing of all
companies.
            
            
               Phi.
               I will, but why do you smile?

               If you haue perused his lesson sufficiently,

               I do not thinke there be a fault so sensible in it as that he may spie it.

               But either my sight is daseled or there brother I haue you by the backe, and therfore
I pray you be not offended if I serue you with the same measure you serued me.

               What is the matter?

               What corde is it to the base.

               An eight, but how then.

                  I conclude that the next is an eight likewise with the base, both descending,
and so that you haue broken Piscians head, wherefore I may Lege talionis laugh at
incongruity as well as you might at vnformality, but now I cry quittance with you.
            
            
               Phi.
               In deed I confesse you haue ouertaken me, but master, do you find no other thing
discommendable in my lesson?
            
            
               Ma.
               Yes, for you haue in the closing gone out of your key, which is one of the grosest
faults which may be committed.
            
            
               Phi.
               What do you call going out of the key?
            
            
               
               Ma.
               The leauing of that key wherein you did begin, and ending in an other.
            
            
               Phi.
               What fault is in that?
            
            
               Ma.
               A great fault,Going out of this key a great fault. for euery key hath a peculiar ayre proper vnto it selfe, so that if you
goe into another then that wherein you begun, you change the aire of the song, which
is as much as to wrest a thing out of his nature, making the asse leape vpon his maister
and the Spaniell beare the loade. The perfect knowledge of these aires (which the antiquity
termed Modi) was in such estimation amongst the learned, as therein they placed
the perfection of musicke, as you may perceiue at large in the fourth booke of Seuerinus
Boetius his musick, and Glareanus hath written a learned booke which he tooke in
hand onely for the explanation of those moodes; and though the ayre of euerie key be
different one from the other, yet some loue (by a wonder of nature) to be ioined to others
so that if you begin your song in Gamut, you may conclude it either in C fa ut or D sol re,
and from thence come againe to Gam ut: likewise if you begin your song in D sol re, you
may end in aire and come againe to D sol re, &c.
               
            
            
               Phi.
               Haue you no generall rule to be giuen for an instruction for keeping of the key?
            
            
               Ma.
               No, for it must proceede only of the iudgement of the composer, yet the church
men for keeping their keyes haue deuised certaine notes commonlie called the eight
tunes, so that according to the tune which is to be obserued, at that time if it beginne in
such a key, it may end in such and such others, as you shall immediatly know. And these
be (although not the true substance yet) some shadowe of the ancient modi whereof Botius
and Glareanus haue written so much.
            
            
               Phi.
               I pray you set downe those eight tunes, for the ancient modi, I mean by the grace
of God to study hereafter.

               This lesson is tolerable,
but yet there
bee some thinges in it
which I verie much
dislike, and first yt skipping
from the tenth,
to the eight in the last
note of the first bar,Skipping from the tenth to the eight both parts ascēding. &
first not of the second
in the counter & base
part, not being inioyned
thereunto by any
necessitie, either of
fuge or Canon, but in
plaine counterpoint
where enough of other
shift was to be had, I know you might defend your felfe with the Authorites of almost
all the composers, who at all times and almost in euerie song of their Madrigals
and Canzonets haue some such quiditie, and though it cannot bee disproued as false descant,
yet would not I vse it no more then many other thinges which are to bee found in
their works as skipping from the sixth to the eight, from the sixth to the vnison from a
tenth to an eight ascending or descending and infinite more faultes which you shal find
by excellent men cōmitted,Faults to be auoided in imitation. specially in taking of vnisons which are seldome to be vsed

so away, not standing long vpon it, where as they by the contrarie wil skip vp to it from
a sixth, third or fifth, which (as I told you before) we cal hitting an vnison or other cord
on ye face, but they before they wil break the are of their wāton amorus humor wil chose
to runne into any inconuenient in musick whatsoeuer, & yet they haue gotten the name
of musick masters though the world by their Madrigals and quicke inuentions, for you
must vnderstand that few of them compose Mottets, wheras by the contrary they make

infinit volumes of Mardigals, Canzonets, and other such ayreable musicke, yea though
he were a priest he would rather choose to excell in that wanton and pleasing musicke
then in that which properly belongeth to his profession, so much bee they by nature inclined
to loue, and therein are they to be commended for one musicion amongst them
will honor and reuerence another, whereas by the contrarie, we (if two of vs bee of one
profession) wil neuer cease to backbite one another so much as we can.
            
            
               Pol.
               You play vpon the Homonymie of the word Loue, for in that they be inclined to
lust, therein I see no reason why they should be commended, but whereas one musicion
amongst them will reuerence and loue one another, that is in deede praiseworthie,
and whereas you iustly complaine of the hate and backbiting amongst the musicions
of our countrey, that I knowe to bee most true, and speciallie in these young fellowes,
who hauing no more skill then to sing a part of a song perfectlie, and scarselie that will
take vpon them to censure excellent men, and to backbite them too, but I would not
wish to liue so long as to see a set of bookes of one of those yong yonkers compositions,
who are so ready to condemne others.
            
            
               Ma.
               I perceiue you are cholericke, but let vs returne to your brothers lesson, though
imitation be an excellent thing, yet would I wish no man so to imitate as to take whatsoeuer
his author saith, be it good or bad, and as for these scapes though in singing they be
quickly ouerpast (as being committed in Madrigals, Canzonets, and such like light musicke
and in small notes) yet they giue occasion to the ignorant of committing the same
in longer notes, as in Mottets where the fault would bee more offensiue and sooner spied.
And euen as one with a quicke hand playing vpon an instrument, shewing in voluntarie
the agilitie of his fingers, will by the hast of his conueiance cloke manie faultes,
which if they were stoode vpon would mightilie offend the eare, so those musicians because
the faultes are quickly ouerpast, as being in short notes, thinke them no faultes but
yet wee must learne to distinguish betwixt an instrument playing diuision, and a voice
expressing a dittie, & as for the going from the tenth to the eight in this place ascending,
if the base had descended to Gam ut, where it ascended to G sol re ut, then had it beene
better, but those fyrie spirits from whence you had it, would rather choose to make a
whole newe song, then to correct one which is already made, although neuer so little
alteration would haue auoided that inconuenient, else woulde they not suffer so manie
fiftes and eightes passe in their workes, yea Croce himselfe hath let fiue fiftes together
slip in one of hisTste 17. song of his second booke of Madrials of 5. voices, in the 11. & 12. semibreeues. See also the 5. 8▪ 9. & 15. of the same set. songes, and in many of them you shall finde two (which with him is
no fault as it should seeme by his vse of them) although the eastwind haue not yet blown
that custome on this side of the Alpes. But though Croce and diuerse others haue made
no scruple of taking those fiftes, yet will wee leaue to imitate him in that, nor yet will I
take vpon me to saie so much as Zarlino doth, though I thinke as much, who in the 29.
chapter of the third part of his Institutions of musick, discoursing of taking of those cords
together writeth thus. Et non si dee hauer riguardo che alcuni habbiano voluto fare il contrario,
piu presto per presuntione, che per ragione alcuna, che loro habbiano hauuto, come vedia
mo nelle loro compositioni; conciosia che non si deue imitare coloro, che fanno sfacciatamente
contra li buoni costumi, & buoni praecetti d'um' arte & di vna scienza, senza renderne ragione
aleuna: ma dobbiamo imitar quelli, che sono stati obseruatori dei buoni praecetti, & accostar si
aloro & abbracciarli come buoni maestri: lasciando sempre il tristo, & pigliando il buono: &
questo dico per che si comme il videre vnapittura, che sia dipinta convarij colori, magiormen
te dilettal'occhio, di quello che non farebbe se fusse depinta con vn solo colore: cosi l'udito
maggiormente si diletta & pigliapiacere delle consonanze & delle modulationi variate, poste
dal diligentissimo compositore nelle sue compositioni, che delli semplici & non variate:
Which is in English. Nor ought wee to haue any regard though others haue done the
contrary, rather vpon a presumption then any reason which they haue had to doe so, as

we may see in their compositions: although wee ought not to imitate them, who doe
without any shame go against the good rules and precepts of an Art and a science, with
out giuing any reason for their doings: but we ought to imitate those who haue beene
obseruers of those precepts, ioine vs to them and embrace them as good maisters, euer
leauing the bad and taking the good: and this I say because that euen as a picture painted
with diuers cullours doth more delight the eie to beholde it then if it were done but
with one cullour alone, so the eare is more delighted and taketh more pleasure of the
consonants by the diligent musicion placed in his compositions with varietie then of
the simple concords put together without any varietie at all. This much Zarlino, yet do
not I speake this, nor seeke this opinion of his, for derogation from Croce or any of those
excellent men, but wish as they take great paines to compose, so they will not thinke
much to take a little to correct, and though some of them doe boldly take those fiftes
and eightes, yet shal you hardly find either in master Alfonso (except in that place which
I cited to you before) Orlando, striggio. Clemens non papa, or any before them, nor shall
you redily find it in the workes of anie of those famous english men who haue beene nothing
inferior in art to any of the afore named, as Farefax, Tauerner, Shepherde, Mundy,
White, Persons, M. Birde, and diuers others, who neuer thought it greater sacrilidge
to spurne against the Image of a Saint then to take two perfect cordes of one kind together,
but if you chance to find any such thing in their works you may bee bold to impute
it to the ouersight of the copyers, for copies pasing from hand to hand a smal ouersight
committed by the first writer, by the second will bee made worse, which will giue occasion
to the third to alter much both in the wordes and notes, according as shall seeme
best to his owne iudgement, though (God knowes) it will be far enough from the meaning
of the author, so that errors passing from hand to hand in written copies be easilie
augmented, but for such of their workes as be in print, I dare bee bould to affirme that
in them no such thing is to be found.
            
            
               Phi.
               You haue giuen vs a good caueat how to behaue our selues in perusing the works
of other men, and likewise you haue giuen vs a good obseruation for comming into a
vnison, therefore now go forward with the rest of the faults of my lesson.
            
            
               Ma.
               The second fault which I dislike in it is in the latter end of the fift bar and beginning
of the next, where you stand in eights, for the counter is an eight to the base, and
the tenor an eight to the treble, which fault is committed by leauing out the tenth, but
if you had caused the counter rise in thirdes with the treble, it hadde beene good thus:

                     〈♫〉
                   the third fault of your lesson is in the last note of your seuenth bar,
comming from B fa b my, to F fa ut, ascending in the tenor part, of
which fault I told you enough in your descant, the like fault of vnformal
skipping is in the same notes of the same bar in the counter
part, and lastly in the same counterpart you haue left out the Cadence at the close.
            
            
               Phi.
               That vnformal fift was committed because I woulde not come from the sixth to
the fifth, ascending betweene the tenor and the treble, but if I had considered where
the note stoode, I would rather haue come from the sixth to the fifth then haue made
it as it is.
            
            
               Ma.
               That is no excuse for you, for if your partes do not come to your liking, but bee
forced to skip in that order, you may alter the other partes (as being tide to nothing) for
the altering of the leading part will much helpe the thing, so that sometime one part
may lead, and somtime another, according as the nature of the musick or of the point is,
for all points wil not be brought in alike, yet alwaies ye musick is so to be cast as the point
bee not offensiue, being compelled to run into vnisons, and therefore when the partes
haue scope enough, the musicke goeth well, but when they bee so scattered, as though
they lay a loofe, fearing to come neere one to another, thē is not the harmonie so good.
            
            
               
               Phi.
               That is verie true indeed: but is not the close of the counter a Cadence.
            
            
               Ma.
               No, for a Cadence must alwaies bee bound or then odde, driuing a small note
through a greater which the Latins (and those who haue of late daies written the art of
musicke, call Syncopation, for all binding and hanging vpon notes is called Syncopation,
as this and such like:

               Here be also other examples of Syncopation in three partes, which if you consider diligentlie
you shall finde (beside the Syncopation) a laudable and commendable manner of
causing your partes driue odde, either ascending or descending, and if you cause three
parts ascend or descend driuing, you shal not possiblie do it after any other maner then
here is set down, it is true that you may do it in longer or shorter notes at your pleasure,
but that will alter nothing of the substance of the matter. Also these driuings you shall
find in manie songes of the most approued authors, yet shall you not see them otherwise
corded, either in musicke for voices or instruments then here you may see.

done, and ioine practise with your speculation.

               I am contented, so you wil not laugh at my errors if you find any, but rather shew

               But (maister) before I begin I remember a peece of composition of foure parts of
maister Tauernor in one of his kiries, which maister Bould and all his companions did
highly comend for exceeding good, and I would gladly haue your opinion of it.
            
            
               Ma.
               Shew it me.

               Here it is.
            
            
               Ma.
               Although maister Tauerner
did it I would not imitate it.Faults in this lesson.
                  
                     〈♫〉
                  
               
            
            
               Pol.
               For what reasons?
            
            
               Ma.
               First of all the beginning is
neither pleasing nor artificial because
of that ninth taken for the last part of
the first note, and first of the nexte
which is a thing vntolerable except
there were a sixth to beare it out, for
discordes are not to bee taken except
they haue vnperfect cordes to beare
them out, likewise betwixt the treble
and counter parts another might easilie
bee placed, all the rest of the musicke
is harsh, & the close in the counter
part is both naught and stale like
vnto a garment of a strange fashion, which being new put on for a day or two will please
because of the noueltie, but being worne thread bare, wil grow in contempt, and so this
point when the lesson was made being a newe fashion was admitted for the raritie, although
the descant was naught, as being onely deuised to bee foisted in at a close amongst
many parts, for lacke of other shift, for though the song were of tenne or more
parts, yet would that point serue for one, not troubling any of the rest, but nowe a daies
it is growne in such common vse as diuers will make no scruple to vse it in fewe partes
where as it might well enough be left out, thongh it be very vsuall with our Organists.
               
            
            
               Pol.
               That is verie true, for if you wil but once walke to Paules church, you shall here it
three or foure times at the least, in one seruice if not in one verse.
            
            
               Ma.
               But if you marke the beginning of it, you shal find a fault which euen now I condemned
in your brothers lesson, for the counter is an eight to the treble, and the base an
eight to the tenor, & as the counter commeth in after the treble, so in the same maner
without varietie, the base commeth into the tenor.
            
            
               Pol.
               These bee sufficient reasons indeede, but howe might the point haue otherwise
beene brought in.
            
            
               Ma.
               Many waies, & thus for one.

                  The former lesson bettered
               
            
            
               
               Pol.
               
                  I woulde I could set down such another.
            
            
               Phi.
               Wishing will not auaile, but fabricando fabri fimus therefore neuer leaue practising
for that is in my opinion the readiest way to make such another.
            
            
               Pol.
               You say true, and therefore I will trie to bring in the same point another way.
            
            
               Phi▪
               
               I see not what you can make worth the hearing vpon that point hauing such two
going before you.

               Be not by his words terrified, but hold forward your determination, for by such
like contentions you shall profit more then you looke for.

               How like you this way?

               Very ill.
            
            
               Pol.
               I pray you
shew me particularlie
euerie
fault.faultes in this lesson.
               
            
            
               Ma.
               First of all
you begin vpon
a descorde,
secondlie the
parts be vnformall,
and lastlie
the base is
brought in out
of ye key which
faulte is committed
because
of not causing the base answere to the counter in the eight, or at least to the tenor, but
because the tenor is in the lowe key, it were too lowe to cause the base answere it in the
eight, and therefore it had beene better in this place to haue brought in the base in D sol
re, for by bringing it in C fa ut, the counter being in D la sol re, you haue changed the aire
and made it quite vnformall, for you must cause your fuge answere your leading parte
either in the fifth, in the fourth, or in the eight, & so likewise euery part to answer other,
although this rule bee not general, yet is it the best manner of maintaining pointes, for
those waies of bringing in of fuges in the third, sixth, and euery such like cordes though
they shew great sight yet are they vnpleasant and seldome vsed.
            
            
               Pol.
               So I perceaue that if I had studied of purpose to make an euill lesson I could not
haue made a worse then this, therefore once againe I will trie if I can make one which
may in some sort content you.
            
            
               Ma.
               Take heed that your last be not the worst.
            
            
               Pol.
               I would not haue it so, but tandem aliquando. how like you this?

               Ma.
               The musick is in deed true, but you haue set it in such a key as no man would haue
done, except it had beene to haue plaide it on the Organes with a quier of singing men,
for in deede such shiftes the Organistes are many times compelled to make for ease of
the singers, but some haue brought it from the Organe, and haue gone about to bring
it in common vse of singing with bad successe if they respect their credit, for take me any
of their songes, so set downe and you shall not find a musicion (how perfect soeuer hee
be) able to sol fa it right, because he shall either sing a note in such a key as it is not naturally
as la in C sol faut, sol in b fa b my, fa in alamire. or then hee shall be compelled to
sing one note in two seueral keyes in continual deduction as fa in b fa b mi, and fa in A la
mi re immediatlie one after another, which is against our very first rule of the singing our
sixe notes or tuninges, and as for them who haue not practised that kind of songes, the
verie sight of those flat cliffes (which stande at the beginning of the verse or line like a
paire of staires, with great offence to the eie, but more to the amasing of the yong singer)
make them mistearme their notes and so go out of tune, wheras by the contrary if your
song were prickt in another key any young scholler might easilie and perfectlie sing it,
and what can they possiblie do with such a number of flat b b, which I coulde not as well
bring to passe by pricking the song a note higher? lastly in the last notes of your third bar
and first of the next, and likewise in your last bar you haue committed a grosse ouersight
of leauing out the Cadence, first in your Alto, and lastly in the tenor at the very close,
and as for those notes which you haue put in the tenor part in steede of the Cadence,
though they be true vnto the partes, yet would your Cadence in this place haue beene
farre better, for that you cannot formally close without a Cadence in some one of the
parts, as for the other it is an olde stale fashion of closing commonly vsed in the fift part
to these foure (as you shall knowe more at large when I shall shewe you the practise of
fiue partes) but if you would set downe of purpose to study for the finding out of a bad
close, you could not readily light vpon a worse then this.
            
            
               Pol.
               Then I pray you correct those faults, retaining that which is sufferable.
            
            
               Ma.
               Here is your owne way altered in nothing but in the Cadences and key. But here

                     〈♫〉
                  
you must note that your song beeing gouerned with flats it is as vnformall to touch a
sharpe eight in Elami, as in this key to touch it in F fa ut, and in both places the sixth
would haue beene much better, which would haue beene an eight to the treble, besides
(which I had almost forgotten) when they make their songes with those flats, they not
onelie pester the beginning of euery verse with them but also when a note commeth in

any place where they should be vsed they will set another flat before it, so that of necessitie
it must in one of the places bee superfluous, likewise I haue seene diuers songes with
those three flats at the beginning of euerie verse, and notwithstanding not one note in
some of the places where the flat is set from the beginning of the song to the ende. But
the strangers neuer pester their verse with those flats, but if the song be naturally flat they
will set one ♭, at the beginning of the verses of euerie part, and if there happen anie extraordinarie
flat or sharpe they will set the signe before it, which may serue for the note
and no more, likewise if the song bee sharpe if there happen anie extraordinarie flat or
sharpe they will signifie it as before, the signes stil seruing but for that note before which
it standeth and for no more.
            
            
               Pol.
               This I will remember, but once againe I will see if I can with a lesson please
you any better, and for that effect I pray you giue me some point which I may maintain
            
            
               Pol.
               I will shewe you that peece of fauour if you will promise to requite me with
the like fauor.

               I wil deale more gentlie with you, for here is one which

to bee amended, but I pray you keepe silence for a little while
else shal I neuer do any good.

               Pol.
               Because you say so, I will proceed no further, and nowe let me here your opinion
of it: there after I will shew it to our master.

                  I can perceiue no grosse faults in it except that the leading
part goeth too far, before any of the rest follow, and that
you haue made the three first parts go to wide in distance.
            
            
               Pol.
               For the soone bringing in of the point, I care not, but

                     〈♫〉
                   in deede I feare my maisters reprehension, for the compas
therefore I will presentlie bee out of feare and shewe it him: I
pray you (sir) shew me the faults of this lesson,
            
            
               Ma.
               The first thing which I dislike in it is the widenesse and

                     〈♫〉
                   distāce of your parts one from another,Faults in the lesson precedent. for in your fourth bar
it were an easie matter to put in two parts betwixt your treble
and meane, and likewise two others betwixt your meane and
tenor, therefore in any case hereafter take heed of scattering
your parts in that order, for it maketh the musick seeme wild,
secondly in your fifth bar you go from the fifth to the eight in
the treble and tenor partes, but if you had set that mynime
(which standeth in b square) in D sol re causing it to come vnder
the counter part, it had beene much better and more formal. Thirdly in the seuenth
bar, your counter and tenor come into an vnison, whereas it is an easie matter to put in
three seuerall parts betweene your counter and treble. Fourthly in the eight bar your tenor
and base go into an vnison without any necessitie. Fiftlie in the tenth bar all the rest
of the partes pause while the tenor leadeth and beginneth the fuge which causeth the
musicke to seeme bare and lame, in deede if it had beene at the beginning of the second
part of a song, or after a full close the fault had beene more excusable, but as it is vsed in
this place, it disgraceth the musicke verie much. Sixthly the last note of the fifteenth bar
and first of the next are two fifths in the base and tenor parts. Lastly your close in the treble
part is so stale that it is almost worme eaten, and generally your treble part lieth so aloofe
from the rest as though it were afraide to come nigh them, which maketh all the
musicke both vnformall and vnpleasing, for the most artificial forme of composing is to
couch the parts close together, so that nothing may be either added or taken away with
out great hinderance to the other parts.
            
            
               Pol.
               My brother blamed the beginning, because the leading part went so farre before
the next: therefore I pray you let me here your opinion of that matter?
            
            
               Ma.
               In deed it is true, that the neerer the following part be vnto the leading, the better
the fuge is perceaued and the more plainelie decerned, and therefore did the musicians
striue to bring in their pointes the soonest they coulde, but the continuation of
that neerenes caused them fall into such a common manner of composing that all their
points were brought in after one sort, so that now there is almost no fuge to be found in
anie booke which hath not beene many times vsed by others, and therefore wee must
giue the fuge some more scope to come in, and by that meanes we shall shew some varietie
which cannot the other may be showne.
            
            
               Pol.
               Now (Sir) I pray you desire my brother Philomathes to maintaine the same point,
that I may censure him with the same liberty wherewith hee censured me, for hee hath
heard nothing of al which you haue saide of my lesson.
            
            
               Ma.
               I wil. Philomathes: let me here how you can handle this same point.

adoe: here it is, shew me the faults.

               Wee will first here what your: brother saieth to it,
and then will I declare mine opinion.
            
            
               Phi.
               If he be the examiner, I am not afraide of condemnation.
            
            
               Pol.
               What? do you thinke I will spare you?
            
            
               Phi.
               Not so: but I doubt of your sufficiencie to spie and
examine the faultes, for they will be very grosse if you find
them.
            
            
               Pol.
               It may be that before I haue don you wil thinke them
grosse enough.
            
            
               Ma.
               Go then roundly to worke, and shew vs what you
mislike in the lesson.
            
            
               Pol.
               Then:Faults in the lesson Precedent. 
                  Inprimis, I mislike the beginning vpon an vnison, Item I mislike two discordes
(that is a second and a fourth) taken both together after the vnison in the second
bar betwixt the tenor and counter: Item, Tertio I condemne as naught, the standing in
the sixt a whole briefe together in the third bar in the counter & tenor parts, for though
it be true and withal other shift enough to be had, yet be those vnperfect cords, seldome
vsed of the skilfull, except when some perfect commeth immediatlie after them, and
there for being taken but to sweeten the musicke, though they make great varietie they
must not be holden but in length, and stood vpon so long as others, but lightlie touched
and so away. Besides, in manie parts if the sixth be so stood vpon it will be the harder to
make good parts to them. Item, Quarto I condemne the standing in the vnison a whole
semibriefe in the last note of the seuenth bar in the treble and counter parts, where you
must note that the fault is in the treble and not in the counter. Lastlie, I condemne two
fiftes in the penulte and last notes of the tenth bar in the treble and tenor parts: likewise,
that close of the tenor is of the ancient blocke, which is now growne out of fashion, because
it is thought better & more cōmendable to come to a close deliberately with drawing
and binding descant, then so suddenly to close, except you had an aeuoue or Amen to
sing after it. How saie you (M.) haue I not said prettely wel to my young maisters lesson.
            
            
               Ma.
               In deede you haue spied well, but yet there bee two thinges which haue escaped
your fight.
            
            
               
               Pol.
               It may be it past my skil to perceiue them, but I pray you which be those two?
            
            
               Ma.
               The taking of a Cadence in the end of the fifth barre,More faults in the lesson procedent. and beginning of the next,
which might either haue beene below in the tenor or aboue in the treble, and is such a
thing in all musicke, as of all other things must not bee left out, especiallie in closing eyther
passing in the middest of a song or ending: for though it were but in two partes yet
would it grace the musicke, & the 
                     〈◊〉
                   i
                     •
                   were vsed, the better the song or lesson would
be: much more in many parts: and in this place it had beene far better to haue left out any
cords whatsoeuer then the Cadence: and though you would keepe all the foure parts
as they be, yet if you sing it in G sol re ut, either in the treble or tenor, it wold make a true
fifth part to them. The Cadence likewise is left out where it might haue beene taken in
the ninth bar and counter part, which if it had beene taken would haue caused the Tenor
to come vp neerer to the counter, and the counter to the treble, and therby so much
the more haue graced the musicke.
            
            
               Phi.
               It greeues me that he should haue found so many holes in my cote, but it may be
that he hath bin taken with some of those faultes himselfe in his last lesson, and so might
the more easely find them in mine.
            
            
               Ma,
               You may peruse his lesson and see that.
            
            
               Pol.
               But (sir) seeing both wee haue tried our skill vpon one point, I pray you take the
same point and make something of it which we may imitate, for I am sure my brother
wil be as willing to see it as I.
            
            
               Phi.
               And more willing (if more may be) therefore let vs intreat you to do it.

               Little intreatie will serue for such a matter, and therefore here it is.

               In mine opinion hee who can bnt rightly imitate this one lesson may be counted a
good musicion.
            
            
               Phi.
               Why so?
            
            
               
               Pol.
               Because there be so many and diuers waies of bringing in the fuge shewed in it
as would cause any of my humor bee in loue with it, for the point is brought in in the
true ayre the parts going so close and formally that nothing more artificiall can bee wished:
likewise marke in what maner any part beginneth and you shal see some other reply
vpon it in the same point, either in shorter or longer notes also in the 22. barre when
the Tenor expresseth the point, the base reuerteth it, and at a worde I can compare it to
nothing but to a wel garnished garden of most sweete flowers, which the more it is searched
the more variety it yeldeth.
            
            
               Ma.
               You are too hyperbolicall in your phrases, speaking not according to skil, but affection,
but in truth it is a most common point, and no more then commonly handled,
but if a man would study, he might vpon it find varietie enough to fil vp many sheets of
paper: yea, though it were giuen to all the musicions of the world they might compose
vpon it, and not one of their compositions be like vnto that of another. And you shall
find no point so wel handled by any man, either Composer or Organist, but with studie
either he himselfe or some other might make it much better. But of this matter enough,
and I thinke by the lessons and precepts which you haue already had, you may
well enough vnderstand the most vsual allowances and disallowances in the composition
of foure parts. It followeth now to shew you the practise of fiue, therefore (Philomathes)
let me see what you can doe at fiue, seeing your Brother hath gone before you in
foure.
            
            
               Phi.
               I wil: but I pray you what generall rules and obseruations are to bee kept in fiue
partes?
            
            
               Ma.
               I can giue you no generall rule, but that you must haue a care to cause your parts
giue place one to another, and aboue all thinges auoide standing in vnisons, for seeing
they can hardly bee altogether auoided the more care is to bee taken in the good vse of
them, which is best shown in passing notes, and in the last part of a note. The other rules
for casting of the partes and taking of allowances be the same which were in foure parts.
            
            
               Phi.
               Giue me leaue then to pause a little, and I wil trie my skill:
            
            
               Ma.
               Pause much, and you shal do better.
            
            
               Pol.
               What? wil much studie helpe?
            
            
               Ma.
               Too much study dulleth the vnderstanding, but when I bid him pause much, I
wil him to correct often before he leaue.
            
            
               Pol.
               But when he hath once set downe a thing right, what neede him study any more
at that time?
            
            
               Ma.
               When he hath once set downe a point, though it be right, yet ought hee not to
rest there, but should rather looke more earnestly howe hee may bring it more artificiallie
about.
            
            
               Pol.
               By that meanes hee may scrape out that which is good, and bring in that which
wilbe worse.
            
            
               Ma.
               It may be that he wil do so at the first, but afterwards when he hath discretion to
decerne the goodnesse of one point aboue another, hee will take the best and leaue the
worst. And in that kind, the Italians and other strangers are greatlie to be commended,
who taking any point in hand, wil not stand long vpon it, but wil take the best of it and so
away to another, whereas by the contrarie, we are so tedious that of one point wee will
make as much as may serue for a whole song, which though it shew great art in variery,
yet is it more then needeth, except one would take vpon them to make a whole fancy of
one point. And in that also you shall find excellent fantasies both of maister Alfonso, Horatio
Vecci, and others. But such they seldome compose, exceptit either bee to shewe
their varietie at some odde time to see what may be done vpon a point without a dittie,
or at the request of some friend, to shew the diuersitie of sundrie mens vaines vpon one
subiect. And though the Lawyers say that it were better to suffer a hundred guilty persons

escape them to punish one guitles, yet ought a musicion rather blotte out twentie
good points then to suffer one point passe in his compositions vnartificially brought in.

               Phi.
               I pray you
what is the fault.
            
            
               Ma.
               The compasse, for as it standeth you shall hardly finde fiue ordinarie voices to
sing it, and is it not a shame for you being tould of that fault so many times before, to fall
into it now againe? for if you marke your fift bar, you may easely put three parts betwixt
your meane and tenor, and in the eight bar you may put likewise three parts betweene
your treble and meane, grosse faults and only committed by negligence, your last notes

of the ninth bar and first of the next are two fifts in the treble, and meane parts, and your
two last barres you haue robde out of the capca
                     •
                  e of some olde Organist, but that close
though it fit the singer as that the deformitie whereof may be hidden by flurish, yet is it
not sufferable in compositions for voices, seeing there be such harsh discordes taken as
are flat against the rules of musicke.
            
            
               Phi.
               As how?
            
            
               Ma.
               Discorde against discorde, that is, the treble and tenor are a discorde, and the
base and tenor likewise a discord in the latter part of the first semibriefe of the last barre,
and this fault is committed by breaking the notes in diuision, but that and many other
such closings haue beene in too much estimation heretofore amongst the verie chiefest
of our musicians, whereof amongst many euill this is one of the worst.

               Wherein do ye condemne this close, seeing it is both in long notes and likewise
a Cadence.
            
            
               Ma.
               No man can condemne it in the treble counter or base partes, but the Tenor is
a blemish to the other, and such a blemish as if you will study of purpose to make a bad
part to any others you coulde not possible make a worse, therefore in any case abstaine
from it and such like.
            
            
               Phi.
               Seeing the other parts be good how might the tenor be alterid and made better.

selfe will not denie but that you find much better ayre and more fulnes
then was before, you may replie and say the other was fuller because
it did more offende the eare, but by that reason you might likewise
argue that a song full of false descant is fuller then that which is made of true cords. But
(as I tolde you before) the best comming to a close is in binding wise in long drawing
notes (as you see in the first of these examples following) and most chiefely when a fuge
which hath beene in the same song handled is drawne out to make the close in binding
wise, as imagine that this point hath in your song beene maintained 
                     〈♫〉
                  
you may drawe it out to make the close as you see in the last of these

               You haue

keye.
            
            
               Ma.
               That is
no fault, for you
may make your
song ether of two
Trebles, or two
Meanes in ye high
key or low key, as
you list.
            
            
               Phi.
               What do
you meane by the
high key?
            
            
               Ma.
               All songs
made by the Musicians,
who make
songs by discretion, are either in the high key or in the lowe key. For if you make your
song in the high key, here is the compasse of your musicke, with the forme of setting
the cliffes for euery part.
               
                  
                  
                     〈♫〉
                  
Canto. Alto. Tenor & Quinto. Basso.
               But if you would make your song of two trebles you may make the two highest parts
both with one cliffe, in which case one of them is called Quinto. If the song bee not of
two trebles, then is the Quinto alwaies of the same pitch with the tenor, your Alto or
meane you may make high or lowe as you list, setting the cliffe on the lowest or second
rule. If you make your song in the low key, or for meanes then must you keepe the compasse
and set your cliffe as you see here.

                     〈♫〉
                  
The high Meane. The low Meane. Alto. Tenor. Basso.
               The musicians also vse to make some compositions for men onely to sing, in which
case they neuer passe this compasse.

                     〈♫〉
                  
Alto. Tenor primus. Tenor secundus. Bassus.
               Now must you diligentlie marke that in which of all these compasses you make your
musicke, you must not suffer any part to goe without the compasse of his rules, except
one note at the most aboue or below, without it be vpon an extremity for the ditties sake
or in notes taken for Diapasons in the base. It is true that the high and lowe keyes come
both to one pitch, or rather compasse, but you must vnderstand that those songs which
are made for the high key be made for more life, the other in the low key with more grauetie
and staidnesse, so that if you sing them in contrarie keyes, they wil loose their grace
and wil be wrested as it were out of their nature: for take an instrument, as a Lute Orphadrion,
Pandorae▪
                   or such like, being in the naturall pitch, and set it a note or two lower it
wil go much heauier and duller, and far from that spirit which it had before, much more
being foure notes lower then the naturall pitch.
               Likewise take a voice being neuer so good, and cause it sing aboue the naturall reach
it will make an vnpleasing and sweete noise, displeasing both the singer because of the
straining, and the hearer because of the wildenes of the sound: euen so, if songes of the
high key be sung in the low pitch, & they of the low key sung in the high pitch, though
it will not be so offensiue as the other, yet will it not breed so much contentment in the
hearer as otherwise it would do. Likewise, in what key soeuer you compose let not your
parts be so far asunder as that you may put in any other betwixt them, (as you haue don
in your last lesson) but keepe them close together, and if it happen that the point cause
them go an eight one from the other (as in the beginning of my example you may see)
yet let them come close together againe, and aboue all thinges keepe the ayre of your
key (be it in the first tune, second tune, or other) except you bee by the wordes forced to
beare it, for the Dittie (as you shall know hereafter) will compell the author many times
to admit great absurdities in his musicke, altering both time, tune, cullour ayre and what
soeuer else, which is commendable so hee can cunninglie come into his former ayre
againe.
            
            
               
               Phi.
               I wil by the grace of God diligentlie obserue these rules, therefore I pray you giue vs
some more examples which we may imitate, for how can a workeman worke, who hath had
no patterne to instruct him.
            
            
               Ma.
               If you would compose well the best patternes for that effect or the workes of excellent
men, wherin you may perceiue how points are brought in, the best way of which is when
either the song beginneth two seuerall points in two seuerall parts at once, or one point foreright
and reuerted. And though your foreright fuges be verie good, yet are they such as any
man of skil may in a manner at the first sight bring in, if hee doe but heare the leading part
sung: but this way of two or three seueral points going together is the most artificiall kinde of
composing which hetherto hath beene inuented, either for Motets or Madrigals, speciallie
when it is mingled with reuertes, because so it maketh the musick seeme more strange, wherof
let this be an example.

               And must euerie part maintaine that point wherewith it did begin, not touching that
of other parts?
            
            
               Ma.
               No, but euerie part may replie vpon the point of another, which causeth verie good
varietie in the harmonie, for you see in the example that euerie part catcheth the point from
another, so that it which euen now was in the high part, will bee straight waie in a lowe part
and contrarilie.

               Now shew vs an example of a point reuerted.

               You must not thinke but that our master hath some one secret in composition which
is not common to euery scholler, and though this seeme absurd in our dul and weake iudgement,
yet out of doubt our master hath not set it downe to vs without iudgement.

               It is not onely tollerable but commendable, and so much the more commendable as
it is far from the common and vulgar vaine of closing, but if you come to peruse the works of
excellent musicians you shall finde many such bindings, the strangenesse of the inuention of
which, chiefelie caused them to be had in estimation amongst the skilful.

               The time is almost spent: therefore that you may perceiue the maner of composition
in sixe partes, and the nature of a Madrigale both at once. Here is an example of that kind

vpon, but once or twice driuen through all the partes, and sometimes reuerted, and so to the
close then taking another and that kind of handling points is most esteemed in Madrigals either
of fiue or sixe parts, specially when two parts go one way, and two another way, and most
commonly in tenthes or thirdes, as you may see in my former example of fiue parts, of maintaining
two points or more at once. Likewise the more varietie of points bee shewed in one
song, the more is the Madrigal esteemed, and withall you must bring in fine bindinges and
strange closes according as the words of your Dittie shal moue you, also in these compositions
of sixe parts, you must haue an especiall care of causing your parts giue place one to another,
which you cannot do without restings, nor can you (as you shall knowe more at large
anon) cause them rest till they haue expressed that part of the dittying which they haue begun,
and this is the cause that the parts of a Madrigal either of fiue or sixe parts go somtimes
full, sometimes very single, sometimes iumping together, and somtime quite contrarie waies,
like vnto the passion which they expresse, for as you schollers say that loue is ful of hopes and
feares, so is the Madrigall or louers musicke full of diuersitie of passions and ayres.

               Now sir because the day is far spent, and I feare that you shall not haue time enough to

               To satisfie your request in some respect, I will shewe you a fewe whereby of your selfe
you may learne to find out more. A Canon then (as I told you before scholler Philomathes)
may be made in any distance comprehended within the reach of ye voice, as the 3. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9
10. 11. 12. or other. but for the composition of Canons no generall rule can be giuen as that
which is performed by plaine sight, wherfore I wil refer it to your own studie to find out such
points as you shall thinke meetest to bee followed, and to frame and make them fit for your
Canon, the Authors vse the Canons in such diuersitie that it were folly to thinke to set down
al the formes of them, because they be infinet, and also dailie more and more augmented by diuers,
but most commonly they set some darke words by them, signifiyng obscurely how they
are to be found out, and sung as by this of Iusquin you may see.

               For he setting downe a song of foure parts, hauing prickt all the other partes at length, setteth
this for the base, and by the word Antipodes you must vnderstand perarsin & the sin thogh
the word multiplicantes bee to obscure a direction to signifie that euerie note must bee foure
times the value of it selfe, as you may perceiue by this

parts in one, yet be these words a Canon: if you desire to see the rest of the parts at length you
may finde them in the third booke of Glareanus his dodecachordon. But to come to those Canons
which in one part haue some others concluded, here is one without any Canon in words,
composed by an olde author Petrus Platensis, wherein the beginning of euerie part is signified
with a letter S. signifying the highest or Saprema vox, C. the Counter, T. Tenor, and B.
the base, but the ende of euerie part hee signified by the same letters inclosed in a semicircle,
thus:

               Of this kinde and such like, you shall find many both of 2, 3, 4, 5. and sixe parts, euery where
in the works of Iusquin, Petrus Patensis, Brumel, & in our time, in the Introductions of Baselius
& Caluisius with their resolutions and rules how to make them, therfore I wil cease to speake
any more of them, but many other Canons there bee with oenigmaticall wordes set by them,

                     Foure parts in two be sure of this:
                     But first seeke out to know my mind,
                     Or els this Cannon you may misse.
                  
               
               Which is indeed so obscure that no man without the Resolution wil find out how it may be

               Likewise you may make eight partes in foure (or fewer or more as you list) which may bee

at the ending, and so sing it quight through, and the rules to make it be these, make how many
parts you list, making two of a kind (as two trebles, two tenors, two counters, and two bases)
but this caueat you must haue, that at the beginning of the song al the parts must begin together
full, and that you must not set any pricke in all the song (for though in singing the part
forward it wil go wel, yet when the other commeth backward it wil make a disturbance in the
musicke because the singer wil be in a doubt to which note the pricke belongeth. For if hee
should hould it out with the note which it followeth it would make an odde number, or then
he must hold it in that tune wherin the following note is, making it of that time as if it followed
that note, which would be a great absurdtirie to set a prieke before the note, of which it taketh
the time: hauing so made your song, you must set one part at the end of the other of the
same kind (as treble after treble, base after base, &c.) so that the end of the one be ioined to the
end of the other, so shall your musicke go right forward and backward, as thus for example.

Foure parts in one in the vnison.
               Nowe hauing discoursed vnto you the composition of three,Rules to be obserued in dittying. foure, fiue and sixe
partes with these fewe waies of Canons and catches:
               It followeth to shew you how to dispose your musicke according to the nature of the words
which you are therein to expresse, as whatsoeuer matter it be which you haue in hand, such a
kind of musicke must you frame to it. You must therefore if you haue a graue matter, applie a
graue kinde of musicke to it▪ if a merrie subiect you must make your musicke also merrie. For
it will be a great absurditie to vse a sad harmonie to a merrie matter, or a merrie harmonie to
a sad lamentable or tragicall dittie. You must then when you would expresse any word signifying
hardnesse, crueltie, bitternesse, and other such like, make the harmonie like vnto it, that is,
somwhat harsh and hard but yet so yt it offend not. Likewise, when any of your words shal expresse
complaint, dolor, repentance, sighs, teares, and such like, let your harmonie be sad and
doleful, so that if you would haue your musicke signifie hardnes, cruelty or other such affects,
you must cause the partes proceede in their motions without the halfe note, that is, you must
cause them proceed by whole notes, sharpe thirdes, sharpe sixes and such like (when I speake
of sharpe or flat thirdes, and sixes, you must vnderstand that they ought to bee so to the base)
you may also vse Cadences bound with the fourth or seuenth, which being in long notes will
exasperat the harmonie: but when you woulde exprrsse a lamentable passion, then must you
vse motions proceeding by halfe notes. Flat thirdes and flat sixes, which of their nature are
sweet, speciallie being taken in the true tune and naturall aire with discretion and iudgement.
but those cordes so taken as I haue saide before are not the sole and onely cause of expressing
those passions, but also the motions which the parts make in singinng do greatly helpe, which
motions are either naturall or accidental. The naturall motions are those which are naturallie
made betwixt the keyes without the mixture of any accidentall signe or corde, be it either flat
or sharpe, and these motions be more masculine causing in the song more virilitie then those
accidentall cordes which are marked with these signes. ♯. ♭. which be in deede accidentall,
and make the song as it were more effeminate & languishing then the other motions which
make the song rude and sounding: so that those naturall motions may serue to expresse those
effectes of crueltie, tyrannie, bitternesse and such others, and those accidentall motions
may fitlie expresse the passions of griefe, weeping, sighes, sorrowes, sobbes, and such
like.
               
                  
Also, if the subiect be light, you must cause your musicke go in motions, which carrie with
them a celeritie or quicknesse of time, as minimes, crotchets and quauers: if it be lamentable,
the note must goe in slow and heauie motions, as semibreues, breues and such like, and of all
this you shall finde examples euerie where in the workes of the good musicians. Moreouer,
you must haue a care that when your matter signifieth ascending, high heauen, and such like,
you make your musicke ascend: and by the contrarie where your dittie speaketh of descending
lowenes, depth, hell, and others such, you must make your musicke descend, for as it will be
thought a great absurditie to talke of heauen and point downwarde to the earth: so will it be
counted great incongruitie if a musician vpon the wordes hee ascended into heauen shoulde
cause his musicke descend, or by the contrarie vpon the descension should cause his musicke
to ascend. We must also haue a care so to applie the notes to the wordes, as in singing there
be no barbarisme committed: that is, that we cause no sillable which is by nature short be expressed
by manie notes or one long note, nor no long sillable bee expressed with a shorte
note, but in this fault do the practitioners erre more grosselie, then in any other, for you shall
find few songes wherein the penult sillables of these words, Dominus, Angelus, filius, miraculum,
gloria, and such like are not expressed with a long note, yea many times with a whole
dossen of notes, and though one should speak of fortie he should not say much amisse, which
is a grosse barbarisme, & yet might be easelie amended. We must also take heed of seperating
any part of a word from another by a rest, as som dunces haue not slackt to do, yea one whose
name is Iohannes Dunstaple (an ancient English author) hath not onlie deuided the sentence,
but in the verie middle of a word hath made two long rests thus, in a song of foure parts vpon
these words, Nesciens virgo mater virum.

Ipsum regem angelo rum so la vir go lacta bat.
               For these be his owne notes and wordes, which is one of the greatest absurdities which I
haue seene committed in the dittying of musicke, but to shewe you in a worde the vse of the
rests in the dittie, you may set a crotchet or minime rest aboue a coma or colon, but a longer
rest then that of a minime you may not make till the sentence bee perfect, and then at a full
point you may set what number of rests you will. Also when you would expresse sighes, you
may vse the crotchet or minime rest at the most, but a longer then a minime rest you may not
vse, because it will rather seeme a breth taking then a sigh, an example whereof you may see
in a very good song of Stephano venturi to fiue voices vpon this dittie quell'aura che spirando
a Paura mia? for comming to the worde sospiri (that is sighes) he giueth it such a natural grace
by breaking a minime into a crotchet rest and a crotchet, that the excellency of his iudgment
in expressing and gracing his dittie doth therein manifestlie appeare. Lastlie, you must not
make a close (especiallie a full close) till the full sence of the words be perfect: so that keeping
these rules you shall haue a perfect agreement, and as it were a harmonicall concent betwixt
the matter and the musicke, and likewise you shall bee perfectly vnderstoode of the auditor
what you sing, which is one of the highest degrees of praise which a musicion in dittying can
attaine vnto or wish for. Many other pettie obseruations there be which of force must be left
out in this place, and remitted to the discretion and good iudgement of the skilful composer.
               
                  Pol.
                  Now (sir) seeing you haue so largely discoursed of framing a fit musicke to the nature
of a dittie, we must earnestly intreat you, (if it be not a thing too troblesome) to discourse vnto
vs at large all the kinds of musicke, with the obseruations which are to be kept in composing
of euerie one of them.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Although by that which I haue alreadie shewed you, you might with studie collect
the nature of all kindes of musicke, yet to ease you of that paine, I will satisfie your request

though not at full, yet with so many kinds as I can call to memorie: for it wil be a hard matter
vpon the suddaine to remember them al, and therfore (to go to the matter roundly, and without
circumstances) I say that all musicke for voices (for onlie of that kinde haue we hetherto
spoken) is made either for a dittie or without a dittie, if it bee with a dittie, it is either graue or
light, the graue ditties they haue stil kept in one kind, so that whatsoeuer musicke bee made
vpon it, is comprehended vnder the name of a Motet: a Motet is properlie a song made for
the church, either vpon some hymne or Antheme, or such like, and that name I take to haue
beene giuen to that kinde of musicke in opposition to the other which they called Canto fermo,
and we do commonlie call plainsong, for as nothing is more opposit to standing and firmnes
then motion, so did they giue the Motet that name of mouing, because it is in a manner
quight contrarie to the other, which after some sort, and in respect of the other standeth still.
This kind of al others which are made on a ditty, requireth most art, and moueth and causeth
most strange effects in the hearer, being aptlie framed for the dittie and well expressed by the
singer, for it will draw the auditor (and speciallie the skilfull auditor) into a deuout and reuerent
kind of consideration of him for whose praise it was made. But I see not what passions or
motions it can stirre vp, being sung as most men doe commonlie sing it: that is, leauing out
the dittie and singing onely the bare note, as it were a musicke made onelie for instruments,
which will in deed shew the nature of the musicke, but neuer carrie the spirit and (as it were)
that liuelie soule which the dittie giueth, but of this enough. And to returne to the expressing
of the ditty, the matter is now come to that state that though a song be neuer so wel made &
neuer so aptlie applied to the words, yet shal you hardlie find singers to expresse it as it ought
to be, for most of our church men, (so they can crie louder in ye quier then their fellowes) care
for no more, whereas by the contrarie, they ought to studie howe to vowell and sing cleane,
expressing their wordes with deuotion and passion, whereby to draw the hearer as it were in
chaines of gold by the eares to the consideration of holie things. But this for the most part,
you shall find amongst them, that let them continue neuer so long in the church, yea though
it were twentie yeares, they will neuer studie to sing better then they did the first day of their
preferment to that place, so that it should seeme that hauing obtained the liuing which they
sought for, they haue little or no care at all either of their owne credit, or well discharging of
that dutie whereby they haue their maintenance. But to returne to our Motets, if you compose
in this kind, you must cause your harmonie to carrie a maiestie taking discordes and bindings
so often as you canne, but let it be in long notes, for the nature of it will not beare short
notes and quicke motions, which denotate a kind of wantonnes.
                  This musicke (a lamentable case) being the chiefest both for art and vtilitie, is notwithstanding
little esteemed, and in small request with the greatest number of those who most highly
seeme to fauor art, which is the cause that the composers of musick who otherwise would follow
the depth of their skill, in this kinde are compelled for lacke of moecenates to put on another
humor, and follow that kind wherunto they haue neither beene brought vp, nor yet (except
so much as they can learne by seeing other mens works in an vnknown tounge) doe perfectlie
vnderstand ye nature of it, such be the newfangled opinions of our countrey men, who
will highlie esteeme whatsoeuer commeth from beyond the seas, and speciallie from Italie,
be it neuer so simple, contemning that which is done at home though it be neuer so excellent.
Nor yet is that fault of esteeming so highlie the light musicke particular to vs in England, but
generall through the world, which is the cause that the musitions in all countries and chiefely
in Italy, haue imploied most of their studies in it: whereupon a learned man of our time writing
vpon Cicero his dreame of Scipio saith, that the musicians of this age, in steed of drawing
the minds of men to the consideration of heauen and heauenlie thinges, doe by the contrarie
set wide open the gates of hell, causing such as delight in the excercise of their art tumble
headlong into perdition.
                  This much for Motets, vnder which I comprehend all graue and sober musicke, the light

musicke hath beene of late more deepely diued into,Light musicke. so that there is no vanitie which in it
hath not beene followed to the full,A Madrigal but the best kind of it is termed Madrigal, a word for the
etymologie of which I can giue no reason, yet vse sheweth that it is a kinde of musicke made
vpon songs and sonnets, such as Petrarcha and many Poets of our time haue excelled in This
kind of musicke weare not so much disalowable if the Poets who compose the ditties would
abstaine from some obscenities, which all honest eares abhor, and sometime from blasphemies
to such as this, ch'altro di te iddio non voglio which no man (at least who hath any hope
of saluation) can sing without trembling. As for the musick it is next vnto the Motet, the most
artificiall and to men of vnderstanding most delightfull. If therefore you will compose in this
kind you must possesse your selfe with an amorus humor (for in no cōposition shal you proue
admirable except you put on, and possesse your selfe wholy with that vaine wherein you compose)
so that you must in your mnsicke be wauering like the wind, sometime wanton, somtime
drooping, sometime graue and staide, otherwhile effeminat, you may maintaine points and
reuert them, vse triplaes and shew the verie vttermost or your varietie, and the more varietie
you shew the better shal you please. In this kind our age excelleth, so that if you would imitate
any, I would appoint you these for guides: Alfonso ferrabosco for deepe skill, Luca Marenzo
for good ayre and fine inuention, Horatto Vecchi, Stephano Venturi, Ruggiero Giouanelli, and
Iohn Croce, with diuers others who are verie good, but not so generallie good as these. The
seconde degree of grauetie in this light musicke is giuen to Canzonets that is little shorte
songs (wherin little arte can be shewed being made in straines,Canzonets the beginnng of which is some
point lightlie touched, and euerie straine repeated except the middle) which is in composition
of the musick a counterfet of the Madrigal. Of the nature of these are the Neapolitans or
Canzone a la Napolitana,
                     Neapolitās different from them in nothing sauing in name, so that whosoeuer
knoweth the nature of the one must needs kuow the other also, and if you thinke them worthie
of your paines to compose them, you haue a patterne of them in Luco Marenzo and Iohn
Feretti, who as it should seeme hath imploied most of all his study that way. The last degree
of grauetie (if they haue any at all is giuen to the villanelle or countrie songs which are made
only for the ditties sake,Villenelle. for so they be aptly set to expresse the nature of the ditty, the composer
(though he were neuer so excellent) will not sticke to take many perfect cordes of one kind
together, for in this kind they thinke it no fault (as being a kind of keeping decorum) to make
a clownish musicke to a clownish matter, & though many times the dittie be fine enough yet
because it carrieth that name villanella they take those disallowances as being good enough
for plow and cart There is also another kind more light then this,Ballette. which they tearme Ballete
or daunces, and are songs, which being song to a dittie may likewise be daunced: these and all
other kinds of light musicke sauing the Madrigal are by a generall name called ayres. There
be also an other kind of Ballets, commonlie called falas, the first set of that kind which I haue
seene was made by Gastaldi, if others haue laboured in the same field, I know not but a slight
kind of musick it is, & as I take it deuised to be daunced to voices. The slightest kind of musick
(if they deserue the name of musicke) are the vinate or drincking songes,Vinate for as I said before,
there is no kinde of vanitie whereunto they haue not applied some musicke or other, as they
haue framde this to be sung in their drinking, but that vice being so rare among the Italians,
& Spaniards: I rather thinke that musicke to haue bin deuised by or for the Germains (who in
swarmes do flocke to the Vniuersitie of Italie) rather then for the Italians themselues.Iustinianes. There is
likewise a kind of songs) which I had almost forgotten) called Iustinianas, and are al written in
the Bergamasca language a wanton and rude kinde of musicke it is, and like enough to carrie
the name of some notable Curtisan of the Citie of Bergama, for no man will denie that Iustiniana
is the name of a woman. There be also many other kindes of songes which the Italians
make as Pasterellas and Passamesos with a dittie and such like,
                        Pastorelle passamezos with ditties Fantasies. which it would be both tedious
and superfluons to delate vnto you in words, therfore I will leaue to speake any more of them,
and begin to declare vnto you those kinds which they make without ditties. The most principall

and chiefest kind of musicke which is made without a dittie is the fantasie, that is, when
a musician taketh a point at his pleasure, and wresteth and turneth it as he list, making either
much or little of it according as shall seeme best in his own conceit. In this may more art be
showne then in any other musicke, because the composer is tide to nothing but that he may
adde, deminish, and alter at his pleasure. And this kind will beare any allowances whatsoeuer
tolerable in other musick, except changing the ayre & leauing the key, which in fantasie may
neuer bee suffered. Other thinges you may vse at your pleasure, as bindings with discordes,
quicke motions, slow motions, proportions, and what you list. Likewise, this kind of musick
is with them who practise instruments of parts in greatest vse, but for voices it is but sildome
vsed. The next in grauery and goodnes vnto this is called a pauane, a kind of staide musicke,
ordained for graue dauncing,Pauens. and most commonlie made of three straines, whereof euerie
straine is plaid or sung twice, a straine they make to containe 8. 12. or 16. semibreues as they
list, yet fewer then eight I haue not seene in any pauan. In this you may not so much insist in
following the point as in a fantasie: but it shal be inough to touch it once and so away to some
close. Also in this you must cast your musicke by foure, so that if you keepe that rule it is no
matter howe many foures you put in your straine, for it will fall out well enough in the ende,
the arte of dauncing being come to that perfection that euerie reasonable dauncer wil make
measure of no measure, so that it is no great matter of what number you make your strayne.
After euery pauan we vsually set a galliard (that is, a kind of musicke made out of the other)
causing it go by a measure,Galliards. which the learned cal trochaieam rationem, consisting of a long and
short stroke successiuelie, for as the foote trochaeus consisteth of one sillable of two times, and
another of one time, so is the first of these two strokes double to the latter: the first beeing in
time of a semibrefe, and the latter of a minime. This is a lighter and more stirring kinde of
dauncing then the pauane consisting of the same number of straines, and looke howe manie
foures of semibreues, you put in the straine of your pauan, so many times sixe minimes must
you put in the straine of your galliard. The Italians make their galliardes (which they tearme
saltarelli) plaine, and frame ditties to them, which in their mascaradoes they sing and daunce,
and many times without any instruments at all, but in steed of instrumentes they haue Curtisans
disguised in mens apparell,Almanes. who sing and daunce to their owne songes. The Alman is a
more heauie daunce then this (fitlie representing the nature of the people, whose name it
carieth) so that no extraordinarie motions are vsed in dauncing of it. It is made of strains, somtimes
two, sometimes three, and euerie straine is made by foure, but you must marke that the
foure of the pauan measure is in dupla proportion to the foure of the Alman measure, so that
as the vsuall Pauane conteineth in a straine the time of sixteene semibreues, so the vsuall Almaine
containeth the time of eight, and most commonlie in short notes. Like vnto this is the
French bransle (which they cal bransle simple) which goeth somwhat rounder in time thē this,Bransles.
otherwise the measure is all one. The bransle de poictou or bransle double is more quick in time,
(as being in a rounde Tripla) but the straine is longer, containing most vsually twelue whole
strokes.Voltes courantes. Like vnto this (but more light) be the voltes and courantes which being both of a measure,
ar notwithstanding daunced after sundrie fashions,Countrey daunces. the volte rising and leaping, the courante
trauising and running, in which measure also our countrey daunce is made, though it
be daunced after another forme then any of the former. All these be made in straines, either
two or three as shall seeme best to the maker, but the courant hath twice so much in a straine,
as the English country daunce. There bee also many other kindes of daunces (as hornepypes
Iygges and infinite more) which I cannot nominate vnto you, but knowing these the rest can
not but be vnderstood,Diuers men diuersly affected to diuers kindes of musicke. as being one with some of these which I haue alreadie told you. And
as there be diuers kinds of musicke, so will some mens humors be more enclined to one kind
then to another. As some wilbe good descanters, and excell in descant, and yet wil be but bad
composers, others will be good composers and but bad descanters extempore vpon a plaine
song, some will excel in composition of Motets, and being set or inioyned to make a Madrigal.
                     
wil be very far from the nature of it, likewise some will be so possessed with the Madrigal
humor, as no man may be compared with them in that kind, and yet being enioyned to
compose a motet or some sad and heauy musicke, wil be far from the excellecie which they
had in their owne vaine. Lastlie, some will be so excellent in points of voluntary vpon an instrument
as one would thinke it vnpossible for him not to be a good composer, and yet being
inioynd to make a song wil do it so simplie as one would thinke a scholler of one yeares practise
might easely compose a better. And I dare boldly affirme, that looke which is hee who
thinketh himselfe the best descanter of all his neighbors, enioyne him to make but a scottish
lygge, he will grossely erre in the true nature and qualitie of it.
                  Thus haue you briefelie those preceptes which I thinke necessarie and sufficient for you,The conclusion of the dialogue.
whereby to vnderstand the composition of 3. 4. 5. or more parts, whereof I might haue spoken
much more, but to haue donne it without being tedious vnto you, that is, to mee a great
doubt seeing there is no precept nor rule omitted, which may be any way profitable vnto you
in the practise. Seeing therefore you lacke nothing of perfect musicians, but only vse to make
you prompt and quicke in your compositions, and that practise must only bee done in time,
aswell by your selues as with me, and seeing night is already begun, I thinke it best to returne,
you to your lodgings and I to my booke.

                  Tomorrow we must be busied making prouision for our iourney to the Vniuersitie,
so that we cannot possiblie see you againe before our departure, therfore we must at this time
both take our leaue of you, and intreat you that at euery conuenient occasion and your leasure
you wil let vs heare from you.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  I hope before such time as you haue sufficientlie ruminated & digested those precepts
which I haue giuen you, that you shal heare from me in a new kind of matter.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  I will not onely looke for that, but also pray you that we may haue some songes which
may serue both to direct vs in our compositions, and by singing them recreate vs after our
more serious studies.

                  As I neuer denied my schollers any reasonable request, so wil I satisfie this of yours,
therefore take these scrolles, wherein there be some graue, and some light, some of more parts
and some of fewer, and according as you shall haue occasion vse them.
               
               
                  Phi.

(which is his only hope and felicitie) then I shall these.

                  If it were possible to do any thing which might counteruaile that which you haue don
for vs, we would shew you the like fauour in doing as much for you, but since that is vnpossible
we can no otherwise requite your curtesie then by thankful minds and dewtiful reuerence
which (as all schollers do owe vnto their maisters) you shall haue of vs in such ample maner
as when we begin to be vndutifull, we wish that the worlde may know that wee cease to bee
honest.

                  Farewel, and the Lord of Lords direct you in al wisdom and learning, that when herafter
you shall bee admitted to the handling of the weighty affaires of the common wealth, you
may discreetly and worthely discharge the offices whereunto you shal be called.
               
               
                  Pol.
                  The same Lorde preserue and direct you in all your actions, and keepe perfect your

               PERORATIO.
               
                  THVS hast thou (gentle Reader) my booke after that simple sort, as I thought most conuenient for the learner,
in which if they dislike the words (as bare of eloquence and lacking fine phrases to allure the minde of
the Reader) let them consider that ornari res ipsa negat contenta doceri, that the matter it selfe denieth to bee set
out with flourish, but is contented to bee deliuered after a plaine and common maner, and that my intent in
this booke hath beene to teach musicke, not eloquence, also that the scholler wil enter in the reading of it for
the matter not for the words. Moreouer there is no man of discretion but will thinke him foolish who in the precepts of an
arte wil looke for filed speech, rethorical sentences, that being of all matters which a man can intreate of, the most humble

and with most simplicitie and sinceritie to be handled, and to decke a lowlie matter with loftie and swelling, speech wil be
to put simplicitie in plumes of feathers and a Carter in cloth of golde. But if any man of skill (for by such I loue to be censured,
contemning the iniuries of the ignorant, and making as little account of them as the moone doth of the barking of a
dog) shall thinke me either defectuous or faulty in the necessarie precepts, let him boldlie set downe in print such things as
I haue either left out or falsely set downe, which if it be done without railing or biting words against me, I wil not only take
for no disgrace, but by the contrarie esteeme of it as of a great good turne as one as willing to learne that which I know not,
as to instruct others of that which I know: for I am not of their mind who enuie the glorie of other men, but by the contrarie
giue them free course to run in the same field of praise which I haue done, not scorning to be taught, or make my profit
of their works, so it be without their praeiudice, thinking it praise enough for me, that I haue bin the first who in our tongue
haue put the practise of musick in this forme: And that I may say with Horace, Libera per vacuum posui vestigia princeps, that I
haue broken the Ice for others. And if any man shal cauil at my vsing of the authorities of other men, and thinke thereby to
discredit the booke, I am so far from thinking that any disparagement to me that I rather thinke it a greater credit. For if in
diuinity, Law, and other sciences it be not only tollerable but commendable to cite the authorities of doctors for confirmation
of their opinions, why should it not bee likewise lawfull for me to doe that in mine Arte which they commonlie vse in
theirs, and confirme my opinion by the authorities of those who haue bin no lesse famous in musicke then either Paulus,
Vlpianus, Bartolus or Baldus, (who haue made so many asses ride on foote clothes) haue beene in law. As for the examples
they be all mine own, but such of them as be in controuerted matters, though I was counsailed to take them of others, yet
to auoid the wrangling of the enuious I made them my selfe, confirmed by the authorities of the best authors extant. And
where as some may obiect that in the first part there is nothing which hath not already beene handled by some others, if
they would indifferently iudge they might answere themselues with this saying of the comicall Poet, nihil dictum quod non
dictum prius, and in this matter though I had made it but a bare translation, yet could I not haue been iustly blamed, seeing
I haue set downe such matters as haue beene hetherto vnknowne to may, who otherwise are reasonable good musicians,
but such as know least wil be readiest to condemne. And though the first part of the booke be of that nature that it coulde
not haue beene set downe but with that which others haue doone before, yet shall you not finde in any one booke all those
things which there be handled, but I haue had such an especial care in collecting them that the most common things, which
euerie where are to be had be but slenderlie touched. Other things which are as necessary & not so cōmon are more largely
handled, & also plainly & after so familiar a sort deliuered, as none (how ignorant soeuer) can iustly complaine of obscurity.
But some haue beene so foolish as to say that I haue emploied much trauell in vaine in seeking out the depth of those
moodes and other things which I haue explained, and haue not stucke to say that they be in no vse, and that I can write no
more then they know already. Surely what they know already I know not, but if they account the moodes, ligatures, pricks
of deuision and alteration, augmentation, diminution and proportious, thinges of no vse, they may as well account the
whole arte of musick of no vse, seeing that in the knowledge of them consisteth the whole or greatest part of the knowledge
of pricksong. And although it be true that the proportions haue not such vse in musicke in that forme as they be nowe vsed,
but that the practise may: be perfect without them, yet seeing they haue beene in common vse with the musicians of former
time, it is necessarie for vs to know them, if we meane to make any profit of their works. But those men who think they know
enough already, when (God knoweth) they can scarce sing their part with the wordes, be like vnto those who hauing once
superficiallie red the Tenors of Littleton or Iustinians institutes, thinke that they haue perfectlie learned the whole law, and
then being inioyned to discusse a case, do at length perceiue their own ignorance and beare the shame of their falsely conceaued
opinions But to such kind of men do I not wright, for as a man hauing brought a horse to the water cannot compel
him to drink except he list, so may I write a booke to such a man but cannot compell him to reade it: But this difference is
betwixt the horse and the man, that the horse though hee drinke not will notwithstanding returne quietly with his keeper
to the stable, and not kicke at him for bringing him fourth: our man by the contrarie will not onelie not reade that which
might instruct him, but also wil backbite and maligne him, who hath for his and other mens benefit vndertaken great labor
and endured much paine, more then for any priuat gaine or cōmoditie in particular redounding to himself. And though
in the first part I haue boldlie taken that which in particular I cannot challenge to be mine owne, yet in the second part I
haue abstained from it as much as is possible, for except the cords of descant, and that common rule of prohibited consequence
of perfect cordes, there is nothing in it which I haue seene set downe in writing by others. And if in the Canons I
shall seeme to haue too much affected breuity, you must knowe that I haue purposely left that part but slenderly handled,
both because the scholler may by his own studie become an accomplished musicion, hauing perfectly practised those fewe
rules which be there set down, as also because I do shortly looke for the publication in print, of those neuer enough praised
trauailes of master Waterhouse, whose flowing and most sweet springs in that kind may be sufficient to quench the thirst of
the most insaciate scholler whatsoeuer. But if mine opinion may be in any estimation with him, I would counsaile him that
when he doth publish his labours, he would set by euery seuerall way some words whereby the learner may perceaue it to
be a Canon, and how one of the parts is brought out of another (for many of thē which I haue seene be so intricate as being
prickt in seuerall bookes one shall hardly perceaue it to be any Canon at al): so shal he by his labors both most benefit his
Countrey in shewing the inuention of such variety, and reape most commendations to himselfe in that he hath beene the
first who hath inuented it. And as for the last part of the booke there is nothing in it which is not mine owne, and in that
place I haue vsed so great facilitie as none (howe simple soeuer) but may at the first reading conceaue the true meaning of
the words, and this haue I so much affected, because that part wil be both most vsual and most profitable to the young practicioners,
who (for the most part) know no more learning then to write their owne names. Thus hast thou the whole forme
of my booke, which if thou accept in that good meaning wherein it was written, I haue hit the marke which I shot at: if otherwise
accept my good wil, who would haue don better if I could. But if thou thinke the whole arte not worthy the pains
of any good wit or learning, though I might answere as Alfonso king of Aragon did to one of his Courtiers (who saying that
the knowledge of sciences was not requisite in a noble man, the king gaue him onelie this answere questa é voce dun bus non
dun huomo. Yet will not I take vpon me to say so, but only for remouing of that opinon, set downe the authorities of some of
the best learned of auncient time, and to begin with Plato, he in the seuenth booke of his common wealth doth so admire
musicke as that he calleth it 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   a heauenly thing, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
and profitable for the seeking out of that which is good and honest. Also in the first book of his lawes he saith that

musick cannot be intreated or taught without the knowledge of all other sciences, which if it be true, how far hath the musicke
of that time beene different from ours, which by the negligence of the prosessors is almost fallen into the nature of a
mechanicall arte, rather then reckoned in amongst other sciences. The next authoritie I may take from Aristophanes who
though he many times scoffe at other sciences, yet tearmeth he musick 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a perfect knowledge of al sciences
& disciplines. But the Authorites of Aristoxenus Ptolomaeus, & Seuerinus Boethius, who haue painefully deliuered the arte
to vs, may be sufficient to cause the best wits think it worthy their trauel, specially of Boethius who being by birth noble and
most excellent well versed in Diuinity, Philosophy, Law, Mathematicks Poetry, and matters of estate, did notwithstanding
write more of musick then of al the other mathematical sciences, so that it may be iustly said, that if it had not beene for him
the knowledge of musicke had not yet come into our Westerne part of the world. The Greeke tongue lying as it were dead
vnder the barbarisme of the Gothes and Hunnes, and musicke buried in the howels of the Greeke works of Ptolomaeus and Arirstexenus,
the one of which as yet hath neuer come to light, but lies in written copies in some Bibliothekes of Italy, the other
hath beene set out in print, but the copies are euery where so scant and hard to come by, that many doubt if he haue beene
set out or no. And these few authorities wil serue to diswade the discreet from the afore named opinion, (because few discreete
men wil hold it) as for others many will be so selfe willed in their opinions, that though a man should bring all
the arguments and authorities in the world against it, yet should he not perswade them to leaue it. But if
any man shall thinke me prolix and tedious in this place, I must for that point craue pardon, & wil
here make an end, wishing vnto all men that discretion as to measure so to other
men as they would bee measured themselues.

To the Reader.
            
               WHen I had ended my booke, and showen it (to be perused)
to some of better skill in letters then my selfe, I was by thē
requested, to giue some contentment to the learned, both by
setting down a reason why I had disagreed from the opinions
of others, as also to explaine something, which in the booke it
selfe might seeme obscure. I haue therefore thought it best to
set downe in Annotations, such things as in the text could not
so commodiouslie be handled, for interrupting of the continuall
course of the matter, that both the young beginner shoulde
not be ouerladed with those things, which at the firste woulde
be to hard for him to conceiue: and also that they who were
more skilful, might haue a reason for my proceedings. I would
therefore counsel the young scholler in Musicke, not to intangle
himselfe in the reading of these notes, til he haue perfectly
learned the booke it selfe, or at least the first part thereof: for
without the knowledge of the booke, by reading of them, hee
shal runne into such confusion, as hee shall not know where to begin or where to leaue. But thou
(learned Reader) if thou find any thing which shal not be to thy liking, in friendship aduertise me
that I may either mend it, or scrape it out. And so I ende, protesting that Errare possum haereticus esse
nolo.
            
            
               Pag. 2. vers. 26. The scale of Musicke) I haue omitted the definition and diuision of musicke because
the greatest part of those, for whose sake the booke was taken in hand, and who chieflie are
to vse it: be either altogither vnlearned, or then haue not so farre proceeded in learning, as to vnderstand
the reason of a definition: and also because amongst so many who haue written of musicke, I
knew not whom to follow in the definition. And therefore I haue left it to the discretion of ye Reader,
to take which he list of all these which I shal set downe. The most auncient of which is by Plato
set out in his Theages thus, Musicke (saith he) is a knowledge (for so I interpret the worde 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
which in that place he vseth) whereby we may rule a company of singers, or singers in companies (or
quire, for so the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                signifieth.) But in his Banquet he giueth this definition. Musick, saith
he, is a science of loue matters occupied in harmonie and rythmos. Boetius distinguisheth and theoricall
or speculatiue musicke he defineth, in the first chapter of the fift booke of his musicke, Facultas
differentias acutorum & grauium sonorum sensu as ratione perpendens. A facultie considering the difference
of high and lowe soundes by sence and reason. Augustine defineth practicall musicke
(which is that which we haue now in hand) Recto medu landi scientia, A science of well dooing by
time, tune, or number, for in al these three is modulan di peitia occupied. Franchinus gaufurius thus
Musica est proportionabilium sonorum concinnis interuallis disiunctorum dispositio sensu ac ratione
consonantiam monstrans. A disposition of proportionable soundes deuided by apt distances, shewing
by sence and reason, the agreement in sound. Those who haue byn since his time, haue doon
it thus, Rite & bene canendi scientia, A Science of duly and wel singing, a science of singing wel in
tune and number Ars bene canendi, an Art of wel singing. Now I saie, let euery man follow what
definition he list. As for the diuision, Musicke is either speculatiue or practicall. Speculatiue is that
kinde of musicke which by Mathematical helpes, seeketh out the causes, properties, and natures of
soundes by themselues, and compared with others proceeding no further, but content with the onlie

contemplation of the Art. Practical is that which teacheth al that may be knowne in songs, eyther
for the vnderstanding of other mens, or making of ones owne, and is of three kindes: Diatonicum,
chromaticum, and Enharmonicum. Diatonicum, is that which is now in vse, & riseth throughout
the scale by a whole, not a whole note and a lesse halfe note (a whole note is that which
the Latines call integer tonus, and is that distance which is betwixt any two notes, except mi & fa.
For betwixt mi and fa is not a full halfe note, but is lesse then halfe a note by a comma: and therfore
called the lesse halfe note) in this maner. 
                  〈♫〉
               
               Chromaticum, is that which riseth by se
mitonium minus (or the lesse halfe note)
the greater halfe note, and three halfe notes thus:
(the greater halfe note is that distance which is betwixt fa and mi,
                     〈♫〉
                  
               
in b fa ♮ mi.) Enharmonicum, is that which riseth by diesis, diesis,
(diesis is the halfe of the lesse halfe note) and ditonus. But in our
musicke, I can giue no example of it, because we haue no halfe of
a lesse semitonium, but those who would shew it, set downe this example. 
                  〈♫〉
               
of enharmonicum, and marke the diesis thus X as it were the halfe of the
apotome or greater halfe note, which is marked thus ♯. This signe of the
more halfe note, we now adaies confound with our b square, or signe of mi in b fa ♮ mi, and with good reason: for when mi is sung in b fa ♮ mi, it is in that habitude to alamire,
as the double diesis maketh Ffaut sharpe to Elami, for in both places the distance is a whole
note. But of this enough, and by this which is already set downe, it may euidentlie appeare, that
this kind of musick which is vsual now a daies, is not fully and in euery respect the ancient Diatonicum.
For if you begin any foure notes, singing vt re mi fa, you shal not finde either a flat in elami,
or a sharpe in Ffaut: so that it must needes follow, that it is neither iust diatonicum, nor right Chromaticum.
Likewise by that which is saide, it appeareth, this point which our Organists vse

                  〈♫〉
                is not right Chromatica, but a bastard point patched vp, of halfe chromaticke,
and halfe diatonick, Lastlie it appeareth by that which is said, that
those Virginals which our vnlearned musytians cal Chromatica (and some
also Grammatica) be not right chromatica, but halfe enharmonica: & that
al the chromatica, may be expressed vppon our common virginals, except

                  〈♫〉
                for if you would thinke that the sharpe in g sol re ut would serue that turne, by experiment
you shal find that it is more then halfe a quarter of a note too low. But lett
this suffice for the kinds of musicke: now to the parts Practical. Musicke is duided
into two parts, the first may be called Elementarie or rudimental, teaching to know
the quality and quantity of notes, and euery thing else belonging to songes, of what
maner or kind soeuer. The second may be called Syntactical, Poetical, or effectiue; treatinge of
soundes, concordes, and discords, and generally of euery thing seruing for the formal and apte setting
together of parts or soundes, for producing of harmonie either vpon a ground, or voluntarie.
            
               Pag. ad. ver. 27. Which we call the Gam) That which we cal the scale of musicke, or the Gam,
others cal the Scale of Guido: for Guido Aretinus, a Monke of the order of S. Benet, or Benedict, about
the yeare of our Lord 960. changed the Greeke scale (which consisted onely of 15. keyes, beginning
at are, and ending at alamire) thinking it a thing too tedious, to saye such long wordes, as
Proslambanomenos, hypatehypaton, and such like: turned them into Are, b mi, c fa ut, &c. and to the
intent his inuention might the longer remaine and the more easily be learned of children, hee framed
and applied his Scale to the hand: setting vppon euery ioint a seuerall keye, beginning at the
thumbes ende, and descending on the inside: then orderly through the lowest iointes of euery finger,
ascending on the little finger, and then vpon the tops of the rest, stil going about, setting his last
key ela vpon the vpper iointe of the middle finger on the outside. But to the ende that euerie one
might know from whence he had the Art, he set this Greeke letter Γ gamma, to the beginning of his
Scale, seruing for a diapason to his seuenth letter g. And whereas before him the whole Scale consisted
offoure Tetrachorda or fourthes, so disposed as the highest note of the lower, was the lowest of
the next, except that of mese, as we shal know more largely hereafter, he added a fift Tetrachordon,
including in the Scale (but not with such art and reason as the Greekes did) seauen hexachorda or
deductions of his sixe notes, causing that which before contained but fifteene notes, contain twentie,
and so fill vp both the reach of most voices, and the iointes of the hande. Some after him (or
he himselfe) altered his Scale in forme of Organ pipes, as you see set downe in the beginning of the
Booke. But the Greeke Scale was thus.
            
               
Systema harmonicum quindecim chordarum in genete diatonico.
            
            For vnderstanding of which, there be three things to be considered: the names, the numbers, and
the distances. As for the names, you must note that they be all Nounes adiectiues, the substantiue
of which is chorda, or a string, Proslabanomene, signifiesl a string assumed or taken in, the reasonne
whereof we shal straight know.
            
               
Al the scale was diuided into foure Tetrashordes or fourths, the lowest of which foure was called
Tetrachordon hypaton, the fourth of principals. The second tetrachordon meson, the fourth of middle
or meanes. The third tetrachordon diezeugmenon, the fourth of strings disioyned or disiunct. The
fourth and last tetrachordon hyperbolaeon, the fourth of stringes exceeding: the lowest string Proslambanomene
is called assumed, because it is not accounted for one of any tetrachorde, but was taken
in to be a Diapason to the mese or middle string. The tetrachorde of principals or hypaton, beginneth
in the distance of one note aboue the assumed string, containing foure strings or notes, the
last of which is Hypatemeson: the tetrachorde of meson or meanes, beginneth where the other ended
(so that one string is both the end of the former, and the beginning of the next) and containeth
likewise foure, the last whereof is mese. But the third tetrachorde, was of two maner of dispositiōs,
for either it was in the natural kind of singing, and then was it called tetrachordon diezeugmenon,
because the middle string or mese, was separated from the lowest stringe of that tetrachorde, by a
whole note, and was not accounted for any of the foure belonging to it, as you may see in the scale,
or then in the flat kind of singing: in which case, it was called tetrachordon synezeugmenon, or synemenon,
because the mese was the lowest note of that tetrachorde, all being named thus mese. Trite
synemmenon, or synezeugmenon, paranete synezeugmenon, and nete synezeugmenon. But least these
strange names, seeme fitter to coniure a spirite, then to expresse the Art, I haue thought good to
giue the names in English.

            So much for the names. The numbers set on the left side, declare the habitude (which we call proportion)
of one sound to another, as for example: the number set at the lowest note Proslambanomene,
is sesqui octaue, to that which is set before the next: and sesquitertia to that which is set at Lychanos
hypaton, & so by consideration of these numbers, may be gathered the distance of the sound
of the one from the other: as sesqui octaue produceth one whole note. Then betwixt Proslambanomene,
and hypatehypaton, is the distance of one whole note. Likewise sesquitertia, produceth a
fourth: therefore Proslambanomene and Lychanos hypaton are a fourth, and so of others. But least it
might seeme tedious, to diuide so many numbers, and seeke out the common deuisors for so many
fractions, both the distance is set downe betwixt euerie two notes, and the consonants are drawne
on the right side of the Scale. Thus much for the explanation of the table, but what vse it had, or
how they did sing is vncertaine: onely it appeareth by the names, that they tearmed the keyes of
their scale, after the stringes of some instrument, which I doubt not is the harpe. And though the
Frier Zaccone out of Franchinus affirme, that the Greekes didde sing by certaine letters, signifying
both the time that the note is to be holden in length, and also the heigth and lownesse of the same:
yet because I finde no such matter in Franchinus his Harmonia instrumentorum (for his theorica
nor Practica I haue not seene, nor vnderstand not his arguments) I knowe not what to saie to it.
Yet thus much I will saie, that such characters as Boetius setteth downe, to signifie the stringes, do
not signifie any time: for it is a great controuersie amongst the learned, if the auncient musytions
had any diuersitie of notes, but onely the signe of the chord being set ouer the word, the quantitie
or length was knowne, by that of the syllable which it serued to expresse. But to returne to Guidoes
inuention, it hath hitherto been so vsuall as the olde is gone quite out of mens memorie. And
as for the Gam, many haue vpon it deuised such fantastical imaginations, as it were ridiculous to
write, as (forsooth) Are is siluer, B mi quicksiluer, &c. for it were too long to set downe all. But
it should seeme, that he who wrote it, was either an Alcumiste, or an Alcumistes friend. Before an
old treatise of musicke written in vellim aboue an hundred yeares ago, called Regulae Franchonis cū
edditionibus Roberti de Haulo, there is a Gam set downe thus.

discourse in the dreame of Scipio, where the motions and soundes of all the sphaeres are most sweetlie
set downe: which who so listeth to read, let him also peruse the notes of Erasmus vppon that
place, where he taketh vp Gaza roundlie for his Greeke translation of it: for there Tullie doeth affirme,
that it is impossible that so great motions may be mooued without sound, and according to
theyr neerenesse to the earth, giueth he euery one a sound, the lower body the lower sounde. But
Glareanus, one of the most learned of our time, maketh two arguments to contrarie effects, gathered
out of their opinion, who denie the sound of the sphaeres.

                  The greatest bodies, saith he, make the greatest sounds,
                  The higher celestiall bodies are the greatest bodies,
                  Therefore the highest bodies make the greatest sounds.
               
The other prooueth the contrarie thus.

                  That which moueth swiftest giueth the highest sound,
                  The higher bodies moue swiftliest,
                  Therefore the highest bodies giue the highest sound.

And not without reason, though in many other thinges it hath beene called iustlie Mendax and
Nugatrix graecia. Some also (whom I might name if I would) haue affirmed, that the Scale is called

in my Lexicon, if they can proue it they shall haue it.

ignorance was called by the name of the thing signified, and so the other signe being like vnto it,
was called by the same name also.

Cliffes, because they be signes for all songes, and vse hath receiued it for a generall rule, not to sette
them in the space, because no Cliffe can be so formed as to stand in a space and touch no rule, except
the B cliffe. And therefore least any should doubt of their true standing (as for example the G
cliffe, if it stood in space and touched a rule, one might iustlie doubt, whether the Author meant
G sol re vt in Base, which standeth in space, or G sol re ut in alto which standeth on the rule) it hath
byn thought best by all the musytions, to set them in rule. Indeed I cannot denie, but that I haue
seene some Are cliffes, and others in the space: but Vna hirundo non facit ver.

               Pag. ead. vers. 34, The three natures of singing) a propertie of singing is nothing else, but the difference of plainsongs caused
by the note, in b fa ♯ mi, hauing the halfe note either aboue or belowe it, & it may plainly be seen, that those three
properties haue not byn deuised for prickt song; for you shal find no long included in so smal bounds as to touche no b.
And therefore these plainsongs which were so contained, were called naturall, because euery key of their six notes stood
inuariable the one to the other, howsoeuer the notes were named. As from d sol re, to e la mi, was alwaies a vvhole
note, whether one did sing sol la, or re mi, and so forth of others. If the b. had the semitonium vnder it, then was it noted b. & vvas
termed b. molle, or soft; if aboue it, then was it noted thus ♮ and termed b. quaratum or b. quarre. In an olde treatise called Tractatus
quatuor principalium, I find these rules and verses, Omne vt incipiens in c. cantatur per naturam. in F. per b. molle, in g. per ♮ quadratum.
that is, Euery vt beginning in C. is sung by properchant in F. by b. molle or flat, in g. by the square ♮ or sharpe, the verses be these

                  C. naturam dat. f. b molle nunc tibi signas,
                  g. quoque b. durum tu semper habes caniturum.
               
Which if they were no truer in substance then they be fine in words and right in quantitie of syllables, were not much worth. As for
the three themselues, their names beare manifest witnes, that musicke hath come to vs from the French. For if we had had it from
any other, I see no reason why we might not aswel haue said the square b. as b. quarre or carre, the signification beeing alone. In the
treatise of the foure principals I found a table, containing all the notes in the scale; and by what propertie of singing euery one is
sung, which I thought good to communicate vnto thee in English.
            
            
               
But for the vnderstanding of it, I must shew you what is meant by mutation or change. Mutation
is the leauing of one name of a note and taking another in the same sound, and is done (sayeth the
Author of quatuor principalia) either by reason of propertie, or by reason of the voice. By reason of
the property, as when you change the sol in g sol re ut, in ut, by the ♮ and in re by the ♭. & such like,
by reason of the voice when the name is changed, for the ascension or descensions sake: as for example,
in c fa ut, if you take the note fa, you may rise to the third, and fall to the fourth, in the due
order of the six notes, if the property let not. But if you would ascend to the fourth, then of force
must you change your fa, into vt, if you will not sing improperlie, because no man can ascende aboue
la, nor descend vnder vt properlie: for if he descend, he must call vt, fa. Now in those keyes
wherein there is but one note, there is no change, where two, there is double change, where three
is sextupla: but al this must be vnderstood where those three or two notes be all in one sounde, for
if they be not of one sound, they fall not vnder this rule, for they be directed by signes set by them.
But all mutation ending in vt re mi, is called ascending, because they may ascend further then descend,
and all change ending in fa sol la, is called descending, because they may descend further thē
ascend, and thereof came this verse: vt re mi scandunt, descendunt fa quoque sol la. But though, as
I said, these three properties be found in plainsong▪ yet in pricktsong they be but two: that is, either
sharp or flat, for where nature is, there no ♭. is touched. But if you would knowe whereby any note
singeth (that is whether it sing by properchant ♮ quarre, or b. molle, name the note and so come
downeward to vt: example, you woulde knowe wherby sol in g sol re ut singeth, come down thus,
sol fa mi re vt, so you find vt in c fa ut, which is the propertie whereby the sol in g sol re ut singeth,
and so by others.
            
               Page 9. verse 18. By the forme of the note) There were in old time foure maners of pricking, one al
blacke which they tearmed blacke full, another which we vse now which they called black void,
the third all red, which they called red ful, the fourth red as ours is blacke, which they called redde
void: al which you may perceiue thus: 
                  〈♫〉
               
But if a white note (which they called
black voide (happened amongste
blacke full, it was diminished
of halfe the value, so that a minime was but a crotchet, and a samibriefe a minime, &c. If a redde
full note were found in blacke pricking, it was diminished of a fourth part, so that a semibriefe was
but three crotchettes and a Redde minime was but a Crotchette: and thus you may perceiue
that they vsed their red pricking in al respects as we vse our blacke noweadaies. But that
order of pricking is gone out of vse now, so that wee vse the blacke voides, as they vsed their black
fulles, and the blacke fulles as they vsed the redde fulles. The redde is gone almost quite out of memorie,
so that none vse it, and fewe knowe what it meaneth. Nor doe we pricke anye blacke notes
amongst white, except a semibriefe thus: 
                  〈♫〉
                in which case, the semibriefe so blacke
is a minime and a pricke (though some would haue it sung in tripla maner, and
stand for 23 of a semibriefe) and the black minime a Crotchet, as indeede it is. If
more blacke semibriefes or briefes bee to gither; then is there some proportion,
& most commonly either tripla or hemiolia, which is nothing but a rounde
common tripla or sesquialtera. As for the number of the formes of notes, there were within these
two hundred yeares but foure, knowne or vsed of the Musytions: those were the Longe, Briefe,
Semibriefe, and Minime. The Minime they esteemed the least or shortest note singable, and therefore
indiuisible. Their long was in three maners: that is, either simple, double, or triple: a simple
Long was a square forme, hauing a taile on the right side hanging downe or ascending: a double
Long was so formed as some at this daie frame their Larges, that is, as it were compact of 2. longs:
the triple was bigger in quantitie than the double. Of their value we shal speake hereafter. The semibriefe
was at the first framed like a triangle thus 
                  〈☐〉
                as it were the halfe of a briefe diuided by a
diameter thus 
                  〈☐〉
                but that figure not being comly nor easie to make, it grew afterward to the figure
of a rombe or loseng thus 
                  〈☐〉
                which forme it still retaineth.
            The minime was formed as it is now, but the taile of it they euer made ascending, and called it
Signum minimitatis in their Ciceronian Latine. The inuention of the minime they ascribe to a certaine
priest (or who he was I know not) in Nauarre, or what contrie else it was which they tearmed
Nauernia, but the first who vsed it, was one Philippus de vitriaco, whose motetes for some time were
of al others best esteemed and most vsed in the Church. Who inuented the Crotchet, Quauer, and
Semiquauer is vncertaine. Some attribute the inuention of the Crotchet to the aforenamed Philip,
but it is not to be founde in his workes, and before the saide Philippe, the smallest note vsed was a
semibriefe, which the Authors of that time made of two sortes more or lesse: for one Francho diuided
the briefe, either in three equal partes (terming them semibriefes) or in two vnequal parts, the
greater whereof was called the more semibriefe (and was in value equal to the vnperfect briefe) the
other was called the lesse semibriefe, as being but halfe of the other aforesaid.
This Francho is the most ancient of al those whose workes of practical musicke haue come to my
handes, one Roberto de Haulo hath made as it were Commentaries vpon his rules, and termed thē
               
               Additions. Amongst the rest when Francho setteth downe, that a square body hauing a taile comming
downe on the right side, is a Long, he saith thus: Si tractum habeat à parte dextra ascenden
tē erecta vocatur vt hic 
               
                  〈♫〉
                
               ponuntur enim iste longae erectae ad differentiam longarum quae sunt
rectae & vocautur erecta quod vbicunque mueninutur per semitonium eriguntur, that is, If it
haue a taile on the right side going vpward, it is called erect or raised thus for these
raised longes be put for difference from others which be right, and are raised, 
                  〈♫〉
                because
wheresoeuer they be found, they be raised halfe a note higher, a thing which (I beleue)
neither he himselfe nor any other, euer saw in practise. The like obseruation he giueth of
the Briefe, if it haue a taile on the left side going vpward, the Larg, long, briefe, semibriefe, & minime
(saith Glareanus) haue these 70. yeares beene in vse: so that reckoning downeward, from Glareanus
his time, which was about 50. yeares agoe, we shal find that the greatest antiquity of our prickt
song, is not aboue 130. yeares olde.
            
               Pag. ead. verse ead. and the mood) By the name of Mood were signified many thinges in Musicke,
First those which the learned call moodes, which afterward were tearmed by the name of
tunes. Secondly a certaine forme of disposition of the Church plainsongs in longes and Breues example.
If a plainsong consisted al of Longes, it was called the first mood: if of a Long & a Briefe
successiuely, it was called the second mood, &c. Thirdly, for one of the degrees of musick, as when
we saie mood, is the dimension of Larges and Longes. And lastly, for al the degrees of Musicke, in
which sence it is commonlie (though falsly) taught to all the young Schollers in Musicke of our
time: for those signes which we vse, do not signifie any moode at all, but stretche no further then
time, so that more properly they might cal them time perfect of the more prolation, &c. then mood
perfect of the more prolation.
            
               Page ead. verse 22. The restes) Restes are of two kindes, that is: either to be told, or not to bee
tolde, those which are not to be told be alwaies sette before the song (for what purpose wee shall
know hereafter) those which are to be told for two causes cheefly were inuented. First, to giue som
leasure to the singers to take breath. The second, that the pointes might follow in Fuge one vpon
another, at the more ease, and to shew the singer how farre he might let the other goe before him
before he began to follow. Some restes also (as the minime and crotchet restes) were deuised, to
auoid the harshnesse of some discord, or the following of two perfect concords together.
            But it is to be noted, that the long rest was not alwaies of one forme: for when the long contained
three Briefes, then did the Long rest reach ouer three spaces, but when the Long was imperfect,
then the Long rest reached but ouer two spaces as they now vse them.
            
               Pag ead. vers. 25. Ligatures) Ligatures were deuised for the Ditties sake, so that how manye
notes serued for one syllable, so many notes were tied togither. Afterwards they were vsed in songs
hauing no dittie, but only for breuitie of writing: but nowadaies our songes consisting of so small
notes, few Ligatures be therein vsed: for minimes, and figures in time shorter than minimes cannot
be tied or enter in ligature. But that defect might be supplyed by dashing the signe of the degree
either with one stroke, or two, and so cause the Ligable figures serue to any smal quantitie of time
we lift. But because in the booke I haue spoken nothing of black or halfe black ligatures, I thoght
it not amisse, to set downe such as I haue found vsed by other Authors, and collected by Frier Zaceone,
in the 45. chapter of the first booke of practise of Musicke, with the resolution of the same in
other common notes.

And by these few the diligent Reader may easily collect the value of any other, wherfore I thoght
it superfluous to set downe any more, though infinite more might be found.
            
               Pag. 12. verse 6. Pricks) A pricke is a kinde of Ligature, so that if you would tie a semibrief
and a minime together, you may set a pricke after the semibriefe, and so you shal binde them. But
it is to be vnderstood, that it must be done in notes standing both in one key, else wil not the prick
augment the value of the note set before it, But if you would tie a semibriefe and a minime, or two
minimes together, which stand not both in one key, then must you vse the forme of some note ligable
(for as I tolde you before, the minime and smaller figures then it bee not ligable) and marke
the signe of degree, with what diminution is fittest for your purpose, example. There bee two minimes,
the one standing in Alamire, the other in elams: if you must needs haue them sung for one
syllable, or be tied together, then may you set them downe thus 
                  〈♫〉
                as though they wer
semibriefes, but dashing the signe of the time with a stroake of diminution to make
them minimes. But if you thinke that would not be perceiued, then may you sette
downe numbers before them thus 21 which would haue the same effect: but if that
pleased you no more thē the other then might you set them in tied briefes with this 𝇍 or this 41
signe before them, which were all one matter with the former.
            
               Page ead. verse 8. A pricke of augmentation.) Some tearme it a pricke of addition, some also a
pricke of perfection, not much amisse: but that which now is called of our musicians a prick of per
section, is altogither superfluous and of no vse in musicke: for after a semibriefe in the more prolation,
they set a pricke, though another semibriefe follow it: but though the pricke were away, the
semibriefe of it selfe is perfect. The Author of the Treatise De quatuor principalibus, saieth thus.
Take it for certaine, that the point or pricke is set in pricksong for two causes, that is, either for persection
or diuisions sake, although some haue falsly put the point for other causes, that is, for imperfections
and alterations sake, which is an absurdity to speake. But the pricke following a note,
will make it perfect, though of the owne nature it be vnperfect. Also the point is putte to deuide,
when by it the perfections (so hee tearmeth the number of three) be distinguished, and for any other
cause the point in musicke is not set downe.
So that by these his wordes it euidentlie appeareth,
that in those daies (that is about twoe hundred yeares agoe) musicke was not so farre degenerate
from theoricall reasons as it is now. But those who came after, not only made foure kinds of pricks,
but also added the fist, thus. There bee say they in all fiue kindes of pricks, a pricke of addition, a
pricke of augmentation, a pricke of perfection, a pricke of deuision, and a pricke of alteration. A
pricke of augmentation they define, that which being sette after a note, maketh it halfe as muche
longer as it was before: the pricke of Addition they define, that which being set after a sembriefe
in the more prolation, if a minime follow, it causeth the semibriefe to be three white minimes. A
pricke of perfection they define, that which being set after a semibriefe in the more prolation, if an
other semibriefe follow, it causeth the first to be perfect. The pricke of deuision and alteration they
define, as they be in my booke. But if we consider rightly both the pricke of Addition, of Augmentation,
and that of alteration, are conteined vnder that of perfection: for in the lesse prolation
when a semibriefe is two minimes, if it haue a pricke and be three, then must it bee perfect: and in
the more prolation, when two minimes come betwixt two semibriefes, or in time perfect, when
two semibriefes come betwixt two briefes which be perfect, the last of the two minimes is marked
with a pricke, and so is altered to the time of two minimes: and the laste of the twoe semibriefes is
likewise marked with a pricke, and is sung in the time of two semibriefes, which is onely done for
perfections sake, that the ternary number may be obserued: yet in such cases of alteration, som cal
that a point of diuision. For if you diuide the last semibriefe in time perfect from the briefe following,
either must you make it two semibriefes, or then perfection decaies: so that the point of alteration
may either be tearmed a point of perfection, or of diuision. But others whoe woulde seeme
very expert in musicke, haue set downe the points or pricks thus: this pricke (say they) dooth perfect
𝇋 𝆸. Now this pricke standing in this place 𝇈. 𝆸 doeth imperfect. Nowe the pricke standing
in this place 𝇈 𝆷. takes away the third part, and another pricke which standeth
vnder the note takes away the one halfe, as heere 𝆷. and like in all notes. But to refute this
mans opinion (for what or who he is I know not) I need no more then his owne words, for (saith
he) if the pricke stand thus 𝇈. 𝆸 it imperfecteth, if thus 𝇈 𝆷. it taketh away the third part of the
value. Nowe I praye him, what difference he maketh betwixt taking away the third
part of the value and imperfection? If he say (as he must needes say) that taking awaye the thirde
part of the value is to make vnperfect, then I say he hath done amisse, to make one point of imperfection,
and another of taking away the third part of a notes value.
            Againe, allimperfection is made either by a note reste or cullor, but no imperfection is made by
a pricke, therefore our Monke (or whatsoeuer he were) hath erred, in making a point of imperfection.
And lastly, all diminution is signified, either by the dashing of the signe of the degree, or by
proportionate numbers, or by a number sette to the signe, or else by asscription of the Canon: but
none of these is a pricke, therefore no diminution (for taking away halfe of the note is diminution)

is signified by a pricke, and therefore none of his rules be true sauing the first, which is, that a prick
following a blacke briefe perfecteth it.
            
               Pag. ead. vers. 16. those who) that is, Franchinus Ganforus, Peter Aron, Glareanus, and at a word
all who euer wrote of the Art of Musicke. And though they all agree in the number and forme of
degrees, yet shall you hardly finde two of them tell one tale for the signes to know them. For time
and prolation there is no controuersie, the difficultie resteth in the moodes. But to the ende that
you may the more easilie vnderstand their nature, I haue collected such rules as were requisite for
that purpose, and yet could not so well be handled in the booke. The mood therefore was signified
two maner of waies, one by numerall figures, another by pauses or restes. That way by numbers
I haue handled in my booke, it resteth to set downe that way of shewing the mood by pauses.
When they would signifie the great mood perfect, they did set downe three long restes together.
If the lesse mood were likewise perfect, then did euery one of those long restes take vp three spaces
thus 
                  〈♫〉
                but if the great mood were perfect, and the lesse mood vnperfect, then did they like
wise set downe three long Restes, but vnperfect in this maner, and though this way
bee agreeable both to experience and reason, yet hath Franchinus 
               
                  〈♫〉
                
               Ganforus sette
downe the signe of the great mood perfect thus, 
                  〈♫〉
                of the great moode vnperfect
he setteth no sign, except one would say that this is it 
                  〈♫〉
               
for when he sets downe that mood, there is such a dashe before it, touching all the fiue
lines. But one may iustlye doubt if that bee the signe of the mood, or some stroke set at
the beginning of the lines. But that signe which he maketh of the great moode perfect, that
doth Peter Aron set for the great mood imperfect, if the lesse mood be perfect But (saith he) This
is not of necessity, but according as the composition shall fal to be, the lesse mood perfect not being
ioyned with the great mood imperfect. So that when both moodes be imperfect, then is the
signe thus 
                  〈♫〉
                And thus much for the great mood. The lesse moode is often considered and the
great left out, in which case if the smal mood be perfect it is signified thus 
                  〈♫〉
                if it be vnperfect,
then is there no pause at all set before the song, nor yet any cifer, and that betokeneth
both 
                  〈♫〉
                moodes vnperfect; so that it is most manifest, that our common signes which
we vse, haue no respect to the moodes, but are contained within the boundes of 
                  〈♫〉
                time and prolation.
            
               Pag. 14 ver. 10. In this mood it is alwaies imperfect) That is not of necessity, for if you putte a
point in the center of the circle, then will the prolation be perfect, and the Large be worth 81. minimes,
and the Long 27. the briefe nine, and the semibriefe three: so that moodes great and small,
time, and prolation, wil altogether be perfect.
            
               Pag. 18. ver. 11. Perfect of the more) This (as I said before) ought rather to be tearmed time perfect
of the more prolation, then mood perfect, and yet hath it been receiued by consent of our English
practicioners, to make the Long in it three briefes, and the Large thrice so much. But to this
day could I neuer see in the workes of any, either strangers or Englishmen, a Long set for 3. briefes
with that signe, except it had either a figure of three, or then modal rests sette before it, Zar. vol. 1.
part. 3. cap. 67. Zacc. lib. 2 cap. 14. But to the end that you may know when the restes be to be told,
and when they stand only for the signe of the mood you must marke if they bee set thus, 
                  〈♫〉
               
in which case they are not to be told: or thus 
                  〈♫〉
                and then are they to bee numbred.
Likewise you must make no accompte whether they be set thus 
                  〈♫〉
               
or thus 
                  〈♫〉
                for both those be one thing signifieng both moods perfect.
            
               Pag. 8. ver. 18. The perfect of the lesse) This first caused me to doubt of the certainty of those rules
which being a childe I had learned, for whereas in this signe I was taught, that euery Large was 3.
Longes, and euery Long three Briefes, I finde neither reason nor experience to proue it true. For
reason (I am sure) they can alledge none, except they will vnder this signe 𝇈 comprehende both
mood and time, which they can neuer proue. Yet doe they so sticke to their opinions, that when
I told some of them (who had so set it downe in their bookes) of their error, they stoode stiffelie to
the defence thereof, with no other argument, then that it was true. But if they will reason by experience,
and regard how it hath beene vsed by others, let them looke in the masse of M. Tauerner,
called Gloria tibi trinitas, where they shall finde examples enough to refute their opinion, and confirme
mine. But if they thinke maister Tauerner partiall, let them looke in the workes of our English
doctors of musicke, as D. Farfax, D. Newton, D. Cooper, D. Kirby, D. Tie, and diuers other
excellent men, as Redford, Cornish, Piggot, White, and M. Tallis. But if they will trust none of all
these, here is one example which was made before any of the aforenamed were borne.

And this shal suffice at this time for the vnderstanding of the controuerted moods. But to the ende
thou mayst see how many waies the moods may be diuersly ioyned, I haue thought good to shew
thee a table, vsed by two good musytians in Germany, and approued by Fryer Lowyes Zaccone, in

            But by the way you must note, that in all Moodes (or rather signes) of the more prolation, he setteth
a minime for a whole stroke, and proueth it by examples out of the masse of Palestin, called l'home
armè. There is also another way of setting downe the degrees, which because I had not seen practised
by any Musition, I was determined to haue passed in silence. But because some of my friends
affirmed to me, that they had seen them so set down, I thought it best to shew the meaning of thē.
The auncient Musytians, who grounded all their practise vpon Speculation, did commonlie sette
downe a particular signe for euery degree of musycke in the song: so that they hauing no more degrees
then three, that is, the two moods & time (prolation not being yet inuented) set down three
signes for them, so that if the great moode were perfect, it was signified by a whole circle, which
is a perfect figure: if it were imperfect, it was marked with a halfe circle, Therefore, wheresoeuer
these signes 𝇇3 were set before any songe, there was the greate moode perfect signified by the
circle. The small mood perfect signified by the first figure of three, and time perfect signified
by the last figure of three. If the song were marked thus 𝇋33, then was the great mood vnperfect,
and the smal mood and time perfect. But if the first figure were a figure of two thus 𝇋23, then
were both moods vnperfect and time perfect: but if it were thus 𝇋22, then were all vnperfect.

But if in al the song there were no Large, then did they set downe the signes of such notes as were
in the song: so that if the circle or semicircle were set before one onelie cifer, as 𝇈2 then did it
signifie the lesse mood, and by that reason that circle now last sette downe with the binarie
cipher following it, signified the lesse mood perfect, and time vnperfect. If thus 𝇊3 then was the
lesse mood vnperfect and time perfect. If thus 𝇋2. then was both the lesse mood and time vnperfect,
and so of others. But since the prolation was inuented, they haue set a pointe in the circle or
halfe circle, to shew the more prolation, which notwithstanding altereth nothing in the mood nor
time. But because (as Peter Aron saith) these are little vsed now at this present, I will speake no
more of it, for this wil suffice for the vnderstanding of any song which shal be so markt: and whosoeuer
perfectly vnderstandeth and keepeth that which is already spoken, wil finde nothing pertaining
to the moodes to be hard for him to perceiue.
            
               Pag. 12. line 9 Augmentation.) If the more prolation be in one part with this signe 𝇇 and the
lesse in the other with this 𝇈 then is euery perfect semibriefe of the more prolatiō worth three of
the lesse: and euery vnperfect semibriefe (that is, if it haue a minime following it) worth twoe,
and the minime one. But if the lesse prolation be in the other parts with this signe 𝇊 euerye perfect
semibriefe of the more prolation is worth six of the lesse, and the vnperfect semibriefe
worth foure, and euery minime two, as in the example of Iulio Rinaldi, set at the ende of the firste
part of the booke after the proportions, may be perceiued.
            
               Pag. 27. vers. 18. Proportion is) When any two things of one kind, as two numbers, two lines
of such like are compared together, each of those two things so compared, is of the Greeks called

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , which Boetius interpreteth in Latine Terminus, in English we haue no proper worde to signifie
it. But some keepe the Latin, and cal it Tearme: and that comparison of those two things is called
of the Greeks 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is as the Latins say, Ratio & habitudo, in English we haue no
word to expresse those two. But hitherto we haue abusiuely taken the worde proportion in that
sence. What proportion is we shall know hereafter, but with what English worde soeuer wee expresse
those ratio and habitudo, they signifie this, how one terme is in quantity to another: as if you
compare 3, & 6 togither, and consider howe they are to another, there will bee twoe tearmes
the first three, and the latter sixe, and that comparison and as it were respect of the one vnto the
other, is that ratio & habitudo which wee spake of. Now these things which are compared together,
are either aequal one to another, as fiue to fiue, an elle to an elle, an aker to an aker, &c. & then
is it called aequalitatis ratio, respect of aequalitie, which we falsly tearme proportion of aequality, or
then vnaequal, as three to sixe, a handbredth to a foot, &c. in which case it is called inaequalis, or
inaequalitatis ratio. Now this respect of equalitie is simple, and alwaies one, but that of inaequalitie
is manifold: wherefore it is diuided into many kindes, of which some the Greekes terme 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
and othersome 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Those kindes they tearme 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , wherein the greater terme is compared
to the lesse, as six to three, which of the late barbarous writers, is tearmed proportion of the
greater inaequalitie: and by the contrary, those kindes they tearme 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , where the lesse terme
is compared to the greater, as 4. to six, which they terme the lesse inaequalitie. Of eache of these
two kinds there be found fiue species or formes, three simple and two compound. The simple prologa
as multiplex superparticular, and superpartient compound. Prologa ar multiplex superparticular
& multiplex superpartient. Multiplex ratio, is when the greater terme doth so conteine the lesse,
as nothing wanteth or aboundeth, as ten and fiue: for ten doth twice containe fiue precisely, & no
more nor lesse, of which kinde there bee many formes. For when the greater containeth the lesse
twise, then is it called Dupla ratio, if thrise tripla, if foure times quadrupla, and so infinitely. Superparticularis
ratio, which the Greeks call 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , is when the greater terme containeth the lesse
once with some one part ouer, which one part, if it be the halfe of the lesser terme, then is the respect
of the greater to the lesser called sesquiplex, and sesqnialtera ratio, as three to two. If it be the third
part, it is called sesquitertia, as foure to three: if it be the fourth part, it is called sesquiquarta, as fiue
to foure, and so of others. Superpartiens which the learned called 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , is when the greater
terme containeth the lesse once, and some partes besides, as fiue doth comprehend three once,
and moreouer, two third parts of 3. which are two vnities, for the vnity is the thirde part of three.
and ten comprehendeth six once, and besides two third parts of 6, for 2, is the third part of sixe: in
which case it is called ratio superbipartiens tertias, and so of others according to the number and
names of the partes which it containeth. Multiplex superparticulare, is when the greater tearme
comprehendeth the lesse more then once, and besides some one part of it, as 9 to 4, is dupla sesquiquarta,
because it containeth it twise. And moreouer, one fourth part of it. Likewise 7 is to 2. tripla
sesqui altera, that is multiplex, because it containeth 2 of ten, that is thrice: and superparticular,
because it hath also a halfe of two: that is one, and so of others: for of this kind there be as manye
formes as of the simple kindes multiplex and superparticular. Multiplex superpartiens, is easily
knowne by the name, example 14 to 5. is multiplex superpartiens. Multiplex, because it contayneth
5 twise, and superpartiens, because it hath foure sift parts more, and so 14 to 5 is dupla superqua
dispartiens quint as, for of this kind there be so many formes as of multiplex and superpartiens. Thus
you see that two termes compared togither, containe ratio, habitudo respecte, or howe else you liste
to terme it. But if the termes be more then two, and betwixt them one respect or more, then doe
the Greekes by the same word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , tearme it 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the Latines call it Proportio, and define

it thus, Proportio est rationum similitudo. And Aristotle in the fift booke of his Morals. ad Nicomachum,
defineth it Rationum aequalitas, as for example. Let there be three numbers, whereof the first hath double
respect to the second, & the second double respect to the third thus, 12, 6, 3. these or any such like make
proportion or Analogie. The Arithmeticians set downe in their bookes many kinds of proportions, but
we wil touch but those three which are so common euerye where in the workes of those chiefe Philosophers
Plato and Aristotle, and be these, Geometrical, Arithmetical, and Harmonical. Geometricall proportion
(which properly is proportion) is that which two or more aequal habitudes do make, as I shewed
you euen now, and is either coniunct or disiunct. Coniunct proportion, is when the middle tearme is twice
taken thus, as 16 to 8, so are 8 to 4, and 4 to 2, and 2 to 1, for here is euery where double habitude, Disiunct
proportion, is when the middle termes bee but once taken thus, as 16 to 8, so 6 to 3. Arithmeticall
proportion, is when between twoe or more termes is the same, not habitude but difference, as it is in the
natural disposition of numbers thus, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: for here euery tearme passeth other, by one only, or thus,
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, where euery number passeth other, by two, or any such like. But Harmonical proportion
is that, which neither is made of aequal habitudes, nor of the like differences: but when the greatest of three
termes is so to the least as the differences of the greatest and middle termes, is to the difference of the middle
and least example. Here be three numbers 6 4 3. whereof the first twoe are in sesquialtera habitude,
and the latter two are in sesquitertia: you see here is neither like habitude, nor the same differences,
for foure is more then three by one, and six is more then four by two: but take the difference betwixt
six and foure, which is two, and the difference of 4 and 3. which is 1, and compare the differences together,
you shal find two to 1, as 6 is to 3, that is dupla habitude. And this is called harmonical proportion,
because it containeth the habitudes of the Consonantes amongest themselues: as, Let there bee three
lines taken for as many stringes or Organ-pipes, let the first be six foot long, the second foure, the thirde
three: that of sixe wil be a diapason or eight to that of three, and that of four wil be a diapente or fift aboue
that of sixe, thus:
            
               
Thus you see what proportion is, and
that proportion is not properlie taken
in that sence wherein it is vsed in the
booke: yet was I constrained to vse that
word for lacke of a better. One whose
booke came lately from the presse, called
the Pathwaie to Musicke, setting
downe the proportions, calleth them a
great proportion of inequality, & a lesse
proportion of inequalitie: and a little
after treating of dupla, he setteth down
words which hee hath translated out of
Lossius his Musicke, but it seemeth hee
hath not vnderstood too well, for (saith
he) dupla is that which taketh from all
notes and rests the halfe value, &c. and
giueth this example:

                  〈♫〉
               
               
                  〈♫〉
               
            
            
               
                  〈♫〉
                But if he had vnderstoode
what
he said, he would
neuer haue sette
down this for an

                  〈♫〉
                example, or else
he hath not knowen
what a minim
or a crotchet
is. But if I might, I would aske him of what length he maketh euery note of the plainsong? I knowe hee
will answer of a semibriefe timeh. Then if your plainsong be of a semibriefe time, how will two minimes
being diminished, make vp the time of a whole semibriefe? A minime in dupla proportion beeing but a

Crotchet. O but (saith he) the plainsong note is likewise diminished, and so the diminished minims wil
make vp the time of a diminished semibriefe. But then how wil one barre of your partition make vppe a
full stroke? seeing in the lesse prolation a minime is neuer taken for a whole stroke. Againe, no diminution
is euer knowne, but where the signes of diminution be set by the notes, and except you sette the numbers
in both partes, diminution wil not be in both parts. But to conclude, he who set downe that example,
either knew not what dupla was, or then vnderstood not what he himselfe said, which appeareth in
many other places of his booke: as for example, in the tenth page (leauing out the leafe of the title) A
perfect sound (saith he) containeth a distance of two perfect soundes. What would he say by this? in mine opinion
he would say A perfect second containeth a distance of two perfect soundes. Yet I know not what he
meaneth by a perfect sound: for any sound is perfect not compared to another, and though it were compared
to another, yet is the sound perfect, though it be not a perfect consonant to the other. But our master
who shewes such Pathwaies to Musicke, would say this, A perfect second conteineth a whole note (or as
the Latines tearme it integer tonus) as from vt tore, is a whole note, &c. In the beginning of the next page,
he saith, An vnperfect second a sound and a halfe: but I pray you good M. Guide of the Pathway, howe can
you make that a sound (for so you interpret the word tonus) and a halfe, which is not full a halfe sound or
halfe a tonus? But if you had vnderstood what you saide, you would haue said thus: An vnperfect seconde
conteineth but a lesse halfe note, as is euer betwixt mi and fa. Also defining what diatessaron, or a fourth is,
he saith, a fourth is the distance of the voice by a fourth. And likewise, a fift the distance of the voice by a fift.
Notable definitions: as in the play, the page asking his maister what a Poet was, he, after a great pause &
long studie, answered that it was a Poet. Likewise, giuing the definition of a note, he saith it is a signe shewing
the lowdnesse or stilnesse of the voice, but these be light faultes to those which follow after. For the Ligatures
are set downe false, and comming to speake of the Moodes, or degrees of musicke, he maketh no
mention at all of the lesse mood. And defining time he saith, it is a formall quantity of semibriefes measuring
them by three or by two: and prolation he calleth a formall quantity of minimes and semibriefes, and shewing
time perfect of the lesse prolation, he setteth it downe thus.

                  〈♫〉
               
And in the imperfect of the more prolation, he maketh two minimes to the semibriefe. But I am almoste
out of my purpose, following one quam vincere inglorium & 
                     ••
                  quo atteri sordidum: For if you read his book
you may say by it, as a great Poet of our time said by anothers, Vix est in toto pagina sana libr. What, said
I vix? Take away two or three scales which are filched out of Beurhusius, and fill vp the three first pages
of the booke, you shal not finde one side in all the booke without some grosse errour or other. For as hee
setteth downe his dupla, so dooth he all his other proportions, giuing true definitions and false examples,
the example still importing the contrary to that which was said in the definition. But this is the Worlde.
Euery one will take vpon him to write, and teach others, none hauing more need of teaching then himselfe.
And as for him of whom we haue spoken so much, one part of his booke he stole out of Beurhusius,
another out of Lossius, peruerting the sence of Lossius his wordes, and giuing examples flatte to the contrary,
of that which Lossius saith. And the last part of his booke treating of Descant, he tooke verbatim
out of an old written booke which I haue. But it should seeme, that whatsoeuer or whosoeuer he was, that
gaue it to the presse, was not the Author of it himselfe, else would he haue set his name to it, or then hee
was ashamed of his labour.
            
               Pag. 27. vers. 40. Dupla) I cannot imagine how the teachers (which these 30, or 40, years past haue
taught) should so farre haue strayed from the truth, as for no reason to call that common sort of Musick,
which is in the time vnperfect of the lesse prolation dupla, or that it is in dupla proportion, except they
would say, that any two to one is dupla: which none (at least who is in his right wits) will affirme. For
when proportion is, then must the things compared be of one kind: as one aker to two akers is in subdupla
proportion, &c. So when you see dupla set downe, you must sing euery note so faste againe as it was
before. Glareanus giueth this example of dupla out of Franchinus, which because it hath some difficulty,
I thought good to set downe and explaine in this place.

                  〈♫〉
               
               
                  〈♫〉
               
            
            
               
The signe at the beginning sheweth time perfect, so that euery briefe not hauing a semibriefe after it is
three semibriefes, and so being diminished of halfe their value in dupla proportion, are but three minimes
a peece: those briefes which in dupla haue a semibrife following them, are sung but in time of one semibriefe,
the signe of imperfect time comming in after the proportion destroyeth it, but these numbers 42
being the notes of dupla habitude, following within foure notes, make vp the proportion againe: but
in the latter dupla, you must marke that the diminished briefe is lesse by a whole minime then it was in the
former, because the first followed time perfect, and the halfe of a briefe in time perfect, is three minimes,
the latter followed time imperfect, and the halfe of a briefe in time vnperfect, is a semibriefe or twoe minimes.
Likewise you must note, that when dupla or any, other proportion is in all the partes alike, then
can it not be called proportion, seeing there is no comparison of notes together, according to any imparity
of numbers.
            
               Pag. 29. vers. 3. Tripla) This is the common hackney horse of al the Composers, which is of so manie
kindes as there be maners of pricking, sometimes al in blacke notes, sometimes all in white notes, sometimes
mingled, sometimes in briefes, sometimes al in semibriefes, and yet all one measure. But one thing
I mislike (though it be in common vse with vs all) that is, when wee call that tripla wherein al the voices
goe together in one time with the stroke of sesquialtera time, or three minimes for a stroke, for that is no
tripla, but as it were a sesquialtera compared to a sesquialtera: and whereas wee commonly make tripla
with three minimes for a stroke, we confound it with sesquialtera. Lastly, true tripla maketh three Semibriefes
or their value in other notes to the time of one semibriefe, whereof Glareanus giueth this example
out of Coclaeus.
               
                  〈♫〉
               
               
                  〈♫〉
               
            
            But this tripla is double as swift in stroke as our common tripla of three minims, which though I haue vsed
and stil doe vse, yet am not I able to defend it by reason: so that if any man would change before mee, I
would likewise willingly change, but of my selfe I am loth to breake a receiued custome. But one may
aske me, if our common tripla be not a proportion, what it is? I will answere out of Glareanus, that it seemeth
to be a kind of perfection flourished by Art, and different from the auncient and first kind of order,
because in it, both imperfection and alteration haue place. And by this, which in dupla and tripla is spoken,
may all other things concerning proportions of multiplicity be easily vnderstoode, therfore one word
of sesqui altera, and then an ende of this first part.
            
               Pag. 31. verse 9. Sesquialtera) Sesquialtera, is a musical proportion, wherin three notes are sung in the
time of two of the same kinde, or rather thus. Sesquialtera, is a kinde of musicall diminution, wherein 3.
semibriefes or their value in other notes are sung for two strokes. But you may obiect and say, If that be
true sesquialtera, what difference do you make betwixt it and the more prolation? Only this, that in the
more prolation, a perfect semibriefe maketh vppe a whole stroke and likewise the value of a semibriefe:
but in sesquialtera, the value of a semibriefe and a halfe doe but make one stroke, and a semibriefe of it
selfe neuer maketh a stroke. And by this it appeareth, that our common tripla of three minimes is false,
which is confounded both with the more prolation and sesquialtera. Therefore take that for a sure and
infallible rule which I haue set down in my book, that in all musical proportions the vpper number signifieth
the semibriefe, and the lower the stroke, so that if the proportion be noted thus 32 three semibriefes or the value
of three semibriefes must go to two strokes, but if thus 23 then must tvvoe semibriefes or their value
make three whole strokes. And let this suffice for the pro portions. As for Sesquitertia, sesquiquarta and
such like, it were folly to make many wordes of them, seeing they be altogether out of vse, and it is a matter
almost impossible to make sweet musicke in that kind. Yet is sesquitertia one of the hardest proportions
which can be vsed, and carieth much more difficulty then sesquiquarta, because it is easier to diuide a
semibriefe into foure aequal parts, then into three: nor haue I euer seene an example of true sesquitertia
sauing one, which Lossius giueth for an example, and pricketh it in Longs, making them but three stroks
a peece, and the briefes one and a halfe: in semibriefes it is very hard, and almost impossible to vse it, but
according to our manner of singing, if one part sing sesquialtera in Crotchets, and another sing Quauers
in the lesse prolation, whereof eight go to a stroke, then would we say that that were eight to sixe, which
is sesquitertia.
            
            But if I should go about to say al that may be spoken of the proportions, I might bee accounted one

who knew not how to employ my time, and therefore I wil conclude with one worde, that proportions
of multiplicitie might be had and vsed in any kinde without great scruple or offence: but those superparticulars
and superpartients carry great difficultie, and haue crept into musick I know not how, but it shold
seeme, that it was by meanes of the Descantors, who striuing to sing harder waies vpon a plainsong then
their fellowes, brought in that which neither could please the eares of other men, nor could by thēselues
be defended by reason. Here was I determined to haue made an ende, but some more curious then discreet,
compelled me to speake some words more, and to giue a reason why, after the proportions I haue
saide nothing of the inductions. And therefore to be briefe, I say that all which they can say of these inductions,
is nothing but meere foolishnesse, & commenta otiosorum hominum qui nihil aliud agunt nisi ut iniuniant
quomodo in otio negotiosi videantur. Yet I maruel, that a thinge which neither is of any vse, nor yet
can be prooued by any reason, should so much be stood vpon by them, who take vpon them to teach the
youth nowadaies. But yet to refute it I need no other argument then this, that not any one of them who
teach it, deliuereth it as another doth. But to be plaine, those inductions be no other thinge (as I saide in
my booke, pag. 92. ver. 7) but that number which any greater notes broken in smaller do make, as for example
(though their opinions be false) sesquialtera or pricke semibriefe is the induction to their tripla,
for sing your sesquialtera in minimes, and you shall find three of them to a stroke. Likewise, breake eyther
your tripla of three minimes or your pricke semibriefe into crotchets, and so shall the prick semibrief
bee the induction to sextupla as they say, but this is so false as what is falsest: for in whatsoeuer notes you
sing sesquialtera, it is alwaies sesquialtera, because the value of a semibriefe and a halfe doth alwaies make
a full stroke. Breake true tripla in minimes it will make their sextupla, make it in crotchets, it will make
their duodecupla, and this is it which they call their inductions, which it shal be enough for the scholler to
vnderstand when he heareth them named: for no musician (if he can but breake a note) can misse the true
vse of them. It resteth now to giue a reason why I haue placed that table of proportions in my book, seeing
it belongeth no more to musicke, then any other part of Arithmeticke doth (Arithmeticke you must
not take here in that sence as it is commonly for the Art of calculation, but as it is taken by Euclide, Nicomachus,
Boetius and others) but the reason why I set it there, was to helpe the vnderstanding of manye
young practicioners, who (though they see a song marked with numbers, as thus for example) yet doe
they not know what proportion that is. And therefore if they doe but look vpon 3 the numbers, & marke
the concourse of the lines in closing them, they shall there plainly finde set downe, what relation one of
those numbers hath to another.
            
               Vpon the second Part.
               
                  Pag. 70 ver. 22. The name of descant) This part is the second member of our deuision of practical musicke,
which may be properly tearmed syntactical, poeticall, or effectiue: and thoughe I dare not affirme
that this part was in vse with the musicians of the learned age of Ptolomaus, or yet of that of Boetius: yet
may I with some reason say, that it is more auncient then pricksong, and only by reason of the name which
is contrapunto an Italian word deuised since the Gothes did ouerrun Italy, and changed the Latine tounge
into that barbarisme which they now vse. As for the word it selfe, it was at that time fit enough to expres
the thing signified, because no diuersity of notes being vsed, the musicians in stead of notes did set downe
their musicke in plaine prickes or pointes: but afterwards that custome being altered by the diuersity of
formes of notes, yet the name is retained amongst them in the former signification, though amongst vs it
be restrained from the generality, to signifie that species or kind, which of all others is the most simple &
plaine, and in stead of it we haue vsurped the name of descant. Also by continuance of time, that name
is also degenerated into another signification, and for it we vse the word setting or composing. But to leaue
setting and composing, and come to the matter which now we are to intreat of, the word descant signifieth
in our toung, the forme of setting together of sundry voices or concords for producing of harmony: and a
musician if he heare a song sung and mislike it, he will saie the Descant is naught. But in this signification
it is seldome vsed, and the most common signification which it hath, is the singing ex tempore vpon a plain
song: in which sence there is none (who hath tasted the first elements of musicke) but vnderstandeth it.
When descant did begin, by whom and where it was inuented is vncertaine, for it is a great controuersie
amongst the learned if it were knowne to the antiquitie, or no. And diuers do bring arguments to proue,
and others to disproue the antiquity of it: and for disprouing of it, they say that in all the workes of them,
who haue written of musicke before Franchinus, there is no mention of any more parts then one, and that
if any did sing to the harpe (which was their most vsuall instrument) they sung the same which they plaied.
But those who would affirme that the auncients knew it, saie: That if they did not know it, to what
ende serued all those long and tedious discourses and disputations of the consonantes wherein the moste
part of their workes are consumed? But whether they knew it or not, this I wil say, that they had it not in
halfe that variety wherein we now haue it, though we read of much more strange effects of their musick
then of ours.
               
                  Pag. ead. vers. 29. Interualla both concords and discords) The Printer not conceiuing the words concordes
and discords to be adiectiues, added the word of peruerting the sence, but if you dash out that word▪
                  
the sence will be perfect. As for the Consonants or concordes, I doe not thinke that anye of those which
wee call vnperfect cords, were either in vse or acknowledged for Consonants, in the time of those whoe
professed musicke before Guido Aretinus, or of Guido himselfe. Boethius setting downe the harmonicall
proportions and the Consonants which arise of them, talketh of quadrupla, tripla, dupla, sesquialtera, and
sesquitertia, which make disdiapason, diapente cum diapason, diapason, diapente, and diatessaron, or as we say,
a fifteenth, a twelfe, an eight, a fift, & a fourth. But why they should make diatessaron a Consonant, seeing it
mightily offendeth the eare, I see no reason, except they woulde make that Geometricall rule of paralell
lines true in consonants of musicke: Quae sunt vni & eidem parallelae, sunt etiam inter se parallelae, & so make
those fouds which to one and the selfesame are consonants, to be likewise consonantes amongste themselues.
But if any man would aske me a reason why some of those consonants which we vse are called perfect,
and othersome vnperfect, I can giue him no reason, except that our age hath tearmed those Consonantes
perfect, which haue beene in continuall vse since musicke began: the others they tearme vnperfect,
because they leaue in the minde of the skilfull hearer, a desire of comming to a perfect chord. And it
is a ridiculous reason which some haue giuen, that these be vnperfect cordes, because you may not begin
nor ende vpon them. But if one should aske why you may not begin nor end vpon them, I see no reason
which might be giuen except this, that they be vnperfect chords: so that in mine opinion, it is a better reason
to say you may not begin nor end vpon them, because they be vnperfect chords, then to say that they
be vnperfect, because you may not begin nor end vpon them. And if the custome of musicians should suffer
it to come in practise, to begin and end vpon them, should they then becom perfect chords? No verily.
For I can shew many songes composed by excellent menne (as Orlando de lassus, M. White, and others)
which begin vpon the sixt: and as for the thirde, it was neuer counted any fault, either to begin or end vpon
it: and yet will not any man say, that the third is a perfect chord. But if mine opinion might passe for a
reason, I would say that al sounds contained in habitude of multiplicity, or superparticularity, were of the
olde musicians esteemed consonantes, which was the cause that they made the diatessaron a Consonant,
although it were harsh in the eare: The tonus or whole note is indeed comprehended vnder superparticular
habitude, that is sesquioctaua, but it they counted the beginning of consonance, and not a consonant it
selfe. The sesquitonus, ditonus, semitonium cum diapente, and tonus cum diapente, (that is our flat and sharp
thirdes and sixes) they did not esteeme consonants, because they were not in habitude of multiplicity or
superparticularity, but vnder superpartients: the first and second between sesquitertia & sesquiquarta, the
third and fourth betweene sesquialtera and dupla. But of this matter enough in this place, if anye desire
more of it, let him read the third booke of Iacobus Faber stapulersis his musicke. The second part of Zarlino
his harmonicall institutions, and Franchinus his Harmonia instrumentorum. As for singing vppon a
plainsong, it hath byn in times past in England (as euery man knoweth) and is at this day in other places,
the greatest part of the vsuall musicke which in any churches is sung. Which indeed causeth me to maruel
how men acquainted with musicke, can delight to heare such confusion as of force must bee amongste so
many singing extempore. But some haue stood in an opinion which to me seemeth not very probable, that
is, that men accustomed to descanting will sing together vpon a plainsong, without singing eyther false
chords or forbidden descant one to another, which til I see I will euer think vnpossible. For though they
should all be moste excellent men, and euery one of their lessons by it selfe neuer so well framed for the
ground, yet is it vnpossible for them to be true one to another, except one man shoulde cause all the reste
sing the same which he sung before them: and so indeed (if he haue studied the Canon before hand) they
shall agree without errors, else shall they neuer do it. It is also to be vnderstood, that when they did sing
vpon their plainsongs, he who sung the ground would sing it a sixt vnder the true pitche, and sometimes
would breake some notes in diuision, which they did for the more formall comming to their closes: but
euery close (by the close in this place, you must vnderstand the note which serued for the last syllable of euery
verse in their hymnes,) he must sing in that tune as it standeth, or then in the eight below: & this kind
of singing was called in Italy Falso bordone, and in England a Faburden, whereof here is an example, first
the plainsong, and then the Faburden.

And though this be prickt a third aboue the plainsong, yet was it alwaies sung vnder the plainsong. Other
things handled in this part of the booke, are of themselues easily to be vnderstood. Therefore I will cease

                  Page 147. verse 17. The eight tunes) The tunes (which are also called modi musici) the practioners
do define, to be a rule whereby the melodie of euery song is directed. Now these tunes arise out of the tunes of
the eight, according to the diuersity of setting the fift and fourth together, for the fourth may be set in the
eight, either aboue the fift, which is the harmonicall diuision or mediation (as they tearme it) of the eight,
or vnder the fift, which is the Arithmeticall mediation: and seeing there be seauen kindes of eights, it followeth
that there be 14. seuerall tunes, euery eight making two. But of these fourteene (saith Glareanus)
the musicians of our age acknowledge but eight though they vse thirteen, some of which are in more vse,
and some lesse vsual then others. And these eight which they acknowledge, they neither distinguish trulie,
nor set downe perfectly, but prescribe vnto them certaine rules which are neither generall, nor to the
purpose, but such as they be, the effect of them is this. Some tunes (say they) are of the odde number, as
the first, third, fift and seuenth: others of the euen number: as the second, fourth, sixt and eight: the odde
they call Autentas, the euen Plagales. To the autentas they giue more liberty of ascending then to the
Plagale, which haue more liberty of descending then they, according to this verse,
Vult descendere par, sed scandere vult modus impar
Also for the better helping of the schollers memory, they haue deuised these verses following.

                     Impare de numero tonus est autentas, in altum
                     Cuius neuma salit sede apropria diapason
                     Pertingens, à qua descendere vix datur illi;
                     Vult pare de numero tonus esse plagalis in ima
                     Ab regione sua descendens addiatesron,
                     Cui datur ad quint am, raróq, ascendere sextam.
                  
Now these tunes consisting of the kinds of diapason or eights, it followeth to know which tunes ech kind
of diapason doth make. It is therefore to be vnderstood, that one eight hauing but one diapente or fift, it
followeth, that one diapente must be common to two tunes, the lowest key of which diapente ought to
be the finall key of thē both. It is also to be noted, that euery autenta may go a whole eight aboue the final
key, and that the Plagale may go but a fift aboue it, but it may goe a fourth vnder it, as in the verses nowe
set downe is manifest. So then the first tune is from dsolre to dlasolre, his fift being from dsolre to Alamire.
The second tune is from Alamire to Are, the fift being the same which was before, the lowest key of which
is common finall to both. In like maner, the third tune is from elami to elami, and the fourth from b fa ♭
mi to ♮ mi, the diapente from elami to b fa ♭ mi, being common to both. Now for the discerning of these
tunes one from another, they make three waies, the beginning, middle, and ende: and for the beginning
say they, euery song which about the beginning riseth a fift aboue the finall key, is of an autenticall tune:
if it rise not vnto the fifth it is a plagall. And for the middle, euery song (say they) which in the middle
hath an eight aboue the final keye, is of an autenticall tune: if not it is a plagal. And as for the ende,
they giue this rule, that euery song (which is not transposed) ending in G sol re vt, with the sharpe
in b fa b mi, is of the seuenth or eighth tune in f fa vt of the fifth or sixth tune, in elami of the thirde
or fourth tune, in dsolre is of the firste or second tune. And thus muche for the eight tunes, as they
be commonly taught. But Glareanus broke the yce for others to follow him into a further speculation &
perfect knowledge of these tunes or modi, and for the means to discern one from another of them, he saith
thus. The tunes or modi musici (which the Greeke writers cal 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , sometimes also 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  )
are distinguished no otherwise then the kinds of the diapason or eight from which they arise, are distinguished,
and other kindes of eightes are distinguished no otherwise then according to the place
of the halfe notes or semitonia conteined in them, as all the kindes of other consonants are distinguished.
For in the diatessaron there be foure sounds, and three distances (that is two whole notes & one lesse halfe
note) therefore there be three places where the halfe note may stand. For either it is in the middle place,
hauing a whole note vnder it, and another aboue it, and so produceth the first kind of diatessaron, as from
Are to dsolre, or then it standeth in the lowest place, hauing both the whole notes aboue it, producing the
second kind of diatessaron, as from ♮ mi to elami, or then is in the highest place, hauing both the whole
notes vnder it, in which case it produceth the third and last kind of diatessaron, as from c faut to effaut,
so that how many distances any consonant hath, so many kindes of that consonant there must be, bicause
the halfe note may stand in any of the places: and therefore diapente hauing fiue soundes and foure distances
(that is three whole notes and a halfe note) there must be foure kindes of diapente: the first from
dsolre to Alamire, the second from elami to bfabmi, the third from F faut to c solfaut, the fourth and laste,
from g solreut to dlasolre. If you proceed to make any more, the fift wil be the same with the first, hauing
the halfe note in the second place from below. Now the diapason conteining both the diapente & diatessaron,
as consisting of the coniunction of them together, it must follow that there be as many kinds of diapason
as of both the other, which is seuen. Therefore it is manifeste that our practicioners haue erred in
making eight tunes, separating the nature of the eight from that of the firste, seeing they haue both one
kinde of diapason, though diuided after another maner in the last then in the first. But if they wil separate
the eight from the first, because in the eight the fourth is lowest, which in the first was highest: then of
force must they diuide all the other sortes of the diapason, likewise after two maners, by which meanes,
there will arise fourteene kindes of formes, tunes, or modi, And to begin at the first kind of diapason (that

is from are to alamire) if you diuide it Arithmeticaly, that is, if you set the fourth lowest, & the fift highest,
then shall you haue the compasse of our second mood or tune, thogh it be the first with Boethius, & those
who wrote before him, and is called by them Hypodorius: also if you diuide the same kind of diapason harmonically,
that is, set the fift lowest, and the fourth highest, you shal haue the compasse of that tune which
the ancients had for their ninth, and was called aeolius, though the latter age woulde not acknowledge it
for one of the number of theirs. Thus you see that the first kind of the diapason produceth twoe tunes, according
to two forms, of mediation or diuision. But if you diuide the second kind of diap. Arithmetically,
you shal haue that tune which the latter age tearmed the fourth, and in the old time was the second called
hypophrygius: but if you diuide the same harmonically, setting the fift lowest, you shall haue a tune or
mood which of the ancients was iustly reiected: for if you ioine ♮ mi to F faut, you shal not make a ful fift
Also if you ioine F faut to b fa ♭ mi, you shall haue a tritonus, which is more by a great halfe note thē
a fourth. And because this diuision is false in the diatonicall kind of musicke (in which you may not make
a sharpe in F faut) this tune which was called hyperaeolius arising of it was reiected. If you diuide the third
kind of diap. from Cfaut to csolfaut Arithmetically, you shal haue the compasse and essential bounds of the
sixt tune, which the ancients named hypolydius: if you diuide it harmonically, you shal haue the ancient Ionicus
or Iastius, for both those names signifie one thing. If you diuide the fourth kind of diap. from D. to d
Arithmetically, it wil produce our eight tune, which is the ancient hyperiastius or hypomixolydius: if harmonically,
it is our first tune and the ancient dorius, so famous and recommended in the writinges of the
Philosophers. If the fift kind of diap. from Elami to elami, bee diuided arithmeticallie, it maketh a tune
which our age wil acknowledge for none of theirs, though it be our tenth indeed, and the ancient hypoaeolius,
but if it be harmonically diuided, it maketh our third tune, and the olde phrygius. But if the sixt kind
of the diap. be diuided arithmetically, it will produce a reiected mood, because from Ffaut to b fa ♭ mi, is a
tritonus, which distance is not receiued in the diatonical kind, and as for the flat in b fa ♮ b mi, it was not
admitted in diatonicall musicke, no more then the sharpe in F faut, which is a moste certain argument
that this musicke which we now vse, is not the true diatonicum, nor any species of it. But againe to our deuision
of the eights. If the sixt kind be diuided harmonicallye, it is our fift tune and the auncient lydius.
Lastly, if you diuide the seuenth kind of diap. (which is from G to g) arithmetically, it wil make the ancient
hypoionicus or hypoiastius (for both those are one) but if you diuide it harmonically, it wil make our seauenth
tune, and the ancient mixolydius. Thus you see that euery kind of diap. produceth two seueral tunes
or moods, except the second & sixt kinds, which make but one a peece, so that now there must be twelue
and not only eight. Now for the vse of them (specially in tenors and plainsongs, wherein their nature is
best perceiued) it is to be vnderstood, that they be vsed either simply by themselues, or ioyned with others,
and by themfelues sometimes they fill all their compasse, somtimes they do not fill it, and somtime
they exceed it. And in the odde or autenticall tunes, the church musicke doth often goe a whole note vnder
the finall or lowest key, and that most commonly in the first and seuenth tunes: in the third it cōmeth
sometimes two whole notes vnder the finall key, and in the fift bnt a halfe note. But by the contrary in plagall
tunes, they take a note aboue the highest key of the fift (which is the highest of the plagal) as in the
sixt and eight, in the second and fourth, they take bnt halfe a note, though sildome in the second, & more
commonly in the fourth. But if any song do exceed the compasse of a tune, then bee there two tunes ioyned
together, which may be thus: the first and second, the third and fourth, &c. an autentical still beeing
ioyned with a plagal, but two plagals or two autenticals ioyned togither, is a thing against nature. It is also
to be vnderstood that those examples which I haue in my booke set downe for the eight tunes, bee not
the true and essentiall formes of the eight tunes or vsuall moodes, but the formes of giuing the tunes to
their psalmes in the Churches, which the churchmen (falsly) beleeue to be the modi or tunes, but if we consider
them rightly, they be all of some vnperfect mood, none of them filling the true compas of any mood
And thus much for the twelue tunes, which if any man desire to know more at large, let him read the 2 &
third bookes of Glareanus his dodecachordon, the fourth booke of Zaccone his practise of musicke, and the
fourth part of Zarlino his harmonicall institutions, where hee may satisfie his desire at full, for with the
helpe of this which here is set downe, he may vnderstand easily all which is there handled, though some
haue causelesse complained of obscuritie. Seeing therefore further discourse wil be superfluous, I wil heere
make an ende.
