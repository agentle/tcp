            To the Right
Honourable, FRANCIS,
Counteſſe of
Hertford (Daughter to
the Right Honourable,
Thomas, Vicount Bindon)
Antony Stafford, wiſhes
the effects of her
wiſhes.
            VVHat I had a
long time
ſought for in

others (excellent Lady)
and could neuer
find, of my ſelfe, at
laſt I found in you. I
meane, Madame, a
true definitiō of Honor:
Which, as I firſt
found in you; ſo at
laſt I honoured you
for it, and will do to
my laſt. And ſhould
I not, I were as worthleſſe
as you are worthy;
ſith I neuer in any,
but in you, diſcover'd
the height of
Blood, of Beauty, of

Vertue, of Spirit, and
(which vvonder at
World, or thou thy
ſelfe wilt be wondred
at) with all theſe, the
height of lowe Humility:
Of Humility,
Madame, in you to
bee admired; not to
be imitated: or if to
bee imitated, not to
be equalled. I know,
your Ladiſhippe (in
whom Mildneſs and
Modeſtie haue made
a Mariage) will rather
mislike than admit

theſe prayſes.
Pardon me, Madam;
you ſhould not doe
ſo. For, as Vertue
cānot be ouerpriz'd;
no more can ſhe euer
be ouer-prais'd.
            Were it not the
world would thinke
that Partialitie did
prompt mee, I would
yet ad to yor praiſes;
not that you might
reade them; but
that after Ages, by
them, might knowe
howe faire was the

fairer part of faireſt
you; and knowing
it, admire it; & with
admiration, imitate
it. It would be long
(incōparable Ladie)
it wold be very long,
before wee ſhold win
any one to belong to
Vertue, vvith the
meer prayſing her in
abſtract, ſhould vve
not praiſe her in ſom
perſon gracious in
Gods eye, and the
Worlds.
            I know, Madame, I

ſhall bee prays'd for
praiſing you; & diſprays'd
for offring to
expreſſe the infinite
honour and ſeruice
I owe you, vvith ſo
poore a preſent, ſo
little a labour, as this
vnlicked Work. The
truth is, Madam, that
finding my Booke to
haue little ſpirit, or
life in it, I made vſe of
your Name to make
it liue. For, it could
not liue long, without
your euer-liuing

vertues to relieue it.
I am ſo farre from
expecting thanks; as
that I humbly craue
pardon, for preſuming
ſo much to abuſe
your Name, as
to ſette it before ſo
weake a Worke. If I
liue, moſt woorthy
Lady, I heer promiſe
you and the Age, a
farre greater, and a
farre better. If in the
meane time I die, I
die infinitely indebted.
Thus, with my

vnceſſant prayers for
your Ladiſhip, and
your thrice honorable
Lord, I reſt
            
               Your Honors humble,
loyall Servant, and
vnwoorthy kinſman,
Antony Stafford.
            
         
         
            
            TO THE
Vnderſtander.
            VNderstander (for,
to euery Reader I
write not) beholde
this Booke with a gentle
eye, and entertaine it with
fauour. It was penn'd by
him who had rather ſay,
Eſt iudicium in nobis,
than eſt furor in nobis.
Winke therefore at the
want of witte thou ſhalt
finde; ſince it is a worke

of iudgement onely. As
for the Aſſes of the Age,
I care as little for their
cenſures, as their companies.
Though they can pick
out good ſenſe, yet they
will not; contrarie to the
equity of a Reader; who,
in a place doubtful, ſhould
ſtriue to vnderſtand, before
he cry out, Non ſenſe.
They little knovve, that
hee, who writes in euery
thing properly, ſhall neuer
vvrite anie thing pleaſingly.
If I were diſpoſed
to carpe, I doe not thinke
there are ten lines in any
booke extant, out of which
I would not pick ſomthing

to cauill at. My greatest
comfort is, I neuer yet
ſaw any carper that had
any iudgement. VVhich
vvhoſoeuer wants, lacks
the very ſalt of wit: without
which, whatſoeuer is
read, lies ravve, and vndigeſted.
But, that which
makes mee moſt merrie,
is, that ſome of our printed
puppies thinke themſelues
worthy to bee compared
vvith the moſt authenticke,
auncient Authours;
vvhoſe vvittes
they come as ſhort of, as
of their vvorkes. I haue
heard ſome of them cenſure
Authours, vvhome

they doe as little vnderſtand,
as they doe themſelues.
If they had but
ſome ſmall deale of matter
vvith their manie
vvordes, they might (I
confeſſe) rubbe-out reaſonably
vvell, amongst
coxcombes, that are capable
of no higher matters
than themſelues. But,
as they are, I vvould intreate
them to content
themſelues vvith their
Iigge-learning: in which
when they haue knowne
all they can, they then
knowe iust nothing; and,
as Seneca ſaith, operosè
nihil agunt. I write

not this out of Spleene,
for the wrong they haue
done mee: for, my ſpirite
is pearcht ſo farre aboue
them, that they cannot
fling ſo high, as to
hit it. Doe not I knowe,
that theſe Times let-looſe
literatores, to ſet vpon
literatiores? Yes, yes: I
knowe it; and haue puton
a reſolution to beare
both vvith the iniquity,
and the ſtoliditie of the
Times. Farewell, Vnderstander,
and
vſe mee
wel.

            MEDITATIONS
MORAL, DIVINE,
POLITICALL.
(*⁎*)
         
            
               WHen I conſider
in what eſtate
Man was created,
I cannot but thinke
of his folly; who, through
a falſe hope of knowing
good and euill, loſt the enough
of good hee had,
and found too much euil.
This makes mee call to

minde the vaine ambition
of thoſe, who
ſeeke to prie into that
vnreuealed (and therefore
inſcrutable) knowledge
of the Deity: vppon
whom GOD looking
down, ſaies in a pitifull
deriſion (as hee did
to Adam) Beholde, the
men are become as one
of vs. This meditation
ſtretcheth-out it ſelfe,
and biddes mee alſo conſider
the arrogancie of
thoſe, who ſcorne to
erre, or to bee reprehended
for their errours,
not-withſtanding that
they ſee Man to haue erred

in the ſtate of Innocencie.
I will therefore
ſeeke to knowe my ſelfe
(the next and ſureſt way
to knowe GOD) and
by an humble Confeſſion,
begge Remiſsion
of my faults. I ſay, I will
confeſſe them vnto God;
not boaſt of them to
Man.
         
         
            2
            When I thinke who
made me, and wherfore
hee made me, I hold my
ſelfe a glorious creature:
when I conſider of what
hee made mee, I then
thinke my ſelfe corruptible
and miſerable. I will

therefore temper the former
with the later: ſo ſhal
I neuer grow too proud,
nor too abiect.
         
         
            3
            When I behold Beauty,
it puts me in minde of
my Glorification: but
withall, I find, that it hindereth
much my Mortification.
I will therefore,
as neere as I can, neuer
fix mine eye vpon Beauty;
leaſt by being neuer
mortified, I neuer be glorified.
         
         
            4
            When a man is borne,
hee beginnes to die: but
when the iuſt man dies,

hee then but beginnes to
liue. I will therefore in
my beginning thinke of
my end; that in my end, I
may reioyce in my better
and neuer-ending beginning.
         
         
            5
            
               Iob made a couenant
with his eyes, leaſt at any
time they ſhould looke
vpon a Mayde: but, ſince
I cannot make a couenant
with mine eyes, leaſt
at any time they look vppon
a Maide, I will trie if
I can make a couenant
with my heart, leaſt at any
time it deſire a Maide.
         
         
            
            6
            GOD made Heauen
for the good, Hell
for the badde: but, he
made earth for both.
This ſhewes vs, that
while wee liue heere,
wee muſt of neceſsity
conuerſe with both. I
will therefore lay mine
eares open to all; but,
my heart to few.
         
         
            7
            Our Maſter hath
left vs two Sacraments.
One of which tell's vs
that wee are Chriſtians:

the other biddes vs liue
like Chriſtians. This
later is that Tree of
Life; the paſſage whereto
is guarded by no
Cherubin, nor by any
brandiſhed Sword: but
whoſoeuer will, may
come thither; and, eating
worthily, may liue
for euer. VVhen therefore
I eate of this Tree,
I will remember out of
whoſe bloud it ſprang.
The memory whereof
will ſuggeſt vnto mee,
that if I eate not this
fruit worthily, I am vnworthy
to be a branch of
the Tree: that is, if I eate

not his body worthily, I
am then vnworthy to be
a member of that body
whereof he is the head.
         
         
            8
            The firſt murtherer of
all mankinde, was alſo
the firſt Lyer; two horrible
vices, and alike
bloudy. For, a man had
better bee murthered,
then belyed; haue his
perſon ſlaine, then his
fame. I will therefore flie
from a Lyer, as from an
Aſpe: the poyſon of
whoſe tongue is mortall.
         
         
            9
            Beſides our internall,

originall, and actuall
ſinnes, wee haue externall
& accidentall crimes
layed vpon vs by our families;
but, in my conceit,
very vniuſtly: for,
wee haue enough to anſwere
for the firſt man;
and are no way liable to
the debts of his ſucceſſors.
VVhy ſhould man
lay more vpon man, than
GOD himſelfe doth?
As with him the vertues
of my Houſe cannot ſaue
me, no more can the
vices of it damne mee.
The Law of God ſhall be
with me, aboue the Law
of Armes, or the Law

of Nations.
         
         
            10
            Thoſe that ſerue God
only vpon Sundayes, are
like ſeruants extraordinarie;
who come to waite
vpon their great Lords,
onely vpon great dayes:
But I will make euery
day my Sabbath; and
will follow my Lord in
ordinary, making Charitie
my Cognizance.
         
         
            11
            VVhile the Papiſts
and wee contend which
of vs erre moſt in matters
of faith, wee ſtriue
who ſhall erre moſt in

matters of life: ſo that
wee ſtudie at once,
who ſhall beleeue beſt,
and who ſhall liue worſt;
not who ſhall bee moſt
vertuous, but who moſt
enuious. My chiefeſt
care therefore ſhall bee,
to liue well: ſo ſhall I
euer bee ſure to fare
better, than hee who
beleeues well, and liues
ill.
         
         
            12
            Two ſortes of men
I loathe, and deteſt; a
Foole, and a Carper.
Yet, of the two, I
would make choyce to
holde diſcourſe with the

Carper: for, I had rather
be miſunderſtood in all,
then not to bee vnderſtood
at all. I will therefore
onely beware of the
one: but I will ſcorne the
other.
         
         
            13
            Laughing is onely proper
to man, amongſt all
liuing creatures: whereas
indeede he ought euer
to be weeping, in that he
euer ſinnes; & the beaſts
euer laughing, to ſee man
ſo much abuſe his ſo
much reaſon. O! if a
man knew before hee
came into the world,
what hee ſhould endure

in the world, hee would
feare his firſt day, more
than his laſt. I will therfore
weepe at mine owne
miſery, and neuer laugh
but at mine owne folly:
and ſince my Maſter was
Vir dolorum, a man of
griefes, it ſhall not be ſaid
that I am Vir voluptatum,
a man of mirth.
            
         
         
            14
            
               Valour hath many ſervants
going vnder her
name: but few of them
are her true fauorites.
Some ſnatch courage
from her; and, wanting
wiſedome to rule it, are
diſclaimed by her. Others

are Giants in their
wordes, and Dwarfes in
their deedes. She hates
him, who ſpeakes more
than he dares doe; and
makes him her Champion,
who dares do more
than he dare ſpeake. I, I:
hee is the man with her,
who wounds his enemy
with his ſword; not with
his word. Yet, Chriſtianity
vnhorſes euen Valour
her ſelfe; and, depoſing
her, makes new lawes,
and proclaimes him the
braueſt combatant, who
can conquer himſelfe:
that is, who can aſcend
ſo high aboue Nature,

as to deſcend belowe
himſelfe, and to offer
ſeruice where hee owes
reuenge. I will inuoke
GOD to endue mee
with this ſupernaturall
gift; and, withall, to deliuer
mee from a valiant
drunkard, and a valiant
foole.
         
         
            15
            VVhen my memory
lookes back, as far as ſhe
can ſee, me thinks it is but
yeſterday: & yet I know,
by courſe of Nature, my
life cannot bee trebbl'd.
Now, I haue indured ſo
much miſery in my one
Yeſterday, that I am affraide

to thinke of the
two To-morrowes.
         
         
            16
            It is a woonder, to ſee
the childiſh whining we
now-adayes vſe at the funeralls
of our friends. If
we could houl them back
againe, our lamentations
were to ſome purpoſe:
but as they are, they are
vaine, and in vain. If therfore
my friend be good, I
will be glad that he is rid
of the world: if hee bee
bad, I will not bee ſorry
that the world is rid of
him: but, that ſo wofull a
world is like to receiue
him. If I haue a friend,

whoſe ſoule ioyn'd with
mine, makes but one
minde; and that at his
death, I ſee, my teares
muſt burſt out, or my
heart within; I may then
perhaps yeeld to the infirmity
of the fleſh: yet not
ſo much, that he hath left
the world, as that he hath
left mee in it.
         
         
            17
            He is the moſt miſerable
of men, who faſhions
his body and minde according
to the opinion
of the vulgar; and he the
happieſt, who conforms
his life to the lawes of a
true iudgement. This

mā knows, that we muſt
heare with many, but decree
with few, & ioyning
forces with two or three
braue retired ſpirits, hee
bandies with a legion of
the Vulgar. Hee lookes
downe with pitie on the
poore Plebeians; & (like
Xerxes) bewailes their
hard hap, in that none of
their names ſhal liue after
a few yeares. Knowing
that the eternall ſubſtance
of his ſoule was
breath'd into him, by the
Eternall, he cares for nothing
which is not able to
hold-out with Eternity.
I will therefore deſpiſe

things momentary: and
ſince I haue ful aſſurance,
that I ſhall liue in the other
world, my deedes
ſhal do their beſt to make
me liue in this.
         
         
            18
            Now-a-dayes the clothes
are ſpoken to, and
not the men: and few
haue regard to the riches
of the breaſt; but, of the
backe. He, who in his faſhions
differs, and degenerates
moſt from his
anceſtours, is held the
moſt generous Gentlemā.
The world is grown
ſo ſenſuall, that the parts
of the body are preferr'd

before thoſe of the mind;
ſo that to ſay, He is a man
of good parts, is as much
to ſay, as He is a man of
good members. Chriſt
ſayes that the body is
more worth then the raiment:
but ſome of our
Gallants make them
clothes more worth then
their bodies. With me it
ſhall not be a good argument,
to ſay, I will weare
this, becauſe it becomes
me; but, I will weare this,
becauſe it becomes a
man: and he that ſpeakes
to my clothes, and not to
me, ſhall bee anſwered
by my clothes, and not
by me.
         
         
            
            19
            Some are neuer well,
but when they are vnpacking
their boſomes
with wordes, and whiſpering
their thoughts in
the eares of their reputed
friends: & at length, thorough
the perfidiouſnes
of ſom falſ brother, they
are brought either to die
ſhamefull deaths, or to
liue the like liues. If therfore
I find my tongue to
be ſo laxatiue, as that it
cannot holde, but muſt
needes bewray me, I will
locke my ſecrets deepe in
my hart: & if my tongue
vnlocke my heart, I will

bite it, and beate my
heart for not tying my
tongue. I will not doe
GOD ſo great a diſhonour,
as to demy-deifie
Man, in making him
priuy to my heart and
thoughts.
         
         
            20
            Nothing giues vs delight
in this world, but
Beauty. We take pleaſure
in beholding heauē when
it is faire, and cleere: but
when it is ouer-caſt, our
minds are clouded, and
our bodies ill diſpoſed.
Wee loue Veſta better,
when her face is ſmooth,
and her colours freſh,

than when her beauty is
blaſted, and her viſage
wrinkled. For, in Summer
euery man lies, with,
& vpon his firſt mother,
nuzzles himſelfe in her
lap, and playes with her
dainties; whereas in the
Winter euery mā keeps
his houſe: and yet if that
be not neate and ſweete,
we loath that too. One
and the ſamething, being
young, delights; beeing
old, diſpleaſes. I wil therfore
ioy in nothing, more
thā in Beauty; nor admire
any thing, more than
her: yet ſince ſhe is ſuch
an Inchantreſſe, my bodily

eye ſhall neuer beholde
her, but withall my ſpirituall
eye ſhal be fixt vpon
hir Maker; who made
her to feede the ſenſe, not
to bewitch the ſoule:
who left her vs, to make
vs conceiue how much
more excellent is that inconceiueable
fairneſs of
the celeſtiall Canaan. In a
word; ſhee is but a corruptible
type of an incorruptible
treaſure. And as
Chriſt ſhal conſume Antichriſt
with the brightnes
of his glory: ſo ſhall
the blaſing beauty of the
other world, blaſt the fading
fairneſs of this.
         
         
            
            21
            More then many there
are, to whom Superſtition
dictates, that it is pleaſing
to GOD to weare
ſqualid, and vncleane clothes;
and that the wellfare
of the ſoule conſiſts
in the foule keeping of
the bodie. Others there
are, whom Hypocriſie
leades the ſame way.
They both erre: the former,
by not knowing the
Scriptures; the later, by
tranſgreſsing againſt thē:
for, Chriſt commands vs
not to looke ſoure, as the
Hypocrites, who disfigure
their faces, that they

may ſeeme vnto men to
faſt. I will therefore waſh
my handes, and face, and
anoint my head; that my
head my bee anoynted
with the oyle of gladnes.
And ſince I cannot endure
to ſee the lodging
of my body durty, I will
much more haue a care,
to keepe the chamber of
my ſoule cleane. When
my ſoule is ſadde, my
countenance ſhal be merrie:
neither wil I ſo much
care to caſt vp mine eyes
to heauen, as to lift vp
my heart to God; not ſo
much reſpecting the
throne, as the inthron'd.
         
         
            
            22
            Many there are, who
neuer ſerue God, but whē
hee ſerues their turne.
Hence it comes to paſſe,
that the Sea-man mutters
againſt him, when he
hath not a good winde;
& the Plough-mā, when
he hath badde weather.
All this proceedes from
nothing, but the imprudency
of man; which accuſeth
the Prouidence of
God, of Improuidency.
Before there was any
raine at al, what did God
then? Did hee not ſend a
miſt vp from the earth,
which watered all the

earth? Hee will not haue
his power tied to any ordinary
meane; but, will
ſhew vs what hee is, by
what he can doe. When
therefore mine owne
meanes faile me, I will relie
vpon God: who is as
able to giue mee ſomething,
as to make me of
nothing; to keepe me to
the laſt, as to make me at
the firſt.
         
         
            23
            He that ſtriues to pleaſe
the intoxicated multitude,
labours as much in
vaine, as he that ſought to
put the winds in a bagge.
And the reaſon is, becauſe

it is impoſsible to pleaſe
the godly and vngodly,
the judicial and the vnjudiciall,
the ſenſible & the
ſenſeleſſe, both at once.
Neyther Chriſt, nor his
fore-runner could pleaſe
them. For, Iohn came
neyther eating nor drinking;
and they ſaid, He
had a diuell. The Sonne
of Man came eating and
drinking; and they ſaid,
Behold a glutton, and a
drinker of wine, a friend
to Publicans and ſinners.
I will therefore take my
Sauiours counſel, & ſeeke
to iuſtifie my iudgement
to the children of VViſedome,

of whom ſhe is iuſtified;
and not to fooles,
by whom ſhee is daily
crucified.
         
         
            24
            As many haue hungry
ſtomackes; but, few diſgeſting:
ſo many haue
apprehending wits; but,
few iudging. Hence it
comes to paſſe, that ſome
are wiſe in words, & fools
in actions. For my part,
I had rather it ſhould be
ſaid, that I am one of the
iudgements of the town,
then that I am one of the
wits of the towne.
         
         
            25
            Diuers men propound

vnto themſelues diuers
ends. One makes honor
his end; another, riches:
a third hunts after both:
a fourth ſeeks to purchaſe
to himſelfe the name and
fame of a Schollar; a fift,
of a Souldier, &c. As for
me, I wil make the honor
of God mine end. So ſhall
I be ſure that mine end
ſhall not be diſhonourable.
         
         
            26
            I haue often wonder'd
with my ſelfe, to thinke
that Schollars are the
moſt poore of all others;
notwithſtanding that they
haue the beſt wits of all

others. And my wonder
neuer left mee, till I
conſidered, that they
car'd not for the things
of this world, which the
Mothe & Canker could
corrupt; but, laid vp their
treaſures in the other
world: whereas they,
who knew nothing, but
the things of this world,
carkt and car'd moſt for
the world. Some ſay,
that becauſe Salomon vs'd
the riches hee had ſo ill,
therfore God would neuer
ſince bleſſe Schollars
with them: But, that is
falſe: for, wee ſee Kings
Philoſophers, and Diuines.

I wil beſeech God,
to giue mee an eſtate equally
diſtant from abundance,
and penury.
So ſhall I neuer riſe ſo
high as preſumption, nor
fall ſo low as deſpaire:
yet of the two, I had rather
haue nothing than
know nothing; that my
body ſhould want, than
my ſoule.
         
         
            27
            The Hermits are reprehended,
for ſequeſtring
themſelues from
the world: and it is the
opinion of many reuerend
Diuines, that hee is
moſt valiant, who grapples

with the enemy; that
is, who talkes face to face
with the wicked. Yet too
much relying vpon this
Maxime, hath brought
many into the iawes of
danger; but, hath fetcht
few out. To be a good
man in the middeſt of
Sodome, to bee abſtemious
in Germany, to bee
chaſte in Italy, all theſe
are hard and rare things;
we ſeeing many returne
abſolutely vitious from
thence, that almoſt went
abſolutely vertuous thither.
True it is, that
Chriſt kept company
with Publicans: but, as

true it is, that hee was
without the leauell of
temptation. We ſee one
man change nature with
another, and put on the
diſpoſition of him, with
whom hee conuerſes. I
will therefore not onely
ſhun euil, but the meanes
to come to it; & to auoid
hurt, I will keepe my ſelfe
out of ſhot: neyther will
I preſume, being but a
man, to follow my Maſter
in that which he did
as God.
         
         
            28
            Man conſiſts of two
parts; the body and the
minde: that is, ſaith Lactantius,
               
of heauen and
earth. I will therfore not
grudge to let my earth
go to earth; that my heauen
may go to heauen.
         
         
            29
            The greateſt and moſt
common care men haue,
is, to paſſe away the time.
They deſire moſt to
paſſe away that, which is
moſt pretious. O! if they
knew what treaſure
Time offers to their
ſoules, they would looke
with a iealous eye vpon
the houre-glaſſe, and ſigh
at the dropping of euery
ſand. They abuſe & loſe
Time, the mother of Experience;

and ſo, loſe Experience,
the Mother of
Wiſedome. It is a hard
caſe, when a dying man
ſhall think with himſelfe,
that he hath left nothing
behind him, wherby poſterity
may knowe, hee
did once liue. If that this
man (ſaith Seneca) inhabit
this world a thouſand
yeeres, yet can wee not
truly ſay, Hic vir diu vixit,
This man liu'd long;
but, Hic vir diu fuit, This
man was long. For my
part, I had rather the cō
               pany
would paſſe away,
then the time; except it
be ſuch company, as may

helpe mee to redeeme the
time. And while I liue
heere, I will ſtudie ſo to
vſe Time, as that I may
come to liue there, where
is no time.
            
         
         
            30
            In theſe times, when
mē wil lay an imputation
vpō one, they will ſay, He
is Morally honeſt. Certain
it is, that hee, who is at
no time morally honeſt,
can neuer be religiouſlie
good. God ſhewes that
hee is our Father by his
works, in, and for vs: &
we ſhould ſhewe, that we
are his children by our
works, to his, & for him.

It is not enough, to ſay
with the thiefe, Lord, remember
mee, when thou
cōmeſt into thy kingdome,
vnleſſe wee remēber him
here. To belieue Chriſt,
is not enough; neither is
it enough to beleeue in
him: for, wee ought as
well belieue in his commaundements,
that wee
muſt doe them; as in his
promiſes, that wee ſhall
haue them. Wee reade,
that wee ſhould declare
our faith by our workes;
that is, our inviſible belief
by our viſible life: but, we
no where read, that wee
ſhould ſhewe our workes

by our faith. True it is,
that the Scripture bids
vs, not to giue almes ſonante
tuba, vvith our
tongues talking of that
wee giue; but, with our
harts thinking for whom
we giue. No, no: he that
glories in his works, ſhall
neuer bee glorified for
thē. The Publican could
not haue done a work ſo
acceptable in the ſight of
Chriſt, as was the diſclaiming
his owne workes.
For, as we haue nothing,
but from God: ſo God
will haue vs confeſſe, that
we can do nothing without
him. I wil haue mercie

on my neighbor, that
God may haue mercy on
mee; and ſaue him from
momentarie miſery, that
I may be ſaued frō eternall.
Yet, in ſo doing, will
I knowe what I doe; &
wil tell, that I doe it for
the diſcharge of my duty,
and to Gods glory;
who hath promiſed to
make mee a great one in
heauen, if I relieue but
one of his little ones on
earth.
         
         
            31
            Wee reade, that Alphonſus,
and Fridericus,
Kings of Spaine and Sicily,
recouered their long

loſt health (being giuenouer
by the Phyſicians)
by reading hiſtorie: Alphonſus
by reading T. Liuius;
and Fridericus by
reading Q. Curtius. Two
Chriſtian Kings were
healed by profane hiſtorie.
O! if vaine, and vncertaine
Annales haue
ſuch a miraculous operation:
what haue thoſe ſacred
pages, penned by
the hands of Prophets,
and Apoſtles; & wherin
the Spirit of GOD hath
expreſſed the maieſtie of
God? All you that are
ſick, come you hither; &
read heere, where Comfort

her ſelfe offers to
cure you. Come hither
Lambes, and you may
wade: come hither Elephants,
& you may ſwim.
Come hither Children,
and feed on milke: come
hither you tooth'd vnderſtandings,
& you ſhal
feed on hard meat. Lord
let mine eyes loſe their
light, in beholding this
light: and let mee reade
that till I die, which can
make mee liue, neuer to
die.
         
         
            32
            Nothing torments a
man more then ambition.
She is the only enemy

to Content, and Rebel againſt
Reaſon. Shee is
borne with her eyes caſt
vp; that is, comparing
her ſelfe with thoſe, that
are aboue her. If ſhee
caſt her eyes downe, it is
but in ſcorne of thoſe
that are belovve her. If
ſhee ſhould bee pearcht
vpon the verie toppe of
heauen, yet ſhee vvould
deſire to clime higher.
That I may not bee ſubiect
to this aſpyring diuell,
I will be contrary to
her; and neuer compare
my ſelfe, but with my Inferiours.
And if I ſee no
man more contemptible

than my ſelfe, I vvill yet
retaine the maieſtie of a
Man; and thinke that I
am placed Lord, and
King, ouer the Beaſts.
         
         
            33
            There is nothing durable
in this vvorld, but
grief. As for the word reioyce,
it requires, in moſt
toongs, an Ablatiue Caſe;
and is taken away before
it be throughly enioyed.
Griefe is a firme and neuer-flitting
companiō of
Man: and it neuer forſakes
him; though all
his friends do. The firſt
note man ſings, is howling;
and his laſt, groning.

I will therefore moralize
vpon this, and think that
the all-griefe wee haue in
this world, is but a figure
of that all-ioy we ſhall inioy
in the next world; &
as a ſowre Preparatiue,
to make vs reliſh that
ſweet food the better.
         
         
            34
            Friends are threefold;
profitable, delightful, vertuous.
The two former
are imbraced in this
world; the later ca
                  •
               sierd.
The name of an honeſt
man is growne odious:
and the reputation to be
ſuch a one, is a clogge to a
mans riſing. And therefore

as one ſaies, That he
had rather be rich, than
be accoūted ſo: ſo a man
had better be honeſt, thā
be reputed ſo. In theſe
gayiſh times, the outward
appearance is more
looked into, th
                  •
               n the inward
eſſence 
                  〈◊〉
                that of
Seneca is 
                  〈…〉
               
               Annulis
magi
                     ••
                   quam animis
creditur. For my part, I
will not make choice of a
friend, that hath not all
thoſe three accidents vnited
in him; to wit, profit,
pleaſure, and vertue.
But of what profeſsion
ſhall this my friend bee?
A knowing, doing ſcholar.

Hee is the true profitable
friend, the onely delightfull,
the moſt trulie
vertuous. That he is profitable,
appeares in this,
that in exchanging vvith
him a demand for an anſwere,
a man ſhall gaine a
ſecret, worth a Signiory.
That he is delightfull, no
man will deny, that hath
his vnderſtanding but
once tickled with his diſcourſe.
That hee is the
trulieſt vertuous, is eaſily
prooued; in that other
men are in loue with vertue
onely by relation:
wheras the Scholar, with
his vnderſtanding part,

pries into her faireſt
partes, and loues her for
her ſelfe onely, without
any other baſe reſpect.
A Merchant loueth a
Merchant; as hoping to
gaine by him. A Souldier
loueth a Souldier; as
expecting to be reſcued
by him: but, a Schollar
loueth a Schollar; as deſiring
to be better inſtructed
by him. I, I: this is
loue indeed; and this is a
friend indeed: & he that
loues not ſuch a friend,
hates himſelfe.
         
         
            35
            It is a thing worthy
obſeruation, how the

vulgar feedes vpon falſe
opinions. For example;
if a man ſeduce a woman
to commit what ſhould
be omitted, he is little or
nothing defam'd therby,
but ſhee: the ſeducer is
not ſo much blam'd, as
the ſeduced. If a child
conſent with a man to
cōmit a villany, I would
faine know, whether the
child, or the man deſerue
the ſharper cenſure. If the
ſtronger veſſell ouerturn
the weaker, which of thē
cauſeth the fall? Some
obiect, that a woman
ſhould haue more modeſtie
than a man; & therefore

is held more culpable
in the breach thereof.
That a woman ſhould
be more ſhamefac't than
a man, I grant; that more
ſhame-minded, I denie. A
man ſhould not haue a

                  •
               earefull bluſh: but, hee
ſhould euer retaine an
honeſt ſhame. And yet,
whoſoeuer ſhould maintaine
(againſt all Ethicks)
that modeſtie is cōmon
(though not alike common)
to euery age, and
ſex, he ſhould on his ſide
haue probabilitie: out of
which, abſurditie neuer
yet iſſued. I haue ſeene a
fellow bluſh, whoſe face

Age had pleighted, and
whoſe eyes could neither
ſend out light, nor receiue
it in. And indeed, it
is a thing common to euery
man, to bluſh for
error in manners, though
not in life. Some will anſwere,
There are men,
whom nothing can make
bluſh. To whom I reply,
that I doubt not, but
there are both men and
women, whom Impudencie
her ſelfe hath trained
vp; and, ſitting on
their faces, beats-backe
the bluſhing bloud. Amongſt
all the vulgar errors,
that of extenuating

mans offence is the groſſeſt:
and I would I could
with reaſon murther this
opinion. Howſoeuer; if
I cannot beat the vulgar
from it, yet I will be ſure
the vulgar ſhal neuer beat
it into mee.
         
         
            36
            It is an Aphoriſme in
Phyſick, that we conſiſt
of thoſe things by which
wee are nouriſht: So alſo
falls it out with the ſoule.
For, if ſhe feed vpō groſs

                  •
               nd vncleane converſation,
ſhee proues impure:
if the converſation bee
choice and good, ſhee
growes faire and louelie.

Howſoeuer my bodie
fare, I will be careful that
my ſoule ſucke her ſuſtenance
out of vvhat is
ſweet and good: if it bee
otherwiſe, ſhee ſhall not
once chew it; much leſſe
digeſt it.
         
         
            37
            As at ſom times, meats;
ſo at ſom times, diſcourſes
are out of ſeaſon. To
diſcourſe in matters of
policie, or of controuerſie,
in the preſence of women,
is altogether as
much out of ſeaſon, as
Oiſters in Iuly. Let me
therefore conſider how,
vvhen, and to whom I

ſpeak: and if I can ſpeak
to no purpoſe, I will (if I
can) hold my tongue to
ſome purpoſe.
         
         
            38
            There is no ſuch laughing-ſtock
in the world, as
the worldling: Hee ſaith
in his heart, There is no
God; and liues therafter:
& on the other ſide, God
ſaith, hee is not his child;
and therefore giues him
ouer to his luſts, and permits
him ſo to liue. Hee
thinkes the ioy to come
vncertaine; and therfore
prefers a preſent certaine
ſorrow before it; beeing
afraid to let his body put

off his infirmities. Lord
take me thither, where I
ſhall not conceiue the
griefe I doe heere: by taking
mee from hence;
where I cannot conceiue
the ioy, I ſhal haue there.
         
         
            39
            I cannot but laugh at
the vaine wiſhes of men.
One vviſhes that hee
might neuer want mony;
another, that he might euer
enioy health; a third,
that hee might neuer die.
Not one of my deſires
ſhall fight againſt neceſsitie:
but, I wil rather wiſh
for that which muſt bee,
than wiſh, that that

may not bee, which muſt
bee.
         
         
            40
            All opinions are not to
be told; but onely ſuch,
as either learned men, or
elſe the Church of God
haue held before vs. To
leaue antiquitie, & cleaue
to our own opinions, argues
a ſelfe-opinion, and
no wiſedom. Some there
are, who care not hovv
raw their opinions be, ſo
they be rare. I for my
part, had rather wander
with cōpany, than alone;
make another mans iudgment
my ground, than
ground my ſelfe vpon

mine owne iudgement:
for I had rather that my
Author ſhould be laughed
at, than my ſelfe.
         
         
            41
            Amongſt the diuerſe
complaints of men, there
is none ſo ordinarie, as
that of Age: but, eſpecially
womē are vext with
this old vnwelcom gueſt;
& had rather ceaſe to be,
than ceaſe to be young.
Hee that tells a woman,
ſhee hath a wrinkle in
her face, giues her a woūd
in the hart. If her complexion
faile neuer ſo little,
her ſpirit falls with it.
Shee feares not Death awhit,

but his ordinarie
forerunner, Age. Many
men alſo become vvomaniſh;
& haue hermaphroditicall
minds. If a
verdit of vvomen once
pronounce them ill-fauor'd,
they ſtreight ſequeſter
themſelues from
the world; as, vnworthy
of the world. I care not if
my corruptible part rot,
ſo my fairer part fade
not: nor paſſe I ſo much
for the beautie of the
Caſe, as for the glorious
ſplendour of the incloſed
Image.
         
         
            42
            Many trauell: but, few

deſerue to be ſtiled Trauellers.
To fetch-home
apiſh geſtures, queint faſhions,
new vices, is now
becom the propoſed end
of a Traueller. There is
no better ſport, than to
read ſome of their written
Obſeruations. One
ſets downe, what delicate
Wines, and Salats haue
been ſubiect to the command
of his palate. Another
diſcouers ſtrange
ſtratagems in a gun-hole.
A third, writes out all
ſuperſcriptions of Hoſpitals,
&c. Phy vpon it;
that a man ſhould goe
from home, to goe from

himſelfe, and returne deſtitute
of the little wit he
caried out with him. The
wiſeſt of Grecians eſteemed
him wiſe, who had
ſeene many Cities, and
the diuers manners of
men. Euery Carrier can
ſee many Citties, & the
different natures of Nations:
but, to diſcern betwixt
them, & pick wiſdome
out of them, that
requires the man; and
ſuch a man did Homer require.
The reaſon why
wee trauell, is, becauſe
all happy wits raigne not
vnder one Climate; and
therfore are to be hunted

out. Who would not
wade a million of miles,
to enterchange diſcourſe
with a Scaliger, a Lipſius,
or a Cauſabone? My
mind therefore ſhall trauel
more than my body;
when the later reſts, the
former ſhall labour: and
my care ſhal be greater to
pleaſe my Vnderſtāding,
than my Senſe.
         
         
            43
            It is a common ſaying,
that a continuall companion
is a mans ſhadovv.
This ſaying is neuer ſo
true, as when a ſubſtantiall
fellow hath an Aſſe,
and a ſhadowe to aſſociate

him. And as ſhadows
cannot be ſeene in darkneſſe,
but by light; no
more can darke and dull
vnderſtandings diſcerne
this ſhadow frō this ſubſtance:
for, that cannot
bee diſcouer'd without
the light of ſome bright
Intellect.
         
         
            44
            An Hypocrite thinkes
himſelfe the vviſeſt of
men: but, at laſt he finds
it otherwiſe. He thinks,
that his knauerie is vnſeene,
becauſe it is vnpuniſht:
but, hee is deceiued.
For, not onely the
ſearcher of hearts ſees

him, but alſo men (who
can gueſſe at hearts) will
at length eſpie him. For,
as hee that weares another
mans garment, will
at length bee diſcouered
either by the ouerlength,
too ſhortneſſe, or
ouer-wideneſſe, or ſome
other default of the raiment:
ſo he that puts on
an outward habite of ſincerity,
of which he neuer
had the loweſt inward
tincture, will in time bee
found faulty through the
want of ſome thing, or
other, requiſite to ſuch a
holy profeſſor. I will not
therefore diſſemble, either

with God, or man;
but, profeſſe that liuing,
which I will pronounce
dying.
         
         
            45
            Some will imitate
Great men thogh it be in
the greateſt vices. Theſe
are miſs-led by opinion.
For, as a golden rule, being
crooked, cānot meaſure
a thing, ſo well, as
a plaine ſtraight ſtick: ſo
neither can wee ſquare
our actions by the vnruly
liues of Princes ſo fitly,
as by the plain, euen, and
vertuous courſes of the
Poor. I will honor Greatneſſe:
but, I will both

honour & imitate goodnes;
and will not hold
him good who is great,
but him great who is
good.
         
         
            46
            A drunkard is no good
ſecret-keeper. It is the
property of a drunkard,
to diſgorge his boſome,
with his ſtomak; to empty
his minde, with his
maw. I will, therefore,
not tell a bibber what I
would not heare againe;
leaſt I heare of it againe,
from thoſe to whom I
dare not auouch it againe.
         
         
            47
            Some ſay all they hear;

& report that with confidence,
which was related
to them with doubt.
Theſe alwayes purchaſe
laughter; and now and
then peril. I wil not, therfore,
tell all I heare: but, I
will heare, againe and againe,
that which I tell.
         
         
            48
            Curioſity, and Inquiſition,
are two great enemies
to Wiſedome One
being demaunded what
Caeſar whiſpered in his
eare, made anſwere, that
Caeſar tolde him, hee
would inuent a very
ſtrange puniſhment for
ſuch as pried into his

words, and actions. This
Vice is very incident to
young Courtiers: who
inquire after the diſcourſes
and courſes of Ioue &
Iuno; of the King and
Queene. I will not aske
what I ſhould not aske;
leaſt I hear what I would
not heare.
         
         
            49
            There is nothing ſo
much to bee deſired in
this world, as health;
Without it, the body
cannot trauell; nor the
ſoule well diſcourſe.
Without it, Kings eſteem
themſelues more
miſerable than Beggers;

and would giue their
Kingdomes for an houre
of eaſe. I will vſe health,
as I do my deareſt friend.
whome I detaine by all
meanes I can: and, going
away, I ſtraight deuiſe
how to get him againe.
         
         
            50
            No vice gets a man ſo
many enemies, as Pride.
The humble loath the
proud man, becauſe hee
is ſo farre different from
their ſtraine: and the
haughtie hate him, becauſe
hee would equall

any thing, it ſhall bee of
my humilitie.

            Some make their bellies
their gods; and pray
to him that feedes the
Foule of the Aire, to feed
them with the Foule of
the Aire. They are not ſo
much ſolicitous what
they ſhall weare to-morrow,
as what they ſhall
eat to-morrow. For my
part, as I will looke to
my bellie, that it ſterue
not; ſo I will looke to it,
that it ſtretch not.

            No humane ſtudy is ſo
profitable, as morall Philoſophie.
No other ſtudy,
ſaith Seneca, can diminiſh

greefes, and ſubdue
Paſsions; nor make a man
more liberall, more iuſt,
more temperate. Seneca
might haue alſo added,
that no other ſtudy can
fit a man with manners,
and a faire behauior. Ferdinand

a ſpeech in a publike

Priſcian a fillip or two.
Which a Biſhop hearing,
ſtarted vp, and ſaid; Caeſar,

The reply was
good; but, not rough enough

for an admonitiō
               
                  •
               o rude. From, hence it is
that Schollars, defectiue
in this ſtudie, are tearmed,
by the Vulgar, Meer
Schollars; that is, Pure

                     •
                  uppies. Before I ſeeke to
know other things, I will

                  •
               eeke to knowe my ſelfe.
         
         
            53
            Conſtancy is no vertue,
if it be (might I ſo ſpeak)
devoted to vice. Change,
in the vitious, is as great
a vertue, as Conſtancie in
the vertuous. I wil therfore
be incōſtant to Vice,
who is incertaine and inſtable
of her ſelfe; & conſtant
to Vertue, who is

euer the ſame, and her
ſelfe.

            They ſay, there is a
kind of reſemblance between
Sleepe and Death.
As therefore hee that is
wearied with the dayes
toyle, doth not grudge to
goe to bed, as hoping to
riſe againe: So I, oppreſt
with the exceſſe & cares
of many dayes, wil gladly
ſleepe-out that long,
ſlowe-pas't Night. Neither
will I think much to
goe to my earthly bed;
as knowing that I ſhall
riſe againe, and put-on an
incorruptible raiment.
         
         
            
            55
            Mariage was ordained
by God for mans comfort:
and yet man often
times abuſeth it to Gods
diſhonour, and his owne
diſcomfort. The reaſon
heerof is, becauſe al bodies
are not of one conſtitution:
and therefore
ſoules, following the humors
of their bodies,
haue not all one diſpoſition.
VVhen therefore
two differing natures
meet, & ſee they are tied
one to the other; they
will cut the very thred of
life, to be looſe, though
it be with the loſs of their

ſoules. Parents, therfore,
do ill, to match thoſe together,
betwixt vvhom
Nature hath placed an
Antipathy, & a loathing.
What a cruell part is it
of a Parent, to marry his
childe to him that hath
moſt, whē ſhee hates him
moſt? I pray God, ſome
of them doe not one day
giue a deare account of
ſome deare ſoules, whoſe
faire bodies they haue
begotten; doing perpetuall
penance, for placing
wealth aboue woorth.
Had I a child, that loath'd
the man that I lik't, I
would ſooner ſend her to

the Church-yard to bee
buried, than to the
Church to be married;
and ſhould thinke, I did
her a greater courteſie, to
wed her to a Graue, than
to Griefe.
         
         
            56
            There is nothing that
man at once glories in,
and grudges at, but Seruice.
Hee is proud, when
hee thinks himſelfe the
ſervant of God: and hee
is abiect, when hee conſiders
that hee is ſubiect to
his fellow ſubiects. Hee
mutters againſt God, accuſing
him of iniuſtice,
for that hee dimmes his

bright beginning, with a
baſe ſucceſsion; & made
him not only to his own
glory, but alſo to augmēt
the vaine glory of men.
The very name of King,
is as an allarum to ſtir &
rouſe vp his envy: and he
feares him with the ſame
feare, that he does the diuell.
Man is deceiued: for,
the Deity is ſerued not
onely in the Deity, but in
Magiſtrates, in Parents,
in Tutors; & in all thoſe,
whom hee, that is aboue
all, hath placed aboue vs.
I will not therefore think
I ſerue God onely, when
I immediatly obey his

will; but alſo, when I obey
the wills of thoſe,
whom hee wills me to obey:
& I wil make a holy
vow, of an idle complement;
vowing my ſelfe
the ſervant of his ſeruants.
         
         
            57
            As there are few good
Phyſicians for the body:

                  •
               o there are not many for
the ſoule. As thoſe of the
bodie let many die, for
want of skill: ſo thoſe of
the ſoule let manie periſh,
becauſe they knowe
not how to apply themſelues
vnto them. I haue
ſeene an Empirick preſcribe

a cold remedy for
a colde diſeaſe; like thoſe
who ſeek to cure the deſperation
of Gods mercie,
with the declaration
of his iuſtice. As therfore
the Phyſician of the bodie
is not eſteemed, except
hee can giue a reaſon
for what hee does; no
more is the Phyſician of
the ſoule to be valued, vnleſſe
hee can giue a reaſon
of that hee ſaies. GOD
hath left to his Miniſters,
weapons to wound, and
balmes to heale; Keyes
to open, & keyes to ſhut:
but, ſome of them wanting
theological prudencie,

manage theſe things
amiſſe. As, therefore,
knowing the conſtitution
of mine owne body, I
will giue the Phyſician
direction in ſom things:
ſo, knowing well the ill eſtate
of mine own ſoule,
I will in ſome things ſupply
the defect and ignorance
of my ghoſtly Phyſician.
         
         
            58
            It is a common ſpeech,
that Euery man is either
a foole or a Phyſician: that
is, he knowes, what does
him good, and takes it;
and look what does him
hurt, hee refuſes it. It

fares not ſo in matters of
the ſoule. For, in thoſe,
moſt are fooles: and few
are Phyſicians; like childrē,
coueting that which
harmes them, and flying
that which helps them. I
care not if I be a foole in
my bodily diet, ſo I be a
Phyſician for the health
of my ſoule.
         
         
            59
            It is a thing worthy the
conſideratiō; that thogh
the ſoule be her ſelfe impriſoned
in the body, yet
ſhee cannot endure that
her priſon ſhould be impriſoned.
Of this there is
a two-folde reaſon: firſt,

becauſe ſhee loues not to
be double walled in; and,
ſecondly, this brings to
her mind, her owne impriſonment,
vvith the
thraldome, and ſubiection
ſhee liues in to the
Senſe. Yet withall, tis a
thing remarkable in her,
that ſhee is neuer ſo glad,
as when ſhee hath giuen
her body the ſlip, & left
it impriſoned in the
Graue: though at Natures
firſt motion, ſhe was loth
to part from it; as hauing
dwelt ſo long in it. Lord,
let my bodie goe to his
earthly priſon, that my
ſoule may enioy that heauenly

liberty. So ſhall ſhe
bee free of Heauen, and
free from Earth.
         
         
            60
            Examples, taken from
Great men, hurt more,
than if they were taken
from Poore. The reaſon
is, becauſe adverſitie
makes a man know him
ſelfe; whereas proſperity
makes him knowe himſelfe
too well. Now, it is
more ſafe to follow him,
that knowes him ſelfe,
than him that does not.
For, as a true knowledge
of God, and of his truth,
is the beginning of diuine
wiſedome: ſo a true

knowledge of a mans
ſelfe, is the beginning of
humane. I will therfore
ſooner imitate thoſe whō
miſery hath tamed, than
thoſe whom ioyes haue
made wilde.
         
         
            61
            It is a great follie, to
write, and print things
fooliſh. Things fooliſh I
call things lewd, & void
of ſenſe. Tis ſtrange, that
man ſhould not bee content,
that onely the preſent
generation ſhould
call him foole; but, that
poſterity alſo ſhold prick
& picke him out for one.
For my part, I will not

impart that knowledge
to any man, which may
make him forget himſelfe;
and (when hee comes to
remember himſelfe) may
make him knowe that I
forgot my ſelfe.
         
         
            62
            All flatterers are odious,
and dangerous; and
aboue all others, the Creeper.
The firſt and moſt
pernitious that euer was,
was a Creeper, & beguiled
the Woman; vvho
thoght that ſuch a crawler
could not haue ſuch
craft, as afterward ſhee
found he had. Such Flatterers
are poyſon to

Princes, and oftentimes
a bane to the beſt diſpoſed.
Flattery is now-a-dayes
admitted into the
Courts of Princes: nay,
into the boſome of Princes;
not cōſidering that
though her ward below,
yet ſhee aymes high, and
hits thoſe ſooneſt vvho
lie higheſt. Thoſe Courts
are as happy that want
her, as thoſe are curſed &
vnhappy that haue her.
         
         
            63
            As the ſtomack if it be
fedde a long time with
one meate, at length
loathes the ſame: ſo the
ſoule deſpiſes ordinary

& accuſtomed diſcourſe.
I will therefore feede my
ſoule with varietie; but,
not with confuſion.
         
         
            64
            Euery man thinks, that,
which is oppoſed to the
extreameſt of his griefes,
to be mans chiefe felicity.
The poor man iudges
riches, the ſicke man
health, the priſoner liberty,
to bee the higheſt
happineſſe. I my ſelfe,
when I haue been diſcontented
(as I haue beene
often) haue thought content
to be the beſt bliſſe:
and I often fall into the
relapſe, and imbrace

that opinion. Hence-forward,
I will place my felicity
in thoſe things,
which may bring me to
that neuer fading felicity:
and if my ſoule haue content
heere, I will thinke
that ſhee is contented
with this world; and ſo
hath loſt the only marke
of her immortality.
         
         
            65
            God lookes for moſt
honour from thoſe, to
whom hee hath giuen
greateſt honor. As Princes
haue the higheſt
place vpon Earth; ſo
ſhould they do the greateſt
homage to Heauen.
         
         
            
            66
            Nothing in this life is
ſo vnſauory as Old-age.
The ſadnes of mans laſt
dayes, is ſufficient to pay
him for the folly of the
firſt. The neerer Age
comes to her growth, the
neerer Beauty is to her
bane. For, in this penſiue
time, euery thing
withers, and groweth
old, but Euill: and that
retaines his full vigour.
Lord, let my ſoule then
flouriſh when my body
fades: and let the concord
of my minde fight
againſt the diſcord of my
body.
         
         
            
            67
            Nothing is ſo terrible
to the greateſt part of
mortality, as Death.
This little leane dwarfe
will beard a Monarch, in
the midſt of his Army;
making him ſhake, that
whilome ſhook Towers,
and made the Earth it
ſelfe tremble with the
weight of his Hoaſte.
Great Alexander was a
little childe in this: and
though he had often met
Death face to face, yet at
laſt he turned his back to
him, and would haue hid
himſelfe from him; as
hoping to be inuiſible to

his inuiſible Enemy.
What an abſurdity is it
in a man to ſeek to choak
Nature! or to grudge her
the voyding of her excrements!
As when I was
borne, another died: ſo I
will conſider, that when
I die, another is borne.
If Nature bee wearie of
mee, I will bee weary of
my ſelfe: I were a foole
if I ſhould not. For, as no
man can play vpon a
broken inſtrument; no
more can any ſoule recreate
her ſelfe with a bad
inſtrumentaliz'd body. If,
therefore Life flie from
me, I will not flie from

Death.
         
         
            68
            When men are calumniated,
they growe angry:
and if they be reprehended
for any predominant
vice in them, they
ſeeke to excuſe and extenuate
it. I will not do ſo;
but, will hearken to Epictetus:
who wils mee,
not to deny the ſinnes
mine enemy taxes mee
with; but, to reproue his
ignorance: in that, being
vnacquainted with the
infinitie of my crimes, he
layes only two or three
to my charge; whereas
indeede I am guilty of a
million.
         
         
            
            69
            As Sin ſold the world
to Death: ſo Death
bought the world at the
hands of Sinne; it being
the will of the heauenly
Father, with the death of
one to buy euerlaſting
life for all. Bleſſed be he
then, that died the curſed
death of the Croſſe, that
wee may lead a bleſſed
life without croſſes.
         
         
            70
            Chriſt himſelfe ſayes,
that Many are called, but
few are choſen. Many
are call'd Chriſtians,
who are not choſen to
liue with Chriſt. Many

are in the Church, that
are not of the Church:
and many viſible members
there are, which belong
not to the inuiſible
body; nor receiue their
motion from the inuiſible
Head. We, whoſe
ſoules look vpon others
throgh the dimme ſpectacles
of Senſe, doe often
times take a Iudas for a
Nathana
                     •
                  ll, and (contarily)
a Simon Peter, for
a Simon Magus. Let vs
then ſpare to iudge; leaſt
wee be iudged to bee vniuſt,
by that iuſt Iudge, at
the dreadful day of Iudgment.
I, I: this is a 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
courſe; and this wil I obſerue:
becauſe I knowe
not, whether or no, the
Saul I ſee novv, may
proue a Paul to-morow.
         
         
            71
            The world delights in
thoſe, that delight in it.
The reaſon therfore, why
the world cōtemnes me,
is becauſe it is cōtemned
of mee. So then there
muſt be a mitigation on
both ſides. To a mitigation
I may be brought;
to a ſubiection, neuer.
         
         
            72
            The diuell is neuer ſo
buſie, as when a man is
idle. Hee hath no ſo fit

inſtrument to worke by,
as by Sloth: which is, indeed,
the mother of vice.
I will therefore abandon
this mother; leaſt in time
ſhe bring mee to that father.
         
         
            73
            Many pray: but, fewe
pray aright. Some preſume
to beg that, which
God in his iuſtice cannot
grant: and others againe
deſpaire to craue that,
which God in his mercy
will not deny. I will not
therefore begge all that
which I would; but, all
that which I ſhould.
         
         
            
            74
            There is nothing in
this world, that all men
ſhunne ſo much, as Baſeneſſe:
yet many run into
it, becauſe few know the
true definition of it. Opinion
ſtyles many things
baſe, which Vertue calls
bright, and glorious. We
ſee Gentlemen aſham'd,
and hang downe their
heads, when they looke
vp to the place, vvhere
their Anceſtors ſate. And
why doe they this? Becauſe
they doe not think
it any diſparagement, to
decline from the vertue
of their Anceſtors; but,

from their riches. If Pouertie
take-vp her reſidence
in mee, or change
beings with me; yet ſhall
ſhe neuer make me think
my ſelfe baſe, ſo long as
Vertue leaues mee anie
one ſparke of her brightneſſe.
         
         
            75
            The baſeſt griefe of
all, is that, which receiues
his birth frō the death of
a Horſe or a Cow; or
from the loſſe of the two
too high-priz'd Metalls.
Phy vpon it, that a man
ſhould hurt his internall
ſubſtāce, for the want of
externall. If the Sun and

Moone ſhine vpon mee, I
ſhall thinke they doe me
a ſufficient fauour; without
preſuming to implore
their deſcenſion in
to my pockets: but, if the
Sunne and Moone, that
is, Gold & Siluer, vouchſafing
to make my pockets
their Spheres, ſhall
afterwards (out of their
Planeticall inconſtancie)
skippe out, and wander
frō me; I wil not mourn,
and ſay, I haue loſt them:
but, that I haue rendred,
and ſent them backe to
him, who ſent, and gaue
them vnto mee.
         
         
            
            76
            Pouertie lyes begging
in the ſtreets, and no man
pitties her. The reaſon is,
becauſe it is againſt the
nature of man to pittie a
cōmon enemy to Mankind.
Man ſhould conſider,
that though Pouertie
bee his worldly enemy,
yet ſhe is his ſpirituall
friend.
         
         
            77
            Euery thing hath his
fit application: but, few
find it. Some, by the extraordinary
application
of a thing common, will
bring the Reader both
into admiration and delight.

Others againe, by
an vnwittie application,
make non Senſe; and infuſe
lothing into the nice
ſtomack of the Reader I
wil apply nothing, which
may not imply ſomething.
         
         
            78
            All men cry-out for
plaine dealing: but, fewe
loue the trade. It is an
old Prouerb, that he that
vſeth it long, ſhall die a
beggar. Sure I am, that
hee, who vſeth it euer,
ſhall die rich: Hee that

                  •
               aw him in ſecret, wil reward
him in ſecret. Hee
ſhall enter, and inhabite

heauen, and partake of
that true treaſure; wheras
the hypocrite leaues
his wealth behind him,
and carries his woe with
him.
         
         
            79
            Eating, and drinking
too much, are two great
vices. Yet, of the two, too
much eating is the greater.
To drink too much,
comes often times from
conſtraint: but, to eat too
much, proceeds from a
mans inordinate appetite.
Hee that is a drunkard,
may iuſtlie blame
others: but, he that is a
glutton, can iuſtly blame

none but himſelfe. I wil,
therfore, make my appetite
conformable to my
digeſtion: ſo ſhal I be ſure
neither to eat too much,
nor too little.
         
         
            80
            Some fearing their
names ſhould die, build
houſes; to make poſteritie
know, that they once
were, and were wealthy.
This indeede tells the
world that they had purſes;
but, not that they
had pates. He is the man,
who truſts not to oftentripping
Tradition; but
pleads his owne Cauſe to
Poſteritie; making her

confeſſe, that hee was a
man of deeds, thogh not
a man of droſſe.
         
         
            81
            A great mans fauor is
hardly got, & eaſily loſt.
Hee keeps a man to ſerue
his turne; but, not to obſerue
his turnings. The
greateſt part of his followers,
are like his horſes:
they carry him; and
hee guides them. That
horſ which offers to fling
him, or that is not tēdermouth'd,
hee puts off, as
a head-ſtrong Iade. It is
better therefore to ſerue
God, who is voyd of all
accidents, and humors;

than man, who by them
is made voide of reaſon:
and hee that is moſt vnfit
to obſerue man, is the
moſt fit to ſerue God.
         
         
            82
            The Church militant,
labours to bee vnited to
the triumphant; and
the triumphant longs for
the vnion. Lord then
ioyne them; and let ſorrow
ſeuer them no longer.
         
         
            83
            Nature binds men one
to the other; but, neuer
ſo faſt as when ſhe chains
them together with the
linkes of vertue. Nature

may make mee loue my
kinred: but, Vertue will
make mee doe more.
         
         
            84
            Hee that hates a man,
becauſe he hath ſome notorious
vices, is raſh and
vnaduiſed: for, if hee did
but looke into the ſame
man, he ſhould find ſome
eminent vertues in him.
I will not ſhunne his preſence
that hath a good
nature, and but one vertue;
as knowing my ſelfe
to be all vitious.
         
         
            85
            It is an vſuall ſpeech,
that nothing is ſaide,
vvhich hath not beene

ſaid before. If it be meāt,
that no words are ſpoke,
which haue not beene
ſpoke before, that is falſe:
and if the meaning bee,
that nothing is thought,
vvhich hath not beene
thought before, that is
falſe too. For, we ſee that
euery day reveales a new
ſecret to the world; and
that for neuer heard-of
thinges, wee are faine to
faine neuer heard of
words. I will rather think
all braines are exhauſted,

            Vertue is placed euen
in the middeſt of Vice.

Liberalitie, is placed betwixt
Auarice and Prodigality;
Valour, betwixt
Cowardiſe & Raſhneſſe;
Mercie, betwixt Cruelty,
and a fond Lenity. Take
courage, Vertue: thou
ſhalt once ſhake-off thy
priuation; and put-on a
habit, without reiterated
actions.
         
         
            87
            Hee that meets with a
contentious foole, doth
wiſely in granting all hee
obiects: for, it is more
policie, to gaine a friend
without trouble, than a
foe with it.
         
         
            88
            
               
The ſame holdes with
GOD, that does with
great Lords: he loues to
be well followed and attended.
But, neither deſert,
nor great friends, can
preferre a man to him:
onely thoſe whom hee
likes, hee chooſes. I had
rather follow him, than
go before Emperours.
         
         
            89
            A yong man is like a
wilde horſe; who, if hee
want a curbe, will runne
himſelfe to death. Thoſe
parents, therefore, are
wiſe, who ioyne correction,
with direction; and
keepe thoſe in, who elſe

would laſh-out.
         
         
            90
            It is a thing difficult,
to finde out the humors
of men; becauſe many
diſſemble their diſpoſitions.
This buſineſſe requires
a crafty, and experienced
wit: for, deceit
is neuer ſo ſoon diſcouer'd
as by the deceitfull.
         
         
            91
            Paſsion is the onely enemy
to Wiſedome. He
that conquers this enemy,
makes Wiſedome
his friend.
         
         
            92
            A lingring hatred is

badde. Gods children
are angry, yet ſinne not.
My wrath ſhall go down
with the ſunne: but, my
loue ſhall endure longer
than the ſunne it ſelfe.
         
         
            93
            Affectation makes a
wiſe man a foole; but, if it
meete with a foole, it
makes him an intolerable
Aſſe. In theſe later,
lame times, we ſee many
affect defects; and to bee
proud of that, which indeede
they ſhould bee
aſham'd of. Since Nature
hath made me ſomwhat
better than a foole;
let mee beware, that affectation

make mee not
worſe than a foole.
         
         
            94
            It is a queſtion worth
the inquiring into, whether
or no, all oſtentation
bee to be auoided. The
Philoſophers cried-out,
Sume ſuperbiam quaeſitā
meritis: Aſſume a pride
proportionable to thy merits.
And indeede, both
Morality, and Policy,
perſwade it; for, generally,
wee ſee thoſe vnderualued
of all men, who
vnderualue themſelues.
Yet, the word of God is
to be obſerued, before
the obſeruations of men.
         
         
            
            95
            
               Cōmines obſerues this
in Lewis the XI. that hee
would euen toile, to gain
any man that might either
profit, or hurt him
This is an excellent policie;
and little or nothing
(or rather, in nothing)
repugnant to diuinity.
         
         
            96
            Religion is often made
a cloak to villany. But,
at one time or other, Villany
will caſt-off her
cloak: and he that is wiſe,
will perceiue and deteſt
it. I wonder, that men do
not tremble (as being
before God) when they

diſſemble before men.
         
         
            97
            Nothing ſhould ſo
neerely touch, nor ſo
much moue a Prince, as
a baſe report of his predeceſſour;
though hee
were his vtter enemy.
For, though he himſelfe
lead the life of a bleſſed
Angell; yet, from ſome
mouthes wherein Calumny
cloyſters her
ſelfe) as much imputation
ſhall bee laied vpon
him, as can be caſt vpon
the Diuell; which, his
Succeſſour, in imitation
of him, will winke-at.
How many miniſters of

hell, now-adayes not only
reuile Gods on Earth,
with words, but with
written wordes alſo?
Hiſtoriographers may
lightly touch the faults of
Princes: but, if they raile
at their perſons, they
ceaſe to bee Hiſtorians,
and become maleuolent
Oratours. Princes, therfore,
ſhould not imagine
that their preſent fame
wil be permanent; but,
ſhould take this preſcribed,
or ſom other courſe:
by which, they may as
well ſtoppe the mouthes
of the reuealers of their
vices, and reuilers of their

perſons; as let-looſe the
tongues that trumpetout
their vertues.
         
         
            98
            As, on the one ſide, it
ſauours much of indiſcretion,
to remember a
man of any thing by
which hee hath either
done himſelfe diſgrace,
or receiu'd it frō others:
ſo, on the other ſide, it is
a point of Wiſdome, to
put one in minde of any
action of his brauely performed;
of any ſpeech of
his vtter'd with the aſtoniſhment
of the audience▪
or of any Office in
the Common-wealth,

which hee hath vndergone
with honour, and
with augmentation of
his reputation. Hee that
delights to diſpleaſe men,
will at length reape no
great pleaſure.
         
         
            99
            Humility may bee
without honour: but,
honour cannot be without
humility: if it bee, it
is but baſtard. There is
no ſurer way than this,
to finde-out baſtards, father'd
vpon the Nobility.
         
         
            100
            It is fooliſh, to bragge
of riches, or any external

thing, in the company of
others. For, the better
ſort will thinke it done
in enuy, and emulation
of them: and the worſe
will take it done, in contempt
of them. He that
brags of things without,
hath but little within.
         
         
            101
            If the Miſer did but
looke into what he does,
hee would neuer bee ſo
miſerable. He is euer ſolicitous;
and hath ſcarce
one happy houre in the
courſe of his whole life.
He hoords and layes-vp,
not knowing who ſhall
enioy it: and oftentimes

they enioy it, who lay it
out as faſt; not caring
what become of it. So
that it plainly appeares,
the whole life of an Vſurer
is nothing but miſery
and vexation. O that a
Cormorant did knovve,
how many beautiful bodies
ſtarue, & how many
ſubſtantiall ſoules faint,
for want of his caſh! hee
would not onely willingly
part with all his pelfe,
but ſel his owne body to
ſolace their ſoules. But,
indeed, he is not ſo much
to be blamed: becauſe,
whereas charity begins
at home in others, crueltie

beginnes at home in
him: & he almoſt ſtarues
himſelf, that others, whō
hee ſuffers to ſtarue, may
not take exception. Euery-one
is not guilty of
this Vice. The Prodigall
hath ſuch vſe for his mony
at home, that he can
put none to vſe abroad.
Some get by the vſe
of their mony: he
loſeth by the
vſe of his.
         
         
            
            To Vertue.
            O Great, & glorious
Goddeſſe of the
good; thou ſuter,
and thou vvooer of the
vvicked; thou, without
whō the mightieſt Monarchs
are but poore, &
miſerable; and with whō
the baſeſt Begger is
great, and mighty: thou
Miſtres of ſo many mild
Martyrs; thou Gouerneſſe
of all ſweet diſpoſitions;
thou beginner, cō
               tinuer,

& perfecter of all
honorable actions, Vertue;
to thee I conſecrate
this little languiſhing
Work, together with all
the humble indeauors of
my ſoule. Gracious Miſtreſſe,
as thou haſt hitherto
hardned mee againſt
all the buffets of
hard-fiſted Fortune, and
armed mee againſt the
kicking of Aſſes, and the
hiſsing of Geeſe: ſo giue
me ſtill encouragements
to maintaine thy cauſe againſt
thy black-viſag'd
enemy, Vice. And ſeeing
thou art a Miſtres of many
ſeruants, I muſt not

only remember my ſelf,
but beſeech thee alſo, to
remember all thoſe that
ſuffer for thy ſake. Giue
an end to their miſerie:
leaſt miſery cauſe their
end; and ſo thou be deſtitute
of ſeruants: for, the
next Age (take the word
of thy deuoted) will not
afford thee many. Make
much therefore, make
much of thoſe, vvho by
thee are made more than
earthly: let them adorne
earth yet a while; and let
vs a little longer triumph
in them heer, before they
themſelues triumph in
heauen. The world hath

need of them, bright Empreſſe:
The world hath
neede of them; in that
pretious precepts neuer
ſhine ſo much, as vvhen
they are ſet in examples;
nor examples, as vvhen
they are ſette in curious
creatures.
            The Philoſopher
ſaith, that, if the vvorld
had the full view of thee,
thou wouldeſt ſo dazle
the eyes of Mortalitie,
that admiration vvould
lay it in a tranſe. But,
ſome cannot behold thy
eſſence: and therefore,
we were much to blame,
if we ſhould not honour

thee much in thoſe, in
whom wee ſee euen a little
of thee. But, if we ſee
almoſt all thee, in ſom other
ſelfe of thine; then
pardon vs, if we giue you
both alike worſhip. As I
began, ſo I end with my
ſelfe; and beſeech thee
once more, that I may be
no more: I meane, that
my maſsie part may fall,
before my ethereall fall
into any thing baſe, or
belowe the height of that
blood, which hath runne
through the veines of ſo
many valiant & truly honorable
perſons. If thou
grant this, great Goddeſſe,

I vvill then make
this my Motto,
            Virtute tutè.
         
         
            
            An Aduertiſement
from the Tranſlator,
to the Reader.
            VVHoſoeuer ſhall
come to the reading
of this Oration,
let him know, that
it is not tranſlated like
Quae genus, to teach any
man to conſtrue. I haue
not rendred verbum verbo:
but, verba verbo; and
in ſome places, verbum
verbis. As in Printing,
many faults vſually eſcape
in the first Proofe: ſo many
errors in the first Edition.

I confeſſe, through
haſte, I haue not alwayes
cloſely followed the Authors
ſteppes. If euer it be
reprinted, all ſhall bee redreſſed.
In the mean time,
it may bee vvell vnderstood,
though it bee ill
tranſlated. I had neuer
vndertaken it, had it not
been written againſt Calumny:
who hath wronged
mee; and may heereafter,
more, than euer Fortune
did, or can doe. No, no: I
had rather contemplate a
thouſand lines, than turn
one; the taske beeing more
noble: Sith, as Ariſtotle
ſaith, Deus, ſi qua felicitate

gaudet, gaudet contemplatione.
Beſides; I
plainely ſee, that the only
thing which hath brought
Scholars out of requeſt,
hath been Tranſlating. Let
theſe ſuffice.
         
         
            An Oration of
Iuſtus Lipſius, againſt
Calumny.
            THis day, this day,
am I to ſpeake of
Calumny, and to
draw and lugge this Vice
into the light. Thou
God, who art goodneſſe,
brightneſſe, and all loue,

bee a light to the ſteps of
my dimme Intellect, and
lead me againſt a vice,
of all vices the greateſt
enemy to thee. Moue
my minde and tongue,
that I may inſtill innocency
and humanity into
Humanity; winning
men to ſhew honeſty,
peace, & charity, in their
liues, diſcourſes, and writings.
Calumny I heere
define to be, a guilefull,
priuie wounding, and diminiſhing
of anothers
fame, either in word, or
with penne. Calumny is
ſo called a caluendo:
which (being an olde,

and obſolete word) implied
as much, as to abuſe,
or deceiue. For, Calumny,
in generall, lieth,
and beguileth (as heereafter
I will ſhew) and
deriues her authority frō
lying, and deceiuing. The
Graecians named her

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; and that, verie
properly: becauſe ſhee
pearces, ſtickes, & ſtrikes-through,
with the all-harming
dart of her venom'd
tongue. So that
Calumny hath two propoſed
ends: the one, to
deceiue; which the Latines
conſider'd: the other,
to hurt; which the

Graecians oft obſerued.
O Vice of Vices! and yet
in theſe Times what is
more frequent? what
more inſeparable companion
of publique, and
priuate ruines? I may yet
adde, and ask, what hath
beene more neglected by
moderne, and antient
Writers? Wherefore,
ſince there is not any one
found (to my knowledge)
who hath written
of it, or againſt it; I
hope, this Treatiſe of it
will not bee vnprofitable
to you, nor inglorious to
mee, who firſt beginne
to lay it open, and to explane

it with my plaine
ſtile. Three principall
things then there are,
from which the preſent
diſcourſe muſt be deriu'd.
Firſt, I will ſhew how filthy,
and loathſome Calumny
is; ſecondly, how
pernicious; thirdly, how
to be auoided. Whilſt I
ſeuerally diſcourſe of
theſe, ſomewhat amply,
and acutely, I ſhall deſire
this faire Audience, not
onely to lend mee their
minds, but their eares;
and to fill and guide the
ſailes (as I may ſay) of
my Oration, with the
Zephyrus, or gentle gale

of their loue-breathing
thoughts.
            As for the filthineſs of
Calumny, it cannot bee
more cleerely prooued,
than by this two-folde
argument: to weet, that
it ſelfe, and all thoſe in
whom it dwels, are moſt
loathſome. The perſons,
that harbour it, are branded
with theſe three
markes; baſe, idle, pratling:
So truely, by mee
termed baſe, that I deny
not only any good, but
any indifferently good,
or lofty ſpirit, euer to
haue been blemiſht with
this blot. Examine the

olde, and theſe our moderne
Times, and you
ſhall neuer reade, ſee, or
heare, that any haue
beene prone to this vice,
but onely ſad, and maligne
natures, envying
others and diſtruſting
themſelues; whom melancholy
Saturne hath
blaſted with his ſtarre.
Did you neuer ſee little,
cowardly dogs barke at
gueſts, that durſt not bite
beaſts? Why, ſuch are
theſe worſer ſort of men;
who are borne onely to
hurt and vexe the harmeleſſe.
I ſay, they are borne
to that end; becauſe they

doe ſo leane, and incline
to this vice, that they are
neuer quiet, but when
they haue made others
vnquiet. Their ſecond
marke is Idleneſſe: than
which nothing is more
apparent; ſince the firſt
ſparke, and tinder of Calumny,
is Sloth: for, no
man will haue leaſure to
enquire into other mens
affaires, who is deteined
by his owne. In ſluggiſh,
and droniſh people, this
godleſſe Goddeſſe takesvp
her lodging, and there
laies the foundation of
her kingdome. Hee that
denies this, let him but a

little frequent the Palaces
of Princes, and places
of Pleading: in
which, occaſion & matter
of Calumny is daily,
and aboundantly, ſowen
by thoſe, who make this
their only buſineſſe, To
walke and talke. VVhatſoeuer
is publikely, or
priuately done, is there
cenſured, and ſcourged.
The Prince, & his Counſellours
are ſaid to doe amiſſe:
one man is ſaid to
haue done this; another
man to haue ſpoken that.
To conclude; no report
of any man can ſtand
with them vnblemiſht,

and vnſlandred. And if
wiſe, and experienced
men did this, I could the
better beare with it: but,
now, men not only moſt
idle, but alſo moſt ignorant,
do buſie themſelues
in thoſe things, to whoſe
height, their ſenſe, and
vnderſtanding will not
reach. As in a ſhip an
vnskilful paſſenger is not
to bee endur'd, that teaches,
& chides the Mariners,
when he himſelfe
will lend hand neither to
the Rudder, nor to the
Ore: ſo alſo, vnto vs, theſe
emptie veſſells muſt
needes bee moleſtfull,

which ſound moſt, and
haue leaſt liquor in them.
To be briefe; their laſt
marke is prattling. And,
indeede, how ſhould
they be other? ſince it is
proper to theſe babblers,
not only to ſpeak much,
but much euill. Haue any
of you at any time
ranked your ſelues with
thoſe head-ſtrong vntamed
people, who haue,
as Pindar ſaith, vncurbed
mouthes? If you haue;
tell me, was not the greateſt
part of their talke
not onely of ſome body,
but againſt ſome body?
ſurely, it was. For, they

vent things, both heard,
and vnheard; mingling
things true and certaine,
with things vaine, and
vncertaine. And, as in a
lake of Iudaea, call'd Aſphaltes,
nothing ſinks; but
vvhatſoeuer is caſt-in,
ſwimmes vpon the ſurface
of the water: ſo, nothing
goes to the bottome
of their boſomes;
all things keep the toppe,
and ſlote ouer. But, to
ſay the truth, how ſhould
they fauor others, when
they cannot ſpare themſelues?
For, it is the nature
of this diſeaſe, to
make them raile againſt

themſelues, when they
haue nothing to ſpeake
againſt others. As in an
extreame & long dearth,
our bodies, for want of
nouriſhment, feede vpon
themſelues: ſo falles it
out with them.
            I haue now ſufficiently
diſcourſed vnto you
of the Minions of Calumny:
I will therefore
(as order requires) bring
her ſelfe vpon the Stage,
with her owne true coū
               tenance.
I confeſſe, all
vice to be deteſtable, vglie,
and loathſome; but,
this aboue all other:
vvhich doth not onely

reigne in filthy people,
but is alſo begotten, and
borne of loathſome Parents.
The Poets faine
their Chimaera to haue
three bodies. They fain:
but, I dare ſweare, that to
the compoſition of Calumny,
the mixtion of
three vices is neceſsarie.
For, Lying, and Enuy are
her Parents; and Curioſitie,
her Nurſe. Conſider,
with your ſelues,
vvhat a faire infant this
muſt needes bee, which
receiues her beeing from
three ſuch foule vices. I
ſaid, and ſaid truly, that
Lying was her father; becauſe

it inſpires and animates
Calumny: which
without Lying, languiſheth,
hauing neither life
nor ſoule. What Backbiter
was euer yet content
with the naked truth only?
which of them vvas
euer yet pleaſed to call a
figge a figge? And, indeede,
hee cannot chooſe
but doe ſo; in that hee
hath no power to hurt,
nor can attaine to his
propoſed end, if he keep
himſelfe within the limits
of truth. Therefore hee
addes to euery thing and
as that ſound of neighbouring
Valleies (which

wee call Eccho) returnes
wo or three words, for
one: ſo he doubles things
heard, and ſeene. Haue I
in a word or two complained
of any man? hee
wil ſay, I haue ſharply accuſed
him. Haue I made
doubt of any thing? hee
will ſay, I haue carped at
all. Haue I my ſelfe ſome
doubtfull ſpeach, or ſentence,
hee wil chooſe the
worſe ſenſe. In a word;
as the Phyſicians ſay of
their cupping glaſſes,
that they draw-out nothing
but the moſt impure
blood of all: ſo I
may more truly ſay of a

Slanderer, that he neither
attracts, nor receiues any
thing vnto him, or into
him, that is not euill.
But, I would hee did detract
onely: for, oftentimes,
he addes, and reports
thoſe things to
haue been done, & ſpoke
by vs, which we neuer ſo
much as dream'd of. As
Spiders, with a woonderfull
Art, bring-foorth
threds and cobwebs, out
of their bodies: ſo, hee
begets, and weaues ſubtle
ſnares with his wit. I
haue truly & ſufficiently
ſhewed, that Lying is the
Father of Calumny: it

now reſteth that I proue
Envy to be her Mother;
who in the malignant
wombe of her wit, conceiues,
beares, and at laſt
brings forth this impious
infant. This is eaſily proued,
by the maners and
deeds of Calumniators:
for, they ſildome drawe
that fame-defacing weapon
vpon baſe people, &
men of their owne coate;
but, vpon thoſe vvhom
they ſee to excell others
in vertue, in learning, or
in ſome other thing worthy
admiration. As Runners
doe not looke backe
for the laggers, but ſtriue

to out-ſtrip the formoſt:
ſo, Calumny purſues the
better ſort.
            It vvas obſerued in
the ſportes of old, that
Bulls would roare, and
wex enrag'd at the ſight
of any redde, or purple
thing; which, notwithſtanding
are the moſt
faire of all colours: the
like may be ſeene in theſe
men; whoſe rancor is ſtirred
vp by Vertue.
            Laſt of all, I added, that
Curioſitie was the Nurſe
of Calumny. And that,
very truly; ſith ſhe ſeeds
and foſters this Damſell
with the long ſought-for

meat of ſpeeches and rumors.
Take her frō Calumny,
and what can ſhe
doe? Shee will ſtraight
wex weak, faint, & emptie;
hauing more will, thā
power to hurt. For, ſhee
hath matter miniſtred to
her, by Curioſity: who,
dwelling neuer at home,
but ranging alwaies abroad,
enters not onely
the houſes, but the minds
of all men; beeing euer
watchful, neuer ſleeping.
It is ſhe, it is ſhe, that gathers
reports together, &
vents them to him that
next accoſteth her, ſaluting
him thus: Giue me

your hand. What news?
What's done at Court?
How ſtand the affaires
of England? Hovv, of
France? What doth Titius?
What doth Seius?
Theſe things, & other
of like nature, dooth ſhe
pry into, & meddle with;
yet neuer growes ful, nor
ſatisfied. But, as a putrid
and ſcabbed limbe
delights to bee ſcratcht,
and rubb'd: ſo ſhe itcheth
for ſharpe and opprobrious
ſpeeches. Neither
onely hath ſhee itching,
and greedy eares, but
quicke & pearcing eyes:
which when ſhee opens,

what is it ſhee ſees not?
Yea, euen thoſe things
which ſhee ſees not. She
thē ſearcheth into things
revealed, and vnreuealed.
Tiberius, the Emperour,
is reported to haue beene
ſo quick-ſighted, that he
could ſee as well in the
night, as in the day: but,
this may more fitlie bee
ſaid of Curioſity; in that,
neither darkneſſe, nor ſolitude,
can keepe-out her
all-ſearching ſight. Dooſt
thou ſhut thy doores? ſhe
will pearce throgh them.
Dooſt thou tie-vp thy
tongue? ſhee will prie into
thy boſome. Dooſt

thou ſhun the ſocietie of
men? ſhee wil neuertheleſſe
find thee out. As
Flies, and ſuch little creatures,
can by no meanes
be kept-out; no more can
ſhee, by any Art. Shee is
ſole Queen of that Familie
of the Curio's, whom
the Comick Poet verie
wittily thus paints forth;
They haue a great care of
other mens affaires. They
would ſeeme to knowe all
things; but, indeed, know
nothing. They know what
the King whiſperd in the
eare of the Queene; and
what Ioue diſcourſed of
with Iuno. Nay, which

is more; they know things
which neuer were, nor euer
ſhall be.
            
            By this time, I am
ſure, you euidently perceiue
the vglineſſe of Calumny;
which lodgeth in
baſe, filthy perſons, and
hath like Parents; begottē
by Lying, brought
forth by Envy, & broght
vp by Curioſitie. Come
on now, and follow mee
to the Miſchiefe that attends
her: which I thoght
good to make the ſecond
part of my race. And before
I runne it, pauſe with
mee awhile, and refreſh
your minds.
            
               
The Miſchiefe in Calumny,
is Forcible & Variable:
& that ſo great (I
auerre it ſeriouſly, without
an Hyperbole) as I find
the like in no other vice. I
ſay, Forcible, becauſe ſhe
wounds deeply, & priuily.
Variable, in that (for
the moſt part) ſhe neither
leaues any thing, nor any
body, vntouched. Let vs
handle euery one of theſe
by themſelues. That ſhe
wounds deeply, the holy
Prophet wil witnes with
mee, crying-out; Their
teeth are darts and arrowes:
and their tongue is
a ſharpe ſword. Neither

is there any great difference
betwixt the words
of this diuine man, & of
that Spartan, who being
demaunded whether, or
no his ſword were ſharp
enough, replyed, More
keene than Calumny; intimating
therby, that no
edge of iron and ſteele,
could compare in keeneneſſe
with the edge of the
tongue. VVhat cannot
this touch? or what toucheth
it, that it toucheth
not to the quick? As that
ſubtill force of Lightning
pearceth through
euery thing: ſo, nothing
can be ſo cloſely ſhut, nor

ſo far remooued, but Calumny
wil burn through
it. And this ſhe doth the
more effectually, in that
ſhee doth it priuily, and
(as I added) by treachery.
How can a weapon
bee avoided, that is not
ſeene? The clowds forewarne
vs of the enſuing
tempeſt; ſmoake of the
enſuing fire; a Spy, of the
approach of the Enemy:
but, the miſchiefe that
comes from a Calumniator,
is ſudden, and vnexpected.
Dooſt thou
thinke hee threatens? he
then flatters. Dooſt thou
take him for thine enemie?

he will induce thee
to belieue that hee is thy
friend; and will firſt tie
thee with the ſnaring
praiſes of his tongue, and
then with the ſame will
wound thee. And as a
Scorpion, if thou handle
him, will ſeeme to play
with thee, till hee get
opportunitie with the
winding of his taile to
ſting thee: ſo, when thou
feareſt little hurt from a
Calumniator, hee hath
thē already harmed thee.
O deteſtable deceite!
which my Hiſtorian (as
from an Oracle) notes,
when hee ſaith, A mans

greatest enemies are his
greateſt praiſers. Giue me
poyſon openly, and I will
beware of it: but, if you
cunningly mingle it with
my meate, or drink, how
can I ſhun it then? The
ſame may bee ſaid of Calumny:
which may truly
be called, poyſoned hony.
It is not a thing difficult
(ſaith ſingular Saluſt)
to a ſtout and valiant
man, to conquer an aſſaulting
enemy; but, good
men neuer ſuſpect, and
therfore neuer go about to
ſhun hidden & vnknown
dangers. How Forcible
and violent the Miſchief

is which proceeds from
Calumny, hath ſufficiently
beene proued: you
ſhall now heare how Variable
or diuers it is. It
doth hurt (as I ſaid before)
in moſt matters,
and to moſt perſons; a
thing more remarquable
in Calumny, than in any
other vice. It hurts not
one, or two; but, many:
If I be luſtfull, two only
are contaminated with
the impurity of the
crime. Say, I am couetous:
it may be I cheate
three, or foure of their
money. If I be drunke,
perhaps I wrong ſome

man with blowes, or
with words. But, with
Calumny it is far otherwiſe:
for, ſhee ſpares no
Age, ſex, nor order; and
may rightly be called a
publique calamity, and
the Phaeton (if I may ſo
ſay) of the Earth's circle.
Who was euer ſo happy,
or ſo wiſe, that could
brag hee was ſafe from
her reach? There was neuer
any. Her tearing
teeth are whetted to hurt
all men; but, thoſe moſt,
who are of moſt merit.
            He that excells in any
thing, is ſure to be troden-downe
by her. As

they, who pull-downe
houſes, doe firſt take a
way the pillars: ſo, Calumny
(deſiring to deſtroy
Mortality) firſt
ſeekes to ſupplant thoſe,
vpon whom the publique
good is builded.
Prudent, honeſt, and
learned men, are her proclaimed
enemies: whoſe
fame ſhee ſometimes
ſhakes with the engines
of reproach; and ſometimes,
againe, ſeekes to
ouerthrow it with the
cunning vndermining of
ſuſpicion. Neither onely
doth ſhe iniure & wrong
ſundry men; but, in ſundry

matters alſo. Nor is
there any thing deare
and pretious to a man,
but ſhe will be ſure with
her wiles either wholly
to bereaue him of it, or
very much to empaire it.
Doe riches delight thee?
She will, if ſhe can, diſpoſſeſſe
thee of them. Doſt
thou reioice in great titles,
and honours? Of
thoſe ſhee will depriue
thee. Dooth any man
place his felicity in his
friends? Here ſhee will
imploy her vttermoſt
art, and ſtrength; and will
ſeuer Laelius from Scipio,
Pylades from Orestes.
               
What is ſo pretious to a
man▪ as his fame? which
to good men is aboue all
goods, and life it ſelfe.
For, riches, and life, are
things brittle, and flitting;
our goods going
often away before vs, &
our liues alwaies with vs:
but, our fame is that
which doth eternize vs;
that only remaines, when
we are rotten. Why, this
fame, this treaſure of the
wiſe, this life-enlightning
gemme, Calumny
dooth daily ſeeke to obſcure,
and vtterly to deface.
For, becauſe ſhee
cannot hurt Vertue it ſelf

(the Chiefe-good in vs)
ſhe ſeekes to ouer-cloud,
and leſſen vertuous actions:
which are, as it were,
the ſhadowes, not the
very images of Vertue.
But, why talke I of men,
and humane affaires? O
good God! ſhee neither
ſpares thee, nor thy heauen.
For ſhee will finde
in diuine matters alſo
ſomething to debate of;
by which ſhe may offend
not only thine, but thee.
It is thy decree, thy
ſanction, that the ſecrets
of the minde be reſerued
for the moderatour of the
minde: neither are the

ſtrings of the heart, to be
plaied vpon by any, but
by him that made them.
But, Calumny violates
this Law: for, now-a-dayes
(O hatefull daies!)
ſhee directs her eyes, and
tongue hither; prying into
this inmoſt Temple.
Shee cries-out, that this
man is not vpright in his
gouernement; that a ſecond
is not valiant; that
a third is a cloſe fellow,
and not open enough. In
a word; what remaines,
but that the thoughts, &
meaning of our mindes
be ſummon'd to appeare
before this calumniating

Iudgement ſeate? Homer,
the true Prince (in my
iudgement) not of Poets
onely, but of all other
men (I vnderſtand Profane)
faines a certaine
Goddeſſe, which he calleth
Ate; from whom all
offence & miſchiefe took
their ſourſe and deriuation.
Vnder the couer of
which fiction, I aſſure
my ſelfe (as certainely as
I now ſpeak and breathe
that he intēded to touch
& twitch Calumny. For,
thus he deſcribeth her:
            A miſchieuous Goddeſſe
(I interprete him ſummarily)
               
vvhich offendeth
all:
            Which toucheth not the
earth; but, walks vpon the
heads of men,
            And hath hurt Iupiter
himſelfe.
            Anſwer me now truly,
and on your word. Was
there euer any Painter,
with a curious and artificiall
pencill, or Oratour
with plentifull Rhetorick,
who vvith more
light and propriety, hath
marked-out the true genuine
forme of odious
Calumnie? I thinke, neuer
any. Hee telleth you,

that ſhee offendeth all.
Iuſt my doctrine; that all
men, in all places, are endangerd
by her. She toucheth
not the earth. True:
for, ſhee ſildom aimes 
                  〈◊〉
               
baſe, earthy, and lowecreeping
ſpirits: but, as it
followeth in the verſe,
ſhee walks vpon the heads
of men; to wit, ſhee directs
her flight to the
higheſt matters, & moſt
eminent perſons. In concluſion;
ſhee hurts Iupiter
himſelfe: (VVho makes
queſtion of it?) either in
caſting Calumnie and aſperſion
vpon diuine and
holy actions; or in not

ſuffering Religiō herſelfe
to goe free and vntoucht
of her venomed tooth.
Theſe are but the villanies,
wherewith ſhee
ſports her ſelf in priuate;
beeing nothing in compariſon
of thoſe vvhich
ſhe commits publiquely,
& in the Courts of Princes.
For, here is her proper
& true throne: heere
ſhee plaies the vvanton,
and curuets within her
circle. But, time ſo ſtraitens
mee, that I cannot
chaſe & purſue this ſubiect
in all particulars.
            Briefely, thus: Whatſoeuer
deceit, oppreſsion,

or villanie hath beene in
any Age, or in any Court
whatſoeuer, it flowed
firſt from this head, from
this fountaine. What
was it, that allured Alexander
to murther ſo
many of his deer friends,
but Calumnie? that
baniſhed Socrates from
his naturall life, Rutilius
from his natiue Cittie,
but Calumny? that fed,
as it were, vvith nevv
blood, and gaue life to
Tiberius, Caligula, and
Nero, and ſo many monſters
of Kings, but this
hateful Calumny? And,

not to ſpeake onelie of
former Times, this Age,
this miſerable Age, doth
ſufficiently teſtifie, that
thoſe flights, thoſe
ſlaughters, thoſe generall
calamities, thoſe Seas, &
inundations of miſerie,
vnder which wee grone,
haue no other birth,
ſourſe, nor Generation,
but from the Riuerets
of Court-Calumnie.
Are your ſoules grieued,
that theſe arrowes of ſedition
ſtick in the bowels
of the Common-vveale?
Calumny fixt thē there.
That the fire of Ciuill

warres hath burned, now
ſo many yeers? Calumny
did firſt kindle it. And we
neuer ſee, or haue ſeene,
any wickedneſſe whatſoeuer,
but infuſed and diffuſed
from this poyſning
Fountaine. Subiects againſt
their Princes,
Princes againſt their ſubiects,
are firſt ſtirred-vp,
kindled, prouoked, & enflamed
(as it were) by this
fanne of words. And as
the Seas, naturally calme,
by the wind grow ſwoln
and enraged: ſo, many
Princes, of good & gentle
diſpoſitions, are ſet on
fire by theſe matches.
            
               
You ſee now the Forcible
& Variable Miſchief,
attēding Calūny. Which
mee thinks our old Chriſtians
did well vnderſtand,
when they named
the father of all ſinnes, or
rather Sinne it ſelfe (that
Monſter from Hell) by a
Greek word, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ;
a Detractor, or one which
is accuſtomed to calumniate:
thinking (it ſeems)
that our moſt malitious
enemy could not bee
made known by a word
of more malice. Neither
did the ancient Lawgiuers,
with leſs iudgemēt,
conſider her vnbridled

and ouer-maſtering violence.
Who, when they
reſtrained all other vices
with lawes and puniſhmēts;
to this one (which
I wonder at) they made
waie for her Cariere;
giuing her free ſcope to
be hurtfull. For, number
vp all the Nations in
the world; I am deceiued,
if you name one, that
(with any ſanction or
penall Law) hath bridled
& ſuppreſt it. The Athenians,
I confeſſe, were
wont to inflict Pecuniary
puniſhments vpon ſuch
offenders: the Romans
burnt them in the foreheads

heads with the letter K.
But, let not this lead anie
man into error: for, they
were onely ſuch as practic'd
it in Courts of Iuſtice,
and in publike accuſations.
What then?
were they either ſo blind,
as not to ſee this miſchief?
or ſo fooliſh, as ſeeing
it, to giue it allowāce
& approbation? Neither
of theſe: but, with great
iudgement & diſcretion
they held any vice vnpuniſhable,
which they
thought vncurable.
            Small Riuers are withſtood
with bayes and
ſluces: but, what Mountaines

can reſi
                  •
               t a cōmon
Deluge? Calumny hath
made an inundation ouer
all the earth: and lurkes
cloſe in the marrow of ill
diſpoſitions and wicked
natures; beeing no longer
eſteem'd-of as a fault; but
as a cuſtom. What ſhold
they do then? VVhy, like
wiſe and diſcreet Phyſicians:
which do not raſhly
handle with their fingers
a Canker, or the
Plague. So as the greatneſſe
and diffuſion of the
euill, hath giuen it this
freedome and enlargement:
neither was it euer
tolerated, but through

deſpair, But, leaſt I ſhold
weary-out my ſelfe, and
detain you with too long
an Oration, I will guyde
my ſhip to her Port or
Hauen, and come to the
third and laſt part; namely,
the Auoyding of Calumny:
which if any
man ſo vnderſtand, as hoping
to be ſecur'd againſt
all Calumny, he deceiues
himſelfe, & requites that
of mee, which was neuer
in the power of man. Let
not Thales onely, that
Fauorite of Wiſdome,
but euen Wiſdome her
ſelfe, vndertake this task,
they can neuer performe

it. What ſhall wee doe
then? I can onely ſuccor
thee with two bucklers,
to repulſe and giue abatement
to the violence of
her charge. The firſt of
which is Innocence: the
other, Patience. Whoſoeuer
would avoid the bytings
of this miſchiefebreathing
Goddeſſe, let
him aboue any thing
arme himſelfe with Innocence:
and indeed they,
which liue in integritie
of life, warines of ſpeech,
modeſtie of actions, why
ſhould they fear her? For
as no filth doth eaſily adhere
to ſmooth & wel poliſhed

places: ſo, no abuſiue
ſpeeches can ſettle
thēſelues on vnblemiſht
deedes. This hath bin
oftentimes a good remedie:
I ſhouldly, if I ſhould
ſay alwaies. I know well
that Tully writes, as fire
caſt into water, is in an inſtant
extinguiſhed: ſo, a
falſe accuſation on a chaſt
life. I wold to God, thoſe
wordes were as true, as
wittie: for, how manie
men, euen of the pureſt
and moſt immaculate
conuerſation, haue beene
wounded by this Calumny,
and will euer be ſo!
How many haue beene

wounded, euen to the
letting-out of the beſt
blood, and iuice of their
reputation! Neither is it
any maruaile. For, Calumny
(as I ſaid before)
ſupports her ſelfe by Lying.
And ſhe may doe it
ſafely; becauſe ſhee hath
but one iudge: and that
one, ſuch, as (for the moſt
part) neuer enquires further;
but, belieues at
firſt. Wherefore, a certaine
flatterer of a King,
ſaw further into this
matter, than did the forenamed
Orator: who was
wont to ſay, that nothing
was to bee ſpoken againſt

any man: for, ſaid hee,
though the wound may be
healed, the ſcarre will
remain. A ſhrewd ſpeech:
but (belieue mee) very
wittie; and which takes
his originall, and credite
from our owne natures.
For, it is grafted in the
diſpoſitions of many
men, not onely to giue
open, but credulous eare,
to al whiſpering reports:
and the more willinglie,
if they treat of any wrōg
done, or to be done.
            Hee, whoſe chance it is
to be ſpotted, will hardly
waſh himſelfe cleane againe:
for, the ſuſpicion

will remaine, though the
crime doe not. And therfore
I did not vnwiſely,
to paint out Patience for
the buckler, wherewith
the innocent might defend
themſelues. The vſe
of Patience conſiſts in
bearing vneuitable Calumnies
courageouſly, &
with a high creſt. Varro
was wont to ſay of an ill
wife, That either a man
muſt endure her, or ridde
himſelfe of her. Do thou
the ſame heere; tolerating,
what cannot be taken-away.
What ſaid I?
thou ſhouldſt bear them?
nay, rather deſpiſe them.

As a courageous Souldier
ſcorns the weak darts,
that (like haile) make a
light ratling round about
his Helmet: So doth the
wiſe, and fortified man,
all ſcoffes, and deriſions.
For, what can they take
frō him? His good name?
That will euer be good,
amongſt good men. Can
they robbe him of his
Vertue & his Wiſedom?
Thoſe are no way ſubiect
to the will of man.
To conclude; when all
theſe carping detractours
haue ſpoke, and done
their vttermoſt, this man
of men (with a true and

lofty courage) cries-out,
All that is mine I carry
with mee. But, thou wilt
reply, that the meere colour
and appearance of
Infamie is to be feared.
If thou be guilty, feare it:
if not, why feareſt thou?
Apply it not to thy ſelfe;
and all is well. Diogenes,
the Cinicke (a man of a
towring wiſedome; who
therin not only exceeded
men, but almoſt equalled
euen the Gods themſelues)
was wont to ſay,
when the people mockt
him; They deride me: yet,
I am not derided. Do thou
the like: and ſo heare all

thoſe ſcoffes and ieſts,
broken (directly) vpon
thee, as if they had
aymed at ſome other.
Calumniatours neuer
lightly cōtemne or ſcorn
any man, that hath not
firſt contemn'd himſelfe.
Marcus Cato (that Roman
Socrates) hauing receiued
a blow from one,
and the party comming
afterwards to giue him
ſatisfaction, and to intreat
pardon▪ he ſent him
away only with this anſwere;
I aſſure thee, I remember
no ſuch matter.
O worthy man, beyond
other men! who thought

it a greater glory, not to
regard an iniurie, than to
pardon it. And, indeede,
if wee iudicially examine
them, how ſmal are thoſe
things, that do ſo much
trouble vs! For the moſt
part, no deeds at all; but
onely a fewe trifling
wordes, whoſe chiefeſt
ſtrength conſiſts altogether
in the interpretours
conſtruction. Refuſe
to vnderſtand them;
and, withall, the ſcoffer
hath loſt the whole purpoſe
and fruit of his contumely.
Theſe (gentle
Auditours) are the ſafeſt
weapons againſt Calumny:

not thoſe, which the
vulgar fight withall; Memory,
and Reuenge. As
in trauelling, if a dogge,
or horſe daſh mee, I am
nothing mov'd at him,
nor ſtriue to doe the like
to him; but rather, rubbe
it off: ſo ſhould wee doe
here; accounting of them
as of Curres, and Iades:
whoſe iniuries proceede
not from iudgement; but,
from froward paſsion
            But, here I ende; taking
down, and folding
together, the ſailes (as I
may ſay) of my Oration.
You haue heard three
things concerning this

Vice: the Filthineſſe of it;
the Miſchiefe; and the
Remedy againſt it. I beſeech
you, in the name
of the immortall God, to
baniſh farre from your
tongues, and eares, this
infectious plague. For, he
offends, not onely that
vtters Calumnies; but,
he that heares them with
approbation. And as it is
impoſsible to handle hot
iron, with out harme, and
danger: the like alſo befalls
vs, in giuing aſsiſtance
to theſe fierie
tongues. I knowe well,
they will inſinuate, and
fawne vpon you; making

a ſhevv of Ioue in their
countenance, & of mildneſſe
in their words: but,
belieue mee, they are
Aſpes, and Vipers; which
blowe-in their poyſon,
through ſoft and deceitfull
kiſſes. Theſe I
hold not worthy of admonition;
but rather, of
dire imprecation: and
therefore, I pray, with
DAVID; Confound the
lying lippes, O God, that
ſpeake againſt the
Righteous.
