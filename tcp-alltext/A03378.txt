            To the right worshipful
Mayster George Keabel Esquier,
Thomas Hil wisheth
all health and felicity.
            
               AFter I had increased
this treatise
of myne (ryghte
worshipful) and
waighing how ꝓfitable
this Arte
to be of the interpretatiō
of dreames,
in that the same sheweth to vs rather
comfortable warninge then anye vayne

                  •
               nd vnfruitefull matter. And that
none also but the vvise and discret parsons,
may rightlye discerne and Iudge
of Dreames, seeinge it is thoughte a rash
matter to Iudge of vnknowen matters,

                  〈◊〉
                those which a mā vnderstādeth not.
            Yet hovv Dreames may be knowen to

                  •
               m, whiche neuer had true dreame, in

                  •
               at they onelye happen to suche, whose
spirites are occupyed with no irrationall
imaginatiōs, nor ouercharged with the



burthē of meate or drinckes, or superfluous
humors, nor geuē to any other bodelie
pleasures. For those which are cōtrary
to this order, are not properly dreames,
but be named vain dreames, no true signifiers
of matters to come but rather shewers
of the present affections and desiers
of the body. And yet dreames seene by
graue & sober persons, do signifie matters
to come, and a spirite vndoubtedlie
shewinge to them, whiche by her nature
is a Prophetesse, that sēdeth forth such a
motion & workemanshippe, throughe
whiche the bodye as in her proper dwellyng,
may either be defended frō the instant
euiles & perils, or moued to the attayninge
of good things to come & that
with diligence workinge the same, that
as it were into loking Glasses of the body
placed, it might so beholde and foreshewe
al matters imminent. Therefore
this difference of true dreames from the
vayn ought diligently to be noted. Further
who that knoweth rightlye to iudge
these, vnderstādeth a great part of wisedom,
and they which iudge of the same,
haue a sure and perfite Arte. Besides Hippocrates



and Galen do wryte, howe that
the Phisitionnes by the Dreames of the
sicke) maye the redyar and aptlyar appoynt
a perfite diet and due medecines,
also for the recouery of the sicke: wherefore
I see not nowe that the rashe iudgement
of the ignorante, can rightlye condempne
the knowledge of this Arte, seing
the learned, yea & holy Scriptures,
do bothe allow and witnesse of Dreames.
As the same I maye heere aptlye applye
out of the Prophet Ioel. xi. where God
sayeth I will breathe downe of my spiry
               
                  ••
               on
all the earthe, so that youre sonnes
and daughters shall Prophesie and youre
olde mē dreame dreames, and your yong
men see visions. Also in sondry places of
the newe testamente wee reade howe that
the Apostles and other holy men, were
taught and warned by dreames. Besides
the learned Trogus wryteth, that Ioseph
the sonne of Iacob, first founde out this
laudable Arte of the interpretation of
dreames, althoughe Philo attribute the
this inuētiō vnto Abrahā his great grādfather.
And after him did the Godly Daniel
and wyse Salamō leaue in wrytinge



of this arte, as their Pamphlettes extant
at this day do manifestly shevv. But to
be briefe we learne that this art of the interpretatiō
of Dreames, doth especially
consiste of wysedome, and by cōiecture
in that he which coniectureth cunninglye,
is coūted a natural Prophet. So that
the interpreters of Dreames (as vvitnesseth
Quintiliā) are named coniecturers.
Yet for that ther be so few parsons that
see true Dreames, and fewer whiche vnderstande
or obserue them, yea and most
few vvhich can interpret them, therefore
of this, is the arte now come into a contempt
with most persōs. And although
                  •
               
I might here write sondry examples (for
confirmation of this art) bothe of kinges,

            The Preface
to the Reader.
            
               IF it be superstitious (gentle
Reader) and therefore denied
of some men, to haue a
foresyghte and iudgmente
in thinges to come, whye is
not then denyed to learned Phisitiōs, sklfull
warriours, weary husbandemen, and
polytycke Captains, to haue knowledge
in the Artes of diuination? If they be cō
               dempned
which bee of such antiquitye, so
generallye receyued, and so often confirmed
by the sundry workes of learned mē,
who then shall dare presume to open the
secreates of dreames, where in is contayned
so high, and so many mysteries. But
great pittyie were that so noble a knowledge,
so necessarye to all men bee trode
                  •
               
vnder fote, and so lightly estemed. At Artes
of forknowledge hath beene of long
                  •
               time
had in great price and estimatiō. I
tymes past the noble warriours, the graue
Senatours, the myghty Princes, & almost
euery priuat man, did direct al thei
                  •
               
doings, and wayghty affaires, by cōiectures
and diuinations.

southsayers or wyse men broughte them

mindes to inuent mo such studies, which

                  •
               s they increased in nombre, so were their
operations diuers, and their iudgements
seueral. Of the which numbre many may
worthely be cut of, some as most detestable
and wicked, some as vayne and friuolous
and many as meere foolishe, onlye
those are so reserued and excepted, wherin
any witte, wysedome, or reason is contained,
amonge this sorte, the diuination
by dreames dothe occupy as a Mistresse

                  〈◊〉
                of the chiefest roumes, for that in it besides
certayn & vnfallible rules, besydes
quicknes of wit, there must bee adioyned
dexterity in learning, grauity in debating
the matters & moderatiō in indgemēt wt
               out
the which neyther cā this art nor any
other be vsed in their right kindes, but al



erronious, no profit shall ryse to yt Dreamer,
no honestye to the deuinoure, nor no
praise to the arte it selfe. Let not the misvsage
of some mē, take awaye or deminish
the commēdatiō, that is incidēt to so
good an Art. Let not the rashnes of some
in lightly credityng euery ignorante and
vnlerned professours of the same, be a discredit
to that which in it selfe is groūded
on certaine and sure precepts, but rather
when suche errors doe happen, let vs returne
them on the parson, and not on the
Art. For if through the mysuage of some
men, good thinges should be condemned:
what Art so good should not be misliked
of? what doctrine so wholsome for the people,
so profitable for the common wealth
and so necessarye for mans vse, should not
be cleane banished Then should Phisicke
because vnder som mens handes, their pacientes
prosper not, be reiected. Law, for
that sometymes iudgment is giuē amisse
be abolished, and the vse of Surgery because
the Chirurgiā doth often kepe the
wounded in longer paynes then he nedes,
be cast out of a Common wealth. But as
these knowledges are neuer a whyt ye less



esteemed, thought the vnskilfulnes and
rashenes of the practisers, put oftētymes
the patients and clyents in great hasard,
peril and mischiefe, no more oughte thys
Act of diuination to be eschewed, whereby
daungers may be foreseene, and yet it
selfe voyde of all daunger & perill. What
haz
                  •
               rde of life: what losse of substaunce?
or what daūger of lim cā a dreame put ye
dreamer vnto? enē so much as whē he awaketh,
he wondereth how such imagination
or fancy crept into his minde. Be his
dreame neuer so terrible or fearefull, as
falling into the hāds of theues, werewoū
               ded
by thē, fightinge in bloudy battailes,
or on euerye syde beset wyth enemyes, in
suche maner as it would make a stout mā
to quake, yet when he awaketh no skinne
is brokē, he hath no ache in his bones, he
is stil in his quiet bedde, as whole and as
safe, as when he went to rest nothinge so
nor so, it was onlye a dreame. If now he
haue his knowledge of diuination, what
a cōfort wil it be to hym? that examining
the cyrcumstances in their due tyme & order,
shal prognosticate what such things
portende. And thereby may solace himself



with good happes, and labour to preuent
or hinder the imminent mysfortune,
or at the least arme hymselfe so stronglye
wyth patience as quietly to beare theim:
for a mischiefe knowne of before, and diligētly
loked for, is not so greuous as whē
it commeth on a sodayne. It is a wonderful
thing and almost incredible that dreames
should haue such vertu in them, were
it not that God hath reuealed it vnto vs:
When he himselfe, as a meane, often vsed
them, to open vnto his people of Israell,
his secrete wil and pleasure. Were it not
that we haue red of the wonderful chaū
               ces
in olde time foretolde by them: and
were it not agayn that we dayly se the effect
of dreames. But alas, our ignorance
maketh vs so blynde, that we know them
not, vntil they be paste. For a man beholdinge
in his sleape the toppe or ende of an
house fallinge downe, hearyng a dogge to
barke or houle, seeynge a hare to chase a
hound, or a byrd to flye withoute winges
will seeke no further, but esteeme it as a
vayne dreame, laughinge at his own conceate,
hauing more regard to the present
spectacle, then to the cyrcumstaunces to



come making no more accompte of them,
then of thinges casual, natural, or impossible.
For a house to fall doune is casuall,
a dogge to barcke naturall, the hare to
persecute the hound, is agaynst nature, &
a foule to flye withoute winges soundeth
impossible. Yet al these by cyrcumstances
signifie such euētes, as may be for the
profitte or hinderance of the dreamer. It
seemeth a thing against nature, & a thing
moste straunge for a woman to be deliuered
of a firebrande: yf Hecuba had lefte
here, and sought no further, then had she
not knowen howe her sonne Paris wyth
whō she then went, should be the destruction
of his owne countrye Troye. It is
monstrous for a Uyne to springe out of a
womans bowels, and for the Braunches
to couer or shadow the greate country of
Asia, yet this foreshewes Astiages, that
of his daughter should bee borne suche a
child, as should grow to a mighty Prince
and vnnaturallye should driue him out of
his kingdome.
            For a Cignet to hane feethers sone growen
out and flyinge into the element fil-filing



there the ayre with most sweet tunes

            The distinction of
Dreames.
            
               THe cause why Auerrois
dothe rather attribute
this passion
of Dreamyng to the
Imaginatiue parte,
is that lyke as the
motion of wakynge
beginneth from the outwarde senses, and
endeth at the memoratiue, euen so dothe
the motion of sleepe contrarye begynne
from this, and Endeth at the outwarde
motions. Wherefore seeyng the same

                  •

                  •
               he memoratiue, nor cogitatiue. For
that as hee wryteth, the woorkynge of

                  •
               hese, is not manifested in the sleepe, therefore
the same shalbe of the Imaginatiue
whiche onelye consisteth in the mouinge

               nd continual dooyng and maye also recyue

And of both the like, when as the

that when they happen trewe, the same
then dothe somwhat declare of that which
was in the hower of knowledge, and yet
this for the more part not present beyng,
for if this woulde happen in the presente
and instaunte doynge, that then the same
shoulde not forshewe thynges to come but
rather matters presente. In that al
                  •
               
thinges to come moue and woorke accordinge
to their causes. But how so euer
the same bee. yet Aristotle affirmeth, that
dreames may be caused by the sheadinge
of formes, whiche proceade frome those
thinges workinge in the acte. Yet hee perhappes
meaneth, that the same signification
of the dreame, is not caused in the
mouing of it. Wherefore howe soeuer be
doubted, that the vnderstandinge abstracted,
maye minister Imaginatiuelye the

that certaine are indiuiduates of the simple

of the particuler vnder that. In that



dreames for the more parte are caused of
those matters, whiche bee knowen to the
dreamer. And of this he concludeth that y•
knowledge of the imaginatiue, is rather
ended at the similitude or kynde of the indiuiduate,
then at the indiuiduate it selfe.
Because that if the same bee illuminated
by the vnderstandinge, then is that continually
procured to bee caused like it, with
the kynde whithe is more spirituall then
the indiuiduat. And a man also doth more
comprehend in his dreame then wakinge
in the daye tyme, because in a dreame i

is troubled throughe the doinges of the
outwarde senses. And hee concludeth also,
that a dreame is none other, then a
fantastical appearaunce, whiche the persone
sleapynge conceiueth. For if they are
of those affections which bee in vs, the
                  •

of anye matter wakinge and in the
day tyme, although that maye after happen
in the dreame, the same ensued not
altogether of the talke, in that not allwayes

be many of them paste whiche helpe
to the remembringe of those wroughte
in the day, and to the vnderstanding of the
others, and perhappes to giue warninge
of harmes that maye happen. And yet
these (after the mynde of Aristotle) doe
not of necessitye happen, because if anye
hathe dreamed to bee sicke, and hathe in
hym selfe the cause of a sicknesse, yet
may the sicknesse bee stayed by an other
stronger motion of nature. For that in
the ayre dooe often times appeare signes
of rayne, whiche after enseweth not, and
muche lyke to this dooe certen conclude
that there are such whiche before the execution
doo cha

               nge their determination
Also dreames are muche varied, whiche
do happen through the doynges wrought



before in the day tyme, in that not al are
sollicited nor delighted in those, nor the
vapoures doo moue in the same sexe, nor
the wayes of the common sence to the Imaginatiue
and memorie are caried the
lyke in one as in another nor there is not
the selfe same maner disposed in one time
as in an other. Also to sicke personnes
do some fearfull dreames happen, when
as the spirits cariynge the vertues of life
be aflicted by some euill vapour. And the
lyke when anye fearing is moued to crye
out, then is sicknesses prognosticated to
ensewe.
            But of the interpreter of dreames
bee ought to be suche a one wh
                  •
               che hathe
perfict knowledge to distinguish the simitude
of al matters and to be skilfull in the
manners and condicions of the moste people.
Besides it isirequisite that he bee a
personne whiche leadethe an honeste lyfe.
For although he may happelye touche euerye
kynde of cause, yette is the same
difficill to make apparaunte howe so euer
the same maye be reduced to the Acte.
            Whiche is the chiefe & principal purpose.
And further headde the of the



interpreter, that hee ought to bee a moste
arteficiall iudger, which well knoweth similitudes,
in that all dreams fall not out
right, for in this case euerye one maye easelye
indge those dreames as the same
happneth of the notes. For that lyke as
one beholding a farre of twoo sundrye
thynges of like distaunce, and the one of
theym hee well knoweth, then throughe
this be commeth the better and easelyer
vnto the vnderstandinge and knowledge
of the other. Also he ought to know how
to discusse from like to like. For like as
the poetes, which also are named naturall
prophetes, do further passe by a small similitude
of any matter vnto another lyke
as in speakyng of the nature of Venus do
thereby proceade to discusse the caulmnes
of the ayre, & so like in many others. Yet
that personne is apter to interprete dreames,
whiche otherwyse is not occupyed about
other matters. And that men sumtimes,
do dreame in the one they apply with
the other, so that ye one for the other, they
sometyme declare. And it is also written
of Hercules, that hee dreamed such dreames
at the first, whiche no persone coulde



expounde, but dreaminge afterwarde the
like was then declared to him, as it after
succeded. Also it behouethe the expounder
not to be ignorant, howe that the doinges
& busines of mē doe daylye alter through
the one, and throughe the other by the disposition
of the bloude and spirits. For
these when they bee many and cleare, doo
dispose the persone vnto mirth. And the
same is named a signe, because men beecome
sad beyng in the darke, vnto whiche
the humor verye subtill and distemperate
doth thē dispose them. For otherwyse
beynge cleare they dispose the personne to
beholde and see hydde matters. But the
subtile bumors ouer heated, doe dispose
the person vnto Ire, in that these bee engendred
of the burning and great heate of
the bloud, easely and apte to bee in
                  •
               amed.
            But the grosse and cleare, vnto sports
and the bodilye actes of myrth. And often
those personnes in whome theese are mul

               iplyed,

                  •
               nd yett as the common prouerbe, is that

                  •

the same somtime may be couered

                  〈◊〉
                vs. And the same also they declare by



the motion of theym. For when they bee
moued vehemently from the hart toward
the outwarde parte of the breaste, then
doo they cause Ire, and towarde the part
downewarde shamefastnes, but when the
mocion succedeth outwarde, then dothe it
cause ioye and myrthe. And throughe
the lacke also of them eyther in the quantitye
or qualitye are the sensitiue powers
forced to woorke eyther corruptly or dimynishedlye,
euen in the dreame, especialye
when the wayes and passages betwene
the Imaginatiue and Cogitatiue,
by whiche they passe, bee hiunred or trowbled,
for then the powers are often deceyued.
Also the disposition of bloude
throughe whoose subtiller parte the spyrites
are engendred, dooth alter the workings
both wakyng and a slepe. For whē
the bloude is cleare, not grosse nor subtyle
then doth it ingendre y• lyke spirites, whyche
dispose vnto ioye and myrthe, euē lyke
as the distempered, bloude woorketh vn,
to that kynd of Ice whiche longe lasteth,
& contrary wyse the thin & hot doth worke
vnto that which is sone kindled & sone qualifyed,
& the waterye, in contrarye maner



doth woorke vnto feare. But the grosse
bloude distempered in heat, doth worke

                  •
               sse of wil, sadnes, wherfore
it behoueth the expounder of dreams
to inquite orderlye, whether the dreame
appeared pleasaunt or otherwyse vnpleasante
for the knowledge of those dothe
geue greate vnderstandinge to hym. And
it shalbe necessarye for the interpretoure
to consider and knowe what the persone
tradeth or occupyeth, & of what birth hee
is & what possessiōs he hath & what state
he is in for the healthe of bodye & of what
age he is also which seeth y• dream. Also a
drea
                  •
               e ought exactly to be told as eyther
withoute anye addinge to of matter or takynge
fro, For yt these doo cause great error
vnto the vnderstanding of a truth.
Also if any shal doubt or be deceiued in yt
tellinge of his dream, then must the interpreter
nedes be deceyued, in the declaring
of the true meanynge thereof. And in all
dreames also which haue not a manifeste
cause, it behoueth diligenty to mark, whether
they be sene ether in ye night or day time
so yt we may not think to mak differēt
of the night afore, frō the daye, or ye night



euening from the morning spring, if so be

For that immoderate feedinge dothe not
permit matters to be trulye decerned vnto
the morninge.
            
               Of them which interprete dreames
by the colours of the Stars, &
by other accidentes.
               ANd nowe some affirminge the arte of
deuining by dreams, do teach yt things
whiche appeare in the proper nature dooe
forshe we good: like as dreaming to see the
earthe whiche of her nature is colde and
drye, and of this sheweth the dominion of
the Melancolie humor in that person.
And the lyke whereas they wryte, that
to see drye trees or cleft, doth after signify
perill of lyfe, which if that should be true,
thē many husbandmē and fellers of trees
shoulde die, because they often dreame of
suche businesses which they earnestlye go
about and busy them selues in. And in the
like sort this is not true, that to see in the
sleepe deformed thynges, that the same
foresheweth a sicknesse to come, neyther
is this also true, if that a thinge deformed
of nature doth then appeare farre to the



dreamer, that the farrenes doth forshewe
an euill, for that some do thinke to see artificial
garments should signifie a deceit,
in that vnder these is the truethe often couered.
Nor it disagreeth not that to se filthye
thynges in the sleepe, that the same
doth declare corrupt humors, because the
stincke maye proceeade of the outwarde
meanes or bee represented by the kyndes
reserued and then shoulde it rather argue
the goodnes of smelling. And althoughe
the body greeued, maye be sayde to argue
many humors, yet maye it declare that the
expulsiue matter is shed forth to the caryringe
downe of the groundes, or that the
sinewes or mouinge powers of the spirite
are hindered & stopped throughe some vapour
or humor greuing, wherof it faileth
not vnder the propre working that it may
be attributed to one cause, wt dependeth
of many. But well consideringe that the

                     •
                  ayre is the outward cause of dreames, because
in the first it receiueth the impressiō
of the starres, and after touchethe the bodies
of men and beastes, whiche are alt
                     •
                  
                  red
of it yea in the daye tyme, like as appearethe
in the nighte Rauen and Owle,



whiche (as moste men affirme) by his synginge
ouer the chamber of the sicke, is prognosticated
shortlye after deathe, because
as men say these, lyke as many other beastes
are more easelye chaunged in the respec
                     •
                  e
of men, for that those are not occupyed
with earnest cares, but that the ayre
in this case doth not onely touch outwardlye,
but by the passages or poores the
sence enterethe. And where that
others say, that to see in the sleepe cleare
and brighte formes doth signifie that the
bodies not to bee altered, this also is vntrue
because this maye happen, when the
melancholie humoure lyke to the sande,
doth purge & cause cleare visible spirites,
and then althoughe the clearenes of the
formes, doth declare the goodnes of these
sences, yet is the cause euill in it selfe, beecause
it declareth the dominion of that humour.
Nor it is to be doubted, when similytudes
appeare darklye, or shadowed
with cloudes, but that they maye declare
a troublinge of the visible spirites, and
when those tende vnto a witnes, then do
they signifye mattery humors, and when
the shadow appeareth smal, then doth the



harme soone ceasse, and when it sheweth
to the syght as water or earthe, then the
harme shal bee the greuousser, and the flower
apte to bee resoined. But wher
some affirme, when the sleeaper dreameth
to see starres shadowed with fyer or by a
thynne cloude, that the same doth argue
the dominion of choller, whiche rather
maye declare an indisposition of the eyes
eyther present or to come. And wher
they also afirme, that when the starres appeare
to the dreamer that they are so busted,
that they can not bee decerned of him,
that the same is a note of death, especially
if the personne then dreamynge the lyke
should be sicke as though the stars coulde
not then helpe hym. But this trulye
is rather a matter to bee laughed at, that
to prognosticate death of the impedimente
of fight. Yet certaine doo allowe when
the starres seame to the dreamer to moue
swiftlye, that thē they prognosticate great
Ire or madnes to ensew and that the inordinate
motions also of theym, to declare
sadnes and heauines to ensue. For the
selfe same doothe the inordinat motion of
any matter argewe. And graunte that



the order shoulde declare the goodnes of
the organe, yet rather dothe it expresse the
disposition of the powers of the sensitiue
spirit, or of naturall heat. Wherefore in
the like matters, are the other qualityes
and proporc
                     •
                  ions of thinges, referred to
the dreamer, considered.
            
            
               Certain demaundes and their answers
both of sleepe and of those matters,
through which, some time
we dreame
               ANd firste why olde men do not so well
sleepe, and dreame the lyke as yonge
men do seeinge they take more rest. Unto
which Auerrois thus answearethe, that
for so much as olde men are of coulde complexion,
althoughe they maye feede sufficiently,
yet haue they naturall heat ouer
weake in theim, so that they can not well
digeste the same and of this the fumes of
the meat in the stomacke are not sente vpwarde.
But the yong men haue naturall
heat intensed, through which they diggest
their meate wel, and of this send vp much
fume out of the stomacke vnto the braine
whiche cause theym so to dreame. Why is
it, when in the dreame appeareth some



fearefull matter. that then the personne
sweateth, and waketh vpō the same. Unto
which the philospher thus answereth,
that to the man appeareth then that terrible
matter to be present, aud wyth enemies
And nature also beyng careful of y•
health of man, doth both send forth heate
and spirites from the harte vnto the outward
members. So that nature iudgeth
it suche a ferefull matter, disagreeing to
the man, that throughe the concourse of
the spirites about the harte, the harte of
this is wrong together, and the mā therby
weakened of the same.
               Why men commonly are not wont to
dreame in the beginning of the night. To
which the Philosopher thus answereth,
that the firste digestion is then occupyed,
in whiche the sumes of the meate muche
ingrossed are sent vp, that mightely stop,
and so cause the persō that he cannot thē
dreame. And those also stop the passages,

To whiche is thus answered, that as the

and to more reason, then the others
in the night tyme. To which the philosopher
answeereth that in the morning the
midle deuision betweene y• common sēce
and the Organe reseruatiue is sufficient
quiet, throughe whiche the fumes of the
meat eleuated then, are sufficiente weake,

                  y whiche the formes are troubled, the



similitude then of the matter which was
seene doth represente the acte of seeynge,
and heard, the act of hearyng, by whiche
they were caused.
               Why is yt that the vertuous men and
studiouse, haue often plesaunter dreames
then the wicked and vicious persons. T

and of this the kyndes of the good woorkes

wicked woorkes, the kyndnesse of thos
                     •
                  
euill are reserued, throughe whiche they
often dreame, wicked dreames.
               Whye is it that suche wakened out
                     •
                  
of sleepe, be myndefull of their dreames,
and not of the woorkes doone in their slepe.
To whiche the Philosopher thus
aunswereth, for that whether the form
                     •
                  
of the dreame remayninge imprynted i
                     •
                  
the Immaginatiue parte, or for that the
woorkinge of theym was caused by the
Organes shutte of theym selues, an
                     •
                  


                  
dissolued by accidente. Therfore the simylitudes
of the matters caused, coulde
not bee differred or caried vnto the common
sence or ymmagination, in that the
particulers wear bounde. Yet are they
sometymes stirred vppe and moued forwarde,
for that vnto a stronge motion in
the Orgaue, the sence maye ensewe the
motions of the mouing spyrites
               And a stronge motion I mean, in that
this maye heate and resolue the moisture
stoppinge the commone sence. Nor it is
not necessarye, that for that tyme they
shoulde be depryued by a voluntarye motion
in that althoughe the senses maye
bee harmed throughe the distemperatenes
and diminution of the spirites, yet
is not in that season the sence of fantasye
taken away, whiche is onely cause of
the same.
               Whye is it that persones hoate by nature
or eatynge hoate meates and vaporouse,
do dreame muche. The reasone
of this is for that verye muche hoate vapoure
doothe sharpen the spyrites whiche
placed in the Motion doe mooue
forwarde the kyndes restinge in the memory,



so that the dreame is caused of the
representing of them. And Aristotle wryteth,
that throughe the boathe humours,
dreames are caused of matters a longe time
reserued, for althoughe these maye abyde
in the Organs▪ quieter, yet through
a strong motion of heate brought backe,
may so cause dreames, or to dreame after.
Why appeareth it to the mā dreaminge
that the dreame is somtymes true, and
somtyme aunsweareth not the lyke at al.
The cause of this is, in that it some tyms
happeneth that in such a dreame the iudgement
or knowledge of the vertu intellectiue
cōcurreth with a sensitiue vertue
but sometimes the same doth not concur:
therefore when it doth concur, the man
iudgeth the dreame to bee false & the reason
is in that the intellectiue vertue doth
correcte the sensityue. But when it doth
not concurre or accorde then doth it appear
to the man that the dreame is trew.
Why is it that certayne sleapynge doo
exercise the workes of persones waking.
The reason is, for that not simplye they
doo slepe, nor properly bee wakinge althoughe
the vapour in the tyme of sleape



dooth stoppe the Organe of the common
sence, and repelleth the heate and spyrits
toward the harte. Yet sometymes wyth
that vapoure dothe some pe
                     •
                  mixte kynde
of be he mente concupiscence, or feare. or
boldenesse remayne. For this when it moueth
the onely Organe of fealyng in this
beginninge, yf then from that kynd 
                     •
                  f his
fantasie also is moued seeynge it is the
beginninge of the locall motion, therefore
sleapynge it is moued by it selfe, and
when the foresayde causes bee base and
weake, that is to saye, not mouing out of
the place, and when they be stronge, then
doo they moue from place to place. And
because the spirites and Organe are distinct
sences from the Organes, the motions
therfore of them are for the more-parte
not reasoned of, but seynge they be
not muche distaunt, for that cause is not
speache hyndered in them, so that the Organes
be not occupyed or indisposed, for
then doo they shewe foolishenes muche
lyke vnto the condition of the sicke. And
because the lower mēbers whiche be the
instrumentes of motion are lesse hindred
in respecte of the vpper whiche obeye to



the sence therfore those are lowsed vnto
the motion, and not vnto the sence, and
because the qualitye of the eyes is of the
natu
                     •
                  e of water, therefore are they slower
opened to see abrode then the other
members to moue. But althoughe suche
walke wyth the eyes shutte, and that rather
by a happe, yet sometymes by Fortune
or by Custome they come vnto the
place in the daye tyme immagined, not
by sighte in that the eyes are then shutte
but of the inward fantasie by which they
walke in the darke, like as in the lighte
or daye tyme or rather this by a happe.
And although they bee then without feelynge,
yet the other senses do obaye in as
muche as they may to the mouinge powers.
But sometymes they think to kill a mā,
and sometymes that they theym selues
are deade, because the fantasye doothe yagine
that whiche eyther it conueytethe
or feareth.
               Whye is it that suche hauinge bygge
heades be louers of sleepe. The reason is
for that they easelye receiue and retayne
the vaporous fumes of theym, also the



moister braynes are apter to slepe, whose
neare workinge is a vapoure wythoute
doubte. Why is it that wyne doth sometymes
cause sleepe, and sometymes to
wake. The reason is for that when it
is druncke moderatly, it doth then cause
sleepe, in that the vapoures of the wyne
doo not trouble but easelye moysten and
stoppe the wayes by whiche the spyrites
and heare passe whereas wakynge, it doethe
otherwyse. But when the person
drinketh muche, or y• the wyne is strong,
then dooth it dulle and vexe the powers,
and instrumentes of the spyryt, whiche
at that tyme placed in the motion, dooe
force the persone to wake. And although
               Nature troubled sometymes, these
doe cause astonishement, yet do they not
then perfitelye sleepe.
               Whye is sleepe caused moore and longer,
by lyinge on the righte syde then on
the lefte. The reasone is, for that as
Aristotle wrytethe, wee doo more wake
lyinge on the righte syde, yet sleepe is
caused of the contrarye causes. Or for
that the ryghte syde is more wearied in

                     〈◊〉
                   daye tyme, whiche of these neede the



the more reste, nor vppon this syde also,
doth the harte labour.
               Why is it that onely man whyles hee
sleapeth, boweth downe in his sleapyng.
The reason is, for that the powers and
spirites gyuing sense and motion drawen
inwarde, doo not then suffer the bodye to
be stayed vpright or for that the vprightnes
of the fourm in man may cause of the
same that the foresayde powers and heat
by their owne nature may bee caried vpwarde
or determined by the proper kynde
yet by drawinge downe those from the
members, it behoueth that they fal as to
the heades of beastes, of their owne nature
goo not vpright. And for that the ascending
of those in the beasts is not so easely
caused, therfore the members in thē
seeyng they remayn not altogether destitute
of helpes, they staye vp themselues
the surer and better.
               Why doo beastes sleape a lesser time
then they do wake. The reason is, for
yt the superfluityes multiplyed by perfect
digestion can not aptlye bee sente of nature
without the body by one onely expulsion.
And, seeing we may often ryse to put



away those, therfore is sleape oftentymes
broken. Or rather for that the greater
part of the woorkings necessary to life, &
in whiche mans perfection consisteth, is
perfourmed in the daye tyme, and not in
sleape, in whiche man differethe not from
plantes or beastes, and whom nature findeth
vnto the ende of waking, for that we
sleape quieter, & wake with more delight.
               Why do mē affirme, that sleape much
helpeth to digestion. The reason is, for
that the same happenethe not to euerye
thinge, but rather in that whiche is caused
for the comfort of the whole body, as
of the stomack and liuer, vpon which the
powers and heate more vnited dooe conuerte
themselues, and be shorter lynes
for they bee in a manner in the midle of
the creature. But to the other particuler
members is the foode digested sence, and
if that lacketh anye thinge then the heate
ingendred suffiseth them, which may as
wel be caused in the day time as in sleepe.
               Why do some wryte that the marishe
or watery places cause sleape. The reasō
is, for that from these are vapours ingrossinge
and coelynge the ayre caused, which



breathed in or drawen in wyth the breath
that spirites refuse, as contrarye to Nature
it selfe whiche is cleare and pure, so
that throughe the drawinge in of these,
sleepe enseweth. Or rather for that the
grosse ayre brethed or entered in by the
pores of the body, dooth by his grossenes
greeue at the firste the brayne, and after
carried vnto the common sence, dooth of
the same compell sometimes to sleepe.
               Whye doo the tellinge or hearinge of
tales sometymes cause, and sometymes
put away sleepe. The reason is as yt
is sayde that in some parsones the grosse
moisture aboundeth, which if it so happeneth
that through laboure in the hearing
it is resolued into a vapour, then are they
taken with slepe or rather moued to slepe
but the humour subtile in leane or chollericke
persons, do moore sharpen, and of
this in the prickinge compell the person
rather to wake: Why affyrmeth the phylosopher,
that sleeping he thinketh some
tymes or through a small noyse to heare
thunder, or through a litle fleume sweet
stillinge to the tongue doothe then thinke
to taste or eat milke, and so lyke in many



others. The reason of these ys, that as
they saye by nighte, the outwarde sences
bounde in the respecte of the motions frō
without do perceyue the inwarde far bigger,
whereof the common sence or other
vertue dreamynge is deceyued, in that he
iudgeth those to be of other sensible matters,
then in dede they be. And Aristotle
wryteth that the small motiones in
sleepe do appere bigger thē in the day tyme,
because the sences in this occupyed about
many matters, eyther perceyue not
those, or els discern thē far lesser. And for
that hee thinketh those sometymes to be
rather as honnye then mylke, happeneth
eyther throughe the indisposition of the
spyrites or lyfe of the dreamer or of an other
cause, so that of particuler matters,
no firme rule can bee geuen.
               Or when the same should happen that
Nature expelled from anye principall
member anye moysture lyke as 
                     ••
                  ewme
in purpose as vnto taste, or wyndye Humour
as vnto hearyng, and if now by reason
of the firste that which sheddeth forth
vnto the Organe of taste is smalle in respect,
yet the sences whiche perceiued and



dooe retayne the cause of the former motion
to haue bene bigge in his beginning
or parhappes with a bigge and strong enforcement
of nature expelled, therfore the
imaginatiue couetynge to expresse y• troublesomnes
which it perceyueth as bigge
doth so moue other customed formes to
represente inwarde tastes, as of Mylke.
               And the selfe same iudgmente is of the
small noyse in respecte of hearyng, which
throughe the foresayd causes thinkethe ye
same bygge, and so mouethe the kynde of
thunder otherwyse ment or thought before.
               And why do some wryte, that such deuisinge
or vnknowen matters, doo often
falla sleape. The reason is, for that the
dayly beholdinge of matters, doth hinder
the disgestion of nourishment, but vndygested,
the humours then do easely, euaporate
vp to the head & cause the dreame
to appeare otherwyse, Then as they vnderstande
and be delighted, Because the
diligente marking, and considerynge of
the matter, doothe then cause the parson
to wake. And of this when any readeth
not vnderstandinge the matter, hee therevppon



dothe often tymes fall a sleepe.
               Because the spirites & power through
the indeuoure and agitation weakened
doo retourne inwarde, that they maye
reste, after whiche ensewethe sleepe, rather
through y• laboure, whiche also doth
often conuerte the humour into a vapour
               Why do the sicke and dronken parsons
geue somtymes in their sleape angry and
frowarde woordes and sometyms gentle
& honest wordes. The reason of this is for
that the spyrites vexed by an euill or obscure
humoure do then cause feare after
whiche then ensuethe hatred, that so forceth
the persō to speake frowardlye especiallye
beynge a babler by nature. But
when the spirites be cleared, then do they
dispose that person vnto a hope, and so to
talke quietlye and gentlye
               Why is it that certaine beastes sleepe
wythe the eyes oppen, lyke as the Hare
and fyshes. The reason is, for that the
fyshes do lacke eye liddes, whiche verye
nature hath denyed theym, in that they
lightlye waked maye sone succor and defend
them selues. And the hare when she
is pursued or hunted after doothe at no



tyme hyde her selfe▪ in the wood amonge
bushes, leaste her eyes alwayes open and
vncouered, myghte so bee harmed wythe
bryers and thornes.
               Why is it, that the remembraunce of
the euil past, doth not take awaye sleepe,
lyke as otherwyse of matters to come.
The reason is, for if the same shoulde bee
true and bothe laborious, yet of that to
come by reason of the feare annexed, is
the same wythe carefulnes. soo that thys
letteth him to slepe, whereas of the knowen,
it troubleth hym litle or nothing at
all. Why do some sometymes declare to
see or to haue seene in their slepe Deuils,
and somtimes saints or Angels. The reason
is, for that althoughe deuils of their
propper nature haue no coloure at all,
yet because by this especialye as bye the
black, they are manifested to the people,
therefore whan it so happeneth that
the adust humoure or fume doth occupye
the spirites and and passages, then the cogitatyue
ruled by thē, doth cause the dreamers
to belene y• y• similitudes or black
kyndes to be very diuils in that they are
then caused corruptlye to decerne. And al



though there can not bee caused one only
dreame of all the kyndes whiche are reserued
in the remembraūce, yet are there
ymagined many diuills, in that they are
comprehended vnder a certayne vnicye
of blackenes imagined. And euen lyke,
when the foresayd similitudes and ways
are affected wythe the redde couloure of
bloudde mixed wythe flewme whiche for
that the same is white and the other redd
therfore through, the worthines of the colours,
they think thē those to be ether Angels
or saints in yt both these wer wōt to
bee so painted. And that y• bloud also doth
dispose the sicke to gladnes, appeareth in
the swan, whiche drawinge nere to death
singeth, because her subtil bloude is then
dispersed in the ventricles of the harte.
Yet sometymes those bee trewe deuilles,
whiche shewe themselues sodeinlye, beefore
the soule departethe out of the mans
bodye vnto a greater payne, or rather
parhappes that God will, that suche call
to remembraunce their wicked dedes, and
that the sick in conscience may therof repente,
and amend before death.
            
            
               
               Of the opinions of phisitions
iu dreames.
               THe phisicions also dooe obserue, that
dreames in a maner doo declare y• disposicion
of our bodies, as eyther to helth
or sicknes, whiche parhappes oughte rather
to bee searched out and learned by
Arte. Yet say they, that when sleapynge
men see blacke visiones, lyke as the drye
earthe obscure or deade men, these they
and such like, do forshewe customed sickenesses
to be caused of the melancholy humoure,
and they also warne vs then to
consider whether that visione towched
the whole body in that the sickenes foloweth
vniuersall, lyke as of the agewe or
leaprye, for if in any part alone the partyculer
shalbee & that it hath nothinge touched
that it signifyeth vppon the indisposition
of the spyrites, throughe whiche
some sadnes is wonte to happen in the
spirite and the selfe same they declare of
the bloud For when it doth offende in the
lyke or in asmuche, then doth he thinke to
see redde and ayeryal matters, and what
soeuer is pleasaunte to beholde so that a



hote and moist qualitye is prognosticated
vppon the motion or indisposition of the
same, and then doth it in lyke sorte either
touche the whole body, or but parte, And
the lyke is to be sayde of choller, when as
it semeth to hym to see cytrene or fyerye
matters, or contentions. And the
flewme in lyke sorte, when as it seemeth
to him to see the whyte, watrye, glasse,
or clammye, and other lyke proportioned
matters to that humoure, wyth the foresayde
consideration. And allthoughe
these maye perhappes yelde to the place
of the signes yet by them may not the bodely
or inwarde nor premitiue causes bee
founde, oute of these, as by the same appeareth.
in that they do depend of the gouermente
of the sixe naturall thinges by
which they be knowne without the dreames,
and of the first also, in that seldome
when wee doo dreame, wee dooe then see
those touched, excepte, that when they do
foreshew the harde expressions or properly
the nightmare by whiche are wonte to
bee prognosticated the sicknes named Apoplexiae.
And many also of these which
as they say do cōmonly happen to health



full parsons, withoute sicknes folowing
Neither do the sayings declare the cause
for somuche as it is manifest that the subtill
vapour of bloude, or flewme euer heated
by laboure or sicknes may cause dreames
to shew of choller, wt in dede beareth
not sway in the body, or els is sone resolued
or fumeth away.
               But if you demaund why they do foreshewe
choller, when as a man in sleepe
feareth to fall, or thinketh to haue fallē?
               The reason is, for that when the same
is subtill and of a swift motion, doth then
in dispose the spirites. and letteth the motiue
spirites to proporcionate the space betwene
the bounde, from whiche, and vnto
whiche. But the falling either is a discō
                  tinuation,
or not without these, for that
wakinge a man dothe not onelye fal, but
throwe himselfe headlong downe, which
regardeth not to discende by the ordinarye
steppes.
               Also other phisicions do reduce mens
dreames, vnto the inward or bodily cause
but these rather do happen of the effectes
or cares of the spirite begon in the daye
tyme, and they are besydes diuers in diuers



persones, because, not al personnes
occupyed aboute the same, lyke as y• occupyer
& idle person, the smith, or hus
                     •
                  andman,
whereof the selfe same forme dothe
shewe one thinge to one person as to the
couetouse man, an other thinge to the lyberal
person, or Musician, another thing
to the healthfull, & an other thinge to the
sick. Wherfore if it should be so graūted,
that the phisition by the argument of the
humour rulyng may argu the temperatnes
or distēperatenes of nature, and vnto
the more whiche eyther trouble or helpe,
but these contrary of beastes in y• by time
do diuers desires aryse of which cā no firme
or certayne rule bee giuē but are wōt
as it is said to be aplied vnto those which
eyther we are by nature, or custome, or
by immoderat desire inclined but if those
shoulde haue an outewarde cause, then
might they signifye many matters vpon
the yssue of the busines of ye hap to come,
but the signe of this is, as whē dreaming
he remayneth after wandringe & amased
because the significations thē do not lack
which also may be applied to the hauing
inward cause of humours. But the cause



of the admiration, is either proceedinge
through the newe accesse of the outwarde
kynde because they happen not customably,
or els when the humour ouer muche
ruleth or excedeth in the bodye.
            
            
               Of the cause of Dreames.
               THe causes of all dreames bee on this
wyse, firste those whiche are caused
of meates and drinckes, as in surfeytes
are wont to be is the cause of the mocion
whiche properlye is caused of the vapoures
breathing out of the fo
                     •
                  e. But
the sleepe is the reste of the spyrites, and
the wakinge, the vehemente motione of
theym▪ and the vayne dreame is a certayne
tremblinge and vnperfit motion of
theym. Therfore al are vayne dreames
caused through the spirites lightlye moued.
Wherof whyles we soundly sleepe,
we then dreame nothinge at all.
               So that all kyndes of vayne dreames in
this point, do agree wyth the light motiō
of ye spirites, & all do agree in the matter,
for y• the matter of ach is the remembraūce
of y• sene or heard, for no vain dreames



are caused, but through them. As y•
lyke for example, when a man in his slepe
thinketh to se a monster with thre heads,
which hee either hearde of by the discription
of some or sawe paynted in the lyke
sorte, whiche heades he remembred to be
on this wyse, as the one lyke a Lyon, the
other a serpente or Dragon & the other
a Goat. That if anye other straunge
matter also a man shall see in his sleepe,
or some vnknowen thinge, or deformed
Plant then are those none other then vnparfite
thinges or transposed.
               For an vnknowen man is none other,
then when a man is vnparfitlye founde.
               And the knowledge of this is, that all
men, yea the moste knowen beeyng seene
far of, are vnknowen. Therfore through
the vnperfite knowledge and trāsposing,
and mixinge of sightes, are all dreames
caused. So that it appeareth that al dreames
to agre booth in the efficiente cause
and in the matter, for the efficyente cause,
is the moderate motion of the spirites,
but the matter is the memorye of things
seene, eyther whole or vnparfit.
For as it is manifest that there be diuers



kyndes of dreames, euen so it behoueth
y• the causes bee diuers for that throughe
them, those are alwais caused.
               This moderate motion oughte not alwayes
to be thoughte so perfit, that this
moderation is exquisitely an indiuiduat.
               But if the mocion be vehementer, and
troublesomer, althoughe it maye bee moderated
in the kynde, yet are they called
vayne dreames, troubled, vnperfite, and
confused. And in this maner doo twoo
kyndes of them, aryse, the one whiche is
of meate, and is the more confused and vnperfyte,
yet more fayntly.
For that from the meate and drinke the
vapours are not soo parfytelye caried as
from the humours, whiche so cause dreames
more vnperfite & lame, yea and more
obscure, in that the vapour is fatter, if the
parson drinketh wyne, then of humours
               Yet are the kyndes not so stable, doe.
moue wyth suche a force, as those whiche
are caused by the humors. Wherfore the
dreames caused of meate are lesse parfyte
lesse agreeynge, and in order, so that they
appeare more troubled, confused and diuers,
then those whiche are caused of the



humors, as are contrary, those which are
caused of the humors be more stable in order
& agreeing, yet lesser troubled and diuers,
& with lesse force, then those which
are caused of meate. And those which
are caused wyth a lesser troublinge, and
bee clearer, but caused as they were compounde
throughe many remembraunces
conioyned, do affecte more by the sleepe
through that, whiche agreeth that by wakyng
in the day time litle. Also they agre
for the more parte to those thinges eyther
seen, or harde, or imagined the day before
or but a fewe dayes before, or els a longe
tyme before. And thē do they shew y• order
as it were of the whole matter. But
those whiche are in an order, and bee
wythe the leaste motyon of the spyrites
caused gentle, and that without anye agitacion
of the vpper causes procured,
doe yet more affecte the soule, that wakynge
bee maye then bee holden wythe
a certayne admiration. And seeynge a
man may throughe the effectes, proceede
vnto ech causes therfore oughte a traūce
to be ineche kyndes.
               For if dreames by a greate mocion



maye appeare troubled, dyuers obscure,
and vnperfite, and that they seeme a litle
to agree then shall wee s
                     •
                  ye, that eyther
meate, or drincke, or suche lyke matter,
was the causer of these.
            
            
               Of the deuision of Dreames and order
of interpretyng of thē
               
               IT muste needes ensue, that some causes
of effecte, to bee true of all dreames
& of the others whiche are caused, & therfore
those causes, are eyther bodilye, or
not bodilye, and hoth also eyther newe, or
before wrought. So that it must uedes
ensew, that ther be foure kyndes of dreames.
Now the new and bodelye causes,
are meate and drincke, lyke as the heades
of Garlike, the Coleworts, the
Onyones, the Beanes, and what soeuer
ascend to the head, and especiallye those
whiche engender melancholye. Further
yealowe choller doothe cause to appeare
in sleepe, bothe fyers & fightynge,
and Melancholye causethe to appeare in
sleepe claye, myer, or dirte, Burialles,
graues, imprisonmente, and feare, and



bloude causethe to appeare spor
                     •
                  es, fayre
places, bloude and purple coloure: and
the flewme causethe to appeare waters,
showers of rayne and snowe, for that the
same is a moyste colde qualitye. But
the vncorporate causes precedent are cares
cogitations, matter as committed to
memorye, feare, hope, gladnes, heauines
or sadnes of mynde hatred and loue. But
the new are those whiche frame the superior
cause come vnto the soule. For of all
the other members al the causes of the diuisions
doo so agree that many endeuour
to place this laste vnder some of the three
foresayd. And it behoueth first 
                     •
                  o seke
out whiche may be of euery kynde, & therfore
whiche true and which false, for that
none do shewe matters to come, but those
whiche are sente frome the superioure
cause, and those also whiche are caused of
humours. And hereof why those maye
bee true it behouethe to shewe, and what
truth also may be found in al the kindes.
               And after that which bee formes, that
maye bee interpreted. And to
co
                     •
                  clude the whole tretise as it euidentelye
appeareth doothe eyther consiste of



the difference of thinges seene, or of the
maner of seeynge, or difference of the
dreaminges. For that by nature men
see true dreames, whiche dreame but seldome,
and false dreames whiche dayelye
dreame. Also suche as be occupyed
in greate actions, and businesses, and
greately abstayne from meate and drinke
nor are troubled wyth feare nor sadnes,
doo see and haue true dreames, but suche
affected in the contrary manner, doo see
false dreames. And for that cause the
dreames of Princes, are commonlie true.
               And suche of honeste manners trewe
faythfull, and godlye, haue for the more
parte trewe dreames. And suche
whiche are not so godlye, but cruell, yet
no deceiuers, see commonlye trewe dreames,
and the supersticious parsons, do see
very fewe true dreames.
Also he whiche is accustomed to see true
dreames, to his dreames is more credyte
to bee giuen, then to those whiche are of
a contrary manner. And men haue
truer dreames in the Sommer and the
Wynter then in the Springe, and the
Harueste, for that in those tymes they



often alter. Also quiet seasons, dooe
cause true dreames, but the wynde, and
boystrouse weather, dooe worke contrarye,
and the more boysterouse, the rather
falser. Besydes shorte dreames
and in order, are truer and moore euydente,
and of a cause more constante are
caused. And dreames moued or cansed
in the rysinge of the Sonne, and, before
or after vnto the thirde hower, bee
for the more parte trewe. But those
dreames at the noone tyme of the daye
and at the settynge of the Sonne, bee
not so true. For that the sonne is the authour
of the true and constante thinges.
So that when he shalbe nere the angels,
be doth then cause the truer dreames.
And the terrour or feare of thinges mouynge
a man oute of bedde do often follow
true as the lyke happened to Caesar,
the daye before he was slayne. And the cō
                  dition
also whiche is fullfylled by and by
of the slepe, when it shalbe without cogitation
doth the reason shewe trewe and
most certaine dreames.



be much before, or after the rysing of the
Sunne, it shall then signifye the cause to
deginne, or els shal then be accomplished
or discouered. Therefore that space shalbee
referred vnto the whole dreame, as
vnto the whole yeare.
And nowe as to the qualityes of thinges
seene, it is manifest that whatsoeuer are
presentlye begone, are sp
                     •
                  dylier accomplished,
yea and that verye swiftlye those
which presently through y• proper course
are neare the ende, but those contrarye,
do slowly ensue. So that a man must cō
                  sider
the nature of the dreamer, the age,
and the reste needfull, lyke as the wealthye
persons, and men in aucthority. And
whosoeuer also haue a constitute tyme, as
Magistrates for a yeare, lyke as the selfe
samh custome is vsed in London, by the
yearely chosinge of the Mayre. And to be
briefe, the tymes of dreames are either
presente or shortly after, or a longe tyme
after to come or paste, or els a tyme appointed
for that no man can number the
yeares, monethes, nor dayes, exept that
when the words or peculiar signes declaringe
the nombers shall come.



And besides these, whatsoeuer dreames
shalbe caused in the Kalendes of Januarye,
or on Christmas daye, come to passe
wythin a yeare after. And if in the Kalē
                  des
of any moneth, or in the entrance of y•
Sonne into anye signe then within a moneth.
And if in the same day of the Sunnes
enteraunce, eyther into the Solstice
or Equinoctiall, then shall the effecte ensue
within three monethes. And if in the
houre of the full Moone or Chaunge, thē
within xv. dayes after. And if at the Sunrysinge
on the Sondaye, then within seuen
dayes after. And if at the new enterance
of an office of gouernmente, or enterance
of a newe house, or of the newe
dwellinge in an other countrey, or newe
enteringe of a shippe, or in any other beginninge
to speake generally before the
ende of that bus
                     •••
                  sse, shall the effecte be
accomplished.
               Also dreames happeninge on Christmas
day, and on the day of the salutation
of the virgin Marye, shewe maruelous
matters to follow, & do also extend their
good happes vnto the returne of the next
yeare. And the daye of yt resurrection, for



that the same is a mouable feast doth, signify
the lyke, yet chaunginge the forme
of thinges, as that the parson shall passe
out of one condicion of lyfe into an other,
or els it declareth that mutation to come
in the same yere. And that no new happe
besydes of encrease, for the present lyfe,
is after promised of the same. And seeyng
in all matters, some one may be better &
worse, and whiche profiteth and harmeth
euen so must it happen in the lyke wherefore
whatsoeuer do remoue impedimentes
do cause dreames the truer, for some
impediments are of the mynde, others of
the bodye, and others whiche hinder and
trouble dreames. For the dreames art
troubled of these, which declare dreames
of an other kinde, like as meates
and wyne, and the veneral
acte excessiuely vsed, and
troubles of y• mind &
sorrow of which a
mā must beware

               AND to eschewe the
longe, circumstances
and prolizites of cerayne,
and that the
readers of these may
not bee wearied aboute
so dyuers, as
vayne practices which be written and declared
by many, about the interpretation
of Dreames. Therefore wee will follow
and vse a surer and easyer way, into these
whiche shall bringe with it some wonted
reason of others happeninge to come by
the which maner many haue bene inuented.
For manye truelye wyth these, cō
               ceyue
to direct of the particuler doinges
in the day tyme: For how much y• kindes
moued & altered be in the cause of remembraunce,
and oftentymes also wyth
similitudes perceyued in the sleepe or rather
wyth the experience of them whiche
after followed, we saw to declare much.
And many also whē they see or perceiue,



that it hath otherwyse happened or, come
to passe, then as it is wonte oftentymes to
them, to succeade and followe as to some
good. And contrariwyse, when it so meeteth,
that it hath otherwyse hurted, then
they be striken with a feate, which is the
expectation of the euill, And semblably,

and apply like, and the dreamer also
hathe experienced to haue otherwyse
come to passe then it moueth againe the
similitudes or formes of those matters,
which in the lyke, or in some haue happened,
wyth the which prosperous dreames
hee caused. And contrarywyse when hee
is myndfull that it hurted, then hee prouoketh

               tyer
shall not hinder, as the Philosophe sayth,



which is, that oftentymes present
signes of rayue be at hand which succede
nor fall not after. So that not al thinges
are to be sought out by the causes. For it
is truly as Aristotle sayth, that the learned
to earnestlye enquire and searche out
that which commeth to passe or perfourmed
in euery kynde, and how muche the
nature of that matter worketh, and geeueth
also a similitude, whiche appeareth
by the Mathemathicane perswading to
proue by the orator to demonstrate.
            Wherefore those are not to be denyed,
which by a long tyme haue bene obserued
and founde true, forasmuche as in their
kynde they be neare to the termes of the
first principles. And if therfore deuining
by this arte, a man sometymes may be deceiued,
it is noo maruayle, because that
no man hitherto hath affirmed that assuritye,
that of dreames he may haue suche
certayntye which he hath of the sciences
and others, which we worke wakyng in
the day time in the which also errour happeneth.
For both the Gramarian, doth
sometymes harberouslye wryte and the
Phisition also harmeth in his cures.

               ANd they witnesse to this opynion,
whiche the auncietne menne did obserue,

them, for when as they saw and marked
a certaine animall lyke to flye to go oute
of certeyn appels, they pronosticated thē
battaile to ensue takynge paraduenture

forasmuche as flyes be in continuall motion,
and moue or stirre too and fro, and
be also of a deceytfull and importunate
nature, like as to mē of warre. Also they
pronounced rayne to ensue, of the eger

                  ation
of the vapoure one high they lacked
the fode, wyth the which before they
were nourished, whereof they recurre to
hard matters which when they sucke, by
a greater inforcemente and myght, they
thenne byte. But those beastes which
cannot sucke or byte, lyke as be frogges,
and such lyke, the which do sing or chirpe
that they maye the better drawe the ayre

otherwyse bee nourished and liue. And others

to come oute of the earthe, pronosticated
plentye of corne to ensue, for asmuche as
the whitenesse of them proceded not but
of the fatnesse of the earth. And others
also markinge litle spyders to go oute of
certayne fruetes, did pronoūce pestilence
to ensue, & paraduenture the reason was
because the spider is an animal of the nature
of Saturne, whiche oftentymes is y•
cause of the death of beasts, or els because
shee spinnethe or weauethe her webbes
which be in a manner like to that matter
in whiche the dead bodyes to bee buried
is inuolued. And further by y• similitude
of a Serpent they pronounced a secret

               Of those Dreamess whiche were
reported to haue bene

                  COnsideringe there is no
other credite to be geuen
to dreames, farther than
theyr nature requireth,
yet being requested or rather
enforced by my frē
                  des.
I will therefor recyte certayne of
those which we haue taken & knowen as
true. For although that many of them for
the most part & especially those whiche
be caused by an outwarde maner, the reason



or cause of them cannot be assigned or

altered in colour, and substaunce, albeit
it maye declare the euil disposition of the
eyes, either presente or to come, yet if the

argueth very whot humours. And when
the coloure is diuers and variable, argueth
the diuersity of the humours and that
spyrites troubled & disquieted much, and
outwarde sorrowes also. For these geue

hand wyth other matters. But whē
these impedimentes cease althoughe the
man thinketh not on them, yet the former
similitude commethe agayne, and representeth
it selfe cōfusedly, because it made
not an impression before.
               
                  
Wherefore when it is feareful he sorroweth,
and the cause knoweth not, but the
same maye happen of some inwarde humour
which before rested, and after vexeth
by it selfe, or by a vapoure or fume.
But to come to the matter, whenne wee
dreame that we see the water troubled &
muche in quantity and permanent, declareth
the aboundance of many humoures.
If it appeareth that it runneth: sygnifyeth
the caterre to come or presente. He
whiche dreameth that he seeth missing &
light rayne and the firmament cleare argeweth
a good disposition of the spirites,
with a litle humiditye of the eyes: but
the firmament to bee cloudye and bent to
rayne, signifyeth the aboūdance of these,
and the indisposition of them. And when
to the sicke person in a feuer appeareth y•
he swimmeth in the water, is then anotyce
that nature contendeth againste the
matter of the sicknesse, and that the paciente
shal escape because the resistence and
fight argueth the strength of him.
And when one dreameth that be feeleth
himselfe much greeued as he wer pressed
or wronge together in the bodye, is a notyce



of benummynge or the nyghte mare
as wee name it. For it demonstrateth or
declareth the quality wherewyth the sleaper
is vexed, rather then anye outward
thinge.
               To dreame that he seeth himselfe caryed
as though he flyed, declareth the subtilnes
of humours, like as to dreame that
he seeth or toucheth snowe or hayle declareth
crude and raw flewme.
               And dreames signifye euill, when the
spirites and heate renewed in the sleepe
transpose them vpon those euill humors,
whiche before rested, for asmuch as then
through these the lyke vapours be eleuated
and stirred vppe, and these by their
ill nature, cause men to feare. And vniuersallye
all thinges seene or appearynge
in the sleape otherwyse t
                     •
                  en their proper
nature, do argue an indisposition or dystemperaunce
of the powers or spirites,
of the organes, or humours, or of naturall
heat. Lyke as dreaminge to walke
by narrow places, declarethe a sicknesse
to come of the lunges or lightes, because
he is prohibited and letted to breathe or
drawe necessarye or congruente ayre, and



the reason wherfore is, because their passages
and wayes be stopped. And 
                     •
                  ccordinge
to this sence, it is sayde that Physitions
commonly helpe by dreames.
               To dreame that he seeth menye Citizenes
aud Townes men gathered in the
Churche, well apparelled, wyth mearye
countenaunce and smylinge cheare: it is
founde by experience, that hee 
                     〈◊〉
                  
happye mariage to bee with good sucke
in the ende, if he myndeth the taking of a
wyfe. And otherwyse when they appeare
sadde of countenaunce, yrefull or yll fa
                  
                     •
                  oured,
then if that hee that so 
                     〈◊〉
                  
be sicke, it declareth as hath bene experienced
the deathe of the dreamer neare at
hande, especiallye when they that are of
his affinitye seeme to associate or companye
from others: for it disagreeth not, y•
one similitude wyth diuers cyrcūstances
and respectes maye signyfie manye thinges,
lyke as somtime for the lacke of wordes,
and signifieth many thinges, yet the
worde or name is for y• more part at pleasure
of the namer, but the thing it selfe is
of nature. And in all dremes the more
good cyrcūstances there are like as whē


                  
they seeme to be in a pleasāt, fayre, good
lye, greene, and fruit
                     •
                  fu
                     ••
                  place, or in a
Churche, or before 
                     •
                   frende, and so of the
others, so muche the certainer shalbe the
interpretation vpon, prosperitye, and contrarye
wyse vppon infortūnacye: lyke as
to dreame that he seeth himselfe in a barren
place, desert, or rude, or rough wyth
stone, or troublesom, pronosticateth euill.
And when also he who dreameth is fortunate
alreadye, althoughe the prosperouse
vision may haue fewer testimonyes, yet
by reason of his owne fortune, the signification
is enlarged in prosperytie & goodnesse:
and when one being infortunate already
soo dreamethe, then wyth fewer testimonyes
may be pronounced vpon the euill
end. And generallye to say when the
vision appeareth in the proper syte & due
place, not defourmed nor troubled, not

                     •
                  loked, dissembled, nor coūterfeyted, argewetth
goodnes of the operacions: and
tēperatnes of humoures. But here must
be made a distinc
                     •
                  ion, because with them
is associated somewhat appertayning to
affayres or busynesses but wyth these to
the natures of the elemētes or mixtures.



For when one dreamynge thinketh that
he seethe or heerethe clearly and quickly
declarethe the clerenes of the animall or
visible spyrites.
               And to dream that he runneth swiftly
allthoughe it signifyeth that the powers
of oure mouinges bee tree and well, yet
maye it also pronounce the expedicion of
some busines.
               To dreame that he meeteth women in
blacke garmentes, wyth their heade couered
declareth priuy deceytes intended
against him as hathe beene founde true,
whiche thinge booth the kynde of them &
also the coloure of the garments perswadeth
so to be.
To dreame that hee seeyth a harlotte, or
commoneth wyth hee, signifieth deception
or variances, which amonge y• others
be two propertyes of them.
               To dreame that he smiteth or killeth
an enemye wyth the sworde, is a signe 
                     •
                  
token of victorye to ensue, as hath been
                     •
                  
experienced, and if hee were in sute wyt
                     •
                  
him, yt declareth that hee shall haue th
                     •
                  
sentence pronounced on his behalfe, o
                     •
                  
on his syde,
               
                  
To dreame that hee seethe a fryende, or
prieste of an honest and godly lyfe lokyng
chearefull in countinaunce, declareth a
good happe to follow, for the people vse
not to hurte vs, when we are awake, but
to dreame that he hath, foule or pityfull
face, signifyeth heuines of mynde
               To dream that he seeth a man accustomed
to, lye declareth that it shall contrarywyse
happen in his businesse, then
he hoped and loked for. But the contrary
is signified in seeynge him that vseth to
speake true. To dreame that he seeth
hymselfe put or thruste into prison, declareth
as hathe bene proued, that the busines
of whiche he is vexed aboute, shall
sone be ended by agrement or by sentence
or the cause shall remayne and 
                     •
                  reste as
boyde and dead, for imprisonmentes bee
the extremity and vttermost in ciuil controuersies.
To dream that hee seethe the
Judge or Justice his face, altered in coulour
or place, declareth that hee wyll not
perfourme that whiche he promised, for
the countenaunce, in latyne is named
Vultus, because what a man willethe it
expresseth and declareth. To dreame that



hee seeth a Prince long a gone dead, with
a mery countenaunce or lokynge merely,
signifyeth a vaine hope to follow,
               To dreame that he talketh wyth a dead
parson, whiche hee thinketh to be a lyue,
signifyeth that some deception or wylie
deceyt shalbee opened or manifested, vnto
hym. To dreame that he seeth a fielde or
close of greene wheate, wyth eares not
spronge oute, declareth ioy wythout profite,
or very small, because the profite of
the wheate consisteth in the eare. To
dreame that hee seeth the ayre (whyche
for the obscurytye and darknes thereof)
he can not discerne, declareth that some
wicked facte by him committed, shal remayne
vncouered and vnknowen.
               If he, whiche is in loue with a woman,
dreameth to haue founde abirdes neaste,
and that he reaching or puttyng his hand
into the neast, feeleth it could, it is a tokē
of hasty or sodayne sadnes, and sorrowe,
for she shal either marry to another man,
or els shall dye, & he shall departe sone frō
that citye or abydyng place, into another
town. For yt neast signified & is in ye place
of byrth, and coldnes expresseth death.
               
                  
And to dreame or thinke that he hath
sounde yonge ones there it declareth ioye
of wantonnes or luxurye, & to take those
byrdes, signifyeth a certayne gayne.
               To dreame that he seeth a smal shyppe
entringe into his house and after goynge
out of his house, declareth the deathe of
the principall or heade of the house, especiallye
when to hym apeareth that in the
house is water, for that betokenethe the
teares and the shippe signifyeth the beare
whereon the dead bodyes be caryed.
               And manye thynges are spoken of the
seing of sundry beastes, as to dreame that
he seeth many horses, declareth a hope of
gayne to follow, but if they walke confusedly,
declareth the disquietnes and trouble
of mynde. If he thinketh himselfe to
ryde vppon a fatte horse and beautyfull▪ &
in a pleasaunte place, declareth gayne, wt
out controuersy. If the horse be redde it
shall be wyth stryfe and variaunce, and if
cole black, with heauines of minde, and if
whyte vncertayne. To dreame that hee

                  e asses, or wylde beastes, that
lyue in woodes, declareth labors wythe

                     •
                  eauines of mynd. And lea

                  fat and white, gladnes and gaine of the
proper industrye aud if they be vnder an
others care or kepyng, it shal come by an
outwarde maner: And if they feede in a
pleasaunt place it declareth aboundance
and quietnes of mind, and if they be in cō
                  tinuall

person, if it weare a venemous Serpent

that byt, hee shoulde be endamaged by a
prince, if by a wolse, by a secrete enemye.
               To dreame that he tatchethe fatt byrdes,
signifieth gayne, but to heare birdes
chatteringe which cannot be caught, signifyeth
contention, and if they lyghtlye

declareth assured gayne. If he whiche
loueth a woman, should dreame that hee
speaketh in a straunge tongue, declareth
that in fewe dayes after, he shall speake
and commune with her in secrete, or els
by letters. To dreame that hee gooeth
vp to a ch
                     •
                  yre and in it declare doubts,
arguethe that it shall sone bee reputed as
true whiche he shal openlye speake in the
face of the people. To dreame that hee
seeth himselfe clothed wyth a garmente
whiche extendethe nor passethe the midle
of the legge, declareth the expedition of a

done & ended wtoute his shame or checke.
To dreame that the fruite whiche hee gathreth,
sauoureth sweete and pleasauntly
declareth a good dispositiō of the humour

that hee shall soone after be infamed

that he is in the pallace of a kynge or byshoppe
and that his face appeareth cherefull,
and in the accustomed haby

               To dream that he seeth those thinges,



which be wont to lye hid vnder the earth
as bones, or carcasses of the dead, or mō
                  strous

shall succede straungenes and troubles,
because they be contrary to the course of
nature, and they be also as diuinations

               To dreame that hee hathe eaten vnaccustomed

                     •
                  ng out of his brest,
and after commeth to one to haue them
plucked awaye as vnseemelye to him



there to growe: declarethe that hee shall
haue two men chyldren, and through an
euill calamitye and myshappe, shall bee
slayne, and theues also shall besette hys
house and breake thereinto, and besydes
spoyle his houses or barnes standinge in
the fieldes. For the eares of corne signifye
the men chyldren that shall come &
proceade of his seede, and the pluckinge
away of the eares, declareth the occation
of the chyldren and the robbery of hys
goodes. When a pore man hauing a rich
father, dreamethe that hee seethe his fathers
head plucked vp by a Lyon and to
be deade, declareth as it is verye lykely
that his father shall dye, and he left to be
his beyre and by this mean hee shall put
away careful

shall ouer charge or lay hym noe moore
nor be pressed by pouerty. For the heade,
signifyeth the father and the plucking or
drawing awaye the priuation or deathe
of the father, the Lyon, the sicknesse, by
whiche the father sickninge shall dye of.
And the death the exchaunge and alteracion
of lyfe & that through the falling &



comming of riches to hym, he shal neuer
be poore and nedie after. To dreame that
he hath no feete, or no soles of feete, declarethe
that hee shalbee burned. And a
woman to dreame that her eyes bee soredeclareth
that her children shalbee sicke
after. And to dreame also that her children
be sicke, declareth that her eyes shabe
sore and greueous.
               If the mayster of a shippe dreameth
that hee hathe loste the fore parte of the
shippe, declareth that shortlye after his

               And if one dreame that he seeth his father

And one to dreame that he hath no nose,
declareth that through a false cryme and
naughty deede done, 
                     •
                  e shall flye, and forsake
his proper countrye. For the lacke
of any member, or parte of the face, maketh
it lothsome to see to.
               And who that dreameth that he drinketh



softe or thynne mustarde, shall after as
hath bene experienced be accused of murder,
for y• no man is accustomed to drinke
mustarde, but of force, seeynge that it is
no customable drink to be druncke, and it
is rather to be sayde of that whiche commonly
is sayde, that is, who euer drank
mustarde. And therefore it may bee sayde
that it is contrary to the nature of drink,
as vyolent death, is to the nature of mā.
               And if one dreame that hee lightethe a
candell at the moone, shal in shorte tyme
after fall or become blynde, as hath bene
founde true. And the reason is, for that
he semeth to take light there, where it
is in possible to take. And besydes the
Moone, as it is sayde hath no light of her
owne lyght.
               A certayne woman there was, whoe
dreamed that she sawe three proper ymages
or formes in the Moone and was delyuered
of three women children, whiche
dyed in the same moneth also, that they
were borne. For those three images signifyed
the doughters, whiche one circle
compassed and contayned. For that in
one thynne skinne named a seconde, the



phisitions say the infants and yonglinges
to bee contayned in the mothers wombe.
               And they liued no longer because the
Moone perfourmeth her course in a monethes
space. A certaine ryche woman
dreamed that shee saw three rauens come
and sit on her, and that dishonestly to behoulde
her besydes the one of theym to
say wyth a hoarce voyce, I will take 
                     •
                  hy
lyfe from the and after these rauens had
flowen thrise aboute her, they departed
away. The whiche woman the nynthe
daye followinge dyed, ryghtlye and by
good reasone. For wher he sayd I will
take thy lyfe from the, was lyke as if he
had sayde I wil depriue the of thy lyfe,
that is I will kyll thee. And that they
flewe thrise aboute her, didde signifye the
nyne dayes followinge
               A certeyn woman dreamed, that shee
saw her selfe to haue done Hercules laborues,
who not longe after beyng hastely
or sodaynly taken wyth fyre, so ended
myserablye her lyfe,
               And one dreamed that hee sawe his face
in the moone: who not long after traueiled
into farre countreys and ther continued



a longe tyme foorth in wandringe
about those regions, for the continuall &
swyft mocion of the mone, declared that
hee shoulde lyke wander here and there
aboute.
               A certayne man there was, who dreamed
that bee thoughte hymselfe to haue
an yron yarde: which not longe after had
a chylde by whom he was slayne for that
yron by rust, which groweth on the same
is so wasted awaye.
               And one dreamed that he wente from
home into a straunge countrey, and loste
the keye of his house, and when hee came
home agayne, he founde his daughter to
haue lost her maidēhead. Which dreame
declared to hym that al thinges at home
coulde not be in safetie, when the kaye so
loste was ready for another to take vppe,
for eyther it signifyed as it is thoughte
the misusage of his familye, or ells that
hys wyfe, daughters, or maydens, were
entyced to follye in his house, or elles otherwyse
that his seruauntes brybed and
pylfred away from hym.
               And one dreamed y• he thought he rose
wythe the Sonne, and ranne also wythe



the moone: who after was strangled, &
so booth the Sonne and the Moone arysinge
saw him hanginge on highe for hee
had the Sonne in y• morninge in his face
and the Moone in his backe at nighte soo
that he had the one good morrow and the
other good night.
               A certayne man there was, who dreamed
that he thought his seruaunt whom
he loued aboute all others, was tourned
and become a Fyer brande whiche afterterwarde
fell blynde, and by his seruaunt
he was ledde so that in this maner in his
seruaunte was a lighte to him, to shewe
hym the way.
               And one dreamed that he thought hee
sawe a starrefall from heauen: and another
starre to ascende from the earth vnto
heauen. Who then was a seruaunte
but after his mayster dyed. After whose
death, he thoughte hee had bene free and
wythoute a mayster, but in the ende hee
founde that hee was compelled to serue
hys tyme wyth his mysters' sonne. So
that the Starre fallynge signifyed the
deathe of his master, and the starre ascendinge
vppe, signifyed the sonne to bee



his mayster, vnder whom hee shoulde
serue. And one dreamed that he thought
hee crepte out of his owne fleshe lyke as
the serpente beynge 
                     •
                  u
                     •
                  de, doth caste his
slough, whiche person the next day followinge,
dyed For the soule myndinge or
rather beynge forced to leaue the bodye,
gaue to him suche ymaginations, and to
dreame the lyke. And one dreamed beyng
in a straunge countrey, that he was
borne again of his mother, who after returned
from thence into his own country
and founde his mother greeuouslye sicke,
& he after succeded as heyre to her.
               And this was signifyed to bee borne agayne
of his mother that is to saye, from
pouertye to become riche by his mother
for in greate nede and pouertye hee was
before. And one dreamed y• he thought
his bearde to burne in a lighte and clear
fyre, without smoake: who had a sonne
which after was in greate estimatiō & honoured
for his knowledge. And yet they
liued not longe together but that by a certayne
incommoditye and mishappe were
seperated, and dwelt or liued a sunder.
So that the bearde burninge, signifyed y•


                  
sonne to become excellente and had in reputation:
for the sonne was an ornament
of the fathers, like as the beard to y• face.
But because fyer is wont to deminish &
wast euery matter therfore it signifyed
that the sone not to abyde or dwell with
the father: And the sonne also was seperated
frō hym, and not dyed, because the
fyre burned cleare without smoke.
               A certayne man dreamed that he hearde
one say to hym, thy staffe is broken, who
after fell sicke, and was brought to a palseye.
For fyrmenes of the bodye is declared
by the staff that is to say the strength
and good health therof. And the same
man being long vexed and troubled with
the palsey, thoughte in his dreame that
his staffe was broken, who very shortlye
after recouered his health. For it declared
that to hym beyng so sicke neaded not
an outwarde stay or staffe: a
                     •
                  d that he also
shoulde recouer his bealt, so y• he shold
not after neade a staffe to walke wi
                     •
                  h.
               And one dreamed that hee thought hee
woulde haue turned the head to loke on
his shoulder, and could not: who not lōg
after became blinde of the one eye, so that



he could neuer after see that shoulder on
the same syde that the eye was.
               And one dreamed that he thought hee
was caryed on a blacke Oxe, and that y•
Oxe bare him whether he woulde or no
                     •
                  ,
as to do him some other harm. Who not
longe after toke a iourneye by Sea, and
was in great peril of lyfe and not manye
dayes after the shippe brake & the shipp
so perishing, he could hardlye scape with
life. And one dreamed that thoughte be
saw a darte fall from Heauen, whiche
wounded one of his fee
                     •
                  e who after was
bitten of a Serpente, and the byte so rotted
& wasted his foote that hee died thereof.
And one thought in his sleepe, to haue
a Barbours glasse, & to stande with the
same in the streate neare to the markette
place and there to occupye hymselfe as
muche as he myght with the glasse, and
after possessinge the glasse after his mind
did therein behold hymselfe, and sawe al
his Image filled wyth spottes, who thē
loued a concubyne, and without good wil
and agremente of frendes, did after mary
her, by whom hee had a dishonest child
not onely for the facte, but for y• the child



had croked and ill shapen eyes. So that
the Barbers glasse signifyed a common
woman, who lightly was alured to any
personne, to vse her bodye wickedly, and
for that letted by frendes so muche as in
them lay, to mary her. And where hee
sawe his Image, signifyed his sone after
borne, lyke to hymselfe in all partes, yet
irreprehēsible, for that the glasse had spottes.
               And one thought in his sleape, that he

                  at he should hyde the facte.
               And one dreamed, that he thought hee



caryed a greate substaunce of bright gold
on his shoulders, whoe after fell blynde
throughe the brightnesse of gold▪ for as
it is very lyke a trueth, that golde darckned
his sight.
               And a certayne man dreamed, that he
thought he hard one say to him, feare not
death, albeit thou canst not liue. Who after
lost his sight, and this ryghtlye hapeninge
to hym by reason. And he dyed not
insomuch as he liued still, and yet agayne
he liued not, insomuch as he had loste the
comforte of the lyght, that is, he saw not
               And one dreamed that he thought hee
eate breade dipped in honnye, whoe after
attayned vnto suche eloquence and wisedome
by the studye of Philosophye, that
hee gotte therby muche riches: For the
honnye signifyed the obtaynynge of eloquence
and wysedome, as very lyke it is▪
and the bread the great ryches which he
got. A certaine woman dreamed, that
she thought she had her husbandes priuityes
cut from the reste of the bodye in he
                     •
                  
handes and that she toke great care, an

muche foresight howe to kepe them: wh
                     •

she brought vp her selfe. For the husbandes
priuityes, signifyed the sonne whiche
was gotte by hym: and that it was taken
or cutte away from the rest of the bodye,
signifyed her brynginge vp of her sonne,
but her husbande was after bereft of life
by death.
               A certayne mā dreamed, that he thought
he saw an Oliue tree spri
                     •
                  ge out of hys
heade: Who after followed earnestly the
studies of Philosophye, and vsed consequently
the doctrine and exercise thereof.
For the plante or tree is thought alwaye
greene and lustye in it selfe, & thereof dedicated
to Minerua: whiche is fayned to
be the Lady or goddesse of wysdome.
               And on dreamed that hee thought hee
fleeyd of the skin of his owne sonne, and
to make a bagge thereof, to carye wyne
or suchlike matter therein. Whose sonne
the next daye followinge fell into a riuer
and was drowned. For they make bagges
with the skinnes drawen of dead flesh
or carcases, in the which they are wont to
put wynes, oyles, and other lyke licours.
               And one dreamed, that he thought he
sawe his louer in an earthen pitcher, or



potte or suche lyke vessel burning: whose
louer after was dead, and slayne of a cō
                  mō
or hyred seruaūte at will. For it signifyed
with good cause death to the woman
because shee was seene in an earthen vessell:
and of a common seruaunte because
it was also a cōmon pitcher or potte, serio
                     •

               And a certayne man dreamed that hee
thought he dwelt oute of his owne countrye,
and ther builded an hearth for fyer:
Who not longe after dyed out of his country
where he thought he builded or made
the hearth. For it signifieth ye place wher
the fyer dissolueth & wasteth to noughte:
& the buildinge of it oute of his countrey,
signifyed there the ende of his lyfe.
               And one dreamed, that hee thoughte
dwellinge out of his proper countrye, to
build an hearth and for the stones he mo
                     •

                  red
his owne bookes and then playstred
together: but after changinge his mynd▪
he threw downe that he had built, and s
                     •
                  
                  ceased
of buildynge. Who not long after
fell sicke, aud was vexed with a greuous
sicknes, which sicknesse so handled hym,
that he was brought to deathes dore, bu
                     •
                  


                  
in the end he recouered to health agayne
               And the manifeste causes of these, be superfluous
to recyte.
               And a certayne man dreamed, that he
thought he was persecuted of a woman,
whiche he had knowen of a longe tyme
whiche did putte on clokes to knit about
hym, and that loose hanged in the middle
withoute pleates or seames: & that at the
last agaynst his will, compelled thereto.
After whiche a woman louinge this man
did mary hym agaynst his will, and hee
wythin fewe yeares after dyed, for that y•
clokes were vnparfit and not sewed together,
it so signifyed. And a certayne womā
beynge sicke, dreamed y• she thought
she was with child, & that shortly after to
labour of her child, & to be neare the time
of her deliuerye: but further she thought
that a certayne woman vnexperte aboute
these matters to touche her and to saye:
that now truly she shall not be deliuered
but after .7.monethes she shalbe deliuered
of a fayre childe & amiable, or worthy
to be loued who after fel into a dāgerous
sicknes y• no man thoughte her to escape
and liue, and yet the sicknesse leauinge



her nothinge at all whereby shee shoulde
come to healthe, died within seuen monethes
after. For by good reasone, it
was the discharge of the burthen and cares
after the seuen monethes: but the
fayre childe, was or signifieth deth, which
was worthier to be beloued and chosen afore
the rest, because he taketh awaye the
sicknesses and sorrowes, or cares of thys
lyfe.
               And a certayne man dreamed, that he
thought he threw out his ringe, wyth the
whiche he sealed all thinges, and after
seking it, found that the stone which was
in it cleft in two small partes or peeces, y•
it co
                     •
                  lde not after serue to any purpose
whereof ensued that al his busines auayled
not, or came to no purpose, for fiue &
siftye dayes after.
               And a certayne man dreamed, hauing
a riche sister and being also sicke, that before
the sisters dore was a figge tre sprōg
vp, and that he plucked of the tree seuen
black figges, and eate them: which sister
after died, and left hym as heyre whiche
so dreamed, within seuen dayes after, and
the reason of these be euident.
               
                  
And a certayn woman dreamed: that she
thought shee had an eye in her ryght pap
or brest: who had a sonne that shee dearelye
loued, which not longe after lost, she
muche wayled for. Whiche reason may
lyke be applyed to that when a persone at
anye time dreameth to haue an eye in his
shoulder, that loste the shoulder: for in a
certayne manner is sayde by the dreame,
regarde the shoulder, aud haue concideration
thereof: So that by the same reason
the woman lost not her brest but the like
to the breast, her sonne.
               And a certayne man dreamed that hee
thought he eate his owne dounge wythe
bread, and to be delighted therwith: who
after was made a ruler, besydes the law
amittyng, and that without blame: for yt
it semed to him to be delighted with that
banket and yet not wythout suspi
                     •
                  ion, because
of the dounge. For ve
                     •
                  y like it was
that this gayne to be full of filthines, and
dishonestlye.
               And a certayne man thought, beynge
sent into a straunge countrye on message,
that in his dream he was returned home
agayne: and that his wyfe after standing



by him to saye the litle sweetynge is dead
Who not long after receyued letters frō
hys wyfe, that the yongest childe hee had
was dead, which was a swete childe, &
to be disyred and loued of euery bodye.
               And a certayne man dreamed, hauinge
a brother dwelling in a straunge country
that it was tolde hym y• his brother was
come home & that he thought his brother
sawe hym become blynde: who after died
which saw the dreame. And by good reason
it was, for asmuche as it was impossible
that the brother should see him being
so farr of.
               And a certayne man dreamed that he
thought he fedde his priuy membre with
bread and cheese like as it wear a certaine
beast, who after died shamefullye. For ye
meate which he shold haue offered to the
mouth, he did giue to the priuye membre
as it were darckly signifying and in a figure,
that he should haue neither mou
                     •
                  h
nor face. And a certayne womā dreamed
that she thought, that out of her breaste
sprange eares of wheate, and that the eares
after brast open into her nature to be
drowned agayne. Whiche woman after



by a certaine happe vnknowledge to her,
did coeate with her owne sonne, and after
slewe her selfe, and so 
                     •
                  yed vnhappelye.
               For the eares signifyed the sonne, and the
drowninge of them into her nature signifyed
the coeatynge. But the death of her
signifyed the seedes sprong out of her bodye:
because that out of the earthe, and
not out of liuinge bodyes they spring vp.
               And one thought in his dreame, to fynd
in his iacket or cote very many and great
stinking wormes & to abhorre them: and
that also woulde shake them of, but could
not. Who the next day following learned
or vnderstoode, that his wyfe had her
accustomed felowship carnaliye wyth an
other man & vnderstandinge the same became
very pensiue and perplexed of mind,
in somuche that be would haue departed
from her, but did not because hee was
otherwyse prohibited, or stayed by a certayne
lette. For the iackette or coote signifyed
the wyfe gyrte or wrapped aboute
hym and the stinkinge woormes her pollution.
And where as hee coulde not
pluck and cast them away at his wil: signifyed
y• he coulde neither after his desire



and purpose, departe from his wyfe.
               And one thought in his dreame, that
he had a mouth in his foundamente, and
great and fayre teeth, and to speake by it,
and to eate meate, and whatsoeuer also
are wont to be done by the mouthe, it to
haue al like: who after through his light
and foolishe talke, 
                     •
                  ledde his countrye, &
was banished for a longe tyme after. For
very lyke and to reason were the happes
but the causes be here omitted.
               And a certayne man dwellinge in Rome,
thoughte in his dreame, that hee flewe about
the Citye & neare the toppes of the
houses, and to reioyce in the sucesse of his
flyinge, and to be maruayled at wyth al ye
lokers on, but by a certain payne and bytynge
or gnawing of the harte, hee was
forced to cease from flying, and for shame
sake to hyde hymselfe: Who after was a
marueylous man, excelente, and a noble
or famous Prophet, & dwelling in Rome
got together much riches, insomuch that
hee was greatlye maruayled at of all the
people, but in the ende, hee receiued no
profite, neyther of his coniecturynge, nor
ryches, for his wyfe betraying, and deceiuing



hym, turned al to the contrary part
towardes hym, so that he coulde not for
shame but departe the Citye, and dwell
in some other place.
               And one thought in his dreame, that
preparynge hymselfe and readye to flye,
he was stayed of a certayne frende of his,
and holden by the right foote, & the name
also of his frende was Iulius. Which mā
after was readye to departe from Rome,
and to dwel in another place, and had prepared
also all those necessaryes, which be
required for a departure or mouing. But
it happened that in the present moneth of
Iulye hee was stayed and made to abyde
throughe a certayne incommoditye and
mishappe that fell that time. And that caryinge
or abydyng endured not to the end
of his lyfe, because he was frend, of whō
he was stayed and holden of.
               And one thought in his sleepe, that
he was entered into a schole in his owne
countreye, and that hee sawe his Image
there hanginge within. And that further
beholdynge, thought 
                     •
                  e sawe that all the
outward edge or bordour of the Image
was loused, and afer thoughte hee asked



one what had happened vnto the Image,
and thought also he sayde thus vnto him,
my Image remaynethe whole, but the
border is louse. Who after became lame
of both feete & that by good reason: For
that the schole was a note of the good habitude
of y• whole house. But the Image
signifyed those thinges, which are about
the face: and the outward bou
                     •
                  der, weer
the outwarde members of the bodye.
               And one thought in his sleepe, that his
bolster or Bedd ticke, was stuffed wythe
wheate in the stede of floxe. Who then
had a wyfe which neuer before bare child
and the same yeare conceuinge, broughte
forth a māchild, For the bolster orbedde
signifyed the conception of the woman,
and the wheat a man childe,
               And on thought in his dreame, that he
was accused of certaine iniuries, and that
to haue lost the wrytings & hookes of his
iustification, who the next day hauing the
matter in rehersal was then cleared of al
accions, & this was y• whiche the dreame
signifyeth to hym. That is to say, the artians
being remited, he needed not afterward
his bookes of iustifycation.
               And one thoughte in is sleeape, hauing



two maydens to his daughters, that the
elder had on her heade a golden Garlād,
and the yonger a Garlan

                  yne
braunches greene spronge. Nowe the elder
of these two was shortlye after marryed,
and the other dyed. For the beutyfull
Garland, was a note both of the cō
                  ceyuing
of chyldren, and of maryage, and
the preciousnes also of the matter, signyfyed
the ioye in mariage. But the Garland
of the vine tre, was a note of deathe
imminēt to the other daughter, because
it grewe out of the earth for that bodyes
put into the earth are after resolued. And
for that the vyne also is the longest seasō
without fruite. And one dreamed hauing
thre sonnes, y• two of them cutte him into
peeces and eate hym and that the yonger
knowinge of the matter waxed sadde and
disdayned them & refusinge also y• sh
                     •
                  meful
matter, sayde, I wil not eate of my father.
After which it hppened that his yō
                  ger
soune dyed: for it signifyed by not eatyng
of the father, that he should not possesse
of the fathers goodes, & he also died
before the father. But the other two
whiche semed to eate hym did after death
enioy his goodes.
               
                  
And one thought in his sleepe, that a man
toke awaye his sister from his father by
force, and martyed her vnto another man.
Woo after dyed, that sawe the dreame:
for the father did rightlye signifye God, y•
Authoure of lyfe to the dreamer, And the
sister by the lyke reason signified yt soule,
and taken away by force of the man, signifyeth
that seperation of the soule, from
the bodie.
               And a certayn great wrastler thought
in his sleape to ve greate with chylde, and
after to be deliuered of two blacke womē
children, Who after became blynde, and
the balles of his eyes shedde forth & were
after blacke.
               And a certaine woman thought in her
sleape, that her mayde had gotten frome
her both her owne Image which she caused
to be painted in a table, and her garments
with the which she apparelled her
selfe as one readye to go vnto a triumphe
which mayden shortlye after, caused her
husband to bee seperated frō her through
false accusations vttered by her. And by
that meanes was shee both a cause of damage,
aud iniurye to her of the tryumph▪


                  
A certayne man dreamed, that an Eagle
drawinge fourth his bowels, flyed along
the city vnto the Burse or such like place
where much people were gathered together,
and to shewe theym to the behoulders
in that place. After whiche ensued,
that the father hauinge then no children,
should haue a sonne of greate reporte and
fame in that Citye For the eagle signifyed
the present yeare in whiche the childe
should be borne, and the bowels signifyed
the sonne, and the cariage also of thē vnto
the place of the assembly of the people, signified,
the worthines & fame of the sonne.
               And one thought in his sleepe, to bee
thrust into a yooke, and to bee yooked to
gether wythe hys brother, whyche was
longe before dead and that hee thoughte
also hys mother so yooked hym, and to
force hym to drawe lyke an Oxe, shee rulynge
their collores. Who after so dreaminge
came sicke to his mothers house
and ther died, and after was buried with
his brother, and thus the sorowfull mother
cowpled these two drawinge beastes
together.
               A certayne woman thoughte in her



sleepe (whyche wished to haue children)
that shee sawe certayne midwyues stoles
in whiche women vse to sitte, at the trauayle
of chylde, swymminge on the Sea
who then happened to be with childe, yet
not made a mother by this, for that shee
brought foorth seuen children, one after
the other and none of theym liued but dyed
in their swathing clothes.
               A certayne person thought in his sleepe
that he sawe a large clefte tree, and that
the one halfe to be a whyte Popler, and
the other halfe, a Pyne tree.
               And that on the Poplare tree sate all
kyndes of byrdes, but on the Pyneaple
sate gulles, and all kynde of Sea foules.
After whiche ensewed, that hee had two
Sonnes, of whiche the one led the life of
a common Wrastler, and bearer of heauye
burdens, lyke to a Porter, whiche
the Poplare signified, and trauaylynge
into manye countreys, was hyred of manye
straungers to laboure and trauayle,
hyther and thyther. But the other
although hee were a husbandmans sonne
became the maister of a shippe and a skilfull
Mariner. and hee whiche sawe



the dreame liued vnto a verye olde age,
and ended his lyfe happely.
               A certayne souldyar sleepynge in hys
captaynes chamber, in the nyghte cryed
out in his sleepe. To whom the captaine
called, demaundinge what hee ayled to
whom the dreamer aunsweared that hee
thought one gaue hym a deadlye wounde
on the heade that he was neare dead with
all, and for feare of the same soe awaked
out of sleepe. Which his captaine thus
bearing, that loued him verie wel, willed
yea and straightlie commaunded, that he
shoulde not goe foorthe of the house that
day. But his felowes the nexte daye
followinge, prepared to fighte with their
enemies, went forth, and he forgettinge
his dreame went also with thē. At the last
they settynge on their enemies, were in
the ende forced toflye, and in the returne
and flyinge away, was he deepe cutt one
the head and their slaine.
               
                  Augustus on a time beinge sicke, lying
then in Campe amongeste his Souldiars,
was warned by that worthie Philippe
his phisition in a dreame, whiche
he sawe that nighte in his pauilion, that



hee shoulde be set vppon and murdred of
hys enemyes, who priuily vpon the same
was conueied from thence. And the souldyers
of Brutus, the next day followyng,
entred into his pauilion and made manye
hooles wyth their swordes throughe hys
couche or bedde, supposing that hee had
bene there.
               And one thought in his sleepe that hee
kepte his mothers funeral and that he be
wayled, and sighed bitterly for her, insomuch
that he waked out of sleepe for feare
of the same. And the next morrow, when
he had told his dreame vnto his frend he
noted that daye, and within afewe dayes
after he receiued letters that the daye before
the same day he had his dreame at
night the mother whom hee supposed to
be alyue dyed.
               And one thought in his sleape, that he
sawe hymselfe drowned in the water, and
that hee mynded to refrayne from swymmyng
y• day following. Who on the morrow
forgettyng his dreame, wēt to swimmynge
& there was drowned ye same day.

behynde her, thoughte in his sleepe, that
she sayd to hym, I wil haue my daughter
wythe me, who thoughte he often denyed
her in soe muche as hee thoughte shee
sayde to hym, do what you will, for I wil
haue the mayden with me.
               After whiche folowed, that within
tenne dayes after the mayden dyed wythout
griefe or any complayninge.
               A certayne standerde bearer beynge
of fame, thoughte in his sleepe, that hee
was grenouslye pulled and racked wythe
his felowes. Who in the morninge after
he had shewed the same to his felowes,
laughed hym to scorne. And the same
morninge all were bidden by the gouernoure
of the Cittye vnto a feaste, vnto
whiche all wente sauinge the dreamer,
whiche priuelye conueyd hymselfe from
thē. And after dinner they were all throwen
into prisone, where they were examined
one by one on the racke, & the captayne
also wyth them, so that one of the
inferiour souldiours at the lengthe, was
openlye drawen and torne in peeces, and
the rest of the companye dispoyled, and
so let go.
               
                  
A certayne man thought in his sleepe,
that after a Tyraunte of that Citye, had
slayne two of his Chyldren, the one of
theym sayde hee should geue no heede to
the dreame. And that it woulde come
to passe, that in the daye folowinge, hee
should be made prince of the Citye.
               Whoe awaked (in that hope) a rose, and
sette vppon the Tyraunt, and slewe hym.
For the whiche good turne done hee was
after made Gouernoure or Prince of the
City. A certayn person being troubled
for a certayne debte whyche his father
shoulde owe in his lyfe tyme, and contynuinge
verye sad for the same, thoughte
hee sawe in his sleepe, the shadowe of hys
Father, whiche then instructed hym of
the moneye payde, and where the obligation
was layde. Who when hee arose
out of sleepe, founde the obligation in the
same place, where the Fathers shadowe
had taught hym whiche by that meanes
cleared that vniuste debte demaunded of
hym.
               A certayne manne beynge the Sonne
of a philosopher, after hys fathers death
sought a certayne boke of his, and coulde



not fynde the same for the whiche hee became
verye sadde. After whyche in a
certayne nighte his father appeared to
him in a sleepe, whoe shewed to hym the
place where the booke lay hydde. Whoe
awakinge in the morninge soughte the
booke there and there as he shewed hym
he founde it, that by the same helpe, the
booke myghte come and serue vnto all ages
hereafter.
               Before the battayle against the Philippians,
a certayne souldiar thoughte in hys
sleepe, that Iulius Caesar spake to hym,
sayinge shewe as he thought vnto Octauius
that hee shall fighte the happyer and
luckyer, if soo bee hee take some of these
thynges wyth hym, whyche I, whyles
I was heade gouernour, was accustomed
to weare and cary aboute me. Which
Octauius vnderstandinge, got after the
rynge to weare, wyth the whiche Caesar
had accustomed to seale letters, and the
same hee woore not onelye before the battayle,
but many tymes afterward.
               The day before that Henry the french
kynge was wounded in the eye, Queene
Margaret his wyfe as men report, saw



sorte as the dreame foreshewed.
               And two familiar frendes on a tyme
went a iourney vnto Megara, where they
both lodged that nighte, but the one iodged
in a Tauerne & the other man Inne.
Who after they had supped went to bedd
and sleepynge in their bedd, he which laye
in the Inne thoughte in his dreame that
he praied the other that hee woulde come
helpe hym that he were not slayne by his
hoste, who awaked wythe his fearefull
dreame arose vp, and after hee had well
loked aboute, and considered the matter
wyth hymselfe, & perceyued also the sight
no further shewed of the matter, he then
layde hym downe agayne to sleepe. And
then to hym sleapynge, be thought again
that the selfesame sight to desire him that
seynge woulde not helpe him when bee
was alyue, yet that he woulde not suffer
his deathe vnreuenged, and that hee also
slayne, was conueyed into a Carte by the
hoste of the house, and dounge subtyllye
throwen vppon hym, besydes that the
sighte as hee thoughte to requyre hym
that timely in the morninge hee woulde
watche at the Gate, before the dounge-Carte,



went forth of the towne.
               Whoo greatelye moued wythe the feare
and care of this dreame, arose tymelye
and came vnto the Gate of the Towne,
where he founde the dunge Carte there
waytynge to go forthe, by which stode a
herd man that draue the Cart, and of the
herd man he demaunded what he there
caried in the dounge carte but he beinge
feared wyth hys wordes ran away. And
hee in the meane whyles drew the deade
body out of the carte, after which the host
was examined and confessinge the deede
had the lawe.
               A certayne person hauinge sundrye
children and none liued wyth hym.
               At the laste his wyfe beynge with chylde
thought then in his sleepe, that it was
sayde vnto hym, that hys Sonne shortlye
after borne shoulde be named Iouinianus.
               
               After whiche the Father died, and the
childe liuynge still was made Emperoure.
               And one John Marya a gentilman of
Venice beynge then a ruler at Dalmatia
thought that he sawe in sleape, another of



his brothers which he dearlye loued, named
Donatus, to imbrace him, & to saye
farewell because he must departe oute of
mens companye. And that John maria
after he had followed him a whiles weepinge
as he thought awaked for the feare
out of sleepe, fyndinge himselfe all wette
wyth teares, and thus amased feared the
lyfe of his brother beyng then at Venice.
               
               After whiche aboute the thirde day before
were letters brought from his house
which signified or declared the same, that
that Donatus died that night and in the
same hower that he dreamed the lyke.
               And yt thre dayes also before his death,
he had lyen sicke of the plague.
               And a certayne woman thoughte in
her sleeape, that her husbandes first wyfe
rebuked the seconde mariage, and that
warninge her as shee thought that shortly
after she woulde take her away wythe
her. Who indeede dyed wythin a short
tyme after.
               And acertayne parson thought in his
sleepe, that hee sawe the Sonne shyninge
on the earthe, who endeuoured wyth hys
handes to catche the sonne, but it seemed



to slip from hym. And this hee proued in
y• order thre tymes togither, after which
he demaūded of certayne wyse mē what
thesame mighte signifye, who tolde hym
that he shoulde raygne after .rxx▪ yeares.
For the Sonne signifyed hym to bee a
Kynge, but if it had determined the king
dome'onely for three yeares, then had it
not beene needefull whye hee shoulde see
thys. For no kinge of fame as onely one
lyke as the so
                     •
                  ne is, coulde escape daunger,
for so shorte a tyme. Yet it ended
otherwyse by broofe for that hee raygned
from the .xl. yeares of his age, vnto threscore
and ten.
               A certayne person thoughte in his sleepe
that hee was alone in a Cockebote on a
tempestuouse Sea, and that the wynde
blewe boysterouslye, and the ayre also semed
so darke, that he was without hope
of escapynge to land wyth lif▪ And beyng
in this perplexitye, he catched hold as he
thoughte of a Tree, and hanged by the
handes on the same, throughe the Boote
mounted or carried vp to the same, and
fo remayned he there aliue as he thought
wythout further succoure.
               
                  
After whiche followed that hee euer
after liued a carefull life and neuer could
haue good successe in his businesses and
requestes, nor obtaine his desire.
               Besides it further signified, the alteration
of his kinde of life, and that through
a sorrow neare at hand, he shoulde fall into
a desperation; which persone besides
liued twenty years after he had this dreame,
but yet oppressed wyth manie griues
and sorrowes.
               And a woman named Accia whiche
was the mother of Octauius, beinge thē
withe childe with him dreamed that her
bowels were caried vp to heauen, and
that they were also made manifeste and
throughlye knowen vnto al the earthe,
and heauen aboue. After which followed,
that the bowelles signifyed the
Sonne, whiche she then bare in her bodie
that through his greate power on earthe
his bruite and report shoulde after reache
vnto the starres.
               And Octauius the father of Augustus
dreamed, that hee sawe the brightnes
of the sonne arisinge out of the wōbe
of his mother Accia. After whyche



succeded, that the dedes of Augustus did
lyke shyne and appeare amongest the mē
of his age, as the brightnes of the sonne,
in the worlde.
               A certaine Lumbard dreamed, that he
saw an Aungell discendynge from heauē
clothed in yellowe, and makynge wyde
steppes on the grounde, but hee hadd no
wynges. Whiche sighte so feared the
dreamer coniecturyng that the same signifyed
some feare full matter that he hid
hymselfe as he thought in a verye darcke
hole nere by, and couering hymselfe ouer
withe the leaues of trees, whereby hee
myght so lye hyd out of sight. And the
Angel after he was discended, called the
dreamer by his name; but he lyinge hy
                     •
                  
as hee thought aunsweared not. In so
muche, that after the Aungell had called
hym thryse, sayde hee will not come, and
so departed. Whoe after for feare, awakyng
oute of slepe, thought the same
signifyed some greate perill to happen to
hym that day following.
               Wheruppon he caused the outward dore
of his house to be fast shutt and that none
to go out, but the key he gaue to the maiden



to keepe. Who after forgettinge her
maisters cōmaundemente let in a familyer
frende of the dreamers that came to
hys presence vnwares to hym, whych infected
wythe the pestillente ayre aboute
hym, many of his houshold, but the dreamer
vppon the sight got oute priuilye by
the roofe of the house. After whiche died
xii. of the plague, for that the same happened
in such a contagious season.
               But he escaped through his skilfull practyse,
whiche for that he coulde hyde hym
selfe in the denne or hoole the same signified
by the dreame.
               
                  C. Fannius after that he had written
three bookes agaynste the lyfe of Nero,
thought in his slepe, that he lay apparayled
on hys bed as hee was wonte to dooe
lyke to other studientes, and that Nero
came to him and, plucked forth ye bookes
oute of his bosome. And that hee also
diligently loked on the first, after on the
seconde & then on the third which he turned
to & fro not vttering or speakyng any
word, but shutryng vp the bokes so departed.
Wherby Fannius learned, y• before he
shoulde finishe any more bokes to these,



that he should end his lyfe with ye worke,
who within a shorte time after died.
               
                  Sylla a head officer in Rome, thought
in his sleape, he sawe the deuill, and that
he called hym, who after he awaked, although
he were then in health sente for
his frendes who after they were come
together, caused in their presence his wil
to be written wyth all speede, and after
signed the same, fearynge death to be at
hande. Who in the night following was
taken with an ague, of whiche he dyed wt
                  in
fewe dayes after. But some write that
he was eaten wyth lyce: And others write
that hee died of a greate anger whiche
he toke agaynst a Burgeys of that Cittye
through whiche he castinge vp much
bloud dyed thereof.
               And one Rinaldus Villanoua a Phisition
wryteth that a certayne parson often
saw in his sleepe that a blacke Catte
did bite or gnaw his litle finger: Who
shortly after was taken with the eatynge
Cankar in that finger of whiche he died.
               And one Arianus thought in his sleepe
that his father ministred a sleapynge
drincke to hym, who not longe after dyed



For the deade slepe signified death which
afterward ensued.
               And when a certayne personne dispaired,
that he shoulde not attayne the Garlande
for the lacke of knowledge, his brother
then dreamed, that he had loste hys
fathers ringe, and seekynge a long whiles
for it, founde it at ye last as he thought,
fallen into a deepe hole, and that hee reached
& gotte the same foorth wyth a long
staffe. Which the interpreter thus expoū
                  ded
yt his brother vndoubtedly should attayne
the Garlande & that throughe the
helpe of a taule man, whiche accordingly
did so happen, to the wonder of manye.
               And a certayne woman of the country
shewed vnto the wyfe of the kyngs heard
man, that she thought in her sleape, that
she brought forth or was deliuered of the
Moone, which shyned ouer al Britayne.
After whiche the woman beynge delyuered
of a mayden chylde, the wyfe of the
kynges heardman nursing then the kynges
Sonne, brought vp the chylde wyth
hers, as her owne. Who after growen to
elder yeares the kingest sonne fel in loue
wyth her, throughe the familiaritye in



youth and of thys maryed her, of whom
he begate Echelstane who after flourished
and accounted the worthiest king, for
hys vertue and fortune.
               And one Ecelinus a Romayne, in the
first nighte after mariage, thought in hys
sleape that hee sawe a hil on which Rome
was s
                     •
                  ituated, an yt the same rose heigher
and hygher to an exceadynge heighte,
after whiche he thought it shronke away
lyke the meltyng of snow, that at the last
there seemed nothing to remayne.
               Whiche dreame of his lyke succeaded by
the fortune of his children. For Ecelinus
the elder sonne after his name, through a
small fortune attayned Verona, Vincē
                     tia,
padua Feltrius and the Region of
Tarnisina and Marchia. And Albericus
the yonger brother, obtayned Ternisius
it selfe and sundrye other places. But after
certayne years, this Ecelinus losing
his kingdome was woūded and takē and
neare to Soncinus dyed. And Albericus
at the losing of Tarnisius, fledde vnto the
Castel of Zeno, wher of his owne mē, he
was betrayed, after whiche he sawe. 6 of
hys sonnes slain before hym, and his wyfe



wyth two daughters burned. And him
selfe through diuers kyndes of tormentes
butcherly delt wythall, yelded vp a lamentable
spyrite. And now on this wise
was the whole stocke as the father hadde
foreseene wyth power vtterlye extincted.
               A certayne person came to one Hyburis
Aebaneus an Interpreter of Dreames
and sayde I dreamed this night past
that I had cornes of Barlye in my hande
which I did cast into my mouthe to eate
them: to whom the expounder thus answea
                     •
                  ed
wel be it vnto you. And after he
was departed, the expounder asked the
stāders by, whether any there were, that
knew hym: to whō one aunswered, that
he knewe hym verye well and where hee
dwelled. Well sayd ye enterpreter, marke
and haue regard after hym, for that shortlye
he shall dye, in that he thus eate vppe
his nourishemente. Who in verye dede
accordinge to his saiynge died within fower
dayes after.
               
                  Alexander the Philosopher thoughte
in his sleepe, that hee was iudged to dye,
and for al meanes and excuses yt he coulde
shewe, hee coulde scarcelye hee deliuered



from sufferynge. Who after feared no
suche matter for that hee onelye applyed
hymselfe to the studye of Philosophy, yet
the next day followinge when he came to
reasoninge wyth another philosopher verye
hotlye, he was theere stricken on the
head wyth a staffe, and hardlye escaped
death.
               And the wyfe of Diognosta dreamed,
to haue halfe a bearde, who after lyued
seperate from her husbande, so that if she
had thought to haue a whole bearde, then
after to be a wydowe.
               A certayne Lumbarde so often as he
should wyn, dreamed in the night before,
that he did eate whyte grapes. For the
whyte grapes do protende a plentifull, &
easy encrease of labour. But the blacke
grapes do signify a small gayne, and that
wyth tedions trauayle. Nowe such a
custome of his endured for twelue years,
and after decayed.
               A certayne learned Phisition there was
who so often as he dreamed, that hee saw
his mother beyng deade, very sadde, the
nexte daye followinge hee fell sicke, and
that by good reason, for that sonne is



most deare to the mother, & that her sadnes
also signifyeth the calamityes to the
child, and not the lyke to the father. For
fathers are not like moued to mourne for
the sicknesses of their sonnes, except those
sicknesses are deadly, in that mē are stouter
of mynde and stomacke, then women.
And he was also sickly by nature, so that
he dreamed the lyke many yeares.
               A certayne gentleman, as Mattheus
Ferrarius wrytethe, that howe often hee
thought that he did eate in his sleape, and
so often in the day following he was payned
with ye stone. And if so be he thought
that hee didd eate harde thinges of digestion,
then the payne continued manye
dayes after. So that by good reason we
saye that wee so well taste of sorrowes,
as meates.
               And to Valentinianus Emperour the
day before he dyed, beynge yet not sicke,
for that he dyed sodenlye, appeared hys
wyfe clothed in mourning apparell, and
standinge a farre of wythe her heare shed
abroade. Which well declared the former
fortune, that then had lefte hym in
so lamentable cause.
               
                  
And one Policrates Samius a tyraunte
whyles he was in prosperitye, his daughter
on a tyme thought in her sleepe, that
she sawe her father hanginge on highe,
whome Iup
                        •
                     ter washed, & the Sunne annoynted.
After which followed that he
beynge oueecome of Oròtes, and hanged
on a gibbite happened the lyke so that he
was after washed with the raine fallinge
and annointed of the Sunne, by meltyng
of his fatte, whiche so seemed to anoynte
him.
               And one thought in his steape, that he
sawe his house on fyer, whoe after receyued
letters that his brother lay greuouslye
sicke, & whyles he prepared hymselfe
to iourney, a messenger came declaring
hym to be dead. Who after counted the
tyme, from that hower which he saw the
dreame, conceiued that his brother
then dyed. But cōmonly this
dreame doth threaten death
eyther to the dreamer, or
some principaller of
the house.



hymselfe to be with child, if so be he hath
bene poore, hee shall after possesse muche
substaunce and shal gather and keepe and
heape together aboundaunce of money:
but if he be rych, it signifieth that he shalbe
in torments & cares or troubles of the
mynde: And he whiche shall haue a wyfe,
that he shall loose her, for it signifyeth, y•
she shal not after beare him more childrē
but he whiche shal haue no wyfe, that he
shal after marrye suche a kynde and gentle
wyfe, that he may fynde in his hart to
wysh to beare and suffer that payne, that
his wife susteneth in the traueile of child.
And to others this dreame doth signifye
sickenesse. To be wyth chyld and after
to be deliuered thereof, is euill, for it declareth
that the personne beynge sicke,
shall shortlye after dye. For euery bodye

                     •
                  earyng, sendeth forth a spyrite: and like
as the infante by ioyninge hymselfe with
the bodye is deliuered, and departeth frō
it euen so the soule dothe from the bodye:
and to a poore man, hyred seruaunt, or to
anye whiche is in calamitye or misery: it
signifyethe a deliuerye of the presente euilles
or mysery, and that cause is manifest



or apparaunte, but to riche men, vsurers,
and other occuppers and to such
also as be in authoritye and power it harmeth.
For they whiche had before, shall
after lacke, and loose much. And to marchauntes,
pylottes, maisters, and owners
of shippes, it signifyeth good lucke after,
but to many it happēeth that also should
lose by thys dreame, as kinsfolke, because
the infant in his byrth, is reiected and seperated
from the bloud.
               If any in the maner of babes dreameth
that he thinketh hymselfe to bee swadled
lyke a chylde, and to suck of a womā that
he knoweth, dothe portend after a longe
sicknesse, except he hath a wyfe wt chyld.
For thē shalbe borne a sonne lyke to himselfe,
whiche in thesame manner shallbee
fedde, and brought vppe. But if a woman
shall see this dreame, it doth signyfy
that she shalbee deliuered of a daughter
lyke to her selfe: and if anye woman
thinketh in her dreame to haue milke in
her breastes, to a yonge woman it promiseth
conception, and perfecte fruite, and
byrth also, but to an olde woman beinge
poore, it signifyeth riches, and to a riche



woman, it signifyeth expenses and charges:
And to a mayde mariageable, this
dreame promisethe to her mariage, for
notwythout the venerall act of coactyng,
milke in the breastes cannot at any tyme
be had, but if the mayden be young, that
shee cannot be maried of a longe tyme for
her age and making thē this dreame portendeth
to her death. Also to a poore and
needye man, this dreamepromiseth plentye
bothe of monye and possessions, that
he may also be able to feede others. And
further to hym whiche is vnmaryed, this
dreame promiseth a wyfe: and to hym hauinge
a wyfe, whiche lacketh or hath no
children: this dreame promiseth also children,
as hath bene found true in both.
               For thone had after such a kynd and gentle
wyfe, that he did wishe to suffer al her
trauailes and paines. And the other had
children after, which he fed and brought
vppe: And to wrastlers, warriars, and
suche as exercise the strength of the body
it thretneth sicknesse: For that effeminat
bodyes haue milke: and any also hauinge
a wyfe, and children in his dreame is depryued
of his wyfe, for he after bryngeth



vp his children, and ministrynge to them
the equall vse, both of the father and mother.
               To dreame that he thinketh hymselfe
to haue a greate or bigg heade signifyeth
good to a ryche man, whiche as yet is no
Magistrate or high officer. And to a pore
man, warriour, vsurer, and that kepeth
a bancke of monye. to them it signifyeth
both good luck, and the gatheryng together
of much money, but to a ryche man
whiche is in authority. And to a Rhetoritian,
Judge or Legate, yt denounceth
bothe slaunders of the people, and losse of
dignitye and honour. And to a sicke person,
this dreame signifyeth beuynes and
payne of the heade: and to dreame that
he thinketh himselfe to haue long & fayre
heare and to be proude of it, signifyethe
good especiallye to a woman, for women
oftentymes vse for bewties sake, to decke
and sette forth their heades wyth others
heare: besydes, this dreame signifyeth
good, to a Philosopher, Kinge, Prince,
Prieste and Religious, and to all those
also whose profession byndethe theym to
weare their heare longe. But to haue



muche heare on the heade, rufled and out
of order, lyke to those whiche wee name
bushe naturalles, signifyeth to all suche
personnes, heauines and losse. As the
lyke was experienced in one, whoe dreamed
that he hadde his heare snarled and
rufled together, muche lyke to a pycked
torche. and he after was depriued of his
liuynge, to hys greate sorrowe and heauines.
And further to haue bristled heere
lyke a Swine, doth portende violente perilles,
by some ill fortune: But to haue
horse heere signifyeth bondages, painful
laboures and cares of mynde with heauinesse:
and to iourneymen or suche like,
imprisonmente. And to dreame also that
he hath wolle growinge on his heade, in
the stede of heare to him that so dreameth
it promiseth long sicknes & both ye P
                     •
                  hisick,
and consumptiō of the body. And besydes
if any dreameth that his face to bee
roūd about, bare & naked of heare, it portendeth
presentlye a mocke or gyle and an
vnhappye successe. But if any dreameth y•
the hynder part of the head to be on such
wyse to hym that so dreameth, it signifyeth
in his ould age pouerty & great mise-



For the hynder part of the heade, is contrarywyse
signifier of the time to come.
And agayne who that dreameth that the
ryght syde of his head is balde or bare o
                     •
                  
heere, signifieth that hee shal loose al his
male kynue that be nigh vnto hym and if
he shall haue no kynne alyue, then it signifyeth
damage or harme to hym selfe.
               And if ye left side of the head be bare it signifyeth
that he shall lose his nyghe kinswomen,
if he shal haue any one aliue, but
if not, thē he shal incurre damage to himselfe.
For the heade hath the signifycatiō
of the kindredes, as the righte sydes of it
the males, and the left sides the females.
And who that dreameth that he hath eyther
side of ye head naked or bare of heere,
shall after 
                     •
                  ee condemned vnto an open
woorke or laboure adiudged therto. To
dreame yt hee thinketh al his whole heade
to be shauen signifyeth euill: for that this
dreame portendeth good to none but such
as be accustomed to be shauen, as fryers,
monckes, abbottes, fooles, aud such like:
to saylers and marriners on the sea▪ thys
dreame threatneth shipwracke, & to sicke
persons to be neare deathes dore but yet
not death.
               
                  
And to dreame that he clippeth his owne
heyre, signifyeth sodayne bewayling, or
calamity, threatned by great euills.
               But to dreame that a barber clyppeth
his heare doth promise a lyke to hym and
to all personnes good lucke and ioye for
that it hath the signification, both of ioy
and the exception of other causes. And
truly there is none beyng in any euill or
wofull case, or els in any calamitye, that
clippeth the heare of his heade: but suche
as be free from these, and hath somewhat
to take to. Therefore this dreame promiseth
deliuerie out of trouble, to such as be
in thraldome, and good lucke also to all
personnes. To dreame that the foorheade
is whole without crasinge or disease, and
sleshye is good to all personnes and signifyeth
the libertye of speakinge, and fortitude.
But to dreame that hee thinketh
himselfe to haue a forhead of brasse, Iron,
or stone signifyethire, hatred, and ennemyes:
But to ruffians, and those yt keep
                     •
                  
brothel houses and baudes, and to suche
also as I
                     •
                  ade their lyues wythoute shame
it signifyeth good.
               And to dreame that hee thinketh himselfe



to haue many eares, signifyeth good
to him whiche woulde attayne any to bee
obedient to hym, as wife, children, or seruaunte.
But to a rych man this dreame
signifyeth a greate name, & good also, yf
the eares shalbe faire & cōly: but if the eares
shal appear deformed & out of fashion
it signifyeth slaūder of the people: & this
dreame is euell to a seruaunt, and to one
also hauinge a cause or matter in iudgement
or before a iudge, for either he must
sue or trouble another by action, or ells
be called by another into iudgemente, for
it signifyeth to hym obedience, of a longe
tyme. And besydes lyke as he sueth thys
man by action it so shalbe done, the lyke
agayne by hym: But if the cause or matter
be called or brought into the tryall of
the lawe, then shall he heare many more
faultes or crymes to be obiected agaynst
hym, thē whiche be manifest or apparaūt
that in a certaine maner he may nede many
eares, but to a handye craftes mā this
dreame signifyeth good for he shall heare
many persones, whyche do require & desyre
his worke: but to lease thy eares also
which thou hast signifieth cōtrarye to



those aforesayde. And to purge or clense
the eares of filthe or matter, signifyeth y•
he shal heare frō some place good newes
or tydinges, but, if any dreameth that he
thinketh to beate his owne eares, it portendeth
the hearynge of yll newes frome
some place.
               And to dreame that hee thynketh pysmiers
to creepe into hys eares, signifieth
good alonly to dissemblers of wysedome
which wee name Sophisters. And the like
the pismiers signify to yong men, that
go to heare suche persons, but to others,
this dreame denounced death. For
that they bee the daughters of the earth,
in whiche they harboure and dwell. And
if any dreameth that he thynketh to haue
eares lyke an asse, signifyeth good to philosophers
alone, for that the asse moneth
not his eares lightlye or quickly: But to
other personnes, this dreame signifyeth
bondage, & paynufll labors or cares of the
mynde with heauines. And if any dreamethe,
that hee thinketh to haue eyes in
his eares, signifyethe that hee shall after
be blynde, & shall come to knowledge o
                     •
                  
those thinges by hys hearyng and eares,



whiche he sawe afore wyth his eyes.
               And if anye dreameth that he hathe a
quicke sharpe fyght of the eyes: sygnifyeth
good by ryghte to all personnes
but to dreame that he thinketh hymselfe
blind, doth indicate neadines of money, &
to hym whiche hath children, it signyfyeth
that his children shall be sicke. And to
dreame also that hee thinke the hymselfe
blinde of both the eyes signifieth to his
childrē wt seeth the dreame, the losse both
of brethrē father & mother. And to ye children
because the eyes be lyke to them.
               But to the brethren, because the eys also
in themselues be lyke brethren: & to the
parentes, because the eyes bee the cause
that we see the lighte lyke as the father
and mother also be. Wherefore the losse
of the eyes signifyeth the losse of the lyke
but to hym which is in prison, if he thinkethe
hymselfe to be blynde, it signifyeth
good & a notyce y• his misery is at an end.
And this dreame also signifyeth good, to
those that be very indigente, and poore:
but to a man of war, this dreame signyfieth
euill and greuouse, for that 
                     •
                  his yll
successe, and to suche also as lyue in the



courte: but yet to men of armes or champions,
this dreame promysethe victorye:
As the lyke happened to a certayne chā
                  pion
that shoulde haue cōbat or fought in
the honor of hys countrye, who dreamed
that he thought he was blynde. which after
wan the victorye. Also this dreame to
maysters and pylottes of shippes, signify
heauines and sorrow: and to such whiche
bee occupyed wyth the contemplation of
celestiall
                     •
                  matters, which, hath oftē bene
obserued. And if any seekinge any thing
lost shal se this dreame, shall after se that
thinge lost no more: nor following after
a fugitiue or that runneth away shal take
hym: but to sicke persons, this dreame
doth alwayes portende death: for the priuation
of their light.
               And one thoughte in his dreame, that a
certayne credible man sayde to hym, thy
father is not dead but sleapeth, whose father
was then become presentlye blynde
and not long after one brought him word
of the same matter. And if any shall dreame
yt he thinketh hymselfe blynde of the
twone eye▪ shall haue those thinges happen
to hym whiche bee signifyed of that



part: For this is to be considered and noted
that the ryght eye, both signifieth the
sonne, brother, and father. And the lefte
eye, both the daughter sister and mother
               That if any haue two sonnes, or two
daughters, or two brethren, or two sisters:
then the ryghte eye signifyeth the elder
sonne, or brother, or father or els the
elder daughter. But the left eye signyfyeth
the yonger daughter, or brother, or
els yonger sonne. And besydes to dreame
that hee thinketh to haue three or fower
eyen, to hym which hath purposed to marye
a wife, & to hym also whiche lackethe
or hath no children it signifieth good▪ For
to the one a wyfe shall happen, and to the
other children & so aboute one body shal
be manye eyes. And one thought in his
dreame to haue three eyes, whoe after became
blynde. For the third, which sygnifyed
the neede & lacke of the other light
because ye proper light suffyced not. And
further to a naughty and wicked man, &
to beutifull women: many eyes signifye
euell. For manye eyes shal waye on him
and aboute this woman shal many apparaunte
auoutries be wrought, & foūd or



taken. And further if any dreameth that
hee thynketh to haue eyen in his fingers
endes, or in his feete: signifyeth that hee
shal after become blynd. And a certayne
man dreamed, that he thoughte to haue
eyne about eche finger of the handes, who
after fel blynde.
               And if any dreameth that he thinkethe
to haue a greate and fayre nose, & comlye
in forme, signifyeth good to all persons:
for it signifieth a great subtillitye of senses,
& a foresight in doing matters.
               And hee that dreameth to haue no nose,
doth portende to hym, and to all parsōs
the losse and lacke of sences, and hatred
of his betters, and to a sicke person death.
For that the sculles of deade persons, bee
founde without nose: And if any thynketh
in hys dreame to ha
                     •
                  e two noses, it signifyeth
to haue variaunce or dsicorde wt his
betters in house.
               And to dreame to haue fat or full cheekes,
signifyeth good to al persons and especiallye
to women, but to haue thinne or
leane or els scabbed cheekes signifyeth
heauines or wailynge for the leane cheakes
signifyeth heauines & sorow, and the



blistered or scabbed cheekes, signifyeth
waylinge & mourning: For that in mourninges,
men are wont to teare & scrache
their cheekes.
               And he that dreameth to haue a greate
hearde, both thicke & rough, beyng a lerned
mā it signifyeth good & to a philosopher
also. And if a womā thinketh in her
dreame to haue a bearde, yf shee shalbe a
wydow she shall then fynde & haue a husbande
whiche shalbe so gentle a man, that
he may seeme to be of a myngled nature:
but if she shalbe maryed she shal then lese
her husbande, or shall departe from hym
and shall gouerne her house, lyke as shee
were husbande and wyfe excepte shee bee
wyth chyld, or hath a cause which is to be
iudged, but if shee be with chyld shee shal
then bringe foorth a son which after earnestly
beholdyng, shall think her selfe to
haue a beard. And to a man child, or very
yonge stripling, this dreame portendeth
death, because a bearde to a chylde, dothe
preuent his age. And if one thinketh in
his dreame yt his hearde falleth away, or
elles shauen of, or violentlye pluckt away
of any: doth portende not only the losse of



kinsfolke but also both domage, & a soul
confusion that shall happen to hym.
               And the losse of teeth, or els fallinge or
violently pluckinge out of them, doth for
the more parte signify, the losse or deathe
of kinsfolkes, or elles one of the same family
or housholde, or els the losse of substaunce:
For the lyke is to be applyed betweene
the house, family, and substaunce
therin, as is betwene the mouth, and the
teath. And besydes the ryght teeth signifye
the men, and the lefte teethe the wo:
men: excepte it so happē, that in on house
be all women, and in another house all
men: for then in those houses, the righte
teeth signify the elder, and the lefte teeth
the yonger persones. And further the
foor teeth signify verye yonge personnes,
and the sharpe teeth lyke to dogges teth,
signifye parsons of middle age: and the
cheke teeth, olde persons.
               And therfore who that dreameth co leese
any too
                     •
                  e, shall lose suche a frende, as
that tooth signifleth: but when not onely
men, but also the losinge possessions bee
signifyed: then is it thought or supposed,
that the cheke teeth to signify treasures



or riches layd vp orels hid. And ye sharp
teeth to signifie those thinges which bee
of no great momente or value.
               And the foreteeth signifye simple
                     •
                   householde
stuffe, or els other moneables within
the house. Therefore very lyke it is y•
some of them fallinge out, to signifye the
losse of money, ryches, & facultyes: & further
the teeth also signifye necessary matters
to lyfe, and of these the cheeke teeth,
signify secrete & priuie matters. And the
sharpe teethe signifye those thynges,
whiche be not manifest to many, and the
fooreteeth, signify most manifest, & open
maters, and these thinges which be compared
by the talke & worde. And therfore
the teeth fallinge out, be, or signifye the
hynderaunce or losse of the lyke matters,
to them belonginge, also all the teeth fallynge
out together, signify a desert house
lefte and forsaken by all the persons departinge
together from it. And further
teathe fallinge oute to those that be sicke
do signify a longe sickenes and the scabbes
or blistrings: but yet they giue theim
not to dye. For of the deade bodies, none
after leaseth a tooth. Wherfore what so



euer happeneth not to deade folkes, is a
notice of healthe to sicke persons yet better
it is that sicke persons to lose all their
tethe, for so the come yt s
                     •
                  ner to healthe
               And to a seruaunte to lose his teethe,
signifyeth after libertye & freedome. And
to marchauntes this dreame signifyeth
the spedy prouision a desposition of packes
and other goods, & especially if they
shalbe in that iourney wyth them. Allo
certayne of the teeth waxinge aboue the
others so that the on exceadeth the other
in bygnes, or elles that be louse and fall
not out, signifye sedicion or variaunce in
his house whiche seeth the dreame. And
who that thinketh in his dreame to haue
blacke, rotten, worme eaten, or broken
teath, and to lease theym, signifyeth the
deliuerye frome al trouble, and misery: &
yet some, as often tymes the elder men,
haue lost by this dreame: besydes he that
thinkethe in hys dreame to haue Juorye
teeth, signifyeth good to all persons: but
bee that thinkethe in his dreame, to haue
golden teeth, signifyeth especiallye good
to eloquēce & learned speakers: as it were
of the golden teethe pronōcinge the talke
                     •
                  


                  
but to others this dreame after threatneth
fyre and burning of the house which
se this dreame, and to certayne also this
dreame signifyeth sickenesse, cōmyng and
beynge of the multitude of choller. And
he yt thinketh in his dreame to haue teeth
of waxe, signifyeth that he shall come to
a speedy death, for such cannot chew meate
wyth them: and to haue teethe of leade
or tynne sygnifyeth reproche or infamy &
shame to ensue: And to haue teethe of
glasse or woode, doothe portende violente
death: and he that thinketh in his dreame
to haue siluer teethe, signifyeth to hym
that is learned, to get money by his talk,
and eloquence: but to riche men this dreame
portēdeth, the expence of money into
foode, and meates. And if any thinkethe
in his dreame that his foreteeth fal out &
the other grow in their places doth por
                     •
                  tend
the chaūge of life, into a better state
If so be the seconde teeth shalbee better &
fayrer, then yt other afore: but into a worser
state, if they shalbee worser & fouler.
               And he that thinketh in hys dreame to
haue a reasonable tongue and congruent
to the mouthe, and to speake freelye and



clearly with oute impediment, signifyeth
good to al personnes: but to dreame that
he cannot speake, or to haue the tongue,
bound or tyed in the mouth: doth portēd
the impedimente of actions or doinges,
and also pouerty. For as muche as pouertye
dothe take away, & prohibite the lybertye
of talke, and speakinge. And he yt
thinketh in his dreame, that his tonge
is swolen doth protende sicknesse to his
wyfe, which seeth the dreame, if he truly
hath a wife: if not, then sicknesse to him
selfe, But if any thinketh in his dreame,
to haue heares sprong out of his tongue
whether they be whyte or els backe, signifyeth
sicknes and sorrowe: but yet the
black hears cause these soner, & the white
heares later.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame, to
vomit much bloud, and of good colour, &
not corrupt, signifyeth good to a pore mā
for it portendeth the commynge to riches
and the aboundaunce of monye. And this
dreame is good to hym whiche hathe no
children, & to hym also, which hath a kinsman
out of his contrye: For the twone
after shall haue a sonne borne hym and



the other his kinsman came home againe
for booth be of one kynde of bloude, but
yf the bloud shall runne foorth into a vessell,
the chylde notwythstanding shall bee
brought vppe: and the kynsman shall lyue
dwellynge in a straung: countrye or oute
of his countrye, which also after hys cō
                  mynge
home shall dye. But if it shal run
downe on the grounde, then both shortly
after shal dye: and he which dwelt out of
his countrye, shall go into hys owne for
the bloud that is in hys grounde whyche
truely in his countrye. And he that thinketh
in his dreame, to cary or beare blod,
is both foolishe and to no purpose to him
whiche woulde be hid, for he shalbe manifested
and openly knowen. And he that
thinketh is his dreame, to vomitte black
or corrupte bloude, doth signifye by good
reason sickenes, to all persons. A
                     •
                  d hee
that thinketh to vomite a little bloude in
somuch yt not by vomittyng, but by spitting
it may seeme to be cast vp, doth portende
sedition as hath bene obserued.
               And to vomit choller, or flewme, to hym
whiche is in calemity or misere or els in
any perplexitye of mynde or sicknes, doth



signify the flakyng & ceassing of the presēt
euills: For all the refuses of such lyke, do
not molest or greue any more.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame to vomyt
vp his meate, or whosoeuer it be signifyeth
losse and trouble of that, that the
bodye feleth not the sustenances or fode.
And who also that thinketh to cast vp or
vomite out by the mouth, the greate guttes
or bowels, doth portend the deathe of
children, both to the man and wyfe: but
to theim whiche haue noe children, thys
dreame signifyeth the losse of the best and
moste precions thinge whiche they haue
in theire goodes, or that they sette most
store by. And to a lyke persone also, this
dreame portendeth death.
               And to hauet woo or three heades, to a
poore man it signifyeth ryches, & besides
for that he shall possesse and haue manye
heades y• he shall gather together greate
aboundaunce of goodes and riches: and
hys wyfe and children also shall happen
well and prosperous. But to a ryche man
this dreame signifyeth aduersity and loss
by kynsfolkes to a warriour this dreame
signifyeth good lucke,
               
                  
And who that thynketh in hys dreame
to haue his heade strycken of, eyther by
iudgemente condemned therto, or of theues,
or els in a tryumphe or turnemente,
or in any other maner signifyeth good:
But to hym hauynge parentes, this dreame,
signifyeth euell, or the lesse of them
and to him also hauing children, this dreame
signifyeth the like. For the head
is compared like to the parentes, because
they bee authors of lyfe: but the heade to
the children, for the. face and Image sake.
And a certayne man also hauinge a
house, dreamed the lyke: who after loste
the same. And by this dreame also it
signifyed, the losse both of wyfe, & frende.
               Besydes to the kepers of banckes
of monye and to vsurers, maysters of shippes
and marchaunts, and to al others also
that gather vppe money: this dreame
signifyeth the losse of greate summes of
money: but hee whiche dwelleth oute of
hys countrye that hee shall after returne
home: and hee also whiche is in perill of
lyfe by the lawe, that hee shall escape the
daunger. And further, yf anye sailing on
the Sea seeth thys dreame, it signifyeth



the losse of the top of a mast of the shipp,
except he be any of the mariners, whiche
seeth or saw the dreame.
               And in these lyke truly haue beene obserued,
to signify death to princes. And a
certayne Greeke dreamed yt he thoughte
hys head was striken of, who after came
to Rome, and so lost his former name &
dignitye. And he that thinketh in hys
dreame, to haue a heade lyke to a Lyon,
Wolfe, Panther or Elephante, shal obtayne
after the victory and ouerhande ouer
hys enemyes, and aduersaries, also
whych hee is in suite with. But hee that
thinketh in his dreame, to haue a heade
like to a dog, horse, asse, or any other four
footed beast, doth protende seruitude, bō
                  dage,
and care of mynde wythe heauines:
and hee also yt dreameth to haue a heade
lyke any kynde of birde: is a notice of peregrination,
and iourninge about.
               And further hee that thinkethe in hys
dreame, to haue his heade in his handes,
signifyeth good hap to hym whiche hathe
no children nor hath a wyfe and to hym
also lokinge for any dwelling oute of hys
proper countrye. And if any also thynketh



in his dreame, to haue hornes lyke
an Oxe or any other violente beaste, doth
portende vyolente deathe: but yet for the
more part it signifyeth headynge to hym
which seeth the dreame: For this like is
wonte to happen to all horned beastes.
               And the breaste whole, and sounde wythout
any hurt signifyeth good, but the breast
rough although it shalbe thicke of heare,
to men truly this dreame signifyeth
good, and lucratyue: but to women thys
dreame signifyeth, wydoweheade or the
losse of her husbande, and if the pappes
appeare greater then they wont to be, &
keepynge a comlines or fashion, signifye
both the obtayninge of children, and possessions
or goodes, but if the pappes appeare
sore, and as they weare blystred: do
portende siknesse to hym, whyche seethe
the dreame. And the pappes fallynge
frō the breast, signifyeth death to childrē
and to his children which seeth ye dreame:
and if not children then they promise nedines
Also they oftentymes signify waylinges
especiallye to women. For these
in theyr weepyng and wayling, do pull or
rent theyr papes. And who that thinketh



to be wounded on the breast of a certayne
familiar, and one well knowen to
hym, signifyeth to olde men hearynge of
sadde or heauy newes from some place:
but to yong men, and men of middle age,
and women this dreame promiseth loue.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame to
haue harde and fayre handes: signifyeth
felicitye or good happe: especially to handie
craftes men, which get their substāce
and lyuinge, by geuing oute wares, and
receyuinge in others too worke. But to a
personne fearyng or beynge in fear, this
dreame portendeth bynding, and bondes
or fetters: for not withoute feare this dreame
is. And further the one hande is
prepared to take thinges, and the other
feare to keepe theym. And besydes the
ryght hande, signifyeth the sonne, father,
frend or kynsman. And the left hande the
wyfe, mother, sister, daughter mayden
seruaunte and manseruaunt. And therefore
whiche of the handes any shal thinke
to lacke, shall lease one of those, whiche
be signifyed by that hande. But to maryners,
dauncers, or tomblers, & i
                     •
                  glers,



to haue no hands, is not good forasmuch
as it is impossible. to work and do moste
thinges without th
                     •
                  m, as it is manifest.
               And further to loose the fingers of his
handes, signifyeth damage or losse and to
dettours, to pay more then they owe: and
to vsurers, to be deceyued or begyled of
their vsurye.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame, to
haue heare growen oute of his handes, &
out of his ioynts of the fingers of the hā
                  des,
signifyeth Imprisonment.
               And who that thinketh in his dreame
to be pained or disseased in the great guttes,
or aboute the bottome of the bellye,
do denounce truelye sicknesse to the body
and nedines or barenes of liuinge.
               And if any shall thinke hymselfe payened
aboute the nauill parte: dothe eyther
portende the losse of parentes, or the priuation
of countrye.
               And if anye thinketh in hys dreame to
see his bodye cutt open and to see his inwarde
partes after nature, and eche decentlye
lyinge, signfyeth good to hym
whiche hathe no children, and to a poore
man. For the one shal after haue naturall



children, and the other possessions or
ryches. For the children be named the
bowels, lyke as also ye intrales or inward
partes. And lyke as the possessions or
goodes be in the house, euen so within the
greate guttes, be the bowels: but if anye
dreame that hee is cutte open, and that he
seeth nothinge of his inward partes lefte
within hym, signifieth that his house shal
after be desolate and forsakē, and the losse
also of children & to a sicke parson, death:
but this dreame signifieth good to those,
whiche bee in troubles or imprisoned, for
they shall soone after treade them vnder
their feete. And besydes the former spoken,
must here bee considered and applyed
lyke as the harte in the bodye, sygnifyeth
the wife of the man which seeth y•
dreame, and the husbād of the wyfe whiche
seeth the lyke. Also the lunges or
lyghtes, the lyke. But ye liuer signifyeth
the sonne sustenaunce and cares. And the
gaule the chollericke humoure, monye, &
women. And the mylte, signifyeth pleasures,
laughter & householde stuffe: An
                     •
                  
the bellye and great guttes, signifye children.
               
                  
And the kydneis signifye brethren, and
kynsfolkes: & therefore whē any of these
shalbee diseased, they portende the lyke to
that, that the membre signifyeth: also if
any member seemeth lackinge, it signifyeth
losse of the like member. And if any
thinketh in his dreame to se a plant sprōg
oute of his knees, doth portende that hee
shal after be stayed or hindered of the vse
of his knees, but if a sicke person shal see
this dreame be shall dye: For oute of the
earth al plantes do springe.
               Also a certayne man there was, who
dreamed yt he sawe a reede or ca
                     •
                  e growe
out of his right knee, whiche after had a
fistula ingendred in that knee.
               And to haue many fete signifyeth good
to marchaunts and maysters of shippes,
for they shal rule and gouerne seruaunts
wythe manye feete and this dreame also
signifyeth good to al those which nourysheth
and maintaineth seruauntes by byinge
and sellinge, and to a pylote or gouernoure
of a shippe. this dreame signifieth
ease, rest, and quietnesse: for that hee
shall vse many feete, in runninge and girdinge
forward the shippe wyth owers, or



els otherwyse by sayling. And to a poore
man this dreame signifyeth good, for he
shal attayne seruauntes but this dreame
to a ryche man dothe portend sickenesse,
for y• not with his owne feete, but by the
helpe & vse of a stay hee maye so seeme to
haue many feete. And further, to see the
feete burninge, signifyeth euil to all personnes,
& both losse, & decaying of goodes
and also of children and seruauntes.
               And who that thinketh in his dreame
to become bygger then anye man: dothe
portende death to him, whiche seethe the
dreame, and if any hauinge a litlte young
senne, shal thincke hym to become a man
or at a mans stature, doth portende tha
                     •
                  
his sonne shal dye: & this dreame is greeuous
to an olde man, to thinke hymself
                     •
                  
chaunged into a yonge man, & a yong mā
into a childe, for both of them passeth & i
                     •
                  
chaunged into the worser & simpler state▪
But good it is a childe to be chaunged i
                     •
                  
to a yonge man: and to a man to be chaunged
into an olde man, for bothe of the
                     •
                  
passeth, into the better and honowrable
estate. But if a yonge man shalbe chaū
                  
                     •
                  ged
into an oulde man, hee shall not dy
                     ••
                  like



as the childe, but shalbe sicke. And if
a man shall also be chaunged into a child
behauinge hymselfe vnwyselye, in doyng
matters shal susteyne damage. And further
the qualitye of chaunginge is thus:
that if any shal thinke himselfe also chaū
                  ged
into a woman, whiche before was a
man: signifyeth both good to a pore man
and seruaunte: for the one shal after haue
suche a persō which shal nourishe him vp,
lyke as a woman: & the other shall serue
after, with lesser labour. For the lesser be
womens laboures, which they do: but to
a riche man this dreame signifyeth euill,
and especialy, to an officer or one ruling
a Common weale for that women for the
most part bekepers of the house and occupyinge
themselues wythin that house,
wherefore to euery maiestrate, ruler, or
officer, this dreame doth damage and depriue
hym, whiche seeth it. But if a woman
shalbe chaunged into a man, yf shee
shall then be vnmaryed, shal after obtayn
a husbande, and if shee bee maryed and
shall lacke children, that shee shalbee deliuered
of a sonne, and so shee shall passe
into a very ill nature: but if shee hath a



hande, and sonne, she shall after be a wydowe.
For that a man nedeth not a man
but a woman. And besydes if anye mā or
woman, shal thincke hymselfe, to become
golde or siluer, yf he shalbe a seruaunte,
shall after bee solde, by whiche trulye hee
is made bothe golde and siluer: but if a
poore man shall see this dreame hee shall
after become ryche that suche a matter
thereby may be aboute hym.
               And this dreame to euerye sicke parsō
doth protēde death, lyke as to thinke him
selfe to become brasse, excepte it bee to a
warriour or seruaunt, but to be chaūged
into Iron doth signifye intollerable calamityes
and miseryes, enduryng to olde
age, to hym whyche seeth the dreame.
               And he that thinketh hymselfe to become
clay or to an earthen matter doth declare
deathe to all personnes excepte to those
which get their liuinge by the earthe or
by clay.
               And to become also a stone signifyeth
woundes and cuttes, to him which seeth
the dreame: & so in the same maner aman
must iudge of any other matter like.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame, to



exerise husbandrye, as eyther to sow, or
plow or els plant, signifyeth good to thē
whych seke a wyfe and haue no chyldren
for the fallowe fyelde is none other then
the woman, and the seedes and plantes,
the children: but the wheate the sonnes,
and the barly the daughters and abortyues.
Also to others this dreame signifyeth
sicknesse, and troubles of mynde: &
if any be sick in his house which seeth the
dreame, shall after dye.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame, to
gouerne a shippe wel, and wyselye, signifyeth
goode to all personnes For not
without feare and labour it is gouerned
and brought to any port. But if they be
vexed wyth tempestes or come to shyppewracke,
it d
                     •
                  th portende a myghtye euill
or harme to ensue which hath often bene
obserued.
               And to dye lether, signifyeth euil to al
personnes, but to see a
                     •
                  y Uisions in thy
dreame, signifyeth a most greate and daū
                  gerous
euill of all.
               And good it is to hym, that goeth into
a brothel house and commothe not againe
For a certayne man there was, whiche



dreamed that he thought he entered into
a brothelhouse, and coulde not go oute agayne,
and so not many a day after dyed.
               And this by good reason happening to
hym, for that the place is named common,
lyke as that also is, whiche receiueth the
deade & besides in this place happeneth ye
corruption of many mens seedes: Wherfore
that place is worthi lickned to death,
although those womē haue or be nothing
lyke of signification with ye place commō.
For they signify good for the moore part,
but the place is and signifyethe euill and
harme: whereof these harlottes that wāder
aboute, be commodiouser, to be seene
in the dreame then the others. And if any
thinketh in his dreame, to haue carnally
to doo wyth a straunge or vnknowen woman,
if she shal appeare to hym fayre and
gentle, & to haue one soft and swete apparel,
aud Jewels of golde aboute her, and
that shee shall also proffer herselfe to him
signifyeth good to hym whiche seeth the
dreame, nor promiseth the small happ of
actions: but if she shalbe an ould or foule,
or defourmed woman, and wearinge on
vnclenlye and ragged apparell doth denounce



that hee whiche seeth the dreame
shall after leade his lyfe in heauynes and
sorrow. And agayne if the woman aforesayde,
shall not offer herselfe to him, then
it signifieth the contraries to the former.
               For a man must suppose that womens
vnknowen Images to be of the actions,
happening to him which seeth ye dreame.
And if a mayster thinketh in his dreame,
that he hath to do with his seruaunt, it is
not good, for it signifieth despyte, and damage
by that seruaunt: whiche signifycation
also is of the brother, whether it bee
the yonger whiche hee companieth carnally
wyth, or the elder. And the lyke
iudgement, it is to be geuen of an enemy.
               And to lye wyth a woman familiarly
knowen and well acquaynted, if he shall
earnestlye loue her, and shall also desyre
her carnallye: doth portende nothinge to
him whiche seeth the dreame, for his intentyue
or fixed concupiscence, but if hee
shall not in his dreame earnestlye desire
her, it signifyeth good to him, if the woman
shalbe rych: for he shall alway after
get or obtayne of her some profit to hym,
or at the leaste by that woman which the



man seeth. And if any thinketh in hys
dreame to lye wyth a maryed wife, is not
good for the lawe sake. And to be moued
of a certayne familiar frende to a womā trulye,
it is both ioyoufe and profytable,
whosoeuer be, the earnest desyre shalbe,
But to be moued therto of a richer or elder
man signifyeth good, for that the maner
is to take of suche. And to be moued
of a yonger and needye person, is euil for
to suche the manner is to giue. And the
fame signifycation also if the elder shallbe
the mouer or procurer, and a begger.
And a certayne person beyng a seruaunt
dreamed that he thought he handled his
maysters priuitye: who after was made
schole mayster, and bringer vp of his children,
for he had then in his hands the masters
priuityes, being signified of the proper
children of his master.
               And if anye thinketh in his dreame to
wrastle with an vnknowen person it doth
induce daungers through a sicknesse: For
lyke as the wrastler coueteth to handle
his aduersarye, euen so the sicknesse, the
sicke person as to bringe him to the earth.
And further that a man to wrastle wyth



a childe, signifyeth also euill. For if hee
shal ouerthrowe or cast the childe, he shal
then bury some bodye. And to a chylde to
wrastle wyth a man, signifyeth good, for
there shall followe after greate matters,
besydes his expectation. And to wrastle
wyth a dead personne signifyeth sicknes,
or contencion and variance, wyth some of
the children or heires, of that dead parsō.
And besydes in wrastling, it is alwayes
better to ouerthrow or cast downe an ennemye
for thereof ensueth victory, to him
whiche seeth the dreame.
               And to eate browne breade to a poore
man it signifieth good, for that they most
commonlye feede ther vppon But to eate
whyte breade to poore men it signifyethe
sicknesse: for the contrarye cause. And to
riche men to eate browne bread, it signyfyethe
desperation: or that those thynges
whyche be presently hoped after shall not
be perfourmed or accomplished. And if anye
thinketh in his dreame, to eate barlye
bread, it signifyeth both good to hym,
and to al personnes.
               And if any thinketh in his dreame, that
no straunger, but his owne household do



see hym daunce, signifyeth both good to
hym and to all persons: But both hys
wyfe and children and some of his kinsefolkes
to see hym daunsinge, doth portend
good: for it signifyeth gladnes and
ioye, & the greate aboundance of goodes
of ryches: but yet to a person beyng sicke
as wel to a man, as woman, this dreame
signifyeth euill. And for the muche motiō
also of daunting, it signifyeth deceyuing
and dotage. Also this dreame signifyeth
euill to hym whiche is vexed or hath any
sicknesse on hym. But yf any shal dreame
that hee daūceth in some high place doth
portende that hee shal after fall sodenlye
into a feare or other perils. And if he bee
an offender, hee shal after be greuouslye
punished, for the reason of the highnes, &
stretching out of the handes.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame, to
singe songes or Ballates, and that wel &
trimlye, signifyeth goode as well to syngers,
as musitions, and to al other persō
                  nes,
but to singe euillye, and out of order
is a notice of yt vnprosperous or vnluckelye
successe of matters, and, actions, and
po
                     •
                  ertye.
               
                  
But when those songes any shal remember,
then by those songes he muste make
his iugemente: and to singe in the way as
he goeth signifyeth goode, to hym which
followeth a wayne or cart: but to singe
in a bayne or hotte house, signifyeth euill
to hym, which so dreameth. And further
to dreame that hee singeth songes in the
market place or streats, to rych men truly
it doth portende dishonestye or rebuke
and derisions: hut to a poore manne thys
dreame signifyeth eyther peuishnes or do

                     •
                  age.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame to
hate a garlande of violettes on his heade
if it be in the season of the yeare for them,
doth portende good happe: but beyng out
of their florishinge tyme and season, it signifyeth
euill. And of those truly whiche
be made wyth whyte violettes, do signifye
manifeste add notable incommodityes,
and those which be made of yeallow
violettes, doe signifye lesse incommodityes
and harmes and those also whiche bee
made of purple violets do signifye death:
For that the purple coulour hath a certayne
agreement to death.
               
                  
And Garlands made of rooses, after the
seasonable tyme of them: do signify good
to al versonnes, except chose beyng sicke
and to those which go aboute to hide thē.
               For those sicke, they slee because rooses
doe lightlye wyther and rotte, and these
whych hyde them they do manifeste, for yt
sauoure and smell. And to weare a garlande
trimmed wythe lyllyes, that they
differ and put of matters vnto a hope.
               And the flowre of Mallowes in a Garlande,
signifyeth good to gardners, and
husbandemē: but to others, it portendeth
labours and wandringe aboute. And the
same significatiō is of Tyme, Sauerye,
and Melilote, excepte to Phisitions, to
whom they portende good, but a Garlād
made of smalach, or els our cōmon parceley,
doth slee sick personnes, and in a wauer
those whiche be vexed with water rū
                  ninge
betweene the skinne and fleshe, for
the coldnes and moysture.
               And a Garlande of waxe signifyeth euill
to all personnes, but especiallye to the
sicke: for asmuche as it is commonlye occupyed
aboute burialls, but those Garlandes
truly which be made of wolle, for



the varietie doo signifie poysons and imprisonment.
And to weare a garlande
of golde, signifieth euell bothe to a poore
man and seruaunte. And to weare a
garland made of the vine & Juie leaues,
dothe portend to some imprisonment and
sicknes also, for the windinges about of
the Juye, but to offendoures of the Law,
it doth portende headinge for that they be
cut of with suche a kind of instrument to
the bignes.
               And hee that thinketh in his dreame
to speake to an aduersarie or enemie and
to kisse eyther doth▪ portende the soluciō
of enmitye betweene them. But to kisse
deade personnes to a person beyng sicke,
it doth portende death.
               Also to a sicke person to haue or weare
on white garmentes, doothe promyse
death, for that deade bodyes, bee caryed
foorth in whyte clothes. And to weare
on a blacke garmente, it doothe promyse
for the more parte, health to a sicke persan
for that not dead personnes, but suche
as mourne for the deade, do vse to be clothed
in blacke. But yet certayne personnes
there were, as well poore men



seruauntes, and prisoners beynge sicke,
that dreamed to bee clothed in blacke,
who notwithstandinge after died. For
very like it was, that those weere not caryed
foorth to burying in whyte, for their
greate pouerty sake. And therfore it may
be sayde, that to be clothed in blacke, is in
a maner euil to al persones. And to haue
on a garmente of dyuers
                     •
                   colours or purple,
doth portende sorrowes or trouble, &
perilles, and reuealeth also hyd secretes:
but to sicke persons, it signifieth to be vexed
by sharp humours, and much choller:
but a purple garment, to rych men, and
seruauntes signifyethe goode: for to the
one it promiseth aduauncemente, estate,
and honoure, and to the other freedome,
and libertye. Also it sleethe the sicke per
                  
                     •
                  on,
and to a poore man it is a daungerous
dreame. Besydes to manye, this
dreame portendeth imprisonmente: for
none lightly weareth on purple but suchas
be in regall authoritye, or in highe offyce.
And to weare on a softe & costlye
garmente, signifyeth goode to ryche and
poore men: for to those, the present dely
                  
                     •
                  es
& wealth shal continue, but to these,



shall be after greater encrease of riches:
but to seruauntes and verye needye persons
this dreame threatneth sicknes.
               Also broken and vncomlye apparell, doe
signifye damage and vnprosperous successe
of doinge matters.
               And besydes hee that thinketh in hys
dreame, to washe his owne or an other
bodyes clothes, do promise the putting
away and delyuerye of some hurte or incommodity
aboute lyfe, For that the clothes
therby: leaue and cast of theyr filthe.
Also it maketh a man to learn and know
hyd matters: for to them, which feare to
be knowen or perceyued, and reproued:
it is daungerous, to cary and see clothes
washed.
               And to stande at a glasse. and to see hys
owne image in the glasse: signifyeth good
both to the man, and woman whiche wil
mary. For the glasse to the mā signifyeth
a wyfe, but the glasse to the woman,
signifyeth a husbande. for asmuche as the
face shewethe or expresseth euen lyke as
these agayne shewe the children, the one
to the other. But yt taketh away sicke
persons, for that the glasse is of earth, of



whatsoeuer matter it shalbe made. And
to see an Image or figure in the Glasse,
vnlyke to hymselfe: doth portende yt some
person to bee named or called, the father
of bastardes or of straunge chyldren.
               But to see an Image, fouler or deformeder
in the Glasse then hymselfe: signifyeth
euill, for that it portendeth sicknesses
and sorrowes or heauines of mynde. And
lyke as also to see: or beholde hymselfe in
the w
                     •
                  ter, doth pronounce death to hym
whiche seeth the dreame, or els to some
most neare or familiar frende to hym.
               And to see the ayre fayre and cleare, promyseth
good to all persons: and especyally
to those which do seke things loste, &
whiche will go into straunge countreys:
for al thinges, in a clere ayre be made apparāt,
but y• ayre darke or darkish or els
cloudy, signifyeth besydes y• hindraūce of
actions sorowes and heauines of mynde.
               And into what matter soeuer, the ayre
shalbe chaunged, is good to them whiche
occupy the fame matter: but 
                     •
                  uto others,
it is euel. And the ayre become quiet, signifyeth
goode to Astronomers alone and
prophecyers. But to others, it geeuethe



a quyet lyfe.
               And rayne to fall without tempest and
much wynde is good to al persons, except
to those whiche be sent to straunge mē or
straungers, for to these it sygnyfyethe
hindraunce. And myslinge rayne,
droppes, and frostes, do siguifye onelye
good to husbandmen, but to others, this
dreame portendeth small gayne and profit.
But showers of rayne and bayle, and
thicke clowdes, and tempestes, doo pronounce
to al personnes, troubles, peryls,
& harmes and hurtes, But to seruauntes
alone, and nedy persons, and those which
be vexed wyth some incommodity & daū
                  ger
do promise the alterations, and delyuery
from the presente euills. For after
greate stormes and tempestes, fayre
weather doth incontinently ensue.
               And for snowe and yse if they be seene in
their proper tyme, they signifye nothing
               For that the sha
                     •
                  pe colde day before

                     ••
                  epe. But
if they be seene out of season, the signify
good to husbandmen, but to others they
pronounce colde attemptes, and p
                     •
                  r
                     •

                     ••
                  t also to go



a iourney. And hayle doothe indicate,
troubles, and heauinesse or sorowes, and
reueleth also hid matters, for yt couloure.
And thonder without lightninge, dooth
portende to seruauntes, troubles, and
wyles to intrap theym vnwares, for the
sodayne vnloked for, but lightninge wyth
out thunder, signifyeth vayne feare. For
after lightning, to loke agayne for thunder,
doth demonstrate the feare, for it is
none other then vayne threatninges. And
therfore when thunder ensueth not, yt
causeth a vayne feare. And further to se
fyre in the skye, cleare pure, and, litle:
doth signify threatnings of some noble estates.
But to many, this dreame portē
                  deth
the incursion of enemyes, pouertye,
& honger. And besides wheresoeuer the
fyre shalbe or where it is carried vp, as
from ye North, South, West, or East, &
from thense enemyes come, or els neare
those regions or countryes, dearth shall
be. But worst of all shalbe, to see fire
to be caryed or shewed openly: & the same
also signifye fyre lyke to torche lyght falling
f
                     •
                  om heauen, also to see wood & burninge
trees, whiche altogether threaten



perill or daunger, aboute his head which
seeth the dreame. And lightninge wythout
tempeste passinge neare by, and not
touchinge the bodye, that person whiche
seeth it shal after bee driuen oute of those
places in whiche hee dwelte. For no man
can sustayne and abyde, the lightenynge
commynge neare hym. But if the lyghtninge,
shal seeme to fal before any, it doth
prohibit hym vtterly to go foorth. And
to be stricken wyth lightninge dooth promyse
to hym whiche lackethe a wyfe, to
marrye one, whether hee be poore, or els
ryche. But beynge maryed, it declareth
the seperation of his wyfe, from hym, &
the lyke also of bretheren, frendes, kynsfolkes,
and acquayntance, to become enemyes
to hym. For lightning doth not
ioin together, but they ioined together in
one it seperateth. And further hauinge
children, it doth depryue or take awaye
children in asmuche as they dye: yf he bee
sicke to this yt hee is smytten wyth lyghtninge,
or otherwyse they fall, if he be not
sicke. For trees wher they be striken wt
lightning they dy & lease their branches.
And lyke as the branches be the children



of the trees, euen soe bee the children the
braunches of men. And a certayne man
there was, who thoughte in his dreame,
that the outward post or pillor of the bed,
was smytten and consumed wyth lyghtening
and not long after dyed his wyfe.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame, to se
vsuall fyer, smal cleare, & soft burninge,
signifyeth good, but to see a much and ouer
greate fyre, doth portende euill.
               Therefore the best fire is that whiche on
the earth is seene to burne pure & cleare,
for this signifyeth muche ric
                     •
                  es: because
a redy fyre in the hearth, is chieflye occupied
about dressing of meates but the same
fyre put out doth threatē pouerty, and
if anye be sicke in that house, it doth pronounce
deathe to him. And good it is to
thinke himselfe to haue Torches or lyke
lightes burninge, and especially thys, to
yonge men. For it signifieth for the more
parte ioyous loues to them, and promyseth
also pleasaunte actions. But to see
hymselfe hauinge one torche, is euill, that
coueteth to hyde hym. And the lanterne
lyght, clear burning in the house, is good
for it signifyeth to all persons, the attayninge



to wealthe and riches, and to those
vnmaryed, it promiseth maryage, and to
sicke persons health. But not cleare burninge
but darkely signifyeth sorrowes, &
heauines of mynd, & sicke persons not lōg
after it fleeth & the lyght put out, it recouereth
and amendeth them for that afterwarde
it shalbe lighted agayn. And any
lanterne light, seene in a barke or shippe,
doth portend after a great quietnesse and
calme of the wind. And further the gates
of the house burning, do signify the death
of the wyse, & his lyfe also to bee in a hasard
or in daūger which seeth the dream.
               And he that thinketh in his dreame, to
se greehoundes huntyng or takyng what,
or already taken, & going out to hunt, signifyeth
good for they be signifyers of the
actiōs but those whiche returne vnto the
cytty or towne, do signify the hyndraunce
of actiōs, for thē they cesse of their labor.
And masty dogs, or others yt onelye kepe
the house, doe signifye the wyues and seruauntes
& other goodes gotten together.
Wherefore they beynge lusty, & fawning
vppon do portēd a good keping of yt house
as well of the wyfe, as of the housholde



the water dyeth.
               And to see greate flyinge byrdes, signifye
more prophet to rich mē thē to the pore.
But the small, and fatt byrdes, be moste
profitable to poore men. And further to se
an Egle sitting on a stone, or tree, or els
in a moste high place, is good to them goinge
foorth to doe a dede, but to suche fearynge
this dreame euill, and a strayer
away also it bryngeth backe agayne.
               And an Egle sittyng on his heade which
seeth the dreame, doth pronoūce death to
hym. For what euer it hath seasoned on
wyth the calons, it sleeth.
               And to be caryed on an Eagle, doothe
promise death, boothe to kynges nobles
of a realme, and rich men. And the Egle
threatninge what, doth signifye the thretninges
of a man of power. But gentle
of loke, & goynge to or greeting what
and callinge in his owne voyce doothe
signify good, as hath bene obserued. And
to see an Egle dead signifyeth onlye good
to a seruaunt and to him whiche feareth
any, for it threatneth both deathe to the
threatner, and to the mayster, and to others,
it signifyeth the hyndraunces of



actions. Also the Egle doth signifye the
presente yeare, for after the difference of
the Egles, bee also iudged the differences,
and dyuers happes to come. And
grippes, bothe to potters, and curryers
of lethers, do portend good, for that they
dwel in the edge of the Town, but to phisitions
and sicke persōs euil, for that they
ioy and feede on dead bodyes.
               Also they signifye wicked and cursed enemyes,
not dwellinge in the towne, and
besydes incommodious to al others. And
the hauke and kyte do sygnyfye vyolente
catchers or takers & robbers of coūters.
For the hauke signify open enemyes, and
openly inuadinge or settynge vppon, and
the kite, dothe portende enemyes pryuyly
settynge on. And the rauen may be
likened to an adnouterer and thefe and
both for the colour, and yt he oftē altereth
his voyce.
               And the crowe, signifyeth much or longe
tyme and the delay of doinge matters.
               And the company of Jayes, doth signifye
both nedy men and vayne trouble. And
woode coluers, and doues, dooe signifye
Women, but the woode Coluers, allwayes



signifye harlotes. And the doues
also do somtymes signify honest women,
and matrones. And doues also do signyfye
delectation in doynge matters, for
that they be dedicated to Venus, and they
be also good to al frendshippes, & feloweshippes,
& all consiliations, for that they
dwell and lyue together. And the companies
of cranes and storkes, if they bee
seene, doe signifye the inuasion and meetynge
of robbers and theues, and the cō
                  mynge
of enemyes. And the swanne, sygnifyethe
a musitiō, and musicke also yt
selfe: and reuealeth hid thinges, for the
coloure. And to sicke personnes beyng
seene, it portendeth health, but harde singinge,
doothe promise deathe, for that the
swanne singeth not, vntill hee bee neare
dying. And bees to husbandmen, and to
those which get a liuinge by them, signifi
good, but to others they prononoce troubles,
for the sound and noyse yt they make
and woundes, for their stinge. Also they
threaten sicknes, for the hounye & waxe.
               And sittinge on the dreamers heade,
to a Captayne of a bande, and to an Emperoure
shalbee, signifyed, good but to others,



euill, and besydes they portend for
the more parte that hee to bee slayne of a
company, or souldiars, whiche seeth the
dreame. For they be lyke to a company
or band. for that they be redy and obey, to
their kinge and Captayne, and to inclose
or shut in bees, signifyeth good, and good
it is also to al personnes to kyl theym excepte
to husbande men only. But waspes
signifie euill to al personnes, for they signifye
that some shal fall into euil and cruell
mens handlinges.
               And yf any saylyng thinketh hymselfe to
sayle well, is goode to al persons, but to
happen or fall sodaynlye into a tempeste,
dooth signifye sorrowes and peryll, but
to come or to make a shippe wreke, or the
shippe ouerthrowen, or rotten, or dryeuen
on stones, is daungerouse to all parsons,
excepte to those whyche bee holden
and kept by force of some, and to seruaū
                  tes,
for those it deliuereth from the daū
                  gers.
For the ship is lyke to them, which
so kepe them. And alwayes it is better to
thinke to sayle in a greate ship and whyche
hath heauye ladynge, for as much as
small shippes, althoughe anye shall sayle



well in them, yet they bringe not goodes
home and to their porte wythout feare.
               And that is also better to thinke to sayle
by the sea, then by lande, for to sayle by
land, doth signifye goodes, the slowelier
and hardliar to come, and that scarcelye
shal come at all. But worser is that any
sayling by sea, doth sodaynly fall or happen
into a tempeste, then if by the lande.
And if any woulde saile and cannot, or
is by force holden or stayed backe by
some doth signifie hindraunces and stayinges
or withholdings of goinges to and
foorth.
               And the lyke so sayle by lande, trees and
stones beynge layde agaynste and in the
middle sette, doth signifie witholdinges
or stayings backe and hindraunces.
               But to see barkes sayling from the shore
and lande on the sea or wel perfourming
their course, is good to al personnes, and
bothe a signifier of wandringe, & returne
home from some straunge countreys.
               And also it pronounceth, messages messengers
by sea, and Shippes or barkes
brought oute of the hauen vnto an highe
place do make goods the 
                     •
                  lower to come,



for then truly they begin saylynge. But
of an highe place, and the barkes into an
Hauen returninge and arryuinge, do signifye
goodes the sooner to come, for then
they shall come to an end of saylinge.
               And the hauens, doe alwayes signifye
well doers and frendes, and all those also
which bee Artificiall practisers. And
the anchors vses, do signifye necess
                     •
                  tye &
safetye and prohibite to wander foorth.
               And the mast of the shippe, signifyeth the
master of the shippe or house, and the fore
part of the shippe, signifyeth the ruler of
the foorshipe or becke. But a shippe performinge
his course, and not resting, doth
portende verye great perill to bee aboute
the selfe same part, and the shippe brused
or thrust together by a violent tempest.
               And from whence soeuer fyet is caryed
into the ship, from thence it foorsheweth
the tempest to come.
               And the sunne from the East rising vp
cleare and fayre, & settinge the lyke in the
Weste, is goode to all personnes, and to
others also it portendeth actions, and to
others the generation of children. But
hurteth those, whiche go
                     •
                   aboute to hide



themselfe, for it reuealeth and bringeth
to light al thinges. And the Sonne oute
of the West arysinge, reueyleth hid thinges,
and of those whiche they thought to
hid themselfe, and the sicke person verye
lowe broughte it recouereth and amendeth,
& the person beynge dimme of sight
not to bee blynd it promiseth, for of much
darcknesse he shal se light. And 
                     ••
                  bringeth
again the persō dwelling in a strāge
countrey although hee bee in hope neuer
to be. Also good it is to him which hath
purposed to go Westwarde, for it promiseth
returne to hym from thence. And to
hym whiche loketh for any to come frō yt
West, it signifyeth that hee is then ready
to returne and come. And to others it is
contrarye, to euerye attempte and hope,
and that which we haue purposed it letteth
to be done or ended.
               And the Sunne darcke or somwhat
bloudy for heate makyng a noyse, is euil
and harme to all personnes, partelye indicating
hindrances of actions, and partlye
to the dreamer, it portendeth sicknes
or otherwyse peril, or els sickenes or disease
in his eyes.
               
                  
And to those whiche will hide what, and
to persons also fearing is obserued profitable,
for the twone shal well hidde, and
the others shall suffer or sufteyne no euil
and harme. For the Sunne darke, doth
the lesse b
                     ••
                  ne. And it is alwayes better
to se the light & brightnes of the Sunn,
entringe into the house, then to see the
Sunne it selfe, for the light, because it
maketh the house the lighter, it p
                     •••
                  endeth
the attayning of goods. And further
the sunne thoughte to be apparelled
like a Carter, is good to warriours, and
to those whiche couet to wāder abrode, &
to Carters, but to sicke personnes, it ys
petillous and daungerous.
               And the Moone signifyeth the wyfe of
the dreamer, & the mother also for nourse
shee is thought to be: and both daughter
and sister. For when any thinketh to see
his own Image or shadow in the Mone,
to hym trulye whiche hath no children, it
portendeth to him the byrth of a Sunne,
but to the woman so dreaminge, it portē
                  deth
the byrth of a daughter. For euery
one perceyueth y• like Image of hymselfe

                     〈…〉
                   daughter.
               
                  
And this dreame is good to keepers of
bankes of money & vsurers, for they shall
after attayne muche gaine and profitte &
good it is also to them whiche woulde be
seene, but parsonnes hidde it reuayleth.
But parsonnes beinge sicke, and sayling
ou the sea, it sleeth, and those truly being
vexed with a sickenesse of water runnig
betweene the skinne and the fleshe, for asmuch
as the nature is moist, but these to
fal and come vnto shypwrake. And what
good thinges the Sunne promisethe, the
same also the Moone signifyeth, and the
like what euilles, but yet the euilles alwayes
lesser, for that she is lesser of heate
then the Sunne. The starres seene all
cleare and fayre, signifieth good vnto such
ion
                     •
                  neyinge and vnto other accions, and
vnto secrets. For these shew not the lyke
which the Sunne and Moone do, for that
these shewe the brighter and fayrer they
beynge not aboue the earth, and the dimmer
& darcker when eyther is aboue the
earth: For that euerye starre is knowen
priuatelye, eyther by his couloure, bignes,
motion, or forme of motion. And now
eche starre, dothe cause lyke happe accordinge



to his fortitude, whiche when they
appeare troubled, do then signifye sorrowes,
and both perilles & troubles to the
dreamer. But appearing bright & fayre
do then promise a happynes, prosperitye,
and good encrease to the dreamer.
               The starres seene to fall from heauer, do
threaten to riche men muche pouertye &
sorrowe to ensue for that heauen, is applyed
to the house of the dreamer, and the
starres to the possessions, riches and men
in the house. But this dreame to the pore
foresheweth destructiō. And one thought
that he saw all the starres fall from heauen,
after whiche ensued that he became
wholly balde: For lyke reason as heauen
hath to al the earthe, euen the same hath
the head to the bodye. And agayne, what
reason the starres haue to heauen, & the
same haue the heares to the heade. So yt
the starres neyther fallinge on the earth
nor darcke appearinge do promise good.
But rather forshewe daunger and hurte
to many persons. And euill it is to see
the starres vnder the rooffe of an house
for that it signifyeth the house to become
destitute, vncouered and burned, or els yt


                  
the Maister of the house shal dye, in that
the starres appeared within the house.
               The raynbowe seue of the dreamer on
the ryghte syde, promiseth good to hym,
but seeue on the left side, threatneth euil.
But this right and lefte side, is not hearement
as to heauen, but as to the Sunne.
And howsoeuer it shall appeare, yet it
alwayes signifyeth good to those in great
pouertye or in any misfortune. For that
such in decaye, and oppress
                     •
                  d wyth any calamitye,
shal after amende of their estate.
               The white cloudes be signifyers of a
happier estate, and drawinge from the
earth vpwarde towarde heauen do signifye
for the more part a long iourney: and
that suche lying out of their proper coū
                  treye,,
shal after returne home, and that
secretes to be reueyled. But the yealowe
cloudes seene do signify an vnprosperous

                     •
                  uccesse of matter. And darke clowdes
seene, do signifye sorrowes, and cares to
ensue: but the blacke cloudes seene, doe
threaten a tempest, or heauines to ensue.
To thincke hym selfe to be deade, & that
caryed forth, and buried, to a seruaunte,
to whom the affayres and house of the



Maister is not committed, it sygnifieth
libertie. For that the deade beinge a seruaunce,
hath then no maister, and findeth
at that tyme the rest bothe of laboures &
seruice. But to that seruaunt to whō the
goodes of the maister are cōmitted, death
taketh away that credite. And to a mā
not hauinge a wyfe, it forshewethe Mariage
to ensue. For that mariages and
death, be thoughte both as the endes to
men, and do alwayes shewe a lyke together.
So that to sicke personnes to marry
a wyfe, and to keepe the Brydale, signifieth
deathe to ensue. For that the same
happen to both, in that feastes be kept as
well at the Burialles, as at the Marriages.
And to that manne dreaminge the
lyke, whiche hath a wyfe that he shall after
dye, leauinge both brethren, & kinsefolke.
For that the deade doe not after
keepe company with the liuinge, nor the
liuinge with the deade: But this dreame
signifyeth good to the well learned, and
fathers. For that to the fathers, chyldren,
and to the learned, the wrytinges, &
Bookes of their wisedome.
               
                  
And this hath beene obserued, that to the
sadde, and such in feare, that death signified
good to them. For that the deade be
then free both of fear, and heauines. And
this dreame to them, which he in a cōtrouersie
for lande and woulde buye lande,
signifyeth a good successe. For that the
Lordes of suche lande are dead. But in
other variances to dreame to be dead, signifyeth
losse and sorrow For yt in causing
and workynge matters, the dead be then
vnhable to doe, besydes are fallen in the
power of the liuinge. But if anye beeinge
sicke seemeth to be deade, doth after
signifye that he shalbe deliuered from the
sickenesse or griefe, for that the deade do
not then feele griefe: nor be sicke. And if
rny thinketh to be buried aliue, the same
promiseth good to no body, for that it signifyeth
for the more yarte imprisonment
or to be fettered wyth chaynes. And hee
that thinketh to be strangled and to hang
himselfe, signifyeth after tribulations &
sorrowes for that to them that are strangeld,
we se the lyke to happen. And if the
dead seeme meerye and gentle they signifye
good, & that he shal passe the present



tyme luckely: But if not, then contrarywyse.
And if the deade seemeth to take
away such thing, which he enioyed in his
lyfe tyme, promiseth euil to follow. But
most daungerous of all others are these,
whiche seeme to take awaye garmentes,
money, or meate: For they eyther signifye
death to the dreamer or to some of
hys kyndred or acquaintance. Besides if
the deade seeme to giue somwhat, do also
signify euill: vnlesse they s
                     •
                  me to geue
meate, siluer, or garmentes.
               And if any thinketh to digge vp treasure,
findinge there litle stoare of money,
dooth signifye the lesser harme or euill to
ensue: but seeminge a treasure of muche
money doth signifye sorrowes and cares,
and foresheweth death, for that Treasure
is not founde, wythout the digging vp of
the earth, nor the dead layed into it wtout
the openinge of the earthe.
               And this for a trueth hath bene obserued,
that when a certayne personne was
sometymes in heauines, thought in flepe
that hee saw himselfe to haue very small
moneye in a litle basket, and that hee entered
into a certaine shop, wher thought,



he lost the same coine conueyed by thefte.
After whiche followed, yt certayne lucky
tydinges came to him the same daye followinge,
of matters which he toke great
care for, and through the same was delyuered,
and became meerye agayne. And
an other whiche sent his sonne somtimes
out of his countreye to gather vp money,
and beyng then not come home, thought
in sleepe that he was returned, and sayde
to him: I haue brought thee home three
Thousande and 80. Crownes, who awakyng,
shewed this dreame vnto 
                     •
                  n interpreter,
whoe answeared that his Sonne
shoulde shortlye returne with losse of hys
money which the lyke happened to him
               To mary a mayden signifyeth death
to the sick parson, for that lyke things be
vsed in mariage, as happely in the Burial:
yet the same signifyeth good to him
which purposeth to go a newe iourney &
message, for that it signifyeth he shall attayne
his purpose. And to that person hopynge
after any thing of commodity, shal
after attaine the same. For yt some profit
doth alwayes ensue, at the newe marr
                     •
                  ing
of a wife. And yet to some parsons,



this dreame signifieth troubles & shame,
for that maryages are not perfourmed,
without trouble. And if anye thinketh to
marye a wydowe, shall after compasse no
ne
                     •
                  e, but some olde busines, wythoute
care and trouble. But if any shall thinck
to see hys wyfe maried to another man,
doth after signifye the alteration of actions,
or seperation. And if a woman hauinge
a husbande seemeth to be marryed
vnto another man, lyke as
many wryte, doth after signify
that she shal eyther bury
her husbād, or other
wyse in some maner
shal be seperated,
& liue frō him.
Yet this not
alwayes happeneth true.
            
         
         
            
            Certain briefe Dreames

               IF a Prynce or his wyfe
shal seeme to haue ringes
on the fingers, declare after
so manye parsons sonnes
as ther appeared ringes.
To talke with the earth, signifieth
to Princes victory. If it seme to a Prince
to haue receyued poysoned drinke, or
meate, that his heares seme to fal of: shal
after ouercome ennemyes by pollicie.
            If it seeme to a Prince to plucke vp anye
trees by the roote, that he shall subdewe
some of his nobles. But if those trees fal
of their owne accorde, then those nobles
shall dye without trespasse or facte of the
Prince. If from the foote of Trees shippes
seeme to aryse then the Princes people
shal encrease.
            If a Prince seemeth to haue the Sunne



in his hande, signifyeth that he shall haue

hoped after. To a priuate sicke parsō,

but to a Prince death. A riche pompe or
tryumph to a Prince sick declareth death
but to a priuate man, the deliuerye frome
that sickenesse. To a person in dignity to
