               HArry who ball harke, maſt Camell hath yzeene
               Thy vengeance zory bill, and thompes the as I wene,
               And is by Chriſt full zad, that thou comeſt out zo late,
               Thou mighteſt haue had a place vor Pekehorn at his gate
               But vortune frended not, chote it very well,
               The more harde happe thou hadſt, ich doo the plainly tell.
               Vor zure charde hym ſweare, by gogs digne daintie bones,
               Thou ſhoods be newe iſhod, to trample theſe olde ſtones,
               And weſtwardes ſhodſt haue zit, for blearyng of thyn eies.
               Vor zommer nowe a teowes, will hurt the zore with flies,
               But he no nyggon is, a wyll vorde the a flappe,
               Thou ſhalt haue a voxtayle man, to put vpon thy cappe,
               And goddes beniſon to, tho Churcharde tye hym ſhorte,
               Churchard weares a bel ats tail to make his frendes ſport,
               And Camell choppes holy water, for Churcharde & for the,
               Vor he wyll to you bothe, a holy chaplayn be.
               And if a vittin not, er twaie daies bee agoe,
               He wyll you ſprinkle bothe, as varre as I doo knowe.
               Tis a vengeance beaſt, and bygge to beare you all,
               And if you zit not vaſt, bum faie, map to vall.
            
            
               Thomas Camell.
