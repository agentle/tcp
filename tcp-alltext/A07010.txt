               ALthough we haue mooste vrgent & weyghty causes, yea & those īnumerable to extoll, magnify, commend & prayse the exceadynge goodnes & bounteous liberalite of our moost mercifull father, yf we perpend, pē
               sitate, weyghe, ponder & cōsider his inestimable benefites, which he frely & without our deseruynge dayely giueth vnto vs miserable creatures, yet if we weyghe all thinges in a iust balaunce, we shall easely and withoute ony difficulte perceaue, y• we are moost bounde to celebrate & prayse his moost blyssed name for ye restorynge of his holy word at this

tyme, brought to passe by his true annoynted Hēry our moost redoubted Kynge, as by another Iosias, whose graces moste excellent maieste that LORDE of powers mought prosper in all his diuine affayres & godly enterprises. For before God restored to the world the Gospell & ioyfull tydynges of his derely beloued sonne our LORDE & Sauioure Iesus Christe, incredulite as chefe rulare reygned in oure hertes, Hypocrisye as a vayne gloryous Empresse, bare dominion, Supersticiō, Idolatry, false sectes, mennes tradicions, confidence reposed in humayne inuencions, Pylgrimages, Offringes, Bulles, Pardonnes, dispensacions, Masses of Scala celi, marchaundyse for merytes & workes, byenge & sellynge of the diuine misteries, with an whole sea of euelles mo, had creapte in, vnto ye great perturbacion & disquietnes of ye holy

catholyke chyrch, as I may passe ouer the blynde ignorancy & ygnorant blyndenes, into the whiche by this meanes we were cast and tombled. Howe can it otherwyse be? If the lyght of Gods word be obscured extincte or quenched,Psal. cxviii which only is the lanterne to our feete, & a lyghte to our pathwayes, what meruayle is it, though the fearce & outerageous floudes of Idolatry & all kinde of supersticiō breake in and inuade the boundes of christianite, yea and ouerflowe thē. For as Fayth, Hope Charite, Peace, Mercy, Pacience, longe sufferynge, humilite, sobriete iustice, spirituall liberte, obedience towarde the hyghe powers, and all goodnes reygneth, where the LORDES word bereth rule, so in lyke mā

Agayne, whan the preachyng of Gods word

If they speke not accordynge to this word, they shall not haue the mornynge lyght, that is to saye, the true knowledge of God.Marke. xii. Rebuked not Christ ye Saduces, bycause they were ignorant in the holy Scriptures, affyrming that they were deceaued for lacke of the knoweledge of them? Ye are

deceaued, sayth he, bicause ye know not ye scriptures. Therfore in ye gospel of Iohn,Ioan. v. he exhorteth al men to serch ye scriptures, sayēg, serch ye ye scriptures, for they are they ye beare witnes of me. And ye Psalmograph calleth thē blissed,Psal. cxviii and .i. which search ye testimonies of the LORDE & meditate in his lawe both both daye & nyght The worde of God muste nedes be an excellent & precious treasure, seinge it is the power of GOD vnto saluacion for so many as beleue,Roma. i. i. Tim. iiii. seinge also it is profitable to teache, to īproue, to amend, & to instructe, in ryghteousnesse, that the man of God may be perfecte & prepared to all good workes. Who is able to expresse, what a precious relique and high treasure the worde of God is? Uerely it is that treasure, wherof Christ speaketh in the Gospell,Math. xii
                     •
                  
                that lygheth hydden in the felde, which, whan a man once fyndethe, for ioye

therof he goeth & selleth all that he hathe, & byethe that felde. And it is no lesse treasure to the soule, than the corporall eyes are to the bodye, as ye Psalmographe testifieth: Thy worde,Psal. cxviii O LORDE, is a lanterne to my fete, & a lyght to my pathewayes. For as that man, that is depryued of his corporal syght, knoweth not how nor wher to walke, so lyke wyse, hē that wanteth the lyght of Goddes worde seeth nothynge, and therfore walketh he not aright but wādreth abrode lyke a shepe dispersed & destitute of a shepparde.Mathew. ix But as he that hath the true & perfecte syght of the eyes stōblethe not, but walketh at all times without daū
               ger, so in lyke māner he ye is endued by Christes spirite wt the light of y• holy Scriptures wādreth not frō that true way, which sayth of him selfe,Ioan. xiiii. I am the waye, the truethe & the lyfe, but alwaye is preserued,

that he walketh continually in the kynges hygh waye, declynyng neither on the right hand or on ye lyfte hand. He is not caryed about with straūg doctryne.Deut. xii. Hebre. xiii. Math. xvi. Math. vii. Luke. vi. His fayth is bylte on a sure rocke, therfore abideth he fyrme, immutable, stedfaste, sure & constant, what so euer kynde of tē
               peste assaylethe hym. The gates of hell can not preuayle agaynst him. Satan with all his army are not able once to abduce & remoue hym from the true waye.ii. Petre. i. For the lyghte of Goddes worde is continually before his eies, wher vnto he gyueth diligent attendance, which also he followeth earnestly in all his iourneyes, and therfore muste he nedes walke the true waye, & neuer erre. Yf he be blyssed, fortunate & happy that hath the naturall lyght of his body, howe much more blyssed & heuēly at ease is he, that is illumined with ye lyght of the LORDES word?

wherof ye holy king Dauid hauīge experience prayeth on this māner, open myne eyes,Psal. cxviii & I shall consyder ye meruelous thynges of thy lawe. To walke in this lyght, Christe exhorteth vs, sayeng, walke whyle ye haue lyght,Ioan. xii. vnles ye darkenes come on you. He that walkethe in darkenes, wotteth not whither he gothe. Whyle ye haue lyght, beleue on the lyghte, that ye maye be the chyldrē of lyghte. So many as be of God, loue this lyght of y• 
               LORDES word, and desyre with all theyr herte to walke ī it. But they that be of Satan, hate it, & refuse to walke in it. Why so?Actum. vii. Uerely for they are beast lyke mynded, styffe necked, & in all thynges resist the holy Ghost. The lyght they hate, be it neuer so pleasaunt & wholesome, but the darkenes they enhalse, loue, kysse & kull, be it neuer so tedious and horrible. Therfore shall they receaue y• greater

dānacion, as Christ wytnesseth sayeng
                  •
               , thys is the condemnacion that lyght came into the worlde, & men loued darkenes rather then lyght. For theyr workes were euel.Ioan. iii. Euery one that doth euell, hate the the lyght, neyther commeth he to ye lyght, vnles his workes shoulde be reproued. O howe blessed are they, to whome it is gyuen to walke in thys lyght. Agayne, howe miserable, wretched & vnhappy are they, y• speare theyr eyes at the commynge of this confortable light, & wyl not only not walke in it thē selues, but also laboure to the vttermooste of theyr power to obscure & quenche it, that it maye appeare & shyne to none at all. These are those people,Esaie. xxx. whiche, as the Prophet saythe, prouoke God to anger. Theise are the lyenge and vnfaythefull chyldren. Theyse are the chyldren that wyll not heare the lawe of the LORDE.
               
These are they, which say to them that se, se not, & to them that looke, looke not for vs those thinges that are right. Speke vnto vs pleasaūt thīges, preach vnto vs tales of Robyn hood, take awaye from vs the right way, go out of the pathe, and away with that holy one of Israel frō our face. Theise are they, which hate hym,Amos. v. that reproueth thē openly, and abhore hym that telleth the truethe playnely. Theise are they, which call euell good,Esaie. v. & good euell, darkenes lyght, & lyght darkenes. bytter swete, & swete bitter. These are they whiche are wyse in theyr owne eyes, and stonde wel in theyr owne cōceate. But agaynst all such as contemne the holy scriptures & cast awaye the law of theyr LORDE God, wyllynge neither to enter thē selues, nor yet suffryng other, christ intonateth and thōderethe on this māner,Luke. xii. wo be to you lawers, for ye

haue taken awaye the key of knowledge, ye haue not onlye not entred in, but ye haue also forbidden them that entend to enter. But without doubte they shal no lēger preuayle.Iob. xv. Esaie. xi. Daniel. viii ii. Thess. ii. For ye daye of the LORDE is at hand whan he shall breake Satans head & destroye bothe him & all his ministers with the breath of his mouth For he wyll no lenger sufferre thys great wickednes & hygh abhominacion. He wyll be knowne for ye God & Sauiour alone. He is that LORD which alone wyll be exalted,Esaie. ii. and all Idolles shall be vtterlye broken on peces. He is that God, whiche wyll no lenger suffer his glorye to be attributed & gyuen to other.Esaie. xiii. Iacob. ii. He is ye lawer, which wyl expulse the darkenesses of mennes tradicions, that fyghte with his infallible verite, & brynge in the glorious lyght of his moost holye worde. To be shorte, he wyll detecte and ouerthrowe all the

Idols, that obscure his glory, and set vp his blyssed name to be praysed and magnyefyed for euer and euer. So be it.
            Of this thynge haue we experience euen at this tyme, in ye whiche that LORDE of puissāce hath moost puissantly by his derely beloued seruant Henry our moost vertuous & godlye Kynge, subuerted, topledde downe, and ouerthrowne a great parte of Antechristes kyngedome, so that by his diuine polecy & godlye enterpryse,Apoca. xvii. that great whore of Babylon, the mother of all whore dome & abhominacions of the erth, hath loste her chefe glory & renome, & is nowe become so vile, that she is euen made the habitacion of diuelles, & the holde of all fowle spirites & a cage of all vncleane & hatefull byrdes.Apoca. xviii So that no man nowe wyl once by ony of her m

Neyther cā this prophecy of Christ be made frustrate by ony humayne polecy:Math. xv. Euery plante, that my heauenly father hath not planted, shall be plucked vp by ye rootes.

               iii. Reg. iii. ii. Para. ix.The Scriptures shewe howe yt in ye tyme of kyng Salomon, there was so great plēte of syluer at Ierusalem, as there was of stones in the stretes. What carnall manne would not haue delyghted to inhabite hymselfe there? Yet verely in my iudgement we do farre excell ye glorious abundans of Salomon & all hys in mundane treasures, to whome it is gyuen not only to florysh with worldely goodes, but also wyth the incomparable treasures of the spirite. So that our condicion at this present doth not a lytle excede & passe the state of those Israelites, which lyued so gloriously vnder the empyre and dominion of

Salomon. Certes as concernynge my selfe, let God be but a lytle mercifull vnto me, yf I had not rather chose to lyue vnder this our moost Christen kynge withe that lytle nothinge that I haue, & to enioye the benefyte of Goddes worde, than to li

And I doubte not, but that of this opinion are so many as tender the glory of God & the helthe of theyr owne soules. Nowe seynge ye this incōparable treasure & inestimable benefite of Gods word, is so bounteously gyuen vnto vs, let vs all togyther consent wt one mynde to cōserue & mayntayne this moste precious Iewel, that we lose it not hereafter thorowe our owne necligence.

Let vs further the buyldynge so muche as we maye, and not hynder it by ony meanes, vnlesse we be cursed of God. Let vs cast our mony togyther euerye man for hys porcion to the makinge of this glorious temple, that the name of God may be praysed in it of the faythfull for euermore.Luke. xii. Yf we be not able with the rytche man to cast great abūdans of goodes in to the treasure house, yet let vs wt the poore widowe of the Gospell at the leest gyue two minutes, & God wyll surely approue & accepte oure

O lamentable case. And what shall I saye of the manifold & straunge fasshions of the garmentes, that are vsed nowe a dayes? I

thīke Satan studieth not so much to inuent newe fasshyons to bryng christen men into his snare,Mark wel. as the Taylours nowe a dayes are cōpelled to excogitate, inuēt & ymagyne diuersities of fasshyōs for apparel, that they maye satisfy the foolyshe desyre of certayne lyghte braynes & wylde Otes, which are all togither gyuen to newe fanglenes.

But surely this Hethenysh & vayne garnysshyng of our body engraffeth high Pryde in vs, wherby it cōmethe to passe, that Humilite is clene exiled & putte to-flyght.

                  Thyrdly after we be renewed by the mooste blyssed Sacramente of Baptisme & the holy Ghost,Of synne after Baptysme remember howe sone ye loose agayne that benefites thorow your owne sinne & wickednes, which before ye freely obtayned by Christ. This shall also moue you to cast awaye all pryde & to be humble, lowely & meke, in the syght of God, euer lamētynge your misery, & flyenge continually vnto God with youre feruēt prayers for grace, mercy, fauour & remission of your synnes, vnlesse ye be dampned

It shal also not a lytyl profyt, to remember the paynes of hel, whiche are prepared for them that are proud & disobedient to the wyll of God.Of vertues & qualities. Fourthly yf at ony tyme ye desyre of vayne glory shall crepe in to your bosome for the excellencye of vertues and qualities wherewt ye are endewedde, call streyght vnto youre remembraunce thys sayenge of the Apostle, what hast thou that thou haste not taken? If thou haste taken it,i. Cor. iiii. why doste yu reioyse, as though thou haddest not taken it? & this shall plucke downe youre combe, as they vse to saye. For who is so madde,Note. excepte he be lyke vnto the Crow of Esope, to bost himselfe of other mennes fethers? The gyftes that we haue, be they neuer so excellente, are not ours but Gods. He maye take them awaye agayne whā it pleseth hym. Thefore ought

So that we haue no cause to be proude of them, but rather the more humble, and lowly in herte.
                  Finally in all your workes, seme they neuer so good and perfecte, yet thyncke you, yt they are nowe done wt so much purite & clennes of hert as they ought, & therfore ye muste humbly graunt your imperfecciō, & desyre god to fulfil that which lackethe in you for hys Sonne Iesus Christes sake.

outwardely pretend humilite, and inwardely be inflated wythe Pharasaicall arrogancy, & puffed vp after the manner of the proud Hypocrites, and supercibious Pharises,Mat. xxiii. whom Christ & his Apostles rebuke so oft in ye holy scriptures for theyr fayned holynes. Be no paynted sepulchres, outwardely fayre, and inwardly full of rotten bones, and al fylthynes. For many,Ep. xxvii. as saynt Ierome sayth, followe the shadowe of Humilite, but fewe the trueth. Let all glosyng wordes be taken away, let all faynynge gestures cease. Pacience sheweth a mā to be truly hū

Without thys innocēcy & purite of lyfe,Deut. xiii. I se not what al fayth, fear or loue profyt. Followe your LORDE God, sayth Moses, feare hym & kepe hys cōmaūdementes, & heare his voyce,Miche. vi. ye shall serue hym and cleaue vnto hī.

loue of god in dede, but if it ceaseth to worke, than it is no loue.Chrisostom Chrysostome also saythe. The sonnes of GOD are not content to syt ydle, but the spirite prouokethe them to take some great and commendable worke in hand. Uerely as impossible as it is for a good tre tobe wtout a good fruyte, whā the tyme of the yeare cometh,Note thys similitude. so impossible is it for true fayth to be wythout good and christen workes. And as the spirite of God can none otherwyse but do those thynges, that are pleasaūt before God, so in lyke māner a faythful mā, which is the son of god, can not cease frō workyng ye wyl of god.

And he that beleueth in me, as the scripture sayth, floudes of lyuysh water shall flow out of his bely. Euery good tree bryngeth forth good fruyte. He yt hath not a lust & feruent desyre to worke the wyll of God, and to fasshon his lyfe in all partyes accordyng to the holy law of God, vndoubtedly he hath not y• christen fayth, neyther pertayneth he vnto Christe, though he bablethe neuer so muche of faythe,i. Cor. iiii. of God, of Christ, & of all the diuine misteries. For the kyngdome of God is not in word,Mat. vii. Luke. vi. Luke. xiii. but in power. Not euery one that sayth vnto me, LORDE, LORDE sayth Christ, shall enter into ye kingdome of heauen, but he that doth y• wyll of my father, whiche is in heauen. Many shall saye vnto me, at y• daye, LORDE, LORDE, haue not we prophecyed in thy name, & cast out

dyuels by thy name,Psal. vi. Luke. vi. Ioan. xiiii. and wrought miracles by thy name? But than shal I saye vnto them I know you not. Departe from me ye workers of iniquite. He that hathe my commaundementes & kepethe them, he it is yt loueth me. If ony mā loueth me, he wyl kepe my worde, & my father wyll loue hym, & we wyl come vnto hym, & dwell with hym. But he that loueth me not, kepethe not my wordes. God hathe not shewed to vs his manifolde kyndnes, that we should lyue dissolutely and with oute all good order (for so were we vnworthy ony kyndenes at all) but that we should earnestly & wyth all diligence ēploy our selues to worke his wyl, to satisfy so much as lyeth in our power his godly mynd,i. Ioan. ii. Rom. viii. and to walke in all our conuersacion & lyuynge, as his derely beloued son w alked. If he dyd not spare his only begotten Sonne, but gaue hym

for vs all euen vnto the death, how vnkynde creatures myght we righteously be recounted, if we shoulde not study with herty myndes to accomplysshe his holy preceptes? Are they worthye to be called chyldren,Ioan. iii. which neglecte theyr fathers wyll, & so greatly dissent from theyr Fathers manners?Chyldren oughte to follow ye mā

Our celestiall father is good, godlye, mercyfull, pacient, & all spirite, & shall we his chyldren be euell, wycked, rygorous, impacient, & all flesshe? Be ye holy, saythe he, for I am holy. Certes god hath not called vs vnto vncleannes,Leuit. ix. i. Thes. iiii. but vnto sanctificacion. Nether hath he delyuered vs from Satan & his army, that we should lyue wyckedly, but practyse pure ī

                  Thus se ye that if we wyl walke before God,Tit. iii. we maye not onlye beleue in God, feare & loue God, but also lead a pure & innocent lyfe, be plēteous in good workes, & altogither studious of tru godlines.

It is one degre of vertu to loue my neyghbour, but it is an higher degre to loue myne enemy, but the moost excellēt degre aboue all, is so to loue oure verye enemyes, that we can be contented not only to do them good, but also euē to gyue our lyues to wynne them vnto

                  Wel sayd. Althogh neighbours I do not doubte, but that in your conscience, ye are assuredly perswaded, that the christen magistrates and hyghe powers do reygne, rule, & haue dominion, euery one in theyr kyngedome, not of theyr owne tyrannye, cruell violence and extorte power, butte of the authorite of Gods worde, & the iust appoyntment of the hygh celestiall kyng for the great consolacion and cōforte of his people, and for the innumerable cōmodities of the Christen publique weale, which of theyr no lesse vertuous than ryghteous regiment & gouernaunce do ensue, yet for asmuch as in these our dayes there haue rysen vp wicked & vngodly spirites which deny the office of the magistrates & hyghe powers to be the ordinance of God,The Anabaptistes. and affirme yt it can by no meanes stonde

with the Gospell of Christe. I wyll fyrst declare vnto you & proue by ye holy scriptures, that the hygh powers are ordined of GOD,The contentes of thys floure. and that theyr office agre and in all poyntes consent with the moost holy worde of God, yea and that it is so necessary that withoute this regimēt and gouernaunce of the hyghe powers, no publique weale can remayne in safe estate, no frendshyppe canne be mayntayned,Mark well. no fayth can be regarded, no order cā be kepte, no propriete of goodes can be saued, no vertu can reigne, no tranquilite cā cō
                     sist, nor ony goodnes continue, but all must nedes growe out of order, and, as they saye, go to hauocke, vnto the great disquietnes and vtter destruccion of so many as dwell in suche wyld, rustical, brutall & beast lyke realme, wher no ciuilite of publique order in mundayne thynges is obserued. This once done, I wyll

declare, what your duty is toward oure moost soueraygne LORDE the kyng, and all the other rulers that gouerne vnder his dominion, that ye maye lyue in thys mooste florysshynge Realme lyke true and faythfull subiectes with obedient hertes and that not onlye for feare but for cōsciēce sake, that by this meanes ye maye both acquyre & get to your selues quietnes & rest, leadynge an honeste and peasable lyfe withoute ony disturbance, and also be an exā
                     ple to other, that they wt lyke obedience maye be subiecte & serue our moost christen Prince accordyng to the wyll of God.
                  To shewe that the authorite of ye magistrates & common officers is the ordinaūce of God, wherof maye I rather take a begynnynge, than of the publique weale of the Israelites? Whan God by his extent puissaunce & stretched oute power had

delyuered the people of Israel oute of theyr miserable seruitude, wherwith they were greuously oppressed of the cruel and lyonlyke Tyraunt Pharao, dyd he not appoynte Moses to be theyr ruler,Exo. xiii. gyde, captaine & gouernour, that he hauynge the preeminence & rule ouer thē, should safe cōduite thē, rule & gouerne thē after the wyll of God? Woulde he haue done this, if it had bene a thīg vniust, vnmete & vnlawful? Would he not rather haue suffered his people to runne astraye as masterlesse hoūdes and as sheepe destitute of a sheppard or herdman without ony order? Dyd not Ietro also, a mā of great vertu,Exo. xviii. and replete with ye holy Ghoste, whan he sawe Moses alone take all the paynes in hearing the causes of the Israelites from mornynge vntyll euen, saye to hym these wordes? Looke out among al thy people suche as be wyse men, &

that feare GOD, and suche as are true, and hate couetousnesse. Make these rulars ouer thē, some ouer thousandes, some ouer hūdredes, ouer fyftye, and ouer ten, that they maye alway iudge the people. Moses so dyd, & God approued his acte. Here se we other magistrates & rulers appoynted also to serue in the publique weale besydes ye heade officer, which they also beynge lawfully chosen and set in office, are approued before God.Deu. xxviii After Moses were not Iosue, Othoniel, Aioth, Sāgar, Delbora, Gedeon, Abimelech, Thola, Iayr, Iepte, Samson, & at the last Samuel, Iudges and rulers ouer the Israelites? Ware not all these approued to be ye iuste and lawful ministers of God. Dyd not Moyses also before his deathe shewe to the people of Israell, that afterwarde God should gyue them a kinge of the nomber of theyr brothers,

which should be theyr rulers as all nacions haue thorowe out al the worlde? Do we not here learne that all Nacions at that tyme had kynges, & that kynges are appoynted & chosen by the eleccion of god?

For as it is theyr office to rule, so is it our duety to obey, & that not faynedly but with sincerite of cōsciēce & purenes of mynde wythoute ony dissimulacion or Hypocrysy.Note. 
                     For ther is no povver but of God.

Butte I praye you marke, what your floure sayth, Let euery soule be obedience to the povvers that beare rule. Note that it is sayd, Let euery soule be obediēt. Here se you, that no parson, be he spiritual or temporal, as they vse to call them, is excepted from obedience towarde the hyghe powers.No parson is excepted from obedience vnto ye powers. All are vnder subieccion. All owe obedience, feare, honoure & tribute to the rulers of the commō weale. None is free from this subieccion. For euery soule is here takē after the Hebrew phrase for all mē, & for so many as are reasonable creatures,

                  Theo.
                  What is that I pray you?

                  Uerely, trybute. For this causealso, sayth S. Paule,Rom. xiii. must ye pay tribute. For they are Gods ministers which mayntayne the same defēce. Gyue therfore to euery man his duty, trybute to whome tribute belō
                     geth, custome to whome custome is due, feare to whom feare belōgeth,

honoure to whome honour pertayneth.
               
               
                  Chri.
                  I pray you, what meane ye by this worde, tribute?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  By tribute I vnderstand all paymentes that are due to the ciuile magistrates,What is ment by this worde tribute. as tenthes, fyftenes, rētes, taskes, subsidies, customes. &c. All these are we bounde by Gods commaundement to paye without ony tumulte or grudgynge, & that not wythout a cause.Note why we ought to paye tribute For seynge that y• hygh powers take so great paynes for to defēde vs & to kepe al that we haue in safegarde agaynst the violence of our enemies, agen to mayntayn vertu & to expulse vice, which thynge can not be brought to passe without prudēt, wyse & learned gouernours, it is expedient that we, whiche receaue these cōmodities of them, do minister agayne vnto thē freely, aboundantly, and liberally, what soeuer they require of vs for y• preseruacion of y• publique weale

and mayntenaunce of theyr dignite. Neyther can we denye thē thys excepte we wyl transgresse Goddes precepte and fall into the daunger of damnacion, and shew that we be moost extreme enemies to oure selues.Math. xvii. Math. xxii. For Christe wyllynge to gyue vs an example of this thyng, payd tribute hym selfe, and commaūded other so to do, sayenge: Paye that whiche is due to Cesar vnto Cesar, vnderstandynge by the name of Cesar euery magistrate and temporal power generally.
                  And that the kynges grace may lawefully withoute onye scruple or grudge of cōscience take such charges of vs as I rehearsed before, and that we oughte not once to mutter agaynst his graces pleasure & wyll ī this behalf, it is manifest by these wordes,i. Reg. viii. which god spake vnto Samuell: This shall be ye lawe or right of y• kyng, sayth he, that shall reigne

ouer you. Your sonnes shall he take for his charettes & for horsemen to ronne before his Charettes, and to be rulers & Captaynes, to be plowe men to tyll his londe, & to be repers in his haruest, & to make hys harnesse, & such thynges as belong to hys Charettes As for your doughters, he shal take them to be Apoticaries Cookes & Bakers. Your best londe & vyneyardes, and oylegardēs shall he take, & gyue vnto his seruaūtes. Of youre seedes also & vineyardes shal he take the tythes, & gyue vnto his Chamberlaynes & seruauntes. And your seruauntes & your maydes & your best yonge men, & youre Asses shall he take, & do his busines wt all. Of your flockes shall he take the tythes, & ye shal be his seruauntes. Are not theise wordes manifest and playne inough to declare what ryght, tytle, & power by the worde of God, our moost excellent Prynce

hath to chalenge and require of vs suche costes & charges, as he sustaynethe for the common weale, & that all that euer we haue, is at his commaundement, & that we oughte by no meanes to resist or say him nay.

Trueth it is, y• we are made free by Christ, but this oure liberte is spirituall and not temporal. By Christ we are delyuered from ye dā

By Christe we are made free from the power of Satā synne, deathe, desperacion and hell, but not from the power of y• ciuile magistrates. By Christ haue we receaued our manumission & fredom
                        •
                      from the condemnacion of all those thinges, īto the which we were cast by the sīne of our fyrste father Adā. So that by Christ we are spiritually made free, if we abyde in his wordes, as we rede ī ye Gospel of Iohn̄ & ī diuers other places of y• holy scripture. But this spiritual liberte maketh vs not free from our obediēce & dutye towarde the temporal power, to whome we owe both oure selues and al that euer we haue, as ye

If the rulare desireth the londes, he hath power to chalenge thē, let him therfore take thē, yf he wyl, I gyue them not to the Emperour but nether do I deny them. Agayn he sayth, it is a great & special document or poynt of teachyng, wherby christen men are taught to be subiecte to the higher powers, bycause

that no man should thyncke that y• constituciō or ordinaūce of an erthly kynge ought to be losoned or broken.Ibidem. Cā magnū. 
                     Math. xvii. For yf the sonne of God payde Tribute, of what greate authorite arte thou, whiche thīkest that thou oughtest not to pay? Theophilacte also sayth,In Lucam. cap. xx. that we corporally obey hym, that hath power on our bodies, whyther he be kyng or Tyraūt, it hyndrethe vs no thynge, that we shoulde spirituallye well please the God of spirites.Math. xxii. For Christ saythe, paye vnto the Emperour, ye whiche is the Emperours, & pay vnto god that, whiche is Gods. Marke that he sayth not, gyue, but paye. It is, saythe he, dette. Paye therfore thy dette. Thy Prynce kepethe the frō thyne enemies, & he causethe that yu lyueste in quiet. Thou therfore for these thinges owest tribute to him.
                  Thus se you proued both by the holy Scripture & the aūcient Doctors,

yt they, which professe Christe,Mark well. are not so made free, but that they are bounde to be subiecte & obediēt to the high powers in al godly and decent matters. Agen, that al thinges ought not to be commō among them, or that they be excepted from such corporall charges, as ye rulers require of thē, but that they ought to paye tribute, custome, taske, subsidye, or ony thynge els, that is required of them by the temporal gouernours, seyng chefely it make

                  S. Iohn in this place forbyddethe no more gentle speache & louynge communicacion,Phil. ii. thā S. Paule in your

other flour dyd forbyd to make prouision for you and yours. But his mynd is this, they which wyl crake & boste by outwarde wordes, yt they loue God & theyr neyghbour, & yet shew it not in workes and truethe, they are lyers, & haue not in thē the christen Charite, which the Scripture cōmendeth so greatly in euery place. Such are lyke thē, of whome S. Paule speaketh on this māner, they saye they knowe God, but wt theyr dedes they denye it playnely,Titus. i. seynge they are obhominable, disobedient and mynded vnto no good workes.i. Ioan. iii. He that hath the substance of the world, sayth S. Iohn, & seeth his brother haue nede, & is moued with no compassion towardes him, howe doth the loue of God abide in hym? As though he should say, albeit a mā craketh neuer so much yt he loueth God,Mark well. yet yf he fulfylleth not that, which God cōmaundeth him, howe

dare suche one boste that he louethe God? A man loueth so muche as he worketh. If he worketh no thynge, nother doth he loue any thing. For as S. Gregory sayth in a certayne homely,Gregorye. the loue of GOD is neuer idle. For he worketh great thinges, yf it be loue, but if it seaseth to worke,i. Cor. xiii. than is it no loue in dede. Loue, sayth S. Paule is pacient & curtious. Loue enuiethe not, loue dothe not frowardely. Loue is not puffed vp, dealeth not dishonestly, seaketh not her owne. Loue is not prouoked to anger, thynketh not euell, reioysethe not of iniquite, but reioyseth in the trueth, suffereth al thinges, beleuethe all thynges, hopethe all thynges, abydethe all thynges. What a poynt is this of loue, to say that I loue God,Note thys well. & yet run a whorehuntynge after straunge Goddes?
                  Agayne what a poynte of loue is this to saye, that I honour ye name

of God, and yet blaspheme it withe mooste shamefull & abhominable othes? What loue is this toward my neyghbour to saye that I loue him and yet wyll do no thynge for hym, whan I se him in necessite? Is this loue? Peryshe moughte suche loue. Agaynste these wicked Hypocrites & open dissemblers dothe S. Iohn in this place thonder,i. Ioan. iii. whā he sayth let vs not loue in worde nor tonge, but in worke & trueth. There were in the tyme of the Apostles manye false Christians, whiche by wordes pretended muche loue both towardes God and theyr neyghbour, and yet dyd they expresse & shew none at all by theyr outward dedes. Such haue we nowe a dayes also among vs, which styffely affyrme that they loue God & his worde, yet do theyr workes proue the contrarye. The scripture reiecteth that loue which is fayned, and is not in spirite and

trueth, that is to say, fyrst engraffed in the harte, & afterwarde declared by manifeste & euident workes, worthy such a loue.

Exhorte hym vnto the true good workes, which god approueth by his worde, & leueth not vnrewarded.Psal. xlix.
