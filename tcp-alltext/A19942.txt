Wherein is proued not onely by aucthoritie of writers, but also by late experience of trauellers and reasons of substantiall probabilitie. that the worlde in all his Zones Clymats and places, is habitable and inhabited, and the Seas likewise vniuersally Nauigable without any naturall anoyance to hinder the same whereby appeares that from England there is a short and speedie passage into the South Seas, to China, Molucca, Phillipina, and India, by Northerly Nauigation, to the renowne honour and benifit of her Maiesties state, and Communalty.

            TO THE RIGHT HOnorable Lordes of her Maiesties most Honorable priuie Consayle.
            
               MY most honorable good Lords for as much as it hath pleased God, not only to bestow vpon your Lordships, the excellent gifts of natures benefite, but hath also beutified the same with such speciall ornamentes of perfection: As that thereby the mindes and attentiue industrie of all, haue no small regard vnto your honorable proceedings. And so much the rather, because to the great content of all her maiesties most louing subiectes, it hath pleased her highnes in her stately regard of gouernment, to make choise of your honours as speciall members in the regall disposition of the mightinesse of her imperiall commaund: Emboldeneth me among the rest to humble my selfe at your honorable feete, in presenting vnto the fauour of your excellent Iudgementes, this short treatise of the worldes Hydrographicall bands. And knowing that not onely your renowned places, but also the singularitie of your education, by the prudent

care of your noble progeniters, hath and still doth ind

               ce and drawe you to fauour and imbrace, Whatsoeuer beareth but a seeming of the Common weales good: Much more then, that which in substantiall truth shalbe most beneficiall to the same. I am therefore the more encouraged not to slacke this my enterprise, because that through your honorable assistance when in the ballance of your wisdomes this discouery shall haue indifferent consideration, I knowe it will be ordered by you to bee a matter of no small moment to the good of our Countrie. For thereby wee shall not onely haue a copious and rich vent for al our naturall and artificiall comodities of England, in short time by safe passage, and without offence of any, but also shall by the first imployment retourne into our Countrey by spedie passage, all Indian commodities in the ripenes of their perfection, whereby her Maiesties Dominions should bee the storehouse of Europe, the nurse of the world, and the glory of nations, in yelding all forrayne naturall benefites, by an easie rate: In communicating vnto all, whatsoeuer God hath vnto any one asigned: And by the increase of all nations, through the mightinesse of trade. Then should the merchant, tradesman, and poore artificer, haue imployment equall to their power and expedition, whereby what notable benefites would growe to her Maiestie, the state, and comunaltie, I refer to your perfect iudgementes. And for that I am desirous to auoyde the contradiction

of vulgar conceipts, I haue thought it my best course, before I make profe of the certaintie of this discouerie, to lay downe whatsoeuer may against the same be obiected, and in the ouerthrowe of those conceipted hinderances the safenes of the passage shall most manifestly appeare, which when your wisdomes shall with your patience peruse, I doe in no sort distruct your fauorable acceptance and honorable asistance of the same. And although for diuers considerations I doe not in this treatis discouer my ful knowledge for the place and altitude of this passage, yet whensoeuer it shall so please your honours to commaund, I will in few wordes make the full certainty thereof knowne vnto your honours being alwaies redie with my person and poore habilitie to prosecute this action as your honours shall direct, beseeching God so to support you with all happines of this life, fauour of her maiestie loue of her highnes subiectes and increase of honour as may be to your best content. I most humbly take my leaue from Sandrudg by Dartmouth this 27. of May 1595.

            The worlds Hydrographicall Obiections against al northerly discoueries.
            
               ALl impedimentes in nature, and circumstances of former practises duly considered. The Noretherly passage to China seme very improbable. For first it is a matter very doubt
               
                  •
               ull whether there bee any such passage or no, sith it hath beene so often attempted and neuer performed, as by historical relation appeareth, whereby wee may fully perswade our selues that America and Asia, or some other contient are so conioyned togeather as that it is impossible for any such passage to be, the certaintie whereof is substantially proued vnto vs by the experience of Sebastian Gabotta an expert Pylot, and a man reported of especiall iudgement, who being that wayes imployed returned without successe. Iasper Corteriallis a man of no meane practise did likewise put the same in execution, with diuers others, all which in the best parte haue concluded ignorance. If not a full consent of no such matter. And therfore sith practise hath reproued the same, there is no reason why men should dote vpon so great an incertayntie, but if a passage may bee prooued and that the contenentes are disioyned whereof there is small hope, yet the impedimentes of the clymate (wherein the same is supposed to lie) are such and so offensiue as that

all hope is thereby likewise vtterly secluded. For within the frozen Zone no reasonable creature will deny but that the extremitie of colde is of such forceable action (being the lest in the fulnes of his owne nature without mitigation) as that it is impossible for any mortall creature to indure the same, by the vertue of whose working power, those Northerly Seas are wholy congealed, making but one mas or contenent of yse, which is the more credible because the ordenary experience of our fishermen geueth vs sufficient notice thereof, by reason of the great quantitie of yse which they find to be brought vpon the cost of newefound land from those Northerne regions. By the aboundance wherof they are so noysomly pestred as that in many weekes they haue not beene able to recouer the 
                  •
               hore, yea and many times recouer it not vntill the season of fishing bee ouer passed. this then beeing so in the Septentrionall latitude of 46.47. and 48. degrees, which by natures benifit are latitudes of better temprature then ours of England, what hope should there remayne for a nauegable passing to be by the norwest, in the altitude of 60.70. or 80. degres, as it may bee more Northerly, when in these temperate partes of the world the shod of that frozen sea breadeth such noysome pester: as the pore fishermē doe continually sustain. And therfore itseemeth to be more then ignorance that men should attempt Nauigation, in desperate

clymates and through seas congeled that neuer dissolue, where the stiffnes of the colde maketh the ayre palpably grosse without certainty that the landes are disioyned.
            All which impediments if they were not, yet in that part of the world, Nauigation cannot be performed as ordenarily it is vsed, for no ordenarie sea chart can describe those regions either in the partes Geographicall or Hydrographicall, where the Meridians doe so spedily gather themselues togeather, the parallells beeing a verye small proportion to a great circle, where quicke and vncertayne variation of the Compasse may greatly hinder or vtterly ouerthrow the attempt. So that for lacke of Curious lyned globes to the right vse of Nauigation, with many other instruments either vnknowne or out of vse, and yet of necessitie for that voyage, it should with great difficultie be attayned. All which the premises considered I refer the conclusion of these obiections, and certainty of this passage to the generall opinion of my louing countrymen, whose dangerous attemptes in those desperate vncertainties I wish to be altred, and better imployed in matters of great probabilitie.
            
               To proue a passage by the Norwest, without any land impedimentes to hinder the same, by aucthoritie of writters, and experience of trauellers, contrary to the former obiections.
               
                  
                  HOmer an Ancient writer affirmeth that the world being deuided into Asia, Africa, and Europa is an Iland, which is likewise so reported by Strabo in his first book of Cosmographie, Pomponius Mela in his third booke Higinius, Solinus with others. Wherby it is manifest that America was then vndiscouered and to them vnknowne, otherwise they would haue made relation of it as of the rest. neither could they in reason haue reported Asia Africa and Europa to bee an Iland vnles they had knowne the same to be conioyned and in all his partes to be inuironed with the seas. And further America being very neere of equall quantitie with all the rest could not be reported as a parte either of Africa Asia or Europa in the ordenarie lymites of discretion. And therefore of necessitie it must be concluded that Asia Africa and Europa the first reueiled world being knowne to bee an Iland, America must likewise be in the same nature because in no parte it conioyneth with the first.
            
            
               By experience of Trauellers to proue this passage.
               ANd that wee neede not to range after forrayne and ancient authorities, whereat curious wittes may take many exceptions, let vs consider the late discoueryes perfourmed, within the space of two ages not yet passed,

whereby it shall so manifestly appeare that Asia Africa and Europa are knit togeather, making one continent, and are wholy inuironed with the seas, as that no reasonnable creature shall haue occasion therof to doubt. And first beginning at the north of Europe, from the north cape in 71. degrees whereby our merchantes passe in their trade to S. Nicholas in Rouscia descending towardes the South, the Nauigation is without impediment to the cape of Bona Esperanca, ordenarilie traded and daily practised. And therefore not to bee gaynesayd: which two capes are distant more then 2000. leagues by the neerest tract, in all which distances America is not founde to bee any thing neere the coastes either of Europe or Afric, for from England the chefest of the partes of Europa to newfoundland being parte of America it is 600. leagues the neerest distance that any part therof beareth vnto Europa. And from cape verde in Gynny being parte of Africa, vnto cape Saint Augustine in brasill beeing parte of America, it wanteth but little of 500. leagues, the neerest distance betweene Africa and America. Likewise from the sayd North cape to Noua zemla by the course of East and West neerest, there is passable sayling, and the North partes of Tartaria are well knowne to be handed with the scithian seas to the promontory Tabin so that truely it is apparant that America is farre remoued and by a great

sea diuided from any parte of Africa or Europa. And for the Southerne partes of the firste reueiled worlde it is most manifest that from the cape of Bona Esperanca towardes the east, the costes of Safalla Mosombi
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     , melinda Arabia and Persia whose gulfes lye open to the mayne occian: And all the coastes of East India to the capes of Callacut and Malacca are banded with a mightie sea vpon the South whose lymattes are yet vndiscouered. And from the Cape of Malacca towardes the North so high as the Ile of Iapan, and from thence the cost of China being part of Asia continueth still North to the promontory Tabin, where the Scithian sea and this Indian sea haue recourse togeather, no part of America being nere the same by many 100 leages to hinder this passage.
               For from the Callafornia being parte of America, to the yles of Phillippina bordering vpon the coastes of China being parte of Asia is 2100. leages and therefore America is farther seperated from Asia, then from any the sea coastes either of Europe or Africa. Wherby it is most manifest that Asia Africa and Europa are conioyned in an Iland. And therefore of necessity followeth that America is cōtained vnder one or many ylāds, for from the septentrionall lat. of 75. deg. vnto the straights of Magilan it is known to be nauigable & hath our west occian to lymet the borders therof, and through the straightes of Magillane no man doubteth

but that there is Nauigable passage, from which straightes vpon all the Westerne borders of America, the costs of Chili, Chuli, Rocha, Baldiuia, Peru to the ystmos of Dariena and so the whole West shores of Noua Hispania are banded out by a long and mightie sea, not hauing any shore neere vnto it by one thousand leagues towardes the West, howe then may it be possible that Asia and America should make one contenent?
            
            
               To proue the premisses by the attemptes of our owne Countrymen, besides others.
               BUt least it should bee obiected that the premises are conceites, the acting aucthors not nominated, I will vse some boldnes to recyte our owne countrymen by whose paynefull trauells these truthes are made manifest vnto vs. Hoping and intreting that it may not bee offensiue though in this sorte I make relation of their actions. And firste to begin with the North partes of Europe, it is not vnknowne to all our countrymen, that from the famous citie of London Syr Huge Willobie knight gaue the first attempt for the North estren discoueries, which were afterward most notably accomplished, by master Borrowes, a Pylot of excellent iudgemente and fortunate in his actions, so farre as Golgoua vayga
                        •
                     s and Noua

Zemla, with trade thereby procured to S. Nicholas in Rouscia. Then succeded master Ginkinson who by his land trauell discouered the Scithian sea to lymit the North coastes of Tartaria, so farre as the riue
                     •
                   
                  ob. S
                     •
                   that by our Countrymen the North partes of Europe are at full made knowne vnto vs: and prooued to ioyne with no other continent to hinder this passage. The common and ordenary trade of the Spanyard and Portingall from Lysborne to the coastes of Guyny, Bynny, Mina, Angola, Manicongo, and the cost of Ethiopia to the cape of Bona Esperanca, and all the cost of Est India and Illes of Molucca, (by which wonderfull and copious trade, they are so mightily inriched, as that now they challeng a monarchy vnto them selues vpon the whole face of the earth) that their trade I say, prooueth that America is farre seperated from any parte of Africa or the South of Asia. And the same Spaniard trading in the Citye of Canton within the kingdome of China, hauing layd his storehouse of aboundance in Manellia a Citye by him erected in Luzon one of the Illes of Phillippa a bordring vpon the cost of China, doth by his common and ordenarie passages to Iapan and other the borders of the coast knowe that the Est continent of Asia lieth due North and South so high as the promontory Tabin wher the Scithian sea and this maine occian of China are vnioyned. But with what care they labour

to conceale that matter of Hydrographie for the better preseruation of their fortunate estate, I refer to the excellent iudgement of states men, that painefully labour in the glorious administartion of a well gouerned Common weale, so that by them Africa and Asia are proued in no parte to ioyne with America thereby to hinder this passage.
            
            
               By late experience to proue that America is an Iland, and may be sayled round about contrary to the former obiection.
               
                  ASia Africa and Europa being prooued to be conioyned and an Iland, it now resteth to bee knowne by what aucthoritie America is proued to be likewise an Iland, so that thereby all land impedimentes are remoued, which might brede the dread or vncertaynty of this passage. The first Englishman that gaue any attempt vpon the coastes of West India being parte of America was Syr Iohn HauKins knight: who there and in that attempt as in many others sithins did and hath prooued himselfe to be a man of excellent capacity, great gouernment, and perfect resolution. For before he attempted the same it was a matter▪ doubtfull and reported the extremest lymit of danger to sayle vpon those coastes. So that it was generally in dread among vs, such is the slow
                     •
                  es of our nation, for the most part of vs rather ioy

at home like Epicures to sit and carpe at other mens hassardes our selues not daring to giue any attempt (I meane such as are at leisure to seeke the good of their Countrie not being any wayes imployed as payne
                     •
                  ull members of a common weale,) then either to further or giue due commendations to the deseruers. howe then may Syr Iohn Haukins bee esteemed who being a man of good account in his Country, of wealth and great imployment, did notwithstanding for the good of his Country, to procure trade, giue that notable and resolute attempt. Whose steps many hundreds following sithins haue made themselues men of good esteeme, and fit for the seruice of her sacrid maiestie.
               And by that his attempt of America (wherof Westindia is a parte) is well prooued to be many hundred leagues distant from any part of Afric or Europe.
               
               Then succeded Syr Francis Drake in his famous and euer renowned voyage about the world, who departing from Plimouth directed his course for the straightes of Magillane, which place was also reported to be most dāgerous by reason of the continuall violent and vnresistable currant that was reported to haue continuall passage into the straightes, so that once entring therein there was no more hope remayning of returne, besides the perill of sheldes, straightnes of 
                     •
                  ee passage, and vncertayne

wyndinges of the same, all which bread dread in the highest degree, the distance and dangers considered. So that before his reuealing of the same the matter was in question, whether there were such a passage or no, or whether Magillane did passe the same, if there was such a man so named, but Syr Frauncis Drake, considering the great benefit that might arise by his voyage through that passage, and the notable discoueries that might be therby perfourmed, regarded not these dastardly affections of the idle multitude, but considering with iudgement that in nature there cold be no such perpetuitie of violence where the occian is in no sorte straighted, proceeded with discreet prouision, and so departing from England ariued vnto the same, and with good successe (through Gods most fauorable mercy passed through) wherein his resolution hath deserued euerlasting commendations. For the place in viewe is dangerous and verye vnpleasing, and in the execution to passe Nothing may seeme more doubtful, for 14. leagues west within the cape of Saint Maria lyeth the first straight, where it floweth and ebbeth with violent swiftnes, the straight not half a mile broad, the first fall into which straight is verye dangerous, and doubtfull. This straight lasteth in his narrownes, 3. leage

But the true straight lyeth from this cape West Nor West, where the land is very high all couered with snowe, and full of dangerous counterwindes, that beate with violence from those huge mountaines, from which cape the straight is neuer broder then 2. leages and in many places not halfe a mile, without hope of ancorage the channell beeing shore deepe more then tow hundreth fadomes▪ and so continueth to the South sea forty leages only to bee releued in little dangerous coues, with many turnings and chang of courses, how perilous then was this passage to Syr Frauncis Drake, to whom at that time no parte therof was knowne. And being without reliefe of ancorage was inforced to follow his course in the hell darke nights, and in all the fury of tempestious

               And after that Syr Frauncis was entred into the South seas he coasted all the Westerne shores of America vntill he came into the Septentrionall latitude of forty eight degrees being on the backe syde of newfound land.

wayes imployed for the discouery of this notable passage, by the honerable care and some charge of Syr Frauncis Walsingham knight principal secretory to her maiestie, with whom diuers noble men and worshipfull merchantes of London ioyned in purse and willingnes for the furtherance of that attempt, but when his honour died the voyage was frindles, and mens mindes alienated from aduenturing therein. In my first voyage not experienced of the nature of those clymattes, and hauing no direction either by Chart Globe or other certayne relation in what altitude that passage was to bee searched. I shaped a Northerly course and so sought the same towards the South, and in that my Northerly course I fell vpon the shore which in ancient time was called Groynland fiue hundred leagues distant from the durseys West Nor West Northerly, the land being very high and full of mightie mountaines all couered with snow no viewe of wood grasse or earth to be seene, and the shore two leages of into the sea so full of yse as that no shipping cold by any meanes come neere the same. The lothsome vewe of the shore, and Irksome noyse of the yse was such as that it bred strange conceipts amōg vs, so that we supposed the place to be wast & voyd of any sencible or vegitable creatures, wherupō I called the same desolation, so coasting this shore towardes the South in the latitude of sixtie degrees, I found it to trend

towardes the west, I still followed the leading thereof in the same height, and after fiftie or sixtie leages, it fayled and lay directly North, which I still followed and in thirtie leages sayling vpon the West side of this coast by me named desolation, we were past all the yse and found many greene and plesant Ills bordering vpon the shore, but the mountains of the maine were still couered with great quantities of snowe, I brought my shippe among those ylls and there mored to refreshe our selues in our wearie trauell, in the latitude of sixtie foure degrees or there about. The people of the Country hauing espyed our shipps came down vnto vs in their Canoes, holding vp their right hand to the Sunne and crying Yliaout, would stricke their brestes, we doing the like the people came aborde our shippes, men of good stature, vnbearded, small eyed and of tractable conditions▪ by whom as signe, would permit, we vnderstoode that towardes the North and West there was a great sea, and vsing the people with kindnesse in geuing them nayles and knifes which of all things they most desired, we departed, and finding the sea free from yse supposing our selues to be past all daunger we shaped our course West Nor West thinking thereby to passe for China, but in the latitude of sixtie sixe degrees, wee fell with an other shore, and there founde an other passage of 20. leages broade directly West into the same▪
                  
which we supposed to bee our hoped strayght, we intered into the same thirty or fortie leages, finding it neither to wyden nor straighten, then considering that the yeere was spent for this was in the fyue of August, and not knowing the length of this straight and dangers thereof, we tooke it our best course to retourne with notice of our good successe for this small time of search. And so retourning in a sharpe fret of Westerly windes the 29. of September we ariued at Dartmouth. And acquainting master Secretory with the rest of the honorable and worshipfull aduenturers of all our procedinges. I was appointed againe the seconde yeere to search the bottome of this straight, because by all likelihood it was the place and passage by vs laboured for. In this second attempt the merchants of Exeter, and other places of the West became aduenturers in the action, so that being sufficiently furnished for sixe monthes, and hauing direction to search this straightes, vntill we found the same to fall into an other sea vpon the West side of this part of America, we should agayne retourne for then it was not to be doubted, but shiping with trade might safely bee conueied to China and the parts of Asia. We departed from Dartmouth, & ariuing vnto the south part of ye cost of desolatiō costed y• same vpon his west shore to the lat. of 66. degres, and there ancored among the ylls bordering vpon the same, where wee refreshed

But by such thinges as there we found wee knewe that they were not Xpians of Europe that vsed that trade, in fine by seaching with our boate, wee founde small

at large the relation of this seconde attempt, I receiued fauorable countenance from his honour, aduising mee to prosecute the action, of which his Lordship conceiued a very good opinion. The next yeere although diuers of the aduenturers fel from the action, as al the western merchantes and most of those in London yet some of the aduenturers both honorable and worshipfull continued their willing fauour and charge, so that by this meanes the next yeere 2. shippes were appointed for the fishing and one pynace for the discouery.
               Departing from Dartmouth through gods merciful fauour I ariued to the place of fishing and there according to my directiō I left the 2. shipps to follow that busines, taking their faithful promise not to depart vntill my returne vnto them, which shoulde bee in the fine of August, and so in the barke I proceeded for the discouery but after my departure in sixteene dayes the shippes had finished their voyage, and so presently departed for England, without regard of their promise, my selfe not distrusting any such hard measure proceeded in the discouerie and followed my course in the free and open sea betweene North and Nor west to the latitude of sixtie seuen degrees and there I might see America, West from me, and Desolation East, then when I saw the land of both sides, I began to distrust that it would prooue but a gulfe, notwithstanding desirous to knowe the

full certaintye I proceeded, and in sixtie eight degrees the passage enlarged so that I could not see the westerne shore, thus I continued to the latitude of seuentie fiue degrees, in a great sea, free from yse coasting the westerne shore of Desolation, the people came continually rowing out vnto me in their Cauoas twenty, forty, and one hundred at a time, and would giue me fishe dried, Samon, Samon peale, cod, Caplin, Lumpe, stone base, and such like, besides diuers kindes of birdes, as Partrig, Fesant, Gulls, sea birdes, and other kindes of fleshe, I still laboured by signes to knowe from them what they knew of any sea towards the North▪ they still made signes of a great sea as we vnderstood them, then I departed from that coast thinking to discouer the North parts of America, and after I had sayled towardes the west neere fortie leages I fell vpon a great bancke of yse, the wind being North and blewe much, I was constrained to coast the same towardes the South, not seeing any shore West from me, neither was there any yse towards the North, but a great sea, free, large, very salt and blue and of an vnsearcheable depth. So coasting towardes the South I came to the place wher I left the shippes to fishe, but found, them not. Then being forsaken and left in this distresse referring my selfe to the mercifull prouidence of God, shaped my course for England and vnhoped for of any God alone releuing me I ariued

at Dartmouth, by this last discouerie it seemed most manifest that the passage was free and without impediment towards the North, but by reason of the spanish fleete and vnfortunate time of master Secretoryes death the voyage was omitted and neuer sithens attempted. The cause why I vse this particular relation of all my procedinges for this discouery, is to stay this obiection, why hath not Dauis discouered this passage being thrise that wayes imploied? how far I proceeded and in what fourme this discouery lyeth, doth appeare vpon the Globe which master Sanderson to his verye great charge hath published whose labouring indeuour for the good of his countrie, deserueth great fauour and commendations. Made by master Emery Mullineux a man wel qualited of a good iudgement and verye expert in many excellent practises, in my selfe being the onely meane with master Sanderson to imploy master Mulineux therein, whereby he is nowe▪ growne to a most exquisite perfection.
               
                  Anthony de Mendoza viceroy of Mexico, sent certayne of his captaynes by land, and also a nauy of shipps by sea to search out the Norwest passage, who affirmed by his letters dated from Mexico in Anno 1541. vnto the Emperour beeing then in Flaunders that towardes the Norwest hee had founde the kingdome of Cette, Citta, Alls, Ceuera, seuen cities, and howe beyond the sayd kingdome farther

                     o Vasques of Coronado hauing passed great desarts came to the sea side, where he found certayne shippes which sayled by that sea with merchandize, and had in their banners vpon the prows of their shippes, certayne fowles made of golde and siluer, named Alcatrazzi, and that the mariners signified vnto him by signes, that they were thirtie dayes comming to that hauen, whereby he vnderstoode that those could be of no other country but of Asia, the next knowne continent towardes the West. And farther the sayd Anthony affirmed that by men wel practised hee vnderstoode that 950. leages of that country was discouered vpon the same Sea, now if the cost in that distance of leages should lye to the West, it would then adioyne with the North partes of Asia, and then it would be a far shorter voyage then thirtie dayes sayling, but that it is nothing neere Asia by former authoritie is sufficiently expressed, then if it should lie towardes the North it would extend it selfe almost vnto the pole, a voiage ouer tedious to be perfourmed by land trauell. Therefore of necessity this distance of 950. leages must lie betweene the North and East, which by Anthony de Especio in his late trauells vpon the North of America is sufficiently discouered, then this beeing so the distance is very small betweene the East parte of this discouered Sea and the passage wherein I haue so painefully

laboured, what doth then hinder vs of England vnto whom of all nations this discouery would be most beneficiall to be incredulus

                  low of vnderstanding, and necligent in the highest degree, for the search of this passage which is most apparantly prooued and of wonderfull benefit to the vniuersall state of our countrey. Why should we be thus blinded seeing our enemies to posses the fruites of our blessednes, and yet will not perceiue the same. But I hope the eternall maiestie of God the sole disposer of all thinges will also make this to appeare in his good time.
               
                  Cornelius Nepos recyteth, that when Quintus Metellus Caesar was proconsull for the Romanes in Fraunce, the king of Sweuia gaue him certayne Indians, which sayling out of India for merchandize were by tempest driuen vpon the coastes of Germany, a matter very strange that Indians in the fury of stormes should ariue vpon that coast, it resteth nowe carefully to consider by what winde they were so driuen, if they had beene of any parte of Africa how could they escape the ylls of cape Verd, or the ylles of Canaria the coastes of Spayne Fraunce Ireland or England to ariue as they did, but it was neuer knowne that any the natyues of Afric or Ethiopia haue vsed shippings. Therefore they could not bee of that parte of the worlde, for in that distance sayling they would haue beene starued if no other shore had giuen them relefe.
               
                  And that they were not of America is verye manifest, for vpon all the Est parte of that continent, beeing now thereby discouered, it hath not at any time beene perceiued that those people were euer accustomed to any order of shiping, which appeareth by the ariuall of Colon vpon those coastes, for they had his shipping in such wonderfull admiration that they supposed him and his companie, to haue descended from heauen, so rare & strang a thing was shiping in their eyes. Therefore those Indians could not bee of America safely to bee driuen vpon the chastes of Germany, the distance and impedimentes well considered.
               Then comming neither from Afric nor America, they must of necessitie come from Asia by the Noreast, or Norwest, passages. But it should seme that they came not by the Noreast to double the promontory Tabin, to bee forced through the scithiā sea, and to haue good passage through the narrow straight of Noua Zemla & neuer to recouer any shore is a matter of great imposibilitie. Therefore it must needes be concluded that they came, by the North partes of America through that discouered sea of 950. leages, and that they were of those people which Francisco Vasques of Coronado discouered, all which premises considered there remaineth no more doubting but that the landes are disioyned and that there is a Nauigable passage by the Norwest, of God for vs alone

ordained, to our infinite happines, and for the euer being glory of her maiestie, for then her stately seate of London, should be the storehouse of Europe: the nurse of the world: and the renowne of nations, in yelding all forraine naturall benefits, by an easie rate, in short time returned vnto vs, and in ye fulnes of their natural perfection: by natural participatiō through the world of all naturall and artificiall benefites, for want whereof at this present the most part liue distressed: and by the excellent comoditie of her seate, the mightines of her trade, with force of shipping thereby arising, and most aboundant accesse and intercourse from all the kingdomes of the worlde, then should the ydle hand bee scorned, and plenty by industry in all this land should be proclamed.
               And therefore the passage procued, and the benefites to all most apparant, let vs no longer neglect our hapines, but like christians with willing and voluntary spirits labour without fainting for this so excellent a benefit.

as touching the frost and fresing of the seas, it is supposed that the frozen Zone is not habitable and seas innauigable by reason of the vehemencie of cold, by the diuine creator allotted to ye part of the world, & we are drawn into ye absurdity of this opiniō by a coniectural reason of the sunnes far distance and long absence vnder the Horyzon of the greatest parte of that Zone, whereby the working power of colde perfourmeth the fulnesse of his nature, not hauing any contrary disposition to hinder the same, and when the Sunne by his presence should comfort that parte of the world, his beames are so far remoued from perpendicularitie by reason of his continuall ueerenes to the Horizon, 
                     〈◊〉
                   that the effectes thereof answere not the violence of the winters cold. And therefore those seas remayne for euer vndissolued. Which if it be so, that the nature of cold can congeale the seas, it is very likely that his first working power, beginneth vpon the vpper face of the waters, and so descending worketh his effect, which if it were, howe then commeth it to passe that shippes sayle by the North cape, to Saint Nicholas fiue degrees or more within the frozen Zone, and finde the seas free from pester of yse, the farther from the shore the clearer from yse.

The other kind is called flake yse, blue, very heard and thinne not aboue three fadomes thick at the farthest, and this kinde of yse bordreth close vpon the shore. And as the nature of heate with apt vessels deuideth the pure spirit from his grosse partes by the coning practise of distillation: so doth the colde in these regions deuide and congeale the fresh water from the salt, nere such shores where by the aboundance of freshe riuers, the saltnes of the sea is mittigated, and not else where, for all yse in generall being dissolued is very fresh water, so that by the experience of all that haue euer trauelled towardes the North it is well knowne, that the sea neuer fryseth, but wee know that the sea dissolueth this yse with great speede, for in twentie foure houres I haue seene an ylande of yse turne vp and downe, as the common phrase is, because it hath melted so fast vnder water that the heauior parte hath beene vpwarde, which hath beene the cause of his so turning, for the heuiest part of all things swiming is by nature downwards, and therfore sith the sea is by his heate of power to dissolue

yse, it is greatly against reason that the same should be frozen, so that the congealation of the seas can bée no hinderance to the execution of this passage, contrary to the former obiection, by late experience reprooued, yet if experience wanted, in ordenary reason men should not suppose nature to bee monstrous, for if all such yse and snowe as congealeth and descendeth in the winter, did not by natures benefit dissolue in the sommer, but that the cold were more actual thē the heate, that difference of inequallitie bee it neuer so little would by time bread natures ouerthrowe, for if the one thousand parte of the yse which in winter is congealed, did the next Sommer remayne vndissolued, that continual diffrence sithins the worldes creation would not onely haue conuerted all those North seas into yse, but would also by continuall accesse of snow haue extended himselfe aboue all the ayers regions, by which reason all such exalations as should be drawn from the earth and seas within the temperate zones and by windes driuen into these sti

                  fe regions, that moysture was no more to bee hoped for that by dissolution it should haue any returne, so that by time the world should be left waterlesse. And therefore how ridiculus this imagination of the seas frysing is. I refer to the worlds generall opinion.

                  ANd now for a full answere of all obiections, if the ayre bee prooued tollerable then this most excellent and commodious passage, is without al contradiction to be perfourmed. And that the ayre is tollerable as well in the winter as in the Sommer is thus prooued. The inhabitantes of Moscouia, Lapland Swethland, Norway, and Tartaria, omit not to trauel for their commodity: in the deepest of winter, passing by sleades ouer the yse and congealed snowe being made very slipperie and compact like yse by reason of much wearing and trading▪ hauing the vse of a kind of stag by them called Reen to drawe those their sleades.

In which place their continuall day from the Sunne rising to the sunne setting is equall with twenty sixe wekes and fiue dayes, after our rate: and their night is equall with twenty fiue weekes and three dayes such as we haue, so that our whole yeere is withthem but one night and one day, a wonderfull difference from al the rest of the world, and therefore no doubt but those people haue a wonderfull excellencie, and an exceeding prorogatiue aboue all nations of the earth, and this which is more to be noted. In al other places of the world the absence and presence of the Sun is in equall proportion of time, hauing as much night as day, but vnder the Pole their artificiall day (that is the continuall presence of the Sunne before he sett) is nine of our naturall dayes or two hundreth 16. houres longer then is their night, whereby it appeareth that they haue, the life, light, and comfort of nature in a higher measure then all the nations of the earth.

                   by this passage being discouered.
               THe benifits which may grow by this discouery, are copious and of two sorts, a benifit spirituall, and a benifit corporall. Both which sith by the lawes of God and nature, we are bound to regard, yet principally we are admonished first to seeke the kingdome of God and the righteousnes thereof, and all thinges shall be giuen vnto vs. And therfore in seeking the kingdome of God we are not onely tied to the depe search of Gods sacrid word, and to liue within the perfect lymits of christianity, but also by al meanes we are bound to multiply and increase the flocke of the faithfull. Which by this discouery wilbe most aboundantly perfourmed, to the preseruation of many thousands, which now most miserably are couered vnder the lothsome vayle of ignorance, neither can we in any sort doubt of their recouery by this passage discouered, Gods prouidence therin being considered, who most mercifully sayth by the mouth of his prophet Esaias, 66. I will come to gather all people and tongues, then shall they come and see my glory, of them that shall be saued I will send some to the gētils in the sea▪ & theyls far of that haue not heard speak of me and haue not sene my glory

shall preach my peace among the Gentiles.
               
               
                  And in his 65. Chapter he farther sayth. They seeke me that hitherto haue not asked for me, they find me that hitherto haue not sought me.
               
               
                  And againe chapter 49. I wil make waies vpon all my mountains, and my footpathes shall be exalted, and behold these shall come from farre, some from the North and West, some from the land of Symis which is in the South. Then sith it is so appointed that there shalbe one shepheard and one flocke, what hindreth vs of England (being by Gods mercy for the same purpose at this present most apely prepared) not to attempt that which God himselfe hath appointed to be performed, ther is no doubt but that wee of England are this saued people by the eternal & infallible presence of ye lord predestinated to be sent vnto these Gentiles in the sea, to those ylls and famous kingdoms ther to preach the peace of the Lorde; for are not we onely set vpon mount Sion to giue light to all the rest of the world, haue not we the true handmayd of the Lord to rule vs, vnto whom the eternall maiestie of God hath reueled his truth and supreme power of excellencye, by whom then shall the truth be preached, but by them vnto whom the truth is reueled, it is onely we therefore that must be these shining messengers of the Lord and none but we, for as the prophet sayth. O how beutifull are the feet of

the messenger that bringeth the message from the mountayne, that proclameth peace, that bringeth the good tidings and preacheth health and sayth to Sion thy God is king, so that hereby the spirituall benefit arising by this discouery is most apparant, for which if there were no other cause wee are all bound to labour with purse and minde for the discouery of this notable passage.
               And nowe as touching the corporall and worldly benifits which will thereby arise our owne late experience leadeth vs to the full knowledge thereof. For as by the communitie of trade groweth the mightines of riches, so by the kinde and guide of such tradinges may growe the multiplication of such benefits with assurance how the same may in the best sort be continued▪ In the consideratiō wherof it is first to bee regarded with what commodities our owne country aboundeth either naturall or artificiall, what quantity may be spared, and wher the same may with greatest aduantage be vented. And in the sale or forrayne passage therof▪ wee must respect what commodities either naturall or artificiall our country is depriued of, and where the same may with the easiest rate be gained, and how in his best nature vnto vs returned, all which by this passage shall be vnto vs most plentifully effected, and not onely that, but this also which is most to

And the Lords and and subiectes temporal for the renowne of their prince, and glory of their nation should be thervnto most vehemently affected.
