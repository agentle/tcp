                  TO THE RIGHT VVORſhipfull, Sir Thomas Smith of Hough, in the Countie of Cheſter, Knight; Francis Pilkington Batchelor of Muſicke, and Luteniſt, wiſheth all happines in this life, and eternall felicity in the life to come.
                  
                     RIght Worſhipfull, there is held an infallible opinion, that the ſacred Art of Muſicke (being chiefly illuſtrated by Voyces) notwithſtanding all Artiſts, in reſpect of the compaſſe and quality of voyces and inſtruments, doe limit it within ſcales and other certaine dimenſions, is in it owne nature INFINITE; reaching from the baſe Earth (being as it were the GAM-VT or ground) to the higheſt E. LA. of the incomprehenſible heauens: For demonſtration whereof, GOD to his great Glory, doth diuerſly and wonderfully enable his creatures thereunto, teaching man vpon earth, not onely in mellifluous Notes to chant; but alſo vpon variety of Inſtruments ſweetly to expreſſe the hidden ſecrets of that ſacred Science, & not leauing the vaſt Ayre empty of his glory; he inſtructeth the early Larke to warble forth his prayſe; who, (as ſome hould) learneth his layes from the muſicall motions of the heauenly Spheares, and from thence to tranſcend vp to the ſeate of the moſt higheſt, the elected Saints and Angels doe in heauenly Himmes, ſing perpetually Te deum to the holy Trinitie, ſitting on the Throne of moſt Maieſticke glorie.
                  In which quality of Muſicke (Right worſhipfull) hauing ſpent a great part of my time, I haue now (after ſome others) of late produced this ſmall peece of worke; which albeit for the inſufficiency thereof, I doe hold to be too vnworthie to be preſented to your Worſhip, yet in regarde of the many and manifold fauors, which I haue receiued at your hands, and your exquiſit skill, both in the Theorique and Practique of that excellent Art; I doe preſume to tender it to your Patronage and protection, chuſing rather to be cenſured for ouer-boldneſſe, then to be taxed with ingratitude or forgetfulneſſe. And ſo humbly deſiring your Worſhip to accept of this, and to ſhield it from all pragmaticall and ſtigmaticall detractors; vntill my beſt skill and endeauour, ſhall incite my weake Muſe to performe ſome worke of better worth, I craue pardon for my bouldneſſe, and commit your Worſhip and the good Lady your wife, to the bleſſed tuition of the GOD of Iſraell.

                     RIght Worſhipfull, there is held an infallible opinion, that the ſacred Art of Muſicke (being chiefly illuſtrated by Voyces) notwithſtanding all Artiſts, in reſpect of the compaſſe and quality of voyces and inſtruments, doe limit it within ſcales and other certaine dimenſions, is in it owne nature INFINITE; reaching from the baſe Earth (being as it were the GAM-VT or ground) to the higheſt E. LA. of the incomprehenſible heauens: For demonſtration whereof, GOD to his great Glory, doth diuerſly and wonderfully enable his creatures thereunto, teaching man vpon earth, not onely in mellifluous Notes to chant; but alſo vpon variety of Inſtruments ſweetly to expreſſe the hidden ſecrets of that ſacred Science, & not leauing the vaſt Ayre empty of his glory; he inſtructeth the early Larke to warble forth his prayſe; who, (as ſomehould) learneth his layes from the muſicall motions of the heauenly Spheares, and from thence to tranſcend vp to the ſeate of the moſt higheſt, the elected Saints and Angels doe in heauenly Himmes, ſing perpetually Te deum to the holy Trinitie, ſitting on the Throne of moſt Maieſticke glorie.
                  In which quality of Muſicke (Right worſhipfull) hauing ſpent a great part of my time, I haue now (after ſome others) of late produced this ſmall peece of worke; which albeit for the inſufficiency thereof, I doe hold to be too vnworthie to be preſented to your Worſhip, yet in regarde of the many and manifold fauors, which I haue receiued at your hands, and your exquiſit skill, both in the Theorique and Practique of that excellent Art; I doe preſume to tender it to your Patronage and protection, chuſing rather to be cenſured for ouer-boldneſſe, then to be taxed with ingratitude or forgetfulneſſe. And ſo humbly deſiring your Worſhip to accept of this, and to ſhield it from all pragmaticall and ſtigmaticall detractors; vntill my beſt skill and endeauour, ſhall incite my weake Muſe to performe ſome worke of better worth, I craue pardon for my bouldneſſe, and commit your Worſhip and the good Lady your wife, to the bleſſed tuition of the GOD of Iſraell.

                     RIght Worſhipfull, there is held an infallible opinion, that the ſacred Art of Muſicke (being chiefly illuſtrated by Voyces) notwithſtanding all Artiſts, in reſpect of the compaſſe and quality of voyces and inſtruments, doe limit it within ſcales and other certaine dimenſions, is in it owne nature INFINITE; reaching from the baſe Earth (being as it were the GAM-VT or ground) to the higheſt E. LA. of the incomprehenſible heauens: For demonſtration whereof, GOD to his great Glory, doth diuerſly and wonderfully enable his creatures thereunto, teaching man vpon earth, not onely in mellifluous Notes to chant; but alſo vpon variety of Inſtruments ſweetly to expreſſe the hidden ſecrets of that ſacred Science, & not leauing the vaſt Ayre empty of his glory; he inſtructeth the early Larke to warble forth his prayſe; who, (as ſome hould) learneth his layes from the muſicall motions of the heauenly Spheares, and from thence to tranſcend vp to the ſeate of the moſt higheſt, the elected Saints and Angels doe in heauenly Himmes, ſing perpetually Te deum to the holy Trinitie, ſitting on the Throne of moſt Maieſticke glorie.
                  In which quality of Muſicke (Right worſhipfull) hauing ſpent a great part of my time, I haue now (after ſome others) of late produced this ſmall peece of worke; which albeit for the inſufficiency thereof, I doe hold to be too vnworthie to be preſented to your Worſhip, yet in regarde of the many and manifold fauors, which I haue receiued at your hands, and your exquiſit skill, both in the Theorique and Practique of that excellent Art; I doe preſume to tender it to your Patronage and protection, chuſing rather to be cenſured for ouer-boldneſſe, then to be taxed with ingratitude or forgetfulneſſe. And ſo humbly deſiring your Worſhip to accept of this, and to ſhield it from all pragmaticall and ſtigmaticall detractors; vntill my beſt skill and endeauour, ſhall incite my weake Muſe to performe ſome worke of better worth, I craue pardon for my bouldneſſe, and commit your Worſhip and the good Lady your wife, to the bleſſed tuition of the GOD of Iſraell.

                     RIght Worſhipfull, there is held an infallible opinion, that the ſacred Art of Muſicke (being chiefly illuſtrated by Voyces) notwithſtanding all Artiſts, in reſpect of the compaſſe and quality of voyces and inſtruments, doe limit it within ſcales and other certaine dimenſions, is in it owne nature INFINITE; reaching from the baſe Earth (being as it were the GAM-VT or ground) to the higheſt E. LA. of the incomprehenſible heauens: For demonſtration whereof, GOD to his great Glory, doth diuerſly and wonderfully enable his creatures thereunto, teaching man vpon earth, not onely in mellifluous Notes to chant; but alſo vpon variety of Inſtruments ſweetly to expreſſe the hidden ſecrets of that ſacred Science, & not leauing the vaſt Ayre empty of his glory; he inſtructeth the early Larke to warble forth his prayſe; who, (as ſome hould) learneth his layes from the muſicall motions of the heauenly Spheares, and from thence to tranſcend vp to the ſeate of the moſt higheſt, the elected Saints and Angels doe in heauenly Himmes, ſing perpetually Te deum to the holy Trinitie, ſitting on the Throne of moſt Maieſticke glorie.
                  In which quality of Muſicke (Right worſhipfull) hauing ſpent a great part of my time, I haue now (after ſome others) of late produced this ſmall peece of worke; which albeit for the inſufficiency thereof, I doe hold to be too vnworthie to be preſented to your Worſhip, yet in regarde of the many and manifold fauors, which I haue receiued at your hands, and your exquiſit skill, both in the Theorique and Practique of that excellent Art; I doe preſume to tender it to your Patronage and protection, chuſing rather to be cenſured for ouer-boldneſſe, then to be taxed with ingratitude or forgetfulneſſe. And ſo humbly deſiring your Worſhip to accept of this, and to ſhield it from all pragmaticall and ſtigmaticall detractors; vntill my beſt skill and endeauour, ſhall incite my weake Muſe to performe ſome worke of better worth I craue pardon for my bouldneſſe, and commit your Worſhip and the good Lady your wife, to the bleſſed tuition of the GOD of Iſraell.
