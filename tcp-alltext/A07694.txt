                        THere is a nother question, whyther the chyrche maye erre. Whyche yf ye vnderstande of the pope and hys generacyon / is verely as harde a questyon as to aske  whyther he that hath bothe hys eyes out be blynde or no, or whyther it be possible for hym that hath one legge shorter then a nother, to halte.

                     WHo wolde not nowe wene that thys man had a playne clere open cause and easy to defende / when that euyn in y• begynnyng in so few wordes, he concludeth all the mater at onys / and that wyth ensamples so playne and euydent, that euery man muste nedys agree them to be trew
                        •
                      But when ye shall agayne se, that hys ensamples are no more  lyghtsome, then v

                     lyke the mater that he resembleth them vnto / and that he eyther of wylynesse wyll not, or for lacke of wytte can not perceyue and se the poynt that he shulde towche: then shall euery wyse man well perceyue and se, that hys solempne shewe of suche confydence in hys euyll cause, is nothynge but a playne proclamacyon made by hys owne mouth, of hys owne rebuke and shame.
                  For here wolde I wytte what thynge Tyndale meaneth, by the pope and popys generacyon. If he meane hys carnall kynredde, or the pope and his cardynallys eyther: he then wynketh of wylynesse, and wyll not se the marke. For he knoweth very well y• neyther of these is the thyng

that we call the chyrche, when we speke of the catholyke  chyrche of Cryste that can not erre.
                  If he meane by the pope and hys generacyon, all the crystens nacyons not beynge cut of nor caste out for theyr obstynate malyce, nor of wylfulnesse departyng out by sedycyouse scysmes: then seeth he y• marke at the leste wyse. But then whyle he sayth that all these nacyons maye and hath all thys .viii. hundred yere, so entyerly fallen in to heresyes and dampnable errours, that by all thys .viii. hundred yeres laste passed vnto Luthers dayes, nor yet vnto thys daye neyther, there hath ben no one knowen congregacyon any where, wherin y• professynge of the very ryght catholyke fayth of Cryst hath bene so surely kepte, that yt myghte there be surely lerned and knowen: then I saye Tyndale ys as blynde as he that lacketh bothe hys eyes /  in that he seeth not that by thys waye he maketh our sauyoure Cryste that is very trewth to saye very false, where he sayth I am wyth you to the ende of the worlde / & wolde make hym farre ouerseen,

                  Moreouer, yf Tyndale saye that all thys knowen corps of crystendome, haue all these .viii. hundred yere ben in a wronge bylyefe / where hath ben all thys whyle the ryght congregacyon of Tyndals chyrche, that hath h
                        ••
                      the trewe bylyefe? And lette hym tell vs then, whyche congregacyon  it was, or where any suche is yet, of whom we maye surely lerne the trewe fayth and trewe vertues.
                  If he saye that it hath ben amonge these, and was in thys chyrche but not of thys chyrch / but they haue lurked there a few faythfull folke, amonge the greate many multytude of the faythlesse, and haue euer bene to the worlde and outwarde syghte of man vnknowen / not so mych knowen as one of them to another, but yet very well knowen to god: to thys, besydes that yf they haue lyen all thys whyle lurkynge therin, they haue be then idolatres by theyr owne iudgemente, in image seruyce and prayeng to

                      sayntes (yf Tyndals doctryne be the trewe faythe) and starke ypocrytes in beynge of one bylyefe in theyr hartes, and pretendyng another, both in theyr wordes and dedes / and besyde dyuerse other inuyncyble reasons, wyth which I haue all redy reproued that fonde opynyō in the seconde boke of my dyaloge, where vnto Tyndale hath made so bare answere that it hadde ben more wysedome for hym to haue lette it all alone and medle nothynge therwyth, as euery chylde almoste maye well perceyue that lyste to loke on them bothe, and aduysedly compare them togyder, as I shall my selfe set it forth vnto them when god shall after other thynges done gyue me tyme to come therto / and besyde dyuers other argumentes euydent and playne, whyche I partely haue, partely shall alledge and brynge forth  in thys present work: this one can he neuer auoyde whyle he lyueth, that god had then lefte euery man perplexed in dowte and out of certaynte, what waye he myghte surely take and cleue vnto, eyther in the doctryne of fayth or knowlege of vertuose lyuynge.
                  For yf he saye that we nede no knowen company, but euery man maye rede the scrypture hym selfe: euery man he woteth well can not rede, nor euery man vnderstand it though he haue it in hys owne tonge / but by the redynge wythout a reder, maye soone fall into the dampnable errour of Arrius, Heluidius, and many a nother heretyke mo / whyche of the scrypture thorow theyr owne pryde toke occasyon of theyr heresyes.
                  If he then saye that of that vnknowen congregacyon,  we maye haue a trew reder: where shall I seke hym, and wherby shall I knowe hym / yf I happen on hym, howe shall I be sure? For in thys great knowen congregacyon, we be saufe agaynste all suche parell. For we be all agreed vppon the necessarye artycles of the fayth. And yf any wolde preche and teche the contrary / as he that wold percase teche that confessyon is not necessarye, and that penaunce nedeth not, and that of the .vii. sacramentes .v. serue of nought, and the syxte of almost as lytell / and that of the seuenth all crysten nacyons be, and all thys .xv. hundred yere haue ben in a very damnable erroure: he that thus wolde preache and teche suche habomynable heresyes

as nowe Tyndale doth, he maye be soone controlled, accused and corrected / excepte he ronne awaye as Tyndale doeth.
                  And wherby can we be sure that hys techynge whyche ys accusyd, ys false and theyrs trewe that correcte hym / but by that we be sure that the comen fayth of the catholyke chyrch is trewe / and that the catholyke knowen chyrche can not erre in that fayth, whych from hande to hande hath ben taken & kepte from Crystes dayes and hys apostles hytherto. whyche fayth muste nedes be trewe by Crystes promyse made vnto hys apostles, as teachers of hys chyrche, and not for them selfe but for hys chyrche / that is to wytte,
                        Matth. 16.
                      the fayth that saynte Peter professed shulde not fayle, and that god wolde be wyth them all dayes vnto the ende of the worlde.
                        Matth. 28.
                      And that the fayth of the knowen  catholyke chyrche, that corre

                     teth the false fayth of the false precheours and heretykes, is the same fayth whyche the holy doctours of Crystes chyrche in euery age haue beleued and taught: saynte Ierome, saynte Austeyne, saynt Ambrose, saynte Chrysosteme, 
                        •
                     aynte Gregory, and saynte Cypryane do well and clerely testyfye by theyr bokes. For whyche holy doctours our lorde hath shewyd many a wonderfull myracle.
                  These thynges and many other maketh vs sure, that the prechour whyche prechyth agaynste the fayth of thys congregacyon is a false prechour, and a false wryther and wrester of holy scrypture / howe solempnely so euer he paynte yt.
                  And yf we were not sure by these meanes, that the fayth  of thys knowen catholyke congregacyon is trewe / how shulde I be sure of the prechour of that vnknowen congregacyon, whyche Tyndale calleth the chyrche. How shuld I know I saye whyther ye prechour say trew or not. For he hath no knowen congregacyon to reproue hym or allow hym the suerty wherof myght make me sure that he sayth trewe or false.
                  But then muste I sayth Tyndale, trye hym by ye trewth of scrypture. what yf I be vnlerned? what yf I can rede & haue it in my langage, and yet vnderstand it but slēderly? what yf I be well lerned, and the false prechour as well lerned

                      as I though he were no better: yet he shall haue texte agaynste texte, and glose agaynste glose / and when shall we then agree? Or yf I gyue place to hym or he to me / how shall yet the nomber of vnlerned herers be satysfyed wyth our dowtefull dysputacyons, yf they were not sure by the comon fayth of the knowen catholyke chyrch, whyche of vs lyed ere euer we came to gyther. By whyche they that neuer redde any scrypture / be now by the holy goost that hath planted the trewe fayth in his catholyke chyrche (y• holy doctours wherof haue in euery age ben approued by myracles) so inwardly sure of the trewth, that a poore symple woman yf Tyndale and I broughte the trouth in debate and questyon, and that I were waxen so madde to graunte hym that hys false heresyes were trewe / she wold  not lette to byleue and saye so to, that we were two madde folys and false heretykes bothe.

                      and also the nette wyth fysshes good and badde / and the scrypture sheweth by the arch of Noe with bestes clene and vnclene / and Cryste wyth hys aforesayde wordes to his apostles:
                        Iohā. 6.
                      Haue I not chosen you twelue and one of you ys a deuyll.
                  Now as for y• electe chyrch of predestynates yf he speke therof, as it may be verifyed in euery tyme syth it begā as he must yf he speke to the purpose / then are there therin accoūted not onely repētyng synners, but synners also, some yt yet repente them not, & some also yt neuer dyd the thyng wherof they shuld repente / as was our blessed lady whyle she lyued here, and our sauyour hym selfe also for any syn  of hym self. For he was neuer penytent synner / but beyng synlesse hym selfe, paynfully payed for ours. So is not y• electe chyrch all repentyng synners onely, except y• eyther Cryste were no man or wer

                      also a synner, or els his manhed not parte of thys chyrche, but the chyrche of predestynates hedlesse. And in this I speke of that electe chyrch of predestynates, concernyng onely the cōgregacyon of such as shalbe saued in the kynde of man. For as for to cōsyder angels therin, is very farre fro thys mater.
                  yet are there also in thys chyrche of electes many that neuer came to the fayth, but are yet enmyes there vnto / as Iewes, Saracenes, or Turkes, not yet conuerted vnto y• fayth. And therfore thys electe chyrche wyll in no wyse agre wyth the dyffynycyon or descrypcyon of Tyndale. I  wolde that he therfore to gyue his mater more lyght, had shewed vs as I say, which kynde of eleccyon he meaneth.
                  How be yt we shall gesse at hys mynde as nere as we can and make the best of hys mater / and then se whyther the beste be able to stande

                        •
                      a parte of the electe chyrche of the seconde maner / that is to wyt as many therof as be repentaunt synners wyth those other condicyons that are expressed in hys des

                     rypcyon. For other then thys I can not deuyne what he shold meane. But then as those repentaunt synners be a parte of the chyrche predestynate / so be they a parte of thys catholyke chyrche here mylytaūt after the fy
                        •
                     st kynde of eleccyon, in whych are bothe good and bad / of whych hole nomber the good are y• tone parte.
                  
                     yet leueth he vs after thys waye in a nother dowt / whyther  the repentynge synners may afterwarde fall to synne agayne, and from repentaunce and so to repentaunce agayne, and yet agayne therfro. He leueth vs also in dowt whyther thys electe chyrche of hys descrypcyon maye be deceyued & erre or not. For in these two poyntes he wrappeth vs vp wyth rydles, that he gyueth vs to rede in other chapyters how they may synne and yet synne not, erre and yet erre not / and redeth hys rydles hym self also so fondly, that an olde wyfe wolde be ashamed to rede suche redles so folysshely by the fyre syde amonge yonge chyldren. And yet in this one poynt whyther the chyrch maye erre or not, is in effecte all the hole mater and purpose of hys boke.
                  And fynally for all that euer he sayth / he leueth it in dowte whyther his repentaunt synners, syth he graunteth  that though they maye not synne yet they maye synne, and y• in lykewyse though they can not erre yet they can erre, be of thys electe chyrche of hys descrypcyon in these tymes onely in whyche they synne not nor erre not / or ellys in all those tymes to, in whyche they bothe synne and erre. And here speke I of suche synne as is of hys nature dedely, though the soule dye not by eternall dampnacyon therfore / bycause he repenteth that synne agayne ere he dye. And I speke of that errour also, whyche is of hys nature fynfull and damnable though the soule suffer not eternall dampnacyon therfore / bycause he repenteth that erroure afterwarde, and retourneth agayne to the trewth ere euer hys body dye.
                  Of all these dowtes the more parte he neuer moueth /  and suche as he moueth in other chapyters after, he so fondely soyleth, that all the worlde maye se that he nothynge seketh but corners to trepe in, where he maye luske and lurke in the derke / out of whych we shall I truste so bryng hym in to the lyght, that hys eyen shall dase to loke theron
                  But in the meane whyle thys ye se, that how so euer he mene by the electe chyrche of hys repentaūte synners, with all the felyng fayth that he can frame therto: yet syth men can neuer knowe whyche be they, there can no man haue any suretye by that chyrch of the trewe doctryne of god / no more then a man coulde by that vnknowen chyrche know whyche is the trewe scrypture of god. And therfore is this electe chyrche of Tyndals descrypcyon deuysed onely to

                  But yet that it can not onely do no good, but is also dremed out by hym to do myche harme: ye shall playnely perceyue, yf ye consyder what repentaūce and what fayth he meaneth. For these wordes wyll sowne very well in the erys of such symple soules, as do not whyle they rede them cōsyder what maner thynges Tyndale meaneth by them, and what thynge he calleth repentaunce and byleuyng in Cryste wyth a felyng fayth. But on the tother syde / he that consydereth that Tyndale wolde haue vs so to byleue in Cryste, that we shold set hys holy sacramentes at nought, and that we sholde byleue that all crysten people haue hytherto byleued wronge, that haue byleued that men ought  to be shreuen, or rec

                     nt that euer we were shryuen (for shryfte he calleth the false inuencyon of Sathan) and wolde haue vs also to be such as repent that euer they were of the ryght bylefe, and such

as wolde haue freres and nonnes repente theyr relygyon  and runne out and wedde togyther: he that consydereth thys, shall I saye se that Tyndals electe and chosen chyrche, is a chyrche of chosen heretykes, of contrary bylyefe to the chyrche of whyche saynte Hierom was a doctour, and saynt Austayne, and saynt Gregory, and saynte Ambrose, and all the other old holy fathers from the apostles dayes hytherto / or els muste Tyndale tell vs ones agayne, some one of all theym that byleued it lawfull, for a monke or a frere professed vnto perpetuall chastyte, to runne out of relygyon and go wedde a nonne.
                  Now am I glad yet that he cometh forth wyth repentaunce, at the leste wyse one way or other. For fayth alone was wont to do all thorow all a mannys lyfe. And when it was proued them by playne and euydent scrypture, that  fayth coulde not auayle wythout cheryte / then fell they to glose it and say, that fayth could neuer be wythout it. And then beynge therin repreued playnely by saynt Poule and saynt Iamys both / yet stande they styll by theyr worde,
                        1. Cor. 13.

                      & defende theyr wordes onely by wordes agaynst all reason, & agaynst the playne wordes of god not vnwryten whych they set not by, but the very wryten wordes in playne and euydent scryptures, for all that they saye they byleue no thynge ellys. And in that poynt I byleue them well and in more to. For where they say that they byleue nothyng but scrypture, I thynke they saye trewe / for they byleue no thynge besyde the scrypture, nor yet the scrypture neyther, as theyr owne wrytynges do full clerely declare.
                  But now syth they say styll that fayth alone suffyseth, and yet saye that there muste be cheryte to / and now saye there must be repentaunce to: they saye none other thynge in effecte, but y• it is mough to haue fayth alone yf a man haue other vertues to / and that it suffyseth to haue fayth alone, so that fayth be not alone: for and it be alone then is it no fayth at all. Is not thys a nother goodly rydle, wherby Tyndale techeth all thynge playnely?
                  Nor thys poynt wyll neuer be well patched wyth hys felynge fayth and hystorycall, as ye shall hereafter here when we come to the chapyter.
                  But yet agayn in the meane whyle, bycause he speketh of repentaunt synners, that they make the electe chyrche of Cryste: I wolde wytte of hym whyther one parte of repentynge

                      muste not be to repente heresyes. If not / then Crystes electe chyrche maye kepe them styll, and be a chyrche of heretykes. And on the tother syde, yf a man muste repente hys heresyes: then aske I Tyndale agayne, how shall an vnlerned man knowe whyche they be. The preacher shall tell theym sayth Tyndale. So saye we to. But what yf y• preachers do not agre therin / how shall he know the trewe preachers fro the false? Lette hym loke on the scrypture sayth Tyndale, and therby shall he iudge them by the ryght rule of the worde of god. But therto I saye, that, all thynge that we be bounden to byleue and obserue is not wryten in scrypture, as I haue in the thyrde boke more then playnely by the playne scrypture proued. And besydes that, vnlerned men are not able, nor euery lerned  man neyther, surely to dyscerne and iudge the trewe sence of the scrypture, in a greate thynge growen in debate and controuersye, where playne textes of scrypture seme to speke for bothe the sydes. And therfore it muste nedes be, that there is by god prouyded and lefte some such suretye, as maye brynge vs out of all suche perplexyte. And that is as I haue sayde, hys holy spyryte sent and lefte perpetually wyth hys chyrche, to lede it so by hys owne promyse euer into all necessary trouth,

                  But then sayth Tyndale, that it is trewe that there is all suretye in the chyrche of Cryste. But he sayth that the chyrch
                        •
                      of Cryste is onely the nomber of repentynge synners, that haue the felynge fayth whyche hym selfe descrybeth. Then we aske hym wherby shall a man knowe them, and be sure of them / so that he maye vse them for hys sure and vndoutable iudges bytwene the two contrary preachers, of whyche the tone is trewe the tother false.
                  It maketh no mater sayth he, though ye knowe them not. How shall I then be putte in surety by them, but yf I knowe that they be the chyrche wyth whom god promysed

to leue hys holy spyryte / and whom he wylled euery man  to here and to obay. ye shall perceyue it sayth he, by that ye se they be good men, and shewe the frewtes of fayth in theyr lyuynge. I can not be therby sure / syth an ypocryte maye fayne them. And also hym selfe graunteth after in hys chapyter, that they synne and yet synne not / so that though they synne not bycause of theyr felynge fayth, and theyr repentaunce folowynge: yet they maye ryght often do synne, in suche wyse that they maye do and in dede do many suche abomynable dedes, as men be hanged for and worthy for myche lesse / and suche that them selfe shulde for the same, sauynge for theyr felynge fayth be dampned in hell perpetually / from which none hystorycall fayth could kepe them, as Tyndale sayth.
                  Now then yf he saye trewe / it is impossyble for me to  knowe the electe chyrche of felynge faythfull repentaunte synners, to take the sure iudgement by.
                  Then yf he walke as it were in a mase, and come to the fyrste poynte agayne, and say it forcheth not, for they shall be decerned by the scrypture it selfe: that gappe haue I so stopped all redy, that he shall stycke styll at a stake & reste hys bones in y• busshes ere euer he gete out there. wherfore whē he shall se hym self vnable to defend hys owne chosen vnknowen chyrche, in y• poynt in which it sholde specyally serue, that is for y• sure techyng of the trew fayth: he shall then fynde none other shyft, but to loke whyther he myght make the catholyke knowen chyrche to fall in the lyke defawte / and shall aske vs how we do knowe the trew chyrch of Cryste, by whose doctryne we maye be sure of the ryght  bylyefe. where vnto we shall answere, that therin can no man be deceyued. For it is the comon knowen chyrche of all crysten people, not gone out nor caste oute. Thys hole body bothe of good and badde is the catholyke chyrche of Cryste, whyche is in thys worlde very sikely

                  Thys catholyke knowen chyrch is that mystycall body be it neuer so syke, whereof the pryncypall hed is Cryste. Of whyche body whyther the successour of saynt Peter be his vycar generall and hed vnder hym, as all crysten nacyons

                      haue now longe takē hym / is no parte of this questyō. For to this mater it is inough, y• thys body mystycall of Cryste this catholyk chirch, is y• body y• is animated, hath lyfe spyrytuall, & is enspyred with ye holy spyryt of god yt maketh thē of one fayth in the howse of god,

                  Of this chyrch can we not be deceyued, nor of the ryght faith can we not be deceyued whyle we cleue to this chirch / syth this chyrch is it in to which god hath gyuē his spyryt of fayth, & in this chirch both good & bad ꝓfesse one fayth.

And when they teche the cōtrary / then are they as I say reproued opēly by ye body / & eyther reformed & cured, or els cutte of fro the body and casten out therof. So yt this chyrch is knowen well inough / & therfore maye be well vsed as a sure iudge, for to decerne bytwene y• trew doctrine & the false, and the trew precher & false, cōcernyng the ryght fayth and the decernyng of the trew word of god wrytē of vnwryten, from ye coūterfete word of man / and in the decernyng of ye ryght vnderstādyng of the scrypture of god, as farforth as of necessyte perteyneth vnto saluacyō.

And yet can we not knw thē so neyther / for they may seme repentaūt openly, and yet thynke in theyr hartes full shrewdely, as they comēly do. Now wherby we shall be sure yt thys knowē catholyke chyrch, is y• very trew chyrch yt is to be byleued / & that no man may be surely byleued ye agreeth not with the fayth of this chyrche / all be it I haue both in my dyaloge & in sondry places of my .iii. formar bokes of this psent worke, well & playnly ꝓued you: yet shall

                  But now consyder in the meane whyle, that Tyndals dyffynycyon or descrypcyon of the chyrch, by whych he calleth it the nomber of all repentynge synners wyth all hys other cōdycyons adioyned therunto / is fyrst full of darkenesse. And when it is opened 
                        •
                      it agreed neyther wyth one chyrch nor other. And yet is it by another poynt of his own false doctryne, vtterly destroyed. For he techeth playnly, that who so euer do after baptysme synne onys of purpose wyllyngly, & not onely of wekenes and infyrmyte, he shall neuer be saued / but all his repētaūce after, though he trust neuer so myche in god, & haue after neuer so sure fayth in  hym, shall neuer serue hym to saluacyō but he shalbe fynally dampned as I shall shew you forther after. And then ye se playnly, that his dyffynycyon of hys electe chyrch, is by his owne doctryne destroyed. For the elect chyrch can not be the nōber of all repentyng synners y• truste to be saued in Crystes passyon, yf some suche repentyng synners shall neuer be saued by hys passyon as Tyndale playnly lyeth. And therfore syth he hath fayled of his dyffynycyon of the chyrche, and therby loste and spylled all hys purpose: lette vs now consyder whyther he handle any more wysely the remanaunt of hys goodly mater.

                  More.
                  I dowte not good reders but ye remember well, that all the doctryne of Crystes chyrche is full of warnynge, that no man sholde put a prowde truste and confydence in hys owne wurkes, nor onys thynke that he can of hym selfe alone without goddes gracious helpe, do any good wurke at all / and greate cause hath to fere and mystruste all hys owne workes, for vnperfyte cyrcumstaunces seldom perceyued by hym selfe. And also that in all that a man maye do he doth but hys onely dewtye / and that the beste worke were noughte worth to heuenwarde of the nature of the worke yt selfe, ne were it for the lyberall goodes of god, y•

                     pereth well that Tyndale varyeth not wyth vs for so farre / but that he meaneth a farre forther thynge, where he sayth that the electe chyrche trusteth so vtterly to be forgeuyn all synne & mocyons vnto synne, wythout any respecte of theyr owne deseruyng / & playnely meaneth therin (as in other places also he playnely declareth hym selfe, whyche I haue in my formar bokes proued and reproued) not onely that men shold not nede, but also that it were synne to go about any good wurke wroughte  wyth grace in fayth, to deserue any thyng toward the gettynge of full and perfayt forgeuenes.

And yet they say ye good wurkes be nought worth and therby make they y• tre of fayth lytell better. For what good tre can yt be, wherof ye good frute is noughte worth.

                  Now yf Tyndale answere, that the good workes be nothynge worth of them selfe, nor wythout fayth, as he answereth me in his answere to ye thyrd boke of my dyaloge:

then maye euery chylde se that he is dreuen to the harde  wall, & fayne to seke a shamfull shyfte. For what thynge is awght worth of yt selfe to heuenward, without goddes grace and the greate goodnesse of god? No fyry cheryte, though men wolde burne for goddes sake, coude deserue heuen of yt selfe wythout the lyberall goodnesse of god. For as saynt Poule sayth,
                        Roma. 8.
                      the passyons of thys worlde be not worthy to wynne the glory to come, that shalbe shewed vppon vs.
                  And yf he saye that good workes be nought worth, bycause they be nought worth without fayth / so myght he as well saye ye fayth were nought worth, bycause it is nought worth wythout cheryte. So that ye maye playnely se that he seketh nothynge but shyftes / whyche wyll yet serue of nought when he hath all together done.
                  
                  For ye maye fynally perceyue, that though euery man maye well fere that the workes which hym selfe hath done semed they neuer so good, were yet for some lacke vppon hys parte in y• doynge, so vnperfyt in the depe secret syght of god, that they were vnworthy to serue hym or be any thynge rewarded / and also that were they neuer so pure & perfyt, they were not yet worthy

                     uche rewarde but of goddes lyberall goodnesse: yet is it a very false fayth and a pestylent heresye, to byleue as Tyndale here techeth vs, y• god wyll saue suche as maye worke wythout any respecte or regarde vnto theyr deseruynge / as though he rought not whyther they dyd good or yll, but wyll saue all suche as hym lyste do they what they lyste, onely bycause hym lyste / and that hym selfe so lysteth for none other cause, but  onely bycause he hath so promysed and sworen.
                  For surely, neyther is the promyse the cause as I haue in myne other boke shewed / but ye goodnesse of god whych caused hym so to promyse. Nor also he hath not so sworne nor so promysed neyther, that he wyll saue man wythout any regarde of good wurkes / but hath bothe promysed & sworne the clene contrary, that but yf we wurke well yf we maye,

                      For he sayth that Peter ment by his wordes / we byleue that thou arte he that was promysed vnto Abraam, sholde come and blesse vs and delyuer vs. And yet he sayth, Peter wyste not by what meanes Cryste sholde delyuer vs. But nowe it is open he sayth thorow out all the worlde, that thorow the offerynge of hys body and bloude.
                  Now yf Peter at that tyme knewe not the thynge that muste now nedes be byleued, vppon payne of damnacion:

ye maye therby se that the fayth whyche Peter confessed  then, is not inough now for euery man to be saued by / but we be bounden to the bylyefe also of such thynges as god hath reueled and made open to be byleued vnto hys chyrche any tyme synnes. Or ellys muste Tyndale tell vs at what tyme god bade ho, and gaue vs leue to byleue hym no ferther, what so euer he wolde ferther saye to vs.
                  Consyder yet also that Tyndale agreeth, that the very trew crysten of hys electe vnknowen chyrche / do byleue the artycle of the perpetuall vyrginyte of our lady as soon as they be taught it, and knowledge theyr formar errour / wherby he graunteth that he whyche doth not so is no

                     e of the electes. Then saye I that theruppon it foloweth by hys owne wordes, that the artycle of the perpetuall virginyte of our lady is a necessary artycle of our fayth.
                  
                  And thus alwaye muste Tyndale vppon hys owne wordes, confesse that all the artycles reueled ferther by Cryste vnto hys chyrche, muste be byleued as fermely as the fayth taat was by Peter confessed / or ellys we be not onely dyscharged of the bylyefe of our ladyes perpetuall vyrginyte, whyche Tyndale is now yet broughte vnware to graunte for an artycle necessary syth it is now taught and knowen / but also of the bylyefe of Crystes deth, descencyon, resurreccyon, ascencyon, and of the godhed of the holy goste, wyth dyuerse other necessary poyntes mo.
                  But here it is to be consydered, that saynte Peter in cō
                     fessynge Cryste to be the sonne of the lyuynge god / dyd cō
                     fesse the very poynte wheruppon all the hole fayth hangeth. For in that poynte alone he confesseth that all hys  doctryne muste nedes be byleued for trew, and all hys cō
                     maundementes fulfylled. And theruppon it foloweth ferther, that syth Tyndale wyll byleue no more of hys doctryne then he can fynde wryten in the scrypture,
                        Iohā. vltimo.
                      where as the scrypture it selfe sayth that all was neuer wryten / nor wyll not also byleue and obaye Crystes chyrch accordyng to Crystes commaundement / nor wyll not so myche as knowe it,
                        Matth. 18.
                     
                     
                        Lucae. 10.
                      but fondely frameth an vnknowen, whom he for lacke of knowledge can neyther byleue nor obaye: yt foloweth I saye that Tyndale byleueth no pece of the fayth that saynte Peter confessed. And so he doth but pratle and prate of felynge fayth, wythout the felynge of any fayth at all, or any trewe bylyefe hystorycall or other.
                  
                     
                      And yet goth he forth in the boste of that artycle of the fayth, whiche as hym selfe confesseth was out of Peter his confessyon. For he sayth that saynt Peter was not ware of Crystes passyon when he made that confessyon.
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     That offerynge of Crystes body and bloude, is a satisfaccyon for the synne of all that repente, and a purchasynge of what so euer they can aske to kepe them in fauour, and that they synne no more.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Treuth is it that the passyon of Cryste and offerynge vp of hym selfe vnto hys father vppon the crosse, is a satysfaccyon for the synne of all that repente / so that we repente a ryght and effectually, by confessyon, contrycyon, and by  penytencyall dedes / reuengynge our synnes vppon our selfe wyth good workes of cheryte, ye more largely encreaced towarde our neyghbours, doynge frutefull penaunce, bryngynge forth the frutes of penaunce, and accordynge to the coūsayle of saynt Iohn̄ Baptyst,
                        Matthei. 3.
                      not sleyght frutes, symple, and syngle, but frutes good, greate, and worthy / and yet not of them selfe worthy, but suche as the satysfaccyon of Cryste maketh worthy, wythout whyche we coude no thynge satysfye / but wyth whyche we maye, syth hys pleasure is that we so sholde, and not so take his deth for so full satysfaccyon of all to gether, that we sholde therfore be carelesse and slouthfull to do any penaunce our selfe for our owne synne.
                  Tyndale wyll saye to thys that he can be content, that  we sholde do good dedes but not by waye of penaunce for our synne / and that we sholde somtyme fast and otherwyse afflycte our fleshe, to the entent to tame our fleshe agaynst the synne to come / but nothynge to punyshe it the more for any synne that is paste.
                  Now is thys teachynge of Tyndale myche lyke, as thoughe he wolde aduyse vs, be neuer the better bycause thou haste be noughte, do neuer the better bycause thou haste done euyll, runne neuer y• faster forth in vertue, bycause thou haste longe sytten styll in synne.
                  But saynt Poule agaynst Tyndals doctrine, ran forth the faster bycause he began later, and toke the more payne for the fayth, bycause he had ben a persecutour of y• fayth. And though he neuer thought thus, yf I hadde ben soner

conuerted I wolde haue done lesse good: yet had he thys  mynde, that bycause he began so late he wold do y• more / & bycause he had ben bad,
                        Roma. 6

                     And Cryste answered vppon thys rocke I wyll byelde my congregacyon / that is vppon thys fayth. And agaynst the rocke of this fayth, can no synne, no hell, no deuyll, no lyes, none errour preuayle. 
                           •
                        or what so euer any man hath commytted / yf he repente and come to thys rocke he is safe. And that thys fayth is the onely waye by the whyche the chyrche goeth vnto god, and vnto the enherytaunce of all hys rychesse / testyfye all the apostles and prophetes, and all the scrypture wyth sygnes and myracles, and all the bloud  of martyrs. And who so euer go to god and to forgyuenesse of synnes or saluacyon by any other way then thys / the same is an heretyke out of the ryghte waye, and not of Crystes chyrche.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Lo these wordes of Tyndale seme very gaye and gloryouse. But when ye shall well examyne them / as gaye as the hed glytereth wyth the pretexte of Crystes owne holy wordes, yet shall ye fynde the tayle of hys tale as poysened as any serpent. For where he bosteth and sayth, Agaynst the rocke of this fayth can no synne, no hell, no deuyll, no lyes, nor none errour preuayle / for what so euer synne any man hath commytted, yf he repent and come to thys rocke he is safe: ye maye not forgete that he meaneth all way, that he whyche repenteth and cometh to the rocke of thys fayth is safe for all hys synnes, wythout confessyon  or any endeuour thorow good workes towarde satysfaccyon / and so hys hole tale is a false heresye.
                  ye shall also consyder that hys tale hangeth euyll to gether / and the wordes by whyche he proueth that agaynste the rocke of thys fayth, there can no synne, nor no deuyll, nor none errour, preuayle, do not proue that poynte no thynge at all. For though it were trewe that he sayth, that what so euer synne a man haue commytted, yf he repente & come to the rocke of thys fayth he is saufe: yet myght the deuyll preuayle agaynst the rocke of y• fayth / syth it myght be that the deuyll myght brynge a man hauyng that fayth in to a dedely synne that he sholde happely neuer repente. And therfore yf Tyndale wyll bost that the deuyll can not

                      in any person preuayle agaynste the rocke of that fayth / but that the rocke of that fayth shall saue any man yt onys geteth vp theron: he maye not set If nor And therunto / but he must tell vs then, that eyther who so stande vppon that rocke shall not synne at all, or ellys that he shall be sure to repente hys synne, or fynally that synne he neuer so faste he shall be saufe inough whether he repente or not. For ellys may the deuyll preuayle agaynst y• rocke of that fayth, by bryngynge a man that standeth on it in to mortall synne whyche he shall neuer repent.
                  In lyke wyse where he sayth that none errour can preuayle agaynst y• rocke of this fayth, that saynt Peter there confessed: I wolde fayne wyt whyther he meane that who so euer onys byleue it, can neuer fall fro that bylyefe, nor  by any errour byleue the contrary / or els that a man maye fall fro it by errour / but then yf he repente and returne agayne therto he shall be saufe. If he meane in the fyrst maner, he muste then put away his If / and not saye yf he repente hys errour and retourne agayne to the rocke of that fayth, then he shall be saufe / for as mych as by that meanyng he shall neuer fall in errour, and therfore shall neuer nede to repente. But then mu
                        ••
                     e he proue vs by scrypture that pryuylege gyuen of god to euery man that hath onys goten that fayth / whych poynt he shall neuer proue whyle he lyueth, but that a man that hath it, maye by hys owne defaut, malyce, or neclygence, eyther at the instygacyon of the deuyll, or of suche heretykes as are warse then the deuyll, fall agayne therfro / as many hath done ere thys that  onys byleued full ryght, tyll the spyryte of pryde, enuy, and malyce, blowen into theyr hartes by the deuyll or the deuyls instrumentes, haue brought them in to the wronge.
                  Now yf he meane in the secunde maner, that is to saye that a man whyche hath that fayth may fall therfro / but for all that the gatys of hell can not preuayle agaynst any man that onys hath it, bycause he that falleth from it shall be saufe yf he repente hys errour and retourne agayn to it: yf he meane thus he sayth nothynge to purpose, excepte he saye whyche he shall neuer proue, that who so haue it and fall from it, shall be sure that he shall repente and retourne agayne / for ellys the gates of hell may preuayle agaynste hym for lacke of repentynge and retournynge.
                  And then yet forther, yf he saye whyche he shall neuer

proue that who so euer onys haue that fayth, yf he fall frō
                      it shall be sure to repente and retourne agayne
                        •
                      and so shall be saufe by repentynge: he muste then as I sayde before put awaye hys If / and not say yf he repente, but he muste saye boldely that he surely shall repente and retourne, and so by repentynge and fayth be saued.
                  And thus good reders ye se that thys man fareth as one that walked barefote vppon a felde full of thornys, that woteth not where to trede.
                  I wolde be very loth to myssetake hym, or wyllyngly to lette passe and dyssymule any sense that he myghte meane in hys owne wordes, by whyche hys sayenge myght be saued and be borne. But in good fayth, I se no ferther thyng that he myght po

And yf he meane so / yet sayth he then as false as any thyng can be false. For saynt Poule sayth playnely,
                        1. Cor. 13.
                      that he maye kepe fayth and yet fall from cheryte. whyche thyng yf Tyndale glose and say, that then hys fayth is dede, & a dede fayth is no fayth / and that therfore whyle he kepeth fayth he can not synne, bycause that when he synneth he kylleth hys fayth: I answere that though fayth by synne wax dede, it waxeth not  dede in the nature of fayth or bylyefe / no more then y• soule that dyeth by dedely synne, waxeth dede in y• nature of the soule, but is a quycke soule styll as he was before, though he be oute of grace / as the dede fayth is out of the lyuely workes of cheryte,
                        1. Timoth. 5.

                  But now yf he meane but so, that fayth is so stronge of it selfe for our saluacyon, that synne nor errour can not preuayle agaynste it, bycause fayth wyll alwaye preuayle agaynste them tyll some of them entre in and kyll it: thys were a goodly boste of hym to saye, that the chyrch be non

For Cryste sayed that vppon the rocke, that is to wyt vppon that fayth he wolde byelde hys chyrch, & that agaynst the rocke of this fayth the gates of hell shall not preuayle, that is to saye agaynste this fayth can no synne, no hell, no deuyll, no lyes, no errour preuayle / for there shall no synne nor no errour preuayle agaynste thys fayth but yf it kyll thys fayth.

Here were a goodly tale were it not? And syth that neyther thys may serue hym nor any that I haue towched before / and vtterly I can not diuine what he myghte mene ellys, takynge the waye yt he taketh, in swaruyng fro the knowē catholyke chyrche vnto hys vnknowen chyrche of electes, whom he calleth all repentaunt synners that byleue the fayth that saynt Peter confessed: I can not perceyue nor I trowe no man ellys, but that hys wordes wyll euyll stande to gether.

                  Tyndale.
                  
                     That thys fayth is the onely waye, by the whyche the chyrche of Cryste goth vnto god, and vnto the enherytaunce of all rychesse / testyfye all the apostles, and prophetes, and all the scrypture, wyth sygnes and myracles, and all the bloude of martyrs. And who so euer goth vnto god and forgyuenesse of synnes or saluacyon, by any other way then thys / the same is an heretyke out of the ryght waye and not of Crystes chyrche.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Lo here be lusty hyghe wordes eyther false or ellys of lytell effecte. For yf he meane that no man may go to saluacyon by any other thynge, wythout thys fayth that 
                        •
                     aynte

Peter professed / then be they trew. But then are they to no  purpose spoken, nor haue no place in thys mater, in which he reproueth the knowen chyrch, in that they go by confessyon, contrycyon, workes of penaunce, & workes of mercy, towarde the remyssyon of the dette of theyr payne and satysfaccyon. For hym selfe can not saye naye, but that we do all agre that wyth all that euer we can do, we can not gete forth one ynche to heuenward, without the fayth that saynt Peter confessed.
                  Now yf he meane not that waye, but that we be playne heretykes and oute of Crystes chyrche, yf hauynge that fayth that saynte Peter confessed, we go to heuenwarde wyth any other thyng bysyde then testyfye all the apostles and prophetes, and all the scrypture and sygnes and myracles, & all the bloude of martyrs: then Tyndale is a starke  heretyke in so sayenge. For all these wyll testyfye, that we muste byleue many thynges more then saynte Peter dyde there confesse / or ellys we shall not onely be dyscharged of byleuynge the sacramentes of penaunce, confyrmacyon, extreme vnccyō, order, and matrymony / but baptysme also and the sacrament of the aulter to. For of none of all these dyd saynt Peter make any mencion in his cōfessyon there / nor so myche as of Crystes deth neyther, wherof as Tyndale sayth he had at that tyme no knowlege. So that in Tyndales affermynge that the onely fayth there by Peter confessed, is suffycyent and the onely waye to heuyn: we shall haue Tyndale hym selfe to testyfye y• Tyndale hym selfe sayth vntrewe.
                  yet wolde I fayne in good fayth fynde and brynge it  forth, yf I coulde any thyng ymagine, that he myght seme to mene ryght / nor neuer wyll I wyttyngly for the preferment of my part, cōstrue myne aduersaryes wordes wrōg. And therfore, what yf we myghte vnderstande Tyndale thus, as though he ment that the fayth there confessed by Peter is for euery man suffycient / bycause that who so byleue that Cryste is the sonne of the lyuynge god, it can not be but that he shall byleue also that he is trewe in all hys wordes / and therfore he that so byleueth can not fayle to byleue therwyth / all that euer Cryst shall teche hym.
                  All be it that thys wyll not very fully serue hym, and also hym selfe speketh no thynge of it: yet is this as helpe me god the best glose that I can deuyse for hym. But now

                      doth hym selfe caste awaye thys defence / when he sayth in the seconde chapyter folowynge, that there is none errour noysome, but yf it be agaynste the promyses / so that in all other thynges he graunteth and affermeth playnely by expresse wordes yt a man may erre wythout any parell, euyn though that the trouth contrary to hys errour be wryten in holy scrypture, w
                        ••
                     che is a meruelouse worde in myne ere. For by thys ye may se, that he agreeth that a man may byleue yt Cryst is goddes sonne, & yet byleue the contrary of some thynges that Cryste shall tell hym, though he tell it hym in scrypture. And therfore he wyll ye se well none of my glose, bycause he wyll not stande in my daynger for it.
                  And in dede, all be it hym selfe shall for hym selfe neuer fynde a better / yet myne wyll not suffycyently serue hym  neyther. For a man myght byleue that Cryste were goddes sonne, and therby byleue also all that Cryste wolde teche hym. But yet myghte it be that he wolde byleue no more, then those thynges onely that Cryste wolde teche hym personally present wyth hym by his owne mouth. For though he byleued that Cryste were goddes sonne, and wolde byleue therfore all that he wolde tell hym: yet myghte he for all that mystruste and not byleue all other men, that wolde eyther in word or wrytyng tell hym a tale as tolde to them by Crystes owne mouth. ye & this myght he do, all though they preued it wyth myracles / yf he were of Tyndals stomake, that can as the Iewys coulde,

                  Thys myghte one do that byleued Cryste to be goddes sonne, and to haue redemed vs also by his bloud. And this doth in dede both Tyndale & Marten hys mayster, which byleue of Crystes wordes no more then is wryten / nor of the wryten wordes no more then they lyste / and the remanaunt but as they lyste, syth they draw them to what sense they lyste, agaynste all the olde holy doctours, and all the chyrche of Cryst. And thus it appereth yt neyther my glose nor any glose ellys, can saue Tyndals tale from playne pestylent heresye / bothe in that he sayth there nedeth no more to be byleued, and also in that he sayth that the bylyefe alone is suffycyente for saluacyon / and that yt

is heresye to saye that bysyde the bylyefe, any man vnto  saluacyon shold nede any thynge ellys. For though he put in for shame repentaunce therunto, wyth Iffes as ye se: yet shall ye perceyue as well in hys chapyters folowynge, as in thys same chapyter after, that he putteth fayth alone for suffycyent, and repentaunce as a shadowe that neuer can but folowe it. And yet all hys thynges euer so darkely, that he wolde fayne leue hym selfe some startynge hole.
                  But surely yt ys harde for hym to starte out fro these playne wordes of hys owne: who so euer go to god by any other waye, then thys fayth that saynte Peter confessed / the same is an heretyke out of the ryght waye, and not of Crystes chyrche. For thys is no more to saye, but who so euer bysyde the bare bylyefe, wyth as bare repentynge, adde confessyon, or for synne punysshe hym  selfe by penaunce, or doth the better after bycause he hath done euyll byfore, and hopeth that god shall eyther rewarde hym the more, or haue the more mercy on hym, or in purgatory punysshe hym the lesse: he is a starke heretyke. And of trouth so he is in dede yf thys false tale be trewe / and all trewe men, and all holy sayntes, and all holy scrypture false.
                  But now gothe he forthe, not in the profe but in the prayse, and sayth.

                  More.
                  whyche knowledge? the knowledge that a man nedeth no mo artycles in hys fayth now, then saynt Peter confesseth  then? and that he maye not bysyde repentaunce and bylyefe, vse any other waye to heuen / that is to wytte he maye not therwythall, vse as a waye to heuen or to remyssyon, any sacramentall shryfte, or penytencyall workes, or dedes of cheryte towarde satysfaccyon? The knowledge of thys fayth maketh Tyndale a man of the chyrche as he sayth. But of whyche chyrche trowe ye? truely not of the chyrch of Cryste, whych bysyde that fayth hath instytuted ye fayth in his blessed sacramentes & dyuers other artycles besyde / & which hath playnely declared yt all be it ye knowlege of hym & hys pleasure by fayth, be such a way toward heuen, yt without it we cā not come thyther: yet if we ioyne not to y• knowlege good dedes or purpose of good workes

                      neyther can that knowlege nor repentaunce neyther serue vs for a suffycyent waye to heuen. And therfore Tyndale is not by thys knowlege made a man of Crystes trewe chyrche / but syth he is content wyth the bare knowledge and setteth all good workes at so short, he is made therby a man of the false chyrch of the deuyll, that is a lyar hymselfe and father of all suche lyars.

                        . 1. And euery person of the chyrche is a member of Cryste. Ephe. 5. Now it is no member of Cryste, that hath not Crystes spyryte in it / as it is no parte of me nor member of my body, wherin my soule is not present and quyckeneth it. And then yf a man be none of Crystes, he is not of the chyrche.

                      Here Tyndale runneth in iuglynge, by equyuocacyon of thys worde chyrche. For where as hym selfe hath byfore thys tyme, confessed in wrytyng in thys same boke to whiche I answere now, that the chyrch in many places of holy scrypture is the hole multytude that professe the fayth of Cryste, whyther they be good or badde: here he fareth as though there were no man of the chyrche, but onely good folke alone in whom is the spyryte of Cryste / wyth an ensample put of the body, hauyng some dede parte hangyng theron, wherin were not the soule to quycken it and gyue it lyfe, whyche therfore he sayth is no parte of the body. But he forgeteth that somtyme there is some member astoyned and lacketh bothe lyfe and felynge / whyche yet by the reason that it is not clene cut of and caste awaye, receyueth  after lyfe and felynge agayne / as many a dedely synner doth in the body of Crystes chyrche take lyfe agayne, that hath in synne lyen full longe dede.
                  But now is he yet of thys mynde, that the fayth whych hym selfe hath descrybed, is the thynge that it onys goten and hadde of any man / kepeth in the spyryte of god so fast in hys harte, that he ys surely a quycke member of the chyrche that ys Crystes body / and that he can not lese that fayth nor that spyryte at any tyme after that he hath onys goten it / so that he haue it as he sayth in another chapyter after, felyngly and not onely hystorycally.
                  And who so euer haue not the fayth that he descrybeth hym, he rekeneth for an heretyke / and onely hys fayth for the trew, and the byleuers therof for the trew chyrche.
                  
                     Now hys fayth haue ye herde often inough, that onely  fayth suffyseth or at the leste wyse wyth repentynge / & that shryfte or penaunce toward heuen, or remyssyon of synnes is heresye / and that to wurshyppe the blessed sacrament of the aulter is dyshonour to god / and that there is no purgatory / and that frerys maye well & laufully wedde nonnes / and a greate rable of suche deuelysshe heresyes mo, of such maner suit and sort, that as our sauyour sayed vnto saynt Peter at the confessyon of hys fayth,
                        Matth. 16.
                      Thou arte blessed Symon the sonne of Ionas, For flesshe and bloude hath not reueled thys vnto the, but my father that is in heuyn: so wyll he saye to Tyndale, for confessynge of thys false fayth of his: Thou art accursed Tyndale the sonne of the deuyll / for neyther fleshe nor bloude hath taught the these heresyes / but thyn owne father the deuyll that is in hell. And thus well hath he quytte hym in thys chapyter.
               
               Here endeth the confutacyon of thys chapyter of Tyndale, whyther the chyrche can erre.

But as for the tone parte, that the trew membres of Cryste do synne / we shall not mych trouble hym wyth the profe (All be it in that he sayth that euery trewe member synneth and euer synneth, as he sayth in mo places thē one: yf he take synne for actuall synne as he muste here take yt, or ellys he speketh lytell to the purpose / men myghte peraduenture lay a blocke or twayne in hys waye, that wolde breke hys shynnes ere he lepte ouer it) But lettynge that parte passe / lette vs se how he proueth the tother, that a trew member of Cristes chyrch synneth not. Lo thus he proueth it.

                     Forthermore he that hath this fayth can not synne, and therfore can not be deceyued wyth damnable errours.

                  Here he telleth vs that no member of the electe chyrche of hys fayth can be deceyued wyth any damnable errour / and proueth it by that none of thē can synne. And in dede it foloweth, he can not synne, ergo he can not be damnably deceyued, syth euery damnable errour is synne. But now let vs se how he proueth hys antecedent, that no man hauynge that fayth can synne. He proueth it thus.
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     For by thys fayth we be borne of god. Now he that is borne of god can not synne, for his seed dwelleth in hym / and he can not therfore synne, bycause he is borne of god, the .3. chapiter of the fyrste epystle of Iohn̄. whyche seed is  the holy goste that kepys a mannes harte from consentynge to synne. And therfore it is a false conclusyon that M. More holdeth, that a man maye haue a ryght fayth ioyned wyth all kyndes of abomynacyon and synne.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Consyder now good reader, that Tyndale telleth vs here thre thynges, to proue therby that who so gete onys the fayth that saynt Peter confessed can neuer synne after.
                  The fyrste is, that by that fayth we be borne of god. The seconde is, that who so is borne of god, hath the seed of god in hym.
                  The thyrde is, that who so haue the seed of god in hym, can not synne.
                  Uppon these thre he concludeth, that who so gete onys that fayth can neuer synne after.
                  
                  Let vs now consyder the fyrste, where he sayth that by fayth we be borne of god. And therin dare we be bolde to tell hym, that though it be trew that by fayth we be borne of god as he now sayth: yet is it false that by onely fayth we be borne of god / as he falsely meaneth, and in many places as falsely for trouth affermeth, where he wolde make vs wene that bycause we be borne of god and become hys chyldren by fayth, we were therfore borne of god by onely fayth. As wysely as yf he wolde saye, that bycause he was bygotten by hys father / he was therfore bygotten of hys father onely wythout any mother.
                  And thys hys foly hym selfe so well perceyueth, that in many places he laboreth to couer it wyth sophystycacyon,

                      in vsynge thys worde fayth for fayth and hope to gyther, ye and somtyme for cheryte therwyth also / and then wolde make vs wene wyth suche wyse iuglynge, that fayth alone were fayth, hope, and cherite all thre to geder, bycause that ellys the fayth were but dede. And therin vseth hym selfe as wysely, as yf he wolde saye that the body alone eteth, drynketh, walketh, byleueth, loueth, and all to gether. And when hys foly were reproued / wolde then saye that he called the body alone the body wyth the soule therin, bycause the body without ye soule were but a dede body that coulde no thynge do.
                  And thus ye se that ye shall not nede to be deceyued by hys fyrste poynt, that we be borne of god by fayth.
                  Hys seconde poynt is, that euery man beynge borne of  god hath the seed of god dwellyng in hym. I wyll not here contende wyth hym, whyther the seed of god that dwelleth in the chyldern of god, be the holy goste, or the fayth, or the grace of god / nor in what wyse god and hys holy spyryte dwellen in good folke. But lettynge suche dysputacyons passe / thys wyll I saye, that yf the seed of fayth beynge onely fayth abyde in hym, it is not a thynge that shall so surely kepe hym frō synne, but that he maye synne dedely, and the seed of suche fayth stande styll wyth his synne / and the man for all the seed of suche fayth dwellynge in hym, may be by synne the chylde of the deuyll, and so maye dye and go to the deuyll
                        •
                     
                  
                  But yet ys the seed of fayth alone, that is to saye the bylyefe alone, a very greate occasyon of retournynge to god at hys callynge agayne by the offer of hys grace, and therby  to gete agayne bothe holsome hope and cheryte. But not so great an occasion therof, but that the man may kepe styll hys fayth and hys bylyefe alone, and wythout hope or cheryte eyther, by malyce or neglygence fyrste fall to synne, and after contynue styll in synne, and refuse ye grace of god yf he wyll / as well as the deuyll dyd in the begynnynge, and so doth euer styll, and wyll do styll in hell as longe as god dwelleth in heuen.
                  Now yf the seed of god in the crysten man, be ment hys grace by whyche men come to fayth, hope, and cheryte and do good workes wythall, not wythout the consent and applyeng of theyr owne fre wylles therto / such folke as haue vse of reason workynge wyth god for theyr pore parte towarde

theyr owne saluacyon, wyth the instrument yt god  of hys onely goodnesse hath made and gyuen them therunto / yf he meane that thys seed of goddes grace dwelleth styll in man, to kepe hym from fallynge to synne: I saye that it is very trew, as longe as man wyll cleue therunto & let his owne wyll worke therwith. But whē so euer he wyll withdraw his owne wyll therfro, to folowe the world, the flesshe, or the deuyll: then lyke as his wyll departeth from grace, so doth ordinarily ye seed of grace depart out of him.
                  Now yf he meane by the seed of god, that the spyryte of god dwelleth in the Crysten man by any other specyall maner of dwellynge, aboue such dwellyng as he dwelleth in other men by hys power and presence of hys godhed, then onely by his fauour & grace / which other speciall maner yf Tyndale meane any such, I can not cōceyue, syth I make  my selfe sure that he meaneth no suche dwellynge in vnyte of person, as the seconde person of ye godhed dwelleth with the manhode of Cryste: yet yf he deuyse and meane any other maner of dwellynge, by whyche the spyryte of god dwelleth wyth the faythfull man, I say that the spyryte dwelleth in hym and helpeth hym to contynue suche as longe as the man wyll by the applyenge of hys owne wyll contynue wyth the spyryte. But I saye that the man may by the frowardnesse of hys fre wyll, at the mocyon of the flesshe, or instygacyon of the deuyll, or entycement of ye worlde, hys fayth remaynynge / fall from cheryte, and put the spyryt from hym.

                      How be it a man may be so froward & obstynate in synne, & when he hath expelled god out of his hart, may dreue hym with synne vpon sinne and dispyghtfull cyrcūstaūces so farre of fro the dore, as some of these heretykes do (which in dispyght of vertuouse vowes of chastyte, rūne out & wedde nōnes & lyue in lechery / and in dispyght of y• lenton faste, eate flesh vpon good fryday / and in dyspyght of the blessed sacramētes of ye awter, cast the precyous body of Cryst out of the pyx) y• god shall iustely for ye hougenes of theyr abominaciō withdraw hym  selfe so farre, yt he shall peraduenture neuer approche nere vnto thē agayn, nor neuer after offer them hys grace. And then muste they nedes neuer cease fallynge tyll they come downe to the deuyll. Thus fynally concernyng hys seconde poynt / fayth alone may dwell in a man, and dedely synne togyther. But lyuely fayth, yt is to wyt fayth not alone, but coupled with hope & cheryte & wyll of good workes, can not dwell with dedely synne / neyther wyth manslaughter, aduowtry, nor any suche lyke / but as the tone cō
                     meth in, the tother goth out, whyther the synne be cōmytted of malyce, weykenesse, or frayltye / wherof Tyndale very styffely techeth vs vntruly yt cōtrary. And yet I say not that all synnes be of one wayght, concernyng the dyffycultye of returnyg to repētaūce, or ye degrees of payne in hell, after the finall impenytence or punyshement in purgatory  for lacke of penaunce here / but for that yf they dye before they retourne by grace and good wyll vnto penaūce, they be all perpetually dampned in hell the tone as well as the tother, though the tone not so mych as the tother, contrary to Tyndals aforesayd false cōclusyon / whose profe in that poynt specyally dependeth vppon hys thyrde artycle wherof the wordes be trew & hys vnderstandyng false. For hys thyrde poynt ye wote well is thys, that who so euer haue the seed of god dwellynge in hym can not synne.
                  Thys poynt ye remember he proueth, by the wordes of saynte Iohn̄ in the thyrde chapyter of hys fyrste pystle. whyche pystle is vndowtedly one of the moste harde and darke places of all the new testament / and wherof sundry

great heresyes haue rysen, & sondry mo there may, thorow  suche malycyouse myndes as rede the scrypture, to none other entent but to wreste euery word vnto y• worse parte / and of the playnesse and symplicite that the apostles vsed in the maner of theyr wordes, take occasyō to tourne theyr erneste godly sentence, into friuolouse cauyllacyons and sophysines / as not onely dyuerse heretykes haue done of olde, but also Tyndale hath now of newe, bothe renewed theyr olde & added some of his own, more pestylent & more folysh also then all the olde heretykes durst for very shame haue spokē of. And where as all ye olde holy doctours vsed alway to make open & expoune the hard & darke places of scrypture, by suche other as were playne clere & euydent: these heretykes alwaye for the profe of theyr heresyes, seke out the hardest places yt can be founden in scrypture. And  all the playne open wordes in whych can be no dowte nor questiō, they come and expoune by those places y• be darke obscure, & hard to vnderstand / mych lyke a blynd guyde, y• wolde when men were walkyng in a darke nyght, put out the candell and shew them the way by the lanterne.
                  This way vseth Tyndale vnyuersally, as well in euery other thyng yt he taketh in hand to proue, as in this poynt specyally / y• he which hath onys the fayth can neuer synne, bycause he hath ye seed of god dwellyng in hym. For where as it is euydent & playne by clere and open textes of scrypture, full & plentuouse in euery part therof, that there is no man here (excepte some specyall reuelacyon therof) so sure of his owne fynall saluacyon, nor of his own present estate neyther, but that he hath good cause to fere & temper hys  hope of goddys mercy with the drede of his iustyce, lest his ouer bolde hope may happe to stretche in to presumpcion & occasyon of sleyght regardyng synne: Tyndale wolde expoune thē all agaynst them all, by one darke text or twayn taken in this pistle of saynt Iohn̄ / by which he wold make vs byleue y• saynt Iohn̄ techeth dyuers of the most pestylent heresyes & most repugnaūt vnto god, and yt in hys iustyce and his mercy bothe, wyth the most occasyon gyuen vnto the world vnto the two most heyghnouse synnes and moste contraryouse in them selfe, that is to wytte presumpcyon & despayre, that euer any heretyke deuysed.
                  For he gathereth and affermeth vpon saynt Iohn̄s pystle, in hys false exposycyon, and also in hys foresayd begynnynge

                      of thys chapyter, that saynt Iohn̄ techeth them all these false heresyes folowynge.
                  Fyrste that who so euer haue onys the trewe fayth, can neuer after synne of malice or purpose / but that all the synnys that he can after fall vnto, shalbe but of wek

                  Secōdely yt of all such synnes he that hath onys at any tyme goten ye fayth, shall haue euer after the grace to repēt.
                  And thyrdely yt at the bare repentynge wythout shryfte or penaunce, he shall haue forthwyth forgeuenesse of all synne and payne / so that any satysfaccyon shall not onely no thyng nede, but is also as he sayth a dampnable thyng to do it, for hope or desyre towarde any remyssyon eyther  of synne or payne, and a dampnable e

                  For in hys exposycyon of ye fyrste pystle of saynt Iohn̄, he is come so mych ferther then euer he came before (as farre as I remember) yt there lyke as I haue shewed you byfore in the preface, he denyeth not onely purgatory but also all punysshement: here he techeth also that who so gete onys the trew fayth, which he calleth the felyng fayth, hath a sure vndowted knowlege that he is in the state of grace, and an electe that can neuer be dampned.
                  Now of these abomynable heresyes what bold occasyō 
                      of synne men may catche, and how they repūgne agaynste the iustyce of god. I referre it vnto the wysedome of euery good Crysten reder. Then techeth he on the tother syde, yt who so euer after hys baptysme had, & the story fayth, that is sayth he the fayth with whych we byleue the artycles of the fayth as men byleue a story or a cronicle, do any dedely synne of purpose / yt is to wytte as he sayth, not of wekenes or freyltye but of malyce or wyllyngly wyth a consentyng to the synne: y• man shall neuer after be forgeuen in thys worlde nor in none other. For euery such synne sayth he is the synne agaynst y• holy goste / which shall sayth he neuer be forgyuen, notwithstandynge any repentaunce and penaunce taken and done therfore.
                  
                     And to the profe of thys pestylent heresye, he draweth  the couert and obscure wordes of our sauyour Cryste in the gospell of saynt Mathew the .12. chapyter / and also the darke and hard wordes of saynt Poule.

Of whyche two thynges Tyndale the tone dyssymuleth, and the tother despyseth / and byleueth the olde heretyke Nouaciane the fyrsse authour of that abomynable heresye, better then saynte Cypryane, saynte Hyerom, saynte Austayne, saynte Ambrose, saynt Gregory, and all the olde holy sayntes that haue wryten agaynst it / and better then the hole catholyke chyrche  of Cryste of thys .xv. hundred yere, y• euer hath taught the contrarye, and euer syth the fyrst inuencyon of that heresye haue contynually detested and condēpned it, as one of the most execrable heresyes that euer ye deuyll deuysed.
                  For as Tyndals other heresye fyghteth agaynste goddes iustyce / so doth thys dyrectly fyghte agaynste hys mercy / and putteth almoste all crystē people in vtter despayre of heuen, yf men were so madde to byleue one heretyke or twayne, better then all the olde holy sayntes, and all the hole chyrche of Cryste.
                  Thys heresye as I began to tell you, Tyndale among hys other afore remembred, laboreth to stablysh / not onely by the darke and harde places of scrypture afore remembred, but also by certayne wordes in thys fyrste pystle of  saynt Iohn̄ / where is no more colour to speke therof then of the man in the mone, as euery man maye sone perceyue that redeth hym.
                  But now for our present purpose, to towch his heresies of thys chapyter of hys, of synnyng without synne / I shall touche you the place in that pystle of saynt Iohn̄, wherby Tyndale wolde proue you that who so gete onys the fayth whyche he calleth the trew fayth and the felyng fayth, can neuer synne dedely after. By whyche ye shall playnely se how playnely he mysseconstrewth the scrypture, to the myschyef of mēnes soules. The wordes of saint Iohn̄ be these Euery man that is borne of god doth not synne, for the seed of hym abydeth in hym / and he can not synne, bycause he is borne of god.
                  
                  
                     
                      In the vnderstandynge of these wordes varye Tyndale and we. And whyther he or we mysse vnderstande it, that let vs now examyne. Fyrst we shall I suppose agre to gether bothe that to be borne of god is in the scrypture no thynge ellys, but to be the chyld of god / and to be bo

                  we shall I thynke also agre to gether in thys that to be borne of god or to be the chyldren of god, is not mente to be hys naturall chyldren as our sauyour Cryste is by reason of hys godhed / but by fayth, hope, and cheryte

                  But herein peraduenture shall Tindale and we begyn  to vary, not onely for that I saye by the sacramentes and good workes, of whyche Tyndale wyll not here / but also for the electe chyrche y• is Crystes mystycall body, wherof goddes chyldren be membres here in erth. For all be it that he is so waueryng in his wordes that he woteth not where to holde hym, and therfore speketh so darkely that he wold be loth to be vnderstanden: yet he wyll call as it semeth no man a member of Crystes electe chyrche, but hym that is elected fynally to blysse and saluacyon.

                  But here sayth Tyndale, that who so euer haue onys

the fayth whyche he calleth after the felyng fayth / he hath  the seed of god, the spyryte of god in hym. And bycause he hath the spyryte of god in hym / therfore he sayth by the authoryte of y• aforsayd wordes of saynt Iohn̄, that man can neuer synne dedely. So that by that reason, who so euer haue onys the fayth, is one of the fynall electes.
                  Now se you in what maner Tyndale taketh these wordes. But agaynste hys takynge, 
                        •
                     tande all the olde holy doctours of Crystes chyrche, from the dayes of hym selfe and hys apostles hytherto. Of all whom, let Tyndale tell me the name of any one that euer dyd vnderstande these wordes of saynt Iohn̄ in such wyse as Tyndale doth / that who so euer gate onys the ryght fayth of Cryste, and put therwyth as greate a felynge therof wyth hope and cherite therto, as euer holy Tyndale hym selfe felte in hys dayes /  coude neuer after fall into dedely synne, or not so depe into it, that he myghte after be perpetually dampned in hell. Let Tyndale I saye tell me any one of the olde holy sayntes, that in thys exposycyon euer toke hys parte / and lette hym take all my teth and my tonge to.
                  Now yf neuer any good man vnderstode saynte Iohn̄ so byfore / but all holy men clene y• cōtrary / by what reason loketh Tyndale now, that we sholde now begynne to byleue hym alone, in the vnderstandynge of these wordes of saynte Iohn̄, better then all good connynge men thys .xv. hundreth yere before hym.
                  Now is hys exposycyō bysydes thys, not onely agaynst the catholyke fayth of all crysten people, and the playne determynacyon of Crystes chyrche / but also agaynste many  playne open places of holy scrypture bysyde / whych were in so playne and clere a mater almoste a loste labour to reherse. And yet leste an vnlerned reder myght happe to any thynge to dowte, I shall reherse you some.
                  what saye we by the wordes of the spyryte reueled vnto saynt Iohn̄, agaynste the bysshop of the chyrche of Ephesus / whom where as god praysed for many great vertues, in suche wyse that it appered that he was at that tyme in grace and goddes ryght specyall fauour, yet sayed he vnto hym, I haue for all this a few thynges agayst the, bycause thou hast lefte of thy fyrst cheryte. And therfore remember from whens thou arte fallen, and amende and do the good workes whyche thou were wont to do. For ellys wyll I

                  Doth it not here playnely appere, that he whyche hath goten so the fayth, and that the lyuynge fayth to, that he worketh so well therwyth that the lyght of hys faythfull lyuely workes shyne bryght before the face of god / maye yet by declynynge from that feruour of deuout workes, in to some slouthfull slaknesse though myche of hys vertue tary, fall yet so low at laste, that god shall reiecte hym and caste his candelstycke, wherof the lyght shall be worne out quyte out of hys place? If thys myghte not be / god wolde not tell hym, it bothe myght and excepte he mended shold.

For to those that stand he gyueth the counsayle to beware they fall not. whyche by Tyndale yf they onys in fayth fele them selfe stande they nede not, for they can not fall dedely. But saynt Poule there mente dedely falles, as bothe by hys wordes byfore and after appereth.

                  Here sheweth saynt Poule playne, that men maye haue the fayth and lese it / and that can they not I suppose with out dedely synne.
                  Peraduenture Tyndale wyll say, that he speketh onely of electys / and that I can not proue these textes to be spoken of electes. Therto saye I that he calleth euery man an electe, that is onely borne agayn of god by fayth, and that

byleueth to be saued by the meane of Cryste / and of suche  speke these textes, and therfore they speke of hys electes.
                  Then wyll he peraduenture say, that he meaneth of a felynge fayth onely. I know not what he meaneth by hys felynge fayth / but I wote well these textes speke of good fayth & lyuely fayth, that worketh wyth loue. If he fynde any other felynge let hym tell vs.
                  And yet yf there be any other felynge of fayth, then byleuyng, louyng, and workyng / the selfe same to, semeth by saynt Poule that it may be lefte of agayn and loste, as appereth by the same wordes of his in the syxte chapyter vnto the Hebrewys / of whyche wordes Tyndale taketh hys chyefe holde of the tother parte of hys heresyes,
                        Hebrae. 6.
                      that is to wytte that who so synne onys dedely after hys baptysme, shall neuer after be forgeuen. Saynte Poules wordes are  these. It is impossyble that they whyche haue onys ben illumyned, and haue tasted the heuenly gyfte, and haue ben made part takers of the holy goste, & haue tasted the good worde of god and the powers of the worlde to come, and be after all thys fallen downe / sholde be renewed agayne by penaunce, for as mych as they as mych as in thē lyeth, crucyfye agayne the sonne of god, and haue hym in derysyon.
                  Lo syrs where as Tyndale speketh of felynge fayth / saynt Poule speketh here of them that haue felte the taste therof. And where as Tyndale speketh mych of the worde of god / saynt Poule here speketh of them that haue felt the taste of the good word of god. And where as Tyndale speketh myche of beynge borne agayne of the spyryte / saynte Poule here in lyke wyse speketh of them yt haue receyued  the spyryte. And yet for all that they haue ben illumyned, and haue felte the taste of the celestyall gyfte, and ben part takers of the holy goste, and haue felt the swete taste of the good worde of god, & of the powers of the worlde to come: yet sayth he contrary to Tyndals techynge, that they may for all thys fall downe so farre into dedely synne, that it is impossyble for them to be renewed agayne by penaunce.
                  what hath Tyndale here to saye to saynt Poule? Surely for the defence of thys folysshe heresye, no thyng hath he to saye at all, that any good colour hath.
                  But when he shalbe fayne to gyue ouer thys / then wyll he comfort hym selfe wyth that that saynte Poule here semeth to ferther hys other heresye, that euery dedely synne

                      after baptysme sholde be irremyssyble.
                  But out of that comfort shall I dreue hym shortely, For I am sure the places of holy scrypture wryten all by one holy spyryte, varyeth not in sentence. And where as these wordes, as well appereth by the olde holy wryters, be full of hardynesse and dyffycultye: yet that the sentēce can not be such as may serue Tyndals heresye, yt shall we, leuyng all theyr exposycyons whyche are all clene agaynste hym, make hym open and euydent, by the playne & clere wordes of the holy prophete Ezechyell, whose wordes lo be these in the .xviii. chapyter.

                      & kepe all my cōmaūdementes, & deale iustely & ryghteously: he shall lyue, and shall not dye. Of all ye iniquitees that  he hath wrought I wyll none remēber: in y• ryghteousnes whyche he hath done shall he lyue. Is it my wyll sayth the lorde god, that the wicked man shold dye, & not rather that he sholde be conuerted from hys wayes & lyue? But truely yf the ryghtuouse man turne hym selfe awaye from hys ryghtuousnesse, & worke wyckednes in any of all those abominatiōs which the wicked man is wont to worke shall he lyue? Of all y• ryghtuousnes yt he hath done, shall none be remēbred. But for the offence which he hath cōmytted, & in the synne that he hath done / for those shall he dye.
                  Lo syrs here is more then I promysed. For here be both his heresyes destroyed at onys. For god here by the mouth of this holy man, promiseth without any maner excepcion, yt when so euer the wycked man wyll turne, he shalbe takē 
                      to grace. And in lyke wyse when so euer ye ryghtuous man synne, his formar ryghtuousnes shall not saue hym from dampnacyon. And this sentence our lorde hath set so sure, that he repeteth it agayne in ye .xxxiii. chapyter in this wyse.
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      The ryghtuousnes of the ryghtuous man shall not saue hym in what daye so euer he synne. Also when so euer the wycked man turne from his wyckednes / it shall not hurte hym. And the ryghtuous man can not lyue thorowe hys ryghtuousnes, in what daye so euer he synne.
                  Here haue ye good reders hard this sentence by y• word of god in thys one holy prophete, dowble cōfermed & therby Tyndals dowble heresye dowble also condempned.
                  And yet lest Tyndale myghte say, why sholde you not as well expoune and glose Ezechyel by saynte Poule, as

saynt Poule by Ezechyel, namely syth saynt Poule came  after, and therfore of goddes mynde maye tell vs ferther: it apereth I saye that our lorde wyll not that these wordes of Ezechiel be glosed by any other wordes, though they be spoken by god hym selfe / but that his other wordes yf they seme contrary, shall be rather expouned by these. And therof he gyueth vs open warnynge in hys wordes folowynge and sayth.
                  
                     
                        Ezechiel. 33.
                     ye and though I wolde saye to a ryghteouse man that he shall lyue, and he then trustynge in hys ryghteousenes commytte and do wyckednesse / all hys ryghteousnes shall be forgottē / and for the iniquyte whyche he hath wrought, for that he shall dye. But yf I saye to a synner, Thou shalt dye / and he then repenteth hym of hys synne, and doth iugement and iustyce, and that the same wycked man restore  the pledge that he hath of an other man, and also make restytucyon of stollen goodes, and walke in the cōmaundementes of lyfe, and do nothynge that is vnryght: he shall lyue, and shall not dye but be saued, and none of all the synnes which he hath commytted, shalbe layed to his charge. Iugement and iustyce hath he done, and therfore shall he lyue and not dye.
                  Lo good crysten reders, here se we very playne, that we were farre vnwyse yf we wold folowe the foly of Tyndale, eyther in bolde presumptuose hope or folysshe ferefull despayre / eyther wenynge that after any felynge fayth onys had, any dede that we coulde after do, coulde be no dedely synne / or y• for any dede done after our baptysme, we could be penaunce neuer be saued after. we maye be very sure, that as saynt Poule playnely reproueth the tone, and ys harde to perceyue what he meaneth in the tother: so that he meneth not as Tyndale telleth vs, we may well know / not onely by all the olde holy doctours and sayntes that expoune saynt Poule, in that he sayth it is impossyble to be renewed by penaunce, that it is impossyble to be by penaunce renewed vnto the state of baptysme. And by that exposycyon they destroye yet a thyrde heresye of Tyndale, concernynge hys full remyssyon of synne and payne and all forthwyth as soone as he repenteth / but also be we well lerned here by the prophete Ezechyell, that all though yt maye peraduenture be, that a man maye go forth in synne so farre, that he shall neuer haue grace of

                      repentaūce after offered vnto hym, & for that cause ought euery man stande in greate fere to synne how greate fayth so euer he fele / yet yf we begynne onys to repente, we may be sure that god offereth grace & wyll perfyt our penauns wyth encreace of his grace, and wyll perdone the deth dew for our dedely synne, but yf we fayle on our parte to go forwarde wyth hys grace, and that we folyshly fall therfro.
                  Now agaynste all these euydent places of scrypture playnely contrary to Tyndals exposycyon / what thynge hath Tyndale to defende his exposycyō wythall? If he name any men / he shall name you none but a fewe knowen condempned heretykes, agaynst all holy doctours & sayntes and the catholyke fayth of all crysten people. If he pretende any places of scrypture / he shall alledge a few darke  hard and obscure, or no thyng pertaynynge to the mater, agaynste a great many manyfeste, playne and euydent, & clerely prouynge hys exposycyon false.
                  Fynally ye shall fynde that the hole purpose of saynte Iohn̄ in that pystle, no thynge maketh in thys worlde for Tyndals entent, but rather clerely the contrary.
                  For saynt Iohn̄ entended there, not to shew them, that who so is onys good can neuer after be badde, as Tindale sayth he ment / but vtterly to gyue all the world warnyng, that be men at one tyme neuer so good, yet when so euer after they do noughte they be nought, and by theyr euyll doyng lese theyr goodnes. And lyke wyse as byfore whyle they byleue well and worke well, they be all that whyle borne of god, & be goddes chyldren, and haue his seed in  them: so when so euer they fall from fayth to heresyes, or from good workes to dedely synne, then lese they the seed of god and be borne of the deuyll & become hys chyldren.
                  And that saynte Iohn̄ in thys poynt ment none other then thus / the hole processe of hys pystle one parte compared wyth an other, doth more then playnely declare. For he sheweth that ye deuyll ys the father of euyll folke, and they hys chyldren by folowynge hym in theyr synfull workes / as our sauyour sayd to ye iewes ye be of your father the deuyll, and hys desyres wyll ye do.

                           .
                      And the son of god sayth Saynt Iohn̄ came in to this worlde and here appered, to dyssolue and breke the workes of ye deuyll. And euery man that is borne of god, that is to saye that ys goddes chylde doth not synne, bycause ye seed of god abydeth in hym / and

he can not synne bycause he is borne of god and is goddes  chylde, as though he wolde say, for yf he fall to synne, then ceaceth he to be borne of god and to be goddes chylde, and begynneth to be borne of the deuyll and to be hys chylde.
                  And therfore it foloweth forthwyth in the texte, By this be the chyldern of god and the chyldern of the deuyll open. That is to saye, by thys maye ye se who be the chyldern of god and who the chylderne of the deuyl. For he that is not ryghtuouse is not the chylde of god, nor he that loueth not hys brother. And after he sayth, euery man that hateth his brother is a manqueller / and ye knowe that no manqueller hath euerlastynge lyfe abydynge in hym.
                  Lo good reder, where as he sayd byfore that the chylde of god can not synne, bycause he hath the seed of god abydynge in hym: here he sayth for all that, who so euer hate  hys brother is an homicyde, and therfore hath not euerlastynge lyfe abydynge in hym. whyche is the thynge that he before called the seed of god, whyther he ment therby lyuely fayth, grace, or the spyryte of god. Of whyche thre the fyrste two be the begynnynge and the entre in to euerlastynge lyfe, whyche shall be perfyted by glory / and the thyrde is hym selfe euerlastynge lyfe of hys owne omnipotent nature.
                  And thus haue he the seed of lyfe neuer so stronge and sure at one tyme whyle he is the chylde of god: yet when so euer he falleth after to the hatered of hys brother, he leseth that lyfe by the commyttynge of dedely synne, and becometh the chylde of the deuyll.
                  To thys wyll Tyndale peraduenture say, that I passe  ouer and dyssymule the wayght of saynt Iohn̄s wordes yt he allegeth, and that I wynke and wyll not perceyue how playnely they proue hys purpose. For though it be trewe that when so euer a man hateth hys brother, he is an homicyde and synneth dedely, and hath not euerlastyng lyfe nor the seed of god abydynge in hym: yet foloweth it not wyll Tyndale saye, that he that hath onys the felynge fayth, & therby is borne of god, and therby hath the seed of god in hym, may synne dedely and lese the seed of god. For he can not lese it but by synne. And the seed of god onys beynge in hym / he can not bycause of that seed be suffered to hate hys brother of purpose, and so to do dedely synne and lese the seed of lyfe / but euer is he by the strength and vertue of

                      that seed of euerlastynge lyfe, preserued from all fallynge in to dedely synne. And that I proue (wyll Tyndale saye) by the playne and open wordes of saynt Iohn̄ before alledged / where he sayth that he that is borne of god can not synne, bycause he hath the seed of god abydynge in hym. He sayth not as longe as he hath it / but he sayth he can not synne bycause he hath it. Sygnyfyeng playnely yt he can neuer synne, bycause he hath the thynge in hym that wyll neuer suffer any dedely synne to entre. And the reason that is made agaynst me vppon other wordes of the same pystle, auoydeth (wyll Tyndale saye) myne exposycyon nothynge at all. For lyke wyse as it is made agaynste a man onys borne of god, to proue that he maye be after borne of the deuyll: it may as well be made of any angell in heuen.  For yf any angell in heuen wolde fall from the loue of god into malyce / he sholde be turned from an angell in to a deuyll. But lyke wyse as that case can neuer fall, bycause the seed of god is in that angell / whyche so kepeth hym & euer shall that he can not haue that euyll wyll so to do: so doth the seed of god onys entred wyth the felynge fayth in to a soule, so preserue it & kepe it by the myghty power of that seed, that that soule can not fall in to that malycyouse wyll that maye make any dede of hys to be dedely synne. And y• thys is so, I saye yet agayne y• the wordes of saynt Iohn̄ whyche I haue before alledged, do very playnely proue / in that he sayth that who so is borne of god can not synne, bycause he is borne of god, and bycause he hath the s
                        •
                     ed of god abydyng in hym. And he sayth after in a nother place  of the same pystle, that he whyche is borne of god / hys generacyō (that is to wytte hys beynge borne of god by the seed of god,

                  In thys wyse wyll Tyndale peraduēture answere me. And surely I can my selfe deuyse no more effectuall wordes that he myghte speke for hys parte / for in good fayth yf I coulde I wolde. For neuer wyll I purposely leue his parte any more fayntely defended thē myne own, as farre as my selfe can se any thynge that hym selfe myghte saye.
                  But now to thys answere. we shall tell hym agayn that bytwene man & angell is there almoste as greate dyfferēce in thys mater, as there is bytwene them in theyr substaūce and nature. For the blessed angellys that stode styll wyth

god in the deuyls fall, were forthwyth so surely confermed  in grace, that they can neuer fall in to synne after, nor do any thynge wherof god wyll commaunde them the contrary. And of thys in them be we sure in fayth, by the worde of god taught vnto hys chyrche / and they sure in knowledge by hys promyse made vnto them wyth hys worde, whyche he by a meane to vs not imagynable continually speketh vnto them, in the contemplacyon and byholdynge of hys almyghty godhed. But as for man / we fynde no such promyse made vnto hym, that when he is ones good, he can neuer after waxe nought. But we fynde in scrypture the cō
                     trary, as I haue by playn scrypture proued all redy before
                  we se also that the catholyke fayth of all crysten people is to the contrary. For all crysten people excepte a few heretykes, both now byleue and all thys .xv. hundred yere before  euer haue byleued, that good men & chyldren of god maye fall in to dedely synne, and become chyldern of the deuyll / and yet aryse by grace thorowe penaunce, and be made the chyldern of god agayne.

                  we fynde also playne ensamples, both in scrypture and at our owne eyes, of many vertuouse chyldren of god, that haue fallen from that estate, & becomen by synne the chyldren of the deuyll.
                  For lettynge passe ouer Iudas, that from the chylde of  god and from an holy apostle torned in to the traytour of god & chylde of the deuyll of hell: we haue seen ouer many in our owne dayes, in whom we haue had experyence of ye lyke. As of frere Luther, frere Huskyn, Otho the monke, Pomerane the preste, & frere Lambert. For as for Swynglius, I neuer herde of any good vertue in hym. But all these other were the good chyldren of god onys, at suche tyme as grace and deuocyō brought them in to relygyon. And yet can now no good man dowte, but by the breche of theyr holy vowys and promyse made to god, and rūnynge out in apostasye, and lyuynge in lechery vnder pretence of matrymony / & for theyr more corage & boldenesse in suche bychery, to bere it to better out shamelesse wyth vngracyouse

                      company, makynge a shamefull secte therof and an abomynable heresye, they be now fallen from Cryste, and haue expelled the seed of god out of theyr hartes by synne very deuylysh dedely. And yet dare I not despayre of any of all these, nor of Tyndale hym selfe neyther. For all hys owne rule, wherby he techeth that they whyche wyllyngly synne, and of purpose malycyousely impugne the knowen trouth, as they and he do, shall neuer come to grace of amē
                     dement nor ought not to be prayed for: yet dare I neyther I saye despayre of any of them nor of hym selfe neyther / but hope yet and praye both, that god maye amende them all, yf none of them de dede in theyr synne and gone to the deuyll all redy.

                      & beware that he fall not in to idolatry. whyche he myghte haue boden all goddes chyldrē care neuer for, yf they were  as Tyndale sayth sure by theyr felyng fayth, y• they could neuer fall therto, bycause the seed of god was onys wyth in theym.
                  But as I sayd before, Tyndale in these wordes of saynt Iohn̄ taketh occasyō of the symplycyte vsed in the maner of speche in holy scrypture, to make cauyllacyons and seke out sophysmes vppon euery worde. And where as saynte Iohn̄ sayth, that the chylde of god can not synne / menyng not precysely that he can not synne dedely by any maner meane, but that it is a greate occasyon to kepe hym from synne, & that he y• doth dedely synne, is not goddes chylde but the deuyls: Tyndale affermeth hym playnly to mene, that he whyche ys onys goddes chylde can neuer synne dedely after. As though euery man that wolde say, an honorable

mannes chylde and vertuousely brought vp, can  not fall to shamefull vycyouse lyuynge, for hys good educacyon shall brydle hym, and drede of shamynge hym selfe and hys frendes muste nedes refrayne hym / myghte not meane by these wordes that the yonge man sholde haue a greate occasyon to contynue good, but muste nedes meane that it were impossyble for hym to be other then good / and that he neuer coulde after forgete hys bryngynge vp, and shake of shame and fall to nought.
                  Or yf one wolde saye, a man that taketh hys wyfe for very loue, can neuer fall to aduowtry, y• loue that he hath to her must nedes kepe hym to her / nor she can not for very shame begyle hym, for the loue that he bereth to her. Do not folke speke in such fasshyō? And yet though they mene that these thynges be great occasyons to contayne the partyes  in faythfull matrymony, they mene not that it can neuer happen otherwyse.
                  In suche maner of whyse meaned saynt Iohn̄ in those wordes, when he sayd he that is borne of god synneth not, for he hath the seed of good in hym / and therfore he can not synne, bycause he is borne of god / he ment I saye, not that it is impossyble for hym to synne dedely, but y• it is a great helpe and occasyon to kepe hym from dedely synne.
                  yet wyll not Tyndale let to stycke styll in hys errour, & saye that saynt Iohn̄ playnely ment, that it is impossyble for hym to synne that hath the seed of god in hym. For he sayth that he whyche onys hath the seed in hym, can not synne after dedely by no maner menys, bycause he hath the seed of god in hym onys.
                  
                  To thys I saye that in y• sample that I before dyd put, neyther the man nor the wyfe that come to gether for great loue can fall to aduowtry, bycause the loue whyche is in eche of them towarde the other, can not suffer it. And truth it is as longe as it lasteth & endureth in them. But eyther of them both yet, may so farre fall in loue with some other, that the hote loue whych they had bytwene them selfe, may cole and clene be quenched / as is the fyre wyth castynge on water inough.
                  Saynt Iohn̄ therfore wrytynge those wordes, and vnderstandynge as in dede he doth, not after a sophystycall fasshyon, yt it were vtterly impossyble for hym at any tyme after to synne dedely, that hath onys ye seed of god in hym / 

                      but well and resonably menyng after the comon maner of spekyng, y• it shalbe a great occasyō for hym to abyde good styll, & that as long as the man kepeth y• seed of god (whyther saynt Iohn̄ toke it for lyuely fayth, grace, or the spyrit of god) & cleueth there vnto, so longe he can not synne dedely: saynt Iohn̄ I say so sayeng & so menynge, spake as bycame the ryght euāgelyst of Cryst.

                      that is to wit y• who so euer is onys borne of god, neyther shall synne after dedely nor neuer can, bycause y• seed of god is in him able to preserue the man & to kepe out synne / speketh as wysely as yf he wolde fyrst make me this argumēt: He y• turneth y• spyt sitteth by the fyre / but he that sitteth by the fyre can not be a colde, bycause  he hath a good fire by hym: ergo he that turneth the spyt can not be a colde. And when he had made vs onys this argument, wolde then wene he had playnly proued, y• who so euer had onys turned the spytte, coulde neuer be a colde after in all his lyfe. For surely after Tyndals vnderstādyng of saynt Iohn̄s wordes, the reason is mych lyke. For lykewise as while a man sitteth by the fyre he can not be a cold, bycause y• fire is by hym that kepeth hym warm: so while the seed of god is in the man he can not synne, bycause the seed of god beynge i
                        •
                      hym doth kepe & preserue hym from synne. But lyke wyse as the broche turner that sitteth warme by the fire, may let the spitte stande, & suffre the mete to burne, and walke himselfe out in the snow tyll his teeth chater ī his hed for colde, and neuer cathe hete agayne  but fall starke dede on the grownd: so he yt is onys goddes chyld, & hath the seed of god in hym, & therfore cā not synne dedely as longe as he kepeth it and cleueth faste vnto it, may by the foly & frowardnes of his owne fre will expell the seed of god, & reiecte his grace, & neclecte his holy spyryte, and fall to dedely synne, & continue therin, & dye therin, & go to the deuyll therin to.
                  And so as it is trewe to saye, that he which hath a good fyre by hym can not be a colde, menyng therby as long as he kepeth hym by it: so is it trew to say, that who so haue ye seed of god in hym can not synne dedely, menyng thereby as longe as he kepeth it. And thus ment saynt Iohn̄.
                  And as he that wolde say who so sitteth by the fyre can neuer be a cold, menyng therby that he could neuer go frō the fyre & so cathe, cold after, were a very starke fole: so he

that wold say that who so haue the seed of god in hym can  not synne / menyng therby that he could neuer after lese y• seed, by the foly or frowardnesse of his owne wyll, & therby synne dedely and be dāpned to, were mych more then mad. And syrs thus meneth Tyndale / and wold make vs all so wyse, as to wene that saynt Iohn̄ ment so to / wherof we se playne the contrary, not onely by many other playne places of scrypture, but also by many other places of saynte Iohn̄ in the selfe same pystle, wyth all the olde holy sayntes that euer expouned that pystle of saynt Iohn̄.
                  And syth Tindale so styffely stycketh in this poynt, that the seed of god onys had in a mānes harte, doth kepe hym for euer after frō euery dedely synne: let hym tell vs wherfore it kepeth hym not for euer from euery dedely synfull dede. For Tyndale sayth hym selfe, that though the seed  shall kepe hym from all dedely synne / yet it shall not kepe hym frō aduowtry, nor manslaughter, nor such other horryble dedes, as poore vnlerned people in some contreys be wont to call dedely synnes.
                  And therfore good crysten reders, I shall in this poynt ende wyth the good holsome counsayle of saynt Iohn̄, by whych in the selfe same pystle agaynst Tyndale, expressely he byddeth vs all beware of all suche heretykes, as wolde make vs wene y• some were goddes wanton cokneys in such a speciall wyse, yt what so euer they do no thyng could displease hym / & some other so lytell set by and so farre out of hys fauour, yt no repentaūce, no penaūce, no fayth, none hope, no loue of god and theyr neyghbour, coulde brynge them in his fauour. Agaynst which fond and frantyke imagynacyō
                      / saynt Iohn̄, though he say who so euer cōfesse yt Iesus is ye son of god dwelleth in hym & he in hym: yet he warneth vs well and playnely, yt he wolde no man sholde begyle vs, and make vs wene that wyth y• confessyon and that bylyefe alone he were a good man / but sayth, by thys shall ye se who be chyldrē of god, and who chyldren of the deuyll / for he yt is not ryghtuous is not of god. And sayth also, lytle chyldrē let no man begyle you / he yt doth ryghtuousnesse is ryghtuous, and he yt doth synne is of ye deuyll.
                  Now may we clerely perceyue, that these onely wordes of saynt Iohn̄ vtterly destroye Tyndals heresye, groūded vppon hys false exposycion of saynt Iohn̄s other wordes. For when saynt Iohn̄ sayth here hym selfe, that the chyldren of god and the chyldren of the deuyll be manyfest and

                      open by theyr outward workes: how can that stande with Tyndals exposycyon and hys heresye dependynge theruppon, by whyche he sayth that the trew membres of the elect chyrch, may fall into the doyng of horryble dedes, thorowe the frute of the synne remaynyng in theyr membres, & vppon great occasyons brekyng out of theyr membres / & yet for all those horryble dedys done by them they be the chyldren of god styll, & neuer become ye children of ye deuyll for all ye doing of theyr horrible dedes, bycause they do thē not of malyce nor of purpose, but of fraylty onely & weykenes.
                  ye se good reders openly, that yf Tyndale in thys hys heresye & false exposycyon of saynte Iohn̄ sayd trew / then sholde saynt Iohn̄ hym selfe say vntrew, where he sayth yt by the outwarde dedes,1. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . the chyldren of god and the chyldren  of the deuyll be made manyfest & open. For they were not open by the dede, yf notwythstandyng the most horryble dedes yt coulde be deuysed, yet theyr secret vnknowen fayth & frayltye dyd euer kepe it secrete hydde & vnknowē, whyther they were at the dede doyng y• chyldren of god or the deuyll. And therfore where as Tyndale wold make vs wene, y• hym selfe & hys holy felowes had by theyr felynge fayth the spyryte of god, in such a specyall maner entred in to theyr holy brestes, yt none of theyr abomynable dedes coulde be any dedely synne, bycause yt the spyryte sayth he dwelleth styll within them: saynt Iohn̄ sayth in the very ende of that thyrde chapyter, who so kepeth goddes commaūdemētes, in hym god dwelleth. And by that marke we know sayth saynt Iohn̄, y• there is dwellynge in vs of the  spyryt yt he hath gyuen vs. By whych wordes he declareth clerely, yt when these holy heretykes breke his cōmaūdemē
                     tes, by those horryble dedes which Tyndale hym selfe confesseth y• they do, & as all the worlde seeth frere Luther do, in weddyng the nūne, wyth the brech of theyr both vowys agaynst the cōmaundemēt of god, which hath in holy scripture expressely cōmaunded them to kepe and fulfyll theyr vowys: saynt Iohn̄ I saye declareth agaynste Tyndals doctryne clerely, that when we se suche dedes in them, we maye well perceyue by them that there is at that tyme neuer a whyt of goddes good spyryte in them.
                  But now no man dowteth whyther of the two, better vnderstode saynt Iohn̄ / whyther Tyndale or saynt Iohn̄ hym selfe. And therfore good crysten readers, whyle ye se

that these holy fathers and authours of these heresyes, prechynge so sayntly of theyr felynge fayth, boste them self and theyr felowes for the sure chyldrē of god, that bycause of the spyryte can neuer synne of purpose, and therfore neuer synne dedely, but be certayne and sure of grace and saluacyon / and yet ye se for all this, that beyng professed mū
                     kes and freres, they fall to the fleshely felynge of nōnes, of longe purpose, and styll perceuer therin, & fynally dyuers dye therin to: ye maye byleue here saynte Iohn̄, that saye they what they wyll, they be the deuyls chyldren in dede, & all theyr holy doctryne is vtterly no thynge ellys but very frantyke blasphemy.
                  And therfore fynally, where as Tyndale knytteth vp all hys mater wyth a quyppe agaynste me, and sayth that bycause euery man that onys hath the ryght fayth is born  of god, and therby hath the seed of god in hym, whych preserueth hym so that he can neuer synne / therfore it is sayth he a false conclusyon that M. More holdeth, how a man maye haue a ryght fayth ioyned wyth all kyndes of abomynacyon and synne: ye se now that hys owne conclusyō is so clerely proued false, that it letteth my conclusyon no thynge at all. And yet shall I forther towche hys quyppe where it shall haue better place, after that we shall come to the chapyters, in whyche he shall open and declare hys vttermost what he calleth fayth. But fyrste wyll I consyder a lytell hys ferther progresse in thys chapyter, in whych he goth forth in thys wyse.

                     yble dedes when the occasyons be great / and yet he sayth that for all that he synneth not dedely. And thys is the thynge, for the profe wherof he bryngeth forth hys fore rehersed wordes of saynt Poule / by whyche he wolde make it seme, that saynt Poule dyd hym selfe so to.
                  And yet kepeth he hys accustumed guyse as farre as he can, in couerynge hym selfe and colourynge hys mater frō knowlege. And therfore he cometh in wyth synnynge and yet not synnyng. And for the redyng of that rydle, he sayth that the trew members of Crystes chyrch are synners and yet no synners. And amonge them he setteth hym selfe / sayenge of hym selfe and hys felowes, we be no synners yf thou  loke vppon the professyon of our hartes towarde the law of god, and on our repentaunce and sorowe that we haue synned and also bycause we be yet full of synne styll, and on to the promyses of mercy that is in our sauyo
                           •
                        r Cryst and vnto our fayth. And synners are we, yf thou loke to the frayltye of our fleshe by whiche we fall into horryble dedes, and the frute of synne whych remayneth in our membres breketh out.
                  
                  Here wolde I that Tyndale sholde somwhat more clerely tell vs what he meaneth in thys mater / whyther he meane that a trew mēber synneth not dedely all the whyle that he resysteth, and doth not the synfull horryble dede, as for ensample māslaughter or aduoutry. And that then agayne he synneth not, when that after the dede done he repenteth and is sory for hys euyll dede, and ys forgeuen of

                      god thorowe the promises of mercy in our sauiour Cryste, for the repentaunce & sorow & for the fayth. Let Tyndale I say tell vs whyther he mene thus / or ellys that hym self & hys other felowes the trew membres of chrystes chyrch do not synne dedely in the very tyme neyther, in whyche they consent to do those horrible synfull dedes, or rather in the tyme while they be in the doyng / for cōsent to the synne he sayth they neuer do.
                  By these wordes of hys we be no synners, yf thou loke to the professiō of our hartes to the law of god, & vnto our repentaūce & sorow that we haue synned / it may seme that he meneth the fyrst way, that is to wyt that they synne not all the while that they resiste the mocion to the dede, & that they synne not also, when that after the dede they take repentaunce  & sorow therfore.
                  Now yf he meane to rede hys rydle on thys fashyon / then he soyleth hys straunge rydle as bloutely, as an olde wyfe of Culnam dyd onys amonge scholers of Oxenforde, that sogerned wyth her for deth. whyche whyle they were on a tyme for theyr sporte purposynge rydles among theym, she bygā to put forth one of hers to / & sayed arede my ridle, what is that I knewe one that shott at an harte & kylled an haddoke. And when we had euery body mych mused how y• myght be, & thā prayed her to declare her ridle her selfe / after longe request she sayd at the laste, that there was onys a fyssher that came a londe in a place where he sawe an hart and shott thereat, but he hit it not / & afterwarde he went agayne to the see and caught an haddoke  and kylled it. And surely Tyndale redeth hys rydle myche lyke, yf he vnderstande by hys rydle they synne and y

                     t synne not. That they synne not whyle they resiste y• mocions, nor when they repent the dede / and that they synne whyle they be in doynge. For that is no more to say but in one tyme they synne, and in another they synne not. And when 
                        〈◊〉
                      synne then they synne / and whē they synne not than they synne not. were not here a wyse rydle wene ye & well declared, yf he mene it thus? And that he so meneth I saye it semeth by hys wordes afore rehersed / and also by these that he sayth, the spirit calleth vs home agayne. whereby it semeth that he meneth, we were onys gone from home and afterwarde be brought agayne.
                  Howe be it on the tother syde, he maye peraduēture mene

by these wordes, we be no synners yf thou loke to the profession  of our hartes towarde the lawe of god / that euyn styll in the very tyme in whyche they go aboute to brynge theyre horrible dedes to passe, and in whych they do theym to / yet professe they the lawe of god styl with theyre harte. And so may he seme to mene as well by other wordes in y• chapitres folowyng, as by these wordes in thys presente chapytre, where he sayth, we caste neuer of the yoke of god from our neckes, neyther yelde our selues vnto synne for to serue it, but fyghte a freshe and begynne a new batayle. By these wordes it semeth, and of trouth so I trow he fully meneth, as appereth by sundry other chapyters of this boke / & yet moste especyally by hys exposicyon vppon the fyrst pystle of saynt Iohn̄: y• though they synne in that they haue the mocions of synne, the reliques of oryginall synne remaynyng in the flesshe, yet bycause  they be borne of god by the ryghte faythe, that is as Tyndale expouneth yt, by the byliefe of the fayth confessed by saynt Peter, that Iesus is Chryste the son of god & our redemer / and bycause they haue that bylyefe, not only thorow the wordes of men preched vnto theym, whyche faythe is as he saythe hereafter but hystoricall, faynte, and sone goone / but haue yt grauē in theyr hartys by god (whych he calleth hereafter the felynge fayth) by whyche fayth he sayth that they fele theym selfe to byleue in god, & put theyr hole hope and truste of saluacyon in god, by the passyon of Chryste without any respecte of any good workes / & fele and be sure that god loueth theym, & that they be in hys fauour, & be trew chosen mēbres of his elect chyrch, and shall neuer be dampned / and by thys felyng faythe be  borne of god, & that therfore they haue the spyryt of god in theym, by reason wherof they can neuer synne dedely / for ye spyryt (sayth he) shall neuer suffer theym to synne of purpose, but all the horryble dedes that they shall do, shalbe onely of wekenes and frayletye of the flesshe vppon grete occasyons, when the frute of synne that remayneth in theyre mēbres breketh owte: for thys cause he sayth that though the mocyon of the fleshe towarde horryble dedes be synne, and therfore they synne / yet bycause of theyr felyng fayth, they kepe styll in theyre hartes theyre professyon towarde the lawe of god. And when they haue done the dedes & taken a fall / yet caste they neuer of the yoke of god of theyr nekkes / nor yelde them self vnto synne to serue it, but whē
                     
                      the rage is ones passed, then ryse vp lyke lusty galyardes agayn, & fyght a fresh, & cry a new feld a new, & begynne a new batayle / & then is (saith he) all forgiuē thē quyte, & they clene assoyled of god both from synne & payne / & no payne shall suffer any tyme after for the synne passed before, neyther in purgotory nor in thys worlde neyther. And therfore neyther in goynge about theyr horryble dedes, nor in the commyttyng of them / he sayth they neuer synne dedely nor neuer can, be the dede neuer so abomynable. And suche as farre lesse were dedely and dampnable in a nother man, that were not so borne of god by suche a felynge fayth as they be, nor hadde receyued the seed of god in hym as they haue / whyche seed ones had can neuer suffer them to synne of purpose, and therfore neuer dedely after.

And therfore let vs now cōsider how he may mayntayne his menyng, & what good frute wyll folow therupō, in y• felyng of such holy mēbres.
                  Syth Tyndale agreeth, that bothe Luther & hym selfe, and all other the trewe membres of the electe chyrche, may

do greate horryble dedes suche as he denyeth not to be in  other men dedely and dampnable: we must enserche with hym and aske of hym, what is the thynge that maketh the same horryble dedes whyche sholde be dedely in a nother, to be not dedely in Luther or hym, or any suche other trew membre of theyr electe chyrche.
                  He wyll peraduenture answere vs & say, it is no dedely synne in them, bycause that god doth afterward vpō theyr repentaūce & sorow taken for theyr synne, forgyue them the deth & all maner of payne dew to ye horryble dede by them before cōmitted / & that therfore it is not dedely to them, bycause by goddes remyssyon and pardō it is prouyded that they shall not dye. Thys answere of Tyndale is very slender / for it implyeth the cōtrary of yt it sholde proue. For it declareth yt the dede is dedely, & that he synneth dedely. For ellys god dyd not pardon hym the deth vppon hys repentaūce, yf deth were not dew to hys dede.
                  And I do not now lay to them the tyme before theyr cō
                     sent vnto the dede, nor the tyme of theyr repentaūce after theyr euyll dede / but the tyme in whych theyr wyll cōsen
                        •
                     ed and agreed to do it, & the tyme in which they dyd it in dede / in thys mene tyme say I they synne dedely in dede.
                  Nay sayth Tyndale, for afterwarde we repente, and by and by god forgyueth vs the deth, for hys mercy in our sauyour Chryst, and for our fayth, and for hys promyses.
                  Thys wyse answere is mych lyke, as though he wolde tell vs that one which had robbed a chyrche were a thefe & yet not a thefe. A thefe bycause he had stolē away ye chalyce, & yet not a thefe bycause ye kyng had gyuē hym a pardon.
                  
                  Tyndale wyll yet happely say, yt the thefe was not sure before yt he shold haue his pardō after / but Luther & he & such other trew mēbres of theyr electe chyrch, be sure by goddes ꝓmises, yt vpō theyr repētaūce they shall haue theyr pardō.
                  But then aske we hym agayne, though he knowe by the promyse that vpon repentaūce he shall haue pardon / how knoweth he and what promyse hath he, that when he hath commytted horryble dedes, he shall haue after the grace gyuen hym to take such repentaūce as ye pardō shall folow.
                  Hereto shall Tyndale saye that hym selfe & hys felowes do fele by theyr felyng fayth, that they be borne of god, and that they haue his seed within them / by whych they be well assured that they shall neuer do any such dede, as they shall

                      spyrytually dye for / but is very sure and feleth well by hys felyng fayth, yt the spyryt wyll call hym home agayn after, be he neuer so farre gone, and wyll cause hym to repente, & so gete hym hys pardon.
                  Of thys opyniō be they very surely / wherof ye se well foloweth no lytell occasyan of bolde settynge forwarde vnto synne. For yf a prynce wolde promyse euery man a perdon byfore hand, yt wold so surely truste vpon his promyse, as what so euer he shold do he wolde not let to come & aske it / no mā dowteth I suppose what plenty thys promyse wold make of all kynde of vnthryftes. But as for god, though he haue made a trew faythfull ꝓmyse of pardō, to all trew repētaūtes & penitētes what minde or purpose so euer they had byfore (the truth of which promyse Tyndale yet mystrusteth  in them ye synne willyngly & of purpose, & playnely sayth yt they shall neuer haue pardon) yet hath our lorde of his godnes & wysdome left one brydle boūde about mēnes heddes to refrayne them frō boldenes of synne, yt is to wyt yt they can not after theyr synfull dedes repente agayne of thē selfe without his specyall grace. which though he doth of his goodnes comēly offer / yet be they not put in surty byfore, yt it shalbe so offred vnto thē. But yt yf they so boldely make them self sure therof byfore, yt the corage therof gyue them occasyō to synne / it may be ye cause yt god shall clerely withdraw it frō them, & neuer offer it them after. And thys vncertaynty of grace to folow is ye brydle yt refrayneth our boldenes / where as Tyndale & his holy felowes the trewe mēbres of Crystes chyrch, feling by theyr feling fayth that  after theyr horrible dedes done, they shall vndowtedly take repētaūce & so gete theyr pardon / haue this brydle of drede cast of theyr hed, & therfore are redy lyke vnbrydled coltes to rūne out at rouers in all horrible dedes whyther so euer ye occasyōs of theyr wyld affeccyōs, & the synne as Tindale sayth brekyng out in theyr mēbres, lyst to cary theym. For whē they be caryed out vpō occasyōs by ye deuyll & ye flesh / then Tyndale calleth it but frayltye & infyrmyte, & no wyll in no wise nor no malycyous purpose. And therfore of this heresy, without which they can not defēde theyr other, ye se what good frute must folow. And yet suppose yt Tyndals false heresy were trew, & yt they were as certayn & sure of repētaūce, & therby of remissyō & pardon, as they say they be / this wold not yet mayntayne his mater. For though that a traytoure were so well acquaynted with the condycyon of

hys kynge, that he veryly knewe that when he hadde all  wrought that he coude in his traytorouse purpose agaynst hym, he sholde yet after obtayne his pardon, and therupon boldely so dyd, vpon some occasion and hope of some hygh promocyon, and afterwarde were not deceyued but obtayned hys pardon in dede: yet had he ben for all that a stark traytour in the meane whyle, and hadde dedely trespassed, though the deth folowed not, but the faute were fully forgyuen. And so mych the more traytorouse wretche, in how mych the prynce were of hys nature more benyng and marcyfull. And thus ye se playnely that Tyndale to proue his rydle trewe, that though he synne he synneth neuer dedeli / muste seke some better shyfte then thys.
                  Tyndale wyll saye that hys felowys & he do not synne dedely in the tyme of the doynge of suche horryble dedes, bycause as they say they do them not of purpose nor wyllyngly, nor do not cōsent vnto synne to serue it / but all the whyle that they go there aboute, and all the whyle also in whyche they be in doynge, they resyste it in theyr wylles, & haue styll in theyr hartes theyr professyon to the loue of the lawe, and be sory that they shall breke it / & fynally do breke it agaynst theyr wyll by greate occasyons gyuen, whyche cary them forth to the doynge of those horryble dedes, in a rage of the synne brekynge out of theyr membres. whyche horryble dedes after the rage ones passed, they repente all waye and forthwyth be clene forgyuen.
                  Is not here good reder a goodly defence and a godly? And vndowtedly thys is theyr very defence in defendynge them selfe from dedely synne, as Tyndals awne wordes  as well in thys chapyter as in other folowynge, do playne and clerely shew.
                  But now seeth euery good chrysten man well inowgh, that they be wyckedly occupyed,
                        Psalmo. 140.
                      in sekyng as holy Dauid saith, excuses for theyr synne. For there is no man doth any suche dede agaynste hys wyll / but all be it that he resyste ye mocyon of the deuyll and the flesh at the fyrste, & cleuynge to the contrary styrynge of god and hys good angell, repugneth and stryueth agaynste the synne and is peraduenture loth to be brought therto / whych doyng is very godd, and therby good folke fynally caste of and ouercome all those temptacions thorow the grace of god wurkyng with thē: yet suche as in conclusyon fall to the doynge of those

                      horryble dedes whyche they be tempted to, though they be not fully so euyll as other that resyste the deuyll nothynge at all, but rather runne on apace towarde hell them selfe, then tary tyll the deuyll come to cary them / yet do they vndowtedly thorow theyr owne defaute fall from the grace wyllyngly, that holpe them whyle they resysted. And as it were a cowarde that had fought a whyle, wolde sodaynly caste awaye bothe bukler and swerde, & fall downe at hys enemyes fete, and yelde hym selfe in to hys enemyes handes: so do these folke which cōmytte those horryble dedes, after a whyle resystynge, by whyche by goddes helpe they sholde haue had the victory yf they wolde haue perseuered in the fyght / they chaunge theyr mynde by ye faute of theyr owne fre wyll, thorow the delectacyon of the synfull dede,  and so consent vnto the same, and then seke them selfe the waye to come therto, and the deuyll helpeth them to fynde it / and so breke they wyllyngly goddes commaundement, and fulfyll the pleasure of the deuyll and the luste of the fleshe. whyche wylfull fallynge from god and hys grace, vnto the deuyll and the flesh / what god man dowteth to be dampnable dedely synne?
                  And therfore whan Tyndale telleth vs that Luther and he and suche other trewe membres of theyr chyrche, whā they commytte ony suche horryble dedes, do not cōmytte theym wyllyngly, bycause they do commytte theym vpon great occasyons, and be caryed awaye spyte of theyr tethe with the rage of the synne that breketh out of theyr membres: sauynge my charyte syr I beshrewe theyr knauysshe membres,  out of whiche theyr synne breketh forthe with suche a rage. Let theym cast on colde water with sorow, & quenche that rage.
                  For without the defawte of theyr owne fre wyll, all the deuyls in hell can neuer caste vpon theym suche an hete, that shalbe able to brynge theym into that vyolent inuyncyble rage, to compell theym vnwyllyngly to do suche horryble dedes. For god hathe promysed as in playne scrypture appereth, that he wyll neuer so suffre theym.

                      leste the greatnes of his hyghe reuelacyons myght haue set hym vp in an hygh

pryde, had thorow goddes great mercyfull goodnes the  angell of Sathan the prycke of the flesshe, gyuē vnto hym to bete hym, & that in suche wyse that he was fayne thryes to cry to god to take it away: our lord agayne shewed hym that it was not good for hym to lacke it so soone, nor to haue it so sodenly taken away from hym / but shewed hym that his grace was suffycyent. whose strengthe in mannes feblenes so worketh with the fre wyll of hym that purposeth to contynue good, that all the deuyls in hell shall neuer be able to put hym in suche a rage, that may cary hym towarde horryble dedes one here bredth forwarde agaynst his wyll. And thus ye se that Tyndale as towchynge his ryall rydle of synnynge and synnynge not, is now brought to that poynt that he can not rede his owne rydle hym self / excepte he wyll peraduenture saye that it is neuer dedely  synne though it be doone wyllyngly, but yf a man consent to the synne, and than wyll vnderstande therby, that he cō
                     senteth not to the synne that consenteth to the dede, but yf he consent that the dede shulde be synne / & so that he which agreeth to do auoutry doth not synne, bycause he doth not consent that aduoutry shulde be synne, but rather wolde it were none. Excepte Tyndale mene some suche farre fette wyse inuencyon / elles can I not in good faythe perceyue how he can helpe Luther and hym selfe and other holy heretyques the trewe membres of theyr electe chyrche, from consentynge to synne / whan they do as he confesseth horryble dedes vpon great occasyons thorow the rage of synne, buddyge and bryngynge forthe the fruyte that bredeth out of theyr vngracious membres.
                  
                  For yf he lake for any helpe of these wordes, where he sayth that they yelde not theym selues vnto syn for to serue it / as though other folke whan they do synne do entende to serue synne / but they for holynesse of theyr felynge faythe, in the doynge of theyr synnes do not entende to serue the synne, but to make the synne to serue theym and do theym pleasure at theyr owne luste and lykynge: let hym for answere loke how saynt Austayne mocketh in lyke case an olde fylosopher / whiche beynge asked why he was not ashamed to haue an harlot as other rybaudes had, answered for his defence that there was great dyfferēce bytwene his dede & theyrs. For as for theym they had not the harlot but the harlot had theym. But as for hym he had the harlot & not the harlot hym. And ther was by saynt Sym,

                      a propre reason and a trym. A fayre bost for a phylosofer to haue an harlot at his wyll, that lay with euery man bysyde at her wyll. Now Tyndale maketh here a lyke boste for to excuse hym and his felowes, sayenge, we fall whan the occasyons be great into horryble dedes, and the fruyte of the synne whiche remayneth in our membres breketh out, but yet we neuer yelde our selues vnto synne to serue it / menyng of lykelyhed that the synne shall serue thē, as the harlot dyd the folyshe phylosofer. But our sauyour hym selfe wypeth a way clene all the worshyp of Tyndales worde, whan he sayth playnly that who so euer do synne, is by the doynge bycome the bonde thrall of synne. And so by y• very trewe tale of Chryst, Tyndales false tale is auoyded. For whan so euer he yeldeth hym selfe to do horryble dedes, whiche he sayth they fall in vpon great occasyons,  whan the fruyte of the synne remaynynge in theyr myscheuous membres breketh out at large / than forthwith for all theyr felynge fayth, by theyr foule fleshly felynge in the doynge theyr fylthy deuelyshe dede, they yelde them selues to serue the synne, and by the synne to serue the deuyll / & the deuyll to serue them agayne, fyrste here for a lytell whyl
                        •
                      with a lytell fylthy pleasure, and after in hell for euer with blowynge the fyre aboute them.
                  For as towchyng Tyndales wordes folowynge, where he sayth they wyll ryse and fyght a freshe and begynne a new batayle: these wordes make nothynge to the purpose / for they were neuer able to ryse agayne alone. And yf god lyfte them vp as many tymes he dothe / yet were they not sure that he so wolde for he dothe not euer so to euery man.  And of which sorte hym selfe is, that can he neuer tell what so e
                        •
                     er he bable.
                  And also yf he dyd alway so, & that they were also sure byfore that he wold allway so do after / yet can it not serue Tyndale in this poynt. For we speke of the dedely synne in the tyme of his fall, and of the seruitude and thraldom that he lyeth in, all the whyle that he lyeth prostrate vnder the deuyls fote, and not that after that god hath goten hym vp agayne / and therfore those wordes wyll not helpe
                  How be it of trouthe Tyndales wordes wryten a lytell before, yf they were trewe as they be not, wolde make more for the profe of his purpose / where he saythe that thoughe they fall into horryble dedes, vpon great occasyons whan the 
                        •
                     rute of the synne remaynynge in theyr flesshe breketh

out of theyr membres, yet they neuer caste of the yoke of  god fro theyr neckes.
                  These wordes yf they were trewe, wolde make in dede somwhat for theyr purpose. For yf it so were that for all the doynge of theyr horryble dedes, they dyd neuer cast of the yoke of god fro theyr neckes: than myght it seme that in the tyme of the doynge they dyd not yet synne dedely, syth theyr neckes were yet styll bouden within the yoke of obedyence to the loue of god, & that they had not shaken that yoke of.
                  But of truthe those wordes are vntrew. For whan they do those horryble dedes, whiche god hathe vpon peyne of eternall dethe precysely forboden them / & whiche no temptacyon can cause them so to do agaynst theyr wyll, but that they myghte by goddes helpe leue yt vndone yf they  wolde, syth god neuer vseth to deny the helpe of his grace, tyll man leue of his holde by slouth or frowardnes of his owne fre wyll / therfore I say whan they do those horryble dedes thorough the frute of theyr synne brekynge out of theyr bestely membres, they do by the dysobeyng of his precepte, shake of the yoke of god for the whyle / as an euyll ta

                     ched horse shakes of somtyme the brydle & runneth out at large. And than agayne yf it happen that at goddes callynge on, they repent & do penaunce, & purpose to amende & be better, than is the yoke put on agayne / as an vnbrydled horse somtyme whan he is folowed standeth styll & stayeth at his mayster his whystelyng, and suffreth his brydle to be put on agayne.
                  Now yf Tyndale say styll, that bycause of his felynge  fayth, whiche whan he hathe ones goten he sayth he can neuer lese after, and that therfore he can neuer after do dedely synne, not euen whyle he is in the doynge of suche horryble dedes, as he consenteth that he may fall in thorow the frute of the synne that breketh out of his mēbres: I wolde aske hym yet ones agayne, what is y• thynge that after the rage passed h

                      greueth hym for the loue & reuerence that he bereth hym, and not for any fere of hell / whiche fere is but seruyle and bonde, and therfore not metely for suche holy folke as Luther is and hym selfe: I answere hym yf that he say tr

But whan they resorte vnto her and talke with her more and more, and all agaynste theyr wyll ye wote well / for the deuyll dryueth them thyther, and he must nedes go whom the deuyll dryueth: then all the way they go they say to god and them selfes, ywys though I go thyther with my fete, yet I wyll not agre to go thyther with myne harte lo. Nor I wold not come at her at all good lorde, sauynge that vpon the great occasyon that I had when I saw her ones / I then lyked her so well that I

But yet for all y• rage  I wyll not cast of thy yoke good lord, but I wyll cary thy yoke styll about my necke to bedde with her, & put it about her necke to, & yoke vs bothe to gether. And yet after all this lo, when all the rage is paste yt now haryeth me forth in an hete thorow the frute of synne, which remaynynge in my flesshe, breketh out of my members / then wyll I repent it good lorde & be sory therfore, and retourne agayne from her to the, or ellys brynge her yoked with me to.

And then thou most nedes good lorde forthwith at the fyrst worde, gyue me full remyssyon of synne & payne, & all by our holy father the popys leue, so that I shall neuer be punysshed therfore, neyther in hell, purgatory, nor ī this world neyther. And this good mynde good lorde wyll I kepe styll and neuer let it fall out of my  harte / so that all the whyle that I lye bassyng with Besse, & I am doynge y• horryble dede with my body / yet wyll I neuer agre therto wyth my harte.

For I thanke the good lorde the seed of thy spyryt that thorow my felyng fayth is in me, can neuer suffer my harte to consent to be seruaunte to any synne, how horryble synnys & how many so euer my membres  do.

But than wolde he fayne saue his worshyp with sayeng nay / & therfore he denyeth that we be agreed. For he sayth yt the thyng which I call the ryght fayth, is not the ryghte fayth. For though a man byleue

                     ayth he neuer so ryght, without any wronge opyniō in any artycle of the fayth / yet but yf he haue trewe trust & full vndowted hope in god, & cheryte therwith also, which sayth he must nedes ensew therupon, els hath he no ryghte fayth. And so Tyndale auoydeth me not with any prouynge, that abomynacyon and synne can not stande wyth the thynge that is in dede a ryghte fayth / but that

abomynable synne can not stande with the thynge whych  hym selfe calleth the ryght fayth / bycause it pleaseth not hym to call a ryght fayth, that bylyefe that is right inough and hath none artycle wronge therin for as farforth as perteyneth to the nature of onely fayth, but yf it be both fayth and hope and cheryte to / wherin amonge all lerned men that here vs bothe and se hys sotle shyfte, he wynneth so mych worshyp therby, that he maye surely be mych ashamed therof, as often as he thynketh therof.
                  But marke well good reder, that he cōmeth forth after and sayth, that hym selfe and suche other hys holy companyons the trewe membres of theyr electe chyrch, as haue y• ryght fayth and the felynge fayth to, that is to wytte after hys owne doctryne full fayth full hope and cheryte bothe, so surely that it can neuer fall from theym / maye yet for all  theyr ryght fayth fall into abomynable synfull dedes, vpō great occasyons brekyng out of the frute of the synne that remayneth in theyr synfull membres / and maye for a space perseuer in those horryble synfull dedes, and yet all that whyle theyr ryght fayth doth contynue, and theyr abomynable synfull dedes to gyder. And so by Tindale hym selfe all abomynacyon and synne maye stande to gyther wyth the ryght fayth, that is not onely wyth the ryght bylyefe alone as I affermed, but wyth the ryght bylyefe & wyth good hope & cheryte to as Tyndale sayth, whyche I say is playnely false. For surely the thynne sotelty therof my groce wytte can  in no wyse perceyue. And thus good chrysten reders for conclusyon, ye now clerely se to what folysshe conclusyon he hath brought hym selfe in conclusyon / and all thys chapyter of his with his royall rydle of synnynge and not synnynge, is royally ronne to ryghte nought.

As good obedyent chyldren, though they loue theyr faders commaundementes, yet breke them ofte by the reason of theyr weakenes. And as they can not yelde them selues bond vnto synne to serue it / euyn so they can not erre in any thynge that sholde be agaynste the promyses whiche are in Chryste. And in other thynges theyr errours be  not vnto dampnacyon, though they be neuer so greate, bycause they holde them not malycyously.

                     I Shall good chrysten readers make no longe worke aboute thys chapyter. For syth the hole somme therof is as ye se no thynge ellys in effecte, but that the trew membres of Tyndals electe chyrche, do oftē erre and yet neuer erre, euyn in lyke maner as they often or rather alwaye synne and yet neuer synne / whyche hys manyfolde folyshe heresyes in euer synnynge and neuer synnynge, I haue many maner wyse playnely refelled and confuted in the chapyter nexte before: I maye therfore & wyll

                     ake a great  dele the lesse laboure and busynesse in thys.
                  I wyll therfore but put you in remembraunce that all hys mater standeth onely in thys, that hys trewe membres of hys electe chyrche, after that they haue onys goten the trewe fayth that saynt Peter confessed / vnderstandyng the same in suche erronyous wyse as Luther and Tyndale teche them wyth many playne pestylent heresyes therin, as I haue before openly and clerely declared you / and when that they haue onys attayned that fayth, not wyth an hystorycall maner as a man maye beleue a story, but wyth a felyng fasshyon as the chyld byleueth that the fyre is hote, bycause he hath burned hys fynger, as Tyndale wyll tell you in a nother chapyter after / who so (sayth he) hath onys in suche a fasshyon attayned and goten that fayth / that is

to wytte who so euer is ones enfect with 
                        •
                     hose heresyes, in  such a fast felyng fashyon, can neuer after erre dāpnably. And why? For two causes sayth Tyndale. One bycause y• lyke as they can not synne of purpose, but of weykenesse & infyrmyte / so can he neuer erre in any thynge at all, yt shuld be agaynst the promyses that are in Chryste.
                  A nother cause is, bycause what other errour so euer such a trew faythfull electe mēber of his electe chyrch happen to falle into, so that it be not agaynst the promyses that are in Chryst, can not be dāpnable be it neuer so grete / all though the trueth that is contrary to that errour, be wryten sayth Tyndale euyn in the very gospell it selfe. And why can it be no dedely synne? bycause sayth Tindale that an elected men ber of his, can not holde it malycyously.
                  So that by this ye maye clerely se, that Tyndale affermeth  & techeth for a treuth, that in all other thinges bysyde the promyses / a trewe member of hys electe chyrche maye somtyme erre, but neuer malycyously / and that is to wytte neuer but of weykenesse and furmentye, as hym selfe hath often all redy declared. And therfore they can not in any suche thynge synne dedely nor dampnably, be the thynge neuer so greate, and also wryten in the very gospell as he sayth after to.
                  By thys also ye may clerely se, that concernyng the promyses that are in Chryst / he sayth that a trew member can not erre at all, neyther malycyously nor of fraylte. For syth he graunteth errour of infyrmyte in other thynges onely that towch not the promyses / ye may clerely perceyue that concernynge the promyses he holdeth that a trew mēber of  his electe chyrch can not erre at all in any maner of wyse, neyther of malyce, nor purpose, nor fraylte, nor weykenes, nor infyrimte. So yt as he putteth ī all other poyntes, onely malycyouse errour to be dedely synne & dāpnable / so putteth he concernyng the promyses, euery maner of errour to be dedely synne and dāpnable / be it of purpose and malice, or of infyrmyte, fraylte, or weykenes / and for that cause a trew member of his electe chyrche can neuer fall therin.
                  For yf he ment not thus, he wolde not so deuyde
                        •
                      these two kyndes of errour / one agaynst the promyses, and the other agaynst other thinges, as ye se hym do / but yf it were to teche vs that the tone were dedely synne and dāpnable euery waye, and the tother neuer dampnable, but yf it were

                      holden of malice / and that therfore the trew member of his electe chyrch maye erre in the tone kynde, so it be not malycyously, bycause that ellys it is not dampnable nor dedely synne. But in the tother concernyng the promyses, he can neuer erre at all. And why? but bycause that euery errour therin were dedely synne and dampnable / & that one of his heresyes is as ye haue herd byfore, that a trew member of the elected chyrche can neuer synne dedely. And thys ye se therfore is hys playne doctryne / whych what treuth it hath we shall nowe playnely shew you.
                  Let vs fyrst begynne with errours agaynst y• promyses in Chryst. And therin let Tyndale tell vs fyrste wherfore a trew mēber of his electe chyrch, can not erre in any thynge that is agaynst the promyses y• be in Chryst / in suche wyse  as they may in other great artycles of the fayth, that be no promyses. what hath he other to say, but bycause y• euery maner errour though it be not holden malycyously, is yet dedely synne & dāpnable, yf it towch any promyse / and that none other errour is dedely synne or dampnable, whyche towcheth no promyse, but yf it be holden malycyously.
                  Then must we forther aske hym, wherby he woteth and wherby he proueth, yt euery maner errour in euery artycle of any promyse yt is in Chryst, is dedely synne & dāpnable, though it come but of weykenes and fraylty / and none

                     rrour in any other artycle, be it neuer so great is dampnable & dedely, but yf it be holden of malyce.
                  we must aske hym wherby he knoweth y• it is inowg
                        •

For ye Chryst is one god equale with the father, it is no promise made vnto vs / nor yt the holy goste is so neyther / but it is a thyng by god tolde vnto vs. And I maruayle mych by what menys Tindale can proue vs, that there is any lesse parell in not byleuynge of goddes other wordes, then in the wordes of hys promyses / syth he byndeth vs to byleue them both a lyke.
                  The cause of our saluacyō is not the bylyefe of the promyse, nor the truste therin neyther, of any proper nature of that bylyefe in the promyse / no more then the nature of our good workes, is able of it selfe for our saluacyon / but the ordynaunce of god, that it pleaseth hym to saue vs for

our obedyence of hys commaundement bothe in the bylyefe  and the worke. For as he coulde yf it so pleased hym, brynge vs all vnto the blysse of heuen wythout any good worke at all / so coulde he yf he lyste, brynge vs all thyther wythout any fayth at all. For he coulde brynge vs thyther wythout any knowledge gyuen vs therof, tyll we came thyther and had it. So it appereth clerely, that the cause of the saluacyon standeth all in the obedyence of goddes cō
                     maundement / wherby he byddeth vs, and by hys byddyng byndeth vs, to captyue our vnderstandynge in to the obedyence of fayth and byleue hys promyses.
                  Now yf thys be thus as of trouth it is / what dowte is there but that we be as vpon lyke rewarde, so vpon lyke parell & payne, bounden to byleue all other thynges yt god telleth vs, as well as the thynges whych he promyseth vs.
                  
                  And therfore yf Tyndale wyll to the contrary loke to be byleued of any man in thys poynt / he muste accordynge to hys owne rule
                        •
                      brynge forth playne and open scrypture, by whyche god hath tolde vs by wrytynge, that yf we byleue onys hys promyses, care for no more. For as for all other thynges that be no promyses, he wyll that we be at lyberty to byleue as we lyste / so that there be no malyce in vs. And why at more lybertye of byleuynge god in hys other wordes, then in hys promyses? I can not perceyue what cause Tyndale can imagyne / but yf he be so madde to thynke, that god wyll in all hys other tales that hym lyste to tell vs, though they be wryten in the very gospell as Tyndale sayth after, haue vs yet at lybertye in beleuynge hym, bycause hym selfe wolde be at lybertye to tell vs for hys pleasure  somtyme trew talys, and somtyme suche as Tyndale telleth, that is to wytte vntrewth and lyes.
                  Surely this is a maruelouse tale of Tyndale in my mynde / & a maruelouse dyfference that he putteth bytwene the bylyefe of the promyses and the bylyefe of all the other artycles of the fayth. As though the bylyefe of the promyses onely, were so farre aboue the bylyefe of any other artycle / when euery man that any wytte hath, maye well and clerely se, that the bylyefe of the promyses do so depende vpon some other artycles, that the bylyefe of those artycles gone, the bylyefe of the promyses and all to gyther were gone. As who so were (as many haue ben) so madde to byleue that there were no god at all / wyth hym were goddes

                      promyses quyte gone. And hys synne were as greate that erred in not byleuynge there were any god, as hys that byleuynge there were a god, erred yet in that he byleued not that euer he made any promyse to man. And yet in goddes promyses Tyndale meneth onely y• promyses of god made vnto mankynde / for so farre go saynt Peters wordes,
                        Matth. 16.
                      
                     qui in hunc mundum venisti, is Tyndals exposycyon to. And therfore as for Tyndale, ye se well so that he byleue that hys electe chyrche of mankynde shalbe saued / he maye wythout any parell chese whyther he wyll byleue that euer any angell is eternally saued or not / notwythstandyng that Chryst sayd of saynt Iohn̄ the baptyst, that the lest in heuen was greter then he.
                        Lucae. 7.
                      yet bycause it was but a tale tolde by the mouth of Chryst, and not a promyse made / & specyally syth it was  no promyse of any gyfte gyuen to man: Tyndale maye dystruste it and denye it yf he lyste, yf hys wytte haue any such wekenes, and so that he do it not of malice / for all that it is playnely wryten in the very gospell, and there tolde by goddes owne mouth.
                  Concernynge yet the promyses made to man / let vs cō
                     syder whych thynges be promyses, and whych thynges be not the very promyses, but other artycles besyde. That we shalbe saued thorow Chryst and by Chrystes passyon, is a promyse. And yet that Chryst hym selfe was the same very person, by whom that dede shold be done, is more properly a tale then a promyse. And it maye be that a man byleuyng the promyse that mankynde shall be saued thorow Chryst, may yet erre in not byleuynge y• Iesus the sonne of Mary  was that Chryste. And of trouth eyther in that errour or very nere to that errour, be all the hole secte of Iewes. So that it is as great parell not to byleue god in hys tale, whē he sayed thys is my welbeloued sonne in whom I myche delyte / as not to byleue hym in hys promyse made vnto Habraam,
                        Matth. 17.

                      For it is not all one to promyse that of hym sholde one come by whom the worlde sholde be saued, and to tell hym thys is the man that in my promyse I spake of. For a promise and a tale be not both one thynge. For though euery promyse by in dede a tale, syth no man can make a promyse but yf he tell it: yet is not euery tale a promyse, as euery chylde perceyueth. And therfore saynte Peter toke a sure waye, when he sayed, Thou arte Chryst that arte come into thys

worlde / takyng it for a pryncypall poynt to byleue goddes  tale. For the tale that thys was he whyc

                      as our sauyour sayde, the father in heuen had hym selfe tolde vnto Peter, that tale Peter confessed, that Iesus was Chryste whyche was then comen into the worlde. But the promyse whyche was the sauynge of the worlde that sholde be wrought in hym / that thyng saynt Peter spake not of there, as a thyng byleued and loked for afore / nor of the mene of the sauyng that it shulde be by hys passyon, that thynge saynte Peter as Tyndale sayth at that tyme knewe not of / so that ye tale and the promyse were not all one.
                  But surely cōcernyng the bylyefe of goddys promyses / Tyndale semeth to fare as the Iewes do. For lyke as many of them byleue, that thorow Chryste the world shall be saued / and yet they lese the frute of that bylyefe, bycause  they wyll not knowe who is Chryste: euyn so Tyndale sayth,
                        Matth. 28.
                      that he byleueth Chrystes promyse made vnto hys chyrche here in erth, that hys holy spyryte shalbe therwith vnto the worldes ende, and teche it and lede it into euery trouth.
                        Iohā. 16.

                  And also where as Chryst when he turned the brede into his own precyouse body, & the wyne into his blessed blode, & cōmaūded the same to be done for euer in his chyrch after in remēbraūce of his passyō,
                        Lucae. 22.
                      & dyd in so cōmaūdyng make a faythfull promyse, yt hym selfe wolde be for euer with hys chyrch in that holy sacramēt / & for a perpetuall memory of hys bytter passyon that he suffered for vs, wolde gyue hys owne flessh

                      accordynge to hys owne wordes spoken vnto hys chyrche, when he sayed,
                        Matth. 28.
                      I am with you all dayes vnto the ende of the worlde: Tyndale wyll not now byleue that promyse at all / but as I haue in my fyrst boke by hys owne wordes proued you, maketh mockes and mowes at that blessed sacrament, and calleth it but cake brede, and reasoneth it rather for starche full lyke a starke heretyke god wote, and sayth it is neyther body nor bloude at all.
                  And thus where he so hyghly magnifyeth the bylyefe of goddes promyses onely, settynge all other artycles of the fayth as thynges of a seconde sorte / hym selfe byleueth as ye se the promyses as lytell as the tother.
                  But now let vs go ferther in hys wordes, & se for what cause he sayth, that none other errour in any thynge saue  the promyses can be dampnable, be they neuer so greate. Lo thus he sayth,
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     In other thynges that be not the promyses, theyr errours be not vnto dampnacyon, though they be neuer so greate, byca

                        se they holde them not malycyously. As now, yf some when they rede in the new testament of Chrystes bretherne, wolde thynke that they were our ladyes chyldren after the byrth of Chryst, bycause they knowe not the vse of the spekynge of the scrypture / or of the Hebrues how that nygh kynnesmen be called bretherne, or happely they myghte be Iosephes chyldren by some fyrste wyfe, neyther can haue any to teache hym for Tyranny that is so greate / yet coude it not hurte hym thowgh he dyed therin, bycause it hurteth not the redempcyon that is in Chrystes blood. For though she had none but Chryst / I am therfore neuer the more saued, neyther yet the lesse though she had had. And in suche lyke an  hundred that plucke not a mans fayth from Chryste, they myghte erre and yet be neuer the lesse saued / no though the cōtrary were wrytē in the gospell. For as in other synnes, as soone as they be rebuked they repent / euen so here as soone as they were better tawght, they sholde immedyately knowledge theyr errour and not resyste.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Here haue ye good reders the reason and ye cause, wherfore the trew membres of Tyndals chyrch can neuer synne dedely, though they erre in any artycle that is no promyse, be the article neuer so great. The cause is sayth he, bycause that lyke wyse as in all other synnes as soone as they be rebuked they repente / euyn so as soone as they be better taught, they repēt theyr errour, and byleue the trouth, and resyste not / and for that cause it is no dedely synne in the

mene season, before they be rebuked and taught better, all  though they dyed in those errours, were the artycles neuer so great, and the contrary trouth wryten in the gospell, so that they be none of the promyses.
                  Thys is the hole somme and effecte of thys hole chapyter, though he tryfle with other thynges bytwene. And therfore wyll we fyrste aske hym by what scrypture or by what reason, he proueth that euery person whych is elected to be saued, shall repent as soone as euer he is rebuked of any synne that he doth.
                  He wyll shew peraduenture, that Dauid dyd so, & happely some other to. That wyll be a very bare argumente. Dauid was an electe person / and he dyd so, ergo euery elected person doth so? Thys argument wyll be very lyke the forme of arguynge, that yonge chyldren vse in grammer  scholes.

And theyr vntrewe doctryne maye be so depe entred and roted in the good symple soule, that when he is by better men better taught, he shall not repent hys errours at the fyrste nor at the seconde tyme neyther, but defende them many a tyme &  ofte / and yet shall at length wyth helpe of goddes grace, applye hys wyll rather indyfferētly to perceyue the treuth, then frowardly to stycke styll in heresye / & so shall fall in to ye ryght way agayn, and very clerely se that those blynde heretykes had ledde hym in darkenes before.

Now saye I then to Tyndale, that hys hope of the mannes chaunge to hys secte, eyther bycause hym selfe shall in the laborynge of hym to drawe hym to it, playe the deuyls parte, and thynke that though an electe shall turne from euyll to good alway at the fyrste mocyon, and that therfore yf he turne not at the fyrste it is  in vayn to go any more about hym / yet a reprobate though he turne not from hys present good state vnto synne at the fyrste, shall turne after well inough / and therfore he wyll laboure hym styll to his secte.

For yf it were in any of the promyses, that Tyndale shold fynd a man after baptisme byleue as ye chyrch byleueth, agaynst the heresyes that he byleueth / that is to wytte byleuynge agaynste Tyndale, that goddes promyse of saluacyon in the blode of Chryste, doth not quyte put awaye shryfte and all penytencyall workes towarde satysfaccyon, and all punysshement for any synne repented, to be sustayned eyther  in thys worlde or purgatory / but that so to byleue & truste in goddes promyse, is a dampnable erroure agaynste goddes promyse: yf Tindale I say fynde such a man, he shold by hys owne tale here perceyue that man forthwith for a desperate heretyke / bycause that yf hym selfe saye trewe, that none electe person can after hys baptysme euer fall in to any errour concernynge any of the promyses, then shold hym selfe knowe that he whom he founde in that errour cō

                  Consyder good reder, how many thynges here falle vppon Tyndals hedde at onys, by hys owne fond handelyng of thys ensample.
                  Fyrste it is foly for hym to put, that for tyranny nowe any man sholde lacke techynge, that those chyldren were not borne of our ladyes body / syth that artycle is as well & comenly knowen as any of y• promyses / and as longe hath  ben knowen, and as fully, and as comenly byleued thorow Chrystendome, as any other artycle of the chrysten fayth. And none artycle is there almost in the chrystē fayth which hath not had mo heretykes agaynste it, then this artycle of our ladyes perpetuall vyrginyte / so that it is now so well knowen, and that solucyon also of nygh kyn
                        •
                     ed called bretherne amonge the Hebrews, that Tyndale neuer neded to cumber hys boke therwith.
                  Bysydes this, hym selfe & his owne doctryne destroyeth hys owne solucyon. For he sayth that we be bounden to byleue none artycle, but yf it be proued by playne scrypture. Now though he teche now the trew members of hys electe chyrche, the thynge that euery chylde can tell all redy, that

                      amonge the Hebreus the nere kynnesmen were called bretherne: what hath he taught thē therby? any other thinge, then that the scrypture doth not proue, yt our lady had euer any mo chyldren then Chryst. He doth not yet by the scrypture teche his trew membres, to perceyue yt she had no mo, but onely that the scrypture sayth not playne the contrary. But then doth he by hys owne rule bysyde, teche them that they maye byleue at theyr lybertye yf they lyst, that she had mo chyldren in dede. And ferthermore he techeth them, that they shold in no wyse take it for any sure article of theyr by lyefe, that she was a perpetuall vyrgyn, and neuer had mo chyldren after Chryst. Thys poynt he techeth playnely after his maister Luther, as ye haue herd all redy thorow out his hole tytle, wherin he laboreth to proue that ye apostles  haue lefte nothyng vnwryten, the bylyefe wherof were necessary to saluacyō. whych false assercyon of his I haue in dyuers places of my formar bokes clerely cōfuted / & in the ende of my thyrd boke haue answered and auoyded all his hole chapyter therof. But now syth in thys present place, Tyndale hym selfe graunteth, that the cause why an electe person shall be saued, though he happen to erre & thynke yt our lady was not a perpetuall vyrgyn, is bycause that he shall repente that errour when he is taughte the contrary: playne it is to any man, yt hym selfe therin cōfesseth now, yt it is a necessary artycle for saluacyon, that to euery man at the leste wyse to whom it is opened & taught / syth the cause of his saluacyon whyche before byleued the contrary, is by Tyndale hym selfe the repentyng of hys formar errour.
                  
                      Now then it is so that Tyndale doth in sundry places, confesse & agre that thys poynt can not be proued by playn and euydente scrypture. Ergo he confesseth here playnely, the cōtrary of that he so fastely before hath affermed, whyle he taught that there is no thyng to be byleued for a suerty, but yf it be proued by playne and euydent scrypture / and that the apostles haue lefte no thynge vnwryten, whyche men are bounden to byleue vppon payne of dampnacyon.
                  Thys doctryne of hys mayster and his owne hath he as ye now se by hys owne handelyng of this mater, here vtterly destroyed and dampned.
                  Now yf he wyll happely for shame, laboure to seke some shyfte, and saye that he meaneth no more but to put thys dyfference bytwene the artycles of the fayth in the promyses,

and all other artycles, that none errour in any of the  other is dampnable, tyll the man that mysse byleueth be better taughte the trouth / and that then he is bounden to byleue them, whyther they be in scrypture or not / but in the bylyefe of the promyses, euery errour and ignoraunce also is dampnable ere euer they be taught. For no man shalbe saued but yf he be taught them and haue the faythfull bylyefe of them: thus muste Tyndale nedys saye for aught that I can se / or ellys muste he cōfesse, that one pece of his doctryne playnely destroyeth a nother, cōcernyng his dyfference bytwene the promyses and other artycles.
                  But yet abedeth styll agaynste hym, that syth he confesseth the perpetuall vyrginyte of our lady, to be now that it is taught necessary to be byleued, whiche is not wryten in scrypture: styll I say standeth it styffely agaynst hym, that  he hath destroyed all his pryncypall grounde, where about his mayster & hym self haue taken so great labour to make men wene that nothyng was necessaryly to be byleued, but yf it were euydentely wryten in holy scrypture.
                  But now concernynge his dyfference, bytwene the necessyte of the bylyefe of the promyses, and the bylyefe of the other artycles / we shall tell hym y• it wylbe peraduenture hard for hym to proue his sayenge trew, specyally takyng the promyses as hym selfe taketh them.
                  For in the begynnyng vpon the fyrst prechyng of saynt Peter,

                      when there were so many so sodaynly chrystened therupon / wherby can Tyndale proue yt all they were fully taught y• fayth of the promyses before they were baptysed, or that none dyed ere euer they were taught any ferther / or  that yf they dyed forthwith vpon theyr baptysme, that then theyr chrystēdome stode theym not in stede for lacke of ferther instruccyō of the promyses. Concernyng which I dare be bolde to say, that they were neuer taught the doctryne y• Tyndale calleth so necessary, y• he techeth the lacke of that fayth in the promise to be dampnable. For they were I say neuer taught, y• they must byleue that y• promyse shold saue them & gete thē of all theyr synnes at any tyme after theyr baptysme cōmytted, at theyr bare repentaūce, alway full remyssyō of synne & payn, & all in purgatory or in this world eyther, and without any regarde of any good wurke at all, or of any purpose therof, other then bare repentaunce and fayth in the promyses. I dare well saye they dyed all that

                      baptysed, ere euer they herde any thynge of this poynt 
                        •
                     f fayth in the promyses / whych was neuer thought vpon by saynt Peter nor any of hys felowes then, nor yet no man elles, tyll it was deuysed by the deuyll, & put forth by heretykes whē cheryte waxed cold many a wynter after.
                  If Tyndale make vs many questyons of them y• were so sodaynly chrystened so many at onys in the begynnyng: we wyll yet be bolde to tell hym y• many chyldren dye now soone after yt they come from chrystenyng, ere euer they be weshed out of y• chrysome / of which I suppose yt some were neuer taught fully the fayth of the promyses ere they dyed.
                  If he say to thys that though they were not taughte it actually, yet by the gyfte of god in the sacrament, it is taught and infunded into theyr soules habytually: then  wyll we aske hym wherby he proueth then hys dyfference, bytwen the fayth of the promyses and of the other articles / but yf he proue vs that onely the fayth of the promyses is infused, and of the other artycles not. whych when he proueth you, byleue hym / and in the meane whyle, byleue that hys euasyon is not worth a fly.
                  If he wyll say that the chyldren baptysed, and so forthwyth departynge, haue no fayth at all / but be saued onely by the fayth of theyr frendes, and by that our lorde hath receyued them to the sacrament of baptysme, and by the sacrament of baptysme hath receyued them to grace & glory, without any fayth of theyr owne: then gyueth he to the sacrament agaynste all hys other doctryne, a great effycacite of grace, and maketh it not onely a sygne. And yet graunteth  he then bysyde, the thynge that he denyeth / that is to wytte that some maye be saued beynge ignoraūt, not onely of some of the promyses, but also of them all.
                  Besydes thys, yf we wolde graunte hym the thynge that he can neuer proue: yet were he neuer the nere. For though it were trewe that wythout bylyefe of all the promyses, no man myghte be saued / but that the bare ignoraunce of any of them were dampnable, and that the ignoraunce of any other artycle were not dampnable, nor the contrary bylyefe tyll they were opened and taughte: yet syth men were (as Tyndale hath here confessed) bounden vpon payne of dampnacyon to byleue the perpetuall v

                      errour to the contrary as soone as they be taughte it, notwythstandyng

that it can not be proued by playne and euydent scrypture: then muste Tyndale graunte that it is lyke wyse of euery other lyke artycle, that is to saye of euery artycle, whych is trewe and muste be byleued when it is taught bysyde the promyses, though it can not be proued by scrypture, no more then the artycle of y• perpetuall vyrginite of our lady.
                  Then aske we Tindale how knoweth he those artycles whych be necessary artycles of the fayth, of which artycles the contrary bylyefe were dampnable after the trouth of those artycles taught, the same artycles not beynge wrytē in scrypture. Doth Tyndale knowe them by any other meane, then by the chyrche / syth they be not taught hym by scrypture? For it were harde that he sholde in such a mater byleue y• authoryte of any one man, but yf that eyther god byd hym byleue hym, or that for lacke of scripture he proue  the trouth of hys doctryne by myracle, or by myracle proue hym selfe to be appoynted by god to teche hym / by reason wherof he myghte be

                  Therfore conclude I, that Tyndale must nedes graūt, that he knoweth not those articles but by the chyrch.

                  Of thys chyrch therfore must Tyndale lerne those artycles, or els can not be bounden to byleue them, & to repente hys forma

                      errours to the contrary, but yf he say that hym selfe haue them by specyall reuelacyon of god, pryuately shewed vnto hym selfe. And then yf he saye so, he muste eyther byleue them alone / or elles yf he wyll be byleued in them / & haue other men byleue them with hym / then muste he proue vs them by scrypture or myracle. And syth I dare answere for hym, that in suche artycles he lacketh those two / there is no remedy for hym but he must nedes confesse that he is taughte the suerty of those artycles, and lerneth whyche they be, onely by the chyrche of Chryste.
                  Then aske we Tyndale forther, whyche is that chyrche of Chryste, by whyche he is taught to know those necessary

                      artycles from all other / the bylyefe wherof is not necessary to saluacyon. He can not saye that he lerned it of any vnknowen chyrche, for no suche company can he knowe for the chyrche / but he muste nedes confesse that he lerneth to knowe those artycles by the knowen chyrche. And then by whych knowen chyrche? let hym name any whych he wyll, excepte the knowen catholyke chyrch whyche hym selfe impugneth / and he shall name a company of no credence in that poynt.

                  Now yf he wene to escape out so / he shall be soone set in. For then at the leste wyse he knowledgeth, that there are no good men out of thys chyrch / nor no man hath any trew sure fayth but it be lerned of thys chyrche, or of some membres of the same. And then syth hym selfe and hys felowes be out of thys chyrche / both wylfully fyrst departed out, & after worthly cast out: them selfe be none of them of whom the trouth can be lerned. Also to say yt he therin byleueth

onely the good men of the knowē chyrche / that thyng hath  hym self made impossyble to serue hym / for they be by hym the onely electes, whych may by hys own doctryne though they can do no dedely synne, do horryble dedes yet, and so seme very nought. And in thys comon knowen chyrch, the comon knowen fayth or bylyefe is all one, bothe wyth the good and the badde, though the lyuynge be dyuerse. If Tyndale dare denye that / lette hym loke in the workes of saynt Austayne, saynt Hierom, saynt Cypryane, saynt Ambrose, saynt Basyle, saynt Gregorye, saynt Chrysostome, & all the other olde holy doctours and sayntes, of euery tyme thys fyftene hundred yere / and he shall not for very shame saye nay, but that agaynste Luther & hym those holy sayntes had the same fayth that ye comon catholyke lay people haue yet vnto thys daye / as for ensample, that it is an horryble  abomynacyon, that any monke or frere sholde wedde a nonne. wherin yf Tyndale dare say that I lye / let Tyndale as I haue often sayd, brynge forth of all the olde holy sayntes, some one that sayde the contrary / whyche I am very sure he can not. So that fynally, Tyndale is comen agayn to the same poynt, that he must in fayth and bylyefe of such artycles, byleue the comon consent of the hole chyrche / and not take hys doctryne of any one man or any few, that wolde in fayth vary, swarue, and fall from the comon fayth of the hole catholyke chyrche / not though there fell awaye parcell mele, so many that they lefte the chyrche for the fewer parte.
                  For god shall for the knowledge of hys trewe chyrche euer more amonge many other thynges, specyally prouyde  twayne. One, that they whyche departe out therof shall neuer agre to gether in one bylyefe. Another, that y• lyghte of myracles shall neuer shyne amonge any of theyr chyrches, but onely in hys olde trewe catholyke chyrche remaynynge. And therin shall they styll contynue, wythout any wonders wroughte in any of the false coūterfeted chyrches of heretykes, vntyll that Antychryste shall come hym selfe / whyche as helpe me god I very greately fere is now very nere at hande. But when he is ones comen / our lorde be thanked he shall not very longe endure, ere Chryste shall hym selfe wyth the blaste of hys blessed mouth, blowe that prowde beste to noughte.

                  And thus good chrysten reders for the fynall conclusyō of thys chapyter / here ye maye playnely se, that I myghte well yf I wolde wyth thys same chapyter make an ende of

all the hole mater. For ye well remēber that all our mater  in this boke, is bytwene Tyndale and me no thynge ellys in effecte but to fynde out whyche chyrche is the very chyrche. For syth he seeth hym selfe playnely bounden to gyue credence to that chyrche whych so euer be it / he therfore in all hys boke bryngeth it in to darkenes, & laboreth to make it vnknowē / bycause he wold not by the knowlege therof, haue hys heresyes knowen and reproued.
                  And now ye se that as our lady wolde, by hys folysshe handelynge of the artycle of her perpetuall vyrgynyte, he is quyte ouerthrowen / and hath it playnely proued vnto hym vpon hys owne wordes, that the very chyrche is none other, but thys that he denyeth / that is to wytte the comon knowen catholyke people, clergy, lay folke, and all / whych what so euer theyr lyuynge be (amonge whom vndowtedly  there ar

                  And therfore as I say, sauynge that I wyll go ferther to shew you som what of hys ferther foly / ellys myghte I well euyn here bothe ende thys present chapyter, and also thys hole worke / wherin with a few of hys owne wyse wordes, Tyndale hath confounded hym selfe, and stroyed all hys hole mater.
                  For as towchyng hys accustumable raylynge in y• ende  of hys chapyter, wyth whyche he wolde seme to touche the catholyke chyrche / it is all so clene agaynste hym selfe, and so clerely describeth and depeynteth hym selfe and his own felowes, that yf we wolde laboure sore to fynde oute what euyll we myght say by thē we coulde fynde no better thyng to put vs in remembraūce of euery poynt of theyr myscheuouse maters, than Tyndals owne wordes that he wryteth here hym selfe. Lo thus he sayth.
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     But they whyche malicyously mayntayne opynyons agaynste the scrypture, Here shold he say as for ensample they that mayntayne that frerys maye wedde nonnes.
                  
                     or that that can not be proued byscrypture, One of these thynges is

                      as ye haue herd, y• perpetuall vyrginite of our lady, which hym selfe hath cōfessed in this same chapyter, that the trew membres of his electe chyrch, must nedes byleue after that they be ones taught it. And then yf them selfe be bounden to byleue it, they be bounden to stande therby & mayntayne it. And so speketh Tyndale clere agaynst hym selfe.
                  
                     or suche as maketh no mater vnto the scripture, He meneth such thynges as were not of necessyte requysyte to be wrytē in scrypture / and therfore he wryteth lyke hym selfe. For there is not one article of the fayth y• of necessyte neded to be wrytē, but that god coulde both haue taught them & kepte them without wrytyng. As he hath taughte & kepte some / as for ensample y• ꝑpetuall virginite of our lady, which Tyndale hath both denyed, & confessed, & denyed agayne, & woteth  neuer where to hold him / y• deuyl so troubleth his braynes. and to saluacyon that is in Chryste, whyther they be trew or no / The chyrche hath none suche as make no mater to saluacyon. For euery thyng that god wyll haue byleued pertayneth to saluacyon / syth the contrary bylyefe is dysobedyence to god that so taughte it hys chyrch, bycause he wolde haue it byleued. And y• the perpetuall virginite of our lady is of such sorte, Tyndale hath hym selfe openly & playnely agreed / & yet wold he now secretely stele backe agayn. Not wyttyngly peraduenture, but yt the deuyl pulleth hym backe by his cote skyrte vnware.
                  
                     and for the blynd zele of them make sectes, brekyng the vnyte of Chrystes chyrche, for whose sake they oughte to suffer all thynges / and rese agaynste theyr neyghbours (whom they

And where he speketh of kyllyng and sleyng theyr bretherne / hym selfe can tell well inough y• good chrysten prynces & other vertuouse people, dyd in ye begynnynge gretely  forbere such heretykes / tyll y• they were fynally fayne in auoydyng of theyr sedicyous trouble, & for the repressyng of theyr inemendable malice,

But as Tyndale knoweth that this is trew / so knoweth he well agayn that the heretykes haue ben those, y• dyd in chrystendom begyn to fyght, kyll, and sle, before y• thē selfe were kylled & slayne, or any thyng  foughten withall / and yt they began to be kylled & foughtē withall, by theyr owne importune malice, wherby y• catholyke people were constrayned and cōpelled to kyll them in the necessary defence of innocentes. And y• this is trew / Tindale knoweth very well, both by the storyes as well of England as of other places, and also by ye experyēce of his own dayes in Almayn, thorow the cruell insurreccyō there of his owne felowes the heretykes of his own secte. which rose there, and robbed, burned, and killed, not one noughty knaue or two in a towne as good kynges and prynces do these horryble and incorigible heretykes, and yet somtyme s

And then they fell vpō the heretykes agayn, & kylled of thē aboue .iii. score thousand in dyuers places all in one somer. Synnes which tyme in Swycherlande euyn thys laste yere zuinglius set his heretykes in a rage agayne, to pyll & spoyle the trew catholykes of his owne countre. But  god gaue the victory to his faythfull folke, that were full loth to fyghte wyth them, sauyng y• very force draue them to the felde, where they bare ouer theyr enmyes. And zuinglius hym selfe tharcheretyke of all / was there dedely woū
                     ded & taken, & after y• burned vp. Such fayre fortune had Tindals master there, of whō he toke his heresies agaynst the blessed sacramēt. And therfore, where Tyndale speketh of kyllynge of heretykes whom he calleth his crysten bretherne / he knoweth it well hym selfe yt his owne vnhappy felowes the heretykes I say them self, began fyrst y• guyse. And as they begā it euē so they kepe it styl. And surely there is no dowte but that Tyndale hym selfe hath longed long, & yet euer loketh for, yt as the Lutheranys & zuinglianys haue begon to ryse & ruffle in rebellyon in sondry partes of  Almayne / so he myght se his disciples assay some fete here. But I trust ī goddes grace & in the kinges goodnes, theyr hartes shall all faynt ere they come therto. And yf ye deuyll were so stronge with thē as to styre them vp / I wold wyshe Tindale among them & frere Barns to. For I lytell dowte yf they dyd, but both captayns & cōpany (as zuinglius and his bushment came shortely to myschyefe) yf god syt where he sat, sholde haue lyke lucke.
                  
                     Now is this a playn cōclusyō, that bothe they that trust in theyr owne workes, Lo what a parell here were, yf a frere sholde put any truste in chastyte & kepynge of his vow. But & yf he trust in lechery with weddyng of a nonne, then is he saufe inough / bycause that wurke is not hys owne wurke but the wurke of the deuyll, and of the synne that breketh out of his mēbres.

                     And they also that put truste in theyr owne opinyons / be falle

And therfore yf it be trew as in dede it is, that the whych truste in theyr owne wurkes, and make idols of theyr owne opynyons, and breke the vnyon of the chyrche, and make sondry sectes, and kyll theyr chrysten bretherne, be fallen from Chryst & from the waye of fayth that is in Christes blode / and therfore are none of Christes  chyrche, bycause they be not buylt vpon the rocke of fayth: then must it nedes folow, that Luther, Lambert, zuinglius Huskyn, and Tyndale, and all other of theyr sondry sectes, be fallen from Chryste and are from the waye of fayth that is in Chrystes blode / and therfore are none of Christes chyrche, bycause they put trust in theyr owne vayne inuencyons, and make idols of theyr owne fals opynyons.

And do put also theyr truste in theyr owne workes, not in fastyng, prayeng, almoyse, or any good wurke / but in destruccyon of monasteryes, castynge oute of relygyon, expulsyon of chastyte, wyth weddynge of nonnes and lyuyng in lechery, prophanyng of chyrches, pollutyng of aulters, blasphemynge of sayntes, rasshyng downe theyr images, castynge out theyr relykes, dyspyghtynge our lady, de

                      Now where that in all the synnys that he reherseth, he sayth that our fayth peryssheth not vtterly, nor our loue & consent vnto the lawe of god / but that they be weke, syke, and wounded, and not clene dede: I say that his tale is to lytell purpose. For yf by fayth he mene the belyefe / then is it not of nece

                  And yet maye he be an electe person and fall from the trewe fayth, that is to saye the trew bylyefe, and lese it vtterly byleuynge lyes and heresyes / and fall from grace for the tyme, and yet after that wyth helpe of gra

                  And yf Tyndale here by the name of fayth, vnderstande hope and truste in god, as he iugleth cōtynually with that worde / for suche equyuocacyons and dyuers vnderstandynges of one worde, serue hym for hys goblettes, hys gallys, and his iuglynge stycke in all the proper poyntes of hys hole conuayaunce and hys lygier de mayne / but as I sayde, yf by fayth he meane hope: I graunte that it dyeth not alwaye wyth the synne, nor gothe not therwyth away. But it waxeth by Tyndals doctryne oftētymes ouer grete. For by the dredeles truste of theyr techyng, the man falleth into boldenesse of synne. In whiche when he hath ferelesse longe contynued / he waxeth forcelesse and carelesse, and setteth not by synne, tyll sodeynly the deuyll out of hys hyghe  harte & hawte corage stryketh hym into cowardouse drede and vtter desperacyō. For ye outragyouse encrease of theyr hope, is no very ryght hope, though it be a greater hope then it sholde be / no more then the hete of a feuer is a ryght naturall hete, though the body be more hote then it was in helth. And therfore in suche affeccyons the soule somtyme falleth from one contrary qualyte in to a nother / as ye body in an agew chaūgeth from colde to hete, and frō hete some tyme into colde agayne. Of whiche maner of chaunges of the soule, whom the deuyll dryueth out of one vice into his contrary / may be well veryfyed these wordes of holy scrypture, They shall frō colde water of the snowe, go into farre passynge hete.
                        Iob. 24.
                      And yet I say that with these synnes, a trew member may lese all hope and fall in dyspayre / and after

by grace come vnto hope agayne.

                  I saye also that all hys gaye goodly tale that he telleth vs here, of hys electe membres wyth theyr holy felynge fayth / to whom he wold approper some specyall pryuylege of kepynge styll fayth, hope, & cheryte, wyth all theyr heuy hepe of horryble deuelysshe dedes / I saye that as farforth as in hys wordes is any treuth, hys pryuylege is not proper to the membres of hys electe chyrche, but comon to the  very fynall electes, & to the fynall reprobatys to. For bothe the tone and the tother may synne and repente, and amend and synne agayne, and amende agayn of

But he that fynally repenteth hys synnys in a ryght fasshyon, is an electe foresene to god from the begynnynge. And he that finally dyeth impenytēt, as dyuers wedded freres dye in theyr lechery / or he that after Tyndals doctryne repenteth without care of shryft, & dyeth in a fals heresie agaynst hys holy howsell: such folkes be fynally reprobates, fore knowen vnto god before the worlde was wrought, yt they wolde fynally for impenytence fall vtterly to nought.
                  And the other part of hys tale, whyche can not be veryfyed in the reprobatys, that is to wytte the kepynge of cheryte  styll in the doynge of horryble dedes, can not be veryfyed in the electes neyther. And so is his tale on euery syde folysshe, false, and nought. For the semely settynge forthe wherof to make it appere fayre and lykely / bycause he can neyther bryng reason, scripture, nor other good authoryte: ye shall now se what ensample he bryngeth forth.

                  And now to proue vs thys wonderfull straunge paradox, thys opynyon inopinable, to be very playne, open, euydent, and clere / he furnyssheth it wyth samples so feble and so dymme, that the faynt syghte of our sore eyes can scant attayne to perceyue, how the samples any thynge touche the mater.
                  
                  For where he sholde to make vs clerely beholde it, put hys ensemples in greate and horryble dedes, suche as hym selfe before in another chapyter confesseth that hys holy membres do: he forgetteth here now suche horryble dedes as wolde make the reders abhorre the doers of them, and speketh fayre & easely that they be feble somtyme in temptacyon, and than they can not stande / and that after they haue synned theyr fayth is faynte, and when they sholde helpe theyr neyghboure theyr loue is colde, and they be not pacyent in trybulacyōs, and when they suffer wronge they can not forgyue lo, and when men take away theyr goodes they be angry, so they be lo.
                  Lo how angry Tyndale is wyth hys trew membres of his electe chyrche, and how sore he layeth theyr synnes to  theyr charge. And yet bycause we sholde take theyr fautes for myche the sleyghter, he mynyssheth all the mater and maketh it myche the lesse, by resemblynge and lykenynge them to a good lytell chylde, as though theyr fawtes were all but chyldyshnes / and as it were a babe that wepeth and waxeth angry wyth the kyghte, for catchynge awaye hys brede and butter, and wold complayne to hys mother, and byd her go take a rodde and bete the kyght.
                  But syth that Tyndale now goth aboute to playe the the mayster, and sette all the catholyke chyrche agayne to scole / and wolde haue vs lerne suche harde lessons as we neuer herde of the lyke / as that men maye comenly do myscheuouse

And therfore we shall pray hym to lette passe ouer for thys onys hys longe chyldysshe ensample of hys good chyld, which for all the nurture of hys father and hys mother, and all the wysedome that he lerned of them, and all his loue to them and to theyr cōmaundementes, and all the trust in his fathers promyses, for whyche he goth with  good wyll to scole / fyndynge yet by the waye some companyons that fall to playe, is ra

                  Now syth we haue for ensample taken no lytell prety synnes, but great and horryble dedes / and haue also taken for ensample no lytell prety boy, but an olde greate knaue fytte and mete for the mater, as in whom may well and cō

                  ye remember good reders that he sayth, that hys trewe membres vppon greate occasyons, as vppon the syghte of suche thynges as delyteth them, be rauesshed of theyr memory, and forget them selfe (as hys lytell good chylde doth at the syghte of the playe) and so contynueth styll in the folowynge and fulfyllynge of hys luste, as it were a man in hys slepe or one that laye in a traunce / and neyther is hys fayth loste in all that whyle, nor his loue to the law of god / but though they lye hydde, yet they contynue styll bothe twayne, and hys hope and hys truste in god also. And therfore though our Iak slouche do all those horryble dedes y• we dyd put for ensample: yet beynge a trewe member of Tyndals electe chyrche, bycause of hys felyng fayth which so lyeth hydde in hys harte that he feleth no thynge therof / he consenteth not in hys mynde to none of those dedes, nor doth none of them wyllyngly nor of purpose, or at the leste

                  we myghte here lette Iak slouche alone / & aske Tyndale whyther a nother slouche of hys acquayntaunce hys owne mayster Marten Luther, not onely a trewe member but also one of the chyefe membres of hys electe chyrche, hath lyen all thys whyle a slepe by the space of so many yeres to gether, syth he fyrst ranne out of hys order in apostasye, and after wedded hys nonne, & yet contynueth with her styll. Thys frere and hys nonne, dranke well of lykelyhed ere they went to theyr bryde bedde, yf they lye styll and  slepe yet.
                  But for as myche as Tyndale wyll not agre, that frere Luthers lechery wyth hys nonne, is any euyll dede at all, but very well done & vertuously: therfore though we nede none other ensample agaynste hys frantyke heresye to the earys of any good chrysten man, yet for Tyndale hym selfe we muste leue Luther lyenge styll a slepe wyth hys lēman, and retourne agayne to Iak slouche / whose dedes Tyndale wyll graunte and agre to be horryble, though he deny them to be dampnable bycause of Iakkes felynge fayth / whyche though he fele it not bycause he lyeth a slepe, kepeth in hym styll yet the loue to goddes lawe, and suffereth hym not to consent vnto the synne, nor to do any suche dedes wyllyngly nor of purpose, or at the leste wyse not  malycyously.
                  Let euery man here agaynste Tyndals folyshe tale and shamelesse inuencyon, take testymony and wytnesse of hys owne wytte / whyther he that by the deuyls entycement defowleth hys mother, poyseneth hys father, and mordereth hys brother, and mocketh almyghty god, and suche other horryble and abomynable dedes oftentymes, doth delyberately wyth longe deuyce and studye bystowed about it, do thys gere wyllyngly and consent there vnto / or ellys doth all vnwyllyngly, as he were a slepe or in a traunce. Let Tyndale tell vs what he wyll / he shall I wene fynde no wyse man in thys poynt agre, that these bestes do theyr detestable dedes vnwyllyngly, wythout consent vnto synne.
                  Now towchynge Tyndals tother goodly refuge, that

the horryble dedes of hys trew membres of hys elect chyrche  be neuer dedely synnes, bycause they do them neuer of no malyce: thys is be ye sure a very comely deuyce, whych euery wyse man ye wote well muste nedes alowe and commende. For in our ensample of Iak slouche / what indyfferent iudge wolde not holde the good man excused of all those abomynable dedes, yf it myghte appere to the court, that y• defoylyng of hys mother was not for any dyspyght or malyce borne to hys father, but of vnnaturall affeccyon and very bestely luste. And also that the poysenynge of his father, grew not of anger or euyll wyll to hys person, but of loue and longynge for hys substaunce / and suche other excusys lyke, for all hys other detestable crymes, wherupō it myghte appere, y• none of them all rose of anger or euyll wyll / but some of pryde, some of couetyce, some of lechery, or such other rybaldouse appetyt. what coulde hys iudge in suche case saye to hym for very pytye, yf the poore man sayde onys he were sory / but stroke hys hed, and byd hym go home, and be a good sonne, and do so no more. And therfore for as myche as the same Iak slouche dothe none of those detestable dedes of pure malyce to any other body, but of some kynde of affeccyon towarde hym selfe, hys loue is not vtterly quenched / and therfore he is one of Tyndals electes, that synneth neuer how bad so euer he be.
                  For where as fynally Tyndale techeth vs, that his trew membres of hys electe chyrche do neuer synne dedely, bycause that after the luskes haue played out all theyr lustes, then they repent agayne and remember them selfe & theyr fathers formar kyndenes, and be sory: thys is a fayre tale  of a tubbe tolde vs of hys electes. For euery man well woteth that thus do the fynall reprobates, and be by dew repentaunce dyuers tymes in theyr lyues restored agayne to the state of grace. And then by thys tale of Tyndale, were there no dede dāpnable nor dedely synne in any man, were it neuer so abomynable / but onely those last synnes in whiche he dyed impenitent. And then were all Tyndals hyghe descrypcyons and dyfferences of electes and reprobates all brought to thys poynt at the laste, that theyr dedes be all one, and theyr fasshyons and theyr faythes and theyr louys to the lawe of god a lyke chaungeable thorow the remanaunt of theyr lyues, sauynge that the tone sorte dye repentaunt, and the tother sorte impenytent. And thys is the

                      same thynge that we saye. And so is Tyndale after all his longe folysh varyaunce, at laste maugry his teth agaynst hys purpose, compelled to saye the same that we haue all waye sayed and he alwaye denyed.
                  But then saye we one thynge forther, that where as the electes be by hys owne agreement the penytentes onely and the trewe repentauntes: neyther hym selfe whyche repenteth not his abomynable heresyes, but stuburnly standeth by them and sayth he wyll dye in them / nor his mayster Marten Luther, whyche notwythstandynge that the luske hath often tymes played out his luste, wyll not yet leue his lechery, but lye styll with the nonne, and defende for lawfull matrymony theyr fylthy lyfe that is afore god and all good men a very bestely bychery / shew them selues  clerely to be any of the trewe penytentes / but vtterly to be such, as but yf they repent better ere they dye, shall elles be none of goddes fynall electes, but very wreched reprobates accursed out of goddes company, and myserable membres of the deuyls dampned chyrche in hell.
                  yet sayth Tindale forther in y• ende of all thys chapiter, that all be it the olde kyndenesse of the father can not let the good chylde vtterly dyspayre, for all that he hath played at spurne poynt by the waye in goynge at scolewarde: yet all the world can not set his harte at reste, vntyll the payne be past, and vntyll he haue herde the voyce of his father that all is forgyuen.
                  
                  These wordes wolde I haue Tyndale apply me well to hys gostely purpose / and turnynge the sample of hys good chylde into some olde shrewe, and the playenge at spurne  poynt into some detestable dede: let Tyndale then tell vs, where, what voyce, and by whom, hys trew member of his elect chyrche shall here that voyce of remyssyon. If he mene any worde spoken in scrypture all redy / then is he soone spedde, and shall not after hys synfull cryme cōmytted, fall at any greate conflycte in hym selfe bytwene hope and dyspayre, hys fayth almoste catchyng a fall for fere, and at last wyth myth worke rysynge agayne. All thys gere is soone done, yf the voyce of hys father grauntynge remyssyon set hys harte at reste, and that voyce be hys worde wryten in scrypture / for then he herde the worde before he dyd ye dede. And that worde beynge suche / yf it were vnderstanden as Tyndale techeth, that forthwyth at the bare repentynge without shryft or penaūce, all were forgyuē, synne, payne,

and all, bothe eternall and temporall, bothe in hell and  purgatory and in this worlde to: that worde were than I say all redy bifore the dede, not a forgyuenes onely of the synne passed, but a lycence almoste also of all horryble dedes to be done. And if he meane to here the voyce of his father afterwarde, not wrytten before / he muste here it by the mouthe of his goostely father vpon his humble shryfte and confessyon, whiche Tyndall calleth the crafte and inuencion of Sathan.
                  And this is lo the conclusion of Tyndall in this his chapitre, of his false faithe euer assawted / whiche is as ye se nowe taken here with assawte, pece mele on euery syde wounded, spoyled, and bounden / and quycke of felyng as any blayne or botche, but vtterly dede of grace sent downe vnto the deuyll.
                  
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  The maner and ordre of our election.
                  
                     
                        EVyn so goth it wyth goddes electes. God choseth them fyrste, and they not god, as thou redest Iohn̄. 15 And then he sendeth forth and calleth theym, and sheweth them hys good wyll which he beareth vnto them, and maketh them se both theyr owne dampnacion in the lawe, and also the mercy that is layed vp for them in Christes blode, and thereto what he will haue them do. And then when we se his mercy, we loue him agayne, and chose hym, and submitte our selues vnto his lawes to walke in them. For when we erre not in wytte, reason, and iudgement of  thinges, we can not erre in wyll and choyse of thinges. The choyse of a mans wyll dothe naturally and of her owne accorde, folowe the iudgement of a mans reason, whether he iudge right or wronge. So that in teachinge, onely resteth the pythe of a mans lyuinge.

But he spake there of that eleccyon onely, by whiche he chose and elected thē to be hys apostles and messengers, to be sent about the worlde to prech hys gospel / as playnly appereth by those aforesayd wordes, I haue chosen you, & appoynted you to go and bryng in fruyt / and fynally is the same eleccyon, wherof he spake whan he sayd,
                        Iohā. 6
                      Haue I nat elected and chosen you twelue, & lo one of you is a deuyll. And therfore as I say, the man layeth the scrypture very farre from hys mater.
                  But now takyng him as he wold say if his wyt wold serue

                      him, yt is to wyt that by his worde electes, he meneth the fynall and eternall electes: lette vs se and consider what high doctrine and before vnherde, maister Tindall techeth vs of them.
                  He sayeth that after that god hathe chosen them (and telleth nat whan / whither after their commynge into the worlde, or before the worlde were made / so that he leaueth it by those wordes yet in doubte which eleccion he moueth, whether vnto saluacion in the churche tryumphaunte in heuen, or onely in to the churche here milytaunte in erthe) god he sayeth sendeth forthe and calleth vpon them, and sheweth them his good wyll whiche he bereth vnto them.
                  
                  Nowe here falleth Tyndall in two fautes. One is that these wordes of hys can nat be verifyed vpon all electes,  syth many dye in theyr cradelles, and many in theyr crysosomes / but yf he teken all those for none electes, bycause they can vnderstande no prechynge. A nother faute is, y• y• thyng whiche he semeth here to approper vnto the electes, be commune bothe to the electes and reprobates. For all this god dothe to them to, that are nat his electes, but vnto suche also as wyll be & therfore shalbe, fynall reprobates. For god of his goodnes wyllinge as the scripture sayth all men to be saued / sent his sonne in to this worlde, to call vpon the whole worlde. And he sent his apostelles aboute the worlde as a lorde and god indifferent, without accepcyon of persones as sayd saynt Peter.
                  But than gothe Tyndall farther and sayth, that god maketh his electes see bothe theyr owne dampnacion in the lawe, and also the mercye  that is layde vp for them in Christes bloode, and therto what he wyll haue them do.
                  
                  These wordes men wolde wene were but well & plainly ment. For they may seme to good playne meanynge men, to be well & plainly spoken, and as well and plainly ment. But yet as ye shall shortely see in these wordes, that god maketh his electes se his mercy / as playne wordes as they be, and as innocent and as simple as they seme, yet in them meneth Tyndale couertly to come forthe with his poyson of false prechynge the predestinacyon of god, with destrucion of the fre wyll of man concernynge any maner of deuoure of them selfe towarde the 
                        •

                        ••
                     neth here, that god alway maketh the electes to se these thynges, without any wyll of theyr owne any thynge workynge

with god towarde the syght thereof / and that all the  reprobates that shalbe dampned for lacke of the beleue, be reprobated and reiected and lefte vnchosen, and kept from the syght and perceyuynge of the thynges to be beleued, without any demeryte or euyll deserte of theyr owne, onely bicause god lyste nat to make them see.
                  And that Tyndale thus falsely meneth by those fayre playne wordes / ye shall farther perceyue by other wordes of Tyndals owne wrytynge, afterwarde in his answere to to the fyrste chapyter of the thyrde boke of my dyaloge. For where as I there shewed, that the very bokes of the scripture if selfe, can nat make men beleue yt scripture, nor very surely knowe whyche were the very true scripture of god, and whiche were scriptures countr

                      thynge, that shulde be vnto hys pleasure and the saluacyō of theyr owne soules / whych kynde & prayour they myght assente vnto wythout any preiudyce of theyr owne fayth. wolde he not also counsayle them to faste and forbere women, to the entent theyr prayour myghte be the more clene and pure / and aduyse them also to gyue good almoyse for goddes sake, as dyd Cornelius whō saynt Peter was sent vnto hym therfore. wolde he not also counsayle them to be not wylfull nor obstynate, but conformable and wyllynge to here and lerne the trouth and vpon the herynge therof gladly to prente in theyr hartes those thynges that moste make towarde the mouyng and inclynacyon of theyr myndes, toward the credence therof. And wold he not tell them that thorow suche towarde and wyllynge demeanure on  theyr parte (in the doynge wherof, theym selfe not lackyng nor beyng slouthfull, god wolde not fayle to preuent them wyth hys grace, helpe, & fauour, and be before them) god wolde lede them and go forth with them, & neuer leue them nor forsake them, tyll he wolde wyth theyr owne good endeuoure walkynge and workynge with hym, brynge them fyrste into the ryght bylyefe and good hope and godly cheryte, with other many vertuouse and good wurkes procedyng therupon / & fynally by that meane, after thys transytory lyfe, into ye perpetuall blesse & eternall ioyes of heuen.
                  whyther wolde Tyndale aduyse them thus? whyche yf he dyd / then sholde he teche them that mannys endeuoure towarde fayth, is not a thynge to be mocked as hym selfe mocketh it now / but that mannes own wyll doth somwhat  more towarde it, then doth the chylde to the bygettynge of hys owne father. Or ellys wolde Tyndale forbydde them all suche thynges in any wyse, & tell them that theyr owne endeuoure wolde rather hynder, and make theym ascrybe the fayth that is ye gyfte of god vnto the meryte & goodnes of theyr owne wyll, theyr owne towardenesse, theyr owne prayours, theyr owne cōtynence, almoyse dede, & fastynge, and all theyr other endeuoure. All whyche thynges yf Tyndale take for nought or peryllouse / then is it lykely that he wolde of consequence aduyce those dyscyples of hys to be well ware of all suche thynges, & do none of thē in no wyse, for the counsayle to such thynges coulde come but of betle blynde flesshely reason. And therfore Tyndales dyscyples,

towarde the gettyng of the fayth, to the entent they shulde  take therof no parte vnto theyr owne prayse, but gyue the hole glory to god / sholde I saye by hys aduyse vse none endeuoure at all, nor do no thynge, nor saye no thynge, nor thynke no thynge, but sytte euen styll sadly, and gape by daye agaynste the sonne, by nyght agaynste the mone, tyll eyther some blynde betle or some holy humble bee come flye in at theyr mouthes, and buzze in to theyr brestes an vnholsome hepe of flye blowen errours and motthe eten heresyes.
                  And thus good chrysten readers, the reason that Tyndale maketh vs agaynste the endeuoure of man towarde the attaynynge of fayth / whyche endeuoure he mocketh & calleth it a counsayle of betle blynde reason, bycause fayth is the gyfte of god: I dowte not I saye but that hys reason  is suche, that a man that were betle blynde in dede, may perceyue well inough that Tyndale for lacke of good endeuoure, hath had of the gyfte of god lytell wytte and lesse grace, in makynge of that feble and vnlawfull reason.

                  Lette Tyndale set hys consequente and conclusyon to thys antecedent made of thys reason, and saye, My wytte muste fyrste shewe me some cause eyther trewe or somwhat  semynge trewe, before that my wyll can any thynge do at all: ergo none endeuoure of my selfe in conformynge and applyenge of my wyll, can any thynge do at all.

                     And therfore I say, that god dothe nat ordinaryly gyue  into men the faythe in suche maner / bycause he wyll nat vtterlye take awaye the meryte fro man / for as moche as he hathe ordayned hym to ioye by the meane of some meryte, some conflycte, passyon, or payne vpon his owne parte,

Lyke as we saye that a man maye se to threde a nedle and speke no thyng of the lyght, and yet mene we nat that he can threde it in the darke.
                  
                     And therfore let nat Tyndale loke to bryng vs in darkenesse  / and because mannes wyll can nothynge do without grace, therfore tell vs that mannes wyll can nothynge do, nor tell vs neyther that mannes wyll hath no parte in belefe and faythe / and make vs wene it were so, bicause the wyll can nat as he sayeth go before the wytte / wherof experyence proueth many tymes the contrary, and sometyme with Tyndale to. But thoughe a man can nat haue any wyll at all in that thynge wherof he hathe vtterly nothyng knowen nor herde tell of, nor hadde imagynacion in hys mynde, nor any thynge thought vpon: yet when ye mynde with dyuers reasons and argumentes is ones moued of a mater, the wyll as it happeth of other occasyons at ye tyme to be well or euyll affectionate, so may gyue it selfe into the consent and agrement of the tone syde or of the tother / ye  and that somtyme on that syde for affection, vpon whiche syde he seeth leste parte of his wytte and reason. And therfore it is nat alwaye true that Tyndale sayeth in these wordes,
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     And than whan we se his mercy, we loue hym agayne, and chose hym, and submytte our selfe to his lawes to walke in them.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Here semeth he to gyue as moche to the workynge of mannes wyll concernynge charyte, as he before toke from it concernynge faythe. For here he sayeth that we chose god, and submitte our selfe to his lawes / where as of truth without his grace, bothe preuentyng vs and concurraunt with vs, we can in these thynges neyther, do nothynge  at all.
                  Nowe meneth Tyndall ferther for all this, that mannes wyll in these thynges yet dothe nothynge worke at all but of necessyte. For he sayeth ye god maketh thē to se his mercy by fayth, without any maner working of their wylles, as ye haue herde. And than he sayeth that vpon the sight thereof / they loue god, and chose hym, and submytte them selfe to his lawes. But yet sayeth he, that their wylles do this of ineuitable necessyte. And than can no man if Tyndals lye be trewe, neyther in faythe nor charyte haue any meryte at all. For what can a men deserue, in beleuynge ye thynge that he thoroughly seeth, or in doynge a thynge whan he can do none other. Nowe that Tyndale so saieth,

                      is open and playne by these wordes that he consequentely sayeth.
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     For whan we erre nat in wytte, reason, and iu
                           •
                        ement / we can nat erre in wyll & choyce of thynges. For the choyse of mānes wyll doth naturally and of her owne accorde, folowe the iudgement of a mannes reason whether he iudge ryght or wronge / so that in techynge onely resteth the pythe of a mannes lyuinge.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Here ye se that Tyndale in louynge and chosynge by whiche man loueth and cheseth god, putteth a playne necessyte that mannes wyll can none other do, bycause he seeth the mercy of god by faythe / whiche as Tyndall fayde before, man seeth also of necessyte, and so consequently no  meryte in neyther nother.
                  But Tyndale sayeth vntrue in bothe. For man neyther of necessyte seeth the tone, nor of nece
                        •
                     syte dothe the other, but may do the contrary bothe in the tone and the tother / and therfore in doynge bothe, meryteth in bothe what so euer Tyndale saye.
                  But yet sayeth Tindale vntrue in these other two thinges also / that is to wytte bothe where he sayeth, that whan a man seeth the mercy of god, than he loueth and choseth god, and submytteth hym selfe to walke in goddes lawes / and also where he sayeth for the profe of that poynte, that whan we erre nat in wytte, we can nat erre in will / but that the choyce of the wyll dothe euer folowe the iudgement of the reason. For fyrste what question is there, but that  many whiche ryght surely beleue the mercy of god, do nat yet loue god in suche wyse as is requisite vnto saluacyon / that is in the preferrynge his pleasure before theyr owne, and to forbere synne for the loue of his lawe, and for the regarde of his goodnes to fulfyll hys commaundementes. But we fynde it many tymes farre contrarye, that the ouer great regarde of his mercy, turneth truste into presumpcyon, and maketh men the more bolde in synne / so forsothe that neyther loue of god, nor desyre of heuen, nor drede of hell, is able to pulle them backe.
                  Nowe as touchyng the tother point, that whan we erre nat in wyll and iudgement, we can nat erre in will & choyce of thynges / but that the wyll alway doth naturally accorde and agree to folowe the iudgement of reason, whether it

iudge ryght or wronge: we shal differ the sotletees of that  disputacyon, tyll we come to the place in hys answere vnto my thyrde and fourthe boke of my dyaloge, where I purpose god wyllyng, to touche this matter more full / & wyll at this tyme nothynge els obiecte agaynste hym, than the playnest profe that can be, that is to wytte euery mannes owne experyence and expresse perceyuinge of the contrary. For many a wretche that dothe an abominable dede, seeth and perceyueth full well that he dothe very noughte, and that he shulde nat do so / and his wytte and his reason forbideth hym. But his wyll fallynge from the folowynge of his reason, to the fulfyllyng of his fleshely desyre & beestly luste and deuelysshe appetite, accomplyssheth his detestable dede / nat for any lacke of wyt and reason, but thorowe faute of the frowarde wyll wyttyngly workynge for pleasure  agaynste reason.
                  Many a man that hathe a great wytte and a great reason to, and moche lernynge ioyned vnto them bothe, dothe yet more folysshely and more vnresonably, than doth some other whose wytte and reason is very farre vnder his, and as for lernynge hathe vtterly none at all. And wherof cō
                     meth this? but in that the tone with no lernynge & no great wytte, hath great good wyll to worke with goddes grace and do well / and the tother with moch wytte and lernyng, lacketh the wyll to worke well after his reason / & therefore letteth grace go by, and wylfully foloweth affeccion.
                  And yf Tyndale in this beleue nat me, nor all the wyde worlde besyde / he wyll I truste at the leste wyse beleue him selfe. Nowe than sayeth he in mo places of his boke than  one, that I se the truthe well inoughe, and that I se well inoughe that I shuld nat do as he sayeth I do, wyttingly and wylfully wryte agaynste the truthe. wherin if he wyll nowe confesse that he sayeth vntrue / lette hym reuoke hys lye and call it backe agayn, and than god forgyue him and I do. And if he wyll abyde styll by that worde that he said than / than muste he go fro this worde quyte that he sayeth nowe. For yf I wote well I do nat well, and yet for all that I do it / than is there one man at the leste wyse whose wyll foloweth nat his wytte. And than if I be suche one, I shall nat I truste lyue all alone / but shall rather than fayle, fynde Tyndale hym selfe so good a felowe, as to falcefye his owne wordes here and bere a pore man company.
                  
                     
                      And that his wordes here be very false in dede / dothe yet farther appere by hys conclusyon that he concludeth theron, if his conclusyon do necessarily folowe. For hys conclusyon is this, that in teching onely standeth the pythe of a mannes lyuynge. For if this be false as in dede it is / than if it necessarely folowe vpon hys other wordes, hys other wordes must nedes be as false as it / for vpon a truth nothyng can there folowe but truthe, as euery man lerned well knoweth.
                  But nowe knoweth euery man very well, that all the pythe of a mannes lyuynge standeth nat in onely techyng. For many be full well taught howe they shulde lyue, ye & so well taught that they be able to teche it other full well / & yet lyue them selfe full nought. we shall nat nede to seke  longe for ensample, syth no man douteth but that Iudas Scariothe had so good a scole mayster, and was with him so longe, that if he had any wyt he was metely well taught howe he shulde lyue. And that he was nat all wytlesse, thoughe by defaute of good wyll

                           .
                      And yet as well taught as he was, and as well as he taught other to / yet was hys owne lyuynge nat very good, whyle he was bothe a the
                        •
                     e and a traytour bothe to god and man.
                  And yet that we shall nat nede to seke so farre as fyftene hundred yere ago / I wene it wyll be no great difficultie to fynde folke inoughe euyn nowe in our owne tyme, that can  preche and gyue good counsayle to theyr neyghbours, agaynste the vyces in whiche they lyue them selfe. So that thoughe to good lyuynge, good techynge be necessary / yet may euery fole se that in good techynge, standeth nat all y• pythe of good lyuynge, as Tyndale sayeth it dothe / sythe many men haue ben well taught, and yet lyued nought.
                  But this wyse reason amonge many lyke, lerned Tyndale of his mayster Luther / whiche at wormes in Almayne at his beynge there before the Emperour sayd, that yf the gospell were well taughte, there shulde nede none other lawe. And this sayd he there, & this sayeth Tyndale here / bycause they and theyr felowes wolde fayne take away all lawes, and leaue nothynge but sermons. And than after that theyr vngracious he

                     esyes myght be frely preched for

                  But Tyndale in this matter whā he hath tolde vs this tale, that the pythe of mannes lyuynge standeth all to gether in techynge / he addeth thervnto by and by & sayeth,
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     Howe be it there be swyne that receyue no lernynge but to defyle it / and there be dogges that rent all good lernynge with theyr tethe.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  If there be suche swyne and suche dogges as in dede  there be, as our sauyour hym selfe wytnesseth in the gospell / if this I say be truthe as it is,
                        Matth. 7.
                      that Tyndale telleth vs nowe / than is it false that Tyndale tolde vs afore, that is to wytte that all standeth in techynge. For those swyne & those dogges will be nought for all the good techyng. And than to kepe suche from doynge harme, we must nat onely teche and preche / but vnto suche as wyll be lyke swyne, we muste yoke them for brekynge hedges, and rynge them for wrotynge, and haue bande dogges to dryue them out of y• corne with bytynge, and leade them out by the eres.
                  And yf there be suche dogges as in dede there be, that rent all good lernynge wyth theyr teth / then standeth not all the pyth of good lyuynge in good teachynge. For what auayleth to tech them that wyll not lerne but rent all good  lernyng wyth theyr teth. And therfore to such dogges men may not onely preche, but muste with whyppes and battes bete them well, and kepe them from terynge of good lernyng with theyr dogges tethe / ye and from barkyng both / and chastyce them and make them couch quayle, tyll they lye styll and herken what is sayde vnto them. And by suche meanes be bothe swyne kepte from doynge harme, & dogges fall somtyme so well to lernynge, that they can stande vp vppon theyr hynder fete, and holde theyr handes afore them pretely lyke a mayde, ye and lerne to daunce to after theyr maysters pype / suche an effectuall thynge is punysshement, where as bare techynge wyll not suffyce.
                  And who be now more proprely suche dogges, then be

                      these heretykes that barke agaynste the blessed sacramentes, and tere wyth theyr dogges tethe the catholyke chrystē fayth, and godly exposycyons of the olde holy doctours & sayntes? And who be more proprely suche hoggys, then these heretykes of our dayes, of such a fylthy kynde as neuer came before / whyche in suche wyse defyle all holy vowed chastyte, that the very pure scripture of god they trede vppon wyth theyr foule dyrty fete, to drawe it from all honest chastyte, into an vnclene shamefull lybertye of frerys to wedde nonnes. And therfore vnto these hogges & these dogges ye pyth of good lyuyng standeth not all in techyng. For no good thynge wyll they lerne wythout bytynge and betynge.
                  yet goeth Tyndale forther and sheweth mo kyndes of  folke / to whom for all his other wordes all ye pyth of good lyuynge standeth not in techynge.

                  These wordes lo good reder, expowne very well & very playne declare, what techynge it is that Tyndale all thys whyle so bosteth, wherin he sayeth all the pyth of good lyuynge onely standeth / that is as he taketh it, the techynge of hys abomynable heresyes, in whyche he techeth vs that onely fayth suffyseth, and that neyther good workes haue reward in heuen, nor that any euyll workes shall haue any punysshement eyther in thys worlde or in purgatory
                        •
                      no  nor in hell neyther, yf the synner be but a bare penytent & onely byleue and repent, and be well ware in any wyse that he go to no shryfte nor do no penaunce for hys synne. For all those that do, they be those of whom he rayleth here and calleth pope holy, & sayeth they make them self a ryghtuousnes of theyr owne faynynge / and resyste the ryghtuousnes of god in Chryste, bycause they resyste Tyndals vnryghtuouse heresyes / whyche vnder pretexte of goddes onely mercy, taketh awaye goddes ryghtuousnes / and not onely that, but vnder the same pretexte of praysynge and settynge forth a more mercy, couertely and craftely depraueth and dysprayseth the very trewe mercy it selfe, that god of hys godnesse ordynaryly vseth towarde vs.
                  For Tindale maketh as though it were no mercy at all,

after a lytell penaunce in thys worlde done by the partye  for many great mortall synnes / or after a temporary payne endured in purgatory, to set the mery

                  yet goeth he fynally forther to a nother kynde of suche folke, as techynge can not for a whyle helpe, and yet after doth / and of them thus he sayth.

                  Lo good reders here ye maye se, what constaunce is in thys man, here he sayth (and sayth trewe) that men wyll at some tyme not lerne nor harken to the trouth, though it be neuer so well taught them. And yet in a nother chapyter before, he sheweth that the electes as soone as euer they be taughte the trouth, assente forthwyth and wyll neuer resyste / so he that hath a false parte to defende, neuer woteth where to holde hym.

                  Nowe that Tyndale thus meneth, appereth playne by the whole processe of his worke. wherin as concernynge saluacyon and dampnacyon, he laboreth to make vs wene that the wyll of man dothe nothynge wyllyngly, but were vtterly forced and ineuitably necessytat by the eternal eleccyon of god vnto glory and his eternall reprobacyon vnto payne / whiche is as moche, as to say that the wyll of man is no wyll at all, any more than as he myght saye that the wyll of, a tre were to growe and brynge forthe frute & leaues, and that the wyll of an axe were to hewe downe the tre whan a man smyteth the tre therwith.

And thys though he thus mene, yet doth he dyssymule it / and sayth not, that bycause mercy wayteth euer vpon̄ them, therfore they muste nedes ryse after theyr fall / but bycause mercy wayteth vpon them, therfore they shall ryse. But thys poynt he layeth so open in many places of his worke, that it is but a folysshe wylynes of hym to wene it well couered thus.
                  wherfore he were as good to speke out playnely, & tell vs whyther he mene, y• after a fall mercy wayte any more vpon any reprobate or not.

And thē must he tell euery man, how he may know  hym selfe for electe / leste he maye wene that they pertayne not to hym.

                     And yet natwithstandinge that he semeth to assygne the  cause of the rysynge of his electes out of theyr synne, to be by the mercy of god alwaye waytyng vpon them / yet handeleth he the mater so, that a man may nat well wytte by these wordes of his, whether he meane that whā his electe is sonken downe into his traunces, and fallen a slepe in his lustes as he calleth it for a season / whether he meane I say that mercy calleth vpon hym in his traunce, & shaketh hym out of his slepe, or els let him slepe styll in hys lustes, and the deuyll rocke the cradle tyll the babe awake by him selfe. And surely he rather semeth to say, that god nat awaketh hym out of his luste / but letteth hym slepe in his luste vntyll his luste haue lefte him. As though goddes callyng of men from glotony, were nat to put them in mynde and call vpon them besely, and inspyre good thoughtes of temperaunces  whyle they be at theyr mete / but lette them than alone as in a traunce and a slepe, tyll they be so wery of eatynge, that the grefe and gryndyng in theyr belyes standynge a strutte with stuffynge, call theym vp and awake them. And that is a good easy waye to / for than be they the more easy to entreate, to faste and forbere / but nat moche lenger than tyll they waxe an hungered agayne. And as it fareth in the traunces and slepes that folke fall in by the bely / so fareth it lykewyse in the traunces and slepes that folke fall in by those partes that are benethe the bely. For whan the rage is thereof (as Tyndall sayeth) ouer passed, and that they haue in theyr traunce and theyr slepe played out all theyr luskysshe lustes / than they awake. And than as sone as they be awake / they repent as Tyndale sayeth, ano come agayne to chastyte without resystence. But euer more I wold that Tyndale shulde remembre, that all this tale whiche he telleth vs here, is for his purpose of electes a tale of very lytell effecte. For this tale of suche slepynge and awakynge of electes, is nothing propre to the electes / but a thynge commune bothe to the electes and to the reprobates to. And these rages, and these traunces, & these slepes in synfull flesshely lustes, into whiche folke fall, and out of whiche they wake agayne and repent / the thynge that Tyndale telleth vs here as a thynge farre fatte and sought, and serched out of the very botome of his depe diuinite / ye same thyng in a maner as for thus farforthe, doctour Ouide descrybeth vs well & plainly, in his pleasaunte

                      poetry entytled the remedy of loue. where he declareth after Tyndals fasshyon full clerkely, how some wanton louers after theyr rages passed and theyr lustes played out, lye then wakyng, and haue medytacyons of amendement, and of leuyng of theyr lecherouse loue euyn lyeng by theyr lemmans sydes, and thynke they wyll come there no more, and wolde wyth good wyll that they hadde not come there than neyther.
                  In thys chapyter whyche Tyndale entytleth the order of eleccyon / I loke alwaye that he sholde as reason is, tell vs those thynges that properly pertayne vnto the electes / & the thynges that contrary wyse appertayne properly to the reprobates / by whyche maner of handelyng of ye mater, we myght clerely perceyue & vnderstande what he meneth,  and what order of goddes wurkyng or of the wurkynge of mannes owne wyll, he putteth in the course & progresse of the tone sorte and the tother towarde theyr fynall ende, the tone of euerlastynge lyfe, the tother of eternall dāpnacyon,
                  And alway whyle I loke for this / Tyndale, besyde that hys conclusyons be false heresyes in the ende, telleth vs no thynge almoste by the waye (excepte onely peraduenture yt laste repentaunce before the deth) but that they be comune as well to the fynall reprobates as to the fynall electes / as thys is also that in hys chapyter foloweth, where he wryteth in thys wyse.
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     God now and than withdraweth his hand, and leueth them vnto theyr owne strength, to make thē fele that there is no power to do good but of god onely / leste they sholde be proude of that whiche is none of theyrs.
                  
               
               
                  
                      More.
                  Tyndale maketh these wordes for a grounde of a great mater, concernynge the order of god vsed towarde the electes. And vpon thys fundacyō he specyally rereth hys byeldynge, of the traunces, and the slepes, and slydinges of the electes into synnes and errours / in whyche synnes yet they synne not, and in whyche errours yet they erre not, bycause of theyr felynge fayth. From whyche though they fall yet they fal not, bycause they fele it still though they fele it not.
                  But what is there good reder in these wordes of hys y• he speketh of the electes, that is not veryfyed bothe in the electes and in the reprobates to. Now yf he say that he speketh here specyally of the electes, bycause at somtyme god wythdraweth hys hand from them, & that from reprobates

he wythdraweth his hande of helpe and grace alwaye. If  he saye thus, he sayth vntrewe. For doeth not god, as he of hys goodnesse calleth them, and at theyr comynge receyueth them / so when they fall awaye by false fayth, or faynte harte, or flesshely delectacyon, calle vppon them agayne, as he doeth vppon hys electys, wythout accepcyon of persons or parcyall fauour indyfferently / tyll he eyther some tyme for theyr immesurable outrage, or comenly for theyr fynall impenytence, fynally reiecteth and refuseth them? Amonge whych fatherly cure and care for them, as well as for hys electes before theyr fynall fall / he vseth the same wayes to wynne & saue them, that he vseth to the other. ye and doth somtyme peraduenture gyue more of hys gracyouse ayde & helpe in this world toward saluacyon in heuen vnto some reprobate wretche, that wyll for all that be damned  / then to some of hys electes, that wyll so wurke wyth hys grace that he fynally shall be saued. As I dowte not but some two soules haue ben saued and now syt in heuen, wyth the tone halfe of the grace that Iudas had, and caste of, and fynally fell into hell.
                  And therfore thys that Tyndale here telleth vs of electes, that god somtyme wythdraweth hys hande and leueth them to theyr owne strength / he maye as well tell vs of the reprobates as of the electes.
                  Now the cause why god wythdraweth hys hande and hys helpe, is not alwaye the cause that Tyndale here alledgeth, bycause he longeth alway to make a glaunce agaynst all the meryt of mannes fre wyll / but to auoyde the pryde of the mynde, and the farre lesse boldnes presumynge vpon  the surtye of hye holy lyuynge or fayth / whyche many men maye fall in by takynge them selfe for god almyghtys mynyons, though they gyue all the thanke to hym selfe, and ascrybe no thynge to theyr owne strength at all, nor wene they haue no fre wyll at all neyther.

                      though he were proude of hys dedes, yet ascrybed them not vnto hym self, nor sayd not all thys haue I done good lord of myne owne strength. But he sayd, I thanke the therof good lorde that I am suche / and that thou haste made me better, and gyuē me the grace to lyue more holyly then thys publycane / and sayed not, I thanke therof my selfe.

                  Another false entent wherfore Tyndale telleth vs thys tale of withdrawynge of goddes hande somtyme from his electes, is bycause he wolde haue it stande with his heresye that he gothe so faste about / that is to wytte that the electes do not sinne dedely in theyr dedely synnes, bycause they do it nat wyllyngly but of infirmyte for lacke of power.

This is Tyndalles entent in this matter, by whiche he excuseth the synne of the electes by the withdrawynge of goddes hande from them / nor for any defaute of theyr owne, or any synne that they haue done,

                  Fyrste for they neuer synne but vpon greate occasyōs farre aboue their strength. Secondely, for after theyr horryble dedes done, they repent vpon rebukyng without resystence.

                      And thyrdely (whiche mooste is of all) all the whyle that they be in doynge, the poore babes wote nere what they do, but be all the whyle a slepe, as he putteth here his ensample by Dauid. And therfore lette vs consydre Dauid his dedes with Tyndals wordes, & examyne in them these thre godly reasons.
                  Fyrste he sayeth that Dauid synnes arose vpon great occasyons aboue Dauid his strength / whiche great occasyons god suffred to fall vpon hym and cary hym awaye. For whan he wolde haue slayne Naball and all his sonnes euen to the childe in the cradell, he fell nat into that mynde without great occasyon ye wote well. For the rude felowe had as Tyndale well reherseth, gyuen hym a churlyshe answere. And what man were there so vnreasonable, yt wolde  not thynke that a kynge or a great man had cause inough to kyll twenty paysans & vyllayns, for a churlysh answere of one of them? Now when he fell to aduoutry & therby to manslaughter / had he not a great occasyon to it & importable to bere? For he saw y• woman as he loked out at his wyndow. And therfore who so euer haue ones the syght of a womā, is excusable yf he take her when he can catche her / & no man greatly to blame, but eyther a blynde man, or he that taketh one in y• darke whom he neuer saw in y• lyghte.
                  But we must here yet remēber lest we mystake Tyndale, that these great & stronge occasyōs were not so very greate & stronge of thē selfe / but they were as Tyndale sayth strō
                     ger then Dauyd, and able to cary hym awaye
                        •
                      whych
                        •
                      he sayth, to shew vs yt they were of y• strength in cōparison of  y• person, not so mych by the force & strength of theyr owne nature, as by ye lyghtnes, fraylty, & feblenes of Dauid / as a small burdē is a great wayght vpō a child, & able to bere hī downe / & a lytell wynd able inough to blow away a fether.
                  Then wolde ye wene that he accuseth Dauyd and the electes, bycause they be so lyght and so frayle to falle vpon suche occasyons as be stronge to them, by reason of theyr owne feblenesse. Nay forsoth. For here ye muste remember that to prouyde theym theyr excuse in thys poynt, was the cause for whyche as I tolde you before he layed for a fundacyon / that god at soche tymes fyrste wythdraweth hys hande of hys helpe, & then muste they nedes be weke, feble, and frayle. And so theyr fall cometh of the occasyons / & the occasyons be myghty to them, by reason of theyr feblenesse.

And theyr feblenesse cometh of the wythdrawynge of goddes  hande. And he wythdraweth it wythout any desert and defawte of them, onely to kepe them from the synne of takyng their good workes for theyr owne. And so is there in all the progresse of theyr dede, n

                  And thys is as ye se the fyrste goodly cause, for whiche Tyndale wyll make vs wene, that the abomynable dedes of electes be no dedely synnes bycause of the greate occasyons. Agaynste whyche yf the mater were worth the argument, we wolde prece vppon hym sore wyth the synnes of the reprobates / and bere hym in hande that some of theym haue as greate occasyons of theyr synnes somtyme, as is  a churlysshe answere to the kynge of a man, or the syght of a naked woman out at a wynddwe for aduowtry. And we wolde then aske hym suche questyons forther, eyther of holdynge of goddes hande ouer them, or wythdrawynge hys hande of helpe from them, wyth other dyuerse dependauntes theruppon, whyche euery ler

                        •
                      whiche when Tyndale sholde answere to / he sholde soone make euery wyse man se, that in thys chapyter of the order of theyr eleccyon, he hath elected and chosen a very folysshe order.
                  But for as myche as the foly therof is open and playne of it selfe / we shall let the forther dyspycyons of thys poynt passe,
                        1. Corinth. 10.
                      as agaynst which saynt Poule playnely speketh and sayth vnto vs, God is faythfull whyche suffereth you not  to be tempted aboue y• that ye maye bere, but maketh wyth the temptacyon a way out also, that ye maye well weild yt. By whyche wordes thys poynte of occasyons aboue our power is clene caryed awaye / and it is clerely determyned, that god suffereth no suche temptacyon to come vnto vs, but suche as we maye bothe reprobates and electes be able to wythstande if we wyll, thorow the assystence of goddes gracyous hande / whiche he neuer wythdraweth but in the fawte of our owne wyll, and neuer denyeth to put it forth vnto vs yf we call therfore and wyll take holde vppon it. And therfore syth as I saye the reprofe of thys fyrst poynt is playne / I wyll now passe it ouer and se what substaunce is in the seconde.
                  
                     
                      The seconde thynge is, that as soone as they be rebuked and theyr fawtes tolde them, they repente immedyately and turne agayne mekely. For thys he sayd .ii. or .iii. tymes in two or thre chapyters / and now he confermeth it wyth hys ensample of Dauyd, whyche dyd so as he sayth at bothe tymes.
                  But yet is thys but barely layed forth for the order of y• electes. For of trouth thus do some reprobates to amōge repente, not onely when they be rebuked, but also before to / and be forgyuen at theyr repentaunce and penaunce as well as be ye electes as longe as they do so repente, tyll they be dampned bycause they dye at laste impenytent.
                  And also thys is not proued to be alwaye trewe, that euery electe repenteth at the fyrste rebuke, and mekely returneth  wythout resystence, though Dauyd so dyd twyse. There is I truste many a man in heuen, that was rebuked thryes of some one fawt, and defended it full styffely before he repented, and yet amēded after full well. And for ensample we nede no ferther than the blessed apostles / and specyally saynt Thomas of Inde,

                      whyche lefte not hys dyffydence and dystruste, neyther at the fyrste spekynge nor the seconde, nor tyll he put hys fynger in god almyghty hys syde. But Tyndale excuseth all that by beynge amased, as he doth all the electes horryble dedes, by beynge in traunces and slepes, as he doth Dauyd here. For that is ye thyrd poynt and the moste specyall excuse of all electes from all dedely synne, in that they be a slepe all the whyle they do it. For thus sayth he of Dauyd, as ye haue herde.
                  
                     
                     How longe slombred he, o

                         rather how harde in slepe was he in the adultery of Bethsaba, and in the murder of her husbonde Vriah.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Dauyd was here in a very longe slomber & a very depe dede slepe in dede, yf he dyd all those deuylysshe dedes in hys slepe. Tyndale of lykelyhed laye nere hym and herde hym all the whyle snorte and 
                        •
                     owte. And yf he so saye that he dyd / then is hys tale as full proued as is any parte of all hys heresyes. And except he saye it of hys owne certayn knowlege, he shall ellys neuer make me byleue, y• Dauyd dyd spye her, and sent for her, and talke wyth her, and gete her wyth chylde, and sent for her husbande, and deuyse the murder, & wryte ye leter, & sent the man to hys deth, and all these dedes in dyuers dayes, & all thys whyle styll a slepe.
                  
                     But Tyndale wyll haue hym a slepe nedes, for the defence  of hys owne folysshe heresye, wherby he techeth vs y• the electe is by fayth borne of god, and therfore doth neuer synne wyllyngly, nor consent to synne, nor caste of the yoke of the lawe, nor the loue to the lawe of god. And therfore he sayth,
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     Now in all that longe tyme from the adultery of Bethsabe vntyll the prophet Nathan rebuked hym, he had not loste his fayth nor his loue vnto the lawes of god, no more then a man loseth his wyttes whyle he is a slepe.
                  
               
               
                  More
                  Lo bycause he was all this whyle a slepe / therfore in all thys whyle he loste neyther fayth nor loue to the lawe, no more then a man loseth hys wyttes when he is a slepe. Is not here a wyse tale trowe ye? excepte that Tyndale hadde eyther loste hys wyttes, or els were hym selfe a slepe whyle  he wrote thys / he coulde neuer for shame tell vs thys tale. what calleth he losynge of fayth or loue? no thyng but such departynge therof, as he neuer cometh to it agayn? If that be so / then Tyndale setteth our sauyour Chryste to scole, and techeth hym to speke. For he sayth in the gospell, that a man loste one of hys hundred shepe,
                        Lucae. 15.
                      and lefte the remanaunt and soughte the loste shepe, and founde it. And that the woman had lost her money, though by ransakynge vp her howse and sekynge she founde it at laste agayne. Now Tyndale is not so madde I suppose, as to saye that yf a man lette fall hys rynge in the mayne see, though he fynde it fyue wekes after in a fishes maw, that therfore he neuer loste it bycause he fyndeth it agayne. The comon peple say amonge, that nothynge can be founden tyll it be loste / sauynge  yt of a thefe they saye in sporte, he can fynde a thyng ere it be loste / and so they prayse hym in hys cunnyng, that he can do suche a maystry as no trew man can.
                  Now yf a thyng may be loste in dede for a season, though it be after founden agayne / how proueth Tyndale here, yt Dauyd in all thys longe whyle bytwene the fyrste syght of Bethsabe and the rebuke of Nathan, neuer loste neyther fayth nor loue.
                  He proueth it vs in this wyse by ensāple. A man yt lyeth a slepe leseth nat his wyttes / and therfore in likewyse Dauid lyenge in lechery, loste neyther faythe to god nor loue to his lawe. Is nat this well lykened? yes by my she

                      proue vs thorowly that Dauid was that whyle in a very slepe in dede.
                  For god hathe naturally prouyded slepe for mannes reste from laboure, and for his refresshynge agayne to laboure. And the withdrawynge of the vse of our wyttes is there nat forbeden by goddes ordinaunce, excepte we slepe whan we shulde nat. And so is neyther aduoutry nor suche maner of manslaughter / but 
                        •
                     e thynges of god forbeden & of theyr nature abomynable. And in the slepe also there is onely a suspendynge of the vse of the wyttes, and no contrary wylfull doynge agaynste the wytte / as there was a wylfull workynge of Dauid, agaynste the faythfull loue of goddes lawe in his horryble dedes.
                  For as for his faythe, as farforthe as concerneth onely  the nature of faythe, that is to wytte of belefe / I wyll well agre with Tyndale that he lost it nat in all the whyle. And in Tyndals faythe for one poynt, in yt he 
                        •
                     ugleth faythe in to hope / I wyll well agree also that Dauid had all that whyle inoughe therof styll, and peraduenture a lytell to moche to.

                      But surely as for the lyuely faythe that worketh as saynt Poule sayeth by loue / that kynde of faythe had he loste for that whyle in which he wyllyngly wrought euyll / except Tyndale say that all his lechery & his manslaughter to, was wrought by loue, bycause all that euer he dyd was done for the loue that he bare to Bethsabe. And if Tyndale tell me so / than dryueth he me to the harde wall. For than can I go no farther in that poynte, but as for as concerneth his faythe I muste nedes gyue it ouer.
                  
                      Howe be it yet as touchynge his loue vnto the lawe of god / very fayne wolde I here howe Tyndale can defende it, that he loste nat that loue in no poynte of all that longe whyle, in whiche he wyllyngly wrought agaynste it, fyrste his foule aduoutry, and after myscheuous manslaughter to. Thys shall I (sayeth Tyndale) defende you well inoughe. For ye touched your selfe ryghte nowe, the very poynte at whiche I wolde my selfe haue you / whan ye said that in the naturall slepe the wytte is onely suspended, and the wyll therwith in lykewyse, so that a man dothe nat wittyngly nor willyngly any contrary acte agaynst the wytte, as ye sayde that Dauid dyd in his dedes. But nowe say I that Dauid dyd none of these thynges wyttyngly nor wyllyngly, but vpon those occasyons his wyttes were rauisshed

awaye / and bothe his wytte and his wyll suspended  as it is in the naturall slepe, so that he had forgotten hym selfe, and for the whyle neyther had wytte nor wyll. For if his wytte had shewed hym hys faute / his wyll muste nedes haue folowed. But his wytte was all that whyle though nat loste, yet caryed away clene with the rage of the luste. And whan the wytte is awaye, the wyll is gone therwith. For it can nothy
                        •
                     ge do but as the wytte sheweth it as I haue sayd before. And than was the wytte a slepe and the wyll folowed the fumes that he fell into the fantesye, and so no consentyng to synne / but as the man was in maner all a slepe, so were all his dedes in maner but a dreme.
                  Here is Tyndals profe pyked out vnto the beste that I can perceyue of his wordes. But nowe this reason of his, neyther defendeth Dauid agaynste the losse of loue, and yet vtterly loseth hym by Tyndals doctryne the most especiall faythe. For Tyndale as ye shall here after rede, calleth the faythe of the electes a felyng faythe. Nowe if Dauid were in a slepe, all that whyle & had thereby forgotten his faythe and hym selfe to / than though his faythe had all the whyle the lyfe, yet at the leste hit loste for the whyle the felynge. For so dothe the man ye wote well in the slepe.
                  But lette this passe this ones as for thys tyme / and se howe he proueth that Dauid was fallen to suche a dede slepe, that he had in all that whyle neyther wytte nor wyll / and therfore consented nat vnto synne agaynste the lawe of god. Profe layeth he none ī this worlde, but onely sayth it was so. Nowe myght he lye by possybilyte, though his  tale were likely. But yet am I content if his tale be lykely, let hym be belyued. But nowe if his tale be very farre vnlykely, reason were he brought one wytnesse wyth hym at the leste.
                  Nowe than whan Dauid firste began to spye her, lette that be chaunce and occasyon of one rysynge in his slepe / but whan he lyked her and longed for her, and stode styll & loked on her, and kyndled his hete hym selfe, and set hym selfe sore a fyre / was he all that whyle a slepe? whanne he thought he wolde haue her, whan he sent his messinger for her; whan he stode and talked with her, whan he brake the matter to her, whan he wanne her assent to the synne, whā he fulfylled his fowle fles

No sayeth Tyndale. I say no more but it is lykely yes. And therfore let Tyndale tell vs whereby he proueth the contrary. I proue it sayeth he by that that he was an elected  persone that fynally shulde be saued / and therfore bycause of that felynge faythe with whiche he was borne of god, he coulde nat consent vnto synne. Uery well. Than if a reprobate had done the lyke vpon the like occasyon or greatter / he had synned dedely, for lacke of felynge faythe, onely bycause he was nat elected. And if he repented alyke vpon lesse occasyon, yet he shulde nat be forgyuen, for lacke of ye felynge faythe which was neuer gyuen hym, but euer kept from hym, onely bycause he was nat elected.
                  If I aske Tyndale here howe he knoweth or why he beleueth, that Dauid was elected to saluacyon / what wyll he answere. He wyll nat say I am sure, bycause the church so techeth hym, leste I shulde aske hym agayne whyche churche. For than were he forced to graunte that he beleueth  the techyng of this comen knowen catholyke churche of ours, sythe that his owne vnknowen churche can teche hym nothyng to be the better beleued vpon the credence of that churche, nat beynge knowen for the churche. Nowe shall he nat fynde as farre as I remembre, any playne euident scripture prouing his finall saluacion. Than if Tyndall answere that he fyndeth in scripture of his faythe and his repentaunces, and nothynge of hys fynall dampnacyon, and therfore he beleueth of these lykelyhedes that he was electe to the fynall saluacyon, and shall come to heuen at the day of dome (for Tyndales secte beleueth nat that he shall come thyther afore) I wyll nat here preace vpon hym with ye samples of suche as he hath sene here lyue well & beleue well after his owne opinyon, bothe whyle he beleued

well hym selfe and syns he beleued wronge, of whose  saluacyon yet he maketh nat him selfe so sure as of the saluacyon of Dauid / but holdynge my selfe for this tyme satisfyed that he beleue it so well vpon good likelyhedes, that he shulde nat beleue a man that wolde without good profe tell hym the contrary / I shall no more but praye hym to be so resonable and so indifferent agayne towarde vs, as to gyue vs leaue in lykewyse to beleue vpon good lykelyhedes that Dauid consented to synne, and nat to beleue him, that without good profe wolde with his bare worde make vs wene the contrary, and boldely bere vs in hande that whyle he wrought so moche wyckednes he was all ye while a slepe.
                  In whiche poynte, as I haue before proued in another chapyter by lyke mater, if he were so a slepe, his very fyrste  fallynge into suche a slepe was hys owne wylfull neclygence / whyle he beginnynge to be moued vnto leudenes at the fyrste syght of Bethsabe, stode styll and fedde hys deuelysshe delyte in beholdynge her, and thereby wyllyngly suffred the dethe of synne to entre into his hart by the glas wyndowes of his eyen
                        •
                      wheruppon all that euer he dyd after pursuyng therupon, all had he bene in such rage that he neyther wyste what he dyd nor where he were shulde haue bene imputed vnto hym / as he that synfully drynketh hym selfe dronke dedely synneth, and shall dye also yf he kyll a man in that dronkenesse.
                  Nor it excuseth nat Dauid nor no man elles that Tyndale sayeth, There is no man so good, but that there cometh a tyme vppon hym, in whyche he fealeth in hym selfe no more fayth or loue vnto god, then  a syke man oftymes feleth the taste of his meate

                      whyther thys happeneth vnto the best men or nat, god wote I can nat tell / I wote nat what affeccions they fele / for I am none of them, nor I fere me Tyndale neyther, as wyse and experte as he maketh hym selfe of theyr felynge. wolde god we were bothe of the beste, so the beste were neuer the worse, nor waxen as euyll as we, and we made theyr matches in that maner wyse. But this dare I surely saye, that whan so euer the best is in such case / it excuseth nat Dauid fro dedely synne. For than is the 
                        •
                     este very nought.
                  And fynally for conclusyon of Dauid his dedes, where Tyndale sayeth he coulde nat synne dedely bicause he was an electe / for whiche cause god kepte hym thorowe the felynge

                      fayth from consentynge to the seruyce of synne, and fro the malyciouse castynge of / of the yoke of goddes commaūdementes from hys necke: it appereth wery well that of hys necke was it ones, whyther hym selfe caste it of, or Bethsabe toke it of bycause he shulde not come yoked to bedde.

this my worde in ye syght of all Israell & this sonne.
                  
                  Lo good reders, here se ye very clere, that where as Tyndale sayth that Dauid in all those horryble dedes dyd yet no dedely synne, bycause he sayeth he consented not to synne, nor dyde none of these dedes wyllyngly, nor cast not of the yoke of loue towarde the lawe of god / god here sayth that Dauyd dyd in those horryble dedes dyspyce bothe his lawe and hym selfe to. And how dyd he then kepe styll his loue to the lawe of god, in the whyle in whyche he dyspysed both the lawe of god and god hym selfe also? Or how sayth Tyndale that Dauyd cōsented not to the synne, when god hym selfe that beste knewe hys thoughte layed hys synnes so sore to hys charge, that he appoynted an endeles plage for the punisshement therof? tyll by hys repentaunce & his humble confessyon, god as he forgaue the dedelynesse of  the synne, and translated it from mortall in to venyall, so chaunged the punysshemente from endeles in to endynge.
                  For where as the prophete, had before hys repentaunce and confessyon sayed vnto hym by the byddynge of god, The plage shall abyde in thyne howse for euer world with ende / forthwyth after hys repentaunce and hys confessyon made, he sayed vnto hym, Our lorde hath translated thy synne that was, from dedely to venyall / that is to wytte the punysshement from eternall to temporall. And therfore the prophete sayed, that yet the chylde that he bygatte vppon her in that auoutry, sholde dye as it dyde after in dede. And yet was not Dauyd out of hope wyth other penaunce (whyche he hadde leuer sustayne) to purge and redeme ye punisshement to / and therfore fasted and prayed to saue the  chylde, vntyll the tyme that it was dede in dede.
                  And thus good chrysten reders ye maye clerely se, that all Tyndals proper processe of kynge Dauyd, concernyng the order of hys eleccyon, that he was therby preserued for euer frome all dedely synne, ys clerely comen to noughte / and all hys wordes reproued by the very playne wordes of scrypture. And yet by the same scrypture for aduauntage, is there a nother of Tyndals heresy destroyed / by whyche he teacheth that after repentaunce all is forthwyth forgyuen vnto the electe, bothe synne and payne and all / so farre fo

                     th that for the synne passed, the partye shall neuer after be punusshed nor suffer any payne, neyther in thys world; purgatory, nor any where ellys. The playne reprofe wherof

                      of appereth euydentely / the dedely synne translated, and y• temporall punysshemente reserued by thys open place of scrypture. By whyche is reproued Tyndales other heresye that we now go aboute / in whyche he techeth vs that Dauyd dyd none of hys horryble dedes wyllyngly, nor consented to synne, nor malycyously caste of the yoke of loue towarde the lawe of god, and therfore synned not dedely. wherin as ye se agaynste Tyndale tellynge vs thys / very god hym selfe telleth vs the contrary / and that Dauyd synned so dedely, that he synfully despysed bothe goddes lawe and god hym selfe therwyth.
                  And now that Tyndale hath of kyng Dauyd tolde vs hys wyse processe of not synnynge, suche as ye se it proued / he procedeth forth from Dauyd, and telleth vs as wyse a  tale of Chrystes blessed apostles. Of whom thus he sayth.

The swerde of temptacyons, with feare, sorowe, mornynge, and wepynge, had so depely perced theyr hartes, and the cruell syghte had so cumbered theyr myndes / that they coulde not byleue vntyll Chryste hym selfe came, deth put of and ouercome

                  For hys purpose is to proue vs that none electe can at any tyme synne dedely. And now forgetteth he that poynt, & telleth vs that the apostles neuer loste theyr fayth. which yf it were graunted hym, yet wanne he not hys purpose. For they myghte kepe styll the fayth in theyr harte,

Shewynge by those wordes, that neyther are we ryghtuouse by sayeng wyth our mouth that we do byleue, but yf we byleue in our harte / nor shal be saued by the bylyefe of our harte, but yf no fere can let vs to cōfesse it with our mouth. wherto consenten the wordes of our sauyour hym selfe,
                        Matth. 10.
                      where he sayth, who so denye me before men, I shall deny hym to before my father, whyche is in heuen. And thus for the fyrste poynt Tyndale in hys holy sermon is so depe in deuocyō, yt he forgetteth where about he goth.
                  Now for the seconde poynt, where I sayed no more but that they loste the suffycyent fayth, that is to saye the lyfe of theyr fayth / he goth about as I tolde you, to proue vs that the apostles suche as were electe neuer loste theyr fayth at  all, nor at any tyme fell therfro. And thys poynt handeleth he so properly, that euer he telleth vs that they loste it not, and euer he proueth vs that they loste it. And by the selfe same wordes by whyche he sayeth that they kepe it alwaye styll, by the selfe same I say alwaye styll he proueth yt they kepte it not styll in dede, but were very farre fallen therfro.
                  For fyrst rede me all those wordes of hys agayn / and as gayly as they be cowched, wyth astonyed, and amased, & stormy temptacyons, terryble syghtes wyth theyr hartes perced, and theyr myndes cumbred, with syght of his deth, and fere of theyr owne, that ere they coulde byleue hys resurreccyon, he was fayne to eate and drynke wyth them & to lette them fele hym / is not all thys tale excuses of theyr

                      faythe fallen from them, and no profe of the kepyng? what was that in them, but the lacke & losse of the faythe yt Tyndale telleth vs, that they thoughte it impossyble that he shulde ryse agayne, bycause they thought he coulde neuer of his owne power, and coulde nat thynke or deuyse who shulde rayse hym elles?
                  Nowe where he sayeth that all this happed theym thorowe tēptacyon / that wyll we well agre. But yet is that no more to saye, but lyke as Dauid dyd auoutrye thorowe temptacyon, and kylled his good frende thorowe temptacyon / and as Eue ete the forbeden frute thorowe temptacyon, and Adam ete hit also thorowe temptacyon / and Iudas bytrayed Chryste also thorow temptacyon: so thapostels fell from theyr faythe, and l

                  But the synne of men standeth in thys, that they breke the commaundement of god, in that they do nat as he byddeth them, stryue and resyste the temptacyon. whyche tyll they cease to do, if they truste in god and call helpe of hys grace / there can no temptacyon be so great that it can ouer come them / as wytnesseth our lorde by the mouthe of saynt Poule: God is faythefull,

                      whiche suffreth you nat to be tempted aboue that ye may bere / but gyueth with y• temptacyon awaye out that ye may well wyelde it.
                  But let Tyndale say for excuse of their synne what him lyste / whyche thoughe thoccasyons and circumstaunces  may minysshe or aggreue, and so may theyrs be lesse greuous than the synnes of some other / and the synne of some one of thē selfe also lesse than another of his owne felowes: yet shall Tyndale neuer make it good, but that whan he sayeth they coulde nat beleue, if he saye true, the lacke of theyr belefe was a greuons synne.
                  For where as Tyndale wolde seme to saye well for the apostels, in that he sayeth they wold fayne haue dyed with our sauyour, sauynge for the feare of theyr owne dethe: Christe had before forbyden them suche feare of temporall dethe vpon the payne of eternall dethe, whan he sayd vnto them, feare ye nat them that kyll the body / whiche whanne they haue kylled the body haue nothynge that they can do more. But I shall shewe you whom you shall feare. Feare

you hym whiche whan he hathe kylled the body, hathe the  power to caste the soule into the fyre of hell. And in another place he tolde them accordyng to the same, who so will saue hys soule in this worlde,
                        Iohā. 12
                      shall lese it / And who so shal lese hys soule in thys worlde, kepeth it styll for the euerlastynge lyfe. And fynally to shewe theym that all these wordes moost proprely perteyned to the puttynge away of that fere of dethe, by whiche folke for feare of dethe wolde forbere and refuse to dye for hym and his faythe: he

                      I shall denye him also before my father whiche is in heuen.
                  And therfore Tyndale in vayne goeth about to excuse the synne of Christes apostels, which they rather will haue knowen, and the great mercy of god therwith / and therfore  they wryte it them selfe. & the rebukes therewith that our sauyour gaue them therfore / to thende that we shulde bothe beware of fallynge in the lyke, and yet if it in oure owne defaute misfortune vs to fall, nat dispayre therfore, but repent and aryse with goddes helpe as they dyd / and than shall he forgyue vs as he forgaue theym. And thys wolde rather Christes blessed apostels y• Tyndale shulde tell vs truthe, than vnder pretexte of theyr excuse, teche vs false heresyes / and make vs wene that vpon temptacyon to forsake our sauyour for feare of temporall dethe, were no dedely synne. wherof oure sauyoure hym selfe as ye se techeth vs playne the contrary / and wyll nat admytte for vs I feare me, the excuse of Tyndale for thapostles, if we come and say, By my faythe good lorde I was a ferde and  so forgate all that euer thou taughtest me.
                  Howe be it that they synne nat in lesyng of theyr fayth, I lette no man to beleue Tyndale, whan sa euer he proue hym selfe more credyble than Christe. But here ye se that as I tolde you that they loste theyr faythe in dede / Tyndale proueth vs after his maner in his fore rehersed wordes, wherein he sayeth nay.
                  And yet is the man of so good remembraunce, and so good hede taketh where aboute he goeth, that forthwith in his nexte wordes after he sayeth very playnly more and more, that they coulde nat beleue the resurrection / and excuseth them thus, that for all that they hated hym nat in theyr harte. Lo thus he sayeth.

                     Howe be it there was none of theym that was fallen in hys harte frome Christe.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  who can more plainly say that they were fallen from the faythe and lacked the belefe, than Tyndale sayeth here? For thoughe he sayeth that none of them was in his harte fallen from Christ / yet he sayeth they coulde nat beleue the substancyall artycle of the fayth of Christ, that is to wytte the belefe of his resurreccion / without the belefe wherof all the remanaunt wolde nat than serue them to saluacyon.
                  And that they beleued nat that artycle, Tyndale here sayeth expressely. For he sayeth that thoughe they ran to the sepulchre, and wolde fayne haue beleued that he was  rysen / yet they coulde nat beleue it / the wounde of theyr temptacyon was so greate, that they coulde nat beleue it at the prechynge of a woman, without any other myracle. Than aske I no more but thys tale of Tyndale. For if they coulde
                        •
                      nat beleue, than dyd they nat beleue / and so lacked they than the belefe. For as for that they came therto agayne, and that Iosephe of Arimath

                      and that hys two discyples towarde Emaus burned in theyr brestes to here speke of hym: all this maketh to Tyndales purpose in this poynte nat the value of a poyntes ende. For we speke of his apostels, in the tyme in whiche him selfe sayeth here they beleued nat, nor coulde beleue it. At that tyme say I, y• syth they than beleued nat,  as they dyd nat if they coulde nat, they than had for that whyle the lacke of the faythe.
                  And also to what purpose telleth Tyndale vs, that they coulde nat beleue at the bare prechynge of the woman? As thoughe they were nothynge to blame for that, bycause they were but women / whan the apostels them selfe kn
                        •
                     we these women for suche, as they were worthy more credence some one of them than some many men.
                  And for to excuse the apostels in the lacke of belefe, bycause the messyngers were but women / Tyndale dothe therein no more but lay lacke and ouersyght in oure sauyour, that in a thynge that he wolde haue beleued, sent out suche women on his myssage.
                  But Tyndale woteth well if he beleue the gospell, that

no more they dyd whan they sawe the myracle of hym selfe  commyng in before them the dores beynge shette, and spekynge vnto them / but were so farre fro the belefe of his resurreccion at the fyrste, that they had went that he had ben some spirite, tyll he nat onely preched to them, but also reasoned with them there vpon.
                  Nor yet saynte Thomas, whiche as Tyndale sayeth coulde nat beleue tyll he sawe Chryste / neyther dyd beleue the woman nor all his awne felowes, nor our sauyour him selfe vpon the syght neyther, tyll he felt him fully, and put hys fynger in his syde. And this he dyd of stoberne standynge in his mysse belefe / in that after his belefe lackinge, he went nat about to seke the truthe, and endeuoure hym selfe to beleue them that tolde him the trouthe / but as it semeth by the gospell, obstinately stode in his distruste, and  sayd tyll he dyd (that he thought of lykelyhede he neuer shuld) that is to wytte tyll he felte hym and put his fynger into his woundes, he wolde neuer beleue it.
                  And I saye plainly, who so euer beynge enfourmed of any artycle of the faythe whiche god byndeth vs to beleue, beleueth it nat / the cause why he beleueth nat is nat bycause he can nat, but bycause he wyll nat. For if he wolde do the thynge whiche Tyndale taketh for foly, that is to wytte nat resyste but endeuour hym selfe to submytte hys reason vnto faythe, with askynge helpe of god for the fortheraunce of his imperfeccion / he thus doynge hys parte, god wolde I say nat fayle on his parte agayne, but wolde effectually worke with hym to perfyte in hym the faythe in whyche he preuenteth hym by g

                      of loue toward the law of god. And yet perceyuynge y• that steppe wyll not holde hym neyther / he cometh at laste vnto a nother steppe, and sayth he casteth it not of malycyously / trustynge bycause we can not loke into the mannes breste, to se whyther he bare any malyce therin, we shold neuer be able to conuycte hym of that worde, when he put on ys ther to malycyously. And yet from ye steppe haue I dreuen hym / & therin haue I begyled his hope, as ye before haue herde in the synnes of king Dauid, by the wordes of god spoken by the mouth of Nathan the prophete.
                  Now as he played there / so playeth he by the apostles here. For fyrste he sayth they lost neuer the fayth, bycause they were amased, & then astonyed, and then aferde, & th

And yet wolde he now make vs wene, that though they byleued not, yet had they no lacke of the fayth / bycause in the lacke of theyr bylyefe they hadde no malice.

                     nteth alwaye, and kepeth & preserueth the electes from fallynge into ye case.
                  
                     Here is a goodly tale be ye sure. But now wherby shall  Tyndale of thys doctryne make vs sure?
                  The gospell to begynne wyth for one pece, maketh vs sure of the contrary.
                  For therin we fynde that the traytoure Iudas, whyche was I wene as farre from the bylyefe of the resurreccyon as euer was saynt Thomas of Inde / came neuer yet vnto suche raylynge and blasphemynge of Chryst / as Tyndale sayth that the apostles bycause they byleued not, had they not ben by grace preuented, must nedes haue comen vnto.
                  For when he went about to make his bargayn, & bytray hym and sell hym / we fynde not that he called hym false wretche, nor no suche vylanouse word. And after we fynde that when he repented and brought agayne the money, he was farre from raylynge vppon hym, and sayed I haue  offended god in bytrayenge the ryghtuouse blode. And surely though he had at the sellyng rayled as mych vpon him toward hys passyō, as Tyndale in hys bokes now rayleth & iesteth vpon hym in the blessed sacrament after hys resurreccyon: yet dare I be bolde vpon hys mercy to say, that yf that olde Iudas in his repentaūce, had with the loking vppon hys own synne loked also vpō the great mercy of god / and also that yf Tyndale now thys new Iudas wyll repēt hys raylynge agaynst Chrystes blessed body the sacramēt of the awlter, & aske our lord mercy therfore: both the tone sholde haue had, & the tother shall haue, remyssyon and forgyuenes of that dedely synne wyth chaūge of hell into purgatory / into whych the tone in vayne now fayne wold, and the tother except he mende herafter shall as mych in vayne  wysshe to come.
                  Now Tyndale wyll peraduenture stycke vppon some sotle coniecture of hys owne and styffely bere vs in hande, that though it be not wryten in the gospell, yet dyd Iudas when he solde Chryste, speke of hym some blasphemouse wordes, & had opprobrouse lauguage agaynste hym / and that the blasphemy therof was the very cause why that he coulde neuer after by any repentaunce be forgyuen hys synne, and receyued agayne to grace.
                  If Tyndale thus tell vs, and wyll wene by thys waye to wynde out / we wyll for thys ones forgette to putte hym in mynde of hys owne rule, that we nede not byleue hym forther then he fyndeth in playne and euydent scrypture.

                      But we wyll tell hym then, that there is as great lyklyhed and somdele more to, that saynte Poule when after the resurreccyon of Chryste, and the stonyng of saynt Stephen,

                     nd blaspheme the name of Chryste, and hys doctryne, and myracles, and all that he taughte and dyd. And yet for all thys was he receyued after to grace & forgyuenesse / & was after elected, ye and for the foresyghte of his repentaunce, chaunge, and penaunce, was a chosen vessell before god byfore the worlde was made / and hadde ones the ryghte bylyefe of lykelyhed, as myche as he was bounden to before the gospell preched, and then stode in state of grace / and yet was suffered thorow his owne fawte to fall therfro, by refusynge the gospell of Chryste, and after fell  in hatynge and persecutynge of hys name and doctryne / and not as it semeth wythout blasphemynge of hys name, his lyuynge, hys deth, hys doctryne, and his resurreccyon, and all that euer he dyd / and yet by repentaunce and penaunce receyued to fayth and to forgyuenesse agayne. And therfore nedeth not Tyndale to dyspayre, but that as euyll as he is, he maye yet repente and be forgyuen yf he wyll.
                  But by thys one ensāple of saynt Poule, are in ye meane whyle vtterly destroyed, not onely Tyndals wordes laste aboue rehersed / but ouer ye all this his hole chapyter of the order of our eleccyon / wherof the hole purpose is in effecte, that god kepeth them euer from all dedely synne.
                  And thus good reders ye se how well he defendeth the  apostles fayth, whyche he sayth they neuer lost at no tyme / and yet confesseth hym selfe that at one tyme they neyther byleued nor coude byleue. And yet whyle they byleued not, they lost not theyr bylyefe bycause they rayleth not / and bycause that after they came agayne to bylyefe, therfore they lacked it not at any tyme before it came.
                  Is not here good reders a wyse and well tolde tale? It is inough for me, that how so euer Tyndale excuse theyr mystruste and vnbylyefe / I se them selfe wryte, that our sauyour him selfe accused it,
                        Maici. 16
                      and rebuked thē sore of theyr incredulyte and harde harte, for that they had not byleued them that they hadde sene hym ryse. And now that Tyndale hath so wysely defended them all / he cometh partycalarly to saynt Peter and sayth.
               
               
                  
                  Tyndale.
                  
                  
                     Ye and Peter as soone as he had denyed Chryste / came to hym selfe immedyately, and went out and wepte bytterly for sorowe. And thus we se that Peters fayth fayled not, though it were oppressed for a tyme.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Tyndale euer laboreth to lede vs a myle fro the mater. For well ye wote the chyrche techeth not, nor no man was there euer any where so madde to saye, that the chosen and electes do dye in dedely synne / but that they somtyme do dedely synnes / that is to wytte, such synnes as yf they dyed in them wythout repentaūce of them, they sholde be dampned for them.
                  Agaynste thys doctryne of the catholyke chyrch / taketh Tyndale in hande to proue vs, as well by dyuers other tytles of thys boke, and by hys exposycyon vppon the fyrste  pystle of saynt Iohn̄, as by all the processe of thys hys present chapyter of the order of theyr eleccyon / that the electes neuer do no dedely synnes. That is ye wote well as myche to say, as that they do no suche synnes / whych done in such maner as they do them, be of theyr nature dedely / that is to saye suche as yf the person that doth them dye before he repent them, he sholde be dampned for them.
                  Now good chrysten reders the poynte consydered that is in debate bytwene vs / ye perceyue very well that eyther muste Tyndale take and vnderstande dedely synne, for some other thynge and in some other maner then all other men do, and otherwyse then it is taken and vnderstanden by ye catholyke chyrch of Chryst agaynste which he dysputeth / whych maner of hys dysputacyō yf he otherwyse toke  it then hys aduersaryes do, were on hys parte to shamefull and folysshe, as euery man well seeth y• any lernyng hath / for then dysputed he but vppon the worde and not vppon the mater, whyche he wyll not I wene for very shame be so madde to do: or ellys yf he take I saye thys worde dedely synne as in dede he must nedes do, thā do you good reders I dowt

                  For Tyndale yf he wyll proue that he dyd therin no dedely

                  This shulde he proue vs ye wote well / & this ye se well he dissembleth. And to proue that saynte Peter synned nat dedely before / he telleth vs that he repented after. whyche is the very thynge wherby it is declared in holy scrypture, that his synne was greuous. For what was the thinge he so repented / but the synne of his denyenge. And therfore ye more sorowfully that he repented it, the more bytterly that  he be wepte and bewayled it, the more payne that he toke for it / the more hym selfe sheweth vs the sore offence a

                     d heynous dedelynes therof.
                  And nowe commeth Tyndale on the tother syde / and by the selfe same sorowe, wolde make men wene it was no dedely synne / by whyche it specially dothe appere the contrarye.
                  And than thus handelynge the matter, he is nat ashamed to tell vs in conclusyon, that we nowe se by this wyse reason, that saynt Peter his faythe fayled nat. whereof he hathe as ye se proued vs nothynge / but hathe hym selfe tolde vs by playne expresse wordes the contrarye, whan he tolde vs that thapostles coulde nat for all ye womens wordes, beleue that Christ was rysen / nor well in a good while  after, at the syght of our sauyour hym selfe.
                  Howe be it all thys he sayeth was no faylynge of Peters faythe, but an oppressynge for the whyle / as thoughe I or any man elles had any tyme sayde that Peters fayth feyled for euer.
                  I say that it fayled for the whyle, not for euer. And yet sayd I no ferther in my dialoge therof, but that his liuely faythe fayled for ye whyle, bycause it wrought nat by loue. But if his belefe stode styll / it was a bare belefe, barayne of the frute of charyte / with whiche it wroughte nat in the harte, whan it brought nat forthe the confessyon of Christe by the mouthe.
                  But mary Tindale hath sayd yet more / and hath taken away from hym boldely bothe quicke fayth and dede faith

and all as for the whyle.
                  
                  In whyche poynt whan Tyndale hath all done / he can neuer whyle he lyueth auoyde it, but that in sayenge that there was a tyme in whyche the apostels coulde nat byleue that Christe was arysen agayne, he is agreed with vs as for the matter. For in those wordes he confesseth, that in that tyme theyr faythe was fallen from them. But he stryueth styll with vs vpon the worde, & wyll in no wyse haue that fall called faylynge, but amasyng and astonyenge vpon great occasyons, & with the great burden oppressynge.
                  well than sythe we be metely well agreed together, Tyndale and I in the matter / we wyll for thys ones no lenger debate about a worde, and styll dyspute all daye, whether fallynge may be called fayling. But I am content to gyue it ouer, and lette Tyndale haue hys wyll, & abyde thereby  styll / that thoughe saynt Peter dyd fall and his faythe to, yet shall nat Tyndale be bounden to call that fallyng faylynge / but amasynge yf he lyste, or estonyenge vpon great occasyons and by sore burden oppressynge.
                  And in lyke wyse am I content, that yf vpon great occasyon of a longe wery way, with a depe myre and a great blocke in the botome, Tyndals horse happen vnder hym fyrste to snappre and stumble, and after that faynt and fall downe in the myre and tumble, and his mayster & he there lye to gether and iumble, tyll some good felowe helpe them vppe and brynge them to an inne, where they tary together tyll the horse be with mete and reste better growen in hart: let Tyndall for me whan he rydeth agayne, call his fall no faylynge nor no fallynge neyther. But yet shall he neuer  let other men to call it as it is.
                  Nowe Tyndale yet after hys fowle falle, dissymulyng hys ouerthrowe as thoughe no man sawe it / ryally tryumpheth and bosteth in this matter, that he hathe in hys chapyter of the ordre of eleccion, so wel and wysely quytte him selfe so lyke a pretye man. For ioye and glorye whereof, he fynyssheth hys chapyter with a pleasaunte proper taunt, wherin he taunteth me.

And yet if he loste y• belefe therof, it may be called styll his / vnderstandynge by that spekynge, that he fyrste confessed it. And therfore in

good faythe I can nat well se, wherfore we may nat saye  saynt Peters faythe was in our lady, as well as we maye say wyclyffes heresyes are in Tyndall.
                  And therfore, where for the saltynge and seasonynge of his vnsauery scoffe, he chaungeth and mysse reherseth my wordes, and the very wordes of Chrystes gospell to / and hathe a pleasure to playe betwene our lady and saynte Peter, and to tosse the faythe lyke a tenys ball frome the tone to the tother, with fonde wordes of hys owne folisshe framynge, nothynge nere to the matter whan the place in my dyaloge shalbe as it shall ones be by goddes grace, surely sene and examyned: I truste to make you than se, that all his propre sportynge wherin he playeth his pageaunte betwene saynt Peter and our lady, may for any wyt hit hathe, serue hym for a pastyme, if he satte saddely by  frantycke Colyns and pyked rysshes in Betheleem.

                     te wyse some glose there nedeth. And than dare I be bolde to say, that if there any nede / the glose thā that he mocketh let him reherse it right, is suche as he wyll nat thys fyue yere fynde a better.
                  But leauynge that glose as I say, tyll I come to my  dyaloge: yet to se in the meane whyle whether any glose neded or none, syth Tyndale agreeth that there neded if y• faythe at any tyme fayled in saynt Peter / I shall nat lette for his pleasure ones agayne to serche, whether the faythe at any tyme fayled in saynt Peter or no.
                  And to thentent that we may deale well and playnly to gether / let hym & me fyrste agre to gether, what the thinge is whervpon we dispute. For he vseth often whan he is conuycted, to say that he toke thys worde or that worde otherwyse than we take hym therein.
                  Let vs therfore fyrste, bycause we speke of faythe, here hym declare what hym selfe calleth faythe.
                  To thys after that he sawe hym selfe shamefully confuted,

                      concernynge hys heresye of fayth alone suffycyent for saluacyon / he sayth that he calleth not a dede fayth any fayth / but he meaneth all waye by fayth, a very chrysten fayth that hath the loue therwyth, by reason wherof it can not but worke well.
                  Now shall ye se how courteysely that I shall handle Tyndale. For all be it ye se well that I myghte by many meanes and many playne authorytees,
                        Iacobi. 2.

                      yet shall I for hys pleasure lette all that passe for thys tyme,
                        Matth. 2
                              •
                           .
                      and take fayth as he sayth he taketh it hym selfe.
                  But then aske I Tyndale thys tyme, whyther that in the tyme in whyche Peter forsoke and forswore Chryst,  he dyd byleue wyth suche a bylyefe, that then wroughte well wyth loue. If he saye ye / then syth the worke that he then wroughte was the forsakynge and forswerynge of Chryste, it muste nedes folowe that he sayth, that the forsakynge and forswerynge of Chryste was a good worke. And then wyll it theruppon folow, that syth saynte Peter wepte sorowfully therfore, he was vere sory and sore repented hym that he hadde well wroughte wyth loue, and done a good worke. So that I se no remedy, but that Tyndale muste nedes, be he neuer so loth, confesse and graunth vs, that saynt Peter in that tyme dyd not byleue wyth loue y• wrought well.
                  Now thynketh me than that bytwene Tyndale and me there lacketh now but one thynge / and that is what we call  faylynge. For the better perceyuynge wherof I wyll aske Tyndale thys.
                  If saynt Peter had holde on styll in that forsakyng and that periury styll all hys lyfe, & so fynally dyed therin, and had yet for all that all the whyle byleued in hys herte all the artycles of ye trew fayth, & the cōtrary of all yt he sayd, & not onely rayled no thyng all ye whyle agaynst Chryst, but also loued hym to, sauyng not so well but yt he wold rather forswere yt euer he sawe hym, then to suffer payne & sorow for hym: I aske I say of Tyndale, yf saynt Peter had contynued his lyfe & dyed in this state, had not then at no tyme in his lyfe his fayth yt Tindale calleth fayth, yt is to say his bylefe with well workyng loue fayled hym? yf he say no / thē wyll it folow vpō Tindals word, yt there may be many

                  The moste parte I suppose that of the chrysten people shall be dampned / the cause of theyr dampnacyon shall be, that where as they byleue ryght and loue god also, so farre forth as he wyll let them liue as they lyst and make mery, and bynde theym to nothynge that they haue no lust to do / loue hym not yet so suffycyentely, as for the loue that they bere hym, they wyll rather forbere the pleasours of theyr lyfe / and also rather dye then dedely to dysplease hym, by the doynge of any suche thynge as he wyll rather that they shall dye then do it.
                  
                  Now se I therfore no remedy, but that Tyndale muste nedes agre, that yf saynt Peter had in such state lyued and dyed / hys fayth well workynge by loue had fayled hym.
                  Then syth it hadde then in sometyme at the leste wyse fayled hym / lette vs deuyde that tyme of that state of hys from hys fyrste denye

                      Now aske I Tyndale whether y• not faylynge of his fayth now in the latter partes of hys tyme, yt is to wyt in D & E / doth now make it trewe that hys fayth fayleth hym not before, whyle it fayled hym in dede in the thre formar tymes ABC the thre partes of hys hole tyme ABCDE.
                  Now what Tyndale must nedes answere vnto thys, he can tell well inough I warraunt, when he loketh in hys carde vpon those letters in hys crosse rowe. For there he muste nedes se, that though hys fayth fayleth neuer after whyle it fayled not / yet before whyle it fayled, it

                  Now yf Tyndale wolde wynk at these letters lyke a wanton ladde that no man coulde make hym loke vp: yet  shall I shew you that he hath redde them all redy, & spyed full well that Peter synned dedely / & lyke a shrewed wyly lad hath scraped it out of hys boke.
                  For ye wote well that in those wordes of our sauyoure vnto saynt Peter, he sayth vnto hym: And thou after that thou shalt be conuerted, conferme thou and make stronge thy bretherne.

               Fyrste he tolde vs in the begynnynge, that thys worde churche hathe dyuers significacyons / amonge whyche at laste he bethought him vpon twayne. One a generall significacyons, by whiche it is taken for all that embrace the name of Chryste, though

                   and whervpon all the matter moste especially dependeth / that is to wytte the catholyke church of Christ of all trewe christen people.

               More ouer, sythe he bryngeth forthe that chapyter, for the profe that the onely electes be the churche, for there about goeth all his matter / and well ye wote the worde of god bothe wrytten and vnwrytten, may be and is beleued bothe of the electes and of the nat elected: therfore is also that chapyter nothynge at all to purpose.
               Fynally syth he speketh of the lawe wrytten by the spyryte of god in the harte / nowe sythe that lawe so wrytten there, is rather y• worde of god vnwrytten, than his worde wrytten in the bokes of the scrypture that we haue / of whiche wordes onely, Tyndale maketh all his matter, and abhorreth euery worde that god wolde eyther speke or wryte besyde the scrypture that we haue all redy: this chapyter  of Tyndals nat onely nothynge maketh for his purpose, but also rather semeth greatly to make agaynste it.

                  rayned of our euangelycall lybertie / he bethynketh hym selfe better / and in hys other chapyter after he techeth vs that we be nat of necessytie bounden to beleue all that neyther / but so that we beleue the promyses, we may be saued well inoughe he sayeth, beleuynge nat other thynges wrytten euen in the very gospell it selfe.
               
                  
                   This is hys doctryne in his chapyter / where he techeth vs that the churche may erre and that yet it can nat erre / sauynge that sodeynly vnware he confesseth euen there the contrary.
               Thanne commeth he forthe in hys chapyter with thys questyon, whether the churche can erre or nat. And there he fyrste sayeth, that thys comen knowen catholyke churche bothe may erre and dothe erre / and proueth it by hys bare worde. And than he sheweth what hym selfe calleth the electe church / and sayeth that it is the whole multytude of all repentynge synners that beleue in Chryste, and put all theyr truste and confydence in the mercy of god / felyng in theyr hartes that god for Christes sake loueth them, and wyll be or rather is mercyfull vnto theym, and forgyueth  theyr synnes of whyche they repente, and all the mocyons vnto synne, of whiche they feare that they shalbe drawen into synne agayne / and this they beleue and fele withoute any respecte of their owne deseruynge and onely for the respecte of goddes trouthe and promyse.
               Than goeth he forthe, and bosteth hyghly thys maner of felynge faythe that is heresyes in stede of faythe, as I haue in myne answere proued / and therein he spendeth vp that chapyter.
               But yet thoughe he thus descrybe the electe churche: yet dothe he nat proue that this is the churche whyche we muste here and obeye. For god hathe commaunded vs to complayne to the churche, and here the churche, and obey the churche. And therfore though we agreed euery thyng  that he sayeth in his chapyter / he had yet sythe his electes are vnknowen, proued thereby no pece of hys pryncypall purpose, that is to wytte whiche is the churche.
               Also where hys tytle of that chapyter is, whyther the chyrche maye erre: Tyndale sayenge that the catholyke chyrche maye erre / whyther the electe chyrche whyche hym selfe taketh for the chyrche maye erre or not, he sayth not in all that chapyter any one worde. And so is hys chapyter neyther any thynge towarde hys pryncypall purpose / nor yet, whyche is more shame for hym, any thynge conteyneth in it belongynge to the mater of the tytle.
               Then cometh he forth wyth hys other chapyter that a trewe member of Chrystes chyrche synneth not, and is yet

for all that a synner. whiche chapiter besydes that it is but  a fonde rydle, with nothynge but a hepe of folysshe heresyes as I haue proued: yet is it also towarde the mater, that is to wytte whiche is the churche, nothyng to the purpose at all / for as moche as thoughe he sayeth that they can do no dedely synne, yet he confesseth that they may do suche horryble dedes as muste nedes make them be taken for the chyldren of the deuyll.
               After commeth his other goodly rydle, that a chrysten man can nat erre and howe he may yet erre. And therein he telleth vs as I haue before shewed you, yt the electes can nat erre in ye promyses of god / & as for all other errours, none can (he sayeth) be dampnable to theym, thoughe the contrary of theyr errour be wrytten in the very gospell.
               By whiche doctryne of hys ye may se, that errours of  doctryne in maner of liuynge Tyndale taketh for a small matter, bycause they be no promyses of god. And therfore is Tyndale nat greatly to be beleued, whan he techeth vs that freres may wedde nonnes / bicause it is no promyse of god, but a promyse of the frere to the nonne, & of y• nonne to the frere, eche of them wedded and bedded with other, and bothe twayne wedded and bedded with the deuyll.
               yet ye se well that thys chapyter yf it were all as trew
                     •
                   as it is all false / proueth yet no thynge whyche is the chyrche. where as he sholde fayste haue proued that the electes onely be the chyrch, and then after serche whyther they can erre or not.
               Then cometh he forth wyth hys other chapyter
                     •
                   that the fayth whyche he hath before descrybed, is euer foughten  wythall. But in y• electes it is in suche wyse inexpugnable, y• whē they ones haue it, it cā neuer at any tyme after fayle.
               Now this great conclusyon wherof he maketh this chapyter is such, that as ye se well therupon dependeth many greate maters. yet doth he not in all thys chapyter brynge forth any maner thynge for the profe, eyther reason, scrypture, or other authoryte / but onely by hys owne bare word, telleth vs that it is so. Now yf he tolde vs a thynge well knowen or comenly byleued, I sholde not blame hym. But now to tell vs suche a thynge so straunge, and vnto euery man saue hym selfe so inopynable, & such as no man wold wene were lykely to be trew, & byd vs so boldely byleue it,

                   and saue his owne bare wurshypfull word tell vs no cause why: it is eyther a poynt of a man more authorysed then an apostle, or ellys lesse wytted then a very fole.
               Fynally cometh he forth at laste wyth hys chapyter, of whyche he calleth the maner & order of our eleccyon.
               Therin he telleth vs concernynge electes, and y• order of theyr chosyng, that god doth fyrste chose them, and after calleth them, & techeth them, & maketh theym se theyr dāpnacyon in the lawe & mercy layed vp for them in hym, and what he wyll haue them do. And thē they chose god agayn & submytte them selfe to hys lawes to walke in them. And that thynge he sayth the man doth of necessyte, bycause his wyll can do none other / but hys wytte muste nedes se the thynges that god maketh hym se, & his wyll muste nedes  agre to folow so the thynge that hys wytte s
                     •
                  eth.
               Then he telleth vs that the mercy of god allwaye wayteth vpon the electe / by reason wherof he can neuer so fall, but yt he shall ryse agayne. But yet he sheweth vs forther, that for all thys the electe synketh downe somtyme, & 
                     •
                  alleth into traunces and slepes, by whyche he forgeteth hym selfe, and then doth dyuers horryble & abomynable dedes in hys slepe. But yet in all hys horryble dedes he doth no dedely synne, bycause he doth them all of fraylte and infyrmyte, and none of them of purpose or wyllyngly. For wyllyngly can he not do them, bycause he lyeth a slepe / nor in all y• whyle hys fayth neuer fayleth at any tyme. And thys he proueth vs by thensamples of kynge Dauyd, and saynt Peter, and saynt Thomas of Inde, and the other apostles.  For there was he sayth none of these that in all y• euer we rede in the scrypture reproued in theyr dedes, as aduoutry manslaughter, not byleuyn

               And here is all Tyndals hole tale, that he hath from the begynnynge hytherto tolde vs / wherby we sholde lerne of hym whyche is the chyrche, and whyther the chyrche maye erre or not. In all whych who so loke it thorow & myne answere therwith / shall well perceyue y• he hath not in all his hole processe halfe a lefe to gyther nor almost halfe a lyne, without one great foly at y• lest, or els a lye and an halfe.
               
                  Consyder nowe that of hys electes, whyche is of hys  wordes mych a do to perceyue, they be so darke and so intryked of purpose wythout any dependence or order / yet in the ende when all is gathered to gyd

                  r and aduysed well, thys is the hole somme, that god choseth a certayne whom he lyketh. And when he choseth them Tyndale telleth not, whyther before the worlde made, or after them selfe borne. But vnto them he sendeth forth, & calleth them, & theym he gyueth a felynge fayth, wherby they fele surely that they shall be saued, wythout any regarde of good workes / and then they chose hym agayne, & agre to walke in his lawes. But before theyr felyng fayth had, they neuer ones thynke vppon hym.
               For as for any endeuour of theym selfe at goddes good mocyon towarde the fayth, they do no more he sayth then  doth the chylde towarde the gettynge of hys owne father. And hys mercy wayteth euer vppon them. And theyr fayth doth neuer at any tyme fayle them / nor they do neuer sinne dedely, what horryble & abominable

               And syth these folke that are Tyndals electes, haue or wene they haue, suche a felynge fayth, that therby they fele or ellys wene they fele that they can not be dampned / but haue here lerned of Tyndale now, that what horryble dedes so euer they do, they can neuer do dadely synne / and be also very sure to repente, and the

For syth theyr fayth is both full of false heresyes, & also can neuer fayle them / they may make them selfe sure you se well, that they shall be no worse parde, not when they be at the very wurste, then faythfull harlottes, faythfull auo

               And these be as ye se nowe Tyndalys specyall electes / whyche onely nomber by hys hygh spyrytuall doctryne, he wolde we sholde take for the chyrche.
               Now good Chrysten reders yf we wolde graunte vnto

Of whyche so declared as they be, neyther nother is suffycyent for hys purpose / and yet the secunde mych lesse then the fyrste.
               For where as in the fyrste he defyneth it to be onely the electys, in whose hartes god hath wryten hys lawe wyth hys holy spyryte, and gyuen them a felynge fayth of the mercy that is in Chryste Iesu our lorde: afterwarde in the secunde he sayth that it is the hole multytude of all repentynge synners, that byleue in Chryst, and put all theyr  truste and confydence in the mercy of god / felynge in theyr hartes that god for Chrystes sake loueth them, and wyll be or rather is, mercyfull vnto them, and forgyueth them theyr synnes of whyche they repente, and all the mocyons vnto synne, of whyche they fere that they shall be drawen into synne agayne / and thus they byleue and fele wythout any respecte of theyr owne deseruynge, ye and for none other cause, then that the mercyfull trouth of god the father whyche can not lye, hath so promysed and sworne,
               Now ye remember that Tyndale hath put you by the waye, two specyall greate heresyes. One that who so euer after baptysme

                  che twayne yet it wyll be more honestie for hym to kepe his diffinicyon styll, whervpon all his whole mater hangeth / and let his heresy go to the deuyll yt gaue it to hym / & than vnderstande those places of scripture whervpon the deuill taught hym to grounde it, that eyther the blasphemye agaynste the holy goost is finall impenitence, and the tother  no restytucyon by the penaunce to the reuocacyon of baptysme / or els that the sore wordes of the both places after a certayne vehement maner of speche vsed in holy scripture, somtyme signifyeth onely great hardenes and difficultie, & nat as hym selfe techeth vs, an vttre impossybilyte of remyssyon. But nowe let vs se howe hys diffinicyon wyll stande with his seconde heresye.
               you se well and perceyue, that in his seconde diffinicion he restrayneth his electe churche, vnto onely repentaunte synners that beleue as hym selfe sheweth you.
               And than hathe he confessed vnto you, that his chosyn electes plainly do somtyme abominable dedes / whiche dedes yet they repent nat alwaye, tyll the rage be paste / and tyll as Tyndale saieth yt they ha

                  he churche, tyll they repente agayne. And than consyder ferther, howe farre agaynste all reason.
               ye remembre very well I wote well, that he techeth vs playnly, that none of hys electes dothe at any tyme synne dedely, thoughe theyr dedes be neuer so horryble and abomynable, bycause of theyr felynge faythe whiche can neyther at any tyme fayle, nor suffre any of theyr horryble dedes, to be dedely synne. And therfore are they consequently neuer out of the fauoure of god, nat euen in the tyme

wherein they do theyr horryble and abom ynable dedes, and before the repentynge of them, whiche may be ye wote well many tymes longe betwene. In all whiche tyme they be by Tyndall out of all dedely synne / and therfore good folke and faythefull and goddes good chyldren styll.
               And therfore syth they be so / wherefore dothe Tyndale that is in some places so angery with yt catholyke churche, for the puttynge out of euyll folke by excommunicacyon / excōmunicate good folke now & put out of his elect church hym self & faythfull / and finally suche as thoughe they be fallen a slepe in lechery, thefte, sacrilege, inceste, & murdre, stande yet hyghly styll in goddes especiall grace & fauour.
               Nowe the fautes that are commune to bothe hys diffinicyons, and yet more open in the seconde than in the first / I shall nat nede to reherse you. For bothe haue I touched  some of them before, and also many of theym be to euery good christen man so open at his eye, that he can nede none other way to gyue hym warnynge of them.
               For where all hys electes depende vpon his felynge faythe and hys repentaunce / whyle hym selfe sheweth what false artycles he techeth his electes for theyr faythe euery good faythefull man very well feleth, that the more that Tyndals electes fele his false faythe, the lesse faythe haue they, and the more faythlesse be they.
               And whan he techeth them to repent the ryght belefe of Christes sacramentes, and therein the right rule and ordre of repentaunce: euery true repentaunte persone well perceyueth, that Tyndals repentaunte electes, abhorrynge from shryfte, and reiectynge the sacrament of penaunce

               But nowe suppose that all were very well that Tyndale here hath sayd / yet howe hath he with all that proued hys purpose? He hathe tolde vs that the whole multytude of his fassyoned electes is the church. But what one worde hathe he tolde vs towarde the profe? neyther reason nor one authoryte of any olde holy saynt, nor any one texte of scrypture / but onely one or twayne suche as nothynge maketh for his matter, but vtterly clere agaynste hym.
               
                  
                   And therfore thoughe we graunte vnto hym, that the whole multitude nat of his false framed electes, but of the very fynall electes, be a churche of Christ / as he dothe and muste graunte vnto vs, yt the whole multytude of christen people nat gone out nor put out is a churche of Chryste / of whiche the churche of very electes be, though the better parte, yet a parte and but a parte, and peraduenture the lesse parte / and Tyndals electes, eyther no parte or but a parte, and the very worste parte: yet that the onely electes thoughe they be a churche, be the churche (whiche is the thynge that he shulde proue) that hathe he neyther proued nor any thinge brought effectuall towarde the profe, no more than if he neuer had ment it nor thought it.
               And therfore nowe hathe he nothynge proued whyche  is the churche / thoughe we wolde yet of our courtesye ferther graunte hym, that all hys whole heresyes were the very faythe / and that the very electes were onely those, in whose hartes the deuill hath wrytten his lawe / or els (whi

               Answere vnto the chapyter of Tyndale, in whiche he wold proue that the knowen catholyke chyrche is not ye chyrche. whyther the knowen catholyke chyrche can be the chyrche.
               YE haue all redy good chrysten readers well seen and perceyued, that Tyndale hath in a longe processe labored to proue you, that the chyrch of Cryste is a nother company then the knowen catholyke cō
                  pany  of all chrysten regyons / that is to wytte a certayne secrete scatered congregacyon vnknowen to all the worlde besyde, and to theyr owne felowes to / and euery man by hys inwarde felynge not onely knowen onely to hym selfe, but also so well and surely knowen vnto hym selfe for a vertuouse good and faythefull fynall electe of god, that he is in hym selfe very certayne and sure that he can not be but saued / and that he so hath the spyryte of god imprysoned in hys breste and so faste fetered in hys holy harte, wherof hym selfe hath loste the kayeá, that neyther the spyryte can crepe out nor hym selfe lette hym out by no maner meane / but there muste the spyryt abyde and so preserue and kepe that specyall chosen creature, that he suffer hym to do many great abomynable  horryble deuelysshe dedys, but yet neuer suffer hym in no wyse to do any dedely synne.
               Thys I saye ye haue all redy seen, that Tyndale hath by a longe processe labored mych to proue vs / and hath in cōclusyon not onely no thynge proued vs therof, but hath in stede of felynge faythfull folke, brought vs forth suche a sort, as neuer was there puddynge stuffed so full of farsynge, as hys holy felynge faythfull folke are farsed full of heresyes.
               wherfore seynge that for the very chyrche of Cryste here in erth, whyche god hath and euer shall instructe and preserue in hys trewe fayth and out of the fayth of whyche chyrch shall neyther be trewe fayth hope nor cherite / he can when he hath all done fynde out none other, then thys comon knowen catholyke chyrche of all chrysten people, neyther

of malyce gone out nor for obstinacy put out / of which  comon knowen catholyke chyrche, all the good and trewe penytent electes be parteners in fayth: seynge I saye that he can proue none other chyrche, he now gothe aboute to dysproue that chyrche to / wherby we maye well perceyue that he goeth not aboute to fynde out the chyrche, but rather to make men to wene that there were no chyrch at all.
               About thys purpose vseth he now thys order. Fyrste in one chapyter he taketh vppon hym to proue yt the knowen catholyke chyrche is not the chyrche of Cryste.
               Afterwarde in hys other chapyters folowynge, he pretendeth to answere and soyle the reasons, wyth whyche it is proued that the knowen catholyke chyrche is the chyrche of Cryste, and that none of these sectes of heretykes be.
               
               And yet pretendynge as I say that he wyll soyle all the reasons of the tother syde / of so many as there are he towcheth onely twayne / and yet those twayne how symple he soyleth, that shall you after se.
               Let vs now go to Tyndals fyrste poynte / whych poynt in hys fyrste chapyter how falsely he handeleth and how farre fro the poynt, it is euyn a world to se. For fyrst he maketh the tytle before hys chapyter in thys wyse.
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     Whyther the pope and his secte be Crystes chyrche or no.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  well ye wote good chrysten readers, that I (whose dyaloge in the begynnyng of hys wurke he professeth hym selfe wyth all hys hole boke to answere) haue in places  inough well and playnely declared, that I call the chyrche of Cryste the catholyke knowen chyrche of all chrysten nacyons, neyther gone out nor cut of. And all be it that all these nacyons now do and longe haue done, recognysed & knowleged the pope, not as the byshop of rome but as the successoure of saynt Peter, to be theyr chyefe spyrytuall gouernour vnder god, and Chrystes vycar in erth / and so do not onely we call hym but Tyndalys owne felowe frere Barns to: yet dyde I neuer put the pope for parte of the dyffynycyon of the chyrche, dyffynyng the chyrche to be the comon knowen congregacyon of all chrysten nacyons vnder one hed the pope.
                  Thus dyd I neuer defyne the chyrche / but purposely declyned therfro, bycause I wolde not intryke & entangle

                      the mater wyth two questyons at onys. For I wyste very well that the chyrche beynge proued thys comon knowen catholyke congregacyon of all chrysten nacyons, abydyng to gyther in one fayth, neyther fallen of nor cut of: there myghte be peraduenture made a secunde questyon after y•, whyther ouer all that catholyke chyrche the pope muste nedes be hed and chyefe gouernour or chyefe spyrytuall shepherde / or ellys that ye vnyon of fayth standyng among them all, euery prouynce myghte haue theyr owne chyefe spyrytuall gouernour ouer it selfe, wythout any recourse vnto the pope, or any superyoryte recognysed to any other outwarde person.
                  And then yf the pope were or no pope / but as I say prouyncyall  patryarches, arbysshoppes, or metropolytanes, or by what name so euer the thynge were called: what authoryte & what power eyther he or they sholde haue among the people, these thynges well I wyste wolde rayse among many men many mo questyons then one. For the aduoydyng of all intrycacyō wherof / I purposely forbare to put in the pope as parte of the dyffynycyon of the chyrche, as a thynge that neded not / syth yf he be the necessary hed, he is included in the name of the hole body. And whyther he be or not / yf it be brought in questyon, were a mater to be treated and dysputed besyde.
                  And therfore maye y
                        •
                      good chrysten readers se, yt Tyndale whyche in thys poynte wyll in no wyse perceyue me, but maketh the tytle of hys chapyter whyther the pope and  hys secte be chrystes chyrche or no / laboreth to fle fro the lyght, and hyde hys hed in the darke, and confounde the mater wyth two, questyons at onys.
                  Now is not the tytle of hys chapyter so synystrely wryten and wryed awaye from the poynt / but the begynnynge of hys chapyter it selfe, is mych worse and forther wrested wronge. For lo thus he begynneth.
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     That the pope and his spirites be not the chyrche maye this wyse be proued.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Lo before in the tytle he made hys questyon of the pope and hys secte, whyche questyon as I haue shewed you he framed farre from the mater / and syth those people whych Tyndale calleth ye popys secte (by whych name he meneth all that professe the comon catholyke fayth) be all the nacyons

chrystened, excepte a few late fallen to Luther, wyclyffe, frere Huskyn, and zuynglius: how fyttly he vseth his termes in callynge all the body a secte, whyche he myghte as well call a scysme, for bothe sygnyfye a cuttyng of from the hole chyrche / and then as well he maye and so doth he soone after, call the heretykes y• chyrche / and therin calleth he bothe twayne as properly, as yf he wolde cut of a cantell or a gobbet from an hole lofe, and then call the cantell a lofe and the lofe a cantell.
                  But where as before in the tytle he made as I saye hys questyon of the pope and hys secte / here he turneth it into the pope and hys spyrytes. In whyche excepte he call spyrytes in mocke & scorne / all chrysten nacyons besydes those corners that professe them selfe for heretykes / he muste nedes  mene here by hys scornefull name of spyrytes, onely the pope and the spyrytualtye / and then goeth he yet mych forther fro me wyth whom he sholde cope. For I call euer the chyrche whyche hys parte is here to impugne, not the spyrytualtye onely, but the hole corps and body of spyrytuall and temporall to.
                  And Tyndale very well woteth, that the spyrytualtye so farforth doth accompte not them selfe alone but the temporaltye, and them selfe to gether for the catholyke chyrch / that there is not so pore a frere, but he professyth it almost in euery sermone. In whyche when he exhorteth hys audyence to praye for the chyrche, he sayth not ye shall praye for the spyrytualtye alone / but ye shall saythe he praye for the thre estates of holy chyrche, that is to wytte the spyrytualty  the temporalty and the sowles that be in purgatory. For though they be departed out of our cōpany, yet them compte we styll for viagers and pylgrymmes in the same pylgrymage that we be towarde the same place of rest and welth that we walke, tyll they be passed ones all the payne of theyr iournaye, and entred into the blesse of heuen.
                  Nowe it is a greate shame for Tyndale to flye fro the poynte as he dothe, in a mater so playne and open, that euery chylde maye se how lothe he is to comme nere and cope.
                  But Tyndale hath all redy ryden so many shrewed courses, in whyche he hath hadde suche buffettes, that he hath almoste broken hys horses backe and hys owne to / that now neyther is there bere nor heretyke more lothe to

                  Some man wolde here peraduenture saye to Tyndale, that he playeth in thys poynte the very folysshe dysour, for the faute of the man to rayle vpon the offyce / consyderyng that all be it there haue popes bene that haue euyll played theyr partes, yet haue there ben popes agayne ryghte holy men sayntes and martyrs to / and therfore in iestynge thus vppon a good offyce for an euyll offycer, he canne

lacke no mater of raylynge, but maye runne out in hys  rybaldry at large, and saye that all the hole worlde muste leue of all maner of offyces, and neyther haue pope, emperour, kynge, counsaylour, mayre, shyryffe, nor alderman to gouerne or rule the comons, nor yet any man in hys owne howse stewarde, cater, pantler, butler, or cooke. For among all these offyces there can be founden none, that hath not had ere thys many an yll man in the rome.
                  Therfore wolde some man thynke I saye, that Tyndals raylynge here vppon the pope were all ronne out of reason, though that all the thynges whyche he layeth here to hys charge, were in dede as euyll as Tyndale wolde haue them taken. But surely syth the man hath fawtes inough besyde / I wyll my selfe defende hym well in thys. For thys wyll I well make good in his byhalfe, that yf the fawtes for whyche he rayleth here vpon the pope, be thynges noughte in dede and worthy to be rebuked / then maye he well and lawfully ryally ieste and rayle vppon the hole pedegre of popes, saynt Peter hym selfe and all. For surely the thynges for ye techynge wherof Tyndale rebuketh here the pope, hath euer ben the doctryne of popes, patriarches, prophetes, apostles, and our sauyour hym selfe and all.
                  For fyrste he proueth vs that the pope byleueth not to be saued thorow Christ, bycause he techeth to truste in holy workes for remyssyon of synnes and saluacyō. Is not here a peryllous lesson trow ye / namely so taught as the chyrch techeth it, that no good work can be done wythout helpe of goddes grace, nor no good worke of man worthy the rewarde  of heuen but by the lyberall goodnesse of god, nor yet sholde haue suche a pryce sette vppon it saue thorowe the merytes of Crystes bytter passyon / and that yet in all our dedes we be so vnperfyt, yt eche man hath good cause to fere for hys owne parte, leste his beste be badde. I wolde wene that good workes were not so dedely poyson / but takynge not to myche at onys for cloyenge of the stomake, no more at onys lo then I se the worlde wont to do many drammes of suche tryacle myxed with one scruple of drede, were able inough for awght that I can se so to preserue the soule fro presumpcyon, that one sponefull of good workes sholde no more kylle the soule, then a potager of good wurtes sholde kylle and stroye the body.

                  Than goeth he from good lyuers in erth vnto sayntes in heuyn / & fyndeth yet more faute, in that men are taught  to go in any pylgrymage, or do any worshyp to them, or to thynke that theyr good lyuyng was so pleasaūt vnto god whyle they lyued here in erth, that he wyll therfore vouchesaufe to do any thynge at theyr requeste for any louer of theyres, whyle they be wyth hym in heuyn.
                  Howe be it in thys poynt I dare be bolde to say for Tyndale my selfe, that he is nat so folysh, but that he seeth well I nough that if I may well pray my neyghbur to pray for me that is here wyth me in erthe / I may moche better pray the sayntes pray for me that are with god in heuyn / sauing that he byleueth that they be nat there, nor neyther here vs nor se vs, but lye styll as Luther sayth a slepe. And therfore Tyndale leste we myghte wene that he byleued well, byddeth vs in another place of hys boke, that when we mete ye

For now he sayth that they be but superstycyouse and serue of noughte, but be sette in stede of Cryste, and are (as they be taught) the denyenge of Crystes bloude.
                  How sholde they now be the denyeng of Crystes bloud, when the chyrche teacheth vs as god hath taught it, that they all haue theyr strength by Crystes bloude, and that in the tone of them is Crystes owne very bloude and hys blessed body bothe. Bothe whyche thys heretyke denyeth / and as in my fyrste boke I shewed yow, bothe iesteth and scoffeth vppon the precyouse body and bloude of Cryste in the  blessed sacrament of the aulter / and lyke a madde frantyke fole maketh mokkes and mowys at the masse.
                  And now that ye se good chrysten reders for what doctryne Tyndale rebuketh the comon catholyke chyrche / ye can not but therby perceyue what doctryne he wolde haue them teche / that is to wytte that we shold haue no respecte to good workes, vse no shryfte nor penaunce, beware of chastyte and blesse vs well therfro, let no good men praye for vs, nor none that vse holy lyuynge, no Francysce frere bydde any bede for vs in hys freres cote, tyll he do of hys graye garmentes and cloth hym selfe cumly in gaye kendall grene / sette sayntes at nought, and all holy ceremonyes vsed in goddes seruyse, and als the seuen sacramētes to / make mokkes at the masse and at Crystes body, and  take it for nothynge but cake brede or starche.

He proueth that they consent nat that goddes lawe is good, bycause they make he sayth lawes of theyr owne byside / & therfore he sayth that they nat onely consent nat that goddes lawe is good, but also that they raygne ouer chrysten people lyke temporall tyrauntes

                      taken away, but kynges & kynges lawes to, if theyre purpose myght prosper / & make all people lawles, bycause all lawes are lettes as they take theym to theyr euangelicall libertie by whych they clayme to be bounden or compelled to nothyng, but exhorted onely to lyue euery man after the gospell, by euery man, expouned after hys owne mynde whych maner of exhortyng amounteth vnto as moche, as to let all rune at ryot wythout any bond or brydell, & than exhort euery man to lyue as he lyste hym selfe.
                  But now is it good to se what lawe so specyally lyeth in Tyndals eye / for whyche he generally rayleth vpon all the remanaunt. That is for that he sayeth that the pope hath forboden lawfull wedlocke. In thys he meneth two thynges, with whych two Luther and wyclyffe were euyll  content before.

                  But thys thynge, to whyche pope wyll Tyndale laye? For he shall fynde that in these thynges the olde holy pope saynt Gregory and dyuers other holy popes to, and not popes onely but also dyuers counsayles and great assemblees of holy vertues fathers, haue in olde tyme sone vpon chrystendome well spredde abrode, for encreace of naturall honesty and propagacyō of chrysten cheryte, forboden maryage to be made wyth other degrees bothe of kynred and affynyte, mych forther of then they that abyde now forboden / wyth whyche the chyrche hath synnys for our infyrmytye dyspensed and vndone the bonde / so that in that poynt the faute that Tyndale, wyclyffe, and Luther lay vnto the pope, they muste laye to so many suche popes and other holy men besyde, that who so consyder the tone sorte & the tother wyll haue lytell luste to byleue thre or foure nowe suche maner folke as Tyndale and hys fonde felowes be, agaynste so many vertuouse old holy fathers as they were that made those lawes.
                  The tother law that he layeth so sore agaynst the pope, is that prestes, freres, chanons, monkes and nunnes, may not be suffred to be wedded, contrary to theyr owne vowys and promyses made vnto god, whyche no man compelled them to make. Is not thys a greate fawte tha

                  But Tyndale letteth not to lye out alowde, and saye that the pope hath hym selfe graunted vnlawfull whoredome to as many as brynge money / and in another place of hys boke he sayth, that the pope hath in Rome sette vp a stewys of boyes.

                      And myche more is then intollerable to suffer any suche ribauldes to the rebuke of any state, to put forth any raylynge bokes / whyche malyciouse maner is by all other lawes vppon great payne forboden, though the mater touche a ryght mene persone.
                  And all thys I saye yet / as though I graunted that the pope had made that lawe that Tyndale here sayth he dyd.
                  But now yf it be false ye Tyndale sayth, & that of trouth the pope made not that lawe, but that the wordes whyche Tyndale reherseth be no law at all, nor spoken nor wryten by any pope, but by some other that was neuer pope / what is Tyndale than, that sayth the pope hath made those wordes for a playne lawe.
                  Those wordes whiche Tindale sayth are a playne law  made by the pope / are in dede incorporate in the boke of the decrees, in the same distinccion and place where Tyndale allegeth them. But than is Tyndale very ignoraunt, yf he know not that though there be in that boke of the decrees many thynges that be lawes, & that were by diuers popes and dyuers synodys and counsayles made for lawes / yet are there in that boke many thynges besyde, that neyther were made by any synode nor by any pope / but wryten by dyuers good holy men. Out of whose holy workes as well as out of synodys and counsayles and popes wrytynge, Gracyane a good vertuouse and well lerned man, compyled and gathered that boke / whych is therfore called the decees of Gracyan, as an other lyke booke is called the decrees of Iuo, whyche out of lyke authoryte cōpyled a lyke  worke. Now is euery thynge that is alledged and inserted in the bokes of those decrees, of suche authoryte there, as it is in the place out of whyche Gracian or Iuo gathered it / and not a lawe nor a thynge made by the pope, but yf it were a lawe or made by a pope before, and out of a lawe or out of a popys wrytynge taken in to the decrees.
                  Now the wordes whyche Tyndale bryngeth forth, and sayth that the pope hath made theym for a lawe, be not the wordes of ony pope / but they be the wordes of the blessed holy martyr saynt Boniface whych brought the fayth in to Almayne, and was for the fayth martyred in Freselande. And so is it playnely specyfyed in the decrees, by those wordes in the rubryce, Exdictis Bonifacit martyris.
                  But Tyndale to blynde and begyle the readers wyth / 

                      wold make mē wene that it were the popys wordes made for a playne lawe. wherin Tyndale playnely sheweth hys playne open falshed, excepte he were so wyse that he hadde went the pope had made it for a law, by cause it begynneth with S

               The fourth reason.
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     And Poule sayeth Ro. 13. let euery soule obay the hygher powers, that are ordayned to punysshe synne. The pope wyll nat nor let any of his.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  
                      Touchynge fyrste the pope hym selfe, Tyndale telleth vs here a wyse tale. For settynge a syde the questyon whether the pope eyther be or rightfully ought to be, chefe gouernoure ouer the chrysten flocke / and if he be or ought to be, howe farre than and to what thynges his authorytie stretcheth or ought to stretche: This thynge at the leastewyse Tyndale very well knoweth hym selfe, that neyther in spirituall thynges nor in temporall, there is no man at Rome in his owne see, that claymeth any power or iurisdiccyon vpon hym. And as for the clergye besydes, Tyndale here as farre as I se, falsely belyeth the pope. For he letteth none of his to obay their higher powers / but by the canon lawes of the churche, commaundeth euery of them to obay theyr hygher powers, and to kepe and obserue the  lawes of the princes and countreys that they lyue in.
                  But the thynge that greueth Tyndale is this / that any preest shulde in honoure of the sacramente of preesthode, haue any maner of preuiledge more than a lay man. For his heresye rekeneth euery woman a preest, and as able to say masse as euer was saynt Peter. And in good faythe as for suche masses as he wold haue sayd, without the canon, without the secretes, without oblacyon, without sacrifyce, without the body or blode of Christ, with bare sygnes and tokens in stede of the blessed sacrament: I wene a woman were in dede a more mete preest than saynt Peter.
                  And all be it that neyther woman may be preest, nor any man is preest or hath power to say masse, but yf he be by the sacrament of holy orders taken and cōsecrated into

that offyce: yet syth the tyme that Tyndale hath begonne  his heresyes,

                  All holy consecracyons Tyndale calleth folysshe ceremonyes / forgettyng that in the olde lawe dyuers tymes it  is honorably rehersed and layde for a cause of the

And be cōpelleth .x. paryshes to paye theyr tythes and offerynges vnto one such, to go and runne at ryot at theyr cost, and to do nought therfore.

And no doubte is there, but that some man may ryghte well haue the cure of dyuers parisshes, and good causes why he so shulde / and do more good in them bothe tha

                  Nowe where he sayeth that whore kepers and suche other as saynt Poule forbyddeth vs the company, the pope with vyolence compell

                     th vs to haue in honoure, and to receyue the sacramentes of them, and to here their masses, and to beleue all that that they say: This is a very lowdelye. For the pope letteth you nat to complayne vpon them / and the lawes of the churche be, that for their crymes they shalbe suspended from the medelynge and adminystracion of suche thynges / and somtyme deposed of theyr offyces, depriued of theyr benefyces, and degraded of their orders to. And therfore the pope comp
                        •
                     lleth hym nat with vyolence to do them honoure in their vyces. And if there were

any that dyd / he were in the doynge an euyll pope as he  were an euyll man. But what were the faute of an euyll pope to the offyce of the papacy / excepte that Tyndale wyl reproue and rebuke euery kynge and prynce, and wolde haue none at all, bycause that some of theym somtyme do not alway theyr dewtye / or wyll lay to the prynces charge yf any offycer vnder hym do not euery man such ryght as the prynce wolde he sholde, and trusteth also that he dothe. Now where he sayth that the pope compelleth hym to byleue all that euery suche preste sayth: y• is yet another lye ones agayne. For yf the preste say salse, & preche heresyes / as yf he wold say that all the seuen sacramētes be but bare sygnes & tokens, & that freres may lawfully wedde nūnes: the pope compelleth no man with violence to byleue that preste / nor compelled not Tyndale neyther agaynste the  playne scrypture of god, in suche frantyke heresyes to byleue y• lewd lernyng of Luther, frere Huyskyn, & Denckiꝰ, Baltasar, Lambert, and Suinglius / of all whyche neuer one byleueth other. But the pope is well content & so wold it sholde be, that yf the preste preche suche heresyes, folke shall not byleue hym but accuse hym, and haue hym reformed, & reuoke them, and abiure them / or ellys let degrade hym and delyuer hym, and let the prynces kepe hym from the people. wherof to be sure and for auoydynge of such he resyes by the terrour of that ensample / good chrysten prynces cause faythfull people to burne hym.
                  Buf then is there one thyng wherwyth Tyndale is sore dyspleased, that the pope wyll not as he sayth let hym and hys felowes se whyther the preste say well or no.
                  
                  If the preste be accused of hys doctryne / he is as I saye broughte vnto examynacyon, to wytte whyther he sayed trewth or no. what other way wolde Tyndale haue? It is playne inough what he meneth in thys mater. He meneth therin nothynge ellys, but that he wolde haue all thyng so ferforth sette at large, that he myght brynge fyrst in dowte and questyon, and after in errours and heresyes vpon the questyon, euery poynt of Crystes catholike fayth, that god hath by hys holy blessed spyryte in .xv.C. yere taught hys catholyke chyrche. And then all thynges ones brought in that euangelycall liberty, that euery man may byleue euen as hym lyst, and after that lyue euyn as hym lyste to, with out any lorde or any lawe to lette hym / then lo to make the

                     offeth out, wyth a lyke argument of hys owne makynge / he telleth you not where he redde. But it well appereth that he hath redde it in other mennes bokes besyde myne / for ellys he wolde not saye one of theyr hyghe reasons, but one of hys hyghe reasons yf he toke the reasō but for myne alone.
                  But thys is hys fasshyon lo in all thynges / he maketh as though he mocke but men of these later dayes / whyche

                      latter dayes hym selfe calleth yet eyght hundred yere and more. But he mocketh in dede those olde holy doctours, whiche dyed and some were martyred aboue a thousande yere agone.
                  For ye shall vnderstande that this reason whiche Tyndale so scornefully reherseth, and wolde seme to shake of so lyghtly / was nat only made by me in my dyaloge, but also before my dayes by dyuers good and great connyng men. And amonge other, thys reason that Tyndale in scorne calleth an hyghe reason / was made by that great fa

                     ous doctourand hyghe gloryous martyr saynte Cyprian, agaynste Nouatiane and fortunacian, and other heretykes and scysmatykes, in and before his dayes.
                  Nowe is saynt Cyprian a man of suche authoryte, that  the greate holy doctour saynte Austayne, alledgeth as reuerently saynt Cyprian as any man now alledgeth saint Austyne.
                  And thys reason that Tyndale nowe derydeth and mocketh / saynt Cyprian thought so sure, specially so furnysshed with scryptures as he sette hit forthe, that he vseth it nat ones or twyse / but in sondry places so often agaynst heretykes, that it maketh me euyn sory to se howe sore god suffred that good saynte to be deceyued, yf an heretyke myght nowe by a lyke formed argumente lo shortely and so shamefully shake hys reason of.
                  But I wyll nat do saynt Cyprian so moche dishonour, as to sette hym to dispute with Tyndale. But syth Tyndale and I be somwhat more metely matches. He & I shal  therfore betwene vs twayne fyrst dispute and discusse / and than you good christen reders shall after discerne & iudge, whether the reason that he reherseth and the reason that he maketh, by whiche as by the lyke he wolde fayne seme to soyle it, be as he sayeth they be, bothe lyke and bothe one or not.
                  For the better perceyuynge wherof, ye shall vnderstāde that where as in my dyaloge I had proued fyrste that the churche of Christe here in erthe, shall euer endure and contynue as longe as the worlde shall laste / whiche thynge is I doubte nat in suche wyse proued there, that Tyndale dare nat hym selfe denye it here: I than in the secōde boke dyd after proue, that the knowen catholike church is that same churche / and none of all the sectes of heretykes, bycause

all they be come out of it / and that therfore all they  be but braunches cut of or broken of frome thys vyne of Crystes mystycall body the knowen catholyke chyrche / & that syth they be from the stocke, they therfore drye vp and wythere awaye, and ware worth no thynge, nor mete for no thynge but worthy for the fyre.
                  And so thys reasō that Tyndale here reherseth, I there laye forth and declare with dyuerse places of scrypture / by whyche I proue at good length thorow all the seconde chapyter, that suche as go out of thys knowen catholyke chyrche, be and alwaye haue ben the heretykes, and for heretykes be declared by the very scripture it self. wherof I there by some places, as some suche as saynte Cypryane sayeth hym self / how be it of trouth not all the places of scrypture that he layeth for that purpose, bycause I had not at that  tyme redde and marked saynt Cypryane vpon that poynt.
                  Now commeth Tyndale and barely reherseth my reason, dyssymulynge after hys accustumed fasshyon all that euer I layed forth for the profe. Of all whyche thynges neyther in hys answere here whych he calleth hys solucyō, nor afterwarde when he cometh to the place in hys pertycular answerys vnto euery chapyter in order, he neuer maketh any maner mēcy on / but when he cometh to my secōde boke, goeth fro the fyrste chapyter to the thyrde, as though the prenter had lefte the secunde vnprynted.
                  Is not this fashyō a playne cōfession of his ignoraūce, and that he was at hys wyttes ende, and sawe not what to saye vnto it. And bycause he lefte all my profe of my reason vntouched / he durst not here for shame speke of my name, nor be a knowen that he redde that reason in my boke / lest men sholde loke for it, and spye that I

                  And in good fayth, I neuer loked that euer I shold haue fownden any man so folysshe as to wene that he were able to soyle it wyth thys argument that Tyndale here

                      frameth for a lyke / or that any man were so blynde of wyt as to wene that those two argumentes were lyke.
                  For remembre nowe good reder, that the churche of Christ must as I haue in my dyaloge proued by scripture, laste and contynue for euer, and christes church can be bu

And therfore the erthe syth he is in the very myddes, that is the most inwarde place of ye whole world / he is therfore in the lowest for of the whole worlde / the innest is as I tolde you the lowest. And than syth the erth lyeth in the lowest / hys owne weyght ye wote well muste nedes holde hym there / bycause ye perceyue your selfe that no heuy thing can of hym selfe ascende vpwarde. And than the erthe lyenge all redy in the lowest place / if he shulde fall out of place on any syde, lyke as he shulde fall frome the inner parte to the vtter / so shulde he fall fro the lower place into the hygher.

                  It were to longe a tale to tell you all theyr dyspycyons. For wordes wold she none haue lacked, though they shold haue dysputed the space of seuyn yere.

                  Nowe playeth Tyndale euyn the same parte with me / and maketh an argument and a sample of the sinagoge, as lyke to the churche of Chryste for the poynte that we speke of, that is concernynge our sauyour with his apostels goynge out of the synagoge of the Iewes, and chrysten people goynge out of the churche of Christ / as the wharle was lyke the worlde, concernynge the stone to go thorowe the wharle, & the stone to fall thorowe the erthe, or the whole erthe to fall into the mone whan the sonne were ouer oure hedes and the mone on the tother syde in the contrarye  sygne.
                  For I thynke that no man wyll desyre to haue it proued that the chyrche or Synagoge of the Iewys was not ordayned to laste for euer / but to ceace and gyue place vnto Chryste at hys commynge / and that he sholde then in stede of the synagoge of the Iewys, begynne and contynue hys chyrche bothe of Iewys and Gentyls / and that then sholde be of the Iewys peculyar chyrche & peculyar lawes and sacramentes and ceremonyes an ende / and that the chyrche of Chryst as longe as the world sholde laste, s

                  Now these thynges beynge thus / consyder good chrysten reader how lyke these two reasons are to gyther, Tyndales I mene and myne / whyche two Tyndale sayth be not onely lyke, but also be bothe one.
                  Chryst and hys apostles and saynt Iohn̄ baptyste went out of the chyrche or synagoge of the Iewys / bycause the tyme was come in whyche by goddes owne ordynaunce, the Iewys chyrche or synagoge sholde haue an ende.

                  Also Cryst and his apostles went out of the olde chyrch to begynne one new chyrche of all people agreynge in one fayth ether wyth other. And therfore Luther, Tyndale, Huyskyn, and Suinglius, be gone out of the olde chyrch, to begynne a great many new dyuers chyrchers, of whych neuer one shold agre with other / nor almost in any of them any one man wyth other.
                  Fynally Chryste went wyth hys apostles out of the old chyrche to begynne a newe, that was prophecyed to be a  perpetuall chyrche wythout ende, agaynste whych the gates of hell sholde neuer preuayle.

All whome the very gates of hell haue so preuayled agaynste / that they haue gotten them in and shette them faste in and fast kepe them in wyth the dampned deuels wyth flame and fyre in the depe dongeon of hell.

If he dyd not / wherof serueth hys processe of his hundred prophetes?
                  Also god punysshed his peole / and then sent his prophetes, not to make sedycyone and sectes amonge hys people, but to gouerne and lede hys whole flocke and hys whole people to gether. As he caused Moyses to cōuaye hys hole people out of Egypte / and the other prophetes, iudges, & prestes after, in to the lande of byheste. was there euer any of those heretykes whom the catholyke chyrche hath from the begynnynge condempned, that euer so dyd? Let Tyndale name vs one.
                  
                     Then yf he wyll saye that euery prophete dyd not so, but some dyd as he doth and suche other as we call heretykes, as wrongfully as yf we called an

                  Besydes thys, those olde prophetes proued them self by myracles to be messengers sent frome god. But Luther, Tyndale, Huyskyn, and Suinglius, shew no myracles at all to shew them selfe messengers sent by god but by theyr euyll doctryne clerely proue them selfe messengers sent by  the deuyll.
                  And fynally as farre as the chyrche or synagoge of the Iewys was decayed in fayth, or good lyuynge decayed by the false doctryne or false glos

                     s of the scrybes and pharysees, Cayphas, Anna, and thelders / whyche were as Tyndale sayth crepte vp into the seate of Moyses, Aaron, and the holy prophetes and patryarche agaynst the commyng of Chryste / and whom Chryste for theyr false doctryne dyd rebuke: yet confesseth Tyndale hym selfe, that they kepte the people frome outwarde idolatrye of worshyppynge of idols wyth the hethen.
                  And Tyndale muste confesse ferther, that neyther scrybes nor pharysees, nor preste, nor elders, as he calleth them no nor yongers neyther yf he wyll haue all the temporalty  called yōgers, as he wyll haue all the clergy called elders / were not euyn at y• tyme all of one sorte / but as there were many naughte of euery sorte, so was there of euery sorte ryght good folke also.
                  And as for theyr tradycyons and doctryne, of whyche was many vayne, some euyll & some superstycyouse, wherby the people amonge them toke harme in the folowynge: suche as were euyll thynges were not so fully determyned but that some were of one mynde some of other / and therin men myghte folowe the beste doctryne yf they wolde, wher in they had doctours and teachers to / and myghte yf they were desyrouse of the beste, very well decerne them concernynge the glosyng of scrypture, by the olde vertuouse doctours

                      that had in sondry ages longe before the false exposicions and false doctrine of the phariseis or false scribes began, truely constred and expowned bothe the law & the prohetes / by whose exposicions they myght trye and controll the false doctrine of the noughty scribes & euyll phariseis (for good scribes were there and good phariseis to / as by the newe testament appereth). And that there were of olde in euery age suche trewe doctours and expositours amonge the Iewis, maye well appere to euery man that considereth variaunce in the exposicions of the scripture, by the Iewis that were of olde before the byrthe of Christ, and theym that expowned it after.
                  And also Tyndale saith hym selfe, that betwen the tyme of Moyses and the cummynge of Christe / god styred vppe  an hundred prophetes. And therfore I am sure of the remenaunt besyde the .xii. that we haue, he meneth for some, that kinde of doctours and expositours that I speke of or elles I wene he wyll cum shorte of his whole summe, and lacke fyue of his hundred.
                  And thus thoughe god dyd nat prouide so fully for the chyrche of the Iewis, as for the chyrche of Christe / as in whiche he hathe prouided and promised to dwell hym selfe for euer: yet prouided he for it so sufficiently, that they myght therin be saued and entre heuen when it were after open / and that in euyll doctrine and supersticiouse traditions, they coulde nat be dampned, if they were desirouse & diligent about theyr owne soule helthe. And al be it that bycause the thynge had than so great difficultie, that many  for lacke of sufficient diligence perisshed: god of his great mercy suffred not those noughty scribes & false phariseis to continue long / but to make an easy way in which no man coulde be deceiued excepte suche as were ouer necligent or maliciouse, but shulde sone be lerned the sure truthe and vndoubted way to heuyn, sent his owne sonne to begynne a new chyrche of a new fasshion, of a nother maner of perfection / in whiche he wolde so be present and assistent for euer hym selfe and his owne holy spirite, and so teche it and so lede it into euery trouthe, that no man coulde be deceiued, but he that wold nat byleue his chi

dyd set vp his chyrche / the sinagoge was the very chyrch /  and with suche as were nat wyllyngly blynde, was knowen for the very chyrche of god diuided from all the world byside, by goddes law, by gouernours of his assignement by trewe prophetes, trewe precheours and miracles, for all the false prophetes and false precheours that were therein byside.

                  And thus it appereth lo, that concernyng the synagoge euyn at the comynge of Chryst / Tyndale hath here wonne lytell grounde to buylde hys purpose vppon / but that euen there was yet at that tyme the very chyrche and a chyrche also knowen. And therfore when he goth now ferther and resembleth it vnto the knowen catholyke chyrch of Chryst  though they were lyke: yet were Tyndale ouerthrowen.

                     And thus I saye that neyther can Tyndale stande by  hys vnknowen chyrche, nor for his purpose suffycyently resemble the catholyke chyrch of Cryst vnto ye synagoge of ye Iewys, nor the clergye of the tone to the scrybes and pharyseys of the tother / syth god gaue these two chyrches not lyke begynnyng / nor Moyses that was the lawyere & begynner of the tone, was not lyke vnto Crist the begynner & lawyer of the tother / nor the promyses of god concernyng his assystēce & preseruynge, were not lyke in the tone chyrche & the tother. And yet by Tyndale, god had so lytell regarded his great promises in that point, that where as the scrybes & pharyseis had ben but a whyle in respecte, & god had sent the synagoge sundry prophetes, & Cryst hasted to come because they shold not deceyue lōge: god had suffred ye catholyke chyrch of his own onely bygotē sonne to be as  falsely deceyued & wurse to, & ferther to be ledde out of the ryght way into errours & into dāpnacyon, more then this viii.C. yere togyther, without any man sent to shewe them the ryght vnderstandyng of scrypture & the ryght way, by any such mene as the peple myghte perceyue that the man were comen frō god / but one of them alway varyenge fro the doctryne of an other and all varyenge fro the doctryne of all the sayntes, whom god had proued hys messengers by myracles / wherof these men shewed none at all, and yet the moste parte euer as they were examyned and oppossed, abiured theyr owne doctryne to. And thus as I saye Tyndale can not resēble the clergye of Crystes chyrche to the scrybes and pharyseys of the Iewys chyrche.
                  But yet yf Tyndale stycke so sore thereto, that he wyll  nedes haue theym lyke / and whyle he can neuer proue it, wyll yet wyth greate wordes and othys happely to, bere me downe ryght styll in hande it is so: let vs to stoppe his mouth with, graunte hym for thys onys that it were so / & se than what he coulde yet gete therby, that for his purpose were well worth a flye.
                  Though it so were in dede / yet must Tyndale be boūdē to obaye theym perde, as ferforth at the leste as Chryste cō
                     maunded the Iewys to obaye the tother.
                  Than yf Tyndale wyll saye that it can extende no ferther, then euen barely to as farforth as they teche & preche the gospell truely / and that euery man and woman whom they teche and to whom they preche, maye saye not onely

                      to one of them that he constreweth the scrypture wronge & techeth the people false, but also that the same techynge of that one man beynge examyned and affermed for trewe by the whole clergye assembled to gyther, ye and by the prynces and the lordes, and by bothe the lerned and vnlerned laye people to, maye yet tell them vppon Tyndals mouth or Luthers, that they lye euerychone / & all the clergy falsely constreweth the scrypture, and all the temporaltye folysshely foloweth theyr construccyon / and so the tone blynd wyth malyce ledeth the tother blynde wyth foly into the dych of dampnacyon / and there they lye tomblynge to gyther, whyle thys lyghtsome elect of Tyndale that shall tell all the chyrche thys tale, seeth playnely the trouth / and is illumyned by Luther, Tyndale, frere Huyskyn, or Suynglius,  and lawgheth the foly of all the knowen catholyke chyrche to scorne: yf Tyndale come to thys poynt, he wyll at the leste wyse euer gyue vs leue to resorte to the Iewys synagoge, wyth the scrybes and the pharyseys, to whyche he resembleth vs.
                  Now let vs thenne ymagyne that Tyndale as he was borne hethen and chrystened in England, so had ben borne a paynyme & cyrcumcysed in Hierusalem, foure yere before the byrth of Christ, by the reason that beyng at yeres of dyscrecyon, & heryng of the stories & the temple & maners of y• Iewys, he had of deuocyon sodaynly fallen into theyr synagoge, and dwelled in Hierusalem / wheruppon yet after hys cyrcumcysyon consyderynge that there were amonge them dyuers sortes & sectes, as pharyseys and Saduceys,  and scrybes and leuytes, and prestes, and laye people / and though they were all Iewes and agreed in cyrcumcysyon, and came of olde all of one stocke, yet be now seuered a sunder in doctryne and in bylyefe, and that not in small thynges but in suche thynges as the one secte dyd reken and accompte the tother to stande in greate errour and dampnable: what wolde Tyndale haue done in thys case? wold he wythout any other reder haue taken the bokes of theyr scryptures into hys owne hande / and therof wythout any credence gyuen vnto any man, pyke out the trouth by hym selfe? he sholde haue therin a very hard worke / and were very lykely to frame hym selfe a newe fayth in many great thynges, agreyng wyth no man but wyth hym selfe.

                  Then wold he of lykelyhed haue had recourse to them, and enquere of them the solucion of those dowtys. For out of the chyrche or synagoge of the Iewys, it is not lykely yt euer he wolde haue loked to haue ye treuth of those dowtes determyned, whyche dowtes ryse vp theyr lawe and vpon the construccyon fo theyr scryptures.
                  And also consyderynge the myracles that god hadde so greate and so many very oftentymes shewed in euery age for that synagoge, and that in that synagoge some contynued styll, suche as hym selfe had sene in the pole of the tē

Now of these holy doctours and prophetes we haue  the bookes of euery age, sum frome the dethe of Christes apostles euyn vnto our owne tyme. Now myght it than by theyr bokes be perceyuyd, that these folke now crept vp as Tyndale sayeth by succession into the place and sete of Christ and his apostles, as the scrybes and pharyseys were at Christes cummynge crepte vp into the sete of Moyses / dyd in doctrine & exposicion of scripture, agree with those olde holy doctours and prophetes of euery age and tyme / or els contempned and contraryed them

For he sayd he was sure that he had hys doctryne from heuyn / and that the scrypture what so euer all they sayed, was playne and clere for hym.

For besyde myche other euangelycall auatyce, he tolde vs here, that all be it he sawe golde greate plentye in Tyndals purse / yet coulde he gete but one small pece to go out of Almayne vnto London on hys errande, bothe to sow hys euangelycall sede, & to stele an euangelycall boke out of a poore frerys lybrary / and when he hadde stolen it then brynge it into Almayne to hym. And for all thys long labour of hys goynge, & his besynes of tyllynge and sowynge, and besydes that hys lygyer demayne in stelynge, wherof a man myghte happe to fall to hangynge / he could as he sayd gete of Tyndale no more for all thys gere, but  one poore pece of golde.
                  Now as for makynge of merchaundyse, that saynt Peter speketh of and Tyndale here layeth agaynst the clergy of the catholyke chyrche / what merchaundyse these heretykes make I can not well tell. But thys ys well knowen, that when our euangelycall Englysshe heretykes fall in acquayntaunce beyonde the see wyth some of our merchaū
                     tes factours / they mylke them so euangelycally, that whē theyr maysters call theym home, they gyue theym a very shrewed rekenynge.
                  And surely as all the wordes of saynt Peter with whyche Tyndale here iesteth agaynste the catholyke chyrche, were by saynt Peter spokē agaynst these heretykys onely:

                      so wyll these wordes of hys at laste be verified playne vppon them, in whyche he sayeth that the iudgement ceaseth not, but is redy a good whyle a go agaynste them / & theyr perdycyon slepeth not but waketh and grouneth for them.
                  But as for that that Tyndale sayth, that the clergy crepynge into the seat of Christe and his apostles by successyon, do as the wyly foxe dothe, whose nature is to entre into an hole made with an other beest: I can nat well perceyue what he meneth by his wyly symylytude of the wyly foxe.

And as for theyr wylynes in folowyng the wylynes of the foxe, whose nature is to get hym an hole made with an other beestes labour: he can nat meane any  thyng to the purpose that I can perceyue / but yf he meane to mocke the wordes of our sauiour hym selfe, which sayth to his apostles them selfe, bothe for them selfe and all that shulde by succession in theyr offyce folowe theym that they shuld in a mane

                      folow the nature of the foxe in that fasshion. For he sayde vnto them

                      I haue sente you to repe that that ye laboured not / for other men laboured, and ye haue entred vpon theyr labours.
                  And therfore I can nat dyuyne what mistery Tyndale meaneth by his folowynge of the wyly foxe, whose nature is he sayeth to get hym an hole made with an other bestes labour. Nor I purpose nat to lese y• tyme in musyng what he may meane therby, nor to be so curyouse & inquysytyue as to

How be it in dede suche as cum thense / vnasked saye they do, and comonly can do none other.
                  Now where he sayth that the clergye do entre for onely lucre / he taketh vppon hym to iudge the power of god, in iudgynge euery mannes mynde / but yf he thynke it a sufficient profe that they cum therto for nothyng els, bycause they say nat take away the landes and all the fruites from the benefyce, or els I wyll none of hit.

                  Nay sayth Tyndale. For they gouerne not well, nor do not as saynt Poule saythe, sowe spyrytuall thynges. For they be sayth Tyndale false techers, and do begyle & lede out of the ryght way, all them that haue no loue to folowe and lyue after the truth.
                  Let Tyndale here speke out, and tell vs whyche treuth is that that the people loue not to folow and lyue after / & that therfore god suffereth the clergye to lede them out of the ryght waye far wronge. Thys treuth is good chrysten reader a very false treuth / wherof not onely y• clergy now but thapostles also theym selfe, euer clerely taughte the cō

                  Lo these thynges & such other are the sure tryed truthes ye wote well, that Tyndale wolde haue the people byleue & lyue after / and the spyrytuall thynges whyche he complayneth that the clergy wyll not preche. whych spyrytuall seed bycause they wyll not sowe / he wolde they shold repe none of our carnall corne / nor not onely be rekened vnworthy to receyue as saynt Poule sayth, the dowble auauntage that an other man sholde, but also to receyue so myche by Tyndales wyll, as an othe

                  And yet in this poynte to, the marke that I spake of
                        •
                      of the olde holy sayntes, doth marke these men for heretykes. For these ordynaunces are nat bygon by the clergye that  now is, nor by the clergy of this eyght hūdred yere passed / but hathe ben bygon and continually kepte and obserued
                        •
                      from aboue a thousande yere, ye fourtene hundred yere, ye from the dayes of the apostles them selfe / and bygan also by them selfe, as it not onely doeth appere playne by other autentyque wrytyng, but verely well also by the very scripture it selfe, as I partely haue all redy shewed, and partely shall yet herafter.
                  Than sayth he that the clergye hathe blynded the ryght waye with dōme ceremonyes. yet aske I Tyndale here agayne whiche clergy, and whiche ceremonyes? I saye that in this poynte agayne, the marke that hym selfe made me fynde out, the olde holy doctours and sayntes, marke hym for an heretyke and a lyer bothe.
                  
                     For it is euydent and open, that great parte of the ceremonyes  whiche the chyrche vseth now, were of olde vsed in the tyme of the eldest of them, and before the eldest of them to / and that suche ceremonyes cam from the apostles them selfe. And Tindale neuer brought out yet either boke, lefe, or lyne, to proue vs one wo
                        •
                     de of all his bybyll bable trew, that euer the ceremonyes that he calleth now dūme, spake euer in olde tyme so muche as a mumme, more than they do now. Truthe it is yt men myghte then make allegoryes of them, and so may they now, and so many prechers do, & so doeth that good man that made the booke of Rationale diuinorum / with which kynd of allegoryes Tyndale cummeth furthe in his boke of dysobedyence, in suche a goodly fasshion as it semeth y• but yf the preest alway tell that tale to the people, he wolde haue the people pull the preest from  the auter, and the amys from his hed.
                  But to what purpose he maketh all this brablynge vppon dumme ceremonyes, appereth well vppon the nexte worde after, where he sayth that the chyrche hathe taken away the significacion frō the sacramentes. yet I aske Tyndale agayne which chyrche, and which significacions? Let vs go agayne to our olde marke / and I dare laye a wager with hym, he shall fynde no mo signyfycacions of the sacramentes in the bokes of the eldest of al y• olde holy doctours and sayntes, than I shall fynde hym in the bokes of euery age nowe this two or thre hundred yeres from Eester last passed vpwarde, and so forth in the other ages next aboue that, tyll he cum to the olde tyme of that holy doctour whō so euer hym selfe wyll alledge. And than it well appereth  parde, that the clergy that now is, hath taken away no sygnyfycacyons of the sacramentes at all.
                  we wyll also demaunde of Tyndale, sythe he sayth that the clergy hath taken away the sygnyfycacyons of the sacramentes / whyther were those sygnyfycacyons that they haue takē away, necessary to saluaciō or nat. If they were nat / thenne is there not so greate losse of theym. And on the tother syde yf they were so necessary, that wythout the knowledge of theym the thynges that we be commaunded to do, and whyche we maye nat without disobedyence of good leue vndone, be bycomme noyouse, superstycoyuse, and dampnable / thanne sythe as many suche sygnyfycacyons as be wrytten in the scrypture, do remayne

                      styll and be preched: the tother of whose takyng away Tyndale complayneth beyng necessary for saluacion
to be knowen, were neuer wryten in scrypture.
                        Actuū. 5.
                      And then falsefyeth hym selfe hys owne doctryne, that no such necessary thynge was by thapostles lefte vnwryten.
                  If he saye that mo then haue theyr specyall sygnyfycacyons wryten in scrypture, be not necessary: therin wyll not onely the marke that we spake of of the olde holy sayntes, marke hym for an heretike / but so wyll the very scrypture to, by whyche it appereth that all the seuyn sacramentes were by god gyuen to hys chyrche, as thynges by goddes instytucyon necessary for mannys saluacyon / in suche wyse at the lest wyse as the neglectynge and contempte of the grace that god geueth in theym, is able to brynge the  dyspyser to dampnacyon.
                  But it appereth clerely what holy purpose Tyndale hath in thys mater. For he speketh not so myche of the sygnyfycacyons, for any ca

                  And in thys wyse wolde he make vs wene, that for the sacramētes we were neuer the better / and that to take them for any other thynge then a bare token, and to thynke that the blessed sacrament of the aulter were the very body and bloude of Cryste, or any thynge ellys then wyne and cake  brede set vp for a bare sygne, as a tauerners busshe or tapysters a

Is nat this doctryne of suche bylyefe and trust in good workes so peryllouse, that rather than men myght be the rather drawen into good workes therwith, Tyndale sholde make vs take all the seuē sacramentes and caste them clene awaye / whych he sayth in mo places then one, be now not onely frutelesse, but also harmfull and perilouse? In whyche poynt euery man marketh well, that yet agayne the marke that we spake of, the comē consent of the olde holy doctours and sayntes, marke thys man for a very myscheuouse heretyque.

                  Now where he sayeth that the clergye vseth to dystroye the lyterall sense of the scrypture wyth false fayned allegoryes / this is falsely sayd of hym. For the allegorye neyther destroyeth nor letteth the lyterall sense / but ye lyterall sense standeth whole bysyde.

For I am sure he shall not lyghtely fynde any of those olde, but that he vsed allegoryes.
                  Luther and Tyndale wolde haue all allegoryes and all other senses taken awaye, sauynge the lytterall sense alone.

                  But yet saw saynte Poule, that god so myche cared for the prestes leuynge, aboue that he careth for the oxes leuynge / that in respecte of the tone compared wyth the tother,

And I wene Tyndale is euen angre wyth saynte Poule for that exposycyon.
                  Now are there many other textes in the olde law, which in lyke wyse receyue lyke exposycyon, by goodly and frutefull allegoryes, as in the olde holy saynts bokes appereth. All whych will Tyndale here haue wyped oute in any wise and wyll haue none allegoryes at all.

                  Go me now thorow all these poyntes agayn, that Tyndale hath vnder the name of the clergy, layed agaynste the catholyke chyrche, crepynge vp in to thapostles place respecte

of lucre, ledynge in a wronge way, begylynge the  people, makynge of constytucyons, vsynge of ceremonyes takynge away the sygnyfycacyons of sacramētes, and makynge of false gloses / and ye shall fynde good chrysten reders of all these fautes that they falsely ley to our charge, theyr owne bosoms full.
                  For theyr archeheretykes accompte theym selfe for the prechers, and chalenge the apostles place, not by succession but by inuasyon. For they go and preache and be not sent / and though pryde prykke them forth wyth lybertye to lechery, yet not wythout lucre neyther. For some one of them puttynge oute hys felowes such as wyll be religyouse and contynue chaste, kepeth all theyr leuynge alone, sauynge for an harlot taken vnto hym to be called hys wyfe, and gete vppe a couent of bastardes betwene theym / and then  they begyle the people wyth theyr false preachynge, & lede them a very wronge way excepte the strayght wey to hell be the ryght waye to heuen.
                  Now as for cōstytucyons wherof they wold haue none amonge vs / theym selfe haue ben fayne in some cytyes of Almayne as late as they be bygonne, to make mo constytucyons and more bourdenouse to the people, more greuous and more sore to kepe vppe theyr heresyes wyth, then the chyrche hath made in many yeres to kepe vp the trew chrysten fayth.
                  Ceremonyes also whyche amonge vs they mokke and call them dūme / Marten Luther hym self Tyndales great mayster, after that he had lefte theym of, was by the profe and experyence dreuen lytle and lytle to take them almoste  euerychone vppe agayne, sauynge fastynge lo. For that ceremonye frere Luther wyll none in no wyse, le

                  Now touchynge the sacramentes, where of they say the chyrche hath taken away the sygnyfycacyons / these heretykes take from theym all the thynge whyche they chiefly sygnyfye, that is to say, the grace inuisyble that god geueth wyth them, and wherof he maketh them an effectuall tokē and instrument.
                  And ouer this of the seuen they take away fyue quyte, & leue the tother twayne frutelesse / and from the tone take they the swete carnell wythin, the blessed body of Chryste, and leue the people the shalys.
                  
                     
                      Then as for truste in workes / the catholyque chyrche scantely teacheth so bolde trust in abstynēce, almoyse dede, prayour, and chastyte, as theyr archeheretyques teache in glotony, spoilyng of chyrches, despyte of all holowes, and in relygyouse lechery.
                  Fynally for makyng of false gloses / them selfe do mych more then that. For they where they lyste boldely deny the texte / and wyll take for scrypture but what they lyst theym selfe / for so reiecte they dyuerse partes whyche the whole catholyque chyrche doth receyue / and so myghte they by the same reason reiecte the remanaunt to, and so they wyll I wene at laste, and some haue done all redy.
                  And then as for false gloses, they make theym selfe the worst that euer were wroughte. As Luther to make men  wene that matrymony were no sacrament / where the kynges hyghnes as a moste erudyte prynce and a moste faythfull kyng, in his moste famouse boke amonge many other great authorytees & reasons, preced hym sore wyth that that the gloryouse apostle saynte Poule calleth yt a great sacrament hym self:
                        Ephes. 5.
                      Luther I say, letteth not in this wyse to glose saynte Poules wordes, and say that saynte Poule peraduenture sayed yt of his owne hed.
                  Is not there an hamer hed more mete to make horshone in hell, then to constre the scrypture in erth, that is so harde as to make such gloses to that gloryouse apostles wordes? wherin who so lyst to folow Tyndale, maye set at short all that thapostle teacheth / and say he sayd that but of his own mynde, and not accordynge to the mynde of god.
                  
                      And yet syth this is Luthers owne glose, and his owne answere vnto other men: Luther hym selfe and Tyndale also, and all his other dyscyples, myght well and wythout blasphemy be answered wyth the same in all the harde places of saynt Poule wyth theyr false glosynge, wherof they wold destroy the fre wyll of man, & lay the weyght of theyr owne synnys to the charge of goddes ineuytable prescyēs, and theyr owne ineuitable destynye.

                     I wote nere also what he meaneth by generall artycles /  for we call generall articles those that y• generall chyrch byleueth / and specyall, those that be byleued but of some specyall folke. If he wolde take yt thus, this wold ease mych of the matter.
                  But now I can not tell whyche he calleth generall artycles. For the generall chyrch calleth those parte of the generall artycles, whyche artycles Tyndale sayth be false & no parte of the fayth at all.
                  yet where he sayth such generall artycles as thou fyndest in the scrypture, he muste tell vs onys agayne, whych thou. For betwene the chyrch and hys sectys yt is not fully agreed, whyche bokes be the trewe scrypture. For frere Barns sayth playne, that saynt Iamys pystle is none of his. And frere Luther sayth the same, and setteth not mych  therby, though he wyste well yt were his in dede / and so the sectes take not all for scrypture, that the catholyque chyrche dothe.
                  Nowe where he speketh of the samples gone afore / he muste bothe tell vs whych ensamples he meaneth, and apply those ensamples also to his present purpose.
                  And whē he hath so done / then shall ye well see that they s

                     all as all his other markes do, but yf we byleue the comē knowen catholyque chyrche, shew ellys no certaynty of any chyrche at all / but one chyrche to one sorte and a nother chyrch to a nother, and fynally as many sundry chyrches, as there be sondry sectes of heretyques.
                  And syth not onely no secte agreeth with other, but almost also no man amonge theym all wyth other: all Tyndales  markes be so dyuerse to so many, y• they must nedes shewe almost as many dyuerse chyrches, as there are gone owte of the knowen catholyke chyrche not onely dyuerse sectes, but also dyuerse menne.
                  And agaynst this hath Tyndale none euasyon that can well serue hym / but onely one. And that is, yf he saye that he meneth all his doutfull wordes to be expowned by him selfe / that is to saye, that he meaneth by scrypture well vnderstanden, the scrypture so vnderstanden as hym selfe vnderstandeth yt / and by playne placys, those places that he calleth playne hym selfe / and by generall artycles, those artycles that he calleth generall hym selfe / & that he calleth founden in scrypture, all those artycles and onely those,

                      that he sayth he fyndeth there hym self / and ensamples byfore gone, those ensamples onely that hym selfe lyste to assygne, and so applyed as hym selfe lyste to applye them.
                  And surely yf he meane thus / thys wyll som set an ende in the mater, and shortely ceace all the stryfe, yf all folke agree to folow hym / and ellys be we styll yet at as greate stryfe as we were before.
                  And yet yf he so mene, what nedeth he so longe processe. For then amoūteth all hys tale to no more, but as though he myghte saye, wyll ye knowe whyche is the very chyrch? Surely the very chyrche is euyn whych so euer chyrch my selfe lyste to tell you. And this were ye wote well soone and shortely sayde, and were a very godly conclusyon.

                  Now where Tyndale sayth to make vp hys mater with in thys wyse, we departe fro them vnto the trewe scrypture, and vnto the fayth and lyuynge therof and rebuke them / in lyke maner he bryngeth forth now for hys parte another maner thyng in dede then

                      euer he spake of yet. For he sayde wythin thre lynes before, that we haue the scrypture of Cryste and hys apostles, and are for all that fallen from the fayth and lyuynge of them, and are become heretikes, and therfore haue nede of Iohn̄ Baptyste to conuerte vs. Now syth we haue as Tyndale hym selfe here confesseth vs to haue the scrypture of Cryste and hys apostles: whyther wyll Tyndale go frome vs to seke the trewe scrypture? Taketh he the scrypture of Cryst and hys apostles for a false scrypture? He wyl of lykelyhed leue the chrysten countrees and the scryptures of Cryste, & gete hym into Turkay and take hym to Machomettes alcharon, and call that the trewe scrypture / or ellys hath Luther and he some other scrypture in close, whyche he calleth here the trewe scrypture.
                  
                      And surely so it semeth they haue. For I am very sure that by our scrypture whyche hym selfe here confesseth for the scrypture of Cryste & hys apostles, he shall neuer whyle he lyueth be able to proue frere Luthers lechery any good lawfull matrymony.
                  And where he sayth he goeth frow vs to the faythe and liuynge therof / he muste nedes meane some fayth and lyuynge that is allowed by that same trewe scrypture that he speketh of / that is as it semeth by hys wordes, none of Crystes scrypture nor of hys apostles. And therfore when so euer he luste hereafter to leue of our scryptures, that is as he confesseth the scrypture of Chryste and hys apostles, and medle no more wyth them, as it were well done he dyd not, & onys I wene he wyll not i

                      to whyche he sayth they go nowe, and whyche he calleth the trewe scrypture: we wyll then aske hym wherby he can proue theyr new foūde scrypture more trewe then the scrypture of Cryste and hys apostles, which hym selfe confesseth to be wyth the catholyke chyrche / and whyche as it hath alwaye bene therwyth, so shall alwaye remayne therwyth after Tyndale and all that euer wyll walke oute thereof to seke theym selfe some new.
                  Then sayth he farther, And we rebuke them in lyke maner / that is to saye that saynte Luther, saynte Huchyns, saynt Huyskyns, and saynte Swynglius, in lyke wyse rebuke the catholyque chyrche, as faynte Iohn̄ Baptyste rebuked the synagoge of the Iewes.
                  
                     But now muste Tyndale remembre fyrste, that though  we were all as well worthy to be rebuked as euer was any of them / nor for out lyuynge onely, but for our bylief also: yet were not these bestes such men as yt myght so well become in lyke maner to rebuke vs, as yt myght saynte Iohan Baptyste to rebuke the Iewes / both for that he was an holy man and fawtelesse, and therfore merely to fynde and rebuke fautes / and also bycause he was specyally sent by god to rebuke fautes / where as these m

                  And besyde this these folke rebuke vs not in lyke maner. For saynt Iohn̄ Baptyste rebuked the vices of the Iewes, not wyth wordes onely but specyally wyth the sample of his owne vertuous liuyng / where as these rebukers of oure lyuynge,

                  Saynt Iohn̄ also preached penaunce for synne / but these felowes kepe styll theyr owne synnys them selfe, and call them vertue, and auow the breke of theyr vow for well  done, and theyr lechery for matrymony, & call euyll good and good euyll, whyte blakke and blakke whyte / & teache men to contemne penaunce, and make men abhorre confessyon, and thynke that lytle sorow suffyseth, and satysfaccy to nede none at all, but great synne to go aboute yt.
                  Thys was not saynte Iohn̄s maner.
                  Saynte Iohn̄ shewed an nother maner of penaunce, exhortynge to confessyon and harty contrycyon. And how a penytēt shold lyue he declared in his lyuyng / not that he so neded, but to teache wyth his dede that he preached wyth hys worde.
                  Saynt Iohn̄ therfore lyu

Thys was not the maner of rebukyng y• saynt Iohn̄ vsed. And therfore Tyndale sayth vntrewe when he sayth they rebuke vs after the same maner that saynt Iohn̄ dyd the Iewys.
                  But now knytteth Tyndale all the mater vp / and shortely sheweth in the ende of this chapyter euyn in a few wordes, the thynge that he hath made vs gape after all thys  whyle, sythe the begynnynge of hys whole boke, that is to wytte whyche is the very chyrche. For lo syr thus he sayth.
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     And as they whyche departe from the fayth of the trewe chyrche are heretykes / euyn so they whyche departe from the chyrche of heretykes and fals fayned fayth of ypocrites, are the trew chyrche.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Lo good chrysten readers after longe worke at laste, Tyndale hath here in few wordes shewed you whyche is the very trewe chyrche / that is to saye as many as departe out of the chyrche of heretykes.
                  But hath not Tyndale now brough

                     syderynge that the questyon is asked for none other cause then onely to knowe whyche be the heretykes that are the counterfeted chyrches.
                  And now gyueth Tyndale suche a counsayle, as yf one that coulde no good skylle of money and were sette to be a receyuour, wolde aske hym counsayle how he sholde do to be sure alwaye to to take good money / and Tyndale wold aduyse hym to se well that he toke no badde. And then yf he sayd agayne, ye M. Tyndale but I praye you teche me then how I may be sure that I take no badde. Mary wold Tyndale say agayne, for that shall I teche the a way sure inough, that neuer shall deceyue the yf thou do as I bydde the, what is that I pray you. Mary loke in any wyse that

thou take none but good.
                  
                  Suche a good lesson lo dyd the tylar onys teache the mayde, how she sholde bere home water in a syue and spyll neuer a droppe. And when she brought the syue to the water to hym to lerne yt / he bade her do no more but ere euer she put in the water, stoppe faste all the holes.
                  And then the mayde laughte and sayde that she coulde yet teache hym a thynge that a man of his crafte had more nede to lerne. For she coulde teache hym how he sholde neuer fall, clymed he neuer so hygh, all though mē toke away the lader from hym. And when he longed to lerne y• poynt to saue his nekke wyth / she bode hym do no more but euer se surely to one thynge, that is to wytte, that for any haste he neuer come downe faster then he went vppe. Now such a good sure lesson Tyndale teacheth vs here. For nowe to  make vs sure alwaye whyche is the chyrche, he telleth vs that they be the chyrche that come from heretyques / where as the very trew chyrche standyng in questyon, heretykes, that is to saye the counterfete false chyrche, muste nedys stande in the lyke questyon, and be as doutefull as the tother. And therfore hath Tyndale in this tale so soyled all the doute, that he hath lefte all euen in lyke doute styll.
                  Nowe yf Tyndale wyll saye that he hath all redy well & suffycyētly shewed who be heretykes, in that he hath shewed whyche was onys the ryght chyrch, that is to wyt Criste and his apostles / and that the catholyke chyrche that now is, is fallen from the fayth and bylyefe of that chyrch that then was, and so be they the heretyques / and therfore the chyrch that was, sheweth the heretykes that be / that is say the chyrche of Chryst and his apostles that was the chyrh  well knowen, do shewe the catholyque chyrche that now is for well knowen heretykes / and therfore Tyndale and Luther, and all theyr felowes, syth they be a company well knowen to haue goone oute and lefte for hatered of theyr false fayth and heresyes this knowen catholyque chyrche of here
                        •
                     ykes: yt muste nedes folow, that Luther and Tyndale, and Huyskyn, and Swynglius, and theyr company, be the very chyrche. And so this questyon surely soyled by Tyndale, and openly and playnly without any such doute remanynge therin as is spoken of byfore / and the tylar nedeth not nowe to loke to hys fete at all, he can not fall though he wolde.
                  
                     
                      Consyder now good reader that yf Tyndale make this answere (for as for other that he myght make, as helpe me god yf I saw yt, I wolde my selfe make yt for hym as effectuall as I coulde) but as I say yf he make vs thys, consyder well then that the whole effecte and pyth of this answere is nothynge elles, but that the knowen catholyque chyrche from whych Tyndale cōfesseth hym selfe that they be gone as from heretykes, and whych knowen catholyke chyrche we call the trew chyrch, be fallen frō the trew fayth of Chryste & his apostles, and be by that meanes become heretyques.
                  And in this poynte though Tyndale to blere oure yien wyth all, vse dyuerse ways to draw our myndes from the very poynt of the mater / and to flater the temporalty, tourneth  all his tale and his raylynge wordes agaynst the clergye: yet in very dede the whole bodye of the chyrche is the thynge that he heweth at, and that he calleth the heretikes. For of spyrytualty and temporalty all is one fayth / and of the whole catholyque chyrche hath from the begynnynge euer ben our mater.
                  Then consyder I say now, that where he sayth that the catholyque chyrche now is fallen from the fayth of the old chyrche of Chryste and his apostles / we can not denye but that Tyndale so sayth. But then se we well and so we saye agayne and saye therin very trewe, that when Tyndale so sayth he lyeth.
                  For ye se your selfe that Tyndale proueth thys tale but by hys bare worde, 
                        •
                     n that we byleue not as he doth, that  good workes are naught worth, and that the sacraments be gracelesse and but bare sygnes and tokens / and yet not so myche neyther by Tyndales tale, but onely dumme ceremonyes that neyther say nor sygnyfye, and that men do wronge to worshyppe the body and blood of Cryste in the blessed sacrament, and that there is nothynge therin but very bare brede and wyne or starch in stede of brede / & that freres may well wedde nūnys, and such other goodly thynges lyke. whyche false artycles to be trew, he neyther hath proued nor can proue whyle he lyueth, nor all ye heretykes in this world, nor yet all the deuyls in hell.
                  Now haue we well proued you, that in all suche poyntes we haue the selfe same fayth that Cryste and hys apostles had and tawght. And in these poyntes we proue that

the scrypturys of them be on our parte. And yet saye we  also that we be sure therof, by that that Cryste and hys apostles dyd delyuer vs these thynges by mouthe besyde the wrytynge / by whyche we sholde also haue bene sure therof, all though they neuer hadde ben wryten / as we be by that meane sure of some other thynges that were lefte vnwrytē, and onely delyuered by Chryste to hys apostles, and by his apostles to the chyrche, and therin perpetually kept by the spyryte of god, that Cryste accordynge to his promyse sent vnto his chyrche to lede it in to all trouth,

                  But as I beganne to saye, remembre good reader that where as we saye that in the greate varyaunce of oure faythes, the fayth I saye of the catholyque chyrche and the fayth whyche these heretyques professe to the contrary, we proue our fayth by the scryptures / and they saye naye, and afferme that they proue theyrs by y• scryptures, wherunto  we saye naye: all the questyon for the more parte ryseth, or hath at the leste wyse euer hytherto rysen, not vppon the scrypture selfe, but vppon the construccyon thereof / that is to saye not whyther the wordes were holy scrypture or no that were for scrypture alledged, but what was of that scrypture the trewe sense and ryghte vnderstandynge.

                      Fynally good chrysten reders vppon these thynges it foloweth, that we proue well and suffycyently, that there is not an olde chyrche of Cryste and hys apostles, & an other newe chyrche now / but one whole chyrche from that tyme to thys tyme in one trewe fayth contynued. And so is it playnely proued false all the fundacyon of Tindals whole tale.
                  And as for any thynge that hym selfe proueth / hys wordes that he wold were taken for so playne to shewe vs whyche is the chyrche, leueth vs as I sayed in lyke dowte as we were / sauynge where they shold proue hym & his cō
                     pany the chyrche, they proue nowe clerely wyth thys, that he confesseth Cryste & hys apostles to haue ben the chyrch / and then this that we proue therto by all the holy doctours  bokes of euery age before, that the catholyke chyrche hath now the same fayth styll, and Tyndale and hys felowes ye contrary: Tyndals owne tale I saye wyth these thynges set therto, proue Tyndale and all his felowes heretykes, and the knowen catholyke chyrche to be the very chyrche of Cryste.
                  And here ye se well good reders, I myghte of hys chapyter make an ende. But in good fayth Tyndals wordes well wayed, haue so many mery folyes in them, that I can not yet holde my fyngers from them.
                  For I requyre you for goddes sake onys agayne consyder hys wordes well.
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     
                     As they which depart from the fayth of the true chyrch are heretykes / euen so they that departe from the chyrche of heretykes and false fayned fayth of ypochrytes, are the trewe chyrche.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  I haue in good fayth good hope, that there shall not lyghtely so meane a wytted man rede his wordes here, but that he shall meruayle myche where Tyndals wytte was when he wrote those wordes. For euery chyld may se perde that these two thynges be not lyke / that is to wytte the goynge out of the trewe chyrche of Cryste, and the goyng out of the false chyrche of heretykes. For the trewe chyrche of Cryste is but one. And the false chyrches of heretykes be many. And therfore though euery man that goth from the

faith out of that one trew chyrch of Crist, must nedes be an  heretyke, bycause he can not so go out but by heresye / it foloweth not that in lyke wyse euery man that goeth oute of the chyrche of heretykes, goeth into the trewe chyrche of Cryste, by the trewe fayth agayne / for as mych as of many chyrches, he maye go out of one into another / and so ye se well they do. And therfore Tyndale speketh false Englysh when he sayth the chyrche of heretykes. For they neyther be any one chyrch, nor haue any one chyrche ouer them all, so specyall that it maye be by a certayne specyall preemynens in respecte of the remanaunt called the chyrche.
                  Now that a man maye go out of a false chyrche of heretykes and yet not into the trewe chyrche of Cryst / Tyndale maye well perceyue by two samples of two specyall heretykes of two contrary condycyons / that is to wytte one heretyke  of olde called Berengarius, and an other of new called wyllyam Hychyn. Berengarius fell fyrst into that fals heresye agaynste the blessed sacrament of the aulter, that he affermed and helde that there is not in it the very body of Cryste, nor nothynge but onely very brede, and gathered hys chyrche of his heresye togyther. But afterwarde he better remembred hym selfe, and reuoked that heresye, and fell from that heresy into an other / not fully so farre in falshed but yet a false heresye to / that is to wytte that heresye that Luther holdeth now, that in the sacrament though he confessed to be the very body of Cryste, yet he helde that there remayned and abode styll very brede to therwyth.
                  And thus in Berengarius may Tyndale well perceyue that a man may go frow a false chyrche of heretykes, and yet not strayt into the trewe chyrche of Cryste.
                  
                  Tyndale maye also perceyue thys poynte well by the tother new heretyke wyllyam Huchyn, whych fyrste fell to the secunde heresye that was of the twayne the lesse euyll, that is to wyt the heresye that Luther holdeth, that in the sacrament is bothe the very body of Cryst and very brede. But now eyther bycause he longed euer to falle vnto the wurste, as longe as he myght fynde any wurse then other, or ellys bycause he fauored frete Huskyn, bycause his own name was Huchyn / he fell in that poynt from Luthers heresye to hys, and affermeth now that there is in the blessed sacrament nothynge ellys but brede / and 
                        •
                     esteth and scoffeth vpon it, and dysputeth in hys blasphemy that it shold

                      be but starche.
                  And thus where the olde heretyke Berengarius began at the worste, and from that fell to lesse euyll: this new heretyque Huchyn goth contrary way, begynnynge at the lesse euyll and fallynge from that vnto the worse. And therfore is mych the lesse lykely to folow yt tother in one poynt, in whyche I praye god he may. For Berengarius yet after all thys, reuoked his later heresye to, and lyued longe after, and dyed an holy vertuouse man.
                  But by these ensamples I say Tyndale may well perceyue that though he go strayt out of a chirch of heretikes, yet yt shall not folow yt he shall go into ye trew chyrch / syth he maye by the waye steppe into a nother false chyrche, of whyche there be so many besyde.
                  
                      For all the heretyques be not gathered into one chyrch / but as the chyrche of Cryste is but one, so be there of those a vengable many / and be not cōprehended vnder any one chyrch, sauyng onely that as the trew chyrch is the chyrch of god, so be all the false called the chyrch of ye deuyll,

                      whyche is kynge as the scripture sayth ouer all the chyldren of pryde, whyche pryde is as saynte Austayne sayth the very moder of heretyques.
                  Now yf yt be trewe that Tyndale here sayeth, that the chyrche whyche we call the very chyrche / that is to say, yf yt be trew that the catholyque knowen chyrche, be as Tyndale here taketh yt the chyrche of heretyques / and ye fayth therof be as he also calleth yt, a false fayned fayth of ypocrytys / and therfore lyke as thys chyrche bycause yt is as  he sayth comen awaye from the trew chyrche of Cryste and hys apostles, is the chyrche of false heretykes / so they that come awaye fro this chyrch of heretykes, and this false fayned fayth of ypocritys, be the trew chyrch: then must yt nedys folowe, that all the sectys whyche are sprongen in Boheme, and in Sarony, & in some other partes of Almayn, be the very trew chyrche, and the trew faythfull byleuers.
                  Now syth Tyndale hath brought yt vnto this, I wold fayn know one thyng of hym / syth it is so that all those sectys be the trew chyrch and very faythfull folke: how happeth yt that eche of theym calleth other false shrewes, and sayth trew in that poynt and in allmoste nothynge ellys?

                  More.
                  Nowe consyder good reder whether these tokens do make vs know, that all the sectes that are departed fro the catholyke chyrche, be the trew chyrche.
                  How can theyr fayth examyned by the scripture, or how can theyr professyon to lyue accordyng to the lawis of gos, make vs perceyue that all they be the trew chyrch, bycause they come from the fayth of oures whych Tyndale calleth false and fayned / where as they beyng departed from owres, do amonge them selfe neyther in fayth nor in professyon of lyuynge any wyse consent or agree?
                  For fyrste in Boheme, what a sorte of dyuerse false faythys be there, and what dyuersyte and contraryete in the professyon of theyr lyuynge.
                  Then in Saxony and in some partes of Almayn, what a nother sorte is there of sundry maner sectis, as well in artycles of the fayth and bylyefe, as iu the vnmanerly maners and lawles lawes of lyuynge, wherof ye may perceyue a great many by the boke of M. wyllyam Barloo, that longe was cōuersaunt in the countrey / whych detestynge thabomynacyon that he founde amonge theym, hath of a ryght godly zele geuen vs knowlege of theym.
                  And now by Tyndales tale they be the trew chyrch euery  chone, and the lawe of god shall allowe all theyr lyuynges as bestely as they be, and the scrypture of god shall vpholde and maynteyn all theyr belyefes as dyssonaunt and as repugnaūt as they be eche to other, and as malycyousely false as all the whole sorte be both one and other.
                  For all this lo yet shall we by the law of god and by the scrypture of god compared with all theyr bestely lyuynges and all theyr false repugnaunt faythes, well and clerely know sayth Tyndale, that all they be the very trew chyrch of Cryste, bycause they can be none other, for as myche as they be come away from the fayned fayth of ours.
                  And so ye may se that Tyndale affyrmeth now not onely those abhomynable heresyes that he taught before, but

                      all those also the Anabaptistes haue added vnto them synnys. And so now be the trewe chyrche wyth hym and agree wyth scrypture and wyth the lawe of god, all those that say the baptysynge of chyldren is voyde, and they that say that there ought to be no rulers at all in crystendome, neyther spyrytuall nor temporall / and that no man shold haue any thynge proper of his owne, but that all landes and all goodes ought by goddes lawe to be all mennys in comen, and that all women ought to be comen to all men, as well the nexte of kynne as the farthest straunger, & euery man husbande to euery woman, and euery woman wyfe vnto euery man / and then fynally that our blessed sauyour Crist was but onely man and not god at all.
                  And in good fayth I neuer thought other yet from sone  after the begynnynge, but that when these folke fell onys to these horryble heresyes whyche Tyndale in his bokes hath taught vs, they shulde not fayle to fall sone after vnto these other to / of whych the very worste is not worse yet then dyuerse of those that Tyndale taught vs byfore / nor lyghtly can there none be worse, excepte onely one, that were to say there is no god at all. And as helpe me god I veryly fere they shall fall vnto that at laste. And then rekenynge neyther vppon god nor deuyll nor immortalyte of theyr owne soules, but iestynge and scoffynge that god is a good felow, & as good a soule hath an oule as a cukkoo, and whē thou seest my soule hange on the hedge then hurle stonys at yt hardly and spare not / and as Tyndale sayth when thou spekest with saint Peter, then pray hym to pray  for the: thus rekenynge vpon nothynge but onely vppon this world, & therfore rekkyng for nothyng but onely for y• body, they shall at the laste fall in a new rage, & gather thē selfe to gyther, and shall but yf theyr malyce be the better repressed, to make other maner maystryes then euer they made ye
                        •
                      / wherof the myschiefe shall fall in theyr own nekkes. But yet yf they may be suffred onys to ryse
                        •
                      all the myschyefe wyll not fall in theyr owne nekkes alone, but mych harme shall happe vppon many good mennys heddes ere these rebellyous wreches be well repressyd agayne.
                  Besyde all this, consyder well good reder, that yf yt be trew that Tyndale here teacheth vs for the fynall conclusyon of all this chapyter / that is to wit yf it be trew that all they that go oute of the catholyke chyrche, be the the trewe

chyrche / then syth the sectes that are departed oute of thys  catholyque chyrche, be companyes knowen well ynough, ye se nowe very well that here hath Tyndale sodenly destroyed and pulled downeth chyrche that all thys whyle he went about to byeld vppe / whyche was as fro the begynnynge ye haue herde, a chyrche of vnknowen electys. For he hath as ye now perceyue, brought al to a knowē chyrch, or rather to twenty knowen chyrches / of whych euery one is by all the remenaunt knowleged to be knowen for false / and then bothe in abomynable false bylyefe and brutyshe bestely lyuynge all the whole rable suche, that obstynately lyue therin, and deuelyshly also dye therin, that euery man may well perceyue they can not all be goddes electys.
                  And thus hath he sodaynly pulled here downe to groūd, the chyrche vnknowen of his onely electys, that he hathe  good crysten reder all this whyle so bysely gone aboute to sette vppe.
                  Now yf Tyndale when he shall perceyue howe blyndely the deuyll hath led hym here aboute, and made hym to fall in the dyche with his docer, & breke all his eggys, & quayle thus all his conclusyon, wolde for shame seke any farther shyfte, & say that I mysse take hys wordes, & that hym self ment in them some other maner thynge: I dowte not but euery wyse reder wyll cōsyder well what he wyll saye, and not be so far ouer sene as to byleue hym at his onely word. One thynge I am very sure, that I haue in this chapyter lefte neuer a word of his vnwrytē to hyde his entent, or depraue his purpose wyth all / but haue truely and playnely rehersed them euery one. By all whyche yt appereth playnly, that he both sayth and meaneth as I haue shewed you /  and therupon that these folyes of his that I haue declared you, are playnely deduced vppon his own wordes whyche I haue rehersed you.
                  Howe be yt yf he wyll for auoydyng of the shame, surmyse yt he ment some other thyng: I can not well ymagyn what yt myght be that he myght dyuyse to say that he mēt. For yf he wold say that he ment not, that all the sectys that go oute of the catholyque chyrche whych he calleth the heretykes be the trew chyrche / but some one of them, whyche one we sholde perceyue well from the remenaunt by theyre fayth examyned by scrypture, & by the professyon of theyr lyuynge after the law of god: this can he not saye that he

                      ment / for he nameth no one secte of them all, but sayth generally that they whyche departe out of the chyrche of heretykes whyche he calleth the comen knowen catholyke chyrche, be the trew chyrche. And therfore he can not escape so.
                  He wold also yf he had so ment, haue specyally cōmaūded some one. And also there is not one of thē all whose fayth eyther agreeth wyth the scrypture, or the professyō of theyr liuyng with the law of god / but yf Tyndale call as in dede he doth, a godly professyon for freres & nonnes to fall from the chastyte of theyr professyon / and lyke as they professed before to serue god in chastyte, so to professe them self from hense forth to serue the deuyll in sacrylege, and make hym a dayly sacryfyce of theyr owne bestely bodyes wyth incestuous lecherye.
                  
                      Fynally yf he be so shamelesse as to say that he ment none of them all, but some suche vnknowen as hym selfe woteth not whom, that is gone out of our chyrch, that is to wytte the knowen catholyke chyrche / & byleueth not as we do by cause we byleue nought / nor lyueth not as we do bycause we lyue nought / nor goth not into any of those other chyrches & sectes neyther, bycause they byleue nought and lyue nought also as wel as we, but frame them selfe some fayth after the scrypture, & some kynde of lyuyng after the lawe of god by them selfe / & that these be the very chyrche & the very electes, & all vnknowen both who they be and where they be sauing onely that alway som such there be, & knowē onely to god that hath elected them, & euery of them to hym selfe by hys felyng fayth, which yet he many tymes feleth  nothynge of, as Tyndale hym selfe hath before cōfessed in the chapyter of the order of theyr eleccyō, & yet for all that alway feleth styll, yt thorow the felyng fayth which he ones felt, he is one of goddes good chyldern, euyn whyle he lyeth with his lēman or whyle he kylleth a good man, & that in all that whyle yt he doth such deuelysshe dedes, he doeth yet no dedely synne: yf he can for shame fynde in hys harte to say thus, this wylbe the most folysh thynge of all.
                  For fyrst the generall maner yt he vseth where he sayth They that go fro the chyrche of heretykes (whyche he calleth vs of the catholyke chyrch) be the very chyrche, This generall maner of speche I say that excludeth none, restrayneth it not vnto a fewe folke onely vncertayne & vnknowē, but extendeth it vnto all folke that euer go forth frō vs. And therfore he cā not excuse his foly with sayeng that he ment it so.
                  
                     Moreouer yf he so had ment in dede / that had bene yet  the moste foly of all. For what cōgregacyon were that whiche neuer were gathered togyder, nor neuer one parte wyttyngly speke wyth other / of whych yf they mette to gyther, neuer one knoweth other. For though they knowe to gyther, as folke of acquayntaunce or kyn

                     ed, or neyghbours peraduenture all of one towne or strete, ye or of one house eyther: yet can they not one knowe an other as for a member of hys owne vnknowen chyrch, that is to wytte for one of the trewe fayth and ryght lyuynge, & for a penytent synner, and fynally for a fynall electe. And all these condyciōs ye wote well muste those persons haue that Tyndale taketh for the very chyrche.
                  yes sayth Tyndale Thou shalte alwaye knowe them by theyr fayth examyned by the scrypture, and by theyr professyo
                           •
                         and consent to lyue accordynge  vnto the lawes of god.
                  
                  How is it possyble to know by these menes whyther he be a fynall electe or not? whyle he may both lye & chaunge, and say he byleueth otherwyse than he doth, or byleue here after otherwyse than he doth now.
                  But yet consyder well here good reder, that when ye se Tyndale here go about to teche how they may be knowē / he declareth hym selfe that of reason the chyrche muste be a chyrche knowen / and that it were a thynge farre out of reason to haue the very chyrch vnknowen. And in thys he clerely declareth the madnesse as well of hym selfe as of Luther & Bar

                     e he lyueth, all though the reason had no more then he reherseth: yet doth the kynges grace agaynste Luther besydes all thys that Tyndale reherseth, put an other pyece or twayne of pytthe and strength therin.
                  For where as in the tyme of holy saynt Austayne, suche heretykes as then were, played as these do now, denyenge the comon knowen catholyke chyrche to be the very chyrche of god, and the doctryne therof to be trewe: that blessed  doctour amonge many other thynges wyth whyche he playnely confuted that folysshe heresye
                        •
                      sayed and affermed playnely that hym self sholde not haue byleued the gospell, but yf the authoryte of the catholyke chyrche compelled hym therunto.
                  Thys sayenge of saynt Austayne Luther hym selfe alloweth. For though he wyll in no wyse agree, that the hole catholyke chyrch gathered to gyther in a generall coūsayl, hath any authoryte or powre to make any lawes at all: yet he graunteth that the certaynty by which we knowe and be put in suretye, whyche is the very scrypture of god, and whyche not, a man hath hys lernyng and teachyng of that poynte by the chyrche of god, for the chyrche hath sayth Luther accordynge to the sayenge of Austayne, thys thynge  geuen it of god, that it can iudge and dyscerne the wordes of god from the wordes of men.
                  Then layed oure sayde souerayne lorde Luthers owne wordes agaynste Luthers owne heresyes, for the faythe of the catholyke chyrche, in dyuers places dyuers wayes. For syth Luther confessed that the chyrche hath that gyfte of god, that it can dyscerne the word of god from the word of man: it foloweth sayeth hys grace that those thynges whyche the chyrche sayeth, is the worde of god vnwryten and tradycyons of the apostles, (of whyche Luther wolde none byleue, bycause they were not wryten) be the very worde of god as well as those that be wryten.
                  And in that reason hys grace gaue Luther & Tyndale

and all theyr whole secte such a sure fall, that they shall neuer  well aryse and walke vp ryght whyle they lyue agayn. For as hys hyghnes layed vnto hym, syth Luther can not saye nay but that he must byleue the chyrch when it telleth hym that these thynges god caused hys apostles to wryte / wherfore must he not as mych byleue it, whē it telleth hym These thynges god caused hys apostles to tell and teche by mouth? Then layed his hyghnes vnto Luther ferther, his owne wordes agaynst hym selfe this wyse.
                  Luther hym selfe confesseth yt god hath gyuen the chyrche that gyfte, that it can dyscerne the wordes of god from the wordes of men. And wherfore hath he giuen the chyrch that gyfte, but bycause he wyll not suffre hys chyrch to fall into such a perylous errour, as to take the wordes of men for ye wordes of god / wherby men myght fall to some euyll  opynyons as well in fayth as other vertuys. But so is it that by the errour of wronge takynge the sense of goddes wordes, men may fall into the lyke perell, & also to a great deale greater. For the wrytynge of man taken for the scrypture of god, myghte eyther by some conuenyent coment deuysed vpon the trewth wryten in mennes hartes, or by the playne persuasyon & cōfessyon of our own ignoraūce, that the sentēce were not suffyciently perceyued & vnderstandē, myght I say be conteyned & kepte from doynge any great harme. But the scrypture of god taken as it is for hys own wordes, & then vnderstonden falsely / muste nedys caste the people into a very fals errour in stede of very trewe fayth.
                  Now theruppon it very well foloweth, that god neuer wyll permyt & suffre hys chyrche to fall in any dampnable  errour thorow mysse vnderstādyng & wrong declaracyō of ye scripture / for as mych as by the takyng in necessary poyntes of fayth or vertue the false sentence for the trewe, must nedes growe mych more perell and harme, then by the takyng of mānys false wrytynge for y• trew scripture of god.
                  By thys argument lo the kynges hyghnes vtterly confuted Luther vpon Luthers owne wordes / & proued hym that he may neuer say nay for shame, but that in all necessary poyntes the very trew sense and e

                     posycyon of the scrypture, is in the chyrche & the holy doctours therof. whose exposycyōs as by theyr bokes appereth, openly reproue such exposycyons therof, as all these heretykes haue deuysed for the mayntenaunce of theyr heresyes.
                  
                     
                      Then layed hys hyghnesse vnto Luther hys owne wordes afore sayd yet agayn in thys wyse.
                  Syth god hath as Luther confesseth gyuen the chyrch that gyfte, that it dyscerneth the wordes of god frome the wordes of man / Luther well sheweth hym selfe such as he is, whyle he calleth the pystle of saynt Iamys the worde of man, whyche the chyrch hath so longe dyscerned and iudged for the worde of god.
                  Fynally the selfe same wordes of Luther as the kynges hyghnes handeleth them, fully do conclude Luther & Tyndale both, in prouyng the knowen catholyke chyrche to be the very chyrche / whyche is now as ye knowe well, all our whole mater.
                  
                      For syth saynt Austayne sayth and Luther also confesseth, that the chyrch hath thys gyfte of god, that it dyscerneth the very scrypture of god from the wrytynge of man / and in those wordes, both saynt Austayn and Luther both spake of the knowen catholyke chyrche, and not of an vnknowen chyrch: yt appereth playne that both saynt Austayne and Luther afferme, confesse, & agre, that the knowē catholyke chyrch is the very chyrch / and not that any chyrche of heretykes is the chyrche / for to none of them god neuer gaue that gyfte of dyscresyon. For no man euer toke the scrypture bycause any of them sayd so / but all they as they haue comen out of the catholyke chyrch, so haue of the catholyke chyrche receyued the scrypture / and vppon the credence of that chyrche, haue they all byleued it / as Tyndale  can not denye, though these newe heretykes be nowe for defence of theyr heresyes, fayne to forsake some part of the scrypture to.
                  Now good chrysten readers, consyder well I requyre you these effectuall poyntes, whych our souerayn lorde so substancyally layed vnto Luther vpon hys owne wordes / and I dowte not but your selfe shall easyly perceyue & se, that the same thynges shall stande stronge and sure / & ouer that answere and ouerthrowe all the substaunce of Tyndals solucyon here. whose wordes lette vs now loke on agayne and examyne.

                  For by all this .viii. hundred yeres hath Cryste hadde none other chyrche contynuynge that any man can tell of / but yf Tyndale wyll saye yes / and when he can neither tell whyche nor where, wyll yet say styll yes, and nothyng but yes, and loke that we sholde agaynst our owne experyence vppon his bare worde byleue hym, bycause he sayth styll  yes / wyth as myche profe in his yes, as a gose hath in her hysse.

                  These are the thynges that holy saynte Austayne made that reason for, agaynste suche heretykes as Luther and Tyndale be now. whych other dyd then as these do now, labour to make folke byleue that theyr chyrch of heretyques were the very chyrche, and the catholyque chyrche were a chyrche of heretykes. Agaynst those heretykes say I, and wyth them agaynste these heretyques to, dyd that holy doctour saynte Austayn, not onely eyght hundred yere agoo, whyche were yet a lenger tyme by almoste halfe then euer hadde any secte of heretyques any contynuaunce yet / but  lenger byfore eyght hundred yere then almost half .viii. C. agayne, make this inuyncyble reason whyche nowe thys worshyppefull wyld gose so comely scoffeth and scorneth / by whyche for all his goodly scoffynge at saynt Austaynes reason, he shall neuer whyle he lyueth auoydeyt, but that saynt Austayn hath by that reason alone, all though he neuer had made mo / where as Tindale wel knoweth though he wolde haue yt seme nay, that saynt Austayne made for that purpose many mo / but though he neuer hadde I saye made mo for that purpose then that one: yet had yt one agaynst Martyne Luther and wyllyam Tyndale to, and agaynste all the heretykes that euer haue ben, are nowe, or euer shall be herafter, well and clerely proued that theyr chyrche be all the many false, and onely the knowen catholyque chyrche the very trew chyrche of Cryste.
                  
                      And now syth this reason that Tyndale here setteth so lyght, was as hym selfe after cōfesseth, made by saynt Austayne hym selfe so mayny hundred yere ago, and hath be

                  O good lorde, what great pytye yt was that saynte Austayne hadde not had as myche wyt as wyllyam Tyndale that he myghte haue seen that his argument wolde so sone be soyled / and that yt was no better for the chyrche agaynste

heretyques, then for the Iewes agaynste crystendome  / but euen the selfe same reason that maynteyneth, them in theyr obstynacy & kepeth them from crystendome.
                  But surely saynte Austayn good man saw not so farre. For syth her neuer founde in all his days, neyther Iew nor heretyque so madde to make hym that answere whyche myght so, sone be voyded / he trusted well good man that there wolde neuer none be so folyshe in suche wyse to soyle yt after.
                  How be yt yf saynt Austayne hadde had no more to say to the Iewes for the defence of his reason, then the heretykes hadde to saye to hym in the soylynge of his reason: then myght the heretyques well haue mokked saynt Austayne, as Tyndale doth nowe, and soyled hys reason in the selfe same fashyon / and so wolde they sone haue done ye may be  sure, had they not seen full well that they sholde haue won them selfe nothynge but shame therby. For yf any he retyke wold so haue sayd vnto saynt Austayn, y• the Iewes myght saye the same to the crysten people, you knowe not the scryptures of god but by vs bycause we tell you so, ergo we be the very chyrche of god / and vs ye muste byleue as well in the vnderstandynge of the scrypture, as ye byleue vs in the knowynge whyche is the scrypture: saynte Austayne wolde sone haue sayde agayne, that crysten people myght answere the Iewe and say, we neyther receyue the scrypture of you nor know the scrypture by you, nor yet byleue you neyther in the declaracyon therof. For yf we dyd / then muste we graunt the gospell were no scrypture, nor nothynge that any of Crystes apostles wrote, nor some  bokes neyther whyche were taken oute of your owne hebrew tonge.

                  And therfore may we saye to Tyndale, that he can not say for the mayntenannce of his solucyon, any such thyng agaynste the reason of saynt Austayne, as saynte Austayn myght haue sayd agaynst such other heretykes. For Tyndale can not saye that the chyrch of Cryste is at an ende as the synagoge of the Iewes is / nor can not deny but that he toke the scrypture of the chyrche, and lerned to knowe the

scrypture by the teachyng of the chyrch / & that none other  chyrche, but the knowen catholyke chyrche, vnto whyche god hath geuyn the gyfte to dyscerne and knowe the scripture from all other wrytyng / as Tyndales own mayster Martyne Luther as false as he is, could not yet for shame but confesse.
                  And thus lo good crysten reders, here ye clerely se that Tyndales example and symylitude of the Iewes, wherby he wolde shake of saynt Austayns reason made agaynst he retykes, to proue the catholyque chyrche the very chyrch, is well and clerely voyded and proued farre vnlike / so that Tyndale muste seke hym selfe a new solucyon for this.

often rehersed, & bycause he wyll haue the catholyke chyrch  to be to suche as wyll lerne, the pyller and sure stablyshement of trouth, as well in doctryne of fayth as of maners. And theruppon we very truely conclude, that the whole catholyque chyrche of .xv. hūdred yere, is better to be byleued then Luther or Tyndale eyther in the vnderstandyng of scrypture / and that we therfore rather oughte to byleue the catholyque chyrche, that by the vnderstandynge of scrypture hath tolde vs this .xv. hundred yere, that yt is abomynable for a frere to wedde a nunne, then to byleue wyllyam Tyndale / whyche in defence of Martyne his mayster, or frere Luther hym selfe eyther, whych for the defence of his owne shamefull synne, by the false glosynge of the scripture, affermeth that freres to wedde nūnys were well and vertuously done.

                  And so Tyndale can in thys poynt neuer make the synagoge of Moyses lyke the chyrche of Chryste, that is to wytte the knowen cōtynued catholyke chyrch / to the onely whyche as saynte Austayne sayth and Luther confesseth, and Tyndale can not saye naye, god hath gyuen the grace  to knowe the very scrypture from the false, and the wordes of god frome the wordes of men, and to teche other folke the same all suche as gyue credence to it.
                  Besydes this, yf he wyll make hys ensample lyke / then muste he fyrste name vs a good sorte of those hundred prophetes, that in that meane tyme bytwene Moyses & Cryste called the people home from idolatry.

                  And therfore yf Tyndale wyll now make hys mater good and hys ensample lyke / he muste reherse vs a lyke sorte of some suche other holy prophetes, as god hath syth the deth of Cryste in thys .xv. hundred yere, sent hyther to call home his chyrche from idolatry / as those other prophetes were that he speketh of / sent in shorter season, to call home agayne the Iewes.
                  
                  Thys must he shewe vs yf he shewe any thynge to purpose. And then whome shall he name vs? Nicholaus and Cheryntus, Uigilantius Dormitantius, Manicheus, Ualentinus, Arrius, Iouiniane, Heluidius, Ennomius, Marcion, Montanus, wyclyffe, and Husse / and a sorte of lewde wedded freres, as Luther, and Lambert, and Huyskyn / or prestes apostataas from the chrysten fayth, as Pomeran, Suynglius, and Huchyn here hym selfe. If he name you these / let hym proue them onys good men, or at ye lest wyse some one amonge them all, let hym proue theyr doctryne agreable, or at the leste wyse obstynately not repugnaunt / let hym that sheweth any ferther thynge then hys felowes, by some maner meane proue hym selfe sent by god, or such a man at the leste wyse as the people myghte haue cause to  reken hym for hys lyuynge, a man very lykely for god in so greate a mater to chese oute specially and sende forth on hys errande.

                  And therfore yf these heretykes wyll nowe be resembled to Chryste and hys apostles and to saynt Iohn̄ / let Tyndale tell vs whyche of them to whyche of these? If these be now sent to call the catholyke chyrche to the ryghte faythe from whyche it was fallen before, as Chryst was and hys apostles wyth saynt Iohn̄ hys fore goer to call home the synagoge / than lette Tyndale now tell vs whyche of them he resembleth to saynte Iohan, whyche to Chrystes apostles, and whyche vnto Chryste hym selfe. And yf he lyken Luther to Chryste, thenne who was Luthers saynte Iohn̄ Babtyste and fore goer / or ellys whose fore goer and baptyste  is Luther, to whome maketh he the waye now as the tother dyd to Chryst? I wene in good fayth to Antechryst, and so forth to the deuyll of hell.
                  How be it of treuth, holy prophetes hath there bene sent vnto the worlde by god and into the chyrche of Chryst, mo then an hundred syth the deth of Chryste, to kepe in the ryghte fayth and calle home the people fro synne, by the trewe doctryne of the spyryte, inspyrynge theym the ryghte sense of scrypture, & what so euer god wolde haue knowen besyde. whose doctryne in the necessary poyntes dyd agre togyther, and which were holy men, so knowen well whyle they lyued, and so taken after theyr deth declared for goddes messengers by many a myghty myracle.
                  Of these men may I name full many of sundry tymes,  as saynt Ignacius

                  Now yf Tyndale dare saye that hym self meneth these / then say we that none of these called vs to Tyndals fayth. For none of them dyd constrewe the scrypture as Tyndale doth. And therfore hys fayth is not Chrystes fayth, nor Tyndals doctryne agreable and consentynge to theyrs. For yf Tyndale dare saye that hys doctryne and theyrs agree / lette Tyndale then of theym all name vs now some o

                     Then syth that of hys hundred prophetes bytwene  Moyses and Cryste, Tyndale leueth of foure score and nynetene, and is content to take no mo but saynt Iohn̄, to shewe that hym selfe doth go from the catholyke chyrche & rebuke the doctryne therof, as saynt Iohn̄ dyd fro the synagoge, & rebuked the doctryne of the phareseys: he muste shewe vs as I answered him ī my sexte boke, y• or he proue saynt Iohn̄ and hym selfe matches in that poynt, he muste proue that hym selfe was prophecyed vppon to be the fore goer of some newe Cryste as good as euer was the olde. He muste also shewe vs hys lyuynge somewhat more lyke the lyuynge of saynt Iohn̄ then it appereth yet.
                  Also bycause he sheweth no myracles / he muste proue vs that hys newe Chryste to whome hym selfe is the fore goer, must do suche myracles as our olde Cryste dyd / and  then bere wytnesse of Tyndale hys holy baptyste, as oure Cryste bare wytnesse of the tother. And all thys in hys lyfe besyde myracles many shewed for hym when he is dede.

                     re to god then to gyue to a pore man / and the thynge that he sayth the pharysyes taughte, that yt was more merytoryouse to offre vnto god, then helpe his father with y• money, were he in neuer so great nede. For I am not lyke boūden to helpe  euery straunger yt is a porem, tanhat is say in some pouerty / as to helpe myne owne father that were im extreme necessyte. And yet as vnlyke as they be, these two thynges doth Tyndale here lyken to gether. Myght he not here lyken almoste as well Powles steple to a dagger sheth?
                  And yet in this lykenynge as vnlyke as they be, he letteth not a lytle to lye, to lynke them so nere to gether.
                  For I wysse Tyndale know
                        •
                     th very well, that no man teacheth so precysely as he reherseth / yt yt is better to offre to god and hys holy sayntes dede, then vnto the pore lyuyng saynts. But the doctryne of the chyrch is as hym self can tell full well yf he lysted not to lye, that whych of those two thynges offrynge or geuynge in almoyse is for the tyme more merytoryouse, dependeth vppon the cyrcumstaunces

of the dede, & the persons at the tyme. For yt were  not alwaye trew to saye, that I muste helpe my father byfore a straunger, nor my selfe byfore a nother man. For my father may percase haue some nede and my selfe both / and yet not so myche, but that I were bounden for the tyme to geue fro my selfe, & yet not to my father, but for the tyme to some straunger whome I neuer knewe byfore / his necessyte may be suche.
                  And therfore the catholyque chyrche teacheth, that both to gyue almoyse is good, and to offer is good / and he that hath wherwyth to do both, ought to do the tone, and doth well to do the tother. But where the tone ys better and where the tother / is to be consydred by hym that doth yt, vppon the tyme and persons, and many other cyrcumstaunce mo then well can be comprehēdyd and gyuen men  in wrytyng, vnder any suche certayne rules, but that some tyme they may fayle. But reason ruled by charyte and deuocyon, shall not nede to fere but they shall do bothe full well, and perceyue suffycyētly where the tone is to be done and where the tother, yf they folowe not these heretyques in contempnynge the tone.

                  And yet dyd she yt but to do hym pleasure wyth, as men dyd then vnto gestes to make them chere with all / as folke do now caste damaske water and burne plesaūt perfumes. All be yt vnware to her selfe se dyd in dede worke a mystery therin, that dyd betokē his beryeng. But god as I say the thāke yt he gaue her, he gaue her not for ye mystery wherupō she thought not / but for her deuout mynde y• she bare towarde hym. And yet peraduenture neyther she wold nor god wolde she sholde, haue bestowed yt so in case yt hadde happened that there had lyen a man so lyke, that wtyhout yt oyntement he shold haue / dyed & that she had well wyste

                      or thought, that she might by that oyntement saue his lyfe and by nothypge ellys.
                  But all be yt there were pore men very many whom she myght haue refreshed, & well wyste there were so: yet syth she neyther knewe theyr nede for so great that requyred so sodayne helpe, nor other mennys deuocyon for so small, but that they myghte be holpen by other folke / she neyther thought her self boūden nor no more she was in dede, to folowe the counsayle of Iudas in geuynge the pryce to pore men, rather then in wytnesse and testymonye of her good wyll and deuocyon, te spende yt out in pleasure vppon the blessed body of Cryste. And yet was he not rauyshed wyth the odour of her oyntemēt, but wyth y• delyte of her deuocyon / in whych he delyteth yet when any man doth the lyke.
                  
                      And therfore I say, that though the pharysyes taughte wronge, whome saynte Iohn̄ reproued and our sauyoure hym selle also, in that they taught that yt was better to offre the money to god, then honoure and helpe theyr father and mother therwyth were theyr nede neuer so great: yet the chyrche teacheth ryghte. For yt teacheth playne the cō
                     trarye therof / and sayeth that the pharysees taughte false / and teacheth onely that to offre to god and his sayntes is well done, and that to helpe pore men and gyue almoyse muste nedes be done. And when and in what case the tone is more merytoryouse then the tother, the chyrche teached many good and resonable rules / and yet can no man well tell so many, but that as I sayde some tyme the reason of the man ruled wyth charyte and deuocyō that cōmeth and  worketh wyth grace muste be his guyde therin.
                  But now these new men begyn to geue a certayn rule, that as they say shall put vs quyte out of all doute, when we shall do the tone and whē the tother. For therin lo thus they say. Offrynge say they, to god or to sayntes, and lyke wyse byeldynge of chyrches, byenge of copes, bokes, surplyce, and chalyce, be thynges voluntarye, to the doynge wherof no commaundement of god constrayneth the. But as for geuynge of almoyse is a thynge necessary, wherunto god by his own biddyng byndeth the. And therfore fyrst euermore geue thy money to the pore men that nede yt as longe as there be any, And then lo whē there be no mo pore men left y• ye may bestowe youre money vppon / go to then good crystyens in goddes name and bestow the remanaūt

wheron ye wyll, euen vppon pylgremages yf ye lyst, lo and  vppon offrynges, and byeldynge of chyrches, and byeng of bokes, and copes, and crosses, and shyppes, and sensers hardely to for me. And therfore saye not now yt we say that the volūtary thynges be not lawfull. For we say no more, but ye the necessary thynges must nedes be done fyrste / and I wysse good crystyens ye wote well your sel
                        •
                     e that is very good reason.
                  Now to thende that ye may good reders the better perceyue whyle they teache in thys maner, what theyre very mynde is in the mater / ye shall vnderstande that it happed my selfe to be vppon a tyme present in a certayne assemble of personages, bothe of great honoure and also of great connynge / in whyche amonge other thynges that were there treated of, one that hadde in sundry places preached  after suche maner fashyon as I haue here rehersed you, was demaunded and asked whyther yt were ynough byfore a man bestow his money vppon such kyndes of volūtary, to helpe fyrste such pore nedy folke as he happened to here of vnsought or ellys that he must besydes that byfore he bestowe any money other wyse, seke and serche about whether he may fynd any mo. wherunto he answered well and playnely, that we be fyrst bounden to seke & serch & be sure therof / namely bycause of suche as can not come forth but lye styll bedred at home / & some that be peraduenture a shamed to offre theym selfe and begge,
                  Then was he demaūded farther, syth yt was not inough to geue pore men whē they asked, nor where we foūd them by happe / but we were forther boūden before we bystowed  ought vppon volūtarye, to seke and serche out such necessary: whyther yt suffysed then to take for our parte those nedy folke that were founde in oure owne paryshe, or ellys that we muste extende oure almoyse farther to the whole towne. wherunto he answered, that neyther suffysed oure paryshe nor our towne, no nor all our own whole countrey neyther / but where so euer there where any pore nedy men, we were bounden to helpe theym all, byfore we sholde any thynge bestowe vppon suche kyndes of voluntary / so that fynally the man was fully mynded, rather to send vs all to Rome to seke & serch out some pore man and bere him a peny thether, then to suffer vs spende a halpeny eyther oute or at home, vppon any offerynge eyther to god / or saynte

                      or byeldynge of chyrche or garnysshynge therof, or byenge of any ornament therfore.
                  And surely yf these folke saye well / then Mary mawdelayne dyd not wel, but was mych to blame.
                        Matth. 26
                      For I am very sure, and our sauyour hym selfe shall bere me recorde, that yf she wolde haue soughte and serched, she moughte haue founden in Hierusalem euyn at her hande, pore nedy men inough to haue receyued twyse as mych money as all that oyntement was worth.
                  Cryste blamed not those that offered into the treasory of the temple,

                      nor sayd that they offered to myche / but rather by praysyng of the pore wydow that offered somwhat of her pouerty, rebuked the rych folke for offeryng to 
                        •
                     ytle / all be it that as the gospell sayth, many offered mych. And  yet as I sayed of thys am I very sure, that they myghte haue had poremen inough to bestowe that money vppon in relyefe necessary, that they there spent vppon the temple, a thynge as these men call it, voluntary.
                  How be it I meruayle why they sholde call it all voluntary, for some of it be thynges that must nedes be done. For chyrches at the leste wyse muste we nedes haue / and yet therto saye some of these folke naye.
                  But holy saynt Chrysostome calleth vpō folke to byeld chyrches there as it semed necessary / and that so farforth, that rather then to leue that wurke vndone, he wolde they sholde gyue the lesse to pore folke to do the tother wythall. And thenne dare I saye that he wolde haue men bye bothe bokes and chalyces and other ornamentes therto.
                  
                      And thus may we sone se, that these new sectes of Tyndals sorte be farre fro saynt Chrysostomes mynde. For ye may well perceyue by theyr doctryne, that when they wold haue all pore men sowght out euer and serued, and euery mannes necessyte done, before any of the tother thynges that they call voluntary shold be by any man begon / what other prechyng is thys, but vtterly to forbyd thē, not with playne wordes, but wyth wurse then playne wordes, wyth blasphemouse mockerye, knauysshe derysyon and scorne.
                  And surely that worde of Tyndale in whyche he calleth the sayntes that are departed dede sayntes / all be it that there were none harme therin spoken by a good mannes mouth, yet hath it a shrewde sygnyfycacyon spoken out of hys / syth Luther and he wene that there were not one of

theym all in heuyn, but that they lye all in a slepe styll no  man woteth where / and therfore Tyndale bydded vs pray to theym when we speke wyth theym / so that tyll than, he wolde we sholde let them alone.
                  And thus good chrysten reders, for conclusyon of thys poynt, ye maye clerely se that concernynge offerynges to god or hys sayntes, or money bestowed aboute those good wurkes that these folke call all voluntary, the chyrche techeth ryghte / as appereth well by playne and euydent scrypture. And that the doctryne of the pharyseys whyche Cryste reproued, the chyrche reproueth also and therof techeth the contrary. And so the doctryne of the chyrche and the doctryne of the pharyseys in thys poynte, wherin Tindale resembleth them togyther and lyeth to, to make them lyke / be no more lyke togyther, then is chalke to colys.
                  
                  Nowe is all the remanante of hys processe as ye haue herde, nothynge ellys but raylynge vppon the doctours of the catholyke chyrche, for byleuynge that the sacramentes be not bare sygnes and tokens, and bycause of the bylyefe of purgatory.
                  Now am I very gladde that ye se so clerely, that those whome thys newe saynte Iohn̄ Baptyste calleth pharyseys, be all those olde holy doctours and sayntes that haue bene in euery age thys fyftene hundred yere. For all they haue byleued in the same sacramentes that we do, and the same thynges that thys newe baptyste rebuketh.
                  And in lykewyse of purgatory Tyndale can not saye naye. For I haue in my thyrde booke of hys confutacyon, layed hym playne wordes of dyuers of the eldest and most holy doctours / and amonge other saynte Chrysostome, wrytynge that the apostles them selfe prayed for soules in theyr masses.
                  And now se you playnely that Tyndale calleth theym all pharyseys therfore / and is come as a newe saynt Iohn̄ Baptyste, to shewe vs that by name thys .viii. hundred yere, but by his declaracion thys .xv. hundred yere, the pharyseys, that is to wytte all the holy doctours and sayntes that haue bene all thys whyle in chrystendome from Cryst hym selfe hytherto / the treuth of whose fayth, and the holynes of whose lyuynge, our lorde hath illustrate and set

The sacrament of extreme vncciō he calleth but gresynge the syke man.

                  Nowe good crysten reders here haue you herde one of his answers, whych how yt maketh any thynge to the purpose, surely that se not I. For where as the reason of saint  Austayne is, that men may perceyue that this knowen catholyque chyrche is the very chyrch, in that that god hath vnto this chyrche geuen his gyfte of dyscernynge the very scrypture of god from the counterfete, and to receyue the tone and reiecte the tother / and that he hath so geuen that grace vnto this chyrch onely, that no man can ordynaryly be sure whyche wrytynge is holy scrypture and whyche is not, but by the tradycyon of this chyrche and credence geuen therunto / for yf he toke yt of a company of heretiques, yet euermore those heretykes lyke as they came out of this whole chyrche, and theyr authours and begyn
                        •
                     ers were onys a parte therof, and then of this chyrche receyued the scrypture byfore they departed oute therof / so dothe euermore the credēce wheruppon the knowlege of the trew scrypture  dependeth, that credēce I say resorteth euer vppe to this whole catholyke chyrche / vnto whyche wythoute credence had ben geuen, none heretyke had knowen whyche were the very scrypture. For the profe wherof, we yet se y• these h
                        •
                     retykes in so ferforth as they byleue the chyrch, in so ferforth they knowe whyche is the scrypture / and in so ferforth as they byleue not the chyrche, they perceyue not whyche is the scrypture, though they haue it in theyr handes and rede yt. As ye may se by the pistle of saynt Iames / whyche pystle Luther and frere Ba
                        •
                     ons let not to reiecte and set a syde for nought. And thus euermore heretikes all the scrypture that they know, by the catholyke chyrch they know. For to this onely chyrche as Tyndales owne mayster

confesseth, hath god gyuen that gyfte to dyscerne the trew scrypture fro the false. And syth that god hath geuen this great spyrytuall gyfte onely to the chyrche, whyche gyfte is a begynnynge of spyrytuall lyuely doctryne / yt therby well and clerely appereth to any man that wyll not wylfully wynke, that this chyrche is the very chyrche, of whyche god wyll haue men lerne.
                  Now good cristen reder, this beyng the reason and purpose of holy saynte Austayne / and hauyng in yt selfe suche strength, that Luther coulde not hym selfe say nay therto / not withstandynge that the confessynge therof must nedes ouerturne his here
                        •
                     yes: now byddeth Tyndale his dyscyples, that they shall answere therto, that the catholyque chyrch is not to be thāked for the scripture that we receyue  therof, but the botomlesse mercy of god / & here is all thys whole answere to the reason / for all the remanaunt is nothynge ellys but raylynge agaynste the chyrch.
                  Now what goth this answere to the purpose? who byddeth hym geue the thanke to the chyrche? let hym lyke as he byleueth the chyrch that the gospels of the foure euangelystes be the trew gospell of Cryste, so know therby and byleue that the same chyrche, by whyche he knoweth that poynt, and whyche in that poynte he byleueth, is here in erth the very chyrche of Cryste / and then let hym geue the thanke to god, wythout whose grace workyng wyth hym, he coulde not byleue the chyrche neyther in the tone poynt nor the tother / and for lakke of whose grace, whych grace he lakketh not but in his own defaut, he now byleueth not  the tone poynte as he dothe the tother, excepte he lakke so mych that for his malyce he byleue neyther nother. I pray god geue hym onys the grace to byleue both / and when he so doth, then shall he haue the grace therwyth to perceyue, that he hath for the knowlege of the trewe scrypture frome the false, great cause to geue thanke to both. Fyrste & pryncypally to god that gaue that gyfte vnto his chyrche, and wrought wyth hym to byleue yt / and after to the chyrche, that was a meane and mynyster in bryngynge that grace vnto hym / and cause also to be gladde a great dele in hym selfe, that he resysted not god and his chyrche, but folowed and went wyth them in callynge hym home agayne, to the bylyefe of god and his chyrche, from the damnable wayes of his malycyouse errours.
                  
                     And now that ye playnly perceyue that this answere of  his nothynge toucheth the purpose / I wolde very fayne passe ouer his folyshe raylynge, sauyng that yt semeth necessary that the foly and lyes of suche false frantyque heretykes may be well knowen, lest some good symple soules may wene them wyse and trew therwyth, and theruppon be deceyued and byleue them.
                  Fyrste he rayleth vppon the doctours of the catholyke chyrch, & sayth yt they haue destroyed y• right sence of y• scripture with theyr leuyn. Now all this ye wote well he meaneth, in y• they teach that folke shuld not trust in only fayth wythout good workes of cheryte and of penaūce, and that they teache that freres sholde not wedde n

                  who hath corrupted these legendes? let hym name some one and proue it, or els let hym leue of hys lyenge.
                  The legendes of sayntes lyues were wryten in dyuers tymes, as the sayntes in dyuerse tymed lyued, and in dyu
                        •
                     rs dyed / of whose lyues the chyrch none other knoweth, but as they fynde wryten or herde by good folke that knew them / sauyng that the spyryte of god by whych it knoweth and dyscerneth as saynt Austayn sayth & Luther hym selfe alloweth, whych is the very scrypture, shall not suffre it as that holy doctour saynt Thomas sayth, to erre and be deceyued, in takynge for a saynt any dampned person, & therby geue to goddes enemye the honour dew to hys frende. And by thys spyryt what so euer be wryten in the legende of any saynte, the chyrche dyscerneth yf any thyng were at any tyme in the good man a mysse / & so taketh it as a faute for the tyme and afterwarde amended / as we rede of some of Crystes owne apostles reported in the very gospell.
                  And the chyrche also doth not precysely bynde any man to the bylyef of euery thyng wryten in a legend, as though euery sayntes legende were parte of the scrypture of god.
                  But the thynge that Tyndale is offended wyth is this, that the legendes of sayntes testyfye theyr holy lyuynge & myracles that god shewed for them / wherof we fynde no legende lyke that euer was wryten for any saynt, that in obstynate heresyes departed & dyed out of ye catholike chyrch.
                  Now confesseth Tyndale that all the sayntes legendes be not so corrupted, but he saith almost all. In which word  he sayth inough for vs agaynst hym selfe. For let hym leue neuer so few, & tell vs which they be / and I dowte not then in good fayth, but that we shall in that fewe fynde thynges inough to proue hys heresyes false.
                  yet goth he ferther agaynste the chyrche and sayth, They haue fayned false bookes and put them forth, some in the name of saynt Hier

                           •
                        nd partely by autentyke storyes.
                  
                  Here wolde he fayne good chrysten reders bryng vs all in dowte of all the olde holy doctours wurkes / bycause he were lothe by hys wyll, that any were of them all byleued.
                  
                     
                      But what great harme and losse were there in the mater, though it somtyme happed the boke of one good holy man to be named the boke of an other / as a boke of saynte Austayn to be taken for a boke of saynt Ambrose? There were in such a mater no very great hurte yf it so happed in dede.
                  But to the entent that ye shall playnely perceyue that thys tale of Tyndale wherwyth he wold fayne blynde vs, shall nothynge serue for hys purpose / let hym take the bokes of whyche hym selfe nothynge douteth, and euyn by yt selfe same shall he fynde hys opynyons proued playne heresyes. Or ellys let Tyndale fynd vs in some of theyr trew bokes, whych he douteth not to be theyr owne in dede, let hym proue I saye by theym, that all those bokes be falsely put out in theyr names / in whych bokes he fyndeth yf they  be trewe, all holy saintes agre agaynst hym selfe that good wurkes are merytoryouse, & that folkes do well to honour sayntes & theyr relyques, and go in pylgrymages, and to praye for all chrysten soules, & to honour the blessed sacramēt, and that it is abominable for freres to wedde nonnes, & such other thynges lyke. Let Tindale I say fynde vs the contrary of these 
                        •
                     alys taught vs in theyr trewe bokes / or els let hym tell vs no more of hys own tale, but leue of his lyes lyke a fole,
                  And fyrst for the meane whyle, the boke in whych saynt Austayn maketh thys reason that we now talke of for the catholyke chyrch / Tyndale doth hym selfe cōfesse to be the very boke of saynt Austayne. And then doth this r
                        •
                     ason alone playnely & perfytely proue this knowē catholyke chyrche,  to be the very chyrche of Cryste / & consequently therby proueth Tindale that techeth the contrary, to be in the grettest poynte that any man lyghtely can fall in, & on whiche poynt most heresies do depēde, a very playne opē heretyke.
                  Now where he rayleth on and sayth, that Lyke wyse as the Iewys had set vp a boke of theyr Talmud to destroye the sense of the scrypture, so the chyrche hath set vp he sayth theyr Dunce, theyr Thomas, and a thousand lyke draffe, to stablysse theyr lyes thorow falsefyeng the scripture: I can no scyll of the Iewes Talmud / but one thing I dowte not of, but y• theyr Talmud in yt it gaue false expesycyō was a late thyng at the comyng of Cryst, yf they had thē any such boke. And I dowte not but that the thinges that were fals therin, varyed from the consent of theyr olde exposytours, by whych the falshed of it myght be spyed & controlled and

be byleued the lesse.
                  
                  But our doctours of these eyghte hundred yeres laste passed / all whome thys worthy wylde gose calleth draffe, do consente and agre wyth the olde holy doctours of the tother .vii hundred yere afore. And as well all those olde whom he dare not call but holy, as these other thousande whom he calleth draffe, drawe by one lyne all the mayny, to dreue Tyndale as a drudge of the deuyll out of Crystes chyrche for an heretyke / or ellys as I haue almost a thousande tymes desyred hym, let Tyndale tell vs of all those old, which one taught it for lawfull a frere to wed a nōne.
                  Now where the wretche rayleth by name vppon that holy doctoure saynt Thomas, a man of that lernyng that the greate excellent wyttes and the moste connynge men  that the chyrche of Cryste hath hadde synnes hys dayes, haue estemed and called hym the very floure of theology, and a man of that trewe perfyte fayth and crysten lyuynge therto, that god hath hym selfe testyfyed hys holynesse by many a greate myracle, and made hym honowred here in hys chyrche in erth, as he hath exalted hym to greate glory in heuyn: this gloryouse saynt of god wyth all other lyke, and those be of trouth all the whole many bothe olde and newe togyther, all whome therfore by the whole thousand on an hepe (for no fewer he nombreth them) doth thys deuelysshe dronken soule abomynably blaspheme, and calleth them lyars and falsefyers, of scrypture and maketh them no better then draffe. But thys drowsy drudge hath dronken so depe in the deuyls dregges, that but if he wake  and repente hym selfe the soner / he maye happe ere awghte longe, to fall into the messhynge fatte, and turne hym selfe in to draffe, as the hogges of hell shall fede vppon and fyll theyr belyes therof.
                  But when the beste hath thus blasphemed theym all / then wold he wynde out with a wyle, and make men wene that he ment but the doctours of these last eyghte hundred yeres / which were yet inough to laye such a raylyng knaue eyghte hundred myle depe in hell.
                  But syth he sayth a thousand lyke vnto saynt Thomas / he can not so escape, as though he met but saynt Bernard, saynt Bonauenture, saynt Ancelme, and suche other holy men of these eyght hundred yeres passed laste / but he must nedes take into them, all the olde holy sayntes of the seuen

                      hundred yeres byfore, as many as in suche thynges as Tyndale fyndeth fawte wyth expownyng the scrypture agaynst the mynd of Tyndale, lyke wise as saint Thomas doth. But nowe to coloure his blasphemy / those wolde he sholde seme were none. And therfore 
                        •
                     o thus he sayth.
               
               
                  Tyndale.
                  
                     And yf a man alledge any holy doctour agaynst them, they glose hym out as the do the scrypture, or wyll not here, or say the chyrche hath other wyse determyned.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Lo good cristen reder this false pageaunt playeth Tyndale in mo places then one / makynge as though that in the maters of his heresies the new doctours onely were agaynste hym. And yet calleth he the new, the doctours of  eyght hundred yere olde / and suche a new cote I wold he gate hym, and were oute his olde the whyle.
                  And then maketh he as though the old of the tother seuen hūdred yere byfore, were vpon his parte all the whole mayny, and cōstrued the scripture as he doth, and condēne these exposycyons that the new doctours of eyght hūdred yere olde and vnder haue made synnys.
                  And he sayth that agaynste all holy doctoures when he layeth any one agaynst vs, we glose hym out, or wyll not here hym, or say the chyrch hathe otherwyse determyned. Here must Tyndale vnderstand, that we neuer bynde hym to any thynge of necessyte vppon the saynge of any one doctoure be he olde or yonge / but eyther by the comen faste fayth of the whole catholyke chyrch, growē as yt euer doth  by the spyryte of god, that maketh men of one mynde in his chyrche, or by the determynacyon of the chyrche assembled for such causes in the generall counsayles.
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      And then the comen fayth of olde tymes byfore our dayes, we presume to be suche of lykelyhed / as we perceyue by the olde holy sayntes bokes that they were of them selfe. For other wyse then by bokes can we not knowe what the people byleued a thousand yere ago / but yf we myght talke with the men them selfe and aske theym.
                  Now yf Tyndale coulde laye vs for his purpose peraduenture, a worde of some one holy man / yt were no reason to bydde vs byleue that one byfore the cōsent of many, nor agaynste the comen bylyefe of the catholyque chyrche secretely growen to consent by the holy spyryte of god, nor

agaynst the consent of the catholyque chyrche dyffynynge  that poynt in a generall coūsayle thorow the same spyrite.
                  Now when we thus do / Tyndale can not say that we refuse to here that one holy man whome he shall peaduenture alledge vs for his purpose. For in thus doyenge, we do here hym and folow hym. For euery one of all the olde holy men dyd euer submytte his owne mynde to the determynacyon of the catholyque chyrche, and bode euery man do the lyke.
                  And of them all we wote wel Tyndale fyndeth not one, that sayth contrary to thys. How be it thus myche haue I shewed you, rather to tell vs somwhat of the authoryte of the catholyke chyrche aboue any one holy man, then for any holy man that euer I thynke Tyndale shalbe able to brynge forth for the confyrmacyon of his heresyes.
                  
                  But now to put this mater out of all dowte and qustey on, & that euery man may se whether Tyndale speke here in ernest as he thynketh, or ellys sayth all thys but for a shyft / let him now stande well to his tacklynge, and stykke styffely therto. Let vs concernynge the ryght construccyon of scrypture or corruptynge the trew sense therof, cōsydre some one heresye of his, for whyche the chyrch calleth hym heretyque, let vs se now.
                  we saye that yt ys abomynable for a monke or a frere to wedde a nūne / Tyndale sayth we saye wronge, and that a frere to wedde a nunne is very well done and lawfully. when we forbede yt, we lay the scrypture for vs. Uowe ye and pay yt. And saynt Poule spekynge of the wydows, whych after theyr chastyte vowed vnto god wold fall then  agayne to maryage, sayeth that they hadde theyr damnacyō bycause they therin brake theyr formare faith. Tindale sayth we construe the scrypture wrong / and layeth scrypture for his part the wordes of saint Poule. Better yt is to wedde then to burne. we say he construeth wronge. If we wolde alledge for vs thexposycyon of saynte Thomas, or saynt Anselme, or saynt Bonauenture, or saynt Bernard, or a thousan

                     r, that were alyue at any tyme this eyghte hundred yere / Tyndale wolde call yt our Talmude, and say they were all but draffe.
                  But then he sayth agayn that when he wyll alledge any holy doctour for his parte agaynste vs, we wyll glose hym out, or ellis we wyll not here hym, or ellys we wyll say that

                      the chyrch hath other wyse determyned.
                  Lo good reders here are we comen to gether Tyndale and we to the very point, where you shall se now how courteysly I shall handle hym.
                  Let hym laye forth for his parte some one holy doctour, and I wyll here hym, and I neyther wyll glose hym oute nor saye the chyrche hath determyned otherwyse. For I wene the thynge was neuer taken for so doutefull, that euer the chyrche sholde haue neded. But though yt haue determyned yt / yet wyll I wynke there at and dyssy

                  And therfore I wyll alledge no suche thynge. But let Tyndale laye forth any one holy

                  To thys goodly passe hath Tyndale brought this processe, and shewed vs here two solucyons, both one & both suche as ye se.

                  Lo good crysten reades, here maye ye clerely se what a strength this reason of holy saynt Austayne hath, agaynst whyche these heretikes are fayne to fynde so many shyftes

                      and euer the latter y• lewder. For in thys answere Tyndale is yet ferther fallen in foly, thenne in any of those two that he made before, as fonde as they were bothe.
                  Theffecte of all thys answere is, that hym self and such other hys felowes as take opynyons agaynst the knowen catholyke chyrch, nede not to recognyse and knowlege the knowen catholyke chyrche for the very chyrche / and that the reason that saynt Austayne made therfore is not suffycyent / that is to say, that sauynge for this catholyke chyrch they shold not haue knowen any trewth at all, not so mych as whyche were the trewe gospell and whyche not / & therfore sholde not haue byleued the gospell saue for thys catholyke chyrche.
                  Thys reason sayth Tyndale is nothyng worth. For we  that are electe sayth he and therfore are the very chyrch, do not knowe by the catholyke chyrche whych is the very gospell and the trew scrypture / no more then dyd saynt Iohn̄ Baptyste and the other holy prophetes afore hym, knowe whyche was the trewe scrypture of god by the scrybes and pharyseys and the hygh prestes / whom they dyd not knowledge for the trewe chyrche, nor for those that had the spyryte of god and coulde not erre. But hys felowes and he syth they be goddes electes and therfore the very chyrche, do knowe he sayth whyche is the gospell and whych is the very scrypture, by the same meanes by whyche saynt Iohn̄ Baptyste and the other holy prophetes before hym knewe the very scrypture of god / that is to wytte by the secrete inwarde techynge of the spyryte of god / euyn in lyke wyse as  the egle wythout the techynge of any other spyeth perceyueth & knoweth whyche beste or byrd is mete for hys meate and conuenyent for hys pray, by the secrete inwarde mocyon and instincte of nature. And therfore by thys answere is that reason of saynt Austayne auoyded.
                  Here is lo good chrysten reader all thys answere & thys goodly solucyon, nothyng lefte out that hath any strength or force towarde the purpose

                      but layed yet more dyrectely for hys purpose then Tyndale layeth it hym selfe / saue for leuynge out of the raylynge, wherof we maye peraduenture somwhat touche by the way.
                  But fyrste consyder what blont sotletees & what folysh fallacys he bryngeth in thys answere. He wol

chyrche of Cryste, that is to wytte the whole multytude of  all trewe chrysten people of whyche our mater is, vnto the scrybes and the pharyseys, & the hygh prestes / as though they alone had ben the whole chyrche of the Iewes / or the hygh prestes of one town, the whole vniuersall synagoge.
                  Thys sotletye of Tyndale is as blont as a blocke, and to great for any mā to stūble at y• hath any eyen in his hed.
                  Nor I nede not for this mater to defende that the whole synagoge could not erre in the choyce of the scrypture, nor that the whole synagoge was vntyll Crystes comynge the very chyrche of god neyther, nor to admytte as Tyndale here maketh it euery thynge to go lyke betwene the whole synagoge of Moyses and the catholyke chyrche of Cryste / bytwene whyche twayne, all be it that the tother was for that whyle the very chyrch in dede, there is yet in maner as  great dyfference, as is bytwene the fygure and the thynge, the shadow and the body / as by many maner thinges farre dyfferent I myght well shew you / & among other no small dyfference bytwene them, in the thynge that most properly perteyneth vnto the poynt wherupon specyally dependeth the mater that we haue in hande, that is to wytte the kepyng & preseruyng of the tone or the tother from all dampnable errour. In thys poynt I saye there is specyall dyssymylytude bytwene the synagoge and the chyrche / for the promyses that Cryste hath made vnto the chyrche to sende hys holy spyryte in to it to lede it in to all trouth,

For it is inough to me that the chyrch of Crist hath that gyfte of god by his great promyses, that it shall euer be by him & his spyrit led into euery necessary treuth / of whyche one of the most necessary is, to knowe whych is the trewe scrypture. And it is inough agaynste Tyndale, that hys owne mayster Luther sayth that thys catholyke

knowen chyrche hath that gyfte. And it is a clere thyng to  me and all chrysten men, that none other chyrche hath that gyfte but the catholyke chyrche / syth euery man seeth that the thynge is trewe whyche saynt Austayne sayth, that he had not knowen whyche had ben the very gospell, & therfore had not byleued the gospell, saue for the catholyque chyrche.
                  And as that holy saynt sayth of hym selfe / so may euery man well saye of hym selfe, that by the catholyke chyrche he knoweth the scrypture / whyche no man can reken hym selfe surely to knowe by any other folke, then those whom he rekeneth surely to be the very true chyrche and the messenger of god to tell it hym. For ellys maye euery fole se, that as he dowteth of the messenger, he must n

                  And therfore now lette vs loke on this answere of Tyndale. I lerned not sayth he of the catholyke chyr

                  Here ye se good readers for aughte that euer I can do, Tyndale wylbe saynt Iohn̄ Baptystes felowe, and all his companyons felowes wyth the olde prophetes and wyth Chrystes apostles, and in some places wyth Chryste hym  selfe also.
                  But thys wyll I promyse you, that yf saynt Iohn̄ Baptyste and the olde prophetes, eche of the other prophetes in theyr tyme, had had wyth the Iewys the same thynges in questyon that we haue wyth Luther and Tyndale & these other heretykes in our tyme / that is to saye yf the Iewes had sayd that they had bysyde the scrypture some other tradycyon delyuered them by Moyses, & preserued fro mouth to mouth wythout wrytynge / or that they had varyed togyther vppon the ryght vnderstandyng of the scrypture, & then the Iewes wolde haue sayd ye know not whych is the scrypture but in that ye byleue vs / & then yf ye byleue vs in y•, we tell you Moyses wrote vs this, why sholde you not as well byleue vs whē we tell you Mo

If these had bene the varyaunces bytwene the Iewes and saynt Iohn̄ baptyste, or bytwen the Iewes and the prophetes, as it is bytwene these heretykes and vs / and that the Iewes had then layed thus vnto them: yf that then saynt Iohn̄ and the prophetes coulde haue made no better answere to them for theyr selfe, then Tyndale doth to vs now for hym selfe / surely than lyke as thys answere is such that we maye well laugh at hym, so had it be such as the Iewes  wolde haue laughed at them.
                  But neyther were these poyntes the questyons then bytwene theym (though some of thys was afterwarde in debate bytwene Cryste and the pharyseys) and therfore these ensamples of saynt Iohn̄ and the prophetes be layed here to no purpose.

                  These thynges had they for theyr answere, wyth which the Iewes well myghte and of reason muste, haue holden them selfe fully content and satysfyed.
                  And now in lyke wyse, for as mych as I knowe well ye god is at hys owne lybertye, hauynge hys power absolute free & vnboūden vnto any maner of hys ordynary course / and therfore maye yf it please hym by some secrete inspyracyon,

For after that profe onys made / let hym tell my what he wyll and I wyll byleue hym tyll Antechryste come. For vntyll that tyme I truste heretyques shall do no miracles.
                  But as for yet in the meane season, syth I se none other man say so of hym selfe, as Tyndale saith of hym self & his felowes, and holy saynte Austayne sayth the contrarye of  hym self: tyll Tyndale proue yt trew that he sayth of hym selfe, that he knoweth the trew scripture not by the chyrch but by specyall inspyracyon of god inspyred into hym selfe, and some suche other specyall chosen electes, such as no where in this worlde I wene god coulde haue chosen worse / Tyndale muste of reason geue vs leue to laugh at his prowde inuented folye.

                  Consider than how farre he goth ferther now then euer he went before.

And so is Tyndale shortely quyte ouerthrowen therin to.
                  Also though Tyndale sayd here trew of saynt Austayns mynde, that he byleued the chyrche bycause they were then good men: yet standeth that order styll, that he fyrste byleued the catholyke knowen chyrche, and fyrste knewe and

                  But now wolde I that Tyndale here rehersed vs what was the lyuynge, and whyche were the vertuouse that so flowred in the chyrch, that was in saynte Austayns tyme. Fyrst as for persecucyon that Tyndale speketh of / ye catholyque chyrch had not in his tyme any greater persecucyon by heretykes in Affryke, then yt hadde now these late yeres in Almayne / and I wene as many good chrystē men haue constantely su

                     ystes.
                  Then as for the other vertues and maners that then  were in the chyrche, for whyche saynte Austayne dyd as Tyndale sayth byleue yt / and wolde not yf he nowe lyued and were vncōuerted, so receyue and byleue the scrypture by the chyrche: now wolde god that Tyndale had rehersed those maners and those vertues, that we myght therby perceyue whether saynte Austayne yf he were nowe alyue, and suche as he was byfore hys conuersyon & wolde not be conuertyd by the catholyke chyrche, were lykely to to be conuerted by the conuersacyon of theyrs, by the holy lyuynge of Luther, and Lambert, and Huskyn, and suche a rable of wedded munkes and freres.
                  And yet yf he so were / then muste yt be ye wote well a knowen chyrch. For of an vnknowen chyrche could he not be moued, nor take none authoryte / and so were Tyndals

chyrche of his vnknowen electes clere gone agayn, for any  fortherauns of saynte Austaynes fayth.
                  And therfore muste we then wyt of hym farther, whyche of all his chyrches, which of his false sci
                        •
                     matyke sectes, were yt that sholde do thys dede and wynne vs in s

                     ynte Austayn, that shuld be suche a trew doctour of trew y• chyrch.
                  There is good reders a boke whyche saynte Austayne wryteth agaynste heretyques of his owne tyme, that dyspraysed then the lyuyng of the crysten people of the catholyke chyrch, extollyng the holy vertuouse lyuyng of theyr owne secte / by whyche we may well se ye heretykes had yet at that day a right fayre visage of very vertuouse lyuyng, and preached not theyr heresies with defence of open shamfull lechery, as these bestely heretykes do nowe. But saynt Austayne, all be yt he coulde not say naye, but that in the  chyrche there were as well badde as good: yet descrybeth he partely the vycyouse lyuynge and partely the ypocrysy to, that was then amonge those hcretyques, and bysydes that the vertuouse lyuynge that then was amonge many good folke of the catholyke chyrche.
                  And what vertues be those? surely euen the same that the knowen catholike chyrch teacheth now, and which vertues in this catholyke chyrch many a good man both spyrytuall and temporall yet vnto this daye god be thanked very well kepe and obserue / howe be yt the fewer a great many, syth these deuelyshe heresyes came vppe.
                  And this dare I well promyse Tyndale, let hym rede ouer that boke when he wyll, in whyche saynt Austayn reherseth the vertues y• he prayseth in the chyrche / & when he  hath well and perfytely redde yt onys ouer, or yf he lyste hardely twyse or thryes yt can be no losse of his tyme / and this I say wyll I gladly geue hym wyth yt, let hym take myn yie for an apple, yf he fynde yt in all the boke cōmended for any great vertue, a frere to wedde a nunne.
                  And therfore syth Tyndale alloweth saynte Austayne and the vertues that then were in the chyrch / I wyll bynd hym to none other, but that that he now prayseth and commendeth hym selfe. Lette hym no more but byleue saynte Austayne / and then shall he byleue the sacramentes / and go to shryfte, whych he now calleth the deuyls inuencyon / and shall take absolucyon, whyche he now calleth whystelynge / and shall gladly do penaunce, that he nowe calleth

                      synne / and shall byleue the knowen catholyke chyrche and knowlege yt for the chyrche of cryste, and shall take theym all for heretykes that departe oute therof, and shall byleue surely y• determynacyon therof, and take them all for heretykes that wyll holde the contrary / and then wyll he shaue his crowne agayne, and saye matens and masse after the olde fashyon, and putte of his knaues cote and ware an honeste man / and then he wyll aduyse frere Luther to lye no more wyth nunnes.
                  Hytherto good chrysten reder haue I so reasoned thys poynte of saynt Austaynes wordes, as though Tyndales answere vnto them were trew. And then yf they so were in dede / yet what good effecte hath Tyndale therupon ye perceyue. For though it so were in dede, yet were Tyndale neuer  the nere / but alway wolde yt folowe as I haue shewed you, that the very chyrche must nedes be a knowen chirch, and neyther any chyrche of v

                     knowen heretykes, nor any knowen chyrche of all these heretykes neyther / nor fynally none other but onely thys comen knowen catholyque chyrche.
                  But nowe good reder, for as myche as Tyndale sayth that the chyrche doth falsely take saynt Austayne and contrary to hys mynde, euen in lyke maner as he sayeth they do all the scrypture, to blynde and bygyle the people with: we be very gladde he sayth so. And as Tyndale hath here hym selfe put these wordes of saynte Austayne for ensample, how the chyrche vseth yt sel

                  Now saye we then that where Tyndale sayeth that the cause why saynt Austayne dyd byleue the ch

Thenne syth I obeyd them in that they bode me byleue the gospell / why shold I not byleue them in that they bydde me byleue not. Manicheꝰ. wyll ye now that I byleue the catholike chirch or not?

And now haue ye hard saynte Austayne / whome yf Tyndale wyll byleue, all our questyon is decyded. For he sayth as we saye, that the comen catholyque chyrch is the very chyrch. And yf he wyll not byleue hym / then let hym leue lyke as he is to lay hys owne faute to other folke.
                  Good crysten reders yf my purpose were here to proue you by the consente of the olde holy doctours of Chrystes chyrche, that the knowen catholyque chyrche is the very chyrche: the nomber of those authorytees wolde fyll an hole boke. But my purpose is here onely to answere Tyndale and confute his solucyon, wyth whych he falsely gloseth  the wordes of saynte Austayne, that sayth he byleued not the scrypture yt self but for the authorite of the chyrch. wherin I haue playnely proued you by saynt Austaynes owne wordes, Tyndales wordes shamfully false, as well in the pryncypall purpose, as in that he layeth falsely to the chyrche that the chyrche doth abuse the sayng of saynt Austayne.
                  And therfore syth he sayth that they mysse construe and falsely alledge all the scrypture, euen in lyke maner wyse as they do saynte Austayne / whyle ye playnely se that in this poynte whyche Tyndale putteth for the sample, the chyrche sayth trewe and hym selfe lyeth: good cause haue you to byleue this lewde felow in the remanauntlyke.
                  But now shall ye se Tyndale deuyse you suche a shyft, that contrary to all his shyftes afore, he shall clerely confesse hym selfe that he both knoweth and byleueth the scrypture by the catholyke chyrch. For now commeth he to his fourth solucyon, wyth whyche he clene destroyeth all the tother thre that he made vs byfore. Lo thus he sayth.

How be yt he well saye that now he neyther knoweth it nor byleueth it by the chyrch, but by the inwarde inspyracyon and teachynge of god hym selfe.
                  
                      And where as his mayster and he many tymes mokke the doctours of the chyrch, for vsyng of trew dystynccyōs in thynges where they be requysyte / hym selfe hath here deuysed an euasyon by meane of a dystynccyon made by Melancthon / in whyche destynccyon as in a myste he weneth to walke away.

                  And in these meanes lyke as god vseth the bodyly senses whyche we call the fyue wyttes, as wayes and meanes towarde that vnderstandynge whyche men attayne by reason, though there be somtyme bytwene the reason and the bodyly senses some debate and variaunce: so dothe he vse bothe the seruyse of the bodyly senses and of the reason of the soule towarde the seruyse of the fayth / addynge therwyth bycause it is a thyyge farre aboue the nature of them bothe, hys owne supernaturall ayde and helpe of hys supernall grace to preuent vs wyth occasyons and mocyons of bylyefe, and walkynge on wyth vs excepte we leue of our selfe to the perfaytynge of bylyefe in our hartes, and  helpynge vs to inclyne oure myndes into the credence of those outwarde causes and motyues, whyche wythout hys helpe in thynges ordeyned of god for the waye to heuynwarde, we sholde not haue done / nor of goddes ordynary course we sholde not haue byleued wythout some such outwarde sensyble causes neyther, as is prechynge and myracles and some suche other.
                  And therfore as I before shewed you, saynte Austayne all be it that without helpe of god he byleued not the catholyke chyrche, nor wythout helpe of god knewe and byleued the scrypture by the catholyke chyrche / yet he alledged vnto those heretykes the Manichays, not that inwarde cause the secrete helpe of god that wroughte wyth hys wyll and hys reason, in geuynge credence to those outwarde causes

for whyche he sayth that he byleued the chyrche / for therin  myghte the Manicheys fayne theym selfe hys matchys, & say that the were inspyred, and that they felte theyr inspyracyon in theyr hartes so felyngly, that therby they perceyued that Manicheus theyr archeretyke was the very apostle of Cryst, and that saynt Austayne eyther had no suche felynge or ellys a false felynge and was begyled.
                  And therfore as I saye saynt Austayne layed them not that inwarde cause, but the outwarde causes of hys byleuynge the chyrche / whyche were so good and effectuall, that the heretykes neyther coulde nor neuer can be able to brynge the lyke for them selfe. And then layeth he the same chyrch by those outwarde reasons so proued trewe, for the outwarde open cause of the knowlege and bylyefe of the very scrypture / and then doth the scrypture beynge by that  outwarde cause, that is to wytte by the chyrche well perceyued and knowen for the word of god, bere wytnesse also & is an other outward cause of the more sure and perfayte knowlege, that the knowen catholyke chyrche is the very trewe chyrch of Cryst here in erth, & that all other are vtterly fayned & false, bothe by the manyfolde textes of the scryptute expressely declaryng it as saīt Austayn sheweth, & also for that very reason sheweth that god gyuynge the gyfte of knowlege which is his trew scrypture to a chyrch, & vnto none but one or by that one, wolde neuer gyue that specyall goostely gyfte and prerogatyue vnto any false chyrche, and than byd the trew chyrche go lerne the trouth of the false.
                  Now good chrysten readers thys waye went saynt Austayne  wyth suche outwarde causes, as myghte of reason lede the reader wyth hym. But now cometh Tyndale and seynge that he can not auoyde the reason of saynt Austayn neyther wyth samples of saynte Iohn̄ and the pharyseys whyche he broughte in dysguysed of dyuers fasshyons to make one answere seme twayne, nor wyth false glosynge of saynt Austaynes wordes wherin ye se Tyndale proued playne false: he cometh now and confesseth that same outwarde cause of fayth vnto the scrypture / grauntyng that hym selfe and euery man ellys knoweth it and byleueth it fyrst thorow the catholyke chyrch. But then flyeth he forth frome the, fayth of the chyrche vnto hys felynge fayth, by which he now knoweth & byleueth y• scrypture as he sayth,

                      and no lenger by the chyrche. And 
                        •
                     herin he playeth by hys felynge fayth, as hys felowes do by theyr remembraunce. For yf any heretyke be taken and examyned vpon his oth of any maner thynge whych he wyll not confesse for hope that it can not be proued, nor dare well deny it for fere that it wylbe proued as whyther he sayd such a thynge or sawe suche a man / he runneth strayt to hys remembraunce, and sayth he sayd it not or saw hym not to hys remembraunce, though it were in le
                        •
                     se then halfe an howre afore. For therin he seeth hym selfe saufe. For though the whole towne sawe them togyther and herde hym speke it / yet whyche of all them can proue whyther he remember it styll or haue forgote it were it neuer so late.
                  And so playeth Tyndale now, beynge fayne to graunte  all that he hath denyed / he flyeth lyke rede Raynarde the foxe for hys saufegarde into his malepardus of his felyng fayth / in whyche though he haue nothynge to proue it, yet the Raynarde trusteth to lye saufe, bycause he thynketh no man can fynde hym out. For who can folow hym thyder to make any tryall what maner fayth hym selfe feleth in hys owne harte.
                  But yet good reders we shall so sette aboute hym, and then sette in suche terryers to hym, that we shall I truste eyther course hym abrode or make hym euyll reste within.
                  For lette vs now resorte agayn vnto the gaye gloryous processe of Tyndalys holy dystynccyon. And where as in the begynnynge therof he calleth the hystorycall fayth a cre

For all be it that in wordely thynges thys tale be trew / yet in maters of faythe, whyche faythe is the fyrste gate whereby we entre oure iournaye the ryghte waye toward god / we canne neuer come at it wythout the helpe

                  Now yf Tyndale call this a felyng fayth: yet were his dystinccyon then clene vaynyshed and gone. For then were euery historycall fayth in maters in the fayth a felyng faith

For in the fyrst, though it were receyued of god, was yet delyuered them & taught them by Moyses that was but a man / & they lerned but o

But in the new law the worlde receyued & lerned of Cryste, whyche was not our neyghbour onely, y• is to wyt very man. But also the maker of euery mannes neighbour, & him self also very eternal god, & ye same techer though he taught before & was ye same god yt before taught by Moyses the synagoge of the chyldren of Israell, and

gaue theym by Moyses a lawe wryten in bokes eyther of  stone or in dede skynnes. yet when he wolde after come to gather hys chrysten chyrch, and teche in hys owne person / he wolde hys owne mouth gyue hys chyrche a lawe wythout booke, and shede out hys grace so meruelouse and so plentuouse vppon the people that thorough the myracles & the doctryne, dede stony hartes sholde waxe tender, softe, & quycke, and wyth wyllyng and applyable myndes, shold by the spyryte of god haue the lawe, that is the trewe bylyefe, good hope, and well wurkynge cheryte, gracyously wryten in them. And thus sholde it haue bene, and by the same spyryte sholde it euer haue cōtynued in the catholyke chyrche, all though neuer worde of the new testament had ben wryten. And yet in the same maner remayneth wryten  in the same chyrche by the same spyryte, a ryghte rule lefte by god, techynge the chyrche to enterprete and vnderstand the wrytynge that hys holy apostles haue wryten after, & hys holy prophetes haue also wryten before. And thys wrytynge from tyme to tyme in the hartes of hys chyrch is the writyng that Cryst so often promised vnto his chyrch / that is to wyt that he wolde sende the holy gooste to teche it all thynge, and to lede it into all trouth, & be wyth it hym selfe all dayes also euyn vnto the worldes ende.
                  Now what chyrch this is there nedeth no man to dowt, when we dowte not whych chyrche it is that hath by god that gyfte to knowe by bylyef which is the trew scrypture / whyche is as me semeth one greate artycle of the fayth.

                      And now ye se perde clerely, that in those wordes of Crys

                  Besydes thys, ye wote well that Tyndale putteth thys felynge fayth to be the fayth of all electes / and than hym selfe denyeth not but that there were electes in euery tyme from Adam vnto Cryste. And thys prophecy that he nowe bryngeth in for hys purpose, was as hym selfe knoweth, spoken of the chyrch of Cryste that shold be after hys own comynge. And how can he than for shame saye, that it was spoken of the felynge fayth of all electes, when they w

                  But this fayth he sayth that those men hadde, was but an opynyon and no fayth, that coulde haue lasted or haue brought oute frute.
                  Now ere we go any farther, how proueth Tyndale this peyce of his purpose, that this fayth in those men was but a bare opynyon / and so faynte that yt coulde not haue lasted nor haue broughte oute frute. How proueth Tyndale  thys? what one word hath he toward the profe? any more then only sayth so? And why may not we then say agayne the contrary? agaynst hym that nothyng sayth, why may we not say that vppon the womans wordes, our sauyoure hym selfe standynge yet wythout the cytye in his manhed was wythin the cytye both wyth her and theym in his god hed, and wrought wyth theyr towarde wyllys in the m

                  ye sayth Tyndaler but yet was it but hystorycall fayth. For felynge fayth coulde yt not be, tyll they spake wyth Cryste hym selfe. For then the spyryt wrought sayth Tyndale, and made them fele. wheruppon they came vnto the woman and sayde, we byleue not now bycause of thy sayeng / but bycause we haue herde our selfes and know that he is Cryste the sauyour of the worlde.
                  what proueth Tyndale now wyth all this? any more, then that theyr fayth was augmented and encreaced after theyr cōmunicacyon had wyth our sauyour hym self? But what is this for his purpose, doth this profe y• theyr fayth was byfore but a bare opinion, and y• it neyther could haue contynued nor haue brought forth frute. Bycause yt was after encreased and made more frutefully, was yt byfore  no fayth at all therfore but a bare fruteles opynyon. Must yt nedes folowe that theyr fayth was chaunged in kynde, bycause yt was augmented in degrees. The apostles thoughte as yt semeth otherwyse, when they prayed oure lorde not to chaunge theyr fayth but to encreace yt.
                  Also in the selfe same gospell of the Samarytanys, the playne texte sayth, Many of the Samarytanis byleued in hym for the wordes of the woman. But Tyndale sayth nay / and sayth yt was no bylyef that they hadde but onely an opynyon, where the gospell by playne wordes sayeth they byleued / & him self sheweth nothyng why he shold say otherwyse, but onely that theyr bylyef was after by the cō
                     munycacyon hadde wyth Chryste more stronge and more fastely cōfermed. And yet fyndeth he no word that none of  them coulde fall from yt after.
                  And therfore these wordis of the gospell reproue ye tone part of his tale, that theyr bylyef was no fayth but an opynyon / & no wordes proue the tother parte of his tale wherin standeth all to gether, that is to saye that those men of Samarye hadde any suche felynge fayth as Tyndale descrybed vs and telleth vs this tale fore / that is to say, such a felynge fayth that could neuer after fayle, lyke the fayth of hete in hym that hath burned his fynger. For where fyndeth he in that gospell or any other, that all those men per seuered euer after in the fayth / and not onely were euer after faithfull byleuers, but also good vertuouse lyuers, and neuer dyd dedely synne but were all fynally saued.

                     e of the ryght bylyefe? well wyll Tyndale say, but yet hadde he but an hystorycall fayth & not the felyng fayth. Now where is then become y• profe of Tyndals tale, y• the men of Samary muste nedes haue the felyng fayth, bycause they spake with Cryste, and coulde not haue so for all the womans wordes, tyll they spake wyth Cryst / yf Cryst spake wyth Iudas mych more then wyth them / & yet had Iudas but eyther hystorycall fayth or els no fayth at all, or finally his felynge fayth fayled  & fell awaye / wherupon it foloweth that there fayleth & falleth away Tyndals hole tale wythall.

                  ye se good reders that these wordes waye, to proue that of necessyte there muste be suche a felynge fayth as he assygneth. For ellys maketh Tyndale as though no man coulde haue any other cause of hys fayth, but the trust that he putteth in the man that telleth hym so / and that saith he is a thynge accursed in the scrypture.

                     te.

These kynde of people do make flessh theyr arme / & not euery mā y• byleueth an other in tellynge of a tale. For they byleue not with theyr arme perde / but as they walke with theyr hādes bycause they cast them not of. But Tyndale that dysdayneth to byleue the chyrche, he is by goddes owne mouth accursed out of the chyrche. For who so (sayth ou

                     But now good chrysten readers I haue declared you  before, that saynt Austayne in byleuynge the scrypture bycause of the authoryte of the chyrche, and all we that do the lyke / do not therby put our truste in man but in god, that by hys inwarde spyryee and outwarde myracles, enclyneth vs to byleue hys chyrche therin / and yet by the same scrypture also confermeth the same bylyefe by hys great promyses therin conteyned and made vnto the same chyrche / and of whyche we se dayly some performed in the same, and the remanaūt therby the more fastely confermed and byleued of the same. And therfore in byleuynge the chyrche, we put not I saye our trust in the men whom we byleue / but we put our truste in god, for whome and by whom we byleue the men.
                  And yet foloweth it nothyng the rather, that there shold  be any suche felynge fayth as Tyndale onely talketh of & no pyece proueth of. For there maye be and in dede is, a ferme and faste bylyefe wythout any other felynge then by leuynge onely, for as farre as concerneth onely fayth. And the fayth of a ryght good man and a very electe, maye be full faste at one tyme, and at an other full feble, ye and fall awaye / and yet by grace and good wyll, come to the man agayne.
                  And therfore is all thys chapyter of hys felynge fayth, bryngynge no profe for hys purpose, vtterly spent aboute nought. And vnto as lytell purpose he spendeth an other peuysshe chapyter after / in whyche bycause he wolde yet fayne haue it seme necessary, that there sholde be suche a  felyng fayth, he telleth vs a longe tale that the fayth which dependeth vppon an other mannes mouth is weke.

                  I meruayle myche that Tyndale addeth not vnto them the Paynems also, as his mayster Luther dyd in the same argument. For the Paynems passed bothe the catholyque Chrysten chyrche, and the false Iewes, and Turkes, and Sarasyns, and the false heretyq

For well ye wote good  crysten reders, that as I haue touched all redy we haue in geuynge credence vnto the catholyke chyrche two maner of mocions / one kynde of outwarde causes such as myght yf the mater were wordely, moue mānys reason to the full agrement and consent therof. And that the tother mocyon is in them that byfore theyr baptysme haue vse of reason, the goodnesse of god fyrste preuentynge them, wyth the occasyons of some outwarde mocyon / and then walkynge and workynge wyth theyr confyrmable wyllys into the cō

And in such as are baptised yong, ye inwarde mocyon is the same goodnes of god preuentynge theym, with the habytuall fayth infoū

Uppon the seed wherof  wyth the good helpe of goddes grace, there spryngeth after in the good and well appliable wyll of man, the frute of credence and bylyefe whyche they geue vnto crystes catholyke chyrche, accordyng to his owne commaundement vppon the preachyng of the same chyrch / in the reasons whyche the same chyrche by goddes good ordynaunces geueth as outwarde meanes of credence and enducynge to the bylyefe, both of yt selfe and of the scrypture & of euery part of fayth, as I byfore spake of and shall hereafter speke more.
                  Now as for thys inwarde cause / we can not bynde the hethen by. For though we tell yt theym / they wyll not byleue vs, or peraduenture tell vs the same tale of them selfe, and saye that god moueth theym.
                  But vn the tother syde vnto all good crysten men thys  thynge muste nedes make yt open, that Tyndale in bryngynge forth for his part the Iewes & the Turkes, to make vs byleue that we maye be as well deceyued in byleuynge the catholyke chyrche syth Crystes days hyther to, that the bokes of the new testamēt be the trew scrypture of god, as the Iewes in theyr Talmud or the Turkes in theyr Alcharon are deceyued in the beleuynge of theyr elders, is a very frantyke blyndenesse.
                  For syth amonge all crysten men this is a playne bylyef, that the chyrche of Criste is gouerned by the spyryte of god in y• trewth, & that all those other chyrches are gouerned be the deuyll in theyr falsed: now is to good chrysten people

                      Tyndals argument none other then euen thys. The chyrches that are gouerned in falsshed by the deuyll that ledeth them into falsshed

                      maye be deceyued and erre / ergo the chyrche that is gouerned in trewth by the spyryte of god that ledeth it into all trouth, maye be deceyued and erre in lyke wyse, syth they be not so many as the false Turkes be, nor haue not cōtynued so longe as the false Iewes haue.
                  Is not thys a substancyall reason trowe you, fyrste for the inwarde causes of our fayth and theyrs / whiche causes arre bytwene vs and them more farre vnlyke, thenne are theyr fayth and oures.
                  And then as for the outwarde causes of our fayth, Tyndale maketh as though we had none other but lengthe of  tyme or nomber of peple, wherin some fase sectes passe vs. But surely yf we were now to talke wyth eyther Turke o

                  But Tyndale wyll happely saye to me therin, as Luther answered the kynges grace, that the Turke wolde laughe at all our reasons. But thys is a wyse answere surely, that we sholde be ashamed of euery reason that the Turke wolde laugh at / and laye for

                  But then cometh he forth in the ende of hys chapyter, and shewed vs that god euer in the olde testament dyd let the great multytude erre reseruynge, all waye a lytle floke to call them backe agayne, and shewe them the ryght way. And so he meneth that god hath now sent hym & hys mayster and those other holy heretykes, to teche the catholyke chyrche the ryght waye.
                  But as I haue sayd before, god hath promysed to sende hys holy spyryte into thys chyrche, to teche it all trouth, & to remayne therwyth hym selfe also perpetually to guyde hys chyrche from suche fallynge of hys catholyke chyrche  from the ryght fayth, that he sholde nede to sende any such coll prophetes as these heretykes are, to teche hys chyrche the fayth / as it appereth well by the olde holy sayntes of euery age syth thapostles dayes, wyth whose doctryne as it is by theyr bookes proued, the doctryne of the catholyke chyrche agaynst all these heretykes agreeth.
                  Also whan he sent hys prophetes of olde, he was wonte alway to sende honest men on hys erand, that proued them selfe by myracles / and not suche rascayle rybauldes as call them selfe apostles, and proue it but by iestynge and raylynge.
                  Goddes messengers were wonte also to teche euery man clennesse and honesty, & not as these bestely felowes do teche folke to breke theyr vowys, and freres to flye forth and wedde nonnes.
                  
                      More ouer yf the trewe flocke be alwaye a lytle flocke / then be not these heretykes now the trewe flocke. For they be now growen not onely to a greate maynye of menne, but also a great shrewde sorte of flockes, flockyng in many countrees of chrystendome full faste, and in many places mych harme haue done, and mych more they go aboute.
                  And therfore syth in some places the heretykes be now the gretter multytude, and the catholykes the lytle flocke: there are then yet (syth the treuth standeth by Tyndales tale in the lytlenesse of the flocke) the catholykes becomen the faythfull folke, and the heretykes the false, wythoute any chaunge of bylyefe on eyther other syde.
                  
                     Fynally chose few folke that god was wont to reserue  or sende to techethe worlde the ryghte waye, dyd agre in theyr doctryne. For ellys had the worlde ye w

                        •
                     hese heretykes be almost as many sectes as men, & neuer one agreeth wyth other / so that yf the worlde were to lerne the ryghte waye of them, that mater were mych lyke, as yf a man walkynge in a wyldernesse that fayne wolde fynde the ryghte waye towarde the towne that he entēded, sholde mete with a mayny of lewde mockynge knauys / whyche when the poore man hadde prayed them to tell hym the waye, wolde gete them into a roundell turnynge theym backe to backe, and then speke all at onys, and eche of them tell hym, thys waye / eche of theym poyntynge forthe wyth hys hande the waye that hys face standeth.
                  
                  Fynally that lytell flocke that god reserued to call the great multitude backe, and to shewe the worlde the ryghte waye / they were euer yet a knowen company. For yf men myghte not haue knowen theym, they neuer coulde haue herde them nor byleued them as folke of the trewe flocke, yf no man coulde haue knowen whyche were the trewe flocke.
                  And then muste it theruppon folow, that yet the trewe chyrche muste be a knowen chyrche and not an vnknowen sorte of electes onely / wyth such an vnknowen kynde of felynge fayth, as no man can fele in hys felowe / nor no man can fele in hym selfe, but he whom all trewe faythfull folke may well and easyly fele for a false fumblynge heretyke, whyche by that false fumblynge fayth feleth that the blessed  sacrament of the aultar the sacred body of our sauyour hym selfe, sholde haue none honour done to it nor be taken for no thynge ellys but eyther for bare brede or starche.
                  But now when he hath so well quytte hym wyth y• false turkes and the Iewes, agaynste the trewe catholyke chyrche of Cryste / he commeth forth wyth an other chapyter / and therin for the fynall conclusyon of all hys mater concernynge the knowlege of the very chyrche, and for the fynall solucyon of the seconde argument made for the catholyke chyrche, and for the fynall confyrmacyan of hys false felynge fayth, he knytteth vppe all hys dyspycyons with these wyse wordes that folow.

                     And concernynge outwarde teachynge / we allege for vs scrypture elder then any chyrche that was this .xiiii. hundred yeres, and olde autentyke storyes whych they had brought aslepe where with we confound theyr lyes. Remember ye not how in our owne tyme, of all that taughte grammer in Englande not one vnderstode the latyne tonge? how came we then by the latyne tonge agayn? not by them, though we lerned certayne rules and pryncyples of them, by whyche we were moued and hadde an occasyon to seke forther, but oute of the olde authors. Euen so we seke vppe olde antyquytes, out of whych we lerne, and not of our chirch, though we receyued many pryncyples of our chyrche at the begynnynge, but more falshed amonge then trewth.
                  
               
               
                  More.
                  Now good chrysten reders, here haue I geuen you all his whole processe to gether vppon an hepe, wherwyth he  endeth all his dyspycyons concernynge the knowelege of the very chyrche. For now after all that ended / he falleth from dispycyons to preachyng, from his mater of the tytle of his boke, that is to wyt whyche is the chyrche, vnto the two great cōclusyons that god hath he sayth wryten in the hartes of all his electes, The tone is he sayth the fayth of Cryste, by whych they knowe how god is to be honoured, and therby they fele & perceyue well inough wythin theyre owne hartes, yt the sacramentes be as Tyndale sayeth but bare sygnes and memoryales, and none effectuall instrumentes of grace, nor the sacramente of the auter nothynge but brede or statche. And the second conclusyon is the loue of theyr neyghbours as them selfe, by whyche they can suffycyently iudge sayeth he betwene good and euyll, ryght and wronge, goodly and  vngoodly, in all couersacyon, dedes, lawes, bergaynys, couenauntes, ordynaunces, and decrees of men / and knoweth the offyce of euery degree, and the dewe honour of euery person / so that by this ye may well perceyue that who so euer haue any lesse knowlege then this, he is by Tyndales owne doctryne none electe.
                  But now syth god hath hym self wrytē these cōclusyons so fully in theyr hertes / Tyndale nedeth not yt semeth to make them so longe a sermon. But as though he fered yet for all his wordes, that god had not so fayre writen yt, but that some of theym coulde not rede yt / he goth forthe wyth his collacyon of a great length, and techeth them after his fashyon what is very worshyppynge, and then a longe processe of images, pylgrymage, sacramentes, and ceremonyes.

                      In all whyche longe sermon he sayth at length nothynge, but eyther such as is so comenly knowen allredy, yt a man may here his wife tell as mych to her mayed, or ellis so folyshe that a very nodypoll uydiote myghthe a shamed to saye yt / or fynally so false and blasphemouse, as scantely the deuyll durste teache yt / sauynge that in the ende he gathereth a lytle his fyue wyttes well about hym, and expowneth there the wordes of ye pore Kentyshman whych I reherse in my dyaloge concernyng Sandwyche hauen destroyed thorow Ten
                        •
                     erden steple. And there to knyt vppe all his whole sermon wyth / he concluded agaynst me that of very trouth the byelding of Tenterden steple and other steples and chyrches in the realme, haue ben in dede the very destruccyon both of Sandwyche hauen, and Douer hauen,  and all the other hauens of Englande, and of all the good bysyde that by good polycy myght in any wyse haue comen an growen to the realme.
                  And thus wyth this goodly quyppe agaynste me for his cum patre qui lakkyng no more but an exhortacyon in the ende that men sholde therfore pull downe Tenterden steple, and so sholde Sandwyche hauen amende, and pull down all the chyrches in ye realme & so sholde nede no more policy to make a mery world: the good godly man maketh and ende of his holy sermon, & gaspeth a litle and galpeth, and geteth hym downe of the pulpet.
                  But for as myche good reders, as all this long sermon of his goth farre from oure present purpose, whyche is as ye wote well onely to wyt whych is the very chyrch / whych  one thynge founden oute answereth and auoydeth playn as hym selfe well perceyueth, all hys whole hepe of heresyes / and for as myche also as the poyntes of his sermon do specyally pertayne to sondrye dyuerse chapyters of my dyaloge: I shall hereafter in answerynge of his partyculare obieccyons, touche in theyr proper places, the deuylysh doctryne of this his holy collacyon. And for this tyme wyll I touche only those wordes that I haue rehersed you and examyne a lytle farther his felynge fayth, and vppon his owne wordes wyll I make it open. And on the wordes of his felowes and his mayster to, that none can be the very chyrch but onely the catholyke knowen / and therwyth wyll I fynyshe all this present worke.
                  Let vs therfore now consydre what great thynge thys

man hath taught vs in this chapyter. To make vs clerely  perceyue y• only electis yt can not synne though they synne, be the very chyrche / and that the catholike knowen chyrch is not the chyrche: he telleth vs here for the fynall specyall profe that this worde chyrch a

And yet is yt for all that the very chyrch? as the arche of Noe was the ryght fygure therof that hadde therin both clene and vnclene, and of the menne also not all electes and good / for of Noe hys awne sonnes one ye wote well was so bad,

                  ye and many very electe is at some tyme full noughte, and many somtyme full good, that yet wyll waxe after nought, and go to the deuyll at laste. And therfore I can wyshe no better for my purpose, then the very thynge that  Tyndale here layeth agaynst yt. For syth that in the catholyke chyrche be both good & bad, and oute of the catholyke chyrche be none good but all bad / as none were saued left out of Noe hys shyppe: this one thynke alone lo euen in the begynnynge brought in by Tyndale hym selfe, is suffycyēt for all the mater for my part agaynst him, as a thynge clerely prouynge that onely the catholyke chyrche is the very trew, and all his other conterfete and false.
                  Now where yt pleaseth hym to ieste and say, Euen so nowe none of them that byleue with theyr mouthes moued with the authoryte of theyr elders onely / that is, none of theym that byleue with mayster Mores fayth, the popes fayth, and the deuyls fayth, whyche maye stonde (as mayster More confesseth) with all maner abomynacyons, haue the ryghte fayth of Christe or of his chyrche: euery man here well seeth howe lowde he bylyeth

                  For fyrste I neuer sayed that any man byleueth wyth hys mouth / whyche though it be the member wyth whych a man is bounden to confesse hys fayth, yet is it not the member wyth whyche a man byleueth, no more thenne his h

                     le. And therfore in thys poynte Tyndale belyeth me onys.
                  More ouer I sayde neuer that men byleue moued with the au
                        •
                     horyte of theyr elders onely / but I say that sauinge for the credence gyuen to the authoryte of the knowen catholyke chyrche, Tyndale hym selfe had not knowen nor yet were sure at thys daye, whych bokes be the trewe scrypture of god. But I say therwyth that lyke as god hath ordered the bodyly wyttes as wayes towarde the vnderstandynge  of reason / so towarde thynges aboue reason he hath ordayned the bodyly wyttes and reason bothe, for wayes towarde the persuasyon. But yet syth the ende is heuenly and so hygh aboue the nature of man, that the nature cor

                     upte, coulde not wythout helpe of god attayne and reche therto: god helpeth forth them therfore that are wyllynge wyth hys supernaturall grace, towarde the inclynacion of reason into the assent and obedyence of fayth / and that the whole catholyke chyrche be it neuer so syke & sore in other synnes besyde, is yet ledde into the trouth of bylyefe by the spyryte of god. And thys is it that I haue euer sayed / and therfore here Tyndale bylyeth me twyse.
                  Now where he sayth that the fayth whyche may sta
                        •
                     de  as I confesse wyth all maner of abomynacyons, is not the ryght fayth of Cryste nor of hys chyrche, but is as he sayth the popes fayth, and my fayth, and the deuyls to / and that the ryght fayth is onely in them that repente and fele that the lawe is good, and haue the lawe of god wryten in theyr hartes, and the fayth of oure sauyour Iesus euyn with the spyryte of god: I saye that the very thynge that I saye of fayth alone, that it maye stande wyth all abomynable dedes, Tyndalys owne felynge fayth feleth and affermeth the sam
                        •
                     . For Tyndale sayeth that hys electes hauynge hys felynge fayth, may and do by the frute of synne remaynynge in theym and brekynge oute at theyr frayle membres, fall in to ryghte horryble dedes / and that yet theyre faythe standeth stylle therewyth and neuer fayleth at any tyme, and that bycause therof all those horryble

dedes be they neuer so greate abomynacyons, he yet no  dedely synne.
                  That Tyndale thus playnely sayth, ye haue your selfe sene in my fourth boke before. And then that it playnely foloweth vppon hys tale, that wyth hys owne felynge fayth all maner abomynacyō maye stande, and howres, & dayes, and monethes, and yeres, abyde and dwell togyther, ye se playnely your selfe. And therfore ye se also as playnely, y• syth I neuer sayd as Tyndale reherseth me, that men may byleue wyth theyr mouth, nor neuer cōmended fayth alone for suffycyēt as Tyndale here bereth me in hande, makyng fayth alone to be myne / and in that I sayd that fayth may be not alone onely wythout other vertues, but stande also with all abomynable dedes and vyce: I sayd but she same & yet not all the same for fayth alone, that Tyndale sayth  hym selfe for hys owne felynge fayth / not alone but accompanyed as he wolde haue it seme, with hope & cheryte both. These thynges beyng thus, when he lyketh hym self well, and weneth he iesteth as properly as a camell daunseth, in callynge it my fayth, and the popes fayth, and the deuyls fayth / euery man I wene that well marketh y• mater, wyll be lykely to call hys propre scoffe but a very colde conceyt of my goffe, that he founde and tok
                        •
                      vp at sottys hoffe.
                  I say to Tyndale yet agayne, that as ferforth as perteyneth onely to the nature of fayth, that is to wyt to the bare bylyefe alone / that fayth that maye stande wyth all maner of ahomynacyon is a very ryght fayth and a trewe. But I saye that though it be as it is, bothe ryght and trewe / yet is it not suffycyent to bryng a man to heuyn, yf it not onely  maye but also do, stande wyth any kynde of abomynable synne, bycause it is than lewd Luthers fayth and Tindals fayth, y• is to saye fayth not alone, but fayth coupled with abomynable synne.
                  But now that fayth alone, that is to saye bylyefe alone is very ryght fayth and bylyefe / is a poynt whyche I haue all redy proued hym mych more ofte I dare well saye then hymselfe hath sayde masse thys moneth / and therfore I wyll not now laboure mych about it.

But fyrst I denye yt euery historicall faith, yt is to say euery hystorycall bylyefe & credēce, is so faynt & so feble, that it is so soone gone as Tindale sayth it is.

                  I saye forther that it is not trewe, that man in the bylyefe  of the artycles of the chrystē fayth, geteth that bylyefe by hym selfe of his own naturall power, wythout the helpe of god wurkynge wyth hym / and yet I speke here of bare bylyefe, cheryte not yet ioyned wyth it.
                  For syth euery man that seketh for the bylyefe, and endeuoreth hym self therto, purposeth therby to seke the way to saluacyon: the corrupte nature of man can neuer begyn to entre into that iournaye, nor walke forth one fote therin, but yf he be bothe fyrste preuented by grace, and haue it walke wyth hym styll.
                        Iohan. 15.
                      For our sauyour sayth, wythout me can ye nothynge do.
                  But lyke wyse as a man maye by goddes helpe that calleth vppon euery man, entre in towarde the bylyefe, & yet leue agayne ere he gete it / and byleue some one poynt and  yet leue of at an other: so maye he go forth wyth god into all the poyntes of bylyefe, and yet leue of and lacke hope. He maye olso go forth in bylyefe and hope to, ye and ouer greate hope to / and yet for the purpose of some flesshely delyte whyche he is not in mynde to leue, he maye leue of and lacke cheryte.
                  For though the deuyll maye besyde such thynges as he verely knoweth, byleue some suche artycles as we do wyth out any preuencyon of grace, for as mych as in him beyng perpetually dampned, the bylyefe can be no furtheraunce towarde saluacion, and therfore can in hym be no mater of the wurke of grace: yet in man to whome the faythe is by goddes ordynaunce prouyded for a waye toward saluacion

                      tough the way be two longe lanes besyde fayth, & therfore he may leue if he lystere he come at any of ye lanys end, that is to wytte hope and charyte: yet neuer can he fynde ye enterynge into the fyrste lane, that to wytte into fayth, nor neuer can he sette forth any fote forwarde in yt, but yf god worke wyth his wyll.
                  For our sauour sayth, no man can come to me but if my father drawe hym. And who so be fallen into a depe pytte, and thens drawen out / is not drawen from the brynke but from the botome. And so lyke wise god that draweth, draweth euen from the begynnynge and casteth downe the cord of his grace to take holde vpon, wheruppon who so taketh hold and holdeth styll / is by god drawen vnto god, and helpeth hym selfe to be drawen. For as saynt Poule sayth, we  helpe forth wyth god.
                  I say also that after that god hath wrought wyth mannys wyll, and called hym by preuencyon of grace at the yeres of dyscrecyon, eyther from Iudaisme or fro gentylyty / and fyndynge no lette in the man, hath by baptysme fully infounded the fayth, and wyth hope and cheryte put hym in state of grace, whych is all the wrytyng in the harte that euer I herde of: this man hauynge nowe not fayth alone but hope and cheryte to, and standynge in suche state of grace, that yf he then so deceaced, his soule sholde forthe with flye in to blysse byfore his body were colde: yet when he doth after that infusyon of fayth and grace, any thefte or auowtry, he leseth charyte alway, & by custome of synne somtyme hope to / and leueth but bare fayth, that is to say  bylyefe alone / and somtyme by false doctrine of heretykes leseth some of that to. Aud yet is fayth alone good to be kepte, ye and the very peyces and fragmentes of the fayth also / for they be meanes by whyche a man maye the more easely come to the remanaunt that he hath loste or lakketh. And they helpe wyth goddes forther helpe, to kepe a man from some synne though they kepe hym not from all.
                  For some man that falleth to thefte, somtyme remembereth yet his baptyme / and beynge by the deuyll entyced to kyll the man, maketh a crosse vppon his brest, & prayeth Crist kepe hym from it / & in aduowtry lyke wyse. And god in that good mynde preuēteth the man by grace, & worketh wyth hys wyll in kepynge hym therefro, as he gaue hym good thoughtes and offred hym his grace yf he wold haue

                  Fyrste there ys yet cause to speke of fayth alone, bycause Tyndale is not an heretyke alone, but yt there be many  mo besyde hym whyche yet saye styll as Luther dyd byfore.
                  Also there is cause, bycause of Tyndale specyally, which wolde glose Luthers olde heresye wyth these new wordes whych wyll in no wyse stande / wyth whych he wold make the world to wene that in fayth alone he ment fayth, hope, and charyte / and that yt coulde not be that he any other ment, bycause there can be none other fayth but onely that alone yt hath both hope and charyte therwith: and by thys bald glose that thre vertues be all one vertue, and that one vertue were thre, agaynst both reason and scripture, wold he mokke vnlerned people, and make them byleue that Luther ment well, and that all other men were so madde that they coulde not vnderstande hym. And therfore to make open this wyly foly of Tyndale, is also a cause why that I  speke so myche of fayth alone, bysydes the necessyte of answerynge hym concernynge his worshyppefull euasyon of his owne felynge fayth, on whych he hopeth that he maye be bold, bycause no man can come into his brest to se what maner of felynge hym selfe feleth there.
                  But yet hath god of his great goodnes begyled hym, & made hym so madde in the brayne, that he hath vttred hym selfe such thynges with his own pēne, as (our sauyour sayenge hym self yt the mouth speketh of the abūdaunce or fulnesse of the herte) muste nedes make euery man to fele euen at his fyngers ende, that Tyndale in the botome of hys harte wyth his fulsome felynge fayth, feleth a foule fylthy hepe of false sumblynge heresyes.
                  
                     For yet is his fayth worse then fayth alone, whyche he  calleth the deuyls fayth and myne. For as saynte Iamys sayth, The deuyls do both byleue & tremble also for drede / but thou (sayeth he to Tyndale and euery suche as Tyndale is, that for his felyng fayth sayth yt he is so great with god, yt he may do many horryble dedes wythout any dedly synne) art worse thē ye deuyll bycause thou doste not drede.
                  Bysydes this, syth Tyndale teacheth suche a felynge fayth as no fayth as he sayth can saue a soule but yt / and then teacheth therwyth all that toward the getyng therof, no man can any more do then the chylde can to the bygettynge of his owne father, that is to say all mos

                  And when he teacheth repentaunce wythout shryft or penaūce & sayth ye shryft is the inuencyon of the deuyll / could he euer haue comen into the felyng of that false fayth, but yf the deuyls owne hand had fumbled about his herte?

For other fayth he putteh none, but such as he sayth is frutelesse / and then teachynge therwythall that towarde the getynge of that fayth (whyche excepte he gete he muste nedes to the denyll) no man can any thynge at all do by good endeuour: he both techeth that it were in vayn for any man to labour for yt, or so myche as pray therfore, or in hys herte onys to wyshe yt, syth he coulde wyth no suche thynge helpe any thynge towarde yt, or forsuch desyre be any thynge the nerer, but syt euen styll and let god

And yf he wyll / the man then shall not nede nor nothyng can yf he wold in tornyng towarde god / no more then the hachette can in a mannys hande, which though it may with the mānys hand wurke vppon the tree, yet canne yt not of the owne nature any thynge helpe it selfe, to moue and turne backe towarde the man.
                  Thys is Tyndalys teachynge / and thys ys hys owne ensample, wherby he sheweth vs that we canne nothynge do in turnynge towarde god, but god doth all alone.
                  And thys dothe Tyndale tell vs and well and boldely dare / no thynge aferde of god that cryeth the contrary by  the mouth of Salomon, where he sayth: Turne agayne thou. Sunamyte turne agayne. And where he sayth also,

                     And euyn in lyke wyse now, when trewe men, catholykes, and good men do persecute theuys, heretykes, & murderers / then are all trewe men, all catholikes, and all good men, playn Ismaelys, Esaus, and carnall / and the theuys, heretykes, and murderers, without any chaūge of purpose to the better, be by and by bycause they be persewed, not for iustyce but by iustyce, turned frome euyll to good, and sodaynly be bycome the Isaakes and the Iacobs and the very spyrytuallys.
                  But now what when the theuys, heretykes, and murderers persecute the trewe men, the catholykes and innocentes, as in Swycherlande and Saxony they do / what wyll Tyndale calle theym than? wyll he call theym by theyr ryghte names and tell what they be worthy? I fere me the turnynge of Tyndals felows to the lefte syde, wyll  alter and chaūge the case, and make hym somwhat to mollyfye and mytygate hys iudgement / and playe as the lady dyd, of whome when one asked what that man were worthy whyche hauynge a fayre yonge woman to hys wyfe, toke her mayde besyde, she gaue sentence shortely and sayd he were wurthy by the mary masse to be hanged by ye necke vppon the nexte bough.

For syth they be hys owne electes, and hys euangelycall bretherne, and felowys of his felyng fayth / he hath perde tolde vs all redy that do they neuer so great horryble dedes, they do yet no dedely synne, and therfore worthy ye wote well but lytle prety penaunce, bycause they consent not to theyr synnes but commytte theym all of frayltye.

But Tyndale wolde here fynde some shyfte to excuse all the rable, rather then to call the persecucyon that heretykes make any maner synne at all.
                  we wyll therfore neuer aske Tyndale the questyon nor make hym no iudge in this mater, le

                  For Tyndale hath here no farther to say in that I can se, to make his tale serue any thyng for his purpose, except he tell vs that as many as came to the lande of beheste, were electes and had the felynge fayth bysyde / and that all those that dyed in wyldernesse, were reprobates, and therfore hadde but the fayth of mennys teachynge and of myracles alone.
                  But nowe is Tyndale tell vs this / we wyll praye hym proue yt. For tyll he do more then say yt / we wyll not lette to say agayn, that with as many as byleued, god wrought hym selfe wyth theyr wylles, and that ellys they hadde not

                      byleued neyther men nor myracles.
                  And we shall not let to tell Tyndale ferther, that of those byleuers whyche were enduced by the meane of men or myracles, there dyed in wyldernesse such as we may well trust to haue bene electes and to be now in heuen / and therfore that they eyther had the felynge fayth yf none other myght suffycyently serue / or ellys suche other fayth as they had goten by the meane of men or myracles, was for theyr saluacyon suffycyent inough. And surely yf it so were / then yet agayne we shall not nede to fere.

                  we myghte here saye that the faute whyche saynt Peter found wyth Simon Magus, was not the fawt that Tyndale fyndeth wyth vs, that is to wyt the byleuynge for myracles and by persuasion of men / but for that he wold with money haue bought the gyfte of the holy goste.

                  He hath gyuen vs playne answere all redy, that there is wyth vs no remedy. For syth we haue so hyghly offended god, not of weykenes, fraylte, and infyrmyte, as hys electes do when they falle into theyr horryble dedes, by y• frute of theyr synne remaynynge in theyr flesshe and brekynge out at theyr frayle members / but euyn wyllyngely, and of purpose, and of pure malyce, whan we endeuour our selfe to byleue the artycles of Cristes fayth by myracles and persuasyon of menne, whyche fayth is as he sayth the deuyls fayth / therfore as for the rest that god is rysen to, he telleth  vs playnely we shall neuer come therto / and therfore byddeth vs neuer loke thereafter nor neuer care therfore, but lette it alone and thynke no more theron, but playe & make vs mery whyle we maye / and whyle we can neuer haue good in the worlde to come, embrace therfore he byddeth vs and holde faste thys present worlde and the pleasurs therof whyle we maye, and be not so folysshe as to lese bothe.
                  Is not here good chrysten readers a good lesson and a goodly gospell of this euangelycall doctour? I wysse saynt Peter answered not Symon Magus so sore ye wote well. But what, syth there is no remedy wyth vs, but that Tyndale wyll nedys dampne vs all in to Dymmynges daie / yet lette vs beseche hym of hys comfortable counsayle for  some other good felowes, as haue bene by grace hytherto kepte and preserued frome suche vngodly cōmynge into the fayth, and haue so well resysted all credence of myracles and all mennes persuasyons, that for any thynge that god coulde do by mene of men or myracles, they stande yet clere aborde and byleue nothynge at all.

                  Now is yt therfore good reason that Tyndale carye vs not away wyth other questyon from this poynte, & deuyse a questyon hym selfe, as why he byleueth that he shalbe saued thorow Cryst. For both is that questyōs not so dyrectly to the mater, and also there maye peraduenture vppon that question arryse a nother questyon, that is whether the saluacyon of any determynate person yet lyuy

                      be in the same person any artycle of bylyefe or not / & some men wyll holde peraduenture that yt is not properly any poynte of the bylyefe but of hope.
                  But therfore lettyng that question passe for this present / 

I shall purpose vnto Tyndales discyple the questyon that  goth next to the purpose, and he shall answere as Tindale teacheth hym. For I am loth to talke wyth mayster Tyndale hym self. I aske his discyple therfore this / syr M. Tyndales dyscyple, syth ye saye that whyche is the very scrypture ye knowe not by the knowen catholyque chyrche as saynt Austayne sayde that he dyd, & Luther also your own maysters mayster sayth that he dothe: I praye you tell vs therfore how do you know that ye bokes of the .iiii. euangelystes be the very scrypture of god?
                  To this questyon ye here how Tyndale standeth at his bakke, and prompteth hym in his eare in this wyse, Say thou byleuest it bycause thou felest yt to be trew. Uery well and properly answered. Then wyll I aske him one questyō or twayn more. wherfore byleue you that no good worke shalbe rewarded in heuen, and that freres may lawfully wedde nūnes, and that the blessed sacrament of the auter is nothyng but cake brede or starche. To all these and twenty suche questyons mo Tyndale teacheth hym thus, Answere thou wotest and feleste yt to be trewe. And when he asketh how thow knowest that yt is trew / answere, bycause yt is wryten in thyne herte. And yf he aske who wrote yt / answere, the spyryte of god. And yf he aske how thou camest fyrst by yt / tell hym, whether by redynge of bokes or hearyng yt preached, as by an outward instrument / but that inwardly thou waste taught by the spyryt of god. And yf he aske whether thou byleueste yt not bycause yt is wryten in bokes, or bycause the prestes so preache / answere no not now, but only bycause it is writē in thyne herte, and bycause the spyryte of god so preacheth and so testyfyeth vnto thy soule. And saye though at the begynnyng

                  Lo good reders here ye se that Tyndale hath instructed his dyscyple to make answere suffycyent to euery thynge that may be asked hym / the whole e
                        ••
                     ecte wherof standeth all to gether in two thynges. The fyrste, that all these poyntes of his fayth he byleueth, bycause he feleth theym wryten in hys harte by the spyryte of god. The seconde that though he came fyrste vnto them by writyng or preachyng and fyrste byleued theym for that wrytyng that he redde or preachynge that he herd, as the Samarytanys dyd for the womans wordes: yet now he byleueth hym not therfore, but onely bycause he redeth yt wryten by the spyryte of god

                      in hys harte.
                  Now for as mych as this outwarde meane of prechyng & redyng, is the fyrst meane by whych he cam therto, which meane he regardeth not now, nor hath no lēger any respect in hys bylyefe therunto / & therfore syth he is nowe comen to that hygh poynte of felynge fayth, by whyche he redeth wryten by the spyryte of god in hys harte, that the bookes of the .iiii. euangelystes be very trewe scrypture of god, he byleueth it not now the better of a poynt bycause the catholyke chyrche sayth so: I wyll therfore aske thys good scoler of Tyndale, whyther he fele wryten in hys harte by the spyryte of god, that he hath a better fayth and a more perfayte than saynt Austayne had, after that god had by myracle turned hym to the fayth and wryte agaynst the Manicheys,  from whose false secte god had called hym.
                  Peraduēture this questyō wyll somwhat seme straūge to this dyscyple of Tyndale, bycause it is none of those to whyche hys mayster hath taught hym to make answere. But yet I thynke in conclusyō y• hys mayster wyll not aduyse hym to saye that he feleth hym selfe to haue a more perfayt bylyefe then saynt Austayne, in any suche thynge as saynt Austayne and he byleued bothe, leste euery man shold fele the mayster of such a scoler to proue a proud fole.
                  Now on the tother syde, yf he cōfesse that he fele not his owne fayth for any more perfayt then saynt Austayns was but byleue in hys owne mynde that saynt Austayne in any trewe poynt of bylyefe commune vnto them bothe, had as full a fayth and as perfayte as he: then wyll I aske hym  wherfore he doth not now byleue the scrypture styll for the authoryte of the chyrche, as well as saynt Austayne dyd styll when he wrote of hym selfe agaynste the Manicheys, and sayd I wolde not byleue the gospell but yf the authoryte of the chyrche moued me therto. He byleued it for the authoryte of the chyrche alwaye styll / and yet dare I saye and Tyndale I suppose dare not saye the contrary, but that the spyryte of god hadde as well wryten that conclusyon in hys harte, as in the holy harte of any dyscyple of Tyndale, whome Tyndale here teacheth, to answere vs the contrary.
                  And thus as concernynge the knowlege of the very scrypture whyche is our pryncypall mater: Tyndals answere in the very chyefe poynte of all, but yf he proue hys

scolers fayth better then saynt Austayns / hys answere that  he techeth here hys dyscyple is not worth a rysshe.
                  But now let vs in those other artycles aske thys good scoler of Tyndale, syth it is so that he feleth and fyndeth in his herte wrytē by the spyryte o
                        •
                      god, that freres & monkes that haue by vowe forsaken flesshe, may lawfully fall from fysshe to womans flesshe, and vnder the name of weddyng make stewed strūpettes of nonnes / and feleth also by lyke felyng fayth, that good workes are nought worth nor shall be rewarded in heuen / and feleth also by the same false felyng fayth, that in the blessed sacrament of the awter there is neyther the precyouse body nor bloude of Chryste, but onely cake brede and wyne or starche in stede of brede: I shall aske hym I saye therfore the questyon to whyche hys  mayster hath boūden hym to make answere, that is to wyt how he came fyrst by thys fayth that is to saye the hystorycall fayth of them, byfore that the spyryte of god wyth wrytynge theym in hys harte, caused hym there bothe to rede them and fele them.
                  For answere of thys questyon, Tyndale sayth to his scoler, Tell hym whyther it were by redyng in bokes or heryng it preched. Uery well. Now syth his mayster byddeth hym tell vs, I wolde praye hym to tell vs, whyther by prechyng or redynge in bokes. To thys he wyll I wene answere me y• he lerned those thynges by prechynge. Then I aske hym by whose prechyng he came to it. To this muste he be fayne to saye, that by the prechynge of hys owne mayster wyllyam Tyndale, Luther, Lambert, Huyskyn, or Suinglius, or some suche  other apostaticall prechers. But now to thys shall I tell hym agayne, that syth he had not the felyng fayth wryten by ye spyryte in his harte after his maysters owne tale, tyll he fyrst byleued the same thinges with an hystoricall fayth by the herynge of those holy prechers / he muste to thentent that he maye lede vs in to the same fayth as they dyd hym, tell vs what reason he had to byleue them / seynge that they be neyther men of more lernynge, nor of more wytte, nor of so mych vertue, as were saynt Austayn, saynt Hierom, saīt Basyle, saynt Cyprian, saynt Chrysostom, saynt Grygory, saynt Ambrose, wyth many such other lyke / whose holy lyuynge, trew fayth, & doctryne, god hath approued & testyfyed to the worlde by manyfolde wonderfull myracles / all which holy doctours haue taught men to beleue y• cōtrary.
                  
                     
                      To this questyon Tyndale techeth hys scoler to make answere and saye, that he byleued them bycause they laye so good authoryte for them. what authoryte laye they for them shall I saye. Now to thys questyon Tyndale hym selfe maketh an answere and sayth, Concernynge

                  Lo good readers thys dyscyple of Tyndale in these artycles of his felyng fayth, that good chrysten mennes good workes shall haue no rewarde in heuyn, & that frerys may wedde nonnes, and in hys blasphemy agaynste the blessed body and bloude of Cryste in the sacrament of the aultare / he byleued hys mayster / and his mayster his mayster Marten Luther, and the other lewde maysters of these newe sectes, not wythout a cause, ye se well. For he sayth that they alledge for theyr heresyes the scrypture & olde auncyent s
                        •
                     oryes / & therwyth as men haue brought vp nowe the trewe olde grammer agayne, euyn so do they now brynge vp the olde trewe fayth agayne / wherof thoughe they toke some pryncyples of the catholyke chyrche at the begynnyng, yet  they toke therof more falshed amonge then truthe.
                  Now which those thynges are that he calleth the falshed that he sayth they toke of the chyrche / ye knowe good chrysten reders well inough, those are the poyntes for whyche he so sore iesteth and rayleth agaynst the catholyke chyrch, the techynge that good wurkes shalbe rewarded in heuyn, and that folke shold kepe the holydayes, & fastyng dayes, & pray for all chrysten soules, & honour the precyouse bo

Lambert, and Huyskyn, and Suynglius, haue restored  agayne the ryghte fayth in all these poyntes, that hath ben thys .viii. hundred yere loste as Tyndale sayth. These thynges haue they now restored and brought vp agayne by antyquytees and old storyes, lyke as mayster Lyly late mayster of Poulys scole broughte vp in London the ryght order in techynge of grammer & lernynge of the latyn tong.
                  Thys is good reders the thyng that thys good scoler of Tyndale by the counsayle of hys mayster answereth.
                  But nowe good readers we must tell hym agayne that hys ensample of grammer and the laten tonge, is nothyng lyke the mater of fayth that he resembleth it vnto. For the laten tonge was no thynge that euer our lorde promysed to preserue for euer / and therfore it myghte by chauncys &  occasyons of batayle and warre, perysshe and be loste / and the countrees compelled to leue it and r

                  And therfore syth grammer in the laten tong is a thyng that may fayle / & the trewe fayth is a thynge by the spyrite of god accordynge to Crystes promyse perpetually taught vnto hys chyrche,
                        Ioh

                  Now as touchynge any such olde autentyke storyes as he speketh of, whyche he sayth the chyrche had broughte a slepe, wherwyth he sayeth that Luther, and Tyndale, and Huyskyn, and Suynglius, confounde our lyes: I wolde very fayne here some one story, by whyche he proueth that fastynge, and prayenge, and almoyse dedes, done in fayth, hope, and cheryte, be noughte worth, nor neuer shall haue

                      rewarde in heuen.
                  By what olde story proueth he that folke shold not pray for theyr frendes soules.
                  By what old story wyll he shew vs, that crysten women be prestes and were wonte to synge masse.
                  By what olde storye can he make yt good, that in the blessed sacrament is neyther fleshe nor bloode, but onely bare brede and wyne?
                  And by what olde stories new founden out, can he now make vs knowe, that freres or monkes professed, were of olde wonte to wedde nunnes, and well alowed and myche commended therin.
                  we be very sure that in all these poyntes except the last, we shall fynde vnto these folke many olde autentyque storyes  prouynge theyr heresyes false. Howe be yt as for the laste in dede, I fynde not as farre as I can remembre any olde storyes agaynste yt. For I suppose veryly that vntyll frere Luther now beganne of late / there neuer was wreche so bestely, that euer durste for very shame attēpte any such incestuouse maryage byfore / but yf yt were onely Iulianus apostata, whyche fell forthwyth fro the fayth, and became a false paynym, and persecuted the crysten folke / and Cryste quyt hym there after, and shortely sente shamfull deth, and the wonder of all the worlde vppon hym whyle the worde standeth.
                  Nowe come we then to the scrypture. For therin they make as though they reygned, we alledge sayth Tyndale, 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         vs the scrypture elder then any chyrche that was these .xiiii. yeres.
                  
                  
                      Fyrste when Tyndale here sayth we / I wolde wytte of hym whyche we, we Lutheranys, or we Huyskyns, or we anabaptystes, or we Swynglianys, or of whyche rable of all the remanaunt of those hundred sectes, of whych neuer one agreeth wyth other, nor neuer a man wyth his felow / but eche of them layeth the scrypture as well agaynste all the remanaunte of the sectes, as agaynste the catholyque chyrche.
                  Bysydes this, where Tyndale saith that they alledge for theym the scrypture / we saye that some thynges there are that god wyll haue byleued, were of his worde was delyuered vnto his chyrche wythout wrytynge, & in his chy
                        •
                     ch wythout wrytynge preserued by the selfe same spyryte that endyghted the wrytynge. And this do we proue by olde autentyke

bokes of olde holy doctours, and by the authoryte  of the catholyque chyrche, and by the manyfolde myracles that styll contynue in onely the same chyrche, for the comprobacion of the doctryne of the same / and besydes all this yet by playne scrypture to / as I haue clerely proued vnto Tyndale in the laste chapyter of my thyrde boke. And sor his purpose in that poynt he hath not one text of scripture, but suche as he may be a shamed so farre agaynst the ryght sence of theym to brynge them forth in place.
                  And ouer this for his fynall confusyon in that poynte, ye haue your selfe herde in my fourth boke, that the perpetuall vyrgynyte of oure ladye he hath hym selfe confessed, that who so euer here yt taughte muste byleue yt / and yet is yt not proued by holy scrypture. And therfore must he nedys geue ouer that false feble heresye, whych he was wont  to holde, that we be bounden to byleue nothynge but yf yt be wryten, & as Luther sayth euydētly writen in scrypture.
                  How be yt in this that he sayth he alledgeth scrypture / he dothe but walke aboute in a maase. For well ye wote good reders, and so doth hym selfe to, that betwene these heretykes and the chyrche, the questyon is not for the more parte in the wordes of the scrypture, but vppon the ryght sentence and vnderstandynge of the scripture. Now do we lay therin agaynste theym the olde auncyent doctours, whose exposycyons they cōtemne. For both for the reward of good workes, and for fastynge, and for the blessed sacrament, and for vowes of chastyte, yf they wolde stande vnto the exposycyons of the olde holy doctours vppon the scrypture / they can neuer auoyde yt, but that the scryptures be  clere for our parte agaynste them / or ellys as I haue often sayde, let Tyndale tell vs some one of so many sayntes, as synnes the apostles tyme haue wryten vppon the scrypture byfore Luthers days, that expowned the scrypture in such wyse, that yt were by his exposycyon lawefull for a frere to wedde a nunne.
                  Therfore in conclusyon as concernynge the scrypture, Fyrste sor suche poyntes as god hath taughte his chyrche wythout scrypture, as the artycle of the perpetuall vyrgynyte of our lady / Tyndale can not teache his dyscyple that they allegge the scrypture / for in scripture yt is not spoken of. If he wyll saye that they be at lybertye and not bounde to byleue yt / hym selfe hath in that artycle confessed the cō
                     trary

                      byfore, as ye haue seen in my fourth boke.
                  And also in all such other lyke, yf he byleue not ye chyrch / he might as well not haue byleued saint Poule. If he say yt he could not but byleue saint Poule, bycause god wrought myracles for hym / by the same reason muste he byleue the catholyke chyrche, for as myche as god contynually in euery good crysten countrey worketh myracles in yt for the catholyque chyrche, and wythdraweth his myracles from all chyrches of heretykes, and therby declareth that he dothe those myracles not onely in yt but also for yt.
                  And also Tyndale knewe not that god by the mouth of saynte Poule sayde so / but bycause that the chyrch taught hym that god dyd so. If he saye yes, he felt yt by the wrytynge of goddes owne fynger in his herte: he muste consyder  that I speke of the tyme before yt his hert was so holy, that god lyked to wryte wyth his owne fynger therin. For hym selfe sayth that the hystorycall fayth goth fyrste, & the felynge fayth cometh after. Therefore at the leste wyse in that tyme, why sholde he not as well byleue the chyrche when yt sayde. This thynge god by saynt Poule dyd tell, as when yt sayde, This thynge god by saynt Poule dyd wryte.
                  And in lyke wyse for the bokes of the wryten wordes of scrypture, of whyche these heretykes receyue suche as lyke them, & refuse such as they lyste / syth yt in the begynnynge sauynge for the catholyke chyrche, they neyther knew the tone nor the tother: why sholde they not byleue the same chyrche as well in the tone as the tother.
                  
                      And as concernynge the bokes of scrypture whych they they them selfe receyue, syth the debate betwene the chyrch and these heretyques standeth not vppon the wordes but vppon the sentence / yf Tyndale were a Turke borne (bycause he layeth so often the Turkes for his parte agay

                  If Tyndale wold now refute myne obieccion of y• Turkes and theyr Alcharon, wyth obiectynge in lyke wyse agaynst me the Iewes and the olde testament, whyche Crist

and his apostles taught theym to constre contrary to theyr  olde vnderstandynge fro Moses dayes to theyr owne, and that the chyrch of Cryste doth euen the same styll / and wyll therfore say that so maye hym selfe and his mayster Martyne, and Huyskyn, and Swinglius, teache the chyrche of Cryste in lykewyse to constre the scrypture of the new testament in necessary poyntes of fayth, contrary to the consent of all the olde exposytours and the comen fayth of all crysten nacyons, syth the tyme of Cristes deth and his blessed apostles vnto our owne dayes, as Cris

                     e and his apostles and the catholyque chyrche teache the Iewes to construe theyr own scrypture of the old testament, that they had had and taught so longe before: I answere Tyndale therunto lettynge passe other answeres for this time, that Cryst and his apostles and the catholyque chyrche euer synnes, haue  proued and yet proue the authoryte of theyr doctryne to be aboue the Iewes in the constrewynge of theyr owne scryptures delyuered by Moses and the prophetes, by that yt hath pleaseth god for the testyfycacyon therof, to shewe by Cryste and his apostles and his catholyke chyrche, contynually to this day many meruelouse myracles, and wythdrawe theym all from the Iewes. Nowe lette Tyndale, and Luther, and Huyskyn, and Suynglius, do the lyke agaynste the catholyque chyrche / & then let them come and teache yt to constre the scrypture of Cryste contrarye to all the olde. But tyll they haue the myracles among them and the catholyque chyrche leseth theym / yf Tyndale and hys fonde felowes wyll in the meane whyle go nowe aboute to  teache the chyrche to constre the scrypture of Cryste, contrary to the contynuall fayth fro the apostles days vnto theyr owne, we may myche better call thē proude presumptuous folys, then myght the Turkes for teachynge them a contrary construccyon of theyr Alcharon.
                  Besydes this, his ensample of the Iewis wyll not helpe hym for a nother cause. For the olde exposytours of theyre scryptures bothe of Moses and of the prophetes, were vppon the parte of Cryste and his apostles, and consequently of the catholyque chyrche contynually agaynst the false scrybes and pharysyes, and the false doctoures synnes, in suche necessary poyntes as they and we vary for / as appereth well by dyuers of theyr bokꝭ, whych be dayly brought forth and allegged by men at this day lerned in theyr own

                      tonge, and also by that substancyall well lerned man Lyre in hys exposycyon of the seconde psalme.
                  Now yf Tyndale, & Luther, & Huiskyn, & Suingliꝰ, can say yt the old holy doctours expositours vpon the scrypture dyd euer expoune it, so that by theyr exposycyon it myghte appere that the scrypture of Cryste appereth it for lawfull and not abhorreth it as a thynge abomynable, that freres sholde wedde nonnes: I wyll agre wyth Tyndale to gyue ouer all the mater.
                  And thus ye se good reders, that as concernynge the scrypture which Tyndale here techeth his dyscyple to say, that they alledge elder then any chyrche thys .xiiii.C. yere, syth the debate and variaunce is not in the wordes wherin they and we bothe agre but in the sentēce / wherin not onely  the comen contynued fayth of all chrysten nacyōs, but also all the olde holy doctours & sayntes euer synnys the same scrypture wrytē agreeth with the catholike chyrch agaynst hym: hys alledgyng of the scrypture is not worth a leke.
                  And therfore is he now dreuen in all that euer we vary for, to leue both scrypture and all / and when he aske wherfore he byleueth eyther thys or that, fayne muste he be to holde hym onely to hys felynge fayth / and as Tyndale for a shote ancre techeth hym, say that he byleueth it onely bycause he feleth it wryten in hys harte, wythout any reasonable outwarde cause wherfore he fyrste byleued it wyth a story fayth, wherof as ye haue herde he can for hys heresyes proue vs none at all.
                  Then syth he is comen to that poynt, that without any  good outwarde cause, he muste defende hys fayth by hys onely felynge / may not the Turkes and the Iewes bothe whome he layeth so sore agaynst vs, defende theyr faythes agaynste hym by the selfe sam? And when he can no ferther saye but that he feleth his to be trew, & eche of theyrs false / may not eche of them answere hym that they fele theyrs to be trewe and hys false? And thus were gone the counsayle of saynt Peter,

                  Men saye that he whyche hath bene onys at Hierusalem may lye by authoryte, bycause he shall be sure seldome

to mete any man that hath be there, by whome hys tale  myghte be controlled. But Tyndale hath here to lye without controllement, wyth lesse labour sought out a shorter waye, and as hym selfe thynketh a surer to. For he goeth not onys out a dore therfore / but saye what he lyste, and tell vs that he feleth it trewe, and fyndeth it wryten wythin hys own harte, by hym that can not wryte false, the spyryte of god hym selfe. And there he weneth hym selfe surer then yf he wente twyse to Hierusalem, and twyse as farre beyonde. For yet myghte he for all that fortune to fynde some man that hadde the same waye walked as farre as he, and there founden Tyndalys tale false. But when he sayeth that he feleth it wryten wythin hys owne harte / he weneth hym selfe very sure. For he thynketh veryly ther canne no  man loke in there to controlle hym and se whyther he lye or not.
                  But yet as wyly as that inuencyon was / Tyndale ys therin begyled / and god hath gone beyonde hym, & made hys wyly foly founden out more playnely then of late appered and came to controllement the selfe same wyly foly in Rycharde webbe.
                  Thys webbe whyle I was chauncelloure to the kynges hyghnesse, was by dyuers heretykes detectyd vnto me, that he had solde and vsed contynually to sell many of these heretykes bookes, forboden by the kynges gracyouse proclamacyon to be brought in to the realme / and ferther I was by good and honeste men enfourmed, that in Brystowe where he then dwelled, there were of those pestylent  bookes some throwen in the strete & lefte at mennys dores by nyght, that where they durste not offer theyr poysen to sell, they wolde of theyr cheryte poysen men for nought.
                  Now beynge thus enformed of hym, and hauynge very sure knowlege that he was a greate medeler in suche vngracyouse maters, and vtteryng of suche poysoned bokes / of whyche I hadde a doser delyuered into my handes by Michael Lobley, whom I hadde attached for lyke maters and whyche hadde receyued the same docer and bookes of webbe and afterwarde abiured hys heresyes. I gaue out a commyssyon to certayne good wurshypfull folke at Brystowe to attache Rycharde webbe. wheruppon after suertyes there foūden to appere byfore me, he went at large / and commynge vppe to London the daye before he came

And whan webbe thought he made the mater saufe and sure there / then came he boldely to me.

For euer for the more parte, he referred and restraynyd all to hys remembraunce. And when he had all done, & saw that I found no fawte, nor nothynge obiected agaynst his answers / but so vsed my selfe as though I byleued them, then he beganne to loke pytuously, vpon me and sayd that he had euer herd, that who so were in hys examynacyon trew & playne vnto me, had ben alwaye wont to fynde me good and fauorable / and sayd that for that cause he had hym selfe shewed me all that euer was in hys stomake, as playnely as he knewe it hym selfe vpon hys fayth to hys remembraūce. wherupon I shewed hym that yf I founde hym trew / he sholde fynde me fauourable / but I fered that his answerys were not all  trew.

And so happed it that euen vppon the day when they shold haue ben made handfaste & ensured to gether / was I aduertysed fro Lōdon by my wyues letter, that Dauys wyfe was a lyue, and had ben at my house to seke hym. wheruppon I called hym before me and other, and redde the letter to hym. Mary mayster quod he that letter sayth me thinke  that my wyfe is a lyue. ye beste quod I that she is. Mary quod he then I am well a payed, for she is a good woman. ye quod I but why art thou such a noughty wreched man, that thou woldeste here wedde a nother? Dyddest not thou say she was dede? yes mary quod he men of worcester told me so. why quod I thou false beste, dydest not thou tell me and all my house that thou were at her graue thy selfe. yes mary mayster quod he so I was / but I could not loke in ye wote well.
                  And as Dauy thoughte hym selfe saufely defended agaynste falsed, by that he coulde not loke into his wyues graue to se whether she were in yt or no / so thought webbe hym selfe surely defended from any reprofe of periury, bycause I coulde not loke into his breste to se whether he remembred  the counsayle so studyousely taken wyth Necton the daye byfore or no.
                  And in lyke maner hopeth Tyndale hym self sure wyth his felynge fayth agaynst all re

                     argucyon of his false heresyes, bycause he seeth that no man can loke into his owne breste but hym selfe, and fynde what he feleth writen there.
                  But now as Dauy my man was bewrayed by my wyues letter, and as webbe was bewrayed by Robert Necton so is Tyndale myche more clerely bewrayed and his counsayle vttered by almyghtye god hym selfe. For where as Tyndale wolde haue vs wene, that he feleth yt wryten in his owne herte wyth ye very hande of god, that freres may lawfully wedde nūnes, god hath him selfe so playnely told the contrary to all the olde holy sayntes this .xv. hundred

yere before, and by all the same space to all chrysten people  besyde, that now there is no good man in all crystendome, but he feleth and fyndeth wryten by goddes hande in hys owne herte, that Tyndale feleth not that fowle fylthy heresye wryten in his herte by the hande of god. But yf he fele yt wryten there in dede as he sayth he dothe / then he feleth yt scrybled and scraped in his herte by the croked clouen clawes of the deuyll.
                  But yet yf the felyng of all good men wyll not answere Tyndale / but that he feleth alway styll wryten with goddes owne hande in his owne holy herte, that the fayth of the catholyque chyrche is but an hystoricall fayth in any thynge that aught is, and that yt is full of heresyes besyde, and that therfore yt is the chyrch of heretyques, as he sayd in the ende of his goodly solucyon to the fyrste argument /  and that therfore they yt go out from it, be as he there sayth the very chyrche. And then syth all they be by hym the very chyrche, all they muste by his definycyon of the very chirch be nedes very electes, and haue by his owne definycyon also the very felynge fayth wryten in theyr hertes by goddes owne hande: I demaunde and aske of Tyndale therfore how yt happeneth that his holy electes & faythfull felynge folke gone out fro the catholyque chyrche, fele not all one fayth / but in great necessarye poyntes of fayth fele eche of them so contrarye fayth to other, that eche of theym feleth other, and eche of them calleth other false fumblynge heretykes / and though the false shrewes conspyre and agree to gether agaynste the trew catholyke chyrche, yet for theyre contrary sectes so vary betwene them selfe that Lutheranys, Anabaptystes, Huyskyns, or Swynglianis wyth many sectes mo, wolde one byte of a nothers nose. And where as they complayne that heretyques be punyshed here / yet one secte there punysheth and kylleth a noher among them selfe.
                  And thus good reders ye may easely se, yt theyr felyng faythes so dissonaunt amonge them selfe, so contraryouse and repugnaunte, be not wryten in theyr hartes as Tyndale sayth by the hande of god, whose spyryte is the inspyrer of vnyte, concorde, and peace / but is as I tolde you byfore, brethed and blowen into the brothels brestes, by the spyryt of dyscorde, debate, and dyssencyon the deuyll.

The tother kynde of fayth, that is to wyt the felyng fayth, he sayth is that fayth that god wryteth hym self in mannes herte, and therfore that is a felyng fayth.

                  Now yf Tyndale saye that in all suche cases god dothe vnto hym that byleueth onys wyth a story fayth, infounde the felynge fayth thereto, except the man haue on his own parte some other let and impedyment of synne: then say I that therby confesseth he that the mannys endeuour inclynyng his vnderstannyng to the seruice of hystoricall fayth, hath yet at the lest wise somwhat more done in him toward the getynge of the felynge fayth: whyche onely fayth Tyndale calleth the ryght fayth, then the chyld can do to the getynge of his owne father. And so lyeth Tyndales tale in  the duste.
                  I say also that yt sholde seme farther by Tyndale, that the hystorycall fayth ones goten / god shold not let of good congruence any more to infounde the felynge fayth into hym, not wystandynge any other synnes into whyche the man in goynge, caryed forth in his frayltye by the rage of concupiscence reygnynge and rulyng his weke sykly members, then he letteth to kepe styll wythout any faylynge at any tyme that felynge fayth in all them that onys haue yt, not wythstandyng all the horryble and abomynable 
                        •
                     edes that euer they can do after. And so shold yt appere by this, that who so gete ones the hystorycall fayth, hath alwaye forthwith the felyng fayth also, though he were in the way towarde the doynge, ye or though he were doynge in dede  neuer so great horryble myschyefe, so that he fall therto for frayltye. And then shall we lakke no felynge faythfull wreches, but ye shall fynde inough.
                  I say also that yf to the hystoricall fayth goten by man, wyth all other good cyrcumstaunces that man by possybylyte may put vnto yt, god doth euer adde and infounde the felynge fayth hym selfe, supplyenge by the congruence of his owne goodnesse the inbecyllyte and lakke of power vppon the mannys parte towarde atteynynge of his owne saluacyon, beynge the great hyghe gyfte of god so farre aboue the proporcyon of mannys naturall state: then is I saye loste and destroyed the effecte of all Tyndales deuysyon betwene hystoricall fayth and felynge fayth. For then

                      euery man that onys hath well the tone, is by & by sure of the tother / wythout whiche hys good workes were toward the rewarde all wrought in vayne / whiche thyng the lyberall goodnes of god coulde not of cōgruence for any lacke vpon hys owne parte suffre.
                  And thus for ye tone halfe of his dyuysyon that is to wyt the hystorycall fayth, ye se now good reders to what poynt Tyndale is brought. And now cōsyder that I speke here of hystorycall fayth, as of the fayth in necessary poyntes of the bylyefe, atteyned & goten by man / by outward meanys onely not that I thynke myn owne selfe y• hystoricall fayth so attayned without the inwarde wurkyng of god, but bycause Tyndale so putteth it, therfore I thus reasone it, to thentent ye sholde therby se what thynge the trouth wolde  wurke vppon Tyndals vntrewe posycyon.
                  I haue also forborne in all this whyle to speke any thyng of the sacrament of baptysme, bycause that Tyndale here in all hys mater of fayth bothe hystoricall fayth and felyng fayth, neuer maketh mencyon therof / as though the sacrament had no parte in thys playe. By whyche obstynate sylēce, men may as wel perceyue what he meneth, as though he spake it out. But yet to make hym somwhat saye therin / we shall in the seconde parte of hys dyuysyon, that is to wytte in the consyderynge of hys felynge fayth, a lytell appose hym therin.
                  I aske hym therfore at such tyme as in the begynnynge there tourned togyther to the fayth two or thre thousande  at onys, as dyd at the prechynge of saynt Peter as appereth in the seconde chapyter of the Actes,

                      and theruppon were chrystened / what toke they by theyr baptysme? hadde they therby bysyde the hystorycall fayth, goten by the prechynge any new kynde of fayth, or new felyng of theyr formar fayth infounded by god in theyr baptysme or not? yf not then as towchynge fayth and bylyefe / the hystorycall faith goten by that outward meane, is as good and as full as the fayth by god infounded inwardly. For I truste that Tyndale doth not thynke but that they hadde suche fayth as was able to serue them to saluacyon, all those that there truely turned, yf they had forth wyth vpon theyr baptysme deceaced.
                  Now yf Tyndale take the tother parte, & answere me yt in the baptysme they had the felynge fayth infounded / then

foloweth it I saye that euery man of age & dyscrecyon whiche  dewly cometh to baptysme, hath the felynge fayth to / syth that he hath by baptysme the ryghte fayth & the fayth suffycyent for saluacyon, whyche is by Tyndale none but the felynge fayth. And then be therby all they that come dewly to baptysme by Tyndals tale electes euerychone.
                  And yet it semeth ferther by Tyndals tale & his mayster Martins added vnto it, yt yf he come to baptysme vndewly that is to wyt walkyng outwarde / yet in waye toward aduowtry, sacrylege, or murder, so he bringe with him bylyef, his baptysme perfyteth all. For by Tyndals grauntynge that god infoundeth snffycyent perfeccyon of fayth in the baptysme, and affermyng that after the perfayt fayth had, the hauer therof may do such horryble dedes & for all that neuer fayle in his perfayt felynge fayth. I canne not as I  sayd before (consyderyng that by Tyndals tale such horryble dedes & such perfayt felynge fayth maye both abyde to gyther) perceyue or se why such dedes beyng yet in ye course towarde the doyng, sholde before let ye perfeccyon of fayth to be by god infounded / any more then they shold after let the same to be kepte & preserued, specyally syth Tyndals owne wurshypfull mayster Marten Luther, sayth expressely that no chrysten man can be dāpned but yf he wyll not byleue. For nothynge he sayth can dampne hym but onely vnbylyefe. For all other synnys he sayth be supped vp and swalowed all at onys in the bylyefe.

                     yth? Not the hystoricall I trow. For ye chyldren haue not yet neyther redde nor herd many storyes. wherfore it must nedes be by Tyndals own tale the felyng fayth. For mo kyndes of faith putteth he not but those twayne, nor none suffycyent for saluacyon but onely that same one / & suffycyent muste the fayth be that the chylde receyueth in the baptysme / for ellys were the chylde neuer the rather saued, in case he dyed as many chyldren do in the chrysome cloth or in the cradle.
                  Peraduenture Tindale gessyng now wher about I go wyll say that in the baptysme god infoūdeth into some the felyng fayth, that is to say into hys onely electes, & in theyr hartes he writeth / & that into some other he infoūdeth it not  and they be the reprobates / & he wyll happely say that it is agred by doctours of the chyrch that god gyueth in ye baptysme not lyke grace to euery chylde.

                  I haue proued hym this poynt good reders, for bycause that vppon this muste yt clerely folowe by Tyndales tale magry Tyndales

                     eth, that the pope, and the cardynales, and the whole clergye, and all the crysten people besyde, be the very playn electes of god, and shalbe saued euerychone as many as euer were crystened whyle they were

                     hildren / and yt they can neuer sinne dedely in all theyr liues though  they do neuer so many horryble dedes, bycause as Tyndale sayth by the felynge fayth euery one that hath yt, is so borne of god and so hath his seed in hym, that he may well do horryble dedes, but he can neuer do dedely synne after. And then doth he mych a mysse to rayle and ieste vpō them ye wote well.
                  Now can Tyndale neuer gete out of this net whyle he leueth, in whyche his folyshe false felynge fayth hath wrapped hym / but yf he refuse not onely the doctryne of the catholyke chyrche of Cryste, but of his owne mayster Martyne antecryste also.
                  And yet foloweth yt farther vppon Tyndales tale also, that syth all the catholyke chyrche haue by his tale the felynge fayth, and therfore are all electes / and then he sayth that the electis hauyng the feling faith, be the very chyrch:

yt clerely foloweth I say by him, that ye pope, & cardinales, and the clergy, and ye whole crystē people, that is to say the knowen catholyque chyrche, is the very chyrche of Cryste / and that hym selfe and his felowes whyche he sayth are departed oute therof as fro the chyrch of heretyques, are not departed out, nor neuer can by this tale of his departe oute of yt in this worlde / but euer hange styll theron as scabbes and bocchys vppon the bodye.
                  And thus ye se good reders to what good purpose Tindale hath by his felynge fayth sodaynly brought his chyrche so clene to the contrary of that he hath folyshely fumbled aboute all this whyle afore.
                  And surely good chrysten reder, as for felynge fayth yf he meane therby faste and sure bylyefe wythoute any mystruste  or doute of the contrary / this felynge fayth is in the folke of the catholyque chyrche and in none other. If he meane by the fayth wryten in mēnes hartes, the faith wherof god worketh wyth mannys wyll into the consent, or the fayth by god infounded into mannys herte: this writynge of god in mannys harte is in the catholyque chyrch and no where elles. If he meane by his felynge fayth, any forther suertye of the poyntes that he byleueth, then onely on vndouted assent and adhesyon therunto: then is yt not fayth / but a nother kynde of reuelacion and an infusyon of knowledge beyond the kynde and nature of the fayth, & a thynge no lesse happy or blessed, but lesse merytoryouse then fayth.

                      And this felynge both concernynge hope and charyte, is in the catholyke chyrche and in none other secte. But what so euer hope those heretyques haue, or felynge

                      of any effeccyon / yt is but Tyndales false truste in stede of crysten hope, and Tyndales false translated loue in stede of chrysten cheryte.

                  And now good crysten reders, ye se to what ende Tyndales felynge fayth is come / wyth whyche dyuyded from the hystorycall fayth, he sayth he knoweth now whyche ys the trew scrypture of god, bycause he feleth yt wrytē in his herte by goddes owne hand / and that he byleueth yt no lenger now for the reachyng of the catholyke chyrch, of whom he lerned yt fyrste wyth a story fayth.
                  
                     But yet ye se good reders that in all this processe of his  felynge fayth, he answereth nothynge to saynt Austayne. For excepte he fele better then saynte Austayne felte, ellys whyle saynt Austayne confessed agaynste the Manacheys, that he wolde not byleue the gospell but for the authoryte of the chyrche / and founde no faute in that saynge when he was after byshoppe at the tyme of his retractacyōs, yt may bycome Tyndale well in that poynte to byleue the catholyque chyrche styll, as saynt Austayne dyd.
                  And on ye tother syde, yf he say that hym self feleth a better fayth then saynte Austayne felt, in the selfe thynge tha
                        •
                      saynte Austayne dyd then byleue as well as Tyndale doth now: then dare I be bold to say that euery man and womā yt any felyng hath, can not fayle to fel Tindale for a proude fumblynge fole.
                  
                  And that he so is in dede / ye shall yet the more fully fele by this. For yf yt were all trew that he sayde / yet hath hys owne wordes double proued, that the knowen catholyque chyrche is the very chyrche of Cryste. Fyrst in that I haue vppon his owne wordes proued you, that yf he sayde trew, yt muste therof nedes folowe that all crysten people beyng baptysed in childhed, must haue the felyng fayth / and then were they by his owne dyffynycyon the very chyrche.
                  Secundly now consydre well this good reders, that as he sayth he byleueth not now no lenger whych is the trew scrypt
                        •
                     re, bycause the chyrch so teacheth hym, but bycause he feleth yt writen in his herte by ye spyryte of god: so sayth he that in lyke wyse he byleueth not now no lenger any artycle of the fayth bycause he fyndeth yt in the bokes, but bycause  he feleth yt wryten in hys owne harte by the spyryte of god.
                  Now sayth Tindale not nay, but that as he came fyrst to the knowledge of the artycles of the fayth by the preaching or redynge of the bokes of the scrypture / so came he fyrste to the knowledge whych was the scripture by the teachyng of the knowen catholyque chyrche.
                  Now say I therfore, that graūtyng hym to say well and trew in that he sayth be byleueth no leger now the artycles of his fayth for the bokes of the scrypture, nor byleueth the scrypture to be the trew scrypture for the teachynge of the catholyke chyrche / yet foloweth yt for all that, that in lykewyse as that by the preachynge or redynge wherof he fyrst

                      came to the byleuynge of the fayth, is the very trewe scrypture / so is the knowen catholyke chyrche by whych he fyrst came into the byleuynge of the scrypture, and by whose techynge he toke it and percey
                        •
                     ed it for holy wrytynge and for the very scrypture, the same chyrche is in lykewyse I saye the very trewe chyrche, syth that orygynally the scrypture is knowen as Tyndale hym selfe confesseth by none other chyrche / as the fayth is orygynally lerned by none other scrypture.
                  And thus good christen readers to make an ende of this boke / here ye clerely se that I haue not onely reproued you clerely Tyndals false felynge fayth, and auoyded hys solucyon playnely, by whyche he wolde auoyde that argument that clerely proueth the catholyke knowen chyrche to be  the very chyrche of Cryste, by that the trewe scrypture is knowen by the same chyrche and none other: but I haue also yet onys agayne clerely proued you the comon knowē catholyke chyrche to be the very chyrche of Cryste, by the ve
                        •
                     y wordes of Tyndale hym selfe, wyth whyche he wolde proue the contrary. For thys argument by whyche the knowen catholyke chyrche is proued the very chyrch, whyche argumēt Tyndale hath all thys whyle bumbled about to soyle / abydeth in conclusyon so stronge and ineuytable, that in the laborynge to soyle it Tyndale hath double confermed it.
                  And surely thys is no meruayle. For where as all heretykes very well perceyue, that by the playne promyses of our  sauyour hym selfe clerely cōtayned in the gospell, hys chyrche can neuer be brought into any dampnable errour / and that yf it myghte,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      there were no suerty neyther of doctryne nor of the scrypture selfe, & on the tother syde yf they sholde graunte the doctryne of the catholyke chyrche to be trewe, then were all theyr heresyes drowned: for thys cause lobeynge dreuen to confesse that the chyrche can not fall into dampnable errour, they be dreuen to seke aboute for some other chyrche, bycause the sure treuth of the chyrch dampneth & destroyeth theyr heresyes. And yet was there neuer any of them but that in goynge frome the knowen catholyke chyrche to seke out another, he walked so wyld about, that who so loked on and byhelde hym, wolde saye the man were blynde / and eche walketh a dyuerse waye, & assygneth a dyuerse chyrche, neuer one lyke another.
                  
                     And for ensample ye maye consyder twayne / Tyndale  for one, whose chyrche ye haue harde all redy.

               But yet muste this great godly man, this hygh and holy heretyque, holde hym self cōtent to knowledge at length  this same comen knowen catholyque chyrch to be the very chyrch when he hath all done / whyle as hym self hath here rehersed you, this comen chyrche of good and badde is the chyrche that saynte Poule hym selfe calleth the chyrche of god. whyche one place of saynte Poule of Barons owne bryngynge forth, destroyeth vtterly Barons whole purse, but yf the chyrch of god be not the chyrch of Cryste, and excepte Cryste be not god.
               It is also to me great meruyle, wherfore frere Barons sholde so hyghly dysdayne the knowen catholyque chyrch, bycause there be murderers and theuys, and whores and baudes therin, whych he sayth men know not / whyle there is neyther Luthers chyrche, nor Huyskyns chyrche, nor

                   Swynglius chyrch, but that they haue of all these people plentye, suche as be knowen well inough. And yet those chyrches he neyther iesteth nor rayleth vpon, as he doth vppon the catholyke chyrche / out of whych all these chyrches are departed and caste oute / into some of whyche chyrches Barons is hym selfe come now.
               And as for whores and baudes / all the worlde knoweth I suppose that the hed maysters the archeheretykes of all theyr sectes, are the chyefe whore maysters beynge prestes, munkes, and fre

Of all whome, but yf they be bysyde theyre whoredome and baudry bycomen euangelycall systers of these heretycall sectys / there is I truste not one, but they knowledge theyre suche

And that y• deuyll hath taught hym thys lye appereth playnely by many a playne place of scrypture. As where our lorde sayeth by the mouth of hys holy prophete Esaye:
                     Esaic. 1.
                   Be ye wesshed, be clene, and take a waye out of my syghte the euyll of your thoughtes. And by  the mouth also of the prophete Ezechyell:

And agayne in the same psalme:
                     Psal. 33.

               These thynges lo doth the knowen catholyke chyrche teche, and in thys wyse do they interprete and declare the

But he meneth therin that man maye towarde remyssyon meryte no thynge at all / nor that no merytes of man shall haue any rewarde in heuen, but that all to gether standeth in fayth alone / whyche lyes he hath as I sayed lerned of the deuyll alone.
               And that he thus meaneth hym selfe well declareth by his madde poysened processe, that all onely fayth iustifyeth before god.

               Now where he sayth that all the blessynges and all the holy water, can not clense a man nor gyue hym remyssyon: thys lerned he of the knowen catholyke chyrche, as farre forth as it is trewe. For none of all these neyther the men nor the thynges can do any good of them selfe as of them selfe. For so sayth saynt Poule:

                   we be not suffycient of our selfe as of oure selfe. For theffecte and effycacy of all these thynges, cometh of god. But frere Barons meneth that there is in all the blessynges, and all the holy water, & holy  brede, and so forth in all the ceremonyes, and almoste all y• sacramentes vsed in the knowen catholyke chyrche, none effycacye at all. whych lye the deuyll and the deuyls lymmes haue taught hym.

And as for holy orders, that at the geuynge of them grace is infounded into the persones that receyue them / the fyrst pystle to Timothe and y• second both, do playnely proue. In the fyrste pystle, saynte Poule sayth thus: dyspyse not the grace which is in the, that was  geuen vnto the by prophecye, wyth the layeng of the handes of pres

                   I warne the to resuscytate and sterre vppe the grace, that is in the by the laynge of my handes vppon the.
               Now that I haue good readers opened vnto you the couert purpose of Barons deuelyshe doctryne, planted in amonge his mokkes and his iestes / & that there is nothyng well and trewly sayd in all his processe, but that he hath lerned of the playn comen teachyng of the knowen catholyke chyrche: let vs examyne and cōsydre now the chyrche that he dyffyneth vs / and then se whyther the authoritees that he alledgeth here of saynt Poule and saynte Austaynte do proue vs the chyrche that he promyseth.
               
                  The very trew chyrche is sayth he, pure and clene with  out spot or wryncle.
               Also the very chyrche is of goddes eleccyon.
               Also they that byleue that Chryste hath weshed theym from theyr synnes, and stykke faste vnto his merytes and to the promyses made to theym in hym / onely they be the chyrche of god, and so pure and so clene, that it shall not be lawfull, no not for saynt Peter to say that they be vnclene. Also the holy chyrche of Cryste is nothynge elles, but that congregacyon that is sanctyfyed in spyryte, redemyd with Crystes blood, and stykketh faste and sure all onely to the promyses that be made therin.
               Now se ye well good reders, that the chyrch whych Barons here assygneth, is all pure and clene / and not onely  hath no theues nor murderers, nor whores nor bawdes therin / but is also so pure that not saynte Peter hym selfe may be so bolde to fynde any faute in any man of this congregacyon. But the causes why / be bycause they be all of goddes eleccyon, and all washed and made fayre by god, and sanctyfyed in spyryt, and redemed with Cristes blood, and stykke all faste onely to the promyses.
               Remember now good reders, that yf frere Barons abyde by his descrypcyon: then is there no man in the very chyrche but onely at suche tyme as he is so clene and pure wythout spot or wrynkell, that saynte Peter may fynde no fa

                  te in hym. And then be there in dede very few of yt and very seld. And yf any man be of yt / one selfe man is peraduenture of the chyrche and not of the chyrche seuen tymes  in a day. For as the scrypture sayth, Seuen tymes falleth the ryghtuouse man and shall aryse agayne. And therfore this chyrche can no man know to lerne any thynge of her whyche he may reken hym selfe the surer of, bycause thys holy chyrche teacheth yt hym.
               But therto answereth Barons and sayth, This chyrche is a spyrytuall thynge and no exteryour thynge, but inuysyble fro carnall yi

                     nowledge of her.
               
               This is somwhat straunge, that this chyrche sholde be inuysyble, when yt is made all of men and women, of whyche euery one is vysyble. But therto answereth also frere Barons and sayth, I say not that they be inuisyble that be of the chyrch, 
                        •
                     ut that holy chyrche is her selfe inuysyble.
               
               
                  
                   Then aske we hym what is holy chyrche her selfe / and to that answereth he nothynge, but that holy chyrche her selfe is a congregacyon of good crysten men and good crysten women, of whyche euery one is vysyble, but the congregacyon of them is inuysyble.
               Uery well declared, as though he wold tell vs that there were a woman that went inuysyble, and that he ment not that her handes, or her fete, or her hed, or any parte of her were inuysyble / but all her partes beynge vysyble, her self were yet inuysyble. And as he myght tell vs, that of Poules chyrch we may well se the stones, but we can not se the chyrce. And then we may well tell hym agayne, that he can not se the wood for the trees.
               To say that the whole thynge is inuysyble, wherof he  sayth we may se euery part, is a thyng aboue me pore wyt / and I suppose aboue his to, to make his saynge trew.
               But peraduenture he meaneth yf he coulde speke, that though we may se yt, we can not know yt, bycause he sayth yt is spyrytuall. For I may se a man that is spyrytuall, & yet not know hym for spyrytuall, as a man myghte haue sene frere Barons when he came laste into the lande by the kynges lycence, and yet myght happely not haue knowen hym, all though he had knowē hym byfore, but haue taken hym for a monstre / he hadde so monstrousely dressed hym self bycause he wold be wōdred on. And yet when he waxed after a shamed of hī self, bycause he could no better answer for his heresyes, and that his false folyshe hope had fayled hym: he shaved his berd and went lyke a merchaūt of elys  skynnys. And then a man myght haue met hym, and vpon his name rehersed, myght haue knowen hym for Robert Barons, and yet not know hym for a frere. But yf he had ones knowē hym for a frere, he myght then vpon the syght haue knowen hym for an apostata.
               But as farre forth as cōcerneth syght / a spyrytuall man is no more inuysyble in this worlde, then is a carnall / and therfore the spyrytuall chyrche may be sene, though the spyrytualyte therof be not sene, nor yt vppon the bare syghte perceyued and knowen for suche.
               But I wyll not stryue myche wyth frere Barons for a worde. The man is so sore bysyed aboute his rethoryque, that yt is no meruayle though he can not entende to speke reason nor trew english neither / as appereth where he trāslateth

lernynge for teachynge, in his fyrste declaracyon of  this worde ecclesia, rehersynge the wordes of saynte Poule to the Corynthies thus: I haue sent vnto you Tymothe, the whych shall lerne you my ways that be in Cryste Iesu, as I do lerne euery where in all cōgregacyōs. As though saynt Poule had lerned in euery congregacyon where he came, and euery man taught hym and not he theym. And though that some vnlerned vse this worde lerne for thys worde teache, wyth his accusatyue case set out, as Rychard lerneth Robert: yet saith no man but Barons, Rychard lerneth at Oxforde, for Rycharde teacheth at Oxford.
               But this is specyally to be noted that he sayth after, that this chirch / can not erre / she cleueth so fast to y• word of god that is the veryte. And for this cause he sayeth that saynte Poule calleth her the pyller and ground of trouth / not that  she is so sure of and in her own strenght, but that she stykketh so faste to the lyuynge god and to his blessed word.
               Now good reder consyder that no man sayeth that the chyrche hath his suerty of yt self / but of god and of his spyryte euer abydyng in yt, accordynge to the manyfolde promyse of Cryste / and therfore we nede not frere Barons to tell vs this tale.
               But consyder now well agayn, that B
                     •
                  rns here grauntynge that the very chyrche can not erre, but is as saynte Poule sayth the pyler and grounde or fote of the pylare of trouth because it cleueth to god / ought here to ponder that this worde,

                  e of a chyrche is borne vppe from ruyne and fallynge, by the pylers vppon whych yt resteth. And therfore these wordes of saynt Poule sygnyfye not onely that the chyrche can not in yt selfe fall into the ruyne of dampnable errour, but also that lyke as the pyler is a sure thynge for an house to reste vppon, and the grounde or fote of the pyler called in laten ba
                        •
                     is, whyche is the thynge that Barons mysse translateth here the grounde, is the thynge wheruppon the pyller standeth sure / so is the chyrche the pyller and the fote or groūd of trouth, vppon whose doctryne euery man may reste and stande sure. And for this cause doth the holy doctours vse

                   and alledge those wordes, to proue therby not onely that the chyrche can not damnably erre in yt selfe, but also that therfore euery man surely may and of dutye must, geue credence to the chyrche and byleue yt, and lene therunto as vnto a sure pyller, and stande fast theruppon as vppon a sure fote of a pyller that can not fayle.
               Now good readers, yf the very chyrche whych can not erre, be a cōgregacyon inuysyble, and a cōpany vnknowē / though euery one of them haue the very treuth in him self: yet yf I can not know that chyrche, I can not lene to that chyrche as to a sure pyller of trouth, syth I can not knowe it for the very chyrche though I sholde happen on it.
               And thus ye se good reders that frere Barns vnknowē chyrche, can not be the pyler nor the grounde of trouth for  any man to reste vppon / but that the chyrche whyche saynt Poule as Barns hym selfe reherseth calleth the pyler and grounde of trouth, must be a knowen chyrche. and therfore thys texte of saynt Poule that he bryngeth, playnely proueth agaynste hym.
               Now consyder also good reders, that frere Barns in all thys hys descrypcyon and dyffynycyon of the chyrche of Cristes electes, putteth onely these propretees. Fyrst y• they be goddes electes / secundely that they be wasshed of god from theyr synnys / and thyrdely that they be redemed by Chrystes bloude / fourthely that they stycke faste vnto hys merytes onely / fyfethly that they stycke onely to goddes promyses made in Chrystes bloude / syrtely that they be sanctyfyed in spyryte / and fynally for the seuenth, that they  be clene and pure wythout spotte or wryncle, so farre forth that saynt Peter hym self may fynde no fawte wyth them.
               Now fyrste as for the eleccyon / frere Barns playeth as Tyndale doth, walketh in the darke bycause he wold not

                  what thynge fyndeth frere Barons for hys purpose in these wordes? saint Poule here exhorteth men to loue theyr wyues, so tenderly that they sholde be of the mynde, that to brynge them to heuyn they coulde fynde in theyr hartes to dye for them, as Cryste hath dyed for the Crysten people to brynge them to heuen / & that men, to that entent that they maye brynge theyr wyues to the gloryouse blysse of heuyn, sholde here brynge theym well vppe in fayth, in hope, and charyte, and in good workes, lyke as god hath washed his chyrche of all chrysten people, and hath clensed theym by the water in the worde of lyfe, that is to wyt by the sacrament of baptysme.
               Thus hath god geuen hym self to the deth for his chirch of all Crysten people. to thentent that the sacrament of baptysme  myght weshe them all and clense thē from all theyr synnes. For wythout his deth the sacramēt shold not haue hadde any effycacye to clense them. But why hath he by the sacrament of baptisme, clensed his chyrch of all cristen people / and by the infusion of his grace in fayth, hope, and charyte, sanctyfyed them in spyryte? surely (as saynte Poule sayth) to thentent that he myghte make her to hym selfe a gloryouse chyrche wythout spot or wryncle / that is to wyt, that they myght and sholde perseuer in vertue, and yf they fall then ryse agayne by penaunce / and thus in good workes of charyte and worthy frutes of penannce, so lyue here wyth his grace, that he myghte after this worlde brynge them to his glory and there haue them a gloryouse chyrch fyrst in soule and after in body to / where they shall neyther  haue spot nor wryncle neyther of synne gret nor smale, nor spot of corrupcyon in the body, nor wryntle of

                  yspleasure in the soule, but the tone incorruptyble, the tother impassyble, bothe twayne in ioy and gloryouse blysse wyth god eternall.
               And this ment there sent Poule / not that the chyrch shal here in this worlde endure and contynue wythoute spot or wryncle of synne, so clene and pure that saynt Peter could fynde no faut therin / and that as sone as a man had eyther spot or wryncle, he were by and by none of the chyrche of Cryste in erth. For this I wote well, that saynt Poule hym selfe called the congregacyons to whyche he wrote the chyrches of Cryste, and calleth them sanctyfyed in spyryte / and yet maketh them not sure that they shall cōtynue holy / nor

               Then he sheweth that Liranus sayth the chyrche standeth not in spyrytuall power or secular dygnyte, but in confessyon of Cryste and hys blessed veryte / and no man fyndeth fawte wyth Lyre for so sayenge / but we fynde fawte wyth frere Barons for teachynge false heresyes in stede of Chrystes blessed veryte.

                     •
                  urer way, and rydde hym self with only Tyndales rydelles of synnynge and yet not synnynge, and errynge

and yet not errynge, and leue oute those other poyntes  / and walke so myche more in the darke then Tyndale doth, though Tyndale kepe hym selfe in the darke more then metely well.
               For now to proue vs all his whole purpose, that there is in erth here a chyrche and a company that be clene wythout any spot or wryncle of synne, & that so clene that saynte Peter may fynde no faute / obiectynge agaynste hym selfe the thynge that he seeth well euery man wolde, that ys to wyt that both by comen experyence of the peple, and by the playne worde of god the contrary of his posycyon and purpose appereth euidently trew: he answereth in conclusyon therunto, that the cōgregacyon whych he calleth the chyrch euer hath spottes and wryncles of synne, and that yet yt is for all that very pure and clene, bycause that for her abydynge  in the knowledgynge of her spottes and wryncles of her synnes, and askynge mercy for theym, god layeth nothynge of them to her charge.
               Consyder now for goddes sake good reders, how perfytly frere Barons hath answered you, and howe perfytely he hath proued his p
                     •
                  rpose. He promysed vs you wote well to proue vs a chyrche pure and clene wythout spot or wryncle / and now he bryngeth vs a chyrch pure and clene as he sayth wyth spottes and wryncles both. Is there any man so bare wytted, that can so be satysfyed and thynke hym selfe suffycyently answered thus?
               I hadde as lyue he told vs that yf there were a woman with a croked nose, as longe as no man tell her of it so lōg  her nose stode ryght. For by hym though god lay neuer her spottes nor her wryncles to her charge, but is alway wasshynge her spottes, and alwaye stretchynge out her wryncle: yet he confesseth that for all the washynge and all the stretchynge, as longe as she lyueth she is neuer wythoute them. And his promyse ye wote well was, to proue vs a chyrche not pure and clene wyth them, but pure and clene wythoute them.
               Now where he sayde the chyrche is so wythoute spotte, that saynte Peter myght fynde no faute in her, he begyled me. For I hadde went she sholde haue had none for saynte Peter to spye. And I meruayle what he ment by y• word, yt shall not be laufull saint Peter to fynd any faut in her. For I thought that yt wold

                  lway be lawfull for saynt Peter

                   to saye trewe, and to call a spotte a spotte, and a wryncle a wryncle in her all the whyle she hadde any / and that is as Barns now confesseth in conclusyon all the whyle she is here. But now ment Barns all thys whyle as it appereth farre of another fasshyon, that is to wyt that she shold euer haue spottes and wryncles whyle she lyueth in erth / but yt saynt Peter maye not be suffered to tell her so / for yf any man wolde laye her spottes and her wryncles to her charge then is Cryst sayth frere Barns redy to gyue her hys clennesse, and to lette her by fayth clame of ryght hys purynesse for her owne / and whyche fayth meneth he? fayth alone of lykely hed for all onely fayth iustyfyeth he sayth.
               But yet good readers ye wote well for all thys tyll she come there as she shall be gloryouse, whyche is in heuyn &  not here / and vnto whyche though the chyrche shall in conclusyon come, yet shall not euery man come that is at any tyme parcell, a member of the chyrche, no more then though the chyldren of Israell came in conclusyon to the lande of byhest / and were dyuers tymes delyuer

                  d agayne oute of thraldome / that it therfore folowed that all came thyder, but many dyed in desert: yet in the meane whyle I say tyll god hath so fully gyuen her his clennesse and his purynes, that he hath fully wesshed out all her spottes and strecched out all her wryncles, & made her gloriouse in heuen / where as saynt Poule sayth,
                     
                        〈1 paragraph〉
                     
                   who shall accuse the chosen of god / as who say no man can / ellys whyle she is yet here in erth not gloryfyed, nor her spottes fully wesshed out / but be in  wesshynge, nor her wryncles fully strecched out / but be in strecchynge / and whyle as faste as her husbande wassheth she spotteth, and as faste as he streccheth she wryncleth: I can not in good fayth se why saynt Peter sholde be af

                  rd / or by what lawe it were vnlawefull for hym to saye for the tyme the thynge that for the tyme is trouth, that is to wyt that she is not yet pure & clene wythout spotte or wryncle.
               And thus good reders yet ye se onys agayne that frere Barons proueth nothynge the chyrche that he promysed bnt when in stede of one pure and clene wythoute spotte or wryncle he bryngeth one, not so clene but that she is spotted and wryncled / he wolde wynne the felde wyth a face, & make saynt Peter aferde, to call her spottes spottes, or her wryncles wryncles. But it wyll not be Barns, it wyll not be. For though saynt Peter whyle hym selfe was of ye very chyrch here in erth / and therfore yet wryncled and spotted,

and so sore fered reprofe, that at the worde of a woman he  was aferd, to loke a gyrle in the face / yet now that he is gloryfyed in the chyrche in heuyn / and all hys spottes wasshed clene out, and all his wryncles clene streched out / he is now so farre out of all fere of reprofe, that the thonder of youre greate worde can not lette hym to saye trewe, for any fere of your gargyle face, that ye came dysguysed wyth, at your laste resortynge hyther.
               But now let vs consyder sumwhat of frere Barns holy prechynge by the waye, whyther it be so holy as he wolde haue it seme.
               The cause he sayth why thys chyrche is here so holy, pure, and clene, wythout spotte or wryncle / and yet hath he sayth euer spottes and wryncles, whyle it is in this worlde / is he  sayth bycause god hath chosen it wythout any merytes of her, and bycause she knowledgeth her fautes. Here muste we consyder alway good reders, that he putteth the chyrch to be all of good folke and none euyll, nor dedely synners therin / for that is ye remember well the dyfference bytwene the comon knowen catholyke chyrche and hys / that the catholyke chyrche of Cryste here in erth, hath in it bothe good and bad / and frere Barons chyrche hath none in it, but so good, so clene, and so pure, that there is not an euyll man therin / but though they neuer lacke spottes nor wryncles, yet theyr spottes be no spottes, nor theyr wryncles be no wryncles, or at the leste wyse though they be / yet saynt Peter maye not be so bolde to call them so / bycause them selfe knowledge them to be so.
               
               Now as for that he speketh of eleccion and merytes / w

                   wyll not mych medle wyth hym. For we agre that god cheseth by preuencyon of grace, euery man yt he taketh to hym before the man maye any thynge meryte, whyche can wyth out grace nothynge meryte. But after may man by fre wyll wurke wyth grace and helpe, to meryte rewarde in heuy

                   by good wurkes wrought in fayth and cheryte, and not in fayth alone, what so euer frere Barns agaynst fre wyll and good wurkes bable to the contrary.
               But now concernynge that he speketh of satysfaccyon, and that Cryste is our satysfaccyon / the wordes are good and trewe: for Chrystes deth is able and suf

                  ycyent, and so is the leste drope of hys bloude for the satysfaccyon of the synnys of all the whole worlde, and many be wythout any

                   other satysfaccyon saued, as be all the chyldren that after baptysme dye in theyr cradels. But god hath not so ordered yet / that euery man which hath age & dyscrecyon shold so trust vnto that satysfaccyon by whyche Cryste wyth his passyon satysfyed for all mennes synnes at onys / that he sholde for hys owne synnes by the frutefull wurkes of penaūce make no satysfaccyō hym selfe no more then he wold though Cryst be our aduocate & pray for vs, that we shold therfore be the more slacke & remysse in prayenge also dylygentely for our selfe. For he byddeth &
                     •
                   teacheth vs also to praye, & that without ceacyng & fayntyng. Nor he taketh it not for foly nor for synne y• for the honour we bere to god, we honour and praye to the sayntes also that are hys frendes, to be intercessours for vs / agaynste whyche frere Barons  hath made as very a folysshe processe as euer dyd heretyke that spake on that parte, syth that heresye fyrste beganne / and no le

                  se folysshely speketh he in many places agaynst satysfaccyon & agaynst all the sacramēt of penaūce.
               And therfore where he sayeth that the chyrche is made clene and pure, by knowledgynge her synnys: it appereth well that though he speke the same wordes, that saynt Austayne spake / yet he meneth not as saynt Austayne ment. For saynt Austayne in dyuerse other places declareth, that a synner sholde knowledge hys dedely synnys, by shryfte and confessyon and do satysfaccion and penaunce / appoynted hym by the preste, as he doth both in dyuers other placys / and also at great length in hys boke de vera & falsa penitentia,

                   where he sayth in thys wyse, Therfore he that repenteth  lette hym vtterly repente / lette hym shewe hys sorow wyth tearys / let hym represente and declare his lyfe vnto god by the preste / lette hym preuent the iudgemēt of god, by shryft. For our lorde commaunded those that were made clene of theyr leprosy, that they shold shewe them self to the prestes / therby teachynge that the synys muste be confessed by bo / +dely presence, and not be shewed by a messenger, nor by writynge. And after in the .xv. chapyter: Lette euery man put hym selfe vtterly in the power of the iudge in the iudgemēt of ye preste / let hym reserue vnto hym selfe no power of hym selfe, but that he be redy at the prestes cōmaundemēt, to do for the repayrynge of the lyfe of hys soule all thynges that euer he wolde do for to fle the deth of hys body, and ye wyth desyre to / for bycause he getteth agayne infynite lyfe.
               
                  And thus it appereth as ye se good reders, in what wyse  saynt Austayne wolde a synner sholde knowledge hys dedely synnys, that is to wytte by shryfte, contrycyon, and satysfaccyon / not onely voluntary bysyde, but also suche as sholde be enioyned by the preste. And whyle frere Barons doth but mocke the sacrament of penaunce / and bycause Cryste is our satysfaccyon, wyll that men shall do none for them selfe: it appereth well I saye therfore that though he speke in thys place as saynt Austayn doth in one place, yet meneth he not as saynt Austayne ment in that place.
               And therfore by frere Barns menynge, a man nedeth no more but knowlege hym self a synner and all is saufe. And then maye the chyrche be sone a greate flocke. For there be folke inough able to make a great flocke, that wylbe co
                     •
                  
                  tent to knowlege theyr synne yf that may serue alone, and  they wythout perell suffred to synne on styll.
               And yet though there were no more requyred but euyn a bare knowlegyng of theyr synne: yet wolde neyther Barons, nor Tindale, nor Luther, nor Lambert, nor Huyskyn do so myche for goddes sake as to knowlege theyr synne / but they wyll rather runne to the deuell in hell, then wynne heuen wyth the bare knowlegynge that theyr poysened he resyes and the abomynable sacryledge of freres & nonnes maryage, is any synne at all.
               And marke well thys by the waye good reader, that by Barons in suche tymes as men haue bytwene the begynnynge of theyr dedely synnes & the knowledgynge of theyr synnys, whyche tymes be in many one manne many tymes in hys dayes: in all those tymes they be not of the chyrch /  and agayne in all the tymes in whyche they knowledge, they be forthwyth of the chyrche. So that by Barns, one selfe manne is of the chyrche & not of the chyrch, not onely many tymes in his lyfe / but also some one is peraduenture of the chyrche and not of the chyrche dyuers tymes in one daye.
               And thys is playne agaynste Tyndals chyrche. For he putteth the chyrche to be a cumpany of onely suche as neuer synne dedely, and therfore be neuer out of the chyrche / how be it he calleth theym all waye repentauntes, and yet sheweth that somtyme they repente not, but be caryed forth in theyr synne long ere they repent / and so neyther agreeth he wyth Barns nor wyth hym selfe neyther.
               
                  
                   But there in doth Baro
                     •
                  s quyte hym as well agayne / for no more doth he neyther. For some tyme he sayth that yt muste nedes be that there muste be suche a chyrche, that by the fayth and the knowlegynge of her synnes, and the herynge of Crystes voyce, and cleuynge to his word / and bycause he hath chosen her, is clensed pure and clene and can not erre. And then agayne he speketh in some place of that fashyon, as though yt myght be that there were some tyme no suche chyrche at all. For he sayth she is clene so longe as she abydeth in hym and no lenger / sygnyfyenge that she myght peraduenture departe oute of hym, & then be no chyrch of his. And therfore he saith yt she can not erre, bycause she hereth the voyce of her sheppard, and bycause she hath the inward oyntemēt of god / as saynt Iohn̄ sayth  that teacheth her all maner of trouthe, so that she can not erre.
               But then to shew vs that we shold not reken our self sure of her doctryne, wenynge that she sholde be at all tymes in suche case and so taughte of god wyth his inwarde oyntement that we might be sure that she wold teche vs nothing but suche as god inwardely taught her: he telleth vs how longe we may truste her, and sayth she is but a woman, and muste be ruled by her husbande / and she is but a shepe, and muste heare the voyce of her

                   And to proue that she may some tyme leue her husband and go from hym, and not be ruled by hym, and so be ful of synne and erroure: he bryngeth in the parable of Chryste, wher

                     •
                   do but yf ye abyde in me. And in this meaneth Barons metely well in part, and better then Tyndale. For by these wordes yt well appereth, that those whyche are good folke in dede, and at one tyme very braunches of that very vine / may by the deuyls meanes and theyr owne folyshe neglygence and frowardnes, fall of fro the vyne and so brynge forth no good frute, but wyther away and serue but for the fyre / as dyd that scysmatike traytoure Iudas, whych was at the tyme of these worde spoken one of the braunches of

that vyne.
               
               And thus meaneth Barns, that he whych is at one tyme good, and of yt may be a nother tyme nought and fall from yt, and then is foule a
                     •
                  d vnclene and full of errours. But in this is Tyndale agaynste Barons. For Tyndale sayth he whyche is ones good and a braunche of that vyne, can neuer synne dedely after / bycause he can not come into it to be a lyuely braunche of that very vyne, but by goddes eleccyon and a felynge fayth, that can as Tindale sayth neuer fayle nor departe out or fall of.
               But therin doth Barons not erre so farre out as Tyndale doth / but taketh yt accordynge to Crystes meanyng, that by this parable geueth euery man warnyng that they may fall of, and byddeth them be ware they do not.
               But then in a nother poynt Barons semeth to rūne out  at rouers as farre beyonde Tyndale. For where as Tyndale falsely telleth vs, that neuer one membre of the chyrch may fall fro Cryste at any tyme: frere Barons telleth vs here, that the whole chyrche may fall from hym dyuerse tymes, and that therfore she may diuerse times erre, and that therfore her doctryne is not alwaye sure, nor maye not alway be lened vnto nor surely be byleued / but y• euery man muste nedes vppon parell of his owne soule examyne and iudge her doctryne, and so receyue or reiecte her doctryne by the worde of god. And this muste euery man do vppon the payne of dampnacyon, whyther he haue wyt and lernynge mete therfore or not.
               And now syth yt is so that Barons putteth in this case not euery syngular member of the chyrche, of whome some  may fall of at one tyme, some at a nother, and som

And bycause we can not well know whē she is with hym and when from hym: therfore he wolde that we shold

                   alway mysse trust her, and euer make an assay and a tryall of her, euery man for hys owne parte vppon the parell of his owne soule, examynynge hym selfe her doctryne by the scrypture, as well man as woman, whether he or she can skyll therof or no. Syth frere Barons I saye telleth vs in effecte this tale contrary to some other partes of his owne tale: I well may and wyll cut of all his bybell babyll that he maketh in tellyng vs that the generall counsayles may erre, bycause yt may be he sayth that they haue not the spyryte of god wyth theym. For what wolde yt auayle for me to denfende the credence of the generall counsayles vnto frere Barōs, when he so handeleth mater that wolde make vs wene that not onely the generall counsayles whyche represent the whole chyrch may erre, but also that the whole  chyrche whiche he putteth hym selfe, of people so clene and pure wythout spot or wryncle, that saynt Peter may fynde no faute in them / though she can not erre whyle she cleueth to god and heareth his word, and therfore therby is suche, yet she may fall fro god he sayth & leue the lenyng vnto his worde, and so wax foule and fylthy, and so fall in errours. I wyll therefore peraduenture at some other conuenyent tyme, entreate the mater of the generall counsayles wyth frere Barons / in whyche treatye I truste to make almoste euery chylde perceyue, that frere Barons all that he babeleth here of the counsayles, yf he hadde asked and foloweed any wyse mannes counsayle, but yf he coulde haue treated yt more wysely, sholde wysely h

               And so doth appere all redy. For he hath not in all y• he  sayth, proued no generall counsayle fallen in any dampnable errour / whyche kynde of errour is the erroure that we speke of.
               But now syth he sayth as ye haue herd, and for as myche also as whether a pope or generall counsayle eyther maye dampnable be deceyued and erre, is not nowe oure mater / but whyther the catholyque knowen chyrche be the very chyrche, and then whether the whole chyrch may erre / and syth the poyntes of the catholyque fayth wherin frere Barons and we vary, and wherin wyllyam Tyndale and we varye, and wherin frere Luther and we vary, and wherin frere Huyskyn and we vary, and wherin we vary wyth all the other hundred sectes of heretyques, and wherin eche of theym varyeth wyth other as well as wyth vs, except only

For where we shold seke her y• he telleth vs not / as though it made no mater though we neuer founde her, so that we know her yf we happe to fynde her. And yet yt appereth y• he thynketh it necessary to seke her and fynde her / for elles wherfore geueth  he any tokens at all.

                  Now must we declare by what signes and tokyns that we may know, that in thys place or that place there be certayne membres of thys wholy chirch. For though she be in her selfe spyrytuall, and can not be perfaytly knowen by our exteriour senses: yet neuertheles we may haue certayn tokens of her spiritual presens, wherby we may rekyn that in thys place and in that place be certayn of her membres. As by a naturall exsample, though the soule of man in her selfe be spirytuall and inuysyble, yet may we haue sure tokens of her presence, as hearing mouynge, spekynge, smellynge, wyth such other. So lyke wyse where the word of god is trewly and perfytely preached, wythout the damnable dremes of men,

                      and where it is well of the 
                        •
                     earers receyued, and also where we se good workes that do openly agre wyth the doctryne of the gospell / these be good and sure tokens wherby that we maye iudge that there be some men of holy chyrche. As to the fyrste, where as the gospell is trewly preached, it muste nedes lyghte in some mennes hartes, as the prophete wytnessyth: My worde shall not returne agayne to me frustrate / but it shall do all thynge that I wyll / and it shall prospere in those thynges vnto whyche I dyd sende it.

The second token is, that the receyuers of this word do worke well  there after, as S. Paule declareth of his hearers, whā you reseued of vs the worde wherwyth god was preached / you reseued yt not as the worde of men, but euyn (as yt was in dede) the worde of god whyche worketh in you that byleue.

More ouer yf Chrysostom complayne of the incontynency that was in hys dayes / how wold he complayne yf he now lyued, and sawe the boudry and fornycacyon that is in the chyrche. Also he sendyth men to scryptures that wyll know the holy chyrch / & not vnto the holy chyrch for in the chyrch were heresyes but not in scripture.
               
               
                  Also saynt Paule wytnessyth the same sayenge / you are bylte vppon the fundacyon of the apostels and prophetes / here haue you playnely that the very trew chyrche is grounded ye and foundyd of holy scrypture / and therfore where so euer that the worde of god is preched / that is a good token that there be some men of  Christes chyrche.

               I lette passe that he noteth in the mergyne these wordes how a man maye knowe the chyrch / and then he telleth vs in hys texte not how a man maye knowe it, nor any pyece  of it / but how a man may know in what place it is / and yet not so myche neyther: For he telleth vs not, go to suche a place, and there thou shalt fynde it, or some membres of it / but he byddeth vs go and telleth vs not whyther / and sendeth vs to seke, & telleth vs not where / but telleth vs onely by what token we shall knowe whyther in the place where we happen to seke, there be any such person or no.
               But now lette vs suppose that he tolde vs the fyrst tale, whyche were yet more to the purpose then the tale that he telleth vs now. And yet bycause he maketh vs hys tale so playne by the sample of the soule / let vs putte hym agayne for our parte some sample of some symple soule / some good merchaunt that were fallen in company wyth frere Barns in the house of hys secret hostes at the sygne of the botell at  Botolfes wharfe, and fyndynge hym walkynge in a mertchauntes gowne wyth a redde Myllayne bonet, and not knowyng that he were ronne out of relygyon / but wenyng that he were an honeste man tolde hym that he were goyng toward Excester / and for as mych as he muste cary money wyth hym, he wolde fayne fynde some good company that were goynge thyther / by whome he myghte be bothe conuayed the ryght waye & also go the more sure: For he hadde herde that there were in many innes many loyterynge felowes, that were false shrewes & yet semed as honeste & as trew as he / whych fals shrewes wold fayne them selfe to be merchaūtes & saye they were goynge thyderwarde to / but when they were gotē in credence & taken into cōpany then vsed to lede men out of y• way & robbe them & kyll them to.
               
                  Now yf frere Barns wold say to thys man ye be happy  that ye haue met wyth me / for I wyll sende you to an inne, where ye shall be sure and neuer fayle to fynde some honest trew merchauntes that are thyderwarde / and than wolde sende hym to a certayne place whyche he wolde name hym. If thys merchaunt whan he had hartely thanked Barns and were goyng very glad of hys chaunce in metyng with thys good man, by whose sendynge he sholde now be sure of good companye in hys iourney, sholde happen yet to remember hym selfe a lytell ferther as soone as he came oute at dore / and theruppon steppe in agayne & saye. But mayster merchaunt I praye you tell me yet one thynge, that I had lyke a fole forgoten before to aske you. In the inn

To thys questyon yf Barns tolde hym there as he telleth vs here, and sayde, yes mary syr that there be, not onely somtyme, but alwaye not a fewe suche loyterynge in the same inne, that lye in awayte to trayne men to them, and after bytraye them and destroye theym / than wolde the man saye mary syr than I praye you tell me how I maye knowe the tone sorte fro the tother. wherunto yf Barns sholde tell hym as he now telleth vs. Nay brother I can tell the no ferther / but thys I  wyll warraunt the, that though there are as alwaye there are in the place that I send the to, many such false theuys / and but very few of those trew men that I tolde the of / yet some such trewe men are there alwaye there / but how thou shalt knowe whych they be, & dyscerne them fro the theuys, that can I not tell the / but that thou mayest as wel be there deceyued in the mysse takynge of them, as thou haste nowe be deceyued in the mysse takynge of me / whome thou takeste for a merchaunt, and yet am I a fr

                   Now the tale that he telleth vs, is yet myche more false and myche more vncertayne. For he telleth not vs so mych as the name of the place, wherin we shall be sure to fynde any of the chyrch / but byddeth vs go take y• scrypture wyth vs and therwith wandre about and aduenture, tyll we happen vppon some place, in whyche we fynde some man tha

                   the scrypture onely / and then where so euer we happen to fynde any man that expowneth it and declareth it trewly wythout any dampnable dremes of men / and where we se that yt ys well of the hearers receyued, & also where we se good workes that do openly agre wyth the doctryne of the gospell,  these be good and sure tokens, wherby that we may iudge that there be some men of holy chyrche there.
               Fyrste wolde I wytte what he meaneth by sure tokens, whether he meane only tokēs & sygnes wherby we may cō
                  iecture that some of the chyrche be there though we knowe not whyche they be as we maye by a sygne of a grene garlande, perceyue that there is wyne in the house though we knowe not where aboute the celler is, or ellys that we may so surely knowe yt, that we can not be deceyued therin / as we be sure by the smoke and the sparcles that there is fyre in the chymeney. If he meane of the fyrste fashyon of sure tokenynge, then is yt no sure sygne and token but an answere, gesse, and coniecture, for there is peraduenture no wyne in that house at all / but the wyne dronken vppe, and  the garland hange styll, and then hadde the wine or the ale by the grene garland or an ale pole haue ben frere Barons a better sample and more mete for his mater, then the sample of the soule knowen to be in the body by the sygnes and tokens of herynge, spekyng, syght, and smellyng, and such thynges as the body can not do but when the soule is in yt And also what am I then the nere yf I may wene there be in that company some of the chyrch, and yet peraduenture there be none, nor myche the nere neyther by Barns chyrch though there be some of theym there in dede as ye shall se sone after.
               Now yf he meane on the seconde maner that by these tokens that we here the worde of god well and truely taught by the preacher, and se yt well receyued of the hearers,

and good gospell workes wrought among people / we may  be very sure that 
                     •
                  here be some of the chyrche in that company, why shold Barons say as he sayth here, that we can not be sure whyche the be: For yf yt may be surely knowen by those tokens, that some of theym be there / then muste of reason those tokens make vs moste sure of those persons, in whome we se them. And yf they can not make vs sure of them, in whom we se them, they can not make vs sure as i
                     •
                   semeth of them in whome we se theym not.
               For when oure sauyour sayde of hypocryte heretyques ye shall know them by theyr frutes,
                     Matth. 7.
                   he ment that ye sholde perceyue the same persons for heretyques and hypocrytes by the euyll fruts of theyr false doctrine, that vnder a cloke of vertuouse lyuynge and clennesse they shold secretly sow and set forth false heresyes contrary to the knowē doctryne  that hym selfe hadde taught his catholyke chyrch, and that they sholde also be perceyued by the frute of euyll workes, wyth whych he wold,
                     Matth. 7.
                   yf men toke hede & wached them well (as he bode them do) cause them to be deprehended and taken, and theyr maske
                     •
                  s taken of and theyr hypocrisye to be discouered. But Cryste ment not that the tokens founde in one person shold leue vs vnsure of hym, and only make vs sure that some herytyque and hypocryte were there, as Barons here sayth by his tokēs we shall be sure that some of the chyrche be there, but I can not be sure whyche person is any of them.
               Now yf he sayde this onely in whole great regyons his reason myghte haue som place, for of a great multytude semynge  good men, I maye well reken that though some be hypocrytes, all be not so. But whyle Barons sayth where so euer I fynde these tokens, there I maye be sure y• some of his chyrch wythout spot or wryncle are amonge theym, the place may be so smale, and the companye so few that I cou
                     •
                  d not be sure, but myght well fere ye though I se suche good tokens in some of theym, yet of that clene and pure chyrch of frere Barons there were neuer one among them.
               yet aske I frere Barons farther, howe proueth he that where so euer we fynde these tokens, we shall be sure that though we can not tell whyche they be, yet sure we may be that of his holy chyrche some in that company there be.
               In the answere vnto this, he putteth a dyfferēce in dede betwene the token of the good workes, and the tokē of the

                   trew preachynge. For as for the workes though they be very trew gospell workes, they be he sayth no perfyte sure sygnes but onely tokens wherby we may coniecture & deme well but not be sure, bycause they may be fayned by hypocrysye / but the tother token of the preachynge, that token is he sayeth a perfyte token, so that in that companye where so euer we se that happen, we haue a perfayt token that there be in that company some men of Chrystes holy chyrche.
               And this he proueth as ye haue herd by the authoryte of the prophete Esaie and of saynte Poule, and by the sample of saynte Peter in the tenth of the Actes, where at the preachynge of saynte Peter the holy goost fell downe on them all.

               what do the wordes proue for Barons purpose? If he proue vs his purpose by these wordes, he muste proue vs  fyrst that the word of god, wherof the prophete Esaie there speketh,

                   is none other worde but onely the preachynge of the scrypture. For that is the worde whyche frere Barons here speketh of. And therfore in the prophet Esaie the word may sygnyfye that worde of god, of whyche worde saynte Iohn̄ 
                  
                     •
                  ayth, In the begynnynge was the worde, that is to wyt the onely begoten son of god, as yt there sygnyfyeth in dede, & not the word wryten in scrypture, though y• of that word be mych wrytē in scrypture. Then se
                     •
                  th euery lerned man that those wordes of Esaie nothynge proue the purpose of frere Barons, though yt myght there sygnyfye also the worde wryten in scrypture. For yt proueth ye wote wyll not for the preachynge of the worde of god wryten in s
                     •
                  rypture, yf yt be doutefull and not euydent, whyther the prophete spake of the scrypture or not.
               
                  But now who so euer loke vppon the place in the byble  he shall se that lyre, and the ordynary glose, and the interlynyare glose also, do declare that though the wordes maye be expowned of the scrypture: the prophete speketh these wordes properly of the worde of god, that is goddes onely bygoten sone. And the very texte playnely sheweth vppon all the cyrcumstaūces, that the prophete there prophecyeth in the persone of the father after this maner. As though he wolde say, My worde, that is to wyt my son whom I haue sent into the worlde for the redempcyon of man, shall not retourne agayne to me voyde or empty. For he shall bryng wyth hym the fathers oute of Lymbus. But he shall do all thynge that I wyll. For he shall teache both by wordes ensample and myracles, both the Iewes and the Paynyms, and make one chyrche of both, and shall in fulfyllynge of  my wyll, humble hym selfe vnto the deth, euen the deth of the crosse. And he shall prosper in those thynges vnto the whyche I sent hym. For hym self shall gloryousely ryse agayne fro deth, and ascende vppe to me, and here sytte in eternall glory on my ryght hande, one egall god wyth the holy goste and me, and shall bryng hyther also a gloryouse chyrche out of erthe, to reygne wyth vs here in heuen.
               Of this word therfore spake the prophete, that is to say of the sonne of god, and of his retournynge agayne to hys father / of whose goynge forthe fro the father and retournynge agayne to the father,
                     Psal. 18.
                   wryteth the prophete Dauid: His goyng forth is from the hygh heuen, and his meatyng is vnto the height thereof / and is not properly ment by the  preachynge of the worde wryten in scrypture. And therfore as I tolde you yt nothynge proueth the purpose of frere Barons.
               And yet ouer all this, yf the prophete spake there of the worde wryten in scrypture, and of none other: yet wolde it not proue that in euery place where yt were preached, yt sholde nedes take suche holde / in some folke, that yt sholde of necessyte make in euery suche place some very members of the chyrch pure and clene wythoute spot or wrincle. For god hath none other wyll for any thynge by Barns proued yet, yt his word shold take such holde in euery place then in euery mā / but lyke as his word doth his wyll & retourned not agayne to god voyd, yf yt take hold in some men tha

                   heare yt, though yt take not hold in euery man that hereth

                   yt / so doth yt his wyll and retourneth not to hym voyde, yf yt take holde in some place where yt is preached, though yt take not holde in euery place.
               And that it shold not in euery place take hold / appereth by the wordes of our sauyour, where he sayth to hys dyscyples whom he sent to preche, In to what house so euerye entre, fyrste saye ye peace be to thys house.
                     Luce. 10.
                   And then yf the sonne of peace be there / your peace shall reste vppon hym, or ellys your peace shall retourne agayne vnto your selfe. In whyche oure sauyour sheweth vs, that yf a good man preche well, though there were not one in all hys audyence that wold be ye better for it / yet sholde it not be voyde / for the meryte sholde at the leste rebounde backe vppon hym selfe, but not of necessyte take holde in euery audyence, so farre  forth that it myghte be preched vnto an hole cyty, and take none holde but be reiected. For whyche cause our sauyour sayed also to those whome he sent to preche:

               And thus good readers ye se that these wordes of ye prophete Esaye wyll in no wyse auayle frere Barns / but vtterly they leue hys purpose all vnproued.
               Now hath he than but one ancre more vnto that shippe & that is the wordes of saynt Poule, where he sayth, Fayth cometh by herynge, & herynge cometh by the worde of god.  But surely thys ancre lyeth to farre aloufe fro thys shyppe and hath neuer a cable to fasten her to it. For neuer herd I yet two thynges so losely knyt to gyther.
               what maner an argument doth frere Barons call thys? Fayth cometh by herynge, and heryng cometh by the word of god / ergo in euery place where the worde of god is herd, must nedes be some faythfull men.
               Though there were neuer man faythfull wythout herynge of the worde of god, as in dede there is not ordynaryly in actuall fayth / maye it not be for all that that there maye be many that here it to gyther in one place, of all whome neuer one wyll be faythfull, but haue the fayth in derysyon. Thys argument is so folysshe that I meruayle frere Barons wolde be so fonde to brynge it forth.
               
                  And thus good chrysten reades here ye se now to what  poynt frere Barons is brought, with his sygnes & tokens, wherwyth he promysed vs to make vs knowe where were some membres of hys holy pure clene chyrch, wherin he cō
                  fesseth hym selfe that some of his sygnes and tokens be but faynt and vnsuffycyent. And than that one whyche he sayth is perfayth, ye se so vnperfytely proued, that of all the scripturs that he bryngeth, there is not one syllable serueth him
               And yet haue I shewed you also, that yf he proued all yt he sayth / yet were all hys techyng of knowlege where some of the chyrch be, wythout the knowlege who they be, a very frutelesse knowlege, wherof the knower coulde neuer take spyrytuall profyte.
               But now good chrysten readers, to the entent that the foly of frere Barons inuēcyon may the more clerely appere  concernyng his tokens with whiche he techeth vs to know his vnknowē chyrch / let vs yet a lytell consyder hys lesson better. Let vs suppose that some good honest merchaū
                  tes wyfe, a woman honest of her conuersacyon, beynge by some shrewed gosseppes of hers brought in aquayntaunce wyth some false wyly heretike, had bygonne to fall in some dowte and fere, leste the fayth that she had before lerned of the thyrche, concernyng the seuen sacramentes, & prayeng to sayntes, and prayeng for soules, and many thynges mo, were vntrew and daungerouse to lyue and dye in / and that she were not yet so farre fallen to the wronge syde, but that she stode styll in a dowte and in a mamerynge whyche way she myghte take, and fayne wold take the beste. And beyng thus brought into thys doute, had by some proctour of the  euangelycall fraternyte, secretely broughte vnto her frere Barons boke. After whych secretely redde ouer by her self in a corner, for many thynges that she partely lyked, partely mysse lyked in the redynge, perceyuynge that he was than vppon hys passage ouer these agayne, longed sore to speke wyth hym selfe ere he wente / and theruppon beynge by some good brother and syster broughte to gyther where there were none present but suche as were towarde the fraternyte, after solempne salutacyons and gostely gretynges of the congregacyon in osculo charitatis, she wolde breke her mynde vnto hym, & shew hym that by the good gracyouse mocyone of such a man or suche a woman, she had bygonne to entre in to the consyderacyon of her soule helthe / 

                   and not to be so neglygent as she had before ben, to byleue euery prestes tale that standeth vp in a pulpet, but to seke some sure way how she may surely

                  gregacyon,  wherof euery one longed to be comforted with his gostely cōmunycacyon at that tyme specyally, whyche was as it semed the laste in whyche they were lykely to be fedde wyth the plesaūt cōuersacyon of his bodyly presence. And therfore she wold no more desyre of hym for the tyme, but that he wold as our sauyour when hym self wente hys way, dyd sende his holy spyryt to teche his apostles, & hys apostles to teche the wyde wyld ignoraūt world / so maye it please you good father Barns whyle ye depart hense, to assygne some meane & shew me some way, by whych I maye be sure all way to haue some good gracious spyrituall mā, some trew mēber of the very chirch, of whom I may be sure to lerne the very trew fayth, that our sauyour fyrste by hym selfe, & after by his holy spyryt taught his blessed apostles,  & by them the world that wold lerne / & yet by ye same spyryt techeth his very holy chyrch styll, as ye shew to my symple myndefull well & clerkely in your goodly processe, wherin ye declare whych is the very chyrch. I beseche you therfore do no more for me for thys onys, but leste I be when ye be gone deceyued by some false techer, set me now before your goynge in some way, wherby I may be sure euer of a trew.

And yet wolde he for hys parte to theyr ferther consolacyon, make and sende them ouer some new bokes of the euangelycall doctryne in theyr mother tonge, for the better edyfyenge of theyr sely symple soules. And thys wolde he saye for the comforte of the hole fraternyte and sororyte in generall. And then for answere to ye good syster in specyall, he wold peraduenture

                   aduyse her to take the new testament of Tyndales translacyon, and other bokes of his, and of his owne, and of George Iouy / and therin sholde she fynde the trouth. wherunto yf she sayde that she might not for fere of her husbandes losse and her own parell, aduenture to kepe these bokes bycause of the kynges proclamacyon / he wolde tell her and persuade her playnely, that the bokes of the scrypture she must nedes kepe spyght of all the prynces proclamacion to dye therfore. (For that he wryteth playnely all redy, but as for ye tother bokes, he layeth not expressely so sore a charge vppon them) wherfore he wold enioyne her at the lest wise to kepe the scrypture in englysh, and tell her that therin she sholde lerne all trouh.
               But then is yt lykely that she myght say, that the scrypture  is hard for her to vnderstād / & therfore shew him yt the thyng whyche she desyreth of hym, is to know of hym (syth hym self goth away) how she myght be sure to haue a good trew teacher, that myght in euery necessarye poynte of bylyefe, expowne the scrypture and teache yt her trewly.
               Then wolde he peraduenture assygne her some specyall spedde man in the sectes, and tell her she may lerne of hym. But then were she lykely to say that he myght happely be dreuen awaye for fere of persecucyon / ye or peraduenture dye byfore she shold be fully lerned and instructed in the necessarye trouthes by the scrypture: whyche she coulde not thynke her selfe to be, tyll she dyd in euery suche trouth vnderstande all the places of scryptures that eyther made for  yt or semed to saye agaynste. And therfore wolde she fayne know nowe of hym, by what meane she myghte alwaye be sure of a trew teacher.
               Then wolde he peraduenture tell her, that who so euer preache truely the worde of god, accordynge to that scrypture

                   she myght be sure that he were a trew preacher, and of hym she myght surely lerne.
               But vnto that she were lykely to say: Father Barons, This same scrypture is very hard / and in the moste necessary poyntes dyuerse preachers expowne yt diuersly, some for the sacramentes, & some agaynste theym, some for the vowe of chastyte and some agaynste yt, some for good workes, and some for fayth alone, some for purgatorye & some agaynste yt, and so in suche other thynges / so that excepte I may be sure of the trew teacher, vnto whose credence I

may truste in the construccyon, I shall alway remayn styll  in lyke doute, and not vnderstande the scrypture. And therfore shall I not be able by the scrypture to trye the trew prechour, but must by ye knowledge of the trew preachour trye whyche is the vnderstandynge of the scrypture. And therfore I wolde haue the trew preachour to teache me truely to vnderstande the same scrypture. And for that intente wold I know hym, to thend that I myght by that I know hym for a trew preacher, be sure that by his teachyng I do not damnably mysse vnderstand the scrypture, but am truely taught yt. And now you tell me that who so teche the scripture trewly is a teacher. And then muste I by this tale of yours, brynge wyth me to hym or ellys I can not knowe hym, the thyng yt I can not gete but yf I know hym fyrst.

And therfore shold I not haue so great occcasion to byleue and to take for the trewe teacher any one man that wolde constre me the scrypture nowe, namely constrewynge yt in  such wyse many of his owne felowes, professyng the fayth of Cryste as he doth, wyll say that he constreweth yt false / whyche happed not in the construccyons that saynte Phylyppe made Enuchus.
               And therfore though our sauyour say, that such as are his do heare his voyce, and not the voyce of straungers: he semeth to meane there in to geue vs warnynge do so, that is to wyt, that we shold heare and obay hym, and not other agaynste hym. For who so wyll heare heretyques and not hym, be none of his.
               And that the vnccyon and inwarde inspyracion of god, techeth vs and maketh vs perceyue that is very trew. For god inwardly worketh with the will of man walkyng with god, in well vsynge and applyenge conuenyent occasyons

towarde yt outwardely geuen by god. But yt meaneth not  that by and by vppon euery thynge that we heare, we shold wythout consyderacyon geue our selfe to the consent of the tone syde or the toth

                   For god byddeth vs that we shold not be lyght of bylyefe, nor by and by byleue euery spyryte / but proue the spyrytes whether they be of god. And then yf we be not only symple as douys,

                   and inwardely be rauenouse wolues.
               To this wold frere Barns say. For soth dere doughter in the lorde, those wolues be these monkes, and freres, and prestes that be the comen preachers of this carnall chyrch, that they falsely call the catholyque chyrch, whych do tech

                   bysyde the scrypture dampuable dremes of men, and make men byleue that dome sacramentes, and ceremonyes, and good workes, sholde do good to the soule: whych false prechers wyth all theyr carnall chyrch that hath now ben this viii. hundred yere ledde out of the ryght way, we new preachers of the very trew chyrche whych is spyrytuall, do now by the worde of god wryten in holy scrypture conuycte and reproue.
               
               To this were she well lykely to say agayne / veryly father Barns here ye bryng me now euen to the very poynt. For syth that the apostles of Cryste begonne that lerned of his owne mouth, & no one man lefte now nor neuer synnes theyr tyme, whome men myght so surely take for an vndouted teacher as them: yt semeth that god hath lefte the sure credēce of doctryne in no one man, but in his whole chyrch. And therfore that man whych agreeth in doctryne with the very chyrche, I maye reken sure that his doctryne is very trew in the necessary exposycyon of scrypture / not for hys owne authoryte of suerty of his person, nor for the suertye that I can haue that his doctryne agreeth well wyth scrypture / for I can not know that but by that I know hym for

                   for a trew techer: but for y• surty that I haue that the doctryne of the hole catholyke very trew chyrch, wyth whiche hys techyng agreeth, can not be false. For yf it myght, then were there no sure trewe chyrch at all / & that must there nedes be as all sortes of sectes agre as I here saye. And therfore this trew chyrche beyng knowen, yf you shew me how I may get a techer whose techyng agreeth wyth that / then dare I byleue hym well / & els it wyll be harde for any suche as I am, to thynke with reason that she sholde gyue sure credence to any man, or that she can be by the scripture sure of so many sectes of contrary consterers, which one constreweth trewly when all the tother say nay and be all redy to swere that he constreweth false. And therfore good father Barns wyll she say I, lyke it well that ye declare so well at  length which is the very chyrch, bycause we shold not be deceyued with the false prophetes of the fals chyrch, of whom Cryst bode vs take hede & beware. For the very trew chyrche onys knowē / we shall as our sauyour sayth yf we take good hede,

               And therfore good father Barns I wolde haue wyshed that ye had taken a lytell more payne in declaryng and makyng open by what meanes the very trew holy chyrch whiche  ye do assygne, myghte be perceyued and knowen / to the entent that by the knowlege of her & of her prechers whych must nedes haue credence and be knowen for trew techers, bycause they be membres of her that is trew, and theyr doctryne agr

                   all other chyrches. For I am sure good father Barons, y• whan ye went about to gyue vs tokens wherby we myght haue some knowledge of this chyrche, ye perceyued well that of necessyte it is a thyng y• nede were to be knowē for the good that maye folow yf it be knowen, & the harme that wolde ensew yf it remayned vnknowen. For ellys ye wolde haue taken no labour about it, to seke vs out suche tokens by whyche we myghte haue knowledge of it.
               And surely me thynketh that the chyefe commodyte

that I can haue of the knowledge of it is thys, that I may  when I knowe her, be lerned and instructed by her, & be surely nuryshed by her in the spyrytuall fode. For holy chyrch is our mother, as ye call her your self / and therfore is it she whych engēdreth vs to god, & which both with mylke and strenger mete, must fede vs & foster vs vp / & none other nuryce is therby whom we can be truely & faythfully brought vp. And therfore yf we myghte not knowe her / we were in daynger eyther to be hūger storuen, or ellys in stede of holsome fode to be fed wyth poysen.
               But now peraduenture frere Barons wold answere to thys, that it maketh no mater thoughe we knowe not her. It is 
                     •
                  nough that she knowe vs, & come & geue vs good & faythfull fode, and preche truely to vs, though we knowe not that it is she. But vnto this the woman wold I wene  neuer stycke for an answere, but wolde s

               But now be we (wolde she saye) suche as be thus farre well warned, y• not onely our mother holy chyrch is onely she that can & wyll fede vs well, & wyll gladly offer to geue vs good holsom fode / but that also there be a great mayny of other wycked women whyche go about to poysen vs / & whych bycause they know that we be well aduertysed that they so entend, & that onely our mother wyll fede vs well, ech of them laboreth by all the meanys that theyr wyly malyce can deuyse, to make vs mysse take our mother, & ech of them calleth her selfe our mother, and laboreth to be byleued  / & out of one selfe good ground of holy scrypture, both our very mother bryngeth & offreth vs holsome frute, and these false fayned mothers out of the selfe same grounde of scrypture, by theyr false handelynge b

               But now yf we maye onys knowe whyche of all these is our very mother, then are we saufe and sure. For thanne are we sure that as all the remanaūt wyl gyue vs no meate but nought / so wyll she gyue vs none but good. and therfore who so loue hys lyfe, wyll take all that she offreth vs / all though it be bytter and soure in taste and not very semely

                   in syghte / and refuse all that the tother offer vs, be it neuer so pleasaunt to the eye, nor neuer so delycyous to the mouthe.
               And I verely thynke that the thynge standynge in such case, our father in heuyn so myghty, so mercyfull, and so wyse as he is, and so tenderly louynge hys chyldren as he doth, perceyuynge the perell that myghte and muste nedys falle vppon them by the mysse takynge of some suche false malycyouse woman in stede of our very mother, wyll not leue vs in suche case, but that he wyll cause oure very mother to be well knowen frome all the false counterfetes, to suche as lyste to loke and attende well therto, bothe by tokens of her and also tokens of them.
               And veryly good father Barons, it semeth that ye sawe thys your selfe full well. For it appereth vppon your wordes,  that there is no trew prechour but there as is the very chyrche. For ye shew for a perfayt token of the trew chyrch, that there as is the trewe prechynge, there be alwaye some of the trew chyrch. And ye wryte that thys token is perfayt. Now than / yf where so euer is trewe preachynge, there is alwaye some of the very chyrche / it muste nedes folowe to my pore wytte that am but a woman, that where so euer be none of the very chyrche, there is no tr

                  e of her the ryght vnderstandynge of the scrypture, bycause she is our very mother as your selfe calleth her. And therfore we haue the nede to knowe her, that we may be bolde to take the fode of doctryne at her hande, bycause we wote wel our very moder wyl gyue vs but good / where we stande ellys in perell of poysenynge, yf by mysse takyng our mother we take the meate of doctryne at the hande of any of those venemouse harlottes, that conterfete ther contenaunce and wolde we sholde take one of theym for oure mother.
               And also though the tokens bothe twayne were sure &  perfayt for so farre as they go, that is to wytte though that I were sure in dede that in suche a company be some of the very trewe chyrche: yet syth I can not knowe by them whiche persons of that company they be as ye confesse I can not / what sholde thys knowledge auayle me? It may peraduenture hynder and hurte me. For yf I dowted lest there were happely no suche trewe membres of the very chyrche in that company / I wolde be the more ware of any thynge that they sholde teche me. But now whyle though I know not who, yet I wene my self that I know well some of them be trewe / I maye percase the more boldely and wyth y• lesse fere, take that the false shall offer me for the hope I maye haue, that I haue peraduenture by happe fortuned vppon that person that is one of the trewe. For why, to vse dylygence

                   and forbere haste, and be ware and byleue not tyll I surely fynde and know the trew / that were by your wordes vtterly vayne. For ye say I shall neuer know them, nor neuer know farther, but that there be some of them.
               Now good readers what hath Barons holdyng his heresy of his vnknowen chyrche, what hath he to say more to this woman? In good fayth nothyng that wyll be worth a flye. But the womā may sone fynd more yet to say to hym. For she may saye to hym ferther: yet I remember me now father Batons a nother thyng. ye wyll that I shall know y• chyrch by the trew declaracyon of scripture. But how shall I be sure whyche be the very bokes of scrypture? For you say playnely that the pystle of saynt Iames is not holy scrypture, and other men say yes. And ye say that ye can proue  that pystle false by wordes of saynt Poule / and 
                     •

                  re ye lykele to make me to doute as well of saynt Poule as of saynt Iames. For why shold I better byleue the tone then the tother, whyle they were both Crystes approued apostles. For though ye saye that yt was of old douted by some folke whyther that pystle were wryten of saynte Iames or not: yet after that doute moued, the whole chyrche hath fermely byleued yt to be his, without any doute of any man in a thousande yere to gether, tyll wythin this .xx. yere.
               And then as ye say now by that peyce, so may there a nother come and saye by a nother peyce / and so go aboute

               To this when frere Barons wolde answere and falsely bere her in hande that the pystle of saynte Iames hath ben a
                     •
                  way douted of. And that such bokes as haue ben alway by the whole chyrch taken and accepted for holy scrypture, of those may she be sure that they be holy scrypture / for god geueth his chyrche that gyfte, that yt can trewely dyscerne the wordes of god from the wordes of man: this wyll I wote well frere Barons saye. For this sayth not onely hys olde mayster saynte Austayne, oute of whose rule and relygyon frere Barons is ronne away / but his new mayster also

frere Luther, after whom he rūneth out of relygyon and  out of rule now.
               But when Barns wolde answere her so: then wold she sone brynge hym to the bay, and tell hym that the chyrche by whyche she knoweth whych is the scrypture, is not any vnknowen chyrch / but the knowen catholyque chyrche of all crysten nacyons remaynyng in the comen well knowen fayth.
               And then syth she may boldely byleue that chyrch in y• gret point, and lerneth that lessen of none other chyrch but that, whyche is the fyrste lesson of all the fayth, and wheruppon as frere Barons agreeth all the whole remanaunt dependeth, syth that by hym there is nothynge any sure trewth but yf yt be wryten in scrypture: she maye therfore wolde she saye take that chyrche for the teacher of all the remanaūt  / and hym for a trew techer, whose fayth agreeth wyth that chyrche / and those folke whose fayth is cōtrary to that chyrche, whych shall sone be knowen, for they be forthwith accused and reproued vppon theyr false preachinges herd, them she may and wyll take for the false teachers and false expowners of scrypture, tyll father Barons can geue her better knoweledge of his holy trewe chyrche vnknowen, wherof she is neuer the nere yet:
               Lo thus myght a wyse woman that coulde no more but rede englyshe, rebuke and confounde frere Barons vppon the syght of his owne ryall processe, in whych he wold now teache vs to know whyche is the very chyrche.
               How be yt to confounde hym, we shall not greatly nede to seke one that can rede. For what hath he to say to a pore  woman that coulde not rede?
               If his owne secrete hostesse the good wyfe of the botell of Botolphs warfe, that but yf she be better amended halteth both in body and soule, were in the congregacyon present at this cōmenyng / and then wold hympe forth among them and say, by saynt Malkyn father Barons all your tokens of the very trew chyrch wyll not stand m

                   in the stede of a tauern token nor of a mustarde token neyther. For I may for the tone be sure of a new bakē bune, and for the tother I maye be sure of a pot of mustarde / but for your two tokens of youre holy chyrche, I can not be sure of one ferthyng worth of trew doctrine for them both. For how shall I perceyue that any trew members of your holy chyrche in

                   onely whom ye say is the trew fayth be present in cōpany, when your tokēs be the trew prechyng of scripture, and the good leuyng after the scrypture / how can I gete any good by those two tokēs when I can not rede at all: what could frere Barons say to his hostesse here? Surely nothynge hath he / but sholde in the ende be fayne to fall to the desteny of goddes eleccyon, and say as he sygnyfyeth and somwhat mutereth in his boke / but then sholde he be fayne to speke yt out and say, that when they come to the prechyng, all those that are electe of god shall be secretely moued and taught inwardely, and shall by the instyncte of the spyryt of god though they know not whether the person be good or no that preacheth, perceyue yet the trewe worde of god vppon the herynge / and shall vnderstande yt as Tyndale  sayth that the egle perceyued her pray.

But he which knoweth the wyll of hys lorde and than do it not, shalbe sore beten. And when I herde thys preched, me thoughte it went sore agaynst the doctryne of our brother Tyndale, that sayeth as our owne bretherne reporte in hys answere to syr Thomas More / that whan the wytte perceyueth a thynge, the wyll can not chose but folowe. For that is playne false, yf ye 
                   scrypture be trew that saith that a man may know the wyll of hys lorde and yet leue it vndone.
               And me semeth also yt the same scrypture maketh mych agaynst our brother Tyndale and our brother Fryth, and agaynst the prechynge of all our euangelycall bretherne cō

               Nor it wyll not helpe that I herde onys one of our bretherne answere and saye, that whan he repenteth than he doth the wyll of hys lorde / and therfore shall not be beten at all.

               But surely father Barns as I tolde you, me thynketh that these comon prechers say well in that poynt
                     •
                   that they saye that god hath prouyded suretye of doctryne, that is to saye of trew prechynge the worde of god / and makynge it to be so vnderstanden, as men may be sure that they may voide all dampnable errour yf they wyll, or ellys they were not to be blamed for fallynge in therto.
               And they that tell vs that we shalbe dampned but yf we byleue ryght, and than tell vs that we can not knowe that but by the scrypture, and than the scrypture can not be so lerned but of a trew techer, and they tell vs we can not be

sure of a trew techer, and so can not be sure to vnderstand

                   it ryght / and yet saye that god wyll dampne vs for vnderstandynge it wrong or not vnderstandyng at all: they that thus tell vs, put me in mynde of a tale that they tell of M. Henry Patenson, a man of knowen wysdome in London and almost euery where ellys, which when he wayted onys on hys mayster in the emperours courte at Brugges, and was there sone perceyued vppon the syghte for a man of specyall wytte by hym selfe and vnlyke the comon sorte / they caught a sporte in angryng of hym / and out of dyuers corners hurled at hym suche thynges as angred hym, and hurte hym not. Theruppon he gathered vp good stonys / not gunstonys, but as harde as they / and those he putte a pace into hys bosome, and then stode hym vp vpon a bench and made a proclamacyon alowde that euery man myghte  here hym / in whyche he commaunded euery man vppon theyr owne parellys, to departe except onely those that horled at hym, to thentent that he myghte knowe theym and horle at them agayne and hurte none other body but hys enemyes. For who so euer taryed after hys proclamacyon made / he wolde take hym for one of the horlers or ellys for one of theyr consaylers / and than haue at theyr hedes who so euer they were that wolde abyde. Now was hys proclamacyon in englysshe and the company that herd hym were suche as vnderstode none / but stode styll and gaped vppon hym and lawghed at hym. And by & by one horled at hym agayne. And anone as he saw that / what horsons quod he ye stande styll euerychone I wene, and not one of you wyll remoue a fote for all my proclamacyō / and therby I se well  ye be horlers or of counsayle with the horlers all the whole maynye of you / and therfore haue at you all agayne. And wyth the worde he hurled a great stone oute at aduenture amonge them / he neyther wyste nor rought at whome / but lyghted vppon a burgonyons hed and brake hys pate that the bloude ranne about hys earys, and mayster Henry bad hym stande to hys harmys hardely / for why wolde he not beware than and gete hym thense bytyme, whan he gaue hym before so fayre courteyse warnynge.
               Now good father Barns wolde his haltynge hostesse saye, ye seme 
                     •
                  ow by your tale to make as though god almyghty wold vse of a straunge affeccyon the same fashyon that M. Henry vsed of foly / that is to wyt to make vs a proclamacyon

                   in suche wyse endyghted, as we can not vnderstande it wythout we maye be sure of a trew interpretour / and than gyue some of vs suche as hym lysteth, a secrete priuy knowlege of such one / and all the remanaūt yt fayne wolde and can not fynde out and know the trew expouner of his proclamaciō, for lacke of that token which he kepeth from them, horle stonys at theyr hedes bycause the fulfyll it not.

                  sō yt ye tech vs herin is a very perilouse plasphemy.
               And yet abyde I remember me lo father Barns vppon an other thynge wolde she say, that yf ye brynge all to this poynt in conclusyon, that there is no more but euery man go where he wyll, and here whom he lyste / & alwaye he that is electe shall by the inwarde inspyracion happen vpon the  trewe precher, and the trew prechyng, and the trew knowledge of the very worde of god, and the trewe vnderstandyng therof, and onely therby gete heuyn / and all the remanaunt for the onely lacke of goddys eleccyon to the getyng wherof them selfe ye saye can nothyng do, shall fayle of all these thynges and fall in contynuall errour, out of whyche they can haue no mene possyble to escape, but therby muste nedes fall into eternall fyre: yf it thus be, ye maye put vp agayn both your tokens into your purse, for any nede that any man hath of them. For they that be sure by the secrete in
                     •
                  pyracyon, that they be truely taught, and therby knowe them self for electes, and so be sure they shalbe saued: what nede they to care whyther any of the very chyrch be in that  congregacyon or not: and on the tother syde, those whose desteny shalbe for lacke of eleccyō to be dampned, and therfore shall not lerne the trouth in the congregacyō be there neuer so many of the very chyrche therin / they lo, to knowe whyther there be any therin or no, can stande theym in no stede at all. And thus father Barns takyng your secrete vnknowen spyrytuall chyrche / ye myghte spare all the labour that ye haue hytherto taken in gyuyng vs tokens to know it by, for any stede that your tokens can stande vs in. And therfore yf euer any chyrche here in erthe shall stande vs in any stede towarde any suretye of trew doctryne, as in dede it must yf any man may tell an other how he may be surely caught the trouth: it must nedes be in any wyse some such chyrch as nedes must be knowen for such that a man may be sure to lerne therof.
               
                  what wold frere Barns haue answered vnto his hostesse, yf she had tolde hym this / and that he than hadde sene the tother good wyfe her neyghbour begyn to gape agayn, as she that were yet redy to brynge in some other fawte yet founden ferther in hys tale, as there myghte in good fayth me semeth many be founden, not onely by lerned men but euyn by vnlerned women to, suche fawtes as neyther frere Barons nor all the lerned heretykes of all theyr hundred sectys sholde be well able to voyde / so stronge a thynge is trouth, and so feble a thynge is falsshed, and so hard to be borne out and defended.
               But than wold frere Barns haue waxed a lytell warme, and byd them syt styll and holde theyr bable, and tell them that saynt Poule wyst full well what he dyd whan he wold not suffer women to take vppon theym to preche and teche  in the chyrche, nor so mych as aske a questyon amonge the congregacyon / but yf they dowted of any thynge that they wolde lerne, lette them aske it of theyr owne husbandes at home. And so wolde frere Barns byd those wyues do wyth sorow. For yf they myghte be suffered to begyn onys in the congregacyon to fall in dysputynge, those aspen leuys of theyrs wolde neuer leue waggynge.
               But thenne wolde the wyfe of the botell haue answered hym agayne quyckely, and tell hy

                   that she had alwaye taken hym for wyser, and wolde haue went he coulde haue taught better.

How be it synne I se now that you father Barns that were onys a doctour can saye no better for it / by our lady I bygyn so to mystrust all the mater, that

And I se also that all you were ones wyth her, and be fallen at varyaunce wyth her, and so be comen from her for angre. And  I se that though she be not so good as I wold she were / yet for angre and enuy synnes ye be come from her, ye my

                  se reporte her in many thynges, & wold make her appere myche worse. And I se also that suche vyces as are well kowen for vyce, whyche ye fynde and rebuke in her, be

                  yfe & well knowen in you selfes. And I se also that many suche holy men haue ben brought vppe wyth her, as your self confesse for sayntes / and amonge all your chyrches I neuer herde of any one. And I se also ye some thyng ye teche amōg you, all most euery one, such as all those holy saintes abhorted & had in abominacyon / as for ensample the weddyng of freres & nūnes. And I se also yt in our chyrch as bad as we be, yet god contynueth his myracles / and amonge all your chyrches that be gone from oures, he worketh neuer one.

And I se also that eche of your chyrches wold fayne seme  to be the trewe chyrches / for eche of youres affermeth that onely it selfe hath the trouth, and the trew chyrch is yt whiche onely chyrche hath the trouthe. And then agayne eche of you seeth his owne parte so feble and so farre vnable to be defended in that poynt, that syth no one chyrch of all yours may be matche to our chyrche out of which ye all came, and then that eche chyrche of yours or all your chyrches to geder beynge eche to other so contraryouse and repugnaunt, shold be the trew chirch, were ye wote well your selfe a thynge more then impossyble: ye be fayne for thys cause to sende vs to an vnknowen chyrche. By whych sendynge, whyle ye wolde wythdrawe me from ours / yet ye cō
                  fesse the contrary of all that ye go about. For ye wold seme eche of you to haue the very trouth / and then were you the  trew chyrthe and the sure teachers. But nowe syth ye saye the trew chyrche is vnknowen, and eche of your chyrches is knowen / it appereth by your own tale yt none of all your chyrches is the trew chyrch. And yf it be not the trew chyrch then hath yt not the trew doctryne whych yt pretēdeth / but is one of ye false chyrches & hath ye false doctryne. And therfore yf yt so were in dede, that our chyrch were not the trew chyrche, nor were not my ryghte mother in dede / but that the very chyrche and my very mother were onely some one suche as ye wolde sende me to seke, that is to say some vnknowen chyrche: yet father Barons by your owne tale yt were none of all your chyrches. And therfore I were but a fole to leue the knowen catholyque chyrche, whom I haue hytherto taken for my very mother, and come from her to  yours, whych as your selfe cōfesseth is not the trew chyrch, and therfore not my very mother / but that my very mother were one whome ye neyther tell me where I may fynd her, sauynge that ye byd me go seke her / and ye say she is some where abrode in the wylde worlde, whych world is a place to wyde ye wote well for a woman to ouer walke well (and at that worde wolde hympe halt his hostes hoppe forth agayne, and say mary syr that yt were in dede for me) and also yf I wolde wander all aboute to loke her, yet yf I happed to come in her company, ye tell me no sure marke wherby I might well know her, but onely that I shold perceyue her to be there / but I sholde not yet wyt whyche were she, and then were she for me / almoste as good by thense. And

                   therfore father Barons, in good fayth tyll ye can tell me a wyser tale of my new mother / I myght thynke my selfe a

                  ole, yf for suche a tale as you tell I wold leue of myne old.
               And thus are we now good reders wyth these onely woman vsynge no reason but suche as a woman myght fynd, and yet suche as no man maye soyle, comen to a poynte of frere Barns vnperfayt tokens, by whych we may so knowe his chyrche, as we be neuer the nerer for the knowledge of yt, for any knowledge that he geueth vs of yt.
               But nowe yf he haue not proued vs his chyrche at all / then is he ye wote well myche ferther of from makynge vs haue any knowledge of her. For he muste make vs fyrste know that suche one there is, byfore he make vs know in what company some of her partes be.
               
                   Now wote ye well that the chyrche whyche he toke vppon hym to proue, muste be a chyrche so clene and so pure wythout spotte or wryncle, that saynt Peter may fynde no faute in her. Nowe where as he goth aboute to proue yt by two meanes / one by the scrypture, and a nother by the doctours of the chyrche: I haue all redy proued you that all the places of scripture that he hath brought in for that purpose, he hath in suche wyse handeled, that whyle he lyueth he may be a shamed therof. For they not onely proue nothynge for hym / but also p

               And all his places of the doctours of the chyrch that he bringeth in for the proue of that purpose, I haue purposely differred, bycause I wold answere thē to gether laste at all. For syth he taketh in ye poynt another way then Tyndale  doth, or Fryth, or lightly any other heretike of thē all, in layenge forth for his part holy doctours of ye chyrch, to make it seme that the olde holy sayntes say for hys parte: I haue thought yt therfore good to examyne them orderly eche after other / wherby ye shall shortely perceyue that the wordis of those holy doctours do no more proue his purpose, then do the textes that he brought of the scryptures, whyche as I haue proued you clerely proue agaynst hym.
               His fyrste authoryte be these wordes of sayntt Austayn in his fyftieth sermone, made vpon the wordes of our lord, sayenge, Of Cryste is y• chyrch made fayre. Fyrste was she fylthy in synnes, afterward by pardon & grace made fayre. Uppon these wordes saynt Austayne none other meaneth, but that all the beauty of any that is in the chyrche and in

any man of the chyrche cōmeth of god / and that euery man  that is of the chyrche was borne in synne / and that all they whyche fro the Iewes or Gentyles turned to god and cam to the chyrche, hadde byfore lyued in synne, and were therfore fylthy, tyll by the sacrament of baptysme at theyr entre into the chyrche they were purged & clensed fro theyr synne by the grace and pardon of god and the sacrament of baptysme, and after when they be defoyled agayne by synne, they be agayne clensed, purged, and made fayre, by grace and perdon of god and the sacrament of penaūce, and other holy sacramentes takynge theyr effecte, strength, and vertue of Crystes passyon. But he fyndeth not in all that sermon any worde, wherin saynt Austayne sayth, that who so euer is onys clensed and made fayre ys neuer after foule /  nor that as sone as he is by any dedely synne foule, he is by and by no parte of holy chyrche. For holy chyrche is not called holy, because euery peyce therof is holy otherwyse then the holynesse, but bycause of that holynesse that is in yt besyde / of theyr professyon, nor is not called fayre bycause euery parte is fayre, but bycause of such fayrenes as is in it besyde / as there may be some weke parte in a strong bodye, and some sore part 
                     •
                  n a hole body, ye & some dede parte in a quicke body, & some foule part in a fayre body, & some whit parte in a blakke body / & in a good cōpany some naughtye folke. And in such maner spake our sauyoure to his apostles, where he sayd, you be clene / not yt they were al clene / for he forth wyth added vnto yt, but ye be not all clene / meanynge by Iudas the traytoure that was one of them / and  though he was a traytour in his herte,
                     Iohan. 13
                   was yet a foule vnholy member of that fayre holy chyrche. Lyke as yf a good kynge had in his chekker roule attendyng dayly vppon hym in his housholde dyuerse & many false traytours that went about secretly to betraye hym, all the whyle they be suffered there tyll they be taken for ther treason and put out / they be styll of the courte and of the kynges houshold. And the houshold, all be yt that some wyll say there was a shrewed housholde, bycause yt had suche shrewes in yt / yet was yt for all that a good housholde, bycause yt had good besyde.
               Aud lykewyse as in the whole world, the varyete of good partes & bad, geueth a beauty to ye whole / so in the chyrche of Cryste hym selfe seeth how the foule partes do sette oute

                   the fayre, & rather bewtyfye then blemmyshe the goodlynes of the whole. And though the chyrche be of some foulke called fowle,

                   for those persons that are by dedely synne fowle therin / as the euangelyste sayde that the dyscyples murmured at the losse of the oyntement wherat none of them murmured but one: so is she fayre for all that in dede by the fayrenesse that is in her, bothe by reason of Chryst her gloryouse hed, and of many other fayre membres that are euer in her, and by reason of the goodly composycyon and cūly temperature of the whole body. For whyche cause the chyrche maye well saye of it selfe, the wordes that she speketh in the cantycles:

                   but yet am I bewtyfull. ye and though there be mo fowle thā fayre therin, by reason wherof after the comon vse it myghte be called fowle and not  fayre / as a man of Inde is called blacke for all hys whyte tethe: yet is it otherwyse here, for the tother special causes. The tone for that be it neuer so vnholy in lyuynge, it is called holy for that it hath holy professyon, wherby it is dedycated vnto Chryst. The secunde

                   that there is in thys world none holy that goth to any other chyrche out of it, or that wyll not be of it. The thyrde cause is, for that the holynesse that is in it be there neuer so few holy therin, is farre fayrer and holyer, and more plesaunt in the syght of god, than the fowlenesse and vnholynesse of all that are fowle & vnholy therin / specyally for the bewtye and holynesse of the very cheyfe & pryncypall hed therof our sauyour Cryst hym self.
               And therfore as I saye, these wordes of saynt Austayne  menyng none other wyse by them thā saynt Austayn ment in them, make no thynge in thys worlde for frere Barons chyrch that is as he sayth so fayre that it hath neyther spot therin nor wryncle / for that sayth not saynt Austayne. And therfore thys place of saynte Austayne no thynge helpeth hym / but by other places of saynt Austayne whych I shall brynge you forth after, ye shall se the mynde of saynte Austayne so playnely declared in thys poynt agaynste frere Barns, yt frere Barns shall be as wery of saynte Austayns wordes, as euer he was wery of saynte Austayns wurkes / for werynes wherof he ronne out of saynte Austayns rule.

               Now good readers, thys texte of saynt Austayne hath frere Barns alledged to be in his sermone .99. that he made de t
                        •
                     mpore / in whyche sermon I fynde it not. And leste there myghte haue ben some ouersyghte, eyther in hym self or in the prenter, by mysse wrytynge or by mysse prentyng those fygurs of algorysme, bycause the fygure of .9. & the fygure of .6. be all in maner one yf they be contrary turned: I assayed them therfore euery way / and sought & red ouer not  onely .99. sermon whyche he assygneth, but also .96.69. and 66 / and I fynde his texte in none of all those places / and thā to go seke tohse wordes thorowout all saynt Austayns wurkes, were a great longe besynesse. For surely it semeth that the man hath alledged hys texte in a wronge place, of purpose bycause he wolde not haue it founden, for some thynge that hym self seeth of lykelyhed in the same sermon that wolde marre all hys mater. wherfore tyll it happen me to fynde the place by chaunce in redynge of saynte Austayns wurkes / we wyll take the wordes onely whych hym selfe reherseth / & than proue they no pyece of hys purpose agaynst the knowen catholyke chyrche. For saynt Austayn doth in those wordes no thyng ellys, but shew yt the chyrch is not restrayned vnto any one coūtre, as those heretykes  held whyche were called the Donatystes, whyche sayde the very chyrche was onely in Affryque, & was by god prouyded to rest there & sprede no ferther abrode / & for the defence of theyr frantyke heresye, dyd as frere Barns & these other heretykes do now, bryng forth certayn wordes of scripture cōstrewed after theyr owne folysh fantasye. But saynt Austayne as I say sheweth in those wordes, that the chyrch is the catholyke chyrch, yt is to say the vniuersall multytude of all trew chrystē people & all faythfull chrysten nacyons where so euer they be thorow the worlde. Now good reder what maketh thys for frere Barons purpose in profe of hys vnknowen chyrche, agaynste the k
                     •
                  owen catholyque chyrche? well he woteth hym sel
                     •
                  e that the knowen catholyke chyrch, doth not say yt the chirch is nor can be but ī one cūtrey / but he well knoweth that by the knowen catholyke

                   chyrche, that false heresye of the Donatystes is as fully cō
                  dempned as are these other false heresyes of hys.
               yes sayth Barns / for here ye maye se lo, yt neyther pope nor cardynall be no more of thys chyrche than the poreste man in erth. why who sayed hym euer naye therof? But what is that to the purpose? for as a pore man is as well of the chyrche as is the pope / so is a cordener as well an englysshe man or a frenche man, as is the kynge of eyther other cuntre. But yet lyke as reason wyl not agre, that the cordener in hys cuntre bere as myche rule as the kynge: so wyll it not agre wyth reason, that euery man in the chyrche bere as mych rule as the pope / whom frere Barons dothe hym self here in this same processe of the chirch knowledge and confesse for Chrystes vicar in the chyrche.
               
                   And therfore it is all besyde the purpose that he runneth forth styll in thys purpose, and alledgeth these wordes of Lyranus. The chyrche doth not stande in men by the reason of spyryt: all power or secular dygnyte / for many prynces and many popys and other inferior persons haue swarued fro the fayth. wherfore that chyrche doth stan

But I haue loked ouer Lyre vppon all that chapyter / and there fynde I no suche sayenge.

               Barns wold here seme lo to haue foundē a great thyng in Lyre his worde. But in good fayth I fynde nothynge here in Barons owne wordes but hys owne dowble foly. Fyrste he sayeth Lyre condempneth the lawe / and than he sheweth that he speketh not agaynste the lawe but agaynst a glose. Is n

                  t that worde wysely proued?
               
                  Then se yet how wysely he proueth that Lyre reproueth  the glose, he sayth that ye glose sayth that god suffereth not the chyrche of Rome to erre, and Lyre sayeth playne that many popes haue erred. And what than? Lyre 
                     •
                  ayth not yt the chyrch of Rome hath erred, nor Lyre sayth not that the pope of Rome is the whole chyrche of Rome / no more than the bysshoppe of London is the whole chyrche of London, or the archebysshoppe of Canterbery the whole chyrche of the prouynce.
               Now where Lyra sayth that the chyrche standeth not in the dygnyte, but in the confessyon of Cryste and hys blessed veryte: what sayth he other then all the hole catholyke chyrche agreeth / not onely the good folke but the noughty to as many as any wytte haue to perceyue the thing. Lyke as a cytye and a realme standeth not so mych by the dygnytye  of the rulers, as it standeth by wysdome, good order, true dealynge, and iustyce. But yet as these thynges wold fayle in a cytye and in a realm
                     •
                  , yf there were no rulers to se them kepte / ye and the rulers beynge of a ryghte seconde sorte, yet wolde the people be myche worse yf they were all wythout. And the people is therfore boūden to obay them, and not euery lewde felow to ieste and rayle vppon them: so is it in the whole chyrche also. And therfore no man fyndeth any fawte wyth Lyra, neyther to burne hym nor to be angry wyth hym / but euery good man hathe good cause bothe to be angry and to burne vppe to, suche pestylent sedycyouse persons as not onely by iestynge, raylynge, and bylinge all those that are in dygnyte, prouoke to rebellyon the people that sholde obaye them / but also vnder pretexte  of techynge the trewe fayth, laboure to destroye the trewe fayth, and infecte good chrysten peple wyth false poysened heresyes. And amonge all those, one of the very wurst sort, and wheruppon all the remanaunt are in a maner byelded, wolde vnder colour of berynge fauour to the good vertuouse people that are in the chyrche, make men byleue that the whole chyrche wherof those good men be part, were not the chyrche in dede, bycause they wolde haue it vnknowen that men myghte haue no suretye of any trewe doctryne, but that heresyes myghte passe vncontrolled, whyle euery lewd felow myght constre the scrypture as hym selfe lyste, & no chyrche prouyded of god, to controlle hym and iudge who constrewed wronge, & by whyche chyrche men myghte

                   be sure of the necessary trouth.
               And yet to make yt the more vncertayne and the more vnsure / Barons bryngeth the chyrch here in erthe to that kynde of goodnes, that except suche as be new crystened or very yonge, and yet scante they eyther, whyche be not yet ye wote well very mete to be made preachers: ellys saynte Austayne whome Barons bryngeth for hym, sayth playne agaynste hym, that there is in erthe no suche / as I shall a none by his playne wordes proue you.
               But fyrst for the place of saynte Austayne whych of Barons bryngyng in I laste rehersed you / ye se that saynt Austayne sayth in them no more, but that the chyrche was not onely the crysten people present at his sermone, nor onely those crysten peple & were in that citye, nor onely those that  were in Afryke, but also all the faythfull crystē people that were in the worlde besyde. In whyche wordes he sayth so litle for frere Barns purpose, that I which dispute agaynst hym, say the same thynge my selfe, that all crysten nacyōs professyng the trew fayth of Cryst, that is to say the comen catholyke fayth wherin the knowen catholyque chyrch agreeth, be the very holy chyrche of Cryste here in erth, and make amonge them the comen knowen catholique chyrch / of whyche the very good men are parte, and are all called the faythfull people of Cryste, bycause of the vnyte of the trew fayth of Cryste. In whyche as for the necessary poyntes this whole corps agreeth wythout contradyccyon and repugnaunce bothe good people and badde. And therfo
                     •
                  e  are they called all by that name, to make a distynccyon and seueraunce betwene that one catholyque chyrche of one bylyefe and fayth on the tone parte, and all myscreaunt paynyms, all false Iewes, all false heretyques, and all sedycyouse scysmatyques vppon the tother parte: of all whych as no secte agreeth wyth other / so do they all impugne the trew fayth of the knowen catholyque chyrch / in whych and of whyche be also all the vnknowen good vertuouse people, that haue trew cheryte with theyr fayth. But saynt Austayne meaneth not, that lyke as all the chyrch be faythfull, that is to say agreynge to gether in the trew bylyef, so they be all the mayny vertuouse in all poyntes bysyde / and specyally so fully vertuouse and holy
                     •
                   as holy frere Barons appoynteth pure and clene wythout spot or wryncle.
               For lettynge other places of saynte Austayne alone for

the whyle / loke but vppon this place onely that we be in  hand wyth all / whyche yf I myghte fynde ones in his proper place, I sholde I wene se farther thynges therin. But now consider no more for our purpose agaynst Barns, but euyn the begynnynge of saynte Austayne wordes as Barons bryngeth them in hym selfe. Lo thus he begynneth. The holy chyrche are we / but I do not say we as one sholde say we that be here all onely, but as many as be faythfull Chrysten men in this chyrche &c. How thynke you good reders. Dothe saynt Austayne here meane by faythfull Crysten, no mo but onely suche as this faythlesse frere assygneth / that is onely those that are not onely faythfull in the byleuynge the necessarye poyntes of the crysten fayth, but that were in theyr soule also bysyde so thorowly pure and clene, that they hadde not so myche  as eyther spot or wryncle in theym. As though saynte Austayne wolde say to his audiēce in his sermon in this wyse: wyll ye know good crysten people who be trewe members of holy chyrche. That shall I shortely shew you lo. Not euery body that byleueth ryght / but we, that is to say you and I that not onely byleue ryght, but also be holy pure & clene wythoute eyther spot or wryncle.
               But yet when I say we be the chyrch: I meane not you & I only, as though there were no mo of the chyrch but my selfe and such other of you, as beynge at my sermon be such holy men as I am / but also all suche other as be so pure and clene wythout spot or wryncle, as you & I be, where so euer they be, eyther in this towne or in this countrey, or elles where in all this wyde worlde.
               
               Lo good reders / yf saynt Austayne ment as Barns maketh, that in this worde faythfull crysten folke makynge the whole chyrche, he ment not all crysten people that agre in professyon of fayth wyth the whole corps of crystendom, but onely suche as besydes the profession of the trew fayth, were also so holy, pure, and clene, that they neyther haue spot nor wryncle: then were this tale in effe
                     •
                  te as I haue rehersed you, that he called hym selfe suche a perfyte holy man / whych worde I wene neuer man herde of his mouth.
               For there is no crysten man, but he may and muste professe of hym selfe, that he byleueth ryght and hath the trew fayth. But there be not I suppose many good holy men, that wyll say of them selfe, that they be holy, pure, & clene, and specyally wythout spot or wryncle. And therfore yt appereth

                   well, that this worde faythfull crysten folke, is not alway taken and ment by hym that speketh yt, for onely pure and clene holy men. And so those wordes of saynt Austayne nothynge make for frere Barons.
               And therfore ye maye se that in lykewyse doth Barons mysse take the glose that he alledgeth dis. 24. A recta / which sayth that the chyrch whych can not erre, is ecclesia omniū fidelium, that is to say the chyrche of all faythfull folke. whyche wordes frere Barons taketh, as though the wryter there by these worde (all faythfull men) hadde ment no mo but all suche as were not onely trew byleuers, but also suche as were so pure and clene that they neyther had spot nor wryncle. But the wryter of that glose meneth nothyng so / but meaneth as saynt Austayne ment in his wordes byfore  rehersed, callynge all faythfull folke, all cristen p

                  ch as I saye, and not of any vnknowen chyrche as Barons wolde haue yt seme: euery man may perceue that can and wyll consyder well the place. For in that glose his purpose is no more, but to shew that there is more suerty of doctrine  in the consent of the whole chyrch, that is to wyt the whole corps of crystendome to gether, then in the chyrch of Rome alone. And therfore that glose can nothyng serue frere Barons / but yt vtterly destroyeth frere Barons false glosyng of saynte Austaynes wordes, & openeth well vnto vs what thynge saynte Austayne ment in this worde, all faythfull men. For surely neyther saynte Austayne nor that glose, ment by these wordes omniū fidelium, men clene and pure wythout any spotte or wryncles, no more then doth euery man that prayeth pro omnibus fidelibus, that god maye make theym all good men / or pro animabus omniū fideliū defunctorum, that yt may please god to bryng them to heuen all such as are in the paynfull way thether warde / men do not meane in the prayours onely such faytfull folke as

neyther haue spotte nor wryncle of synne.
               
               Now where that the glose sayth, there muste nedes be suche a chyrch so say I to. For I say playnly that ye chyrch muste nedes be. For all the deuylles in hell, nor all theyr instrumentes vpon erth, shall neuer be able to destroy yt, but pull they neuer so many from yt, & leue they the remanaūt neuer so few: yet shall the remanaunt alway be the chyrch, and a well knowen chyrche, to byelded vppon that hygh mountayne, that is to wyt vppon Cryst, that yt shall alway be syghtely & can not be hydde. For as our sauyour sayth: The cytye that is set vppon a mountayne can not be hyd / meanynge that his chyrche shold be well sene, and his trew fayth well knowen / and not that his chyrche in whych hys fayth sholde contynue, and in whyche & of whyche yt shold be lerned, sholde be suche an vnknowen thynge as they  that wolde lerne: coulde neyther wote where to fynde yt, nor of whome to aske for yt, nor so myche as know yt yf yt fortuned them to fall vppon yt by happe, as frere Barons wolde here brynge yt to.
               Also the tother glose that Barons bryngeth forth, De pene dis. 2. Si, that sayth, The whole chyrche can not erre: what maketh that glose for Barons? He speketh agaynste Barons. For Barons sayth that his owne chyrche whyche hym selfe assygneth, though she can not erre whyle she cleueth to her spouse / yet she may leue hym and fall from him, and then erre. And so this glose that Barns bryngeth, saith clere agaynst hym / how be yt no more then he semeth to do hym selfe. For yf yt be trew that he sayth of his chyrch that she may fall from god and not heare her husband, and then  therby erre: then is yt false that he sayth in a nother place, that there muste nedes be suche a chyrche as can not erre / whyche thynge he wolde proue by this glose of the lawe that saith, The whole chyrch can not erre. And yet ye se wel that this glose takyng yt after the beste fashyon for it, saith not as Barons sayeth, that the very chyrche is no mo but that very secrete sorte of faythfull folke that be wythout any errour, and y• be pure & clene wythoute spot or wryncle / but he sayth that the whole chyrch that is to wit the knowē catholyque chyrche, can not all erre / but that though that god wold suffer some partis or mēbers of his chyrch to erre, yet he will not suffer the whole corps or body of hys chyrch to erre. This maketh playne agaynste Barons, that bryngeth

                   it forth. For it affermeth that the trewth alwaye remayneth in the knowen catholyke chyrche / for of ye knowē chyrche he speketh there.
               I can not therfore meruayle inough of Barns in bryngyng forth these gloses for him, that make so clere agaynst hym / and than to se him so boldely say therupon, These wordes be playne what chyrche it is that can not erre. As though these gloses had sayd as he sayth, yt the chyrch which cā not erre is onely the vnknowē chyrch of folke pure & clene without any spot or wryncle / of which thynges neyther nother glose speketh one worde. And yet where Barns sayth: These wordes of these gloses be playne: as playne as he maketh them of them selfe / yet hath hym selfe made a playne chaūge of one worde in the tone of them, to make it seme the more playne  for hym. For where he reherseth the glose by these wordes: The hole chyrch can not erre / this worde erre is not there / but the very wordes be, The whole chyrche can not fayle. Than be not ye wote well those wordes erre & fayle, precysely & playnely both one, neyther in wrytyng nor in voyce, nor yet in sygnyfycacyon / no more than the two laten wordes errat and deficit. For a man may fayle & yet not erre. As he that doth auowtry & woteth wel he doth nought / he fayleth and falleth from god, & yet erreth he not in fayth.
               A man maye also erre & yet not fayle nor fall awaye fro god / syth euery errour is not dampnable, As a man myght erre and not fayle nor fall fro god therby nor be dampned therfore / as Iacob dyd in wenyng that Lya had bene Rachell / or as hys father Isaac dyd in wenynge that Iacob  had ben Esau.
               But I say not thys, for that I care mych for his chaūge But I mene that I wolde not haue hym come forth and make such great bostes of the playnesse of the wordes, whā he hath hym selfe made a chaunge in them, to make theym seme the more playne for hym / and whan the wordes for all hys playne chaunge, make yet so playne agaynste hym.
               But veryly me thynketh that in one thynge he vseth no good honeste fashyon, in that he sayth fyrste: Thys maye be proued by our owne lawe, whose wordes be these: the whole chyrche can not er

               Hys quotacyō is in the mergyn in thys maner. De pene. dis. 2. Si in glossa. For these wordes, The whole chyrche can not erre. And than for the tother wordes, that is, The congregacyon of faythfull men must nedes be, whych also can not erre / his quotacyō is in the mergent thus .24. que. 1. A recta et in glossa. So that he wold we sholl wene that at the leste wyse those wordes were bothe in the texte and in the glose.
               
               But now who so loke vpon these two lawys, shall soone se that the cause why he dyd not, was bycause he durste not. For the law .24. que. 1. A recta, speketh clere agaynste hym. For that law sayth no thynge ellys, but that the very trew fayth wythout errour, hath bene euer preserued in the see apostolyke / and as the lawe calleth it there, the mother of all chyrches the chyrche of Rome. And therfore thys lawe ye se wel was not for hys purpose to brynge in / but in stede of the law he layeth vs forth a pache of the glose.
               Now the tother law de pene. dis. 2. Si / that law durst he not brynge forth for fere of angeryng hys euangelycall brother Tyndale. For that lawe is the wordes of holy saynte Hierom / wherin he confuteth at great length, those heretykes that than helde the selfe same heresyes that Tyndale  holdeth now, that they which be onys borne of god can neuer after synne. And the tother, that he which after his baptysme doth onys any dedely synne, shall neuer gete forgyuenes after. These two deuelysshe heresyes which Tyndale hath now begon agayn in hys false exposycyon of the fyrst pystle of saynt Iohn̄ which false exposycyon of hys I haue before cōfuted in my fourth boke: holy saynt Hierom doth at good length openly confute, in the wordes whiche are there by Graciane incorporate in the decrees. whiche wordes yf my selfe hadde remembred in tyme / I wolde haue broughte theym in, in the stede of myne owne, and wolde peraduenture haue lefte myne owne out for theym. For there sayeth saynte Hierome the selfe same thynges

                   agaynst those other heretykes of old, yt I say there agaynst thys new / and (as he better coulde) sayth them farre better thā euer I shalbe able / as I wold make you sone perceyue yf I coulde in translatynge hys wordes into our englyshe tong, gyue it the quyknesse and strength that he gyueth it in the laten.
               But as I sayd, thys lawe durste not frere Barns bryng in for fere of Tyndale, whyche wolde for hurtynge of hys heresyes haue founden hym braulynge inough for all hys lyfe after. But Barns wyll I warraunt you gyue hym no suche occasyon of dyspleasure.
               Now yf Barons answere me, that he hadde no cause to bryng in any of both those lawes, syth they made no thyng for hys purpose but the gloses onely: I shall tell hym agayne,  that than he sholde not haue sayed it that he wolde proue hys purpose by the lawes, but by the gloses onely. And I say also that than he shold haue lefte out the gloses to. For as the lawes proue not hys purpose, no more do the gloses neyther, as I haue clerely declared you.
               And yet whan he hath handeled hym self so falsely, and yet so folyshly therwyth in the alledgynge of these lawes, that yf he hadde any sparke of shame lefte in hys body, he myghte not well loke any man in the face for fere that these hys false folyes were espyed: it is now a worlde to se wyth what a corage and boldenesse he bosteth and reioyceth, and what a ioye he maketh, as he were euyn made a kynge by the fyndynge of a bene in a chrystmas cake. For now he calleth hys lordes about hym and sayth, Now my lordes gather you  all to gyther wyth all the lawes that ye can make, and all the holynesse that you can deuyse, and crye, the chyrche, the chyrche, and the counse

For you come afore hym / that is you come into the foulde of Chryst wythout hym you brynge not his voyce / but you come with your owne voyce, with youre owne statutes, wyth your owne worde, and with your owne

For you be not taught of god / you haue not the holy oyntemente, you haue not the worde of god for you / you here not the voyce of the trewe sheaperd. Therfore must you nedes erre in all your counselles.
               
               
                  what grounde or colour of grounde hath he to reigne so  lordely and rayle so ryally vppon all the lawes? May he so boldely sette them all at nought, bycause hym selfe hath so falsely bylyed twayne, and so folyshely handeled theyr gloses. No Sowdan in a stage play may make mo braggyng bostys, nor ronne out in mo frantike ragys, than may frere frātyke Barns yf he take thys for reason. For here speking of lawes, and layeng but the gloses / and the lawes agaynst hym, and hys gloses nothynge for hym: yet as though all the worlde were hys, he falleth forth in a rage agaynste all lawys, and all generall counsayles / and sayth, They haue not the voyce of god with them / but they muste nedes erre in all theyr counsayles, by cause they say mandamus, mandamus, praecipimus, praecipimus, excommunicamus, excommunicamus. For he sayth that these wordes be the voyces of murtherers and theuys and not of Cryste.
               
               Thys felow cometh forth wyth a prowde face vpon all the worlde, whan he wolde by his pryncely authoryte more than an imperyall maiestye, proclayme all men for murderers and theuys, that dare be so bolde as to vse any of these wordes mandamus, precipimus, or excōmunicamus. These wordes I se not sent out by murtherers nor theuys, but by prynces and rulers agaynst murderers and theuys and agaynst all other vycyouse and mysse ruled persons, and amonge other agaynste vngraciouse heretykes, which is all thys mannys gryefe.
               And that these wordes of cōmaundynge haue bene vsed by folke somwhat better then theuys and murderers, may appere by the scrypture it selfe. For the holy eu
                     •
                  ngelyste  saynt Marke sayeth of our sauyour thus: He commaunded hys apostles that they sholl cary no thynge wyth them as they went by the waye. And saynt Poule wryteth vnto the Thessalonyes in thys wyse: O my bretherne, I truste in god of yow that ye kepe and wyll kepe all thynges that I haue commaunded you. And agayne to Timothe thus he sayth: I commaunde the before god &c.
               And thus frere Barns maye se, that the wordes of commaundynge, be not alwaye the voyce of murderers and theuys.
               But all the greate gryefe of thys mater is in excommunicamus. For that worde wolde frere Barns haue dāpned. But yet muste he consyder that saynt Poule hym selfe vsed eyther that same worde or some other in the language that

                   he spake, when he dyd excommunycate and accurse Hymineus and Alexāder, and bytoke them to the deuyll to teche them to leue theyr blasphemy, suche as these heretyques vse now, and yet peraduenture lesse / for greater yt coulde not be.
               Saynte Poule also commaunded the Corynthies, that they shold excōmunicate and accurse oute of theyr cōpany,

                   that incestuouse lecherour that had abused his own faders wyfe. For thus he sayth in the fyrst pystle to the Corynthies Trewly I beynge absent in body but yet present in spyryt, haue all redy determined as though I were present, of him that hath thus done, when you are gathered to gether and my spyryte in the name of our lorde Iesu Cryste, in vertue of oure lorde Iesu, delyuere hym to the deuyll for the punyshement  of the fleshe, that the spyryt may be saued in the day of our lorde Iesu Cryste.
               God also dyd accurse and excommunycate Lucyfer and all his proude felowes out of heuen.
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   But bycause there neded no voyce in that / therfore wyll frere Barons saye that there was none excōmunicamus. But yet at the daye of iugemēt, our sauyour shall say to them that wyll do no good workes, but wene by frere Barns doctrine that onely fayth sholde saue them / to them shall he say: Go ye cursed wreches into euerlastynge fyre, whyche is prepared for the deuyll and his angelis. Here shall our sauyour hym selfe vse an excomunicamus / from whyche I pray god for hys mercy so mende frere Barons and me bothe, that we fall not in it. For that is a sorer excōmunicamus then any man  vseth now / wherwyth many shalbe murdered in soule, not by any crueltye vpon his parte, but by iustice thorow theyr own dedes. And therfore excōmunicamus is not the voyce of onely murderers and theuys, as frere Barns maketh it.
               But surely good reders ye must pardon hym. For yt apreth that the man was in a sore fyt of a fury, when he fell in to this rage / the fumes wherof ascended so hote vp to hys hed, that he raued and wyste nere what he sayde. And in that dysease he can not tell how myche harme he doth hym selfe, wyth lettynge his crowne grow so. For his heere kepeth his hed to hote.

For though some one mā myght in some one mater be of a better mynd at the fyrste then the multytude / yet in a counsayle of wyse men when it were purposed, yt were lykely to be perceyued and alowed. And in a counsayle of crysten men in spyryt of god inclyneth euery good man to declare hys mynde, and inclyneth the congregacion to consente and agree vppon that that shall be the beste, eyther precysely the beste, or the beste at the leste wyse for the season: whyche when so euer yt shall be better at any other tyme to chaūge the same spyryte of god inclyneth his chyrche eyther at a new counsayle, or by as full and whole consent as any coūsayle can haue, to abrogate the fyrste & turne yt into the better. But when the counsayle and the congregacion agreeth and consenteth  vppon a p

               But now bycause frere Barns saith yt the cause why the counsayles may erre, is bycause they be not the whole catholyque chyrche, but onely by way of representacyon / and sayth that the whole vnyuersall chyrch standeth in the eleccyon of all faythfull men / and that all faythfull men of the worlde make the vnyuersall chyrche, whose hed and spouse is Cryste Iesus, and the pope vycare vnder Cryste, and cō

And syth they call that tyme the tyme of thys .viii. hundred yeres last passed: lette vs take the tyme in whyche saynt Gregory was pope / for that is now more than .ix. hundred yere a go. And saynte Gregory was a good man and a good pope, and so good that I thynke none heretyke dare for shame saye the contrarye.

And therupon Luther hym selfe hauyng the wordes wherof he wolde neuer lacke plenty (tyll fransye lacke foly) wold there not onely defende, but also boste hys bestely maryage  and saye that vowys of chastyte coude bynde no man, for no man oughte to make theym / but it were synne and presumpcyon for any man to make them, but yf he hadde that gyfte gyuen hym of god, for it is a thynge whyche euery man can not do, and a gyfte whyche no man can gyue hym selfe, but yf it be gyuen hym of god. And therfore who so maketh any suche vowe, wenynge that he haue the gyfte bycause he feleth no contrary grudge at that tyme / yet whā so euer he feleth after any flessh

And that he maye now therfore ronne out of his relygyon, and folow the flesshe. And whan he fyndeth a nonne that feleth the  lyke, and that eche of theym fele other, and lyke well eche other for theyr felynge fayth / than maye they bothe be sure that they maye boldely breke both theyr vowes, and wedde theym selfe to gyther. And therhy shall they fele by theyr flesshely felyng fayth, that they two be two specyall electes predestynate by god byfore the worlde was wrought to go to gether in this world and brynge forth holy frute to serue the deuyll at hys dyner.
               what wolde the generall counsayle of the whole chyrch haue sayd vnto that frere, and what vnto flekke hys make, and what vnto that deuely

               And I am sure that so wolde it haue ben, yf any man durste there haue holden any one of many other heresyes, that these felowes holde now.
               Than what myghte Luther and Barns haue sayed to that generall counsayle. For that were the counsayle that coulde

               How yf frere Barns, & frere Luther, and wyllyam Tindale, wolde than haue sayed that the very chyrche dyd not condempne them / for the very chyrche was not that greate multytude that there condempned them of heresye / but the very chyrche was them selfe that there were condempned and persecuted for the truth, and such other good faythfull folke as were vnknowen amonge that company, and secretely agreed wyth them in faythe, that no vowe of chastyte shold let them, but that freres and nonnes myght lawfully wedde whan they lyste: To thys wold saynt Gregory sone haue answered & sayd syrs they yt are ye good faythfull folke

               To thys must it nedes haue comen ye se well good readers, there were none other remedy. And whā it were onys comen vnto that / than were it no dowte but that Luther, Barns, & Tyndale, wolde not haue letted to say / Mary we with Luthers wyfe

               And saynte Gregory wolde peraduenture haue meruayled, yf saynte Poule wolde haue sayde as frere Barons bereth vs in hande he sayd, that crystendome were onely byelded vppon the apostles and prophetes / for yt is moste specyally byelded vppon our sauyoure hym selfe, and so myghte saynte Poule in those wordes very well and properly meane sayeng / ye be byelded vppon the foundacyon of the apostles and prophetes / that is to say, ye be byelded  vppon the same foundacyon that they be byelded on, that is to wyt Cryste, that is and was the very foundacyon as well of them, as of you, though they were layed on byfore and you after / yet the very foundacyon vppon whyche ye be byelded and they bothe, is that corner stone that is layed in the hed of the angle that ioyneth both the sydes in one.

                  re Barons so taketh saynt Poules wordes there vnto the Ephesyās / as though saynte Poule had sayde vnto them, The foundacyon that ye be byelded vppon, is the wrytynge that the prophetes &  the apostles haue wryten for your edyfycacyon / and therfore must you se that you byleue nothyng, nor do nothyng but suche as you fynd wryten in the wrytynges of the prophetes and the apostles / then yf they had neuer a boke wryten of the apostles that were at that tyme comē to theyr handes, as yt was lykely there was not / howe wold then those wordes frame?
               And also yf he ment but so / then toke he away the authoryte from all the scrypture besyde / except onely the writyng of the apostles and prophetes, and from all that hym selfe tolde them bysyde by mouth.
               But yet yf frere Barons wolde there haue sayde vnto saynte Gregory all those wordes wyth whyche in his boke here he rayleth on by and by agaynste the thynges vsed in

the knowen catholyque chyrch, belles, bokes, candelles, vestymentes, chalyces, holy crysme, oyle, and holy water, and watchyng, forberynge fleshe, drynkynge of water, fastyng, and prayenge, which Barns calleth paterynge, & mūblyng of these psalmes and those psalmys wythout deuocyon / as though hym selfe hadde an y

                  uously and full. And as for such workis as be vycyouse in dede, whyche Barons planteth in amonge these as though all were of one sort / saynt Gregory wold agre thē for nought / and so do they to that vse them. But yet wolde saynte Gregory tell hym that yf he were honeste or trew, he sholde not lay the fautes of the noughtye partes to the blame of the whole body / in whych be many full good. And specyally yf  he wold dysprayse the euyll workes, he sholde not yet as he doth disprayse & call euyll the thynges that are very good, and whyche deuoutely done (as wyth many they be) are greatly plesaunt to god / and specyally he shold not among other thynges dispyse and reproue belles for callyng folke to goddes seruyce / nor vestymentes, candelles, bokes, and chalyces, wythout which or at the laste wyse wythout some of whyche neyther masse may be sayde, nor the blessed sacrament in the masse consecrated and receyued / but yf he wold haue euery prest haue al by hert, & the blessed blood of Crist wythout chalyce layed and lycked vp vpon the auter cloth.
               But then wolde saynte Gregorye haue sayde farther to frere Barons and to frere Luther to / that syth they were so precyse, that they wolde haue no workes wrought, but onely  such as they founde in scrypture he wolde: aske theym why they be runne both oute of relygyon / and the tone wedded a nunne,

               To the wordes of saynte Chrysostome saynte Gregorye wolde I trow haue answered frere Barns / that they were none of his. For yt is well perceyued and knowen that the worke whych is called Opus imperfectum, the unperfayt worke vppon the gospell of saynte Mathew, whych was fyrste by the erroure and ouersyght of some wryters intyteled vnto saynt Chrysostome, and the same tytle so suffred synnes to stande / was neuer his worke in dede, nor neuer translated

                   out of the greke but made by some lat
                     •
                  n man, as frere Barons hath all redy had suffycyent warnynge by mo thanne one, that can a lytell better skyll therof then I and he both / and I veryly byleue that agaynst hys owne conscyence he ascrybeth that wurke to saynt Chrysostom. For all be it the man was cūnyng, well spoken, & in many thynges wryteth very well / yet yf frere Barns haue redde that worke (except he vnderstand hym not, or els be him selfe bysyde his other heresyes an Arrian to) ellys muste he nedes perceyue that the man was infected with that faute / and therfore was it no meruayle though he wold as fayne brynge the very chyrche in questyon, & oute of knowledge as now frere Barns wold hym selfe. But saynt Chrysostom hym self in his own sermon vpō the self same wordes of the gospell, They that be in Iudea let them fle into the mountayns, whych is his  76. sermon vpon saint Mathew, hath not such a word. But he whom frere Barns here bryngeth, whose wurke was as I haue sayd by errour & ouersyght entiteled in the name of saynt Chrysostom. For as mych as by the authoryte of the chyrche, his heresye agaynst the godhed of Chryst was cō
                  dempned, dyd as euer more such men haue done, that is to wytte, labored fyrst to haue yf it could haue ben, theyr own secte taken for the very chyrche. For so wolde the Arryans haue semed to be, & the catholykes they called heretykes. And whan that thyng wold not be obtayned, than labored they that at the lest the very catholyke chyrch myght seme vncertayn, & be taken for a chyrche vnknowen / and hange vpon euery mannes dysputacyō, so that they myght ye better brynge theyr heresye forth styll in questyon, and begyle  here & there some vnlerned & new
                     •
                  angled people wyth the colour of theyr false expownynge of holy scrypture, whyle there shold be no certayn knowē chyrch, by whiche the trew exposycyon and the false sholde be dyscerned & iudged.
               And therfore that man albe it he was as it semeth in the tyme whan that heresye of the Arrians was almoste ouerwhelmed, & therfore durste not playnely speke myche of it / yet coulde he not hold but somwhat shew hym selfe in that worke in his .xix. sermon that he wryteth vpō these wordes, Attendite a falsis prophetis, wherin he not onely laboreth sore to mynyshe as mych as he maye the credence of the catholyke chyrch both cōcerning ye vertuose workes whych were vsed therin, & the myracles which were dayly done therin, which two thynges he perceyued to stand sore in his lyght for the

knowlege of ye catholike chyrch / but also inueheth agaynst  it and findeth a specyall hyghe faute with it, for bycause i
                     •
                   taught to byleue the egall godhed of the .iii. persons of the trinite. And therfore wolde saynt Gregory haue tolde frere Rarns that it was not saynt Chrysostome, but some man that was to be redde warely and wyth good iudgement, & in thys mater hys wordes worthy no credence.
               And yet yf frere Barns wold haue styc
                     •
                  en styll as styffely for y• wurke, as he doth agaynst the pystle of saint Iamys / & wolde nedes haue it taken for saynt Chrysostoms: than wold saynt Gregory haue told hym that the wordes which hym selfe bryngeth out of ye worke, be playne agaynst frere Barns hym self. For well ye wote that frere Barns techeth that the very catholyke chyrche is in this worlde a chyrche euer vnknowen. And he that wrote the wordes whiche Barons  bryngeth forth (whom he calleth saynt Chrysostome) sayth no more but that in some tymes the chyrche maye by reason of so great or so many sectes of heretykes arysen & sprongen vp therin, be brought in dowt & questyon whych of so many sectes or of some few so great were the very chyrche / & yet in all this meneth he, which knowen chyrch of the great, or of the many were the trew / & not as Barns wolde haue it that it were some few scatered persons vnknowen / here one and theron / eyther of them all or of diuers of them or of none of theym, but peraduenture men of some other kynde of fayth agreynge wyth none of them all.
               More ouer these wordes of saynt Chrysostome yf they were his do cōfesse that the very chyrch was onys knowen / and therfore wolde saynt Gregory tell frere Barns, yt they  do vtterly confounde frere Barns heresye. For hys heresye is, that the thyrche is such a spyrytuall thyng that neyther it self or any mēber or part therof at any tyme cā be knowē.
               Forthermore where in those wordes saynt Chrysostome yf those wordes & that worke were hys sayth that to know whych is ye chyrch we must flye to the scrypture, saynt Gregory wold tell frere Barns that syth saynt Chrysostom sendeth vs to the scrypture to know therby whych of all those dyuers chyrches / beyng to gyther all at one tyme / is ye very chirch / he meneth y• by the scrypture ye same chyrche may be knowen: wherof it foloweth agayn agaynste frere Barns that the selfe same wordes by whych he wold proue vs that the chyrch can not be knowen, do playnely confounde frere Barns / and saye that the chyrche may be knowen.
               And saynt Gregory could I wote well haue gyuen him

                   tokens inough open playne & euydent wryten in the playn scrypture, of whyche I haue my selfe shewed some all redy and mo shall I in the laste boke of thys worke, by whyche euery man may playnely perceyue, that this knowen catholyke chyrche is the very trewe chyrche of Cryste.
               Also saynt Gregory wolde haue tolde frere Barns, that whan saynt Chrysostome (yf those wordes were hys) dothe sende vs to seke the chyrche by the scrypture, he thought it necessary that the chyrche were founden. For els he myght haue sent theym onely to the scrypture, to lerne the trewe fayth and good lyuynge euery man by hym selfe, and leue the chyrche vnsought. But it appereth synnys he sendeth them to seke it there / he meaneth not onely that they there maye fynde the meanes to fynde it and know it, as I sayd  before / but also that to fynde it & know it, is a thyng so necessary that nedys it ought to be had / bycause of the trewe doctryne to be taught them by the same chyrche, as well in any other thyng that god hath by hys holy spyryte taught the same chyrche, as also in thynges necessary to saluacyon the trewe vnderstandynge of the same scrypture / and than syth he wolde that the readers of the scrypture shold fynd out the trew chyrch to lerne of it the trew exposycyon of the scripture, and of an vnknowen chyrch no man can lerne by gyuynge it credence as to the trew chyrch / theruppon wold saynt Gregory yet agayne conclude, that these wordes of saynt Chrysostome yf they were hys / do clerely confounde frere Barns. And therfore wolde he fynally put frere Barons in choce, whyther he wyl haue those wordes taken for  saynt Chrysostoms or no. If he wold not haue them taken for his / than wolde saynt Gregory byd hym go scrape that authoryte out of his boke agayne, & say no ferther but that one man wryteth thus but I wote nere who, sauynge that an Arrian he was. Now yf he wyll haue theym saynte Chrysostoms wordes, thā appereth it playne wolde saynt Gregory say, by y• same wordes y• saynt Chrysostom in the selfe same few wordes whiche Barons bryngeth forth for hym, doth .iiii. or .v. tymes clerely & playnely cōfoūde hym.
               Now yf these folke wolde yet haue stycked styll, and say the decre of that coūsayle made agaynst them was nought, for they them selfe onely be the very trewe chyrch of Cryst: than wolde saynte Gregory haue sayed at laste: why syrs how can that be? For ye wote well that of knowen chyrches there was neuer none that durste professe them selfe for the

very chyrche, but euer they founde theym selfe so farre in  that poynt to weyke, that they were fayne in conclusyon to say that the very chyrche was a secrete chyrche vnknowen, wherof some of them selfe myghte at the leste wyse be some parte. And thys do all you your own selfe so fully afferme, that neuer heretykes affermed it more styffely. Go to therfore wolde saynte Gregory saye to some offycer there present, and telle these felowes wyth a stycke, and let vs haue the nomber and the names. Now whan thys offycer hadde comen wyth hys stycke and patted them vppon the pates, and the cryour wyth hym / and as he hyt them, reherse them thus: frere Luther one, Cate hys nonne twayne, Tyndale thre, frere Barons foure: when here were all, than wolde saynt Gregory haue sayed / what here be but foure of you, and here be your names rehersed and your persons present  and you be all knowen, and your false fayth and abomynable bestely sectes by youre owne bestely professyon, all to gyther knowen, and therfore you can not be the chyrche of trewe good men vnknowen. For though an ipocryte maye be vnknowen for naught, yet he that by his open euyll and abomynable dedys doynge, and open professyon of false abomynable heresyes sheweth hym selfe naughte, can not be for that tyme secretely a good man. And so be you whā ye haue all babled, well and iustely condempned by the whole catholyke chyrche / whyche is also well knowen, and whyche by your owne reasons, and by Barns expresse wordes, is here well proued to be the chyrche that can not erre / and therfore it is well proued that all you do playnely and dāpnably erre.
               
               And ferthermore, syth they were than proued to be not the very chyrche after theyr owne doctryne, bycause they were than made open / syth of trouth they beyng open or secrete, is not the thynge that maketh it the trew chyrche, nor is the substaunce of the mater but an accydent therunto / it appereth playne that they whyche by beynge made open, be proued after theyr doctryne not to be the trewe chyrche, were alwaye a false chyrche before they were made open.
               But now suppose me farther that forthwyth after this / some man wolde amonge theym say vnto saynt Gregorye and to that whole assemble, that they were comen thyther to gether from all partes of the worlde, wyth theyr meruaylouse labour and theyr importable payne / and that nowe

                   theyr thre days vitayle that they brought frō home is more then halfe spent, & shall be great diffyculty for some of them that dwell farthest of, to gete home agayne wyth the remanaunt. And that therfore yf yt myghte so be thought good to the whole counsayle, whyle they were all the whole flok of all crysten people to gether vppon that fayre playne, yt were well done to take an order and make a lawe amonge them there, that for any nede that sholde at any tyme after happen, there sholde neuer more all the whole people be called agayne to gether / but oute of euery parte some couenyent number cōuenyently called to gether. And that such an assemble so gardered to gether, shold repsent y• whole peple, and sholde haue the selfe same authoryte full and whole, in all lawes after to be made, and all doutes of scrypture or  questyons of the catholyque fayth to be declared, that the very whole crysten people sholde haue yf they were all present there man, woman, and chylde / syth it were very lykely that the necessyte of a generall counsayle sholde often happen / and not well possyble that all the whole people beyng so mayne a multytude & dwellynge so farre a sonder, shold so often though yt happed so this onys, from all partes of the world come whole alway to gether to the generall coū

chyrch in dede, but as frere Barns saith only representatyue, sholde yet haue the same authoryte and the same full credence geuen vnto yt, as though there were a tyt all the whole crysten people.
               And thus ye se now that both in Luthers heresyes & Tyndales to & Barns also, touchyng the weddyng of freres & nonnes, and the authoryte of generall counsaylys, and the pro

               But now yf frere Barns wyl here say, that wyth all this ymagynacyon of suche an whole assemble at a generall coūsayle I can nothyng proue, bycause yt is but an imagynacyon  that neuer coulde come to passe: I answere hym that yf he so say, he shall speke very vnlernedly. For be the thynge neuer so false and impossyble to / yet may it be putte and admytted, to consyder therby what wold folow or not folow theruppon, yf yt were both possyble and trew / or els made that great wyse and well lerned man Boetius a very symple and an vnwyse argument, what time to proue that the fredome of mannes wyll is nothing restrayned, nor the fynall effecte of thynges here cōtingent or happenyng, any thynge precysely boūden to ye tone parte or to the tother by the prescyence and forsyght of god, he dyd put the case that god hadde not of any suche thynge to come any forsyght at all. And then dyd theruppon argue thus in effecte, that all were it so y• god dyd not foresee whether such a mā shold in  such a momēt or vndyuisyble tyme, syt or not syt / yet shold that man in that moment do but the tone of those twayne, whyther of the twayne hym selfe then wolde, and shold not in that one tyme vndyuysyble do the both twayn both syt & not syt, wherof the tone were contradyctory & playne repugnaūt to the tother. And that therby may euery man playnly perceyue, that the prescyence of god putteth no necessyte in thynges of theyr nature conuenyent vnto fre wyll of man.
               who so consyder well this argument of his, and many suche other lyke made by many ryght excellent wyse & well lerned men / shall eyther esteme them all for folys / or ellys confesse that vppon frere Barons reason, groūded vppon the dyfference betwene the whole catholyke chyrch in dede,

                   and the generall counsayle that is not the whole chyrche but by way of representacyon, I may well and orderly put the case, and suppose that the whole people were at the generall counsayle. And then in cause yt so were / yf then my purpose wolde folowe / and frere Barons purpose fayle as ye se playnely yt wolde: then is my parte as well proued, and his as well confuted, as yf the matter were not onely for argumēt supposed, but were so comen to passe & so done in very dede. And so this ensample of myne may for all the impossybilyte therof, be a good groūde of profe agaynst all these felowes in theyr false and faynt framed maters, cōcernynge the mayntenaunce of theyr false heresyes, agaynste all the knowen catholyke chyrche, by theyr owne ymagynacyon of a secrete scatered vnknowen chyrche, and yet eche  of them a dyuerse chyrche not one agreynge wyth a noth

               Now hath frere Barons therfore none other shyft that I can se, but to say that in that generall counsayle whyche I haue put and supposed in saynt Gregoryes dayes, the heresyes that I haue spoken of, of Luther, Tyndale, & hym selfe, wolde not haue ben condempned, but rather approued and allowed for good thynges and trew / nor that generall counsayle then beynge suche as I haue put, wold
                     •
                   neuer haue ordeyned that there sholde be any generall counsayle after of any fewer then all the whole chrysten people / or yf there sholde, yet wolde they not haue d

               If frere Barons or any of all his felowes be so bold as to tell vs this / then may they boldely bere vs in hand what so euer they wyll in this worlde. For this maye euery man well wyt, that they wold determine when they were comen to gether, as they all knew to be good and trew whyle they were a sundre. But then are we very sure, wherof I thynke neyther Barns nor, Tyndale nor Luther neyther, can for sham say the cōtrary / but y• vntyll wythin this twenty yere passed laste, all the worlde good and badde, crysten and hethen, wol

               And also that the dew assemble of certayne partes representynge the whole body, sholde haue the full authoryte of the whole body / is a thynge by the comen assent and experyence  of the whole worlde crysten and hethen so fully seen and perceyued, that no mā can doute but that it wold haue be so there determyned, for the power and authoryte of euery generall counsayle of crystendome lawfully called and assembled to gether, yt though they were not as they could not well be after crystendome so greatly encreased the congregacyon of all the whole crysten people, yet sholde theyr det

               And well ye wote that in the fyrste counsayle that the apostles kepte at Hierusalem, they called not all the whole congregacyon of crysten peple to yt, and yet all crysten people obayed yt.
               And where frere Barons sayth that the generall counsayles  be but embassyatours & therfore can not do so mych as ye prynces may them self that send them / I say that prynces geue theyr embassiatours full authoryte in suche thynges as they sende them for to do, as myche as they myghte them self, yf they were there present in theyr owne persons / for elles yf they sent them very farre for maters that requyred spede, they myght as well kepe them at home.
               And where he sayth that men must examine the generall counsayles by the scrypture, 
                     •
                  o se whyther they do w
                     •
                  ll or wronge. I say that the counsayle in the makynge so muste do, and so do in dede, and that the spyryte of god guydeth them therin & ledeth thē into all necessary trouth of fayth. And that when they haue done theyr determinacyon, is not

                   than to be examined by frere Barns, or suche other as lyste to mysse constre the scrypture to the cōtrary to defend theyr false heresyes.
               Now shall I ferther saye, that what so euer all chrysten people wolde determyne yf they came to one assembly togyther / loke what strength it sholde haue yf they so dyd, the same strēgth hath it yf they be all of ye same mynde, though they make no decre therof, nor come not togyther therfore. For whan all chrysten people be by the same spyryte of god brought into a full agreement and consent, that the vowe of chastyte may not be by hys pleasure that made it broken and set at nought, but that who so doth breke it cōmytteth an horryble synne / and that who so holdeth the contrary of thys is an heretyke: than is that bylyefe as sure a trouth  as though they had all the whole company comen to a coū
                  sayle to gyther to determyne it.
               And whan thys is a trewth onys so reueled by god for a perpetuall necessary treuth, and the contrary therof for a peryllouse perpetuall falsshed, and the textys of holy scrypture touchynge that poynte by the holy men so taken and taught, and thorow chrystendome with all men so byleued / than what tyme so euer two or thre begyn vpon theyr own heddys to vary from all the remanaunt, and agaynste all the remanaunt do s

                  yffely holde the contrary, they holde a playne false heresye, and after that as many as fall to theyr opynyon and take theyr parte, be in the lyke perell and in lyke dāpnable heresy, waxe theyr nōber neuer so great. For euer shall they leue the trew knowen chyrche byhynde / whyche  wax it neuer so small a flocke shall yet neuer fayle / but contynue, and as it styll contynueth and alwaye contynue shall in the olde approued trouth, so is it alwaye styll, and alwaye styll shall be the very trewe chyrche of Cryste / and where so euer the same knowen chyrch remayne euery person in euery other parte of the worlde that is chrystened or longeth to be chrystened consenteth with that chyrche in fayth is a member of the same / and thys is what so euer Barns bable the very trewe chyrch, wyth whych the spyryt of god is assystent and wyll not suffer it to fall in to dampnable errour. And that it so is haue I all redy proued in mo places than one, both of thys wurke and myne other, & by mo places than one of open playne scrypture to.

                     wout the world / wherfore how can a man complayn to that chyrche? I answere our mayster Cryste doth playnely speke of a man that hath wronge the whyche must nedes be a partyculare and a certayne man. And therfor lyke wyse he byddeth hym cōplayne not to the vniuersall chyrch but to the ꝑtyculare chirch, now this particular chirch yf she be of god and a trew mēber of the vniuersal chirch she wyll iuge ryghteousely after Christes word & after the ꝓbaciōs brought afore her / neuertheles oftētymes cometh it that this partycular chyrche doth fully and holy erre and iudgeth vnryght and excōmunicateth hym that is blessed of god, as it is open in our owne lawe whose wordes be these. Often ten tymes he that is caste cut is within, and he that is without is kepe within &c Here haue ye playnely that the partycular chyrche maye erre / wherfore that  chyrche that can not erre is alonely the vnyuersall chyrche whiche is called the communion and the felowshyppe of sayntes, the whyche addycyon was made by holy father (for in saynt Cypryans tyme was there no mencyon of it) by all lykelyhed to declare the presumpcyon of certayne men and of certayne congregacyons that rekened them selfe to be the holy chyrche.
               
            
            
               More.
               Here sayth frere Barns .iiii. thynges in thys answere The fyrst is that Cryst doth there playnely speke of a man that hath wronge. The seconde that bycause he that hath wronge muste nedes be a pertycular and a certayne man, therfore god byddeth hym in lyke wyse go complayne not to the vnyuersall chyrche but to the partyculare chyrche.

                   The thyrde is that thys partycular chyrch yf she be of god and a trewe member of the vnyuersall chyrch, than she wyll iudge ryghtuousely after Christes worde, and after the probacyons brought afore her. The fourth is that thys partycular chyrche doth somtyme whole erre.
               Now as touchynge the fyrste poynt / frere Barons here sayth that Cryst spake there of hym that hath wrong done to hym sylfe, as thoughe Cryste ment of no mo, but wolde onely sende hym that had wronge to complayne to the chyrche for his recompense. But me thynketh surely that yf Barons take it thus, he taketh it wronge. For I say yt though Cryste doth not so forbyd the man that is wronged to complayne, that it were alwaye dedely synne for hym to complayne: yet he rather counsayleth hym to bere that wrong  and pacyentely suffer it than to complayne vppon hys brother for it. And therfore I say that Cryst here playnely speketh of euery man that secretely fyndeth hys brother, that is to wytte any other man in any dedely poynt of false bylyefe or synfull lyuyng though the party that fyndeth hym therwyth haue neyther harme therby in body nor goodes nor good name / ye & though he myghte by the man whome he so fyndeth in suche a faute haue great aduauntage temporall, to do no more but wynke therat and fynde no faute therin thys man I say, yf he be good, is for all that offended by hym that suche euyll dothe or sayth / in that for the vnyte of cheryte bytwene all chrysten brothern he can not but be greued wyth hys chrysten brothers euyll.

               Surely yf Barns wordes were trewe than do all these folke an hygh dedely synne, and such a synne as there can of none other come any more hurte I trow. But I am sure hys artycle as hym self reherseth it wyll neuer be defended wyth all that euer he bryngeth for it, nor all yt euer he maye brynge forth bysyde. But lettyng the remanaunt passe tyll some other tyme / hym selfe there reherseth amonge other  thynges that mayster doctour wulman layed agaynst hym these wordes that we be in hand wyth here.

                   is content that they must haue a court for the reprouynge of certayne crymys excepte he be so madde as to mene here that the partye wronged shold no thyng ellys but make some wonderyng vpon hys aduersary in the market place without any court or iudge,
               Now in this hys exposycyon here / he restrayneth it onely to the complaynt of hym that is wronged / and so wyll that

                   no man shall any thynge complayne vnto the chyrche, but onely of his own wronges done vnto hym selfe / where as the order of charyte wolde rather, that a man shall neglecte his owne wronges in the complaynte wherof may be suspycyon of angre or auaryce / and complayne to the chyrche vppon other mennis wronges, wherunto he were lykely to be moued onely of charyte.
               Also what crymes be there wherewyth a man maye be wronged, that the chyrche of god doth not reproue.
               More ouer yf Cryste here speke specyally of hym that is wronged, and specyally byddeth hym go complayne to the chyrche / he semeth to sende hym for the redresse and recompence of his wronges.
               And therfore when all his whole tale of his exposycyon  here, and his answere there is set to gether yt amounteth vnto no more, but that who so euer is wronged by a nother he may lawfully complayne to the spyrituall court, but not to the temporall courte / and why so now? mary sayth Barons bycause that in the spyrytuall courte the partye that offendeth, shall but haue his cryme reproued / but in the temporall courte, he shale fall vnder the temporall sword. Frere Barons meaneth not here I trow, that vppon euery complaynt made and proued in the temporal court, the party that hath wronged his neyghbuor, shall haue his hedde

               But now to our purpose, yf frere Barns restrayne those wordes of Cry
                     •
                  te: If thy brother offende the and wyll not amende, neyther at thy secrete warnynge nor at thy warnynge wyth on

                   or two wytnessys, then fynally complayn vnto the chyrche: yf he restrayne theym thus as he semeth here to do, to such folke onely as haue wronges done vnto them selfe: he doth expowne the place playn wronge, both for the causes afore remembred, and also for that it appereth by the texte that Cryste byddeth hym at the seconde

                   monycyon yf the fyrste auayle not, he shall take to hym one or two wytnesses / meanynge therby that he sholde take no mo then very necessite requyreth for the profe of the mater, yf the wylfulnesse of the party that offendeth do dreue the mater into the open courte. And than was by the law two competent wytnesses suffycyēt for a profe and no fewer.
               Now when Cryste wolde, he sholde take vnto hym as few as he myght, bycause he sholde not vtter his brothers faute vnto any one mo then very nede sholde requyre: yf Cryste hadde spoken those wordis vnto none other but onely hym that were wronged hym selfe, he wolde neuer haue sayde / take vnto the one wytnesse or twayne, but take vnto the twayne alway at the leste. For ellys takyng to hym but one, there sholde haue lakked halfe the profe. For he that dyd the wronge / wold not wytnesse agaynst hym selfe, and  he yt toke the wrong, could not be taken a wytnes for hym self. And so yf Cryst hadde ment no more then Barns sayth here he dyd / Crystes counsayle hadde ben vnsuffycyent for the mater. For his prouysyon myght haue ben obserued & the mater yet reste reproued. But of trouthe our sauyoure lyke as he spake and ment suffycyentely / so his counsayle prouyded suffycyently. For when he bode hym take one witnesse or twayn, and yet ment that he shold take no mo then there neded: the man yt wolde obserue yt to the very poynt, yf the wronge were done properly to hym selfe, he sholde take twayne, lest his complaynt shold be frustrate for lacke of suffycyent profe. And y
                     •
                   the mater pertayned not properly to hym selfe / he shulde take but one, bycause hym selfe myght in that case be the tother.
               
                   And thus good reders as for the fyrste poynte of frere Barons answere, co
                     •
                  cernynge the vnderstādynge of those wordes of Cryste: If thy brother offende the &c. complayn to the chyrche: ye se that frere Barons hath not handeled yt very well. Let vs now to the seconde.
               The seconde poynt is ye wote well, that bycause he that hath wronge muste nedes be a partyculare and a certayne man / therfore god byddeth hym in lyke wyse go and complayne not vnto the vnyuersall chyrche, but to the partyculare chyrche.
               By this yt appereth, that Barns meaneth yt he that is not wronged, is not sent to the partyculare chyrch. Let vs now suppose that a man wolde in a corner go teache a nother

                  e that neyther  thefte nor aduoutry were any synne at all / and that a thyrde man herynge hym and secretly reprouyng hym, and therby fyndynge none amendement, nor by the wytnesses at second y• time beyng called therto, wold folow fayn ye coū
                  sayle of Criste, and therfore asketh Barns whyther he shall for his brothers amendement though hym self be not wronged, cōplayne to the chyrch or not: yt wyll be harde to say nay. Then to whyche chyrche wyll Barns bydde hym go
                     •
                   whyther to the partyculare chyrche or to the vnyuersale. If this man be a partyculare man as well as he that were wronged, and therfore muste complayne to a partyculare chyrche as well as he that were wronged: whereto dothe Barons saye that Cryste speketh playnely of hym that is  wronged / as though he spake of none other, nor as though there were no partyculare man but he that is wronged / but that euery other man not wrōged, were an vnyuersall mā, and must therfore yf he haue any cause of complaynt, go cō
                  playne hym selfe to the vnyuersall chyrche that Barns descrybeth vs, and telleth vs that we can neuer know her nor any member of her.
               The thyrde poynt is very subtyll / and a thynge that yf frere Barons had not sayd yt, I wold neuer haue thought yt possyble / that is that the partyculare chyrch, yf she be of god and a trew member of the vnyuersall chyrche that Barons assygneth, yt is to wyt of onely men pure & clene with out spot or wryncle of synne / she wyll iudge ryghtuousely after the worde of god, and after the probacyons broughte  afore her, who wolde haue went that good men wold haue iudged well and trew men truely?
               The fourth poynt is, that thys partyculare chyrch may all wholy erre.

               And therfore ye may se good reders where about Barns goth, whan he putteth you here a dyfference bytwene the partycular chyrche and the vniuersall chyrche, in that the tone maye erre and the tother can not / and than bryngeth vs in those lawes for the profe, whych lawes do speke of that kynde of errour, in whyche kynde of errour they maye erre partycular and vniuersall bothe.
               ye may playnely perceyue here y• Barns doth but tryfle  in thys great erenest mater and goth about to blere the reders eye with errour happenyng in the examynacyon of an outwarde acte / wherin is to hym that erreth no parell of soule / where hym selfe knoweth well that the errour where vpon all this mater goth is dāpnable errour in doctrine of thynges pertaynynge to the necessary poyntes of fayth, or vertuouse lyuynge. Now where Cryste dyd byd hym that was offended by his brother complayne to the chyrch, frere Barns sayth, that was a partyculare chyrche / who wolde haue went that lo? yf Barns had not tolde vs so, we wolde haue went that Cryste had bode hym complayne to no partyculare chyrch / but go seke yt vnyuersall chyrch whych he could not know though he foūd her / or els tary tyl he could  gete all ye knowē catholyke chyrch to gether vpon a grene.
               But I aske frere Barns whyther Cryste dyd there byd the man so offended complayne to an vnknowen partycular chyrch or to any other particular chyrch than vnto such a partycular chyrche as were a parte of the whole knowen catholyke chyrch? lette frere Barns answere this. Chryste neyther bode hym seke an vnknowen chyrche, nor an vnknowen parte of a chyrche, nor a knowen parte of an vnknowen chyrch / but bode hym well and playnely go complayne to the chyrch / as a thyng that was ethe to perceyue wythout any sophysme or sotletye / for euery man myghte well knowe that he myghte nother complayne to a chyrche vnknowen, nor to all the whole chyrche at onys. But bycause Chryst wold prouyde that all the hole chyrch shold haue one fayth and one trewth of doctryne in rulys of lyuynge & necessary vnderstandyng of the scrypture concernynge

But saynt Austayne sayth not that the chyrche is strengthed in sufferynge of persecucyon for holdynge fals heresyes, for techynge that men be not bounden to faste the lente / but maye eate flesshe on good frydaye / and that the people be no more bounden to come to goddes seruyce on whytsondaye than vpon shroue tuysdaye / on whyche daye though they be boundeu to leue vndone some thinges that many men vse to do / yet are they not so specyally bounden to spende y• day in the dyuyne seruyse as they be the tother  for all Barns bablyng vpon his abiuracyon. Nor the chyrche dyd not suffer persecucyon for techyng that frerys may wedde nones, and breke theyr vowys, & runne in apostasyand set nought by periury, and rayle agaynst all orders of holy relygyouse lyuyng. For in all these thynges is saynte Austayne whom he bryngeth for hym very full and whole agaynste them.

                   amonge your selfe. For saynt Austayne whom he bryngeth for hym dyd after good and longe delyberacyon playnely wryte in thys poynt agaynst hym, as appereth expressely in many of hys pystles wryten bothe vnto the secular powers whom he exhorted agaynste heretykes to represse theym & amende them by force / and also to dyuerse of those heretykes them selfe, wherin he declareth wherfore.
               And yet besyde all thys the chyrche doth in dede abyde & endure the shamefull contumelyes of these wreched heretykes / nor is not ashamed of the contumelyes of the crosse / though these blasphemouse wreches rayle agaynst ye crosse & call it idolatrye to crepe and kylle the crosse / and in some place forbere not to caste the very fylthy myre vppon the crosse.
               
               And yet ferther in some partes of Almayne thys knowē chyrche of Cryste hath many tymes suffered and yet suffereth no lytell persecucyon and very martyrdome / bothe in theyr goodes and landes and theyr bodyes to.
               But yet sayth Barns that thys knowen chyrche can in no wyse be the very chyrche of Cryste / bycause it persecuteth heretykes / & for the profe therof he alledgeth the wordes of saynt Hylary wryten agaynst the Arryans, whyche are these

                  The chyrche doth threten wyth banyshementes and presonmentes, and she compelleth men to byleue her whyche was exiled and caste in preson, nowe hangeth she on the dyghyte of her felowshyppe the whyche was consecrated by the thretenynges of persecuters, she causeth prestes to flye that was encreaced  by the chasyng away of prestes, she gloryeth that she is loued of the world the whyche coulde neuer be Chrystes excepte the worlde dyd hate her &c.

For in these wordes appereth that the catholyke chyrche dyd neuer persecute heretykes by any temporall payne or any secular power vntyll the heretykes began suche vyolence them selfe. For yet in saynte Hylaryes dayes the trewe catholyke chyrche dyd it not.

                   But the Arrianes that were heretikes as ye perceyue here by saynte Hillaries wordes / when they hadde corrupted & goten into theyr secte great prynces, vsed theyr authoryte agaynst the catholikes in bannishemētes and prysonamēt, and myche other cruell handelynge / all whych the good catholyque people suffred & vsed none other defence / sauyng the sworde of the word of god, and the cēsuris of the chirch whyche that holy clergy pronoūced and declared agaynste Arrius and all his adherentes in that holy counsayl holdē at Nece.
               But afterwarde when that secte was by the goodnes of god abated and the right fayth well and fully restored, and concorde, reste, and quyete, growen amonge chrysten people, and that yet agayne after that some heretikes beganne  to rayse a new brabelynge / good prynces remembryng the great harme and vnrestefulnesse that had growne by such heretykes, as had brought vppe sectes and scysmes in the chyrch of Cryste byfore / dyd of theyr own good myndes for the preseruacyon of the peace, prohybyte and forbyd those heresyes vpon certayne paynes and in lyke wyse cōmaunded the bokes of those heretyques to be burned. And all be it that some very good men & holy doctours wold haue ben very gladde to treate and vse those heretyques so tenderly that they sholde haue hadde no bodely harme, in so myche that holy saint Austayne was fyrst of the same mynde hym selfe / yet afterwarde consyderynge the mater betser, he perceyued the cōtrary to be so mych better, and so mych harme  growynge to good men & dyspleasure to god, yf yt so shold contynue, that he letted not in writyng to confesse his own ouersyght, and reuoke his fyrst opynyon, and was not onely cōtente that suche obstynate heretykes as to the trouble of good quyete people / and dysturbynge of the catholyque fayth wyth the parell of many pore symple soules, wolde styrre suche scysmes and heresyes, sholde be by fere refrayned, & byforce repressed, and by payne punyshed: but also requyred by his owne wrytyng the seculare powers ther to / and he thought it a benefyt to the heretyques them selfs to be reduced from theyr errours into the ryght fayth / rather for fayre and payn here temporall, then to perseuere in theyr heresies & fall into ye fyre perpetuall.

               But saynte Austayne was not in this mynde alone, but so was saynt Hierome and many other holy men also. And vnto the same haue by the spyryte of god, for the weale of  crystēdome, all crysten nacyons full and whole agreed / and haue ben by the importune malyce of heretyques raysynge rebellyons in dyuerse regyons dreuen of necessyte to set in sundry tymes, sorer and sorer punyshement therunto. And yet as ye se so strong is the deuyll in theyr obstynate hartes that scantely can all suffyse.
               But yet layeth Barns a nother reason, to proue that the very chyrche of Cryste can not be a knowen chyrche in no wyse. For he sayth that we byleue the very chyrch of Cryst by fayth, and yt is an artycle of oure fayth / and therfore yt is no knowen chyrche, nor can be no knowen chyrche. But that yt muste nedes be a chyrche vnknowen of onely holy people, pure and clene wythout spotte or wryncle / and that the very chyrche muste nedes be suche an holy company so  pure and so clene without spot or wrincle: he proueth thus.

So that yf the chyrche loke on her owne merytes of her own workes, she is full of synne, and muste nedes saye, Dimitte mihi debita, the whyche she neded not to saye yf she hadde none. But yf she referre her selfe vnto the merytes of her blessed husbande Cryste Iesus, and to the clennesse that she hath in his blood / then is she wythout spot.

And therfore sayeth saynt Paule, there ys no damnacyon vnto them that be in Cryste Iesu.
               
            
            
               More.
               I haue good reders somwhat touched the wordes byfore. But now ye se that he sayth that this chyrche hath alway synne in her, and so alway spottes and wryncles. But yet bycause she stykketh faste vnto her husbande Chryste in fayth, and abydeth in confessyon of her synne, and requyreth mercy for them / therfore is there nothynge layed vnto her charge, but all that thynge is forgeuen her, & that therfore she hath neyther spot no wryncle lefte in her. And this he proueth as ye se by saynte Paule sayenge, There is no  dampnacyon vnto them that be in Cryste Iesu.
               I haue sayde vnto Barns byfore and yet I say agayn, yt though Crist hath as saynt Paule saith vnto the Ephesies, gyuen hym self for

                  oule that euery man for whom Criste hath geuen hym selfe to make hym gloryouse, shall in dede be gloryouse: for some wyll forwardely refuse to be made gloryouse. And that company yt shalbe gloryouse, shall yet not be gloryouse here in this world / but shall be here in this world gracyouse, that they may in a nother worlde be gloryouse. And yet not at euery tyme gracyouse in this world neyther / but some tyme fall frowardely or neglygētly from grace, and so stande longe in suche vngracyouse state / and yet thorow goddes callyng on them, tourne agayne wyllyngly  by grace vnto grace / at so passe at the laste thorowe grace into glory. But he may be of Crystes chyrch here many yeres in erth, and happely neyther gracyouse nor gloryouse / and yet he may knowledge his synyes and aske mercy, and byleue euery artycle of the ryght fayth, and trust to be saued to / and yet by wylfull purpose of cōtynuynge in some horrible synnes, stand styll in a dampnable state. And as yt may be that some shall amende and be saued / so may yt be that some wyll neuer amende, but shall therfore be fynally dampned. And yet though he was not one of Cristes electes / yet was he a member of his mystycall body, his catholyque chyrche here in erth, and may byleue in hym, and truste in hym, and knowledge his synne, and aske mercye, and for lacke of good purpose may mysse of mercy to.

               But saynte Poule to reproue Barons false doctryne, sayth not as he reherseth hym, that there is no damnacyon to them that are in Cryste Iesu / but he sayth there is no dā

For saynt Poule sayth playnly yf ye lyue after the fleshe, ye shall dye. And after the fleshe may a mā walke, & after the fleshe may he lyue, & yet do all that frere Barns here sayth in these wordes that the chyrche doth. For he speketh in all these holy wordes of his, nothynge of leuynge the synnefull wayes of the fleshe, or of any such purpose eyther / but to make men wene that no suche thynge neded, but onely byleue, and trust, and knowledge our synne, and a

                   is ours he sayth, as all thynges be cōmune he sayth among frendes / and therfore no dāpnacyon can there be to them that are in such wyse in Cryst Iesu, how so euer they lyue or what so euer they do. And thus may ye se good chrysten people how shamefully thys euyll chrysten man false

               But now is it a worlde to se how he laboreth to cary the reder away from the perceyuynge therof. And yet hath god made Barns hym self so blynd, that ye more blynd he goth about to make the reder, the more he stumbleth vnware vppon the trouth, and taketh it vp & bryngeth it so forth, and also sheweth it to hys owne shame, the most folysshely that I neuer saw the lyke in all my lyfe.

The whole chirch sayth forgyue vs our synnes / wherfore she hath spottes and wryncles. But by knowledgynge, her spottes are weshed awaye. The chyrche abydeth in prayour, that she myghte be clensed by knowledgynge of her synnes. As longe as we lyue here, so standeth it / and when we shall departe out of this body, all such thynges be forgyuen to euery man. wherfore by thys meane, the chyrche of god is in the treasurers of god withoute spotte and wryncles / and therfore here do we not lyue without synne, but we shal

               Now good chrysten readers, here haue you herde frere Barns saye that he wolde reherse you saynt Austayns wordes, to thentent that he wold make you the mater the more playne for hys purpose. But of trouth he hath played in  the rehersyng of theym, as he played in the rehersynge of saynte Poules wordes / that is as ye haue herde, rehersed them falsely wyth pullyng the chyefe parte away, to make them seme the playner for hys purpose. And therfore to the entent that I may make hys false handelyng of saynt Austayn & his fals entent therin appere, as playnely vnto you as I haue all redy made appere vnto you, his lyke handelynge & hys lyke entent in handelynge of saynte Poule: I shall reherse you saint Austayns wordes a lytell more fully & truely than frere Barons hath done / begynnynge where Barns begynneth, but not endyng where he endeth. For he endeth I wote nere where / but maketh two lynys of hys owne, and than endeth wyth &c. as though hys owne wordes were saint Austayns. But thus saith saint Austayn lo.

The chyrch cōtynueth in prayour to be clensed thorow confessyon / and as longe as we here lyue so she contynueth styll, and euery man when he departeth out of hys body, is forgeuen of hys synnys / euery man. I saye of suche maner of synnys as he than had that were venyall. For they be forgyuen also by dayly prayours / and he departeth hense clensed, and the chyrche is layd vp pure golde in to the treasurers of our lorde. And by thys meane the chyrche is in the treasures of our lorde wythout spot and wryncle. And than yf the place where she is without spot or wryncle be there / what thyng shall we pray for whyle we be here? That we may obtayne perdon of our synnys. what good  doth the perdon it taketh out ye spot, and he that forgiueth stretcheth out the wryncle. And where is our wryncle stretched out as it were in the presse or tenter hokes of a stronge fullar? vpon the crosse of Cryst. For euyn vpon the crosse, yt is to wytte vpon that streccher or tenter hokys, he shed out hys bloud for vs. And ye o faythfull people, knowe what wytnesse ye beare vnto the bloud whych ye haue receyued. For of a trueth ye saye Amen. ye knowe what thynge the bloud is which was

               Marke lo how the chyrche is made wythout spotte or wryncle. She is streched out in the strecher or tenter hokys of the crosse, as a chyrch well wesshed & clensed. Now here may euer thys thynge be in doynge. But our lorde doth exhybyte and present vnto hym selfe, a gloryouse chyrch with  out spotte or wryncle there. He goth aboute thys thynge and is in doyng of it euyn here, but he exhybyteth her such there. For man sayth, let vs haue neyther spot nor wryncle. Great is he that goth about it / and he goth aboute it well, and is the cunnyngest wurke man that can be. He strecheth vs out vpon the crosse, and maketh vs smoth wythout any wryncle, whom he had weshed & made clene without spotte He yt came wythout spot & wrincle, was stretched out vpon the strecher or ye tenter hokys. But yt was for our sakes not for hym self, but to make vs wythout any spot or wryncle. Let vs therfore pray him to make vs such / & whē he hath so done, thā to bryng vs to ye shoppys & there lay vs vp where shalbe no pressyng nor strecchyng. Now thou that spakest thus, art thou without spot or wrīcle? what dost thou then

But now though I saye we can not here be wythout synne / we may not commytte manslaughter or  do adultery therfore, or such other dedely synnes as at one stroke sle the soule. For such deades doth not a chrystē man yt hath a good fayth & a good hope / but those synnys onely whych are wyth ye pencell of dayly prayour ouerwyped.
               Now good chrysten readers ye shall fyrste vnderstande, yt where as frere Barns maketh as though saynt Austayn had spoken those wordes agaynst the Donatystys, whych vexed (sayth he) saynt Austayne wyth the same reason that is now layd agaynst hym: he maketh vs two lyes at onys. For neyther dyd the Donatystes vexe saynt Austayn with that reason that is layed agaynst hym, nor saynt Austayne made not that sermō agaynst them. Fyrst as for them, they vexed saynt Austayn wyth this heresy, that they affermed y• very chyrche to be onely in Affryque / and none to be of the  very chyrch but yf he were of the secte of the Donatystes. And now ye wote well no man vexeth frere Barons wyth that heresye. For we saye that the chyrch is the whole nombre of all chrysten nacyons, not beynge by newe heresyes dyuyded from the olde stocke, in what places of the world so euer those people be, and be they neuer so many cūtreys, or be they neuer so few that remayne in the same knowen chyrche, that hath ben by a well knowen successyon preserserued and contynued from Chrystes dayes vnto our own, and in the profession of the same fayth whyche is called the catholyke fayth, bycause it is the faith of the same whole catholyke chyrche. And therfore thys thynge wyth whyche frere Barons is vexed now is not the same wyth whych the Donatystes dyd vexe saynt Austayne.
               
                  Now yf Barns wyll say, that though it be not the same /  it is yet lyke the same, bycause we assygne the chyrche to be in these onely cuntreys in whych it now remayneth / what can we other saye than that for the tyme in whyche it strecheth no ferther, it is but in these cūtreys. But we deny not but yf there be dwellynge amonge Turkes or Sarasyns any chrysten, or men than longe to be chrysten, whych agre with the knowen chyrche of these chrysten contynued nacyons in fayth / all those folke are of thys knowen chyrche also.
               And ouer that whan so euer the same contreys that are vnchrystened nowe, shall here after as I truste onys they shall, bycome chrystened agayne, and be byleuers of the comon catholyke fayth, and so become membres of the comon knowen catholyke chyrch / than say we that there shall  the chyrche be to. But the Donatystes sayd and wold haue semed to proue it by the very scrypture to, that the chyrche sholde not remayne but in Affryque. And therfore the Donatystes vexed not saynte Austayne wyth the same thynge wyth whyche we vexe frere Barns.
               yet yf frere Barns wyll saye that it is lyke, in that that lyke as those heretykes were called Donatystes, so these heretykes call the catholyke chrysten people papystes: yet can it not be lyke for that. For saynt Austayn called the successoure of saynt Peter the chyefe hed in erth of the hole catholyke chyrche, as well as any man doth now. And also frere Barns can not alledge that poynt agaynste vs. For hym selfe ye wote well confesseth that the pope is the vicare of Cryste here vppon erth.
               
               Fynally the questyon that is bytwene frere Barns and vs, is not the same that was bytwene the Donatystes and saynt Austayn. For bytwene Barns and vs, the questyon is whyther the very chyrch be a knowen chyrch of chrysten people good and badde bothe, or an vnknowen chyrche of onely good holy vertuouse people, pure and clene wythout eyther spot or wryncle. And in thys poynt were both saynte Austayne and the Donatystys agreed, that the very chyrche was a chyrche knowen.
               And thus good reders ye may se that frere Barns sayth vntrewe in thys poynt, where he sayth that saynt Austayn was vexed by the Donatystes, wyth the selfe same reason that hym selfe is now vexed wyth vs. But thys he fayneth,

                   make it seme that the knowen catholyque chyrch were now of the same opynyon that those heretyques the Donatistes were then / and that saynt Austayne were of the mynde that hym selfe is now, that the very catholyque chyrche were an vnknowen chyrch, of onely good folke pure and clene with out eyther spotte or wryncle of any maner synne. And he wolde make vs wene, that saynte Austayne therfore wrote those wordꝭ agaynst ye Donatistes, to proue agaynst them that the very chyrche here in erth were an vnknowen chyrche of onely suche holy sayntes as were wythoute any synne.
               But now to proue you that frere Barns maketh vs a ly in that poynt, ye shall vnderstande good reders, that saynt Austayne spake those wordes not agaynst the Donatistes, but agaynste other sectes of heretyques called the Pelagyanys  and the Celestyans.
               And to proue you farther, that frere Barns maketh you therin not onely a lye, but also a very folyshe lye / ye shall se hym conuycted in this poynte, by the very wordes of saynt Austayne hym selfe in the selfe same sermon. For in all that whole sermon is there not onely no worde spoken of Donatystes / but that also he declareth hym selfe by playne and open wordes, to speke those wordes agaynst Pelagyans & the Celestyans, as I sayde byfore. For lo in the very wordes next byfore those, wyth whych frere Barns begynneth / saynt Austayne sayth thus: Vbi es tu heretice Pelograne uel C

               And thus ye se clerely, that saynte Austayne wrote not those wordes agaynste the Donatistes as Barons belyeth  hym / bnt agaynst the Pelagyans and the celestians, as his owne expresse wordes do declare you.
               But now ye wyll peraduēture meruayle, for what entēt frere Barons hath made this false folyshe chaung, in whyche he may be so playnely reproued. ye shall vnderstande good readers, that he dyd yt not for nought, but of a great wylynesse wyth a very lytle wyt.

Fyrste Pelagyans sayde, that euery man myght by his onely naturall strength make hym selfe

And then Celestius added vnto yt, that there is no mā a good man but he that so doth in dede / and that the very chyrche hath none but onely suche good men in yt, whych muste nedes ye wote well be an vnknowē chyrche.

               For where as those heretykes sayd, that the very chyrch hadde none in yt but such as were so clene and so pure that they neyther had spot nor wryncle / saynt Austayne sayeth as ye haue herde, that not onely the meane sorte of the very chyrche, but also all the whole chyrch no nomber therof except, no not the very beste, prayeth in the Pater noster god, to forgeue theym theyr synnes. And therfore sayth he that those heretyques lye, that saye the whole very chyrche here in erthe hath none therof, but onely suche as haue neyther spot nor wryncle of synne.
               And then goeth saynt Austayne farther and sayth that suche as be in the chyrche, and therfore lyue not wyhoute synne, gete forgeuenes by knoweledgynge of theyr synne, and askynge mercy, and by prayour, and with fayth and cō

                  uenes wyth. For then he sayeth that as god hath washed away our spottes wyth the water of baptysme / so he stretcheth out our wryncles vppon his owne crosse.
               And yet he sayth for all this, that no man lyueth here so clene, but that as long as he lyueth here, he so spotteth hym selfe agayn, and so caccheth euer some wryncles, that he lyueth neuer wythout, nor longe can not, not for necessyte of our nature peraduenture, but thorow our wylfull fraylty and neglygence. And then sheweth he farther yet, that in

                   those synnes wythout whyche no man lyueth / he meaneth not abomynable dedely synnes, as māslaughter, or aduoutry, or suche other horryble dedely synnes, as sle the soule at one stroke. For suche synnes crysten men, he sayth, that haue a good fayth and a good hope, wyll not commytte. wherby saynte Austayne teacheth vs agaynst the doctryne of those heretyques and these to, that a man may be a crysten man, and of the very same chyrche to, whyche Cryste hath geuen hym self for to make her fayre & gloryouse / and may haue also a trew fayth, that is to wyt a full bylyefe of euery uecessarye trouth, and a full hope, that is to wytte, a great stronge truste in Cryste to be saued by Criste / and yet not a good fayth able to make the man good, bycause yt is but Barns fayth, that is to witte onely fayth without well  workynge charyte / nor a good hope, bycause it is a presumptuouse hope, lokynge to be saued wyth dampnable deuelyshe leuyuge. And for these causes may the member of the very chyrche here, when he dyeth in such mynde, for all his knowledgynge and askynge mercy to, go from Crystes very chyrche in erthe to the deuyls very chyrche in hell.
               For saynt Austayn sayth here as ye haue herd, that they whyche haue suche synnes as at the tyme of deth sholde be remytted / that is to say that hath not then such as be at his dyenge dedely both for theyr owne nature and for lacke of trew repentaūce, wyth purpose of amendemēt & well vsyng of the sacramentes, shall be fully forgeuen / that is to wyt yf he haue for attaynynge therof, vsed hym selfe suf

               And that saynt Austayne meaneth here none otherwyse then I do declare hym: ye may well perceyue yf ye well aduyse his wordes whych I haue truely trāslated. And yet bycause ye shall the lesse doute therof / saint Austayn shall him self declare y• I truely declare you this place, by his own very playn wordes in a nother place. For in y• .xxxii. sermon of the wordes of y• apostle,
                     Augustinus de verbis Apost serm. 32
                   lo thus he sayth. No man ought to doute, but that wyth prayours of the chyrch and wyth the  holsome sacryfyce, and wyth almoyse that is geuen for the soules of them that are departed, they are holpē to be more mercyfully delt wyth of our lorde, then theyr synnes haue deserued. For this thynge by the tradycyon of the olde fathers, the whole catholyque chyrche obserueth / that ys to wyt, that what tyme they that deceaced in the communyon and blood of Cryste, at the tyme of the sacryfyce in theyre place and order, remēbraunce made of them, pray
                     •
                  ur shold be made for them / and not that onely, but also that specyall rehersall shold then be made, that the same sacryfyce is offerd vp for them to. Now when workes of mercy are done in commendacyon and fauoure of theym / who can doute, but that they are holpen therwyth, syth prayour made for

                   them vnto god is not frutelesse? It is not in any wyse to be dowted, but that these thynges succour & releue them that are deceaced. How be it onely suche men I saye as haue so lyued before theyr deth, that these thynges maye do theym good after theyr deth. For in relyefe of them that be departed out of the body wythout fayth workynge wyth cheryte, 
                     •
                  nd wythout the sacramentes of the same / suche deades of deuocyon are in vayne vsed, the pledge or erneste peny of whyche deuocyon they lacked whyle they lyued here, ether bycause they wold not receyue the grace of god, or bycause they receyued it in vayne, treasurynge and layenge vp for them selues not mercy but wrath. wherfore whē any good worke is done for them that are deceaced by theyr louers and frendes, they meryte not of newe / but these thynges  are gyuen in rewarde, as thynges consequent and well folowynge vppon theyr merytes whyche they deserued before whyle they lyued. For it is not sayd that these thynges shold helpe them onely whyle they here lyue, and not when they are deade.
               And therfore euery man when he endeth thys lyfe, can no thynge receyue, but that onely whyche he hath deserued beynge here a lyue.
               And in another place he sayth thus. what thyng so euer of venyall synnys is not redemed of vs / it must be purged wyth that fyre,

For eyther whyle we lyue in thys worlde, we labour our selfe wyth penaunce / or ellys truely  bycause god so wyll or suffereth it, we are punysshed wyth many trybulacyons for these synnys. And then yf we gyue thankes vnto god, we be delyuered. whyche thynge is a thys wyse / yf oure husbande, or oure wyfe, or oure sonne dye, or yf our substaūce whyche we loue more then we shold do, be taken from vs. For though we loue Chryste aboue that substaunce, so that yf nede were, we wolde rather l

                  se that substaunce than denye Chryste: yet bycause as I haue afore sayd, yf we loue that substaunce more than we shold, and can not whyle we lyue or when we dye lese it wythout greate sorowe, and yet for all that yf when we lese it, we gyue thankes as good chyldren vnto god, whych as a mercyfull father suffereth our substaūce to be taken frō vs / & yf

we wyth very humylyte confesse that we suffer lesse punyshment  than we haue deserued: the synnys be in suche wyse purged in thys worlde, that in the worlde to come the fyre of purgatory can fynde eyther no thynge or ryght lytell to burn
                     •
                  . But then yf we neyther thanke god in our trybulacyon, nor bye out our synnys with good workes / we shal so longe abyde in that fyre of purgatory, tyll the venyall synnys aboue named be consumed vp as wode, hey, and stubblys. But some man wyll saye, I force not how longe I there abyde, so that I maye at the last go to the euerlastyng lyfe. Let no man say thus my moste welbeloued bretherne / for the fyre of purgatory is more sharpe then any payne yt in thys worlde can be sene, or thought or felt. &c.
               Lo good chrysten reders ye maye clerely se by saynt Austayns  wordes here, that he mente not to deny purgatory there / but affermeth it playnely, syth he sayeth there is no dowt but that prayour and almoyse dede, and the oblacyon of that holy sacryfyce offred for them in the masse, maketh the soulys that are departed to be the more mercyfully delt wythall, and theyr paynes to be releued.

Now syth we se what sayth frere Barns: let vs now se what sayth frere saynt Austayne Barns. He sayth ye wote wel, that ye chyrch shal passe hense wythout synne, and that yt is in the treasours of god wythout spot or wryncle / but he sayth y• yt lyueth not here wythoute synne.

               And thus were as Barns sayd in ye begynnyng, that he wold bryng in saynt Austayne to proue his purpose playn: he semeth rather to brynge saynte Austayne in / wyth playn

               But now that he hath so shamfully loste his own chyrch of onely good holy people vnknowen, clene and pure wyth out spot or wryncle: yet that the very chyrche muste nedes be an vnknowen chyrche of onely good holy men at the leste, though somwhat wryncled and not all vtterly spottelesse, and that it can in no wyse be any knowen chyrch / this wyll frere Barns as he weneth well & substancially proue, so that though he proue not his owne that he promyseth, yet wyll he proue that yt can not be oures, but some other  that neyther he nor we be ware of.

                  Suche a chyrch muste there nedes be, though that the carnall yie can not se her, nor the fleshely reason can iudge of her. Wherfore we byleue this artycle by fayth, that holy chyrche is a communyon or felyshyppe of holy men. And we knowe yt not by seynge or felynge, as we do the felyshyppe of drapers or mercers / for then were yt none artycle of the fayth.
               
            
            
               More.
               Nowe let vs argue lyke. A false Iew myght haue sayd in Crystes dayes whyle he preached in Hierusalem: To byleue Cryste must be a artycle of the fayth / ergo Cryste must be a person vnknowen, and not be perceyued by the carnall yie, but onely byleued by fayth, and not by seyng or felyng, as men know a draper or a mercer. Thus myghte in those  dayes a false Iew haue argued, that Cryste hadde not ben very Cryste, bycause he was a knowen person.
               And this argument in a maner made the false Iewes in dede, when they sayde:
                     Iohn̄. 7.
                   we knowe this man whense he is / but when Cryste cometh no man shall know whense he is.
               But as yt myght haue be answered them, that as Criste was both by fayth byleued, and yet was also by syght and felyng knowē, as well as was in such wyse knowē any draper or mercer eyther / for the false Iewes knew hym by the tone meane onely, & his trew discyples knew hym by both / and saynt Thomas of Inde after he hadde both sene hym and felt hym, dyd by syght and felynge know his manhed,
                     Iohan̄. 20
                   and therewyth by fayth byleued his godhed: euen so we

know the chyrche by syghte, herynge, and felynge, as we  know drapers & mercers. And we byleue the spyryt of god abydynge therwyth and ledynge yt into all trouthe,

                     Matth. 16.
                   And we byleue that yt is but one chyrche by professyon of baptysme, holyly dedecated vnto god, and seuered and openly knowē from all the manyfold open sectes of heretyques / as the comen crede sayth that is dayly songē at the masse, we byleue one holy & apostolyke chyrche. whyche worde apostolyque wherfore yt was putte in, frere Barons wyll hym selfe as yt semeth not lette to confesse, though Tyndale wyll not agree yt.
               And we byleue that the communyon and felyshyp of all  suche folke, so halowed and dedycated vnto god, where so euer they be in the worlde, agreynge to gether in the knowē catholyque bylyefe / is the bothe knowen and beleued holy catholyque chyrche of Cryste.
               Also we byleue the communyon of sayntes in a nother maner besydes that / that is to wyt, we byleue that such as lyue here in this chyrche, and in this chyrch also dye in the catholyque fayth and in the state of grace, shall after thys lyfe haue the communyon and felyshyp of the sayntes that are byfore departed into heuen, and that lyued some tyme in this same knowen catholyque chyrche, and dyed in the same knowen catholyque fayth.
               Now yf frere Barons aske me how I proue that these wordes of the crede, sanctam ecclesiam catholicam, be vnderstanden  of the knowen catholyque chyrche: I wyll proue yt by the wordes of saynt Austayne hym selfe, bycause frere Barons beynge professed frere of saint Austaynes order, wold seme to sette mych by hym. Lo these be therfore the wordes of saynte Austayne.

The catholyque chyrch he calleth the chyrch that is spred abrode thorowe out the hole worlde. For the chyrches of heretyques whych be dyuerse, are not called catholyke or vnyuersall chyrches.

For truely she is that onely chyrch, of whyche our lord gladly receyueth sacryfyce / and which onely maye  wythout any dystrust to be herd, make intercessyō for those that are wandered out of the way. For whyche cause also our lorde cōmaunded of the sacryfyce of the pascall lambe sayeng, ye shall eate it in one house onely, and ye shall beare no part of that flesshe forth a dores.

               By these wordes of saynt Austayne, ye se also that frere Barns in hys gay bable, wherwyth he wolde make men by leue that the chyrche can not be the chyrche but yf it suffre persecucyon, and that no man myghte come to heuen nor be a trewe chrysten man, but yf he were persecuted: here lo good reders, besydes that it is a greate persecucyon vnto the chyrche, and a ryghte greate gryefe and heuynesse, to se so many of her membres waxe so roten and fall away from

her body, by the incurable canker of these false fe

                  tered heresyes  / and that it is also sore persecuted bothe in body and goodes by these false heretyques, in dyuers partes of Almayne / yet se you ferther here in the fore rehersed wordes, the thynge that I tolde you before / that as for persecucyon it suffyseth to suffre it whā it is of necessyte put vnto them / and men neyther bounden to go seke it, nor so to suffer euyl folke amonge them selfe, that the contagyon of a few maye corrupte a great many. whyche growen onys in great nomber, may fall vnto rebellyon and persecute all the cuntrey. For saynt Austayn sheweth here well and clerely, that with out persecucyon, yf we haue as wolde god we had, so plentuousely as our parte were to haue, such good cherytable wurkes wyth the catholyke fayth, as hym selfe reherseth / we may be good chrysten men and membres / not onely of  the very chyrche here in erth (whyche we maye be by communyon of fayth though good wurkes want) but also of ye very chyrche in heuen.
               More ouer good chrysten readers, ye se that saynt Austayne in these wordes, doth playnely shew that the sayntes whyche are all redy in heuen, do praye for vs that are here in erthe / whyche thynge these heretyques wyll in no wyse agre.
               Here se you also that these wordes sanctam ecclaesiam catholicā, by whyche frere Barns wolde make vs wene that the holy catholyke chyrche were a secrete vnknowen chyrche scatered about the worlde / sayn

               But now that I haue playnely confuted frere Barons by saynte Austayne hym selfe, whose order and rule frere Barns professed, and whose wordes he so often alledgeth for hys purpose alwaye prouynge agaynste hys purpose: I wyll now for frere Barns ferther wurshyp, confute hym by the selfe same place of saynt Austayne, whyche hym selfe bryngeth here forth for hys specyall profe of hys vnknowē holy chyrch, to proue it a company of vnknowen faythfull folke beynge holy by theyr onely fayth / wherof these ar

                      in god. And thē frere Barns goth forth with his own glose vpon these wordes and sayth / Heare you not the cause wherfore the chyrche is holy? bycause she byleueth ryghtuousely in god / that is, she byleueth nothynge but in hym, and she byleueth nor heareth no worde but hys / as our mayster Cryste bereth wytnesse: My shepe heare my voyce, and a nother mannys voyce do they not knowe.

                   that is to wyt by heretyques, whyche be straungers from the housholde of Crystes catholyque chyrche, and whyche do straungely  reherse and straungly declare Crystes catholyke scripture, agaynste the knowen catholyke doctryne of Crystes knowen catholyque chyrche, by the voyce of such straūgers, that is to wyt by the voyce of suche heretyques, Chrystes shepe can not heare theyre owne shepeherde Cryste. And therfore they fle from euery suche straunger, accordynge as saynte Poule whose voyce Cristes shepe do heare, bycause he was a nother and not a straūger, sayth vn Crystes flocke,

               And thus ye se good readers, how fere Barns here false fyeth and wronge interpreteth the wordes of Cryste in the gospell of saynte Iohn̄.
               But now let vs retourne to consyder the wordes of that lawe that Barons hath here rehersed you / from whyche I

haue ben as ye se a lytle letted by this other false poynte of  his in false rehersynge the scrypture.
               But now concernynge that law good reders / you shall vnderstande that the wordes of that law be taken out of a sermone of saynte Austayne, whyche he made vnto certayn persons forthwyth vppon theyr baptysme. In whyche sermone amonge many other thynges that he preached vnto them, both in the same and other two sermons that he had made them byfore / he sayth vnto them thus: where as we haue asked eche of you, Byleuest thou in holy chyrche, remyssyon of synnes, and resurreccyon of the flesh: we asked you not after that maner, that you sholde euen in the same maner as you byleue in god, byleue in the catholyque holy chyrche / whyche chyrche is therfore holy and catholyque, bycause yt byleueth ryght in god. And therfore we sayde it not, to thentent that ye sholde byleue in the chyrche as ye sholde byleue in god / but vnderstand you that we byd you and dyd bydde you, that beynge conuersaunt in the holy catholyque chyrche, you sholde byleue in god, and that you sholde byleue also the resurreccyon of the fleshe that ys to come.
               Lo good crysten reders, here haue you herde that in the selfe place where as saynt Austayne sayth that the chyrche is holy and catholyque, bycause yt byleueth ryghte in god, bycause none of all the sectes of heretyques can be holy nor catholyque, that is to saye vnyuersall / syth very holynesse can none be out of the ryght chyrch, nor god shall suffer no secte of heresye to sprede ouer all the worlde so as he sprede  the vnyuersall chyrche: in the selfe same place I say saynte Austayne declareth, that by these wordes, I byleue in the holy catholyque chyrche, is not ment that we shall byleue therin as we byleue in god / but that that we must byleuing one holy catholyque chyrche, abyde and be conuersaunt in the same one holy catholyque chyrche / and byleuynge in god, contynue in that one holy catholyque chyrche, and not go out therof into any of so many folde dyuerse sectes of he retyques. By whyche ye may playnely perceyue that saynt Austayn ther declareth the holy catholyque chyrche of the ryght bylyefe, to be y• comen one vnyuersall knowen chyrch dystyncte and dyuyded from all the knowen chyrches of heretyques. For yf yt were vnknowē, how shold he byd them by that exposycion of that artycle, abyde and be conuersaūt

                   in yt? or how could he as he sayth a litle also byfore in same sermon, as is also rehersed in the same law, say that the ceremonyes vsed in the baptisme were instituted by the same catholyque chyrche? For yf yt were vnknowen, how could yt any thyng instytute or ordayne?
               And fynally to put out of all doute & question, that saynt Austayn obhorreth from frere Barns heresy, that argueth vppon that artycle of the crede, that the chyrche sholde be an vnknowen chyrche / saynte Austayne sayeth playnely as I shewed you byfore agaynst Tyndale, that lykewise as he were accursed that wolde saye that Cryste was not a man knowen, so accursed be he that sayeth the chyrche of Cryste is not a chyrche knowen.
               Lo thus are we now good cristen reders comen vnto an  ende of frere Barons chyrche, in whych ye playnely se that he can neyther agre wyth Tyndales vnknowen chyrche of repentaunte synners, nor impugne the comen knowen catholyke chyrch of Cryste, nor proue his own secrete chyrch of onely sayntes vnknowen. Nor he hath not alledged as ye se well also, neyther any one texte of holy scrypture, nor any sentence of holy doctour / but falsefyenge them and framynge them a freshe after his owne fashyon / yet haue they not onely nothynge proued for hym, but in conclusyon clerely proued agaynst hym.
               And therfore wyll I (to ende where Barns endeth hym selfe) let you somwhat se how he handeleth saynt Bernard, and there wythall fynyshe this boke.

And of those goodes cometh the harlottes deckyng that thou seest dayly, the game players dysgysynge, and kynges apperrell.

yf he haue twayne, whyle he serueth the tone, he shall leue  the tother vnserued. And therfore though saynt Bernarde saye that they serue Antechryste, and that they serue the deuyll yf he had sayed also, and therfore they be no seruaūtes of Cryste, nor be no chrysten menne but Chrystes enemyes & very antechrystes: yet had he not ment in all thys, yt they were for all thys oute of the chyrche, and none of it whyle they were such, and than of it agayn whan they were amē
                  ded, and out of it agayn as soone as they synned agayne / & thus playe in and out, lyke in docke, out netle, that no man sholde wyt whan they were in and whan they were out, nor knowe whych were the chyrche.
               Thus haue I shewed you good reders, that all though saynt Bernard had sayd in dede as Barns falsely reherseth  him, ye & somwhat more to / yet had it not ꝓued for Barns.
               Now for the secunde poynt, ye shall vnderstand that Barons hath vntruely translated you saynt Bernardes wordes. For lettynge passe some peces that he hath lefte out in the myddes, for no cause that I cā se but yf it were for lacke of lernynge, and lettynge passe some suche also as he hath mysse translated of ignoraunce: I wyll shewe you but one place or twayne, whyche he hath wyth one word or twayne so chaunged of malyce, that he hath turned the sentence for hys purpose clene agaynste the mynde of saynte Bernarde that wrote it. For euyn in the very fyrst begynnynge where saynt Bernarde sayth thus: Ministri Christi sunt & seruiunt Antichristo / that is, They be the mynystres of Cryste & they serue Antichryst: Barns hath translated it thus, They call them selfe  the mynistres of Cryst, but they serue Antichrist. So that where saynte Bernard sayth, that though they serue Antichryste yet they be the mynystres of Cryst in hys chyrche here / frere Barns turneth that an other way, & maketh as though saynt Bernarde sayd not that they be so, but sayd onely that they call them selfe so. And in lyke wyse after in the ende, where as saint Bernard sayth, pro huiusmodi volūt esse, & sunt ecclesiarū 
                     ppositi
                   / that is, For such thynges as these be wyll they be rulers of chyrches, and so they be, as deanys, archdekyns &c. Barns hath translated it thus, For such thinges as these be, wyll they be rulers of the chyrch, dekyns, archdekyns &c. And these wordes, so they be / he leueth out, as though saīt Bernard sayd not y• they were any rulers in the chyrch, but onely sayth yt they wold be so.
               And than whan he hath in suche wyse falsely translated saynt Bernarde to make hym seme to saye so / than he lyeth

                   out alowd, & sayth vnto them hym selfe, Lo saynt Bernarde saith that you be neyther the chyrche nor of the chyrch. wherof as ye se saynt Bernarde sayeth by playne wordes the contrary / whych playne wordes of saynt Berua
                     •
                  de frere Barns hath as ye playnely se, of playne & pure malyce manyfestely & falsely chaūged. And who so euer yt is lerned & rede ye same sermō of saynt Bernard, shall there euydentely se that saynt Bernarde calleth the very chyrche of Cryst, the comune knowē catholyke chyrche, and none vnknowen chyrche. For he lamenteth there the estate of the chyrche, whyche he calleth also there the body of Cryste / wherby ye maye se that he speketh of the very chyrche of Cryste in erthe.
               Now than sheweth he there that thys chyrche hath bene in dyuerse tymes dyuersely vexed / fyrste by paynyms that  were neuer of it / secundely by heretykes whyche were of it and went out of it / and thyrdely by noughty folke and euyl rulers that be of it styll and go not out, of whome he sayth those wordes that Barons hathe falsely translated / and fourthly by very good men therof also, whyche abydynge therin and beynge also styll therof, be yet somtyme begyled by the subtyll slayght of ye most wyly deuyll, vnder colour of goynge about some farre better thynge. And thys processe of those .iiii. vexacyons of the chyrche, saynt Bernarde there bryngeth in vppon these wordes of the prophete. A tim

By all whyche whole processe together, who so be lerned and rede  it shall se Barns heresye concernynge the very chyrch, very full and playne ouerthrowen. For there shall he playnely se, that saynt Bernarde whom Barns here bryngeth in to proue that euyll folke be none of the very chyrche of Cryst, but onely good holy folke / declare there expressely, that the very chyrche of Cryste whyche he calleth there the body of Cryste / is the whole nomber of both good and bad, dyuers of lyuynge and yet one in bylyefe / out of whych one chyrch all the chyrches of heretykes be departed.
               Now where as Barns also sayth, that saynt Bernarde calleth all the holy ornamentes harlattes deckyng, & game players dysguysynge, as though saynt Barnarde dyd as hym selfe doth,

                   wryteth vnto Hildefonsus the erle of Tolowse agaynste one Henry an apostata, runne out of relygyon, and corruptynge the cuntrey wyth many suche poysened heresyes as these apostatas do now. And to thentēt that ye may the better and the more fully perceyue the goodnes of saint Bernarde in thys mater, and hys frutefull labour & payne taken to the honour of god and profyte of chrysten people, and by god agaynewarde wyth many great open myracles alowed and approued agaynst the sayd Henry frere Barns double brother, that is to wytte as well in heresye as in apostasy: I shall reherse you somwhat of the mater out of the story, that was by a very vertuouse holy man, in the same tyme that the thynge was done, wryten in the lyfe of saynt

                   Bernard. In the partes of Tolouse, one whose name was Henry, some tyme a mōke, and after that a lewd apostata, of a very vngracious lyuynge, and pernycyouse doctryne, by his persuasyble wordes hadde tourned the wauerynge people of that countrey / and as thapostell foresayde of certayne folke, he lyued in hypocrysye, and lyed, and made merchaundyse of them by false fayned wordes. For he was a manyfeste enymy of the chyrche, derogatynge vnreuerētly bothe the holy sacramentes and mynysters of the same. And he hadde now preuayled very myche in his malyce. For as our reuerent father saint Bernard wrytyng of hym to the prynce of Tolouse, amonges other thynges sayeth: euery where almoste where he went, men myght fynde the chyrches wythout people, people wythout prestes, prestes wythoute dewe reuerence, & fynally chrysten men wythout  Cryste.
               The lyfe of Cryst was shyt frō the babys of crystē folke, whyle the grace of baptysme was denyed. Prayours were mocke at, and the oblacyons for mennys soules, prayenge to sayntes, the sentēce of excōmunycacyon, the pylgrimage of faythfull folke, the byeldynge of chyrches, the sparynge from bodely worke on the holy dayes, the consecratynge of the holy creme & oyle, and fynally all maner ordinaunces of the chyrche, were set at nought. In this necessyte this holy man often therunto instantely requyred by the crystē folke of that countrey, at the laste toke his iournay / persuaded and brought therunto, by the most reuerente father in god Albericus byshoppe of Hostyens, and legate of the see apostolyque. And when he came thyther, he was receyued of  the people there wyth an incredyble deuocyon, as though an angell had comen downe vnto theym from heuen. Nor longe myght he not tary wyth them, for that no man was able to kepe bakke the thronge of the people from hym / so great was the multytude of theym that came to hym dayly and nyghtly, callyng vppon hym for his blessynge and his helpe. yet preached he certayne dayes in the cytye of Tolouse, and in all suche other places as that wreche most had haunted and moste greuousely hadde infected many a symple soule in the fayth, in those places saynte Bernarde instructed and strengthed them that were wauerynge
                     •
                   reuokynge theym that erred, settynge vppe agayne those that were ouerthrowen ouer throwynge and kepynge vnder by

his anthoryte, the subuerters, and all those that were obstynate  / all whome he ouerthrewe and repressed in suche wyse, that they neyther durste resyste, nor so myche as appere and shewe them selfe. How be yt though that heretyke was then fled, and hadde hyd hym selfe / yet were his ways in suche wyse stopped, and his patthes so byset, that scant
                     •
                   he coulde after lurke sure in any place / and was at the last taken and faste bounde and brought to the byshoppe.
               In this iourney of saynt Bernarde, god was in his said seruaūt gloryfyed by many myracles, whyle he called bak the hartes of some from theyr wycked errours, and some also cured from dyuerse diseases of theyr bodyes.
               There is a place in the same countrey, called Sarlate, where after his sermon fynyshed, they brought many louis  of brede to the seruaunt of god (as the custome was euery where) to be halowed / whyche louys of brede he lyft vppe his hande, and in the name of god blessed theym wyth the sygne of the crosse, and sayde vnto the people: by this shall ye knowe that the thynges whych we tell you be trew, and the thynges whyche these heretyques tell you be false / yf ye se that your syke folke after that y• haue tasted of this brede be cured. Then the reuerent father the byshoppe of Carnotenses, that great famouse man byshoppe Galfryde (for he was ther present and nexte the man of god) somwhat ferenge leste that myracle of curynge shold not fall vpon euery syke man that sholde eate of that brede, sayde vnto the peple: Those syke folke shall fynde helpe that eate of this brede with a good fayth. But then saint Bernard nothyng  doutynge of the powre of our lorde answered, That is not the thynge that I wolde haue sayde / but that veryly who so euer taste therof shall be cured, to thentent they may therby know that we be trewe, and the very trewe messangers of god.
               So great a nomber of syke people, by the tastynge of that same brede recouered, that the tydynges thereof was publyshed through out all the prouynce / so that that holy man retournynge by the places nere there aboute, was for the intolerable concurse of people fayne to turne out of his waye, and tered to go thyther.
               Now good crysten reders, here may ye perceue that holy saynte Bernard
                     •
                  , wyth whose wordes frere Barons as though saynt Bernard were his specyall patrone, so proudly

                   maketh an ende of all his peuyshe processe, is so full, so open and so playne agaynst hym in all his whole heresyes, that a man wolde meruayle where frere Barns wytte was when he brought hym in. For fyrste we haue sene that the very wordes of saynt Bernarde whyche Barns bryngeth, newe framed by hym selfe, and falsely forged for his owne auauntage, do playnly make agaynst his purpose that he bryngeth them for. And now ye se farther here, that saynt Bernarde also was very enymy to Barons all other heresyes / and not onely dyd preache agaynst the selfe same heresyes that Barons nowe setteth forth, but dyd also proue them false, and the fayth of the catholyque chyrch trew, by manyfolde open myracles. And fynally where Barons reproueth the chyrch for persecutyng of heretykes: ye se that  holy saynt Bernarde whome Barns so specyally bryngeth in for his parte, dyd playnely pursew theym, and laboured for theyr punyshement hym selfe.
               And farther haue I shewed you, that saynt Bernard in the selfe same processe out of whych frere Barns hath pycked and falsefyeth those few wordes that he bryngeth / doth playnely to frere Barons confusyon in his pryncypall purpose of the chyrche, declare & make open that the very trew chyrche of Cryste his mystycall bodye here in erth, is no secrete vnknowen chyrche, as frere Barons goth aboute to make yt seme / but is oute of all questyon, this one comen well knowen catholyke chyrche of all crysten nacyons, as I byfore haue specyfyed, left to gether in the stocke of vnite of the knowen catholyque fayth, dystyncte and dyuyded  from all the manyfolde wythered braunches of so many soundry scysmys and sectes, as from the begynnyng vnto these wreched dayes haue wyth obstynate malyce wylfully fallen therfro.
               And in this wyse good crysten reders here ende I thys boke agaynste frere Barons euyll and vncrysten processe / wherwyth agaynste the promyse of Cryste,

                   the deuyll and he labour in vayne to pull downe Crystes chyrche.
            
            Thus endeth the .viii. boke.
