of repentaunce, made by
Iohn Bradforde.
            
               Luke. xiii.
               Excepte you repent you ſhall all
lykewyſe peryſhe.
            
            
               Apoc. ii.
               Remembre whence thou arte
fallen, and repent thee.
            
         
         
            
            
            ¶To the Chriſtian reader,
Iohn Bradforde wyſſheth the
true knowledge and peace of Ieſus Chriſt,
oure alone and omniſufficiente
ſauiour.
            
               GReat and heauie
is Goddes anger agaynſt
vs, as the moſte greuous
plague of the death of our
late kynge (a prince of all
that euer was ſithen chriſtes
aſcention into heauen
in anye region pereles)
nowe fallen vpon vs, doth pronoſticate. For
when Goddes iudgemente hath begonne wyth
his chylde thus oure deare dearlynge, let othermen
thynke as they can, I ſurelye cannot be perſwaded
otherwyſe, but that a greuous and bytter
cuppe of Goddes vengeaunce is readye to be
powred oute for vs Englyſhmen to drynke of.
The whelpe God hath beaton to fraye the bandogge.1. Pe. ii
                     ••
                  
               
Iudgement is begonne at Gods houſe.
In Goddes mercye to hym wardes he is taken
awaye, that his eyes ſhulde not ſee, the miſeries
we ſhall fele:Heb. xi. he was to good to tarrye with vs
ſo wycked, ſo frowarde, ſo peruerſe, ſo obſtinate,
ſo malicious, ſo hypocriticall, ſo couetous, vncleane,
vntrue, prowde, carnall. &c, a generation.
I wyll not goe about to paynte vs oute in oure
coulours. All the worlde which neuer ſaw Englande,
by heare ſaye ſeeth England. God by his
plagues and vengeaunce I feare me wyll paynt

vs oute, and poynte vs oute▪ we haue ſo mocked
with hym and his Goſpell, that we ſhall feele it
is no bourdyng wt him. Of longe tyme we haue
couered our couetouſnes & carnalitie, vnder the
cloke of his Goſpell, ſo that all men ſhall ſee vs
to oure ſhame▪ when he ſhall take his Goſpell awaye,
and geue it to a people that wyll brynge
forth the frutes of it, then ſhal we appeare as we
be. To let his Goſpell tary with vs, he can not,
for we deſpyſe it, contempne it, are glutted with
it, we diſdayne his Manna, it is but a vyle meat
thynke we: we woulde be agayne in Egypt, and
ſyt by the greaſy fleſhe pottes, to eate agayne our
garlike, onions, and leekes. Sithen Gods goſpell
came amongeſt vs, we ſaye now we had neuer
plentye,Ie. x
                     •
                  iiij therefore agayne let vs goe and worſhyp
the quene of heauen.Hie. vij. Chyldren begynne togather
ſtickes, the fathers kyndle the fyer, and ye
wemen make the cakes to offer to the quene of
heauen, and to prouoke the lorde to anger. The
earth can not abyde now the wordes & ſermous
of Amos:Am. vij. the cauſe of all rebellion is Amos and
his preaching,Act. xvij It is Paul and his felowes, that
makes all out of order. Summa, the Goſpell is
nowe 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
the outcaſte and curſe of the realme: and
ſo are the preachers, therfore out of the doores wt
them. So that I ſaye, God can not let his Goſpel
tary wt vs, but muſt nedes take it away to do
vs ſome pleaſure therein, for ſo ſhall we thynke
for a tyme:Gen. xix. as the Sodomitanes thought when
Lot departed from them,Gen. vi. as the old world thought
when Noe crept into his arcke: as the Iero
ſolomytances thought when the apoſtles wente
thence to Peltis. Thē were they mery, thē was

all paſtyme:Ex. xxxij. When Moyſes was abſente, then
went they to eatynge and drynkynge, and roſe agayne
to playe. Then was al peace, al was wel,
nothynge amyſſe. But alas, ſodenlye came the
floude and drowned them, the fyer and burnte
them vp, Titus and beſieged them, Gods wrath
waxed hote agaynſt them. Then was weale awaye,
mournynge and woe: then was cryenge
out, wringing of handes, renting of clothes, ſobbyng
and ſighynge for the miſeries fallen, out of
the whiche they coulde not ſcape. But oh you
morners & cryers out: ye renters of clothes, why
mourne you: what is the cauſe of your myſery?
The Goſpell is gone, goddes word is lytle preached,
you were not diſquieted with it? Noe troubleth
you not, Lot is departed, the apoſtles are
gone? what now is ye cauſe of theſe your miſeries?
Wyll you at y• length confeſſe it is your ſinnes?
Naye now it is to late. God called vpō you
and you would not heare hym, therfore yell and
crye out now, for he wyl not heare you: You bowed
your eares from hearyng of Gods law, therfore
your prayer is execrable. But to come again
to vs Engliſhmen, I fear me I ſay, for oure vnthankfulnes
ſake, for our impietie and wickednes,
as God hath taken awaye our kinge, ſo wil
he take awaye his goſpel: yea ſo we would haue
it, then ſhoulde all be well thinke manye. Wel, if
he take that awaye, for a tyme perchance we ſhal
be quyet, but at length we ſhall fele the want to
our woe, at length he wyll haue at vs, as at Sodome,
at Ieruſalem▪ and other places. And now
he begineth to brew ſuch a brewing, wherin one
of vs is like to deſtroy an other, & ſo make an opē
gappe for forren enemies to deuoure vs, and deſtroy
vs. The father is againſt the ſonne, ye brother

agaynſte the brother. And lorde wt what cō
               ſcience?
Oh be thou merciful voto vs, & in thyne
anger remember thy mercy, ſuffre thy ſelfe to be
intreated, be reconciled vnto vs, naye reconcyle
vs vnto the. Oh thou god of iuſtice, iudge iuſtly
oh thou ſonne of God which cameſt to deſtroy ye
workes of Sathan,
                  
                     •
                   Ioh. iij deſtroye his furoures nowe
ſmokinge, and almooſte ſette on fyre in this
real me. We haue ſynned, we haue ſinned, & therfore
art thou angrye. Oh be not angrye for euer.
Geue vs peace, peace, peace, in the lorde, Set vs
to warre againſt ſynne, againſt Sathan, againſt
our carnall deſyres, and geue vs the vyctory this
waye. This victorye we obtayn by fayth. This
fayth is not without repentaunce, as hir gentleman
vſſher before hyr. Before hir. I ſay in diſcernynge
true fayth from falſe fayth, lyppe fayth,
Engliſhmens fayth: for els it ſprynges oute
of true fayth. This vſſher then of repentaunce, if
we trulye poſſeſſed, we ſhoulde be certayne of
true fayth, and ſo aſſured of the victorye ouer
death, hell, and Sathan: his workes then which
he hath ſtyrred vp, woulde quayle: God woulde
reſtore vs politike peace, ryght ſhould be right &
haue ryght, Gods Goſpel ſhould tarry with vs,
religion ſhuld be cheriſhed, ſuperſtition ſuppreſſed,
and ſo we yet ſomethynge happye, notwithſtandynge
the great loſſe of our moſte graciouſe
liege ſoueraygne Lorde. All theſe woulde come
to paſſe you ſee, yf the gentleman vſſher I ſpake
of, I meane repentaunce, were at ynne with vs.
As if he be abſēt, we may be certayn ye lady faith
is abſent, wherfore we cā not but be vanquiſhed
of the world, the fleſh, and the deuyll, and ſo will
Sathans workes proſper though not in al thinges,
to bleare our eyes, yet in that thinge which

the moſt of all deſyreth. Therfore to repentaunce
for our ſelues priuatelye, and for the realme and
churche publikely eueryone ſhoulde laboure to
ſtyrre vp both oure ſelues & others. This, to the
ende, that for my parte I myghte helpe, I haue
preſently put forth a ſermon of repētaunce, whiche
hath lyen by me halfe a yeare at the leaſte, for
the moſt parte of it. For the laſte ſommer as I
was abroade preachynge in the countreye, my
chaunce was to make a ſermon of repentaunce
the whiche was earneſtlye of diuerſe deſyred
of me, that I ſhoulde geue it them written
or els put it forth in prynt. The whiche thynge
to graunte, as I coulde not (for I had not wrytten
it) ſo I told them that had ſo earneſtlye deſired
it. But when no naye woulde ſerue, but I
muſte promyſe them to wryte it as I coulde: I
conſented to their requeſte that they ſhuld haue
it at my leaſure. This leaſure I prolonged ſo
longe, that as I wene I offended them, ſo didde
I pleaſe my ſelfe, as one more gladde to reade
other mennes wrytynges, then in ſuche ſorte to
publyſhe my wrytynges for other men to reade,
not that I wolde others not to profyt by me: but
that I knowing how ſhort my ſuppellex & ſtore
as, woulde be loth for the enemies to haue iuſte
occaſion of euyll ſpeakynge and wreſtinge that
whiche ſymplye is ſpoken. But when I conſydered
this preſent tyme, to occaſion men now to
loke vpon all thinges in ſuche ſorte as myghte
moue them to Godlynes, rather then to anye curiouſe
queſtioninge, I for the ſatiſfienge of my
promyſe, and profytinge of the ſimple ignoraunt
and rude, haue nowe cauſed this Sermon to be
prynted, the which I beſeche God for his Chriſtes
ſake, to vſe as a meane whereby of his mercy

it maye pleaſe hym to worke in me and manye
others true hartye repentaunce for oure ſynnes,
to the glorye of hys name. Thus fare thou
well in the Lorde. The. xij. of Iulie.

            ¶A ſermon of repentaunce
made by Iohn Bradforde.
            
               THe lyfe we haue
at this preſent, is
the gyft of God,
in whom we liue
moue, and are,
Actes. xvii. and
therefore is he called Iehouah,
Exod iii. for the whiche lyfe, as
we ſhoulde be thankefull, ſo we
may not in any wyſe, vſe it after
our owne fantacie, but to thende
for the whiche it is geuen & lente
vs, that is, to the ſettynge forth
of Gods prayſe and glory, by repentaunce,
conuerſion, and obedience
to his good wyl, and holy
lawes, wherevnto his longe ſufferynge
doeth (as it were) euen
drawe vs, yf our hartes by impenitency
were not hardned. And
therfore our lyfe in the ſcripture

is called a walkynge, for that as
the body dayly draweth more &
more▪ neare his ende, that is the
earth: euen ſo our ſoul draweth
dayly more and more, neare the
death, that is: ſaluation or dampnation,
heauen or hell. Of which
thinge, in that we are mooſt careleſſe,
and very foles (for we alas,
are the ſame to day, we were yeſterday,
and not better or nearer
to God, but rather nearer to hel,
Sathan, and perdition, beynge
couetouſe, idle, carnal, ſecure, necligēt,
proud, &c.) I think my labour
cannot be better beſtowed,
then with the Baptiſt, Chriſt Ieſus,
and his Apoſtels, to harp on
this ſtringe, whiche of all other
is mooſte neceſſarye, and that in
theſe dayes moſt ſpecially. What
ſtrynge is that ſayeth one? Forſoth
brother the ſtryng of repentaunce

ye whiche Chriſt our ſauiour
did vſe fyrſt in his miniſtery,
and as his miniſter at this preſent
I wyll vſe vnto you all.
            Repent, for the kingedome of heauen is at
hande. Math. iiij.
            This ſentence thus pronounced,
and preached by our ſauiour
Ieſus Chriſte, as it doeth commaund
vs to repent, ſo to the doinge
of the ſame, it ſheweth vs a
ſufficient cauſe to ſturre vs vppe
therevnto, namelye, for that the
kyngdome of heauen (which is a
kyngedome of all ioye, peace, ryches,
power, and pleaſure) is at
hande, to al ſuch as do ſo, that is,
as do repente. So that the meanynge
hereof is, as thoughe our
ſauiour myght thus ſpeake preſently:
Syrs, for that I ſe you al
walkynge the wronge way, euen
to Sathan and vnto hell fyre, by

folowynge the kyngedome of
Sathan, whiche nowe is coloured
vnder the pylled pleaſures
of this lyfe, and folyſhnes of the
fleſhe, moſte ſubtelly to your vtter
vndoynge, and deſtruction:
Beholde and marke well what
I ſaye vnto you: The kingdome
of heauen that is another maner
of ioye and felicitie, honoure, and
riches, power, and pleaſure, then
you nowe perceyue or enioye, is
euen at hande, and at youre backes,
as yf you wyll turne agayn,
that is, repent you, you ſhal moſt
truely and pleaſauntlye fele, ſee,
and enherit: Turne agayne therfore
I ſay, that is: repent, for this
ioye I ſpeake of, euen the kyngdome
of heauen, is at hande.
            Here we maye note fyrſte the
corruption of our nature, in that
to this commaundement, repent

you, he addeth a cauſe, for ye kingdome
of heauen is at hande: for
by reaſon of the corruption and
ſturdines of our nature, God vnto
all his commaundementes,
commonlye eyther addeth ſome
promiſe to prouoke vs to obedience,
or elles ſome ſuche ſufficient
cauſe, as cannot but tickle vs
vp to hartie labourynge, for the
doynge of the ſame: as here to
the commaundement of doynge
penaunce, he addeth this aitiologie
or cauſe, ſayinge: for the king
dome of heauen is at hande.
            Agayne in that he ioyneth to the
commaundemente, the cauſe,
ſayinge: for the kyngedome of
heauē is at hand: we may learne
that of the kyngedome of heauē,
none (to whom the miniſterye of
preaching doth appertayne) can
be partaker, but ſuch as repente

and do pennaunce.
            Therfore dearly beloued, yf
you regarde the kyngedome of
heauen, in that you cannot entre
therein except you repent, I beſech
you al of euery eſtate as you
woulde your owne weale, to repent
and do penaunce, the which
thinge that you maye do, I wyll
do my beſte now to helpe you by
gods grace.
            But fyrſt becauſe we cannot
well tell what repentaunce is,
thorowe ignoraunce, & for lacke
of knoweledge, and falſe teachynge,
I wyll (to begynne with
all, ſhewe you what repentaunce
is.
            Repentaunce or pennaunce is
no Englyſhe worde, but we borowe
it of the Latiniſtes, to
whome pennaunce is a forethinkynge
in Englyſhe, in Greke, a

beynge wyſe afterwardes, in Hebrewe,
a conuerſion or turnyng,
the whyche conuerſion or turnynge,
in that it can not be true
and hartye vnto God eſpecially,
without ſome good hope or truſt
of pardone for that whyche is
all readye doone and paſte, I
maye well in thys ſorte defyne
it, namelye, that pennaunce is a
ſorrowynge or forethynkynge
of oure ſynnes paſte, an earneſte
purpoſe to amende, or turnynge
to GOD, with a truſte of pardone.
            This diffinicion maye be
deuyded into three partes, that
pennaunce or repentaunce ſhuld
contayne, fyrſt a ſorowynge for
our ſynues: Secondlye a truſte
of pardonne, whyche otherwyſe
maye be called a perſwaſion

of Gods mercy, by the merits of
Chriſte, for the forgeueneſſe of
our ſynnes: And thyrdely apurpoſe
to amende, or conuerſion to
a newe lyfe: the whiche thyrd or
laſt part, cannot be called properly
a parte, for it is but an effect of
pennaunce, as towards the ende
you ſhall ſe by Gods grace. But
leaſt ſuche as ſeke for occaſion to
ſpeake euill, ſhoulde haue any occaſion,
though thei tarry not out
the ende of this ſermon: I there
fore deuyde penaunce into the
iii foreſayde partes, of ſorowing
for oure ſynne, of good hoope or
truſte of pardon, and of a newe
lyfe. Thus you now ſe what penaunce
is, a ſorowyng for ſynne,
a purpoſe to amend, with a good
hope or truſte of pardone.
            This pennaunce not onely differeth
from that whiche men comonlye

haue taken to be pennaunce,
in ſaying and doing our
enioyned lady pſalters, Seuen
Pſalmes, faſtinges, pilgrimages
almoſe dedes, and ſuch lyke thinges:
but also frome that whiche
the more learned haue declared
to conſiſt of three partes, namely
Contricion, Confeſſion and Satiſfaction.
            Contricion they call a iuſte &
a full ſorowe for theyr ſynne, for
this worde, iuſt, and ful, is one of
the differences betwene contricion
and attricion.
            Confeſſion they cal a numbring
of all theyr ſynnes in the eare of
theyr ghoſtly father: for as (ſaye
they) a iudge cānot abſolue with
out knoweledge of the cauſe or
matter, ſo cannot the Preiſte or
goſtly father abſolue from other
ſynnes, then thoſe whiche he

doth heare.
            Satiſfaction they call a mendes
makinge vnto God for their
ſynnes, by theyr vndue workes,
opera indebita, workes more thē
they nede to do, as they terme
them. This is theyr pennaunce
whiche they preache, wryte, and
alowe: but howe true this geare
is, howe it agreeth with goddes
worde, howe it is to be alowed,
taught, preached, and wrytten,
let vs a lyttell conſidre. If a man
repent not vntyl he haue a iuſt &
full ſorowynge for his ſynnes
(dearly beloued) when ſhall he repent?
for inaſmuche as hell fier,
and the poniſhment of the deuils
is a iuſte ponyſhmente for ſynne:
Inaſmuch as in al ſynne, ther is
a contempt of GOD, whyche
is all goodneſſe, and therefore
there is a deſerte of all ylneſſe:

Alaſſe who can bear or feele this
iuſte ſorowe, this full ſorowe for
our ſinnes, this their contrition,
whiche they ſo do diſcerne from
theyr attricion? Shall not man
by this doctryne rather diſpayre
then come by repentaunce?
            Yf a manne repent not vntyll he
haue made confeſſyon of all hys
ſynnes, in the eare of hys gooſtlye
father: yf a man can not haue
abſolution of his ſynnes, vntyll
hys ſinnes be tolde by tale and
nūber, in the preiſts eare, in that
as Dauyd ſayethe, none canne
vnderſtande, moche leſſe then
vtter al hys ſynnes.Pſa. xix 
               Delicta quis
intelligit,
               Pſalm xxxviij. Who can vnderſtande
his ſinnes? in that Dauid of him
ſelfe complayneth (elſe where,)
howe that thys ſynnes are ouer
flowed his head, and as a heauye

burthen do depreſſe hym: halaſſe
ſhall not a man by this doctryne
be vtterlye dryuen from repentaunce?
Thoughe they haue
gone aboute ſomethyng to make
plaiſters for theyr ſoores, of confeſſion,
or attricion, to aſwage
this geare, biddinge a manne to
hope well of his contricion, thoughe
it be not ſo ful, as is required
and of his confeſſion, thoughe he
haue not nombred all his ſinnes,
yf ſo be that he do ſo muche as in
hym lyeth: Dearelye beloued in
that there is none but that herein
he is gyltye (for who doth as
muche as he maye) trowe ye that
this playſter is not lyke ſalte for
ſore eyes? Yes vndoubtedlye
when they haue al done they can
for the appeaſing of conſciences
in theſe pointes, this is the ſome
that we yet ſhulde hope well.
            
               
But yet ſo hope that we muſte
ſtonde in a mammeryng & doubtynge,
whether oure ſynnes be
forgeuen. For to beleue remiſsionem
peccatorum, that is to be certeyne
of forgeuenes of ſinnes, as
oure crede teacheth vs, they coūt
it a preſumptiō. Oh abhomination,
and that not only hereat, but
at all theyr pennaunce as they
paynte it.
            As concerninge Satiſfaction
by theyr opera indebita, vndewe
workes, that is by ſuche workes
as they nede not to doo, but of
theyr owne voluntaryneſſe, and
wylfulneſſe (wylfulneſſe in dede)
who ſeeth not monſtruous abhomination,
blaſphemie, and euen
open fyghtynge agaynſte God.
For yf Satiſfaction can be done
by man, then Chriſt died in vaine
for him that ſo ſatiſfieth, and ſo

reyngneth he in vayn, is he a byſſhoppe
and a Prieſte in vayne.
            Goddes lawe requyreth loue to
God with all oure harte,Den. vi ſoule,mat. xxij 
power,Mar. xx myght, and ſtrenghte, ſo
that there is nothynge canne be
done to Godwarde,Luke. x. whiche is
not conteined in this commaundemente,
nothynge can be done
ouer, and aboue this.
            Againe Chriſt requireth that
to manward we ſhould loue one
another,Ioh. xiij as he loued vs. Trowe
that we can do any good thynge
to oure neyghbourwarde, which
is not herein compriſed?
            Yea, let them tell me when
they do any thynge ſo in the loue
of God and theyr neyghboure,
but that they had nede to crye,Mat. vi
               Demitte nobis debita nostra.
            
            Forgeue vs oure ſinnes, ſo farre
are we of, from ſatiſfieng, doeth

not Chriſte ſaye,Lu. xvij. when you haue
done all thinges that I haue cō
               maunded
you, ſay that ye be but
vnprofitable ſeruaūtes? Put no
thinge to my worde,Ap. xxij. ſayeth god.
yes,De. iiij. xij. workes of ſupererogation,
ſuperabhomination ſaye they.
Whatſoeuer thinges are true
ſayeth the apoſtle S. Paul. Philip.
iiij. whatſoeuer thinges are
honeſte, whatſoeuer thinges are
pure, whatſoeuer thynges are
conueniente, whatſoeuer thinges
are of honeſt report, yf there
be any vertue, yf there be anye
prayſe, haue you them in youre
minde and do them, & the god of
peace ſhalbe with you. I weene
this well looked on, wyll pull vs
from popiſh ſatiſfactory workes
whiche do deface Chriſtes treaſures
and ſatiſfaction.
            
               
In heauen and in earth was
there none founde that coulde
ſatiſfy gods angre for our ſinnes
or get heauen for man, but only
ye ſonne of God Ieſus Chriſt, the
Lyon of the tribe of Iuda, who
by his bloude hath wrought the
worke of ſatiſfaction, and alonelye
is worthy all honour, glorye,
and prayſe, for he hath opened
the boke with the ſeuen ſeales,
Apoca. v.
            Dearely beloued, therfore abhorre
this abhomination, euē to
thinke that there is any other ſatiſfaction
to Godward for ſinne,
then Chriſtes bloude onely: blaſphemye
it is, and that horriblye
to thynke otherwyſe.
            The bloud of Chriſt purifieth
(ſayeth S. Iohn) from al ſinne,Apo▪ xiii
and therfore he is called ye lambe
ſlayne from the begynninge of

the world, becauſe there was neuer
ſynne forgeuen of God, nor
ſhalbe from the begynninge vnto
the ende of the worlde, but only
thorowe Chriſtes death, prate
the pope & his prelates as pleaſe
them, with theyr pardons, purgatories,
purgations, place bois,
trentales, diriges, workes of ſupererogations,
ſuperabhominations.
&c.
            Eſay. xliii. I am he ſayeth the
Lorde, whiche put awaye thyne
offences, and that for mine owne
ſake, and wyl no more remembre
thyne iniquities: putte me
in remembraunce (for we wyll
reaſon together) & tell me what
thou haſt for thee, to make thee
ryghtuous. Thy fyrſte father offended
ſore. &c. And thus writeth
S. Iohn,1. Ioh. ij. Yf any man ſynne
we haue an aduocate ſayth he

with the father, euē Ieſus chriſt
the ryghtuous, and he is the propiciation
or ſatiſfaction for oure
ſynnes: As in the .iiii. chapter, he
ſayeth, that God hath ſente hys
Sonne to be a propiciation or
meane, for the takynge awaye of
our ſynnes, accordynge to that
whiche Paule wryteth. Heb. ii.
where he calleth Chriſt, a mercifull
and faythful prieſte, to purge
the peoples ſynnes, ſo that blind
buſſardes, and peruerſe papiſtes
they bee, whiche yet wyll prate
our merits or workes, to ſatiſfy
for our ſinnes in part or in whole
before baptiſme or after. For to omyt
the teſtimonies I broughte
out of Iohn and Paule, whiche
the blinde cannot but ſee: I pray
you remember the texte oute of
Eſaye, whych euen nowe I rehearſed,
beynge ſpoken to ſuche

as were thē the people of God, &
had ben a long time, but yet were
fallen into greuous ſinnes after
theyr adoption into the number
of gods chyldrē, it is for my own
ſake ſayth God, that I put away
thy ſinnes. Wher is your partig
of the ſtake now? if it be for gods
owne ſake, yf Chriſt be the propitiation,
thē recant, except you
wyll become ydolaters, making
your workes God, and Chriſte?
Saye as Dauid teacheth: not
to vs lorde, not to vs, but to thy
name be the glorye.
            And it is to be noted that God
doth caſt in their teeth, euen the
ſynne of theyr fyrſte father,
leaſte they ſhoulde thinke that
yet perchaunce, for the ryghtuouſnes
and goodnes of theyr
good fathers, theyr ſynnes
myghte be the ſooner pardoned,

and ſo god accept theyr workes.
Yf they had made ſatiſfaction for
that whiche is done to the congregation
publikely by ſome notable
puniſhmēt, as in the primatyue
church was vſed to open offenders,
ſparkles wherof & ſome
traces yet remayne, whē ſuch as
haue ſynned in adultry go about
the church with a taper in theyr
ſhyrtes. Or yf they had made ſatiſfaction
for reſtitution to manward
of ſuche goodes as wrong
fully is gotten, ye which true pennaunce
cannot be without: Or yf
by ſatiſfaction they had mente a
newe lyfe to make amendes to
the congregation thereby, as by
theyr euyll lyfe they dyd offende
the congregation, in which ſence
the apoſtle ſemeth to take that
whiche he wryteth .ii. Cor. vii.
where tholde interpretoure calleth

               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                ſatiſfaction, whiche
rather ſignifieth a defence or anſwerynge
agayne: yf I ſay, they
had taken ſatiſfactiō any of theſe
wayes, then they had done well,
ſo that the ſatiſfaction to God
had bene left alonely to Chriſte.
            Agayne, yf they had made confeſſion
eyther for that whiche is
to god pryuately, either for that
whiche is to the congregation
publikelye, either for that which
is a free conſultation, with ſome
one learned in gods booke, and
appoynted therunto as fyrſte it
was vſed, and I wyſh were now
vſed amongeſt vs, ether for that
whiche is a reconciliacion one to
another, it had ben ſomethynge:
yea if they had made it for fayth,
becauſe it is a trewe demonſtration
of fayth, as in Paul we may
ſe to the Romaynes the .x. and

to the Hebrews, when he calleth
Chriſte the captayne of our confeſſion,
that is of our fayth. And
ſo confeſſours were called in the
prymitiue churche, ſuche as man
fully dyd wytneſſe theyr fayth,
with the parell of theyr lyues: yf
I ſaye they hadde taken it thus,
then hadde they doone ryghte
well.
            And ſo contricion, yf they had
lefte out theyr ſubtyll diſtinction
betwene it and attricion by this
worde iuſt or full, makynge it a
hartye ſorowe for theyr ſynnes,
then we woulde neuer haue cryed
oute agaynſt them therfore.
For we ſay pennaunce hath thre
partes, contricion, yf you vnderſtande
it, for a hartye ſorrowyng
for ſynne. Confeſſyon, yf you vnderſtonde
it for fayth of free pardonne
in Goddes mercye by Ieſus

Chriſte. And ſatiſfaction yf
you vnderſtande it not to Godwardes
(for that onely to Chriſt
muſte be lefte alone) but to manwarde
in reſtitucion of goodes,
wrongefully or fraudulently gotten,
of name hindred by our ſclaū
               ders,
and in newenes of lyfe: althoughe
as I ſayde before, and
anone wyll ſhewe more playnely
by gods grace, that this laſte is
no parte of pennaunce in deede,
but a playne effecte or fruyte of
true pennaunce.
            I mighte here brynge in examples
of theyr pennaunce, how
perilous it is to be embraced,
but lette the example of theyr
graunde ſier Iudas ſerue, in
whome we ſee all the partes of
their pennaunce, as they deſcribe
it, and yet notwithſtanding was

he damned. He was ſory enough
as the effect ſhewed, he had their
contricion fully oute of the whiche
he confeſſed his faute ſaying:
I haue betrayed innocent bloud
and therevnto he made ſatiſfaction,
reſtorynge the money he had
receyued. But yet all was but
loſt, he hanged vp hym ſelfe, hys
bowelles burſte out, and he remayneth
a chyld of perdition for
euer. I wold wiſhe that this example
of Iudas, in whome you
ſee the parts of theyr pennaunce
contricion, confeſſion, and ſatiſfaction,
woulde moue them to pennaunce,
and to deſcribe it a lytell
better, makynge hope or truſt of
Gods free mercy a pece thereof,
or elles with Iudas they wyll
marre all.
            Perchaunce theſe wordes, cō
               tricion,
confeſſion, and Satiſfaction

were vſed as I haue expoū
               ded
them at the firſt. But in that
we ſee ſo muche daunger & hurt
by vſynge them without expoſitions,
either let vs ioyne to them
open expoſitions alwayes: or elles
let vs not vſe them at all, but
ſaye as I wryte, that pennaunce
is a hartye ſorow for our ſinnes,
a good hope or truſte of pardone
thorough Chriſte, whiche is not
withoute an earneſte purpoſe to
amende, or a new lyfe. This pennaunce
is the thynges whereto
all the ſcripture calleth vs, this
pennaunce do I nowe cal you al
vnto, this muſte be continuallye
in vs, and not for a lent ſeaſon, as
we haue thoughte, This muſte
increaſe dayly more and more in
vs, withoute this we cannot be
ſaued.
            Searche therfore your harts

all, all ſwearers, blaſphemers, lyars,
flatterers, baudye or ydle
talkers, geſters, bribers, couetouſe,
dronckardes, glottonnes,
whoremongers, theues, murtherers,
ſlaunderers, ydle lyuers,
necligente in theyr vocation. &c,
All ſuche and al other as lament
not theyr ſynnes, as hope not
in Goddes mercy for pardon, as
purpoſe not hartely to amende,
to leaue theyr ſwearinge, dronkenneſſe,
ſhhoredome, couetouſneſſe,
ydelneſſe, &c. all ſuche I ſay
ſhall not, nor cannot entre into
Goddes kyngedome, but hell fyer
is prepared for them, wepinge
and gnaſſhinge of teethe,
wherevnto alaſſe I feare me verye
manye will needes goo, in
that verye manye wilbe as they
haue bene, lette us euen to the
wearynge of oure toungue to

the ſtompes, preache and praye
neuer ſo muche to the contrarye,
and that euen in the bowelles of
Ieſus Chriſte, as nowe I beſech
you all, all, all, and euerye mothers
chylde, to repente and lamente
youre ſynne, to truſte in
Gods mercy, and to amend your
lyues.
            Now me thinks you are ſome
what aſtonnied, whereby I
gather that preſentlye you deſyer
this repentaunce, that is,
this ſorowe, good hope, and newneſſe
of lyfe: the whiche that you
maye the rather attaine and get
to youre comfortes, as I haue
goone aboute to be a meane to
ſturre vp (by Goedes grace) this
deſiae of repētaunce, ſo throughe
the ſame grace of God, wyll I
go aboute now to ſhew you, how
you may haue your deſier in this

behalfe. And fyrſte concernynge
this part, namely ſorow for your
ſynnes and hartye lamentynge
of the ſame.
            For this (yf you deſier the hauynge
of it) you muſte beware
that you thinke not that of your
ſelues, or of your owne free wyll,
by any meanes you cā get it, you
may eaſely deceaue your ſelues,
and mocke your ſelues, thinking
more of your ſelues then is ſemelye.
            Al good thynges, and not peces
of good thinges, but all good
thinges (ſayeth S. Iames commeth
from God ye father of light.Iam. i.
If therefore pennaunce be good
(as it is good) then the partes of
it be good. From God therefore
do they come, and not of our free
wyll. It is the Lorde that mortifieth,
i. Reg. ij that bringeth downe, that

humbleth ſayth the ſcripture in
ſundrye places. After thou haddeſt
ſtriken my thigh ſayeth Ieremye,
Hie. xxxi I was aſhamed▪ Lo he
ſayth, after thou haddeſt ſtriken
me: and therfore praieth he euen
the laſt wordes almooſt he writeth:
Turne vs lord and we ſhal
be turned,Lam. v. the whiche thing Dauyd
doth very often. Wherfore,
fyrſt of all, yf thou wouldeſt haue
this parte of pennaunce, as for
the whole (becauſe it is goddes
gyft.Actes. v Acte. xi. ii, Timo. ii. ſo for
this parte, go thou vnto God, &
make ſome lyttel prayer, as thou
canſt vnto his mercy for the ſame
in this or lyke ſorte.
            Mercifull father of our ſauioure
Ieſus Chriſte, bcauſe I
haue ſynned and done wickedly,
and thorowe thy goodnes haue
receaued a deſire of repentaunce

whereto this longe ſufferaunce
doth draw my hard heart. I beſech
thy mercy in Chriſt to work
the ſame repentaunce in me: & by
thy ſpyryt, power, and grace, to
humble, mortifye, and feare my
conſcyence for my ſynnes to ſaluation,
that in thy tyme thou
mayeſte comforte and quycken
me, thoroughe Ieſus Chriſt thy
dearly beloued ſonne. Amē. After
this ſort I ſay, or otherwyſe,
as thou thynkeſte good, yf thou
wylte haue this fyrſt parte, contricion,
or ſorowe for thy ſynnes,
do thou begge it of God, thorow
Chriſte. And when thou haſte
aſked it, as I haue laboured to
dryue the frome truſtynge in
thy ſelfe, ſo nowe I gooe aboute
to moue thee from flatterynge
of thy ſelfe, from ſluggyſhnes

and negligence, to be
diligente to vſe theſe meanes folowynge.
            Vnto prayer which I would
thou ſhouldeſt fyrſt vſe as thou
canſt: Secondly, get thee Gods
lawe as a glaſſe to toote in, for in
it, and by it commeth the trewe
knowledge of ſynne, withoute
whiche knoweledge there can be
no ſorowe. For howe can a man
ſorrowe for his ſynnes, whyche
knoweth not his ſynnes? As
when a man is ſycke, the fyrſte
ſteppe to health, is to knowe his
ſyckeneſſe, euen ſo to ſaluation
the fyrſte ſteppe thereto, is to
knowe thy dampnation due for
thy ſynnes.
            The lawe of God therefore
muſte be gotten, and well tooted
in, that is, we muſte looke in it

ſpirituallye, and not corporallye
or carnally as the outward word
or letter doth declare and vtter,
and ſo our ſauioure teacheth vs
in the .v. of Math, expoundinge
the .vi. and .vii. commaundementes,
not onely after the outward
dede, but alſo after the hearte,
makynge there the anger of the
hart a kynd of murther, luſtinge
after an other mans wyfe, a kind
of adulterye.
            And this is one of the differences
betwene Gods lawe and
mannes lawe. That of this
(mannes lawe I meane) I am
not condempnable, ſo longe as I
obſerue outwardely the ſame.
            But Goddes lawe goeth to
the roote, and to the harte, condempnynge
me for the inwarde
mocion, althoughe outwardlye
I lyue moſte holely. As for example.

Yf I kyll no man, though
in my heart I hate: mans law cō
               dempneth
me not: but otherwiſe
doeth gods law: And why, for it
ſeeth the fountayne whence the
euyl doeth ſpring, If hatred wer
taken out of the hearte, loftineſſe
in lookes, detraction in tonge, &
murther by hand, could neuer enſue.
Yf luſtinge were out of the
heart, curioſitie in countenaunce
wantōnes in wordes, thē baudie
boldneſſe, in body would not appeare.
In that therfore this outwarde
euyll ſpringes out of the
inward corrupcion: ſeynge gods
lawe alſo is a lawe of libertie, as
ſayth S. Iames:Iam. ij. And ſpirituall
as ſayth S. Paul:Ro. vij. Perfectly and
ſpiritually, it is to be vnderſtand,
yf we wyll truelye come to the
knowledge of our ſynnes. For of
this inwarde corruption, reaſon

knoweth but litle or nothinge:Ro. vij. I
had not knowē ſayth Paul, ye luſting
(which to reaſon, & to them
which are gyded only by reaſō, is
thoughte but a trifle) I had not
knowen ſayth he, this luſting to
haue been ſinne, yf ye law had not
ſayd Non concupiſces, thou ſhalt
not luſt.
            To the knowledge therfore of
our ſinne (wtout which we cānot
repent or be ſory for our ſinne) let
vs ſecondly gette gods law as a
glaſſe to toote in: & that not only
litterally, outwardly, or partely,
but alſo ſpiritually, inwardlye, &
throughly: let vs cōſidre the hart
& ſo ſhall we ſee the foule ſpottes
we are ſtayned withal, at leaſt inwardly,
De tempore Barlarico 
                     〈◊〉
                  . wherby we ye rather may
be moued to harti ſorow & ſighīg
For as ſ. Auſten ſayth it is a glas
which feareth no bodie: but euen
loke what a one part ſo it paintes

the oute. In the law we ſee it is
a foule ſpot not to loue the Lord
our God wtal (al I ſay) our heart
ſoule, power, might & ſtrength, &
that cōtinually, In the law it is a
foule ſpotte, not onely to make to
our ſelues any grauen ymage or
ſimilitude, to bow therto. &c, but
alſo not to frame our ſelfes wholly
after the ymage wherto we ar
made not to bow to it, to worſhip
it. In the law we ſe yt it is a foule
ſpot, not only to take gods name
in vain: but alſo not earneſtli, hartely,
& euen cōtinually to call vpō
his name only, to geue thākes vnto
him, to beleue, to publiſhe, & to
liue his holy word. In gods law
we ſe it is a foule ſpot to our ſoules,
not only to be an opē prophaner
of ye ſaboth day: but alſo not to
reſt frō our own words & works
yt ye lord might both ſpeake & wor

vs, & by vs: not to heare his holy
worde: not to communicate hys
Sacramentes, not to geue occaſion
to others to holynes, by our
example in godlye workes & reuerēt
eſteminge of the miniſterie
of his worde.
            In Gods law we ſee it a foule
ſpot to our ſoules not only to be
an opē diſobeyer of our parents,
magiſtrates, mayſters, and ſuch
as be in anye auctoritie ouer vs:
but alſo not to honour ſuch, euen
in our heartes, not to geue thā
               kes
to God for them, not to pray
for them to ayde, to helpe, or releue
them, to beare with their infirmities.
&c. In Gods lawe we
ſee it a foule ſpotte in our ſoules
not onelye to be a manqueller in
hatered, malyce, proude lookes,
bragges, backbiting, raylinge, or
bodely ſlaughter: but alſo no to

loue oure neyghbours, yea oure
enemies, euen in our hartes, and
to declare ye ſame in al our ieſture
wordes and workes. In Gods
law we ſee it a foule ſpot to oure
ſoules, not onelye to be a whoremonger
in luſting in our heartes
in wanton loking, in vncleane or
wanton talking, in actuall doing
vnhoneſtly with out neyghbors
wife, daughter, ſeruaunt. &c. but
alſo not to be chaſt, ſobre, temperate
in heart, lokes, tonge, apparell,
deedes, and to helpe others
there vnto accordinglye. &c. In
Gods law we ſee it is a ſoule ſpot
to our ſoules, not onely in hearte
to couet, in loke, or worde, to flatter,
lye, colour, &c, in dede to take
away any thing whiche pertayneth
to another: but alſo in heart
countenaūce, word & dede, not to
kepe, ſaue, and defend that which

pertayneth to thy neyghbour as
thou wouldeſt thine own.
            In Gods law we maye ſee it a
foule ſpot, not only to lie, or beare
falſe witnes agaynſt any mā but
alſo not to haue as greate care
ouer thy neyghboures name, as
ouer thine owne. Sinne in gods
law it is (we may ſe) & a foule ſpot
not only to conſent to euil, luſt, or
carnal deſyres, but euē the verye
natural or carnal luſtes & deſires
thēſelues, for ſo I may cal thē natural
it ſelf, beyng now ſo corrupted
as ſelf loue, & many ſuch like,
by reaſon wherof, I trow ther is
none▪ that toteth well herein, but
though he be blameles to ye world
& fayre to ye ſhew, yet certaynely
inwardly, his face is foule araied
& ſo ſhamful ſaucie māgie, pocked
& ſkabbed, yt he cānot, but be ſory,
at the cōtēplaciō therof: & that ſo
much more by how much he continueth

to loke in this glas accordingly.
And thus much cōcernīg
the ſecōd mean to ye ſtirring vp of
ſorowe for our ſinne: yt next vnto
praier, we ſhuld tote in gods law
ſpiritually: yt which toting yf we
vſe wt praier (as I ſaid) let vs not
doubt, but at ye lēgth, gods ſpirit
wil worke, as now to ſuch as beleue,
(for to ye vnbeleuers al is in
vayn: Their eyes ar ſtarke blind
they can ſee nothing) to ſuche as
beleue (I ſay) I truſt ſomthing is
done euē already. But yf nether
by praier nor by tooting in Gods
law ſpiritually, as yet thy harde
vnbeleuing hart fealeth no ſorow
nor lamēting for thy ſinne: Thirdly
loke vpon ye tagge tied to gods
law, for as to mās lawes, there is
a tagge tied, yt is a penaltie. So
is there to Goddes lawe a tagge
tyed, that is a penaltie: and that
no ſmall one, but ſuche a greate

great one, as cānot, but make vs
to caſt our curriſh tayles betwen
our legges, yf we beleue it, for all
is in vayne, yf we be faythles not
to beleue, before we feele.
            This tage is Gods maledictiō
or curſſe,Gal. iij. 
               maledictus omnis (ſayth
it) qui nō permanet in omnibus quae
ſcripta ſunt in libro legis ut faciat
eam, Loe, accurſed (ſaith he) is al
no acception, al ſayth God which
continueth not, in al thinges (for
he that is giltie of one is giltie of
the whole layeth S. Iames) In
all thinges therefore, (ſayeth the
holy ghoſt) which are written in
the boke of the lawe to do them:
he ſayeth not to heare them, to
talke of them, to diſpute of them,
but to doe them.
            Who is he now that doth theſe?
Rara auis, fewe ſuch byrdes, yea

none at all. For all are gone oute
of the way, though not outwardlye
by word or dede, yet inwardly
at the leaſt, by defaulte & wantinge
of that which is requyred:
ſo that a chylde of one nightes
age is not pure, but (by reaſon of
byrth ſinne) in daunger of Gods
malediction. Moch more thē we
which halas haue dronken in iniquitie
as it were water,Iob. xv. as Iob
ſayeth: but yet halas we quake
not. Tell me nowe good brother
why do you ſo lightely conſyder
Gods curſſe, that for your ſinnes
paſt you are ſo careles as though
you had made a couenaunt with
death and damnatiō as the wicked
dyd in Eſayes time? what is
Gods curſſe? At the popes curſſe
with boke, bell, & candle, oh howe
trembled we, which harde it but
onely, though the ſame was not

dyrected vnto vs, but vnto others,
but to this Goddes curſſe,
which is incōparably, more fell, &
importable, & is directed, yea hā
               ging
ouer vs al, by reaſon of our
ſinnes, halas how careles ar we?
Oh faythles hard harts.Apoc. iij. Oh Iezabels
geſtes, rocked and layd a
ſlepe in her bed, Oh wicked wretches,
whiche being come into the
depe of ſinne do cōtēpne theſame,
Oh ſorowles ſinners & ſhameles
ſhrinking harlots, Is not the anger
of a kinge death? and is ye anger
of the king of al kinges a matter
to be ſo lightlye regarded, as
we doe regard it, which (for our
ſinnes) are ſo recheles yt we ſlug
& ſlepe it oute? As waxe melteth
away at the heate of ye fyre (ſaith
Dauid) ſo do the wicked periſhe,
at the face or countenaūce of the
Lord: Yf dearly beloued his face
be ſo terrible, and intollerable for

ſinners, & ye wicked: What trowe
we his hand is? At the face or apearing
of gods anger, the earth
trembleth: but we earth, earth,
yea ſtones, yron, flintes, trēble no
thinge at al? yf we wil not trēble
in hearinge, wo vnto vs for then
ſhal we be craſſhed a peces in feelinge:
yf a lyon rore the beaſtes
quake, but we are worſſe thē beaſtes,
which quake nothing at the
roring of the lion, I meane ye lord
of hoſtes. And why? becauſe the
curſſe of God, hardenes of heart,
Chreno. iij, is already fallē vpon
vs, or els we could not but lamēt
& trēble for our ſynnes, yf not for
the ſhame and foulenes thereof:
yet at the leaſt for the maledictiō
and curſſe of God, which hāgeth
ouer vs for our ſynnes.
            Lorde be mercyfull vnto vs
for thy Chriſtes ſake, and ſpare

vs in thyne anger, remembre thy
mercy towardes vs. Amen.
            And thus much for the thyrde
thing to the mouing of vs to ſorow
for oure ſinnes (that is for ye
tagge tied to Gods law, I mean
for the malediction and curſſe of
God.
            But yf our heartes be ſo hard
that thorow theſe we yet fele not
harty ſorow for our ſynnes: Let
vs fourthlye ſet before vs examples
paſt, and preſent, old & new:
that therby the holy ſpirite may
be effectual to worke in his time,
this worke of ſorowing for oure
ſinne.
            Loke vpon Gods anger for
ſynne in Adam and Eue: For eating
a pece of an apple. Were not
thei the deareſt creatures of god
caſt oute of Paradyſe? were not
they ſubiect to mortalitie, traueil

labour. &c? was not the earth accurſed
for theyr ſinnes? Doe not
we all, men in laboure, women in
traueling with chylde, and all in
death, mortalitie, & miſerie, euen
in thys lyfe feele the ſame? And
was god ſo angry for theyr ſinne
and he being the ſame God, wyll
he ſaye nothing to vs for oures,
halas muche more horrible then
the eating once of one pece of an
apple?
            In the tyme of Noe and Lot,Gen. vi.
God deſtroyed the whole world
with water,Gen. xix & the cities of Sodoma
and Gomorra, Seboim &
Adamah with fyre and brimſton
from heauen, for theyr ſynnes:
Namely for theyr whoredomes,
pryde, idlenes, vnmercifulnes to
the poore, tyrannie. &c. In which
wrath of God euen the very babes,
byrdes, foules, fiſhes, herbes

trees, and graſſe periſſhed. And
thinke we that nothinge wylbe
ſpokē to vs, muche worſe & more
abhominable thē they? For al mē
may ſee yf they wil ye the whoredōs,
pride, vnmercifulnes, tirannie.
&c, of England far paſſeth in

            At the leaſt in Chyldren, infauntes,
and ſuch like, which yet

can not vtter ſynne by worde or

Synne, in punyſſhynge

or otherwyſe ſo playnely
that we cannot but grone and
grount agayne, in that we a lyttell

            And here with me a litel loke
on gods anger, yet ſo freſhe, that
we cannot but ſmell it, although
we ſtop our noſes neuer ſo much
I praye God we ſmel it not more
freſhe hereafter. I meane it forſoth
(for I know you loke for it)
in our dere late ſouereigne lorde
the kyngs maieſte. You al know
he was but a chylde in yeares:
defyled he was not with notorious
offences. Defiled ꝙ he? naye
rather adorned wt ſo many good

and wonderfull qualities as neuer
prynce was from the begynnyng
of ye world. Shuld I ſpeak
of his wyſedome? of his rypenes
in iudgement? of his learning? of
his Godlye zeale, heroical heart,
fatherly care for his commons,
norcely ſolicitude for religion? &c
naye ſo manye thinges are to be
ſpoken in commendatiō of gods
excedyng graces in this childe,
that as Saluſt wryteth of Chartage
I had rather ſpeak nothing
then to lytel, in yt to much is to litle.
This gift God gaue vnto vs
Englyſh men, before all nations
vnder the ſonne, and that of his
excedynge loue towardes vs.
But alas and welawaye for our
vnthankefulnes ſake, for our ſinnes
ſake, for our carnalitie, and
prophan liuing, gods anger hath
touched not only ye body, but alſo

the mynde of our king, by a long
ſycknes, and at length hath takē
hym awaye by death, death, cruell
death, fearful death, death. &c
            Oh if Gods iudgement be begon
on him, which as he was the

godlieſt in ye realme of England,Pſalm. xxxvij.
alas what wyl it be on vs, whoſe
ſynnes are ouergrowne ſo oure
heades, that they are climed vp
into heauen.
            I pray you my good brethren
know that gods anger for oure
ſinnes towardes vs cannot but
be great, yea to fel, in that we ſe it
was ſo great, that our goodking
coulde not beare it. What folowed

Ioſias? God ſaue England, and
geue vs repētaunce, my hart wil

I trow this wyll thruſte oute

ſome teares of repentaunce.
            Yf therfore to praier for gods
feare, the tootynge in gods glas
and the tagge thereto, wyll not
burſte open thy blockyſh hearte,
yet I trowe the toſſinge to and

troubleſome tyme, wyll tomble
ſome teares oute of thyne hart,
yf thou ſtyll praye for Gods ſpirite

thee, more then they, whoſe examples
thou haſt harde? what
frendes haſte thou? were not of

Learned, and commen of

yf I beleue GOD, beynge the
ſame GOD that he was, wyll

ſpare me, whoſe wyckedneſſe
is no leſſe, but muche more then

the greater vengeaunce wyll

            But yf yet thy harte be ſo
hardened, that all thys geare
wyll not moue thee: Suerlye
thou arte in a verye euyll eſtate,
and remedy now know I none.
What ſayde I none? knowe I
none? yes, yet there is one which
is ſureſbye as they ſaye, to ſerue
yf anye thynge will ſerue. you
loke to knowe what this is?
            Forſooth the paſſion and death
of Ieſus CHRISTE. You
knowe the cauſe whye Chriſte

become man, and ſuffered as he
ſuffered, was the ſynnes of hys
people thot he myght ſaue them
from the ſame. Conſider ye greatnes
of the ſoore. I meane ſinne,
by the greatenes of the Surgion,
and of the ſalue. Who was
the Surgion? no Aungell, no
ſainct, no Archaungel, no power
no creature in heuē, nor in earth,
but onely he by whom al thinges
were made, all thinges are ruled
alſo, euen Gods owne dearlyng,
and onely beloued Sonne, becō
               mynge

            Oh what a great thinge is this
that coulde not be doone by the
aungels, archaūgels, poteſtates,
powers, or all the creatures of
God, without his owne Sonne,
who yet muſte nedes be thruſte
out of heauen, as a man woulde

ſaye, to take oure nature and become
man? Here haue ye the ſurgion,
greate was the cure that
this mightye Lorde toke in

            Nowe, what was the ſalue?
Forſoth dere geare, and of many

but rather muſt leaue it to your
hartye conſiderations. Three &
thyrtye yeares was he curynge

                I read how buſy he was
aboute a plaiſter in the garden,Lu. xxij.
when he lying flat on ye grounde
prayenge with teares, and that
of bloud not a fewe, but ſo manye
as dydde flowe downe on the
grounde agayne, cryinge on
this ſorte: Father ſayth he, yf it

be poſſible, lette this ruppe departe
frome me, that is, yf it be
poſſible els mankyndes ſynnes
canne be taken awaye, graunte
that it maye be ſo. Thou hardeſt
Moyſes cryinge for the ydolaters:
Thou hardeſt Lot for the
zoarites: Samuell, Dauyd, and
manye other for the Iſraelites,
and deare Father, I onelye am
thyne owne ſonne, as thou haſt
ſayde, in whome thou arte well
pleaſed, wylte thou not heare
me? I haue by the ſpace of three
and thyrty yeares done always
thy wyll, I haue ſo humbled my

abiecte amongeſte men to obeye
thee: Therefore deare father yf
it be poſſible graunt my requeſt,
ſaue mankynde nowe wythoute
any further laboure, Salues, or

playſters? But yet (ſayth he) not
as I wyll, but as thou wylte.
            But ſyr what harde he? thoughe
he ſweate bloude and water
in makynge his playſter for
oure ſore of ſynne, yet it framed
not: twyſe he cryed withoute
comforte: yea▪ thoughe to comfort
hym, GOD ſente an Aungell,
we yet knowe that thys
Playſter was not alowed for ſufficiente,
vntyll herevnto Chriſte
Ieſus was betrayed, forſaken of
all hys Diſcyples, forſworne of
his dearelye beloued, bounde
lyke a thefe, belyed on, buffeted,
whypped, ſkourged, crowned
with thornes, derided, crucified,
racked, nayled, hanged vppe betwene
twoo theues, curſed and
rayled vppon, mocked in myſerye,
and hadde geuen vppe the

ghoſte then bowed downe the
heade of Chriſte, that is GOD
the father, whyche is the heade
of Chriſte, i. Corinth. xi. then alowed
he the playſter to be ſufficient
and good for the healynge
of our ſore, which is ſynne. Now
wolde God abyde our breath, becauſe
the ſtincke, that is dampnation
or gyltyneſſe was taken awaye,
by the ſwete ſauour of the
breath of this lambe, thus offered
once for all.
            So that here dearelye beloued,
we as in a glaſſe, maye ſe to
the brooſynge of oure blockyſhe
harde heartes, Goddes greate
iudgement and anger agaynſte
ſynne: The Lorde of Lordes,

of Goddes glorye, the ſonne

hys father, in whome he is well

pleaſed, hangeth betwene twoo

and for vs all, My God, my god,
why haſte thou forſaken me?
            Oh harde heartes that we haue
whiche make tuttes for ſynne?
looke on thys toote in the verye
harte of Chriſte, pearced wyth
a ſpeare, wherein thou mayeſte
ſee and reade Goddes horrible
anger for ſinne? woo to thy hard
harte that pearſed it.
            And thus muche for the fyrſte
parte of repentaunce, I meane
for the meanes of workynge
contricion. Fyrſte vſe prayer, thē
looke on GODDES lawe,
thyrdely, ſe hys curſe, fourthlye,
ſette exaumples of his anger:
and laſte of all, ſette before thee,
the death of Chriſte, frome this
and prayer ceaſe not, tyll thou
feele ſome hartye ſorowe for thy

Sinne. The whiche when thou
fealeſte, then laboure for the other
parte, that is fayth on this
ſorte.
            As fyrſte in contrition I willed
thee not to truſte to thy free
wyll for thattaininge of it, ſo do
I wyll thee in this. Fayth is ſo
farre frome the reache of mannes
free wyll: that to reaſonne
it is playne folyſhnes. Therefore
thou muſte fyrſte go to GOD,
whoſe gyfte it is: thou muſte I
ſaye, gette thee to the father of
mercye, whoſe woorke it is,
            Iohn the ſyxth, that as he hathe
brought ye downe by contricion,
and humbled thee, ſo he woulde
geue the fayth, rayſe thee vppe,
Colloſſians. ii, and exalte thee.
            On this manner therefore, with
the Apoſtles, and the poore man
in the Goſpell that cryed, Lorde

encreaſe oure fayeth, Lorde
helpe my vnbeleife, praye thou
and ſaye.
            O mercyfull GOD, and
deare father of oure Lorde and
ſauyoure Ieſus Chriſt, in whom
as thou arte well pleaſed, ſo haſt
thou commaunded vs to heare
hym, foraſmuche as he often biddeth
vs, to aſke of thee, and ther
to promyſeth that thou wylte
heare vs, and graunte vs that
whyche in hys name we ſhall
aſke of thee: Loe gracious father
I am bolde to begge of thy
mercye thoroughe thy Sonne
Ieſus Chriſte, one ſparckle of
true fayth and certayne perſwaſion
of thy goodnes, and loue towardes
me in Chriſte, where
throughe I beynge aſſewred
of the pardonne of all my ſinnes,
by the mercyes of Chriſte thy

Sonne, maye be thankefull to
thee, loue thee, and ſerue thee, in
holynes and rightuouſnes al the
dayes of my lyfe.
            On this ſorte I ſaye, or otherwyſe,
as God ſhall moue thee,
praye thou fyrſte of all, and looke
for thy requeſt at GODDES
hande withoute any doubtyng,
thoughe forthwith thou feeleſte
not the ſame: for often tymes we
haue thynges of GOD geuen
vs, longe before we feele them as
we woulde do. Nowe vnto thys
prayer vſe thou theſe meanes folowynge.
            After prayer for fayth, which
I woulde ſhoulde be firſte: Secondlye
becauſe the ſame ſpryngeth
oute of the hearynge, not of
Maſſes, Mattens, Cannons,
councels doctours, decrees, but
out of the hearing of gods word:

Get the gods word, but not that
part whiche ſerueth ſpeciallye to
contricion, that is the lawe, but
the other part which ſerueth ſpecially
to conſolacion, and certayn
perſwaſiō of gods loue towards
the, that is the Goſpel or publication
of Gods mercy in Chriſt, I
meane the free promyſes.
            But here thou muſt knowe, yt
there is two kyndes of promiſes
one which are properly of ye law,
another which ar properly of the
Goſpell.
            In the promyſes of the lawe,
we may in dede behold Goddes
mercy, but ſo that it hāgeth ouer
the condicion of our worthynes,
as yf thou loue the Lord with al
thy hearte. &c, thou ſhalte fynde
mercy.
            This kynd of promyſes though
it declare vnto vs Goddes loue,

which promiſeth wher he nedeth
not, yet vnto him that feleth not
Chriſte, whiche is the ende of the
law, they are ſo farre from cōfortinge,
that vtterly with the law,
they bringe manne to greate diſpayre,
ſo greatly we are corrupt:
for none ſo loueth GOD as he
oughte to doe. From theſe
therfore get the to the other promyſes
of the Goſpel in which we
may ſee ſuche plentie and franke
liberalite of Gods goodnes, that
we can not, but be muche comforted,
though we haue very depelye
ſynned.
            For theſe promyſes of the goſpell
doe not hange on the condicion
of oure worthyneſſe as the
promyſes of the law do: but they
depende and hange on Goddes
trueth, that as GOD is true, ſo
they can not, but be perfourmed

to al thē which lay holde on them
by faith, I had almoſt ſayd which
caſt them not away by vnbelefe.
            Marke in them therfore two
thinges, nameli, that as wel they
are free promyſes, without anye
condiciō of our worthines, as alſo
that they are vniuerſal, offred
to al, (all I ſaye) which are not ſo
ſtubborne as to kepe ſtyll▪ theyr
handes, whereby they ſhould receaue
this almeſſe in theyr boſomes
by vnbeliefe: As concerning
infantes and children you know
I now ſpeake not, but cōcerning
ſuch as be of yeres of diſcrecion.
            And now you loke that I ſhuld
geue you a taſt of theſe promyſes
whiche are both free and vniuerſall,
excepting none but ſuche, as
excepte themſelues? Well you
ſhall haue one or two for a ſaye.
            
               
In the thyrde of Iohn ſayeth
our Sauiour: ſo God the Father
loued the world, that he woulde
geue his dearling, his owne only
ſonne, that all that beleue in hym
ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting
lyfe. Lo ſyr, he ſayeth not
that ſome might haue lyfe: but al
ſayth he, And what all? all yt loue
him wyth all theyr heartes? all yt
haue lyued a godly lyfe? naye, all
yt beleue in him, all thoughe thou
haſt liued a moſt wicked and horrible
lyfe, yf nowe thou beleue in
him, thou ſhalte be ſaued. Is not
this ſwete geare?
            Agayne ſayth Chriſt. Mat. xi
come vnto me all you that labor,
and are laden, and I wyll refreſh
you. Let vs a little loke on thys
letter: come vnto me. Who ſhuld
come Lord? Prieſtes, Holy men,
Monkes, Freres? Yea coblers,

tinkers, whores, theues, murtherers

ſinnes. Come vnto me ſayth he,
all ye that labour and are laden,
that is, which are afrayd for your
ſinnes: And what wilte thou doe
Lorde? and I wyll refreſhe you

            Oh what a thinge is this: and
I wyll refreſſhe you: wote you
who ſpake thys? he that neuer

ſaluacion to all mē. As frō Adam
all haue receyued ſinne to dampnation:

offred to ſaluacion, yf they reiect
not the ſame. I ſpeake not nowe

whiche are nye,Actun̄. ij that is, to ſuche
as are fallen a lyttle: but alſo to
all whome the LORDE hath
called, be they neuer ſo farre of.
Loe nowe by me the Lorde calleth
thee thou manne, thou woman,

promyſe therfore pertayneth to
thee, nedes muſte thou be ſaued,
excepte thou wyth Sathan ſay,
GOD is falſe:ij. tim. ij. and yet yf thou
do ſo, GOD is faythful, and can
not denye him ſelfe: as thou ſhalt

diſhonoringe God to thinke that

            Wyll he be founde falſe now?
the matter hangeth not on thy
worthyneſſe, but it hangeth on
Gods truth. Clap hold on it, and

to heare me to ſpeake this, and

very many, as alſo daylye

            Adam in Paradyſe tranſgreſſed
greuouſly as the paynful puniſhment,
Gen. iii. which we al as yet doe
feele, proueth, yf nothinge elſe.
            Thoughe by reaſon of his ſynne
he diſpleaſed God, ſore and ran
awaye from God, for he woulde
haue hyd him ſelfe, yea he would
haue made God the cauſer of his
ſynne, in that he gaue hym ſuch a
mate, ſo farre was he frō aſkinge
merry yet all this not withſtandinge,
GOD turned hys fearce
wrath, nether vpō him, nor Eue,
which alſo requyred not mercye,

but vpon the ſerpente Sathan:
Promyſing vnto them a ſede Ieſus
Chriſte, by whom they at the
lenght ſhoulde be delyuered: In
token whereof, though they wer
caſte oute of Paradyſe, for theyr
nurture, to ſerue in ſorow, which
woulde not ſerue in ioye, yet he
made thē apparell to couer theyr
bodies, a viſible ſacramente and
tokē of his inuiſyble loue & grace,
concerning theyr ſoules.
            Yf God was ſo merciful to Adam,
whych ſo ſore brake hys cō
               maundemēt,
and rather blamed
God, then aſked mercy, troweſte
thou oh man, that he wyll not be
mercyful to the, whiche blameſte
thy ſelfe and deſyreſt pardon.
            To Cayn he offered mercy,Gen. iiij yf
he woulde haue aſked it: What
haſte thou done ſayeth God? the
voyce of thy brothers bloude

cryeth vnto me, out of the earth:
Oh mercyfull Lord (ſhuld Cayn
haue ſayd) I cōfeſſe it. But halas
he dyd not ſo: And therfore ſayd
God. Now, that is, in that thou
deſyreſt not mercy, now I ſay: be
thou accurſed. &c. Lo to the reprobate
he offred mercy, and wil
he denye it thee whiche arte hys
chylde.
            Noah dyd not he ſynne and
was drōke:Gent. ix God Lot alſo both
in Sodome diſſembled a lyttle
wyth the Aungels,Gen. xix prolonginge
the tyme, & out of Sodom he fell
very foule:Gene. 38 xxxvij. as did Iudas, and the
Patriarches, agaynſte Ioſeph,
but yet I wene they foūd mercy.
            Moyſes,Num. xi Myriam, Aaron,
though they tombled a little, yet
receaued they mercye: yea the
people in the wylderneſſe often
ſynned & diſpleaſed God ſo that

he was purpoſed to haue deſtroyed
them:Exod. 32 let me alone ſayth he to
Moyſes, that I maye deſtroye
them, but Moyſes dyd not lette
hym alone, for he prayed ſtyll for
them, and therefore God ſpared
them. Yf the people were ſpared
throughe Moyſes prayer, they
not praying with him, but rather
worſhipping theyr golden calfe,
eatinge, drinkinge, and makinge
ioly good cheare: why ſhouldeſte
thou doubte, whether God wyll
be mercyfull to thee: hauynge as
in dede thou haſt, one muche better

In this hys ſynne thoughe
a great whyle he laye a ſlepe (as
many do now a dayes, god geue

that by hys ſacrifices he offered,
all was well, God was content:

ſynned and am worthye of eternall
dampnatiō. But what ſayth
God by his Prophete: Dominus
(ſayth he) transtulit peccatum tuū
non morieris, the Lorde hath taken
awaye thy ſynnes, thou ſhalt
not dye. Oh good God, he ſayd
but peccaui, I haue ſynned, but

yet from his harte, and not from
the lyppes onelye, as Pharao &
Saule dyd, and incontinentelye
he heareth: Thou ſhalte not dye:
the Lorde hath taken away thy
ſynnes, or rather hath layde
them vpon an other, yea tranſlated
them vppon the backe of hys

            Thus haue you. iiii. meanes,

which you muſt vſe to that tayning
of fayth, or certaine perſwaſiō
of gods mercy towards you,
whiche is the ſecond part of pennaunce:
namely, prayer, the fre &
vniuerſall promiſes of Goddes
grace, the recordation of the benefites
of god paſt and preſente,
the exāples of gods mercy, whiche
although they myght ſuffice,
yet wyl I put one moo to them,
whiche alonelye of it ſelfe is full
ſufficiente, I meane the death of
the ſonne of God Ieſus Chriſte,
which yf thou ſet before the eyes
of thy mynd it wyl confyrme thy
plackarde, for it is the great ſeale
of Englande, as they ſaye, yea of
all the worlde, for the confyrmation
of all patentes and perpetuities
of the euerlaſtynge lyfe,
whervnto we are all called.
            Yf I thoughte theſe whyche

I haue before recited, were not
ſufficient to confyrme your faith
of gods loue towardes ſuche as
do repente. I woulde tarry longer
herein: But becauſe both I
haue bene longe, and alſo I truſt
you haue ſome exercyſe of conſcience
in this daylye (or els you
are to blame) I wyll but touche
and go. Conſider with youre ſelues,
what we are, miſers, wretches,
and enemies to God: Conſider
what God is, euen he whiche
hath al power, maieſte, might
glorye, ryches, &c. perfectlye of
hym ſelfe, and neadeth nothyng,
but hath all thinges: Conſider
what Chriſt is: Concernyng his
godhead, coequall wt his father,
euen he by whō al thynges were
made are ruled & gouerned: Concerninge
his manhode, the only
dearlyng of his father, in whom

is all his ioye. Nowe ſyr what a
loue is this, that this God, whiche
neadeth nothyng, wold geue
wholly his owne ſelfe to thee his
ennemy, wreakyng his wrath vpon
hym ſelfe, in this his ſonne,
as a man maye ſaye, to ſpare the,
to ſaue thee, to wyn thee, to bye
thee, to haue thee, to enioye thee
for euer.
            Becauſe thy ſynne had ſeperated
the from hym, to the ende
yu myghteſte come eftſones into
his company agayne, and therin
remayne, he hym ſelfe became as
a man wolde ſaye, a ſynner, or rather
ſynne it ſelf, euen a malediction
or a curſe: that we ſynners,
we accurſed by his ſinne, that by
his oblation or offeringe for our
ſynnes, by hys curſe, might be delyuered
from ſynne, from malediction.
For by ſynne, he deſtroyed

ſynne, killinge death, ſathan, and
ſynne, by theyr owne weapons,
and that for thee & me (man) if we
caſt it not awaye by vnbeleif.
Oh wonderful loue of God? who
euer harde of ſuche a loue? The
father of heauen for vs his ennemies,
to geue his owne deare
ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and that not
onely to be our brother, to dwell
amonge vs, but alſo to the death
of the croſſe for vs? Oh wōderful
loue of Chriſt to vs all: that was
contēt and wylling to work this
feate for vs? Was there any loue
lyke to this loue?
            God in dede hathe commended
his charitie and loue to vs
herein,Rom▪ v. that when we were very
ennemyes vnto hym, he woulde
geue his own ſonne for vs: That
we beyng men, might become as
you would ſaye gods, God wold
become man: That we being mortall,

might become immortal, the
immortal God wold become mortal
man: That we earthlye wretches
might be ſitizens of heauen,
the Lorde of heauen woulde become
as a man wolde ſay earthlye,
that we beynge accurſed,
myght be bleſſed, God wolde be
accurſed: That we by our father
Adam, beyng brought oute of paradice,
into the puddel of al pain,
myght be redemed, and brought
into paradyce agayne, god wold
be our father, and an Adam ther
vnto: That we hauyng nothing,
might haue all thinges, God hauynge
all thinges, woulde haue
nothyng. That we being veſſels
and ſlaues to al, euen to ſathan ye
fend, myght be lordes of all, and
of Sathan, the lorde of al would
become a vaſſall and a ſlaue to vs
all, and in daunger of Sathan:
Oh loue incomprehenſible? who

can otherwyſe thinke nowe, but
yf the gratious good Lorde diſdayned
not to geue his owne
Sonne, his own hartes ioye for
vs his very ennemies, tofore we
thought to begge any ſuch thing
at his hands, ye tofore we were:
who I ſay, can thinke otherwiſe,
but that with him he wil geue vs
all good thynges?
            Yf when we hated hym, and
fledde awaye from hym, he ſente
his ſonne to ſeke vs, who canne
thynke otherwyſe, thē yt now we
louynge hym, and lamentynge
becauſe we loue him no more, but
that he wyll for euer loue vs.
            He that geueth the more to his
ennemyes, wyll not he geue the
leſſe trowe you to his frendes?
God hath giuen his owne ſonne,
then whiche thinge, nothinge is
greater to vs his enemies, and

we nowe beyng become his frendes,
wyll he denye vs fayth, and
pardone of oure ſynnes, whiche
thoughe they be greate, yet in
compariſone, nothynge at all.
            Chriſt Ieſus, woulde geue hys
owne ſelfe for vs, when we wylled
it not, and wil he nowe denye
vs fayth yf we wyll it.
            This wyll is his earneſt that he
hath geuen vs,Phil. ij. truely to loke in
dede, for the thyng wylled: And
loke thou for it in deede, for as he
hath geuen thee to wyll, ſo wyll
he geue thee to do.
            Ieſus Chriſt gaue his lyfe for
oure euylles, and by his deathe
delyuered vs: Oh, then in that
he lyueth nowe, and cannot dye,
wyll he forſake vs? His hearte
bloude was not to deere for vs,
when we aſked it not: what can
then be nowe to dere for vs, aſkyng

it? is he a chaungelyng? is
he mutable as man is? can he repent
hym of his gyftes? Did he
not foreſee our falles? payde not
he therefore the pryce. Becauſe
he ſawe we ſhulde fail ſore, therfore
wolde he ſuffer ſore. Yea if
his ſufferynges hadde not bene
enoughe, he would yet once more
come agayne. GOD the father
I am ſure, yf the deathe of hys
ſonne incarnate wold not ſerue,
woulde him ſelfe and the holye
ghoſt alſo become incarnate, and
dye for vs. This death of Chriſt
therfore loke on, as ye very plege
of Gods loue towards the, whoſoeuer
thou art, howe deepe ſoeuer
thou haſt ſinned? See Gods
handes are nayled, they cannot
ſtryke thee, his feete alſo, he cannot
runne from thee, his armes
are wide open to imbrace the, his

heade hanges down to kyſſe the,
his verye harte is open, ſo that
therein ſee, roote, looke, ſpie, pepe
and thou ſhalte ſe nothyng therin
but loue, loue, loue, loue to the,
hide thee therefore, lay thy head
there with the Euangeliſte.

raygned to death as thou ſe eſt,
to the kyllyng of Goddes ſonne,
ſo nowe grace muſt raigne to life
to the honouryng of gods ſonne,
who is nowe alyue, and cannot
dye any more.
            So that they which by fayth
fele this cannot any more dye to
God but to ſynne, wherto they
are dead and buried with chriſt.
As Chriſt therfore lyueth, ſo do
they, and that to God, to ryghtuouſnes
and holynes. The lyfe
which they lyue is in fide fily dei.
in the fayth of the ſonne of God,
whereby you ſee that now I am
ſlipt into that which I made the

thyrde parte of penaunce, namely
newnes of lyfe, which I could
not ſo haue done, yf that it were
a parte of it ſelfe in deede, as it is
an effect, a freewyt, of the ſeconde
parte that is of fayth or truſte in
Gods mercy.
            For he that beleueth, that is,
is certaynly perſwaded ſynne to
be ſuch a thing that it is the cauſe
of al miſerie, and of it ſelf ſo greatly
angreth God, that in heauen
nor in earth nothinge coulde appeaſe
his wrath ſaue alonely the
death & preciouſe bloudſhe dinge
of the ſonne of God, in whome is
al the delight and pleaſure of the
father: He I ſay that is perſwaded
thus of ſinne: the ſame cānot
but in hearte abhorre and quake
to doe or ſaye, yea to thinke anye
thing willingly which Gods law
teachet him to be ſinne. Agayne

he that beleueth, that is, is certaynly
perſwaded Gods loue to
be ſo much towards him, yt wher
through ſynne he was loſte, and
made a fyre brand of hel: the eternal
Father of mercy, which is the
omniſufficient God, & nedeth nothing
of vs, or of any thinge yt we
can do: to delyuer vs out of hell, &
to bring vs into heauē, dyd ſende
euē his own moſt dere ſonne out
of his boſome, out of heauen, into
hell as a man would ſay, to bring
vs as I ſayd frō thence, into his
owne boſome & mercy, we beyng
his very enemies: He I ſay that
is thus perſwaded of gods loue
towardes him, & of ye price of his
redempcion, by the dere bloud of
the lābe imaculate Ieſus Chriſt:
the ſame mā cannot but loue god
agayn, & of loue do that, & hartely
deſire to do better yt which might
pleaſe God. Trow you that ſuch

a one knowīg this geare by faith
wil willingly walter & wallow in
his woful luſtes, pleſure & fantiſties.
Wil ſuche a one as knoweth
by faith chriſt Ieſus to haue geuē
his bloud, to waſh him frō his ſinnes,
play the ſow to walter in his
puddell of fylthie ſinne & vyce agayn?
Nay rather thē he wylbe
defiled agayn, by wilfull ſinning,
he wil waſh oftē the fete of his affectiōs,
watching ouer ye vice ſtyl
ſticking in him, which as a ſpring
cōtinually ſendeth out poyſon ynough
to drown & defile him, did
not the ſwete water of Chriſtes
paſſion in gods ſight waſh it, and
his bloude ſatiſfie the rigoure of
Gods iuſtice due for the ſame.
            This bloud of chriſt ſhed for our
ſinnes, is to dere in the ſighte of
him, that beleueth that he wil abhorre
in his hart to ſtampe it, and

treade it vnder his feete.
            He knoweth nowe by his belefe
that it is to muche that hetherto
he hath ſet to little by it, &
is aſhamed therof. Therfore the
reſydue of hys lyfe he purpoſeth
to take better heede to him ſelfe
then to fore he dyd. For becauſe
he ſeeth by his fayth the greuouſnes
of Gods anger, the foulenes
of ſynne, the greatneſſe of Gods
mercye, and of Chriſtes loue towardes
him, He wyll nowe be
headie, to praye God to geue him
his grace accordingly: that as wt
his eyes, tonge, handes, feete. &c.
He hath diſpleaſed God doynge
his owne wyl, euen ſo now, with
the ſame eyes, tonge, eares, handes,
feete. &c. He maye diſpleaſe
his owne ſelfe, and do Gods wil.
Willinglye wyll he nowe do that
which mighte renewe the death

of the ſonne of God: He knoweth
he hath to much ſinne vnwillingly
in hym, ſo that there to he wyl
not adde wylling offences.
            This willing and witting offending,
and ſinning, whoſoeuer
doeth flatter him ſelfe therein,
doth euidently demonſtrate and
ſhewe that he neuer yet in dede
taſted of Chriſte truelye. He
was neuer truely perſwaded, or
beleued how foule a thinge ſynne
is, how greuous a thinge Gods
anger is, howe ioyfull and precious
a thing Gods mercy in chriſt
is, nowe exceding broade, wyde,
highe and depe Chriſtes loue is.
Perchaunce he can wryte, prate,
talke, and preache of thys geare,
but yet he in hart by fayth, neuer
felte this geare. For dyd he once
feele this geare in dede, thē wold

iniquitie: euē ſo we beynge made
free from ſinne by fayth in Ieſus
Chriſt & endewed with gods ſpirite,
a ſpirit of libertie .ij. Cor. iij▪
muſt nedes demōſtrate this fredō
& libertie by geuing ouer oure
mēbres to thobediēce of ye ſpirite
by ye which we are led & gyded frō
vertue to vertue, & al kind of holynes.
As thunbeleuers declare
their vnbeliefe by ye working of ye
euil ſpirit in thē. Eph, ij▪ outwardly
the fruites of the fleſhe. Gal. v.
            
               
Euen ſo the beleuers declare
theyr fayth by the workinge of
gods good ſpirit in thē outwardly
the fruites of the ſpirit. For as
the deuyll is not deade in thoſe
whiche are hys but worketh ſtyll
to theyr dampnacion: ſo is not
God dead in them whiche be his,
but worketh ſtyll to their ſaluaciō:
the which working is not the
cauſe of ye one or thother being in
any, but only a demonſtracion, a
ſigne, a fruit of the ſame, as ye aple
is not the cauſe of ye aple tree, but
a fruite of it. Thus then you ſee
briefely that newnes of life is not
in dede a parte of penaunce but a
fruit of it, a demonſtracion of the
iuſtyfying fayth, a ſygne of gods
good ſpirite poſſeſſing the heart
of the penitent: As the old lyfe is
a fruyte of impenitencie, a demō
               ſtraciō
of a lippe, fayth or vnbelief

a ſigne of Sathans ſpirit poſſeſſing
the heart of the impenitent,
which al thoſe be that be not penitent.
For mean I knowe none,
he that is not penitent, that ſame
is impenitent, he that is not gouerned
by Gods ſpirite, the ſame
is gouerned by Sathans ſpirit.
For all that be Chriſtes are gouerned
with the ſpirite of Chriſt,
Rom. viii, which ſpirite hath her
fruites, Gala. v. Al other that be
not Chriſtes are the deuyls. He
that gathereth not with Chriſte,
ſcattereth abroade.
            Therefore dearely beloued I
beſeche you to cōſyder this geare
and deceaue not your ſelues. Yf
you be not Chriſtes, then pertain
you to the deuyl, of which thinge
the fruites of the fleſhe doeth aſſure
you, as whoredom▪ adultry,
vncleanes, wantonnes, ydolatri,

witchcraft, enuie, ſtrife, contencion,
wrathe, ſedicion, murthers,
dronkenes, glottonie, blaſphemy
ſlouthfulnes, ydlenes, baudy talking,
ſclaunderinge. &c. Yf theſe
apples growe oute of the apple
trees of your hearts, ſurely, ſurely
the deuylis at Inne with you:
you are his byrdes, whom, when
he hath wel fed you, he wyl broch
you and eate you, chaw you, and
champ you, world without ende
in eternall wo and miſerie. But
I am otherwyſe perſwaded of
you al: I truſt you be al Chriſtes
Ieſus his people and childrē, yea
brethren by fayth.
            As ye ſee your ſinnes in Gods
lawe and tremble ſyghe, ſorow, &
ſob for the ſmae, euen ſo you ſee
his great mercies in his Goſpell
and free promiſes, and therefore
are glad, merrie, and ioyefull for

that you are accepted into Gods
fauour, haue your ſinnes pardoned,
ij. Cor. i. & ar endued wt ye good ſpirit
of God, euē the ſeale & ſigne manuel
of your electiō in Chriſte before
the beginning of the world.
            The which ſpirite, for that he
is the ſpirit of life geuē to you, to
worke in you, with you, & by you
here in this lyfe,i. theſ. iiij ſanctificaciō and
holynes where vnto you are called,
i. Petr. i that ye might be holy euen as
your heauenly father is holye: I
beſeche you all by admonicion &
warninge of you that you wolde
ſtirre up the gyftes of God geuē
to you generalli & particulerli to
ye edifying of hys Church,ij. Tim. i that is
I praye you that you would not
moleſte the good ſpyryt of God
by rebellinge agaynſte it,Eph. iiij when it
prouoketh and calleth you to go
on forewardes, that he which is

holy,Apo. xxij myght yet be more holy, he
whyche is righteous myghte be
more righteous. As the euyl ſpirite
moueth and ſtirreth vp the
fylthy, to be yet more fylthy, the
couetous, to be more couetous,
the wicked to be more wicked.
            Declare you now your repentaunce
by workes of repentaūce
bring forth fruites, and worthye
fruytes, lette youre ſorowing for
your euyls demonſtrate it ſelfe,
by departinge frō the euyls you
haue vſed, let your certayntie of
pardon of your ſinnes throughe
Chriſte and youre ioye in hym be
demonſtrated by purſuing of the
good thinges which gods word
teacheth you: you are nowe in
Chriſt Ieſus gods workemāſhip
to do good workes,Epheſ. ij whiche God
hath prepared for you to walk in
For the grace of God yt bringethTitus. ij
               
ſaluacion vnto al men hath apeared,
& teacheth vs that we ſhould
denie vngodlines, and worldlye
luſtes, and that we ſhould liue ſobrelye,
righteouſlye and godly
in this preſent worlde, lokinge
for that bleſſed hope, & glorious
apearing of the mighty God, and
of oure Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte,
which gaue him ſelf for vs, to redeme
vs from al vnrighteouſnes
and to purge vs a peculier people
vnto him ſelf, feruently geuē vnto
good workes. Titus. ij.
            Agayne Titus .iij, for we our
ſelues alſo were in times paſt vnwyſe,
diſobediente, deceaued, in
daunger to luſtes, and to dyuers
maners of voluptuouſnes, liuing
in maliciouſnes and enuie, full of
hate, hating one another. But after
that the kyndnes and loue of
God our Sauiour, to manward

appeared, not by ye dedes of righteouſnes
which we wrought, but
of his mercye he ſaued vs, by the
fountayn of the new byrth, and
with the renuing of the holy goſt
which he ſhed on vs aboundantly
thorow Ieſus Chriſt our Sauioure,
that we once iuſtifyed by
his grace, ſhould be heires of eternal
lyfe through hope. This is a
true ſaying: but I wyll make an
ende, for I am to tedious.
            Dearely beloued repent your
ſynnes, that is be ſorye, for that
which is paſt, beleue in gods mercy
for pardon, how depely ſoeuer
you haue ſynned, & both purpoſe
and earneſtly purſue a newe lyfe,
bringing forth worthy and true
fruytes of repentaunce.
            As you haue geuen ouer your
members, from ſynne to ſinne, to
ſerue the deuyl: your tongues to

ſweare, to lye, to flatter, to ſkolde
to ieſt, to ſkoffe, to baudy talke, to
vayne iangeling, to boaſting. &c.
Your hādes to picking, groping,
idlenes, fighting, &c, your fete to
ſkipping, going to euil, to daūſing
&c. youre eares to heare fables,
lyes, vanities, & euil thinges. &c.
So now geue ouer your mēbres
to godlines, your tong to ſpeake
youre eares to heare, youre eyes
to ſee, your mouthes to taſt, your
handes to woorke, youre feete
to go about ſuch thinges, as may
make to Gods glorie, ſobrietie of
lyfe, & loue to your brethē, & that
dayly more & more diligently: for
in a ſtay to ſtand you cānot, ether
better or worſſe you are to daye
then you were yeſterdaye.
            But better I truſt you be & wil
be yf you marke wel my theme, yt
is Repent you, ye which thinge that

wold do, as before I haue hūblye
be ſought you: euē ſo now yet once
more I do agayn beſech you, & yt

repēt you, for the kingdō of heauē
that is, a kingdom ful of al riches,
pleaſures, myrth, beautie, ſwetenes,

The eye hath not ſene the lyke,i. Cor. ij. eſa▪ lxiiij ye

which now is at hand, to ſuch
as repent, yt is to ſuch as are ſory
for their ſinnes, beleue gods mercy
through chriſt, & earneſtly purpoſe
to lead a new life: the god of
mercy through Chriſt his ſonne,
graūt vs his holy ſpirit & worke
in our hearts this ſorow, fayth, &
new life which through his grace
I haue ſpoken of, both now & for
