But all haue theyr eyen very ſmale / and lytell heer on their berdes This people in theyr wrytynge haue letters / which in beauty and fayrneſſe of draught reſemble and are moche lyke vnto latten letters / and they ſpeke a language which is moche dyuers from other languages of the world. The beleue of this people is moche dyuers / for ſome beleuyth in the ſonne ſome in the mone / ſome in the ſterres / ſome in naturs of thinges / ſome in the fyre / ſome in the water / ſome in the trees / and ſome beleue in oxen bycauſe they labour the grounde / wher vpon this people haue theyr lyuely ſuſtenaūce.

other ryche landes / wherof they roſe in ſo great pride that they apparellyd galeys and ſhippes and went to Conſtantynople / & fyrſte they aryued in Cipres / and there they toke a cytie that was called Conſtance / & there was the graue of ſaynt Barnabe ye apoſtle / and whan they had taken all ye ryches of the ſayd cytie / they brake ye walles downe to the foundacion / and neuer ſyth the ſayd citie was inhabyted. And than they departed & came to the yle of Rhodes & toke it / with other dyuers yles of the Rhomayns landes / and brought pryſoners without nombre. And after they went to Conſtātinople and layd therto ſege bothe by ſee & by lande / in great fere wer the cytizens in ſomoche that they cryed our lorde mercy / wherof it fortuned god that is mercyfull ſende a great tempeſt of wynd & rayne in that ſomer.

               ¶How that the ſaraſyns entred into the realme of Meſopotamy.
               
                  WHan the chriſten mē of Conſtātynople ſe that they were delyuerd by the grace of god / they made a ſolēpne day for to worſhyp god for ye honour of theyr ſaluatiō which day is kept euery yere to this day with great worſhip After that the ſaraſyns were refreſſhed a certen tyme after thei thought to gather a great nomber of people to take the realme of Meſopotamy / and Calde. That were of the lordſhip of the realme of Perſy / the kynge of Perſy that was called Aſobari othe feringe the great myght of ye ſaraſyns ſende his meſſangers to the kyng & to ye lordes his neyghbours that were at the ſyde of the flode of Phiſon / and required thē of helpe and ſocoure promyſinge great gyftes to all theym yt 
                  ſhold come. And vpon that thei came togyther to the realme of Turky aboute foure thouſande men of armes that were called Turkmens and thei moued for to com & helpe the kinge of Perſy agaynſt the ſaraſyns / and ſo they paſſed ouer ye flode of Phyſon. But for cauſe it is the maner of that peple to cary wyues and chyldern with theym where ſo euer they go / they coude nat take great iourneis. The ſaraſyns that were in the realme of Calde that had taken the ſayd realme thought that yf the hooſt of the Turkmens ſhold come to gether with the hooſt of Perſy they ſholde not lightly acōplyſſh there owne men of the realme of Perſy and toke counſayle to ſende to the kyng of Perſy / & ye kyng of Perſy yt coude nat chuſe put hȳ ayenſt thē. And therby a cytye yt is called Maraga / began a great batayle which laſted lōge in yt which was of bothe partes many men ſlayn.

and at the later ende ye kinge was ſlayne in the batayle and ſo dyed this was in the yere of our lorde god .vi.C. and .xxxiii.
            
            
               ¶How the ſaraſyns choſe theyr ſowdan.
               AFter that the Saraſyns had taken the lordſhyp of Perſye and dyuers realmes / in Aſye they choſe there amonge them a lorde the which they called the Sowdan that is to ſay kynge in latten tonge / the foreſayd Saraſyns toke the lordſhyppe of the lande of the great Aſye except the realme of Abcas that is in Georgy and a countray in the realme of Armeny yt is called Glā
                  ſegarfordis / theſe two countreys holden agaynſt the Sarazyns ſo well that they coude neuer haue ye lordſhip of it. And there the cryſtē men fledde a way for fere of theyr enemys of ye Turkmens yt came for to helpe the kyng of Perſy we ſhall ſay ſome thynge ſhortely bycauſe that their hyſtory ſhall be of more clere vnderſtandyng / the aboueſayd Turkemens came to a lande that is called Coraſten and there they herde tydinges of ye vndoynge of the Perſyens & of the kynges deth / wherfore they wold go no farther / but they thought to holde this ſayde lande of Coraſten for them ſelfe and thought that they ſhold kepe it well ayenſt the ſayd Saraſyns wherof it hapened that ye Saraſyns brought a great hooſt togyder and came agaynſt thē / the Turkmēs feryng ye batayle / dyde ſend theyr meſſē
                  gers to the Calyfe of baldach ꝓferynge them to his cōmaundemēt the which thinge pleaſed moche ye ſayd Calyfe & to ye ſarſyns / and ſo the receyued the Turkmens to a truſt and chaſed theym out of the ſayde lande of Coraſten and put them out to dwell ī a nother land where yt they ſholde nat fere their rebellion and ordayned that they ſholde pay euery yere a tribute to the lordeſhyp. And in this maner abode the Turkemens vnder the lordſhyp of the Saraſyns longe tyme / to ye tyme that the ſaraſyns toke ye lordſhyp of Perſy / Mede / and of Calde. And there they turned all to the falſe lawe of Mahomet. And after it fortuned that the Calyfe of baldach cōmaunded to come before hym all the mooſt old & wyſeſt men of the Turkmens & deſyred them yt they ſholde beleue in Mahometes lawe. And yt they ſhold teche the other Turkmens to beleue ſo / and promyſed them to do them great grace & honour yf they wolde do his commaundment / the Turkmens that had no lawe were lightly conſentynge to the Calyfes wyll / wherof it came that ye Turkemens yt were .lxiiii. nacions were made all ſaraſyns / except two kynredes that were deceyued of the others. And thā thei began to loue the Turkmens & to do them honoure & grace. And ſo longe dwelled ther the Turkmēs

that they multiplyed of goodes & people / and there humbly & wyſely kept themſelfe. And the ſaraſȳs kept ye lordſhyppe of Aſye .iiii.C. and .xviii. yeres / & after they loſte the ſayde lordſhyp as we ſhall deuyſe here after.
            
            
               ¶A cuniuracyon amonge the ſaraſyns.
               IN that tyme it happed that a great debate fell amonge the Saraſyns which laſted in cō
                  tynuaūce .xxx. yeres / that the ſowdans and the lordes of the landes wolde nat obey to the ſowdan of Baldache / but they roſe agaynſt hym / & ſo the Sarſyns power began to myniſſhe. In yt tyme was in Conſtātynople a valiant Emperour which was called Diogines / the which began valiantly to enter into the landes that the Saraſyns had taken from the criſten men in thēperour Eraclos tyme / and to recouer the noble cytyes of Antyoch / ſylice / & Meſopotamy the other landes the ſaraſins kept tyll the tyme that the Turkmens toke it from them as it ſhalbe dyuyſed here after.
            
            
               ¶The fyrſt reygnynge of the turkes in Aſye.
               IN the yere of the Incarnacion of our lorde. M.li. began fyrſte the Turkmens to haue the lordſhyp in Aſye in ſuche maner that whan the Turkmēs wer multiplyed of men and goodes & ſe the great trouble yt was amōge the ſaraſins they thought to haue ryſen agayne wherfore they cam togyder and choſe amōge them a kynge that was Salyoth / & afore that they had neuer lorde of theyr kinred whā they had yt done they began ſo valyantly vpon the ſaraſyns that in ſhorte ſhace they had and ocupyed the lordſhip of Aſye but to the Calyfe of Baldoche they dyde hym no grefe / but they yelded hym great honour / wherof it cam that ye Calyfe more for fere than for loue ordayned Saliothe lorde of the Turkmens. But not longe after themperour Salioth dyed & after hym was his ſonne made lorde which was called Doloryſſa / this man moued ye warre agaynſt themꝑour of Conſtantyple & toke dyuers landes & caſtels a Grece. And after he ſend to the realm of Meſopotamy one of his coſyns which was called Artothe vnto ye which he gaue men ynow and gaue hym the realme of Meſopotamy and al the other landes that he myght gete ayenſt the Grekes / than the great Artothe went with a great nōbre of men & layde ſege to

was moche valyaunt in armes / wherfore the forſayd kyng of Perſy Alpaſſelem gaue a great nomber of men of warr to his neue we Solyman / and ſend hym to Capadoce and graūted hym to hold and kepe all yt he coulde take vpō the grekes. And vpon that wente Solyman & entred in the realme of Turky and there toke cytes realmes / and caſtels & almooſt all ye 
                  land put them vnder his lordſhip wherfore he dyd chaūg his name and was called Solymanſa. and of theſe men the hyſtores maketh mencion of Godfray debullayns paſſage whan he fought with the pylgrimes and dyde them moche harme or they coulde paſſe ye landes of Turky.
            
            
               ¶How ye Grekes were dryuen out of Aſye.
               
                  AFter that dyed Alpaſſelem the turkes emperour / and thā was his ſonne made emꝑour / which was called Melacaceraf the which ſend a commaundment to Artoth ye ſowdan of Meſopotamy and to Solimanſa the ſowdan of Turky that thei ſhold go and lay ſege to the cyte of Antyoche / wherfore they brought togither a great hooſt and laid ſege to Antyoche the which the grekes kept. And not long after thei toke it / and ſo were the grekes dryuen oute of all the landes of Aſye / by the myght of the enemys of ye cryſten fayth. And than after Melacaceraf themperour of ye turkes dyed & laft two chyldern the fyrſt was called Balryaro the whiche kept the lordſhyp after hym / but his brother that was more valyāt in armes ocupyed a great part of the landes of Perſy / and at that tyme that Godfray de bullen paſſed the ſayd Balryaroth was emperour of Aſye and Solymanſa was ſowdan of Turky and dyde many enterpriſes to ye pylgrems or they coulde paſſe the landes of Turkey.
            
            
               ¶How the Cryſten men layde ſege to Antyoche
               
                  WHan the Emperour of Perſy vnderſtod that the cryſten men had layd ſege to the cyte of Antyoche / he brough togyder a great people of the realme of Turkey / and ſende for them for to ſocour the cyte. Or the turkes coulde come / yt myght of ye enemys were ſo great yt they layde ſege rounde about the cyte / wherfore the criſten men that had layde ſege before / were themſelfe beſeged / & at the later end our pilgrimes fought ayenſt this great nomber of enemys ſo well that by the grace of god ye other were all diſcōfyted / & Corberam ye chefe captayn ſlayne / they yt ſcaped out of ye batayle went agayn into Perſy And there the founde yt theyr emꝑour Balryarothe was deed / than his broder wold haue take ye lordſhip but his enmis dyde rone vpō

               ¶How the Coraſmyns cōquered the realme of Perſy.
               
                  IN the realme of Coraſmȳs was a maner of pepyll that dwelled in the mountayns and in the feldys fedynge theyr beeſtes the which were bolde men of armes / theſe men vnderſtode that the realm of Perſy was without a lord wherfore they thought for to conquer it lightly. And than thei cam togyder and dyde choſe a lorde amōge thē which was called Ialaadȳ & whan they had ſo done they went to the noble cytye of Torys without any cōtradictyon of / any man / and there they dwelled and made theyr lorde Ialaadyn Emperour of Aſye for they thought to occupy other realmes of Aſye as they had taken ye realm of Perſy / this Coraſmȳs reſted there certayn dayes and there they were al full of goodes & ryches of Perſy / wherof they toke ſo great pryde yt they entred into ye realm of Turkye and thought to haue ocupyed it & enioyed it / but the ſowdan of Turky that was called Ialaadȳ gethared his hooſt and fought agaynſt the Coraſmyns and ouer cam them and droue theym out of Turky and Ialaadyn theyr Emperour was ſlayn in batayle / and they that ſcaped went into the realme of Meſopotamy / and than came to gyther into the playne of Royhas & there they toke coūſayl betwene them to entre into the realme of Syry which was at that tyme gouerned by a Lady / & then the Coraſmyns cam & brought togyther agayne the hooſt & entred in to Siry. And this noble Lady brought her men togyder in ye cyte of Halap & nygh to the flode of Eufrates / cam to mete the Coraſmyns & fought there great was ye batayle / but at the later ende the Coraſmyns were ouercome / and fled awaye towarde the deſert of Arabe / and after they paſſed ouer the flod of Eufrates nygh to a caſtell that was called Racabe & entred into the realme of Syry and cam to the prouince of Palaſtyne that is in the realme of Hyeruſalē and dyde great damage to the criſten mē as it apereth in ye hiſtoris of the paſſage of Godfray debullayn / & at the laſt this Coraſmins began to murmure & wolde not

                  gere to the ſowdan of Babilon & profered hym his ſeruice / wherof the ſowdan was ryght glad and receyued hym with a good wyll & dyde great honour to ye duke and to them yt came with hym and departed the Coraſmyns by all his landes bycauſe that he wolde nat haue theym all togyther. And becauſe of that / the ſowdans power of Babylon roſe moche for the cō

               ¶What coūtray the Tartas inhabited fyrſte.
               
                  THe lande & countrey there as the Tartas dwelled / fyrſt is betwene the grete moū
                  tayne of Beligian of this mountayn ſpeketh the hyſtores of Alexander there as he maketh mēcyon of the wylde men yt he founde. In that coūtrey dwelled fyrſt ye Tartas as beeſtyſſhe men that had no faythe / nor lawe. But went from place to place as beeſtes fedynge. And of other natyons they were kept ſubgettes to the which they were ſeruaūtes to dyuers natyōs of Tartas that wer named Malgothz came togyther & ordayned captayns & gouernours amonge theym. And ſo they multyplied ſo moche that they were departed in vii. nations. And to this day theſe nations be taken more noble then the other. The fyrſt of this nation is called Tartar / the ſecond Tā
                  gothe / the thryde Curach / ye .iiii. Iaſon / the .v. Sonithe / the ſyxte Mangly / and the .vii. Tebethe. And as it happened that theſe .vii nations dwelled in the ſubgectiō of theyr neyghbours as is before ſayd. It fortuned a poore olde mā that was called Cangius ſawe in dremynge a viſyon / the which to hym ſemyng was a knyght in armour vpon a white horſe / that called hym by his name. And ſayde vnto hym Cangius yt wyll of thy immortall god is ſuche that he oweth to beſhortli gouernor made vpon the .vii. natyons of ye Tartas yt ben called Malgothz and yt by hym they ſhalbe delyuerd oute of the ſaruage that thei had longe ben in / & ſhall haue worſhip vpon theyr neighbours / Cangius roſe vp merily herynge the worde of Chriſt / and reherſed the viſion yt he ſe to all the gentilmen / but they wold nat beleue but ſkorned hym wherfore it fortuned the night folowynge the captayns of the .vii. nations ſe the white horſe in viſiō as Cangius had reherſed. Which cōmaunded by the immortall god

ye they ſholde obey all to Cāgius / and that they ſholde kepe all his cōmaundemētes. wherfore ye .vii. captayns aboueſaid / brought the people togyther / and dyde make obeſaunce and reuerence to Cangius. And they them ſelfe dyde ſo as to theyr naturall lorde.
            
            
               ¶How Cangius was elect emperour of the Tartas.
               
                  AFter that the Tartas ordayned a ſeat in ye myddes of them all & putte there vpon the groūde a blacke carpet and made Cangius to ſyt therupon. And ye vii. captayns of the .vii. natyons reyſed hym vp with the ſayd carpet & ſet hym vpon the ſeate. And named hym Can / and with knelinge dyde hym all honour and reuerence as to theyr owne lorde.
               ¶Of the ſolempnyte yt the Tartas dyde to theyr lorde In ye tyme ſholde no man maruayle of it / for ꝑaduenture they coulde do no better or they had no fayrer clothe to ſet hym on / but for that they wold nat change theyr firſt vſage. It is marueyle ſeynge yt they haue conquered ſo many landes and realmes & yet they kepe theyr fyrſt maner / for thei wyll chuſe their lorde and twyſe haue I ben at thelectyō of the Tartas emperour / they aſſemble togyther in a great felde / & he that ſholde be theyr lorde they cauſed hym to ſytte vpon a blacke carpet and put a ryche ſeate in the myddes of them all. And than after cam the noble men and ye chefe of his kynred and lyft hym vp on hye and ſet hym vpon the ſeate / & after dyde hym all honour & reuerence as to theyr naturall lorde / & for al the lordſhip or riches yt they haue conquered they wode neuer chaūge theyr fyrſt gyſe. And after that Cāgius Can was made emperour by the cōmen wyll and cō
                  ſent of all the Tartas. Firſt of all or Cang. Can wold do any other thinge he wolde knowe if they all wolde be obedient vnto hym and than he cōmaunded .iii. cōmaundemētes. The fyrſt cōmaundemēt was that they ſholde all beleue & worſhyp one god immortall by ye which he was made emꝑour And forthe withall the Tartas began to beleue and worſhip god / and reclamed ye name of god in all theyr warkes and dedes. The ſeconde cōmaundemēt was yt they ſhold viewe and nombre all them that were able to bere harnes / and ordayned that vpon euery .x. ſholde be a captayn / & ouer .C. a captayn and ouer .x.M. was a captayn / & they called the company of the .x. thouſande Thoman.
               ¶After that he cōmaūded to the captayns of the .vii. natyons and lynages of the Tartas that they ſholde yelde vp all theyr armes & lordſhips. And yt they ſholde hold and pay vnto hym as he ſholde or dayn them. The .iii. commaūdemēt that Cāgius Can made was thought moche cruell to them all / 

for he cōmaunded to the foreſayd vii. great captains that euery one ſholde brynge his eldeſt ſonne before hym / and whan they had ſo done. He cōmaūded them yt euery captayn ſholde ſtryke of his ſonnes heed / the which cōmaundmēt they thought was moche felon / & not for becauſe yt they ſhold fere ye people. But bycauſe yt they knew well yt Cangius Can was made emperour by cōmaundement of ye immortall god. And ſo euery one of the .vii. captayns ſtrake of his ſonnes heed. And than whan Cā
                  gius Can knewe the good wyll of his people / and ſe that they wolde obey hym vnto the dethe. Than he cōmaunded that they ſholde be apperylled in knyghtes armour with hym.
            
            
               ¶How Cangius Can was ſaued by a byrde.
               
                  WHan Cangius Can had ordayned well & wyſelye his batayle he entred into the lā
                  des of thē yt had lōge tyme kept the Tartas ſubgettes and fought with theym and ouer came them all / and put theyr landes in his ſubiectyon. After that Cangius Can went forthe cōquerynge landes and countreis / and all thingꝭ went as he wolde. Vpō a day it happened that Cangius Can rode with a ſmale cōpany / & met with a great nombre of his enemys / which ſet ſharpley vpon hym. Cāgius Can defended him valyantly but at the laſt his hors was ſlayne vnder hym. And whā Cangius men ſe that theyr lorde was in the preſe incontynent they loſt their corages and began to fle away. And theyr enemys chaſed after thē / and toke no hede to Cā
                  gius Can themperour that was a fote. Whan Cāgius Can ſe that he hyd hym in a lytell buſſhe that was nere. The enemis that had ye victory began to ſerche for theym that were fled / and as they wolde haue ſerched the ſaid buſſhe wherin Cāgius Can was hyd. A byrd that is called a duke / cam and ſat vpon the ſayd buſſhe. And whan they that ſought for Cāgius Can ſe the byrde ſyttynge vpon ye ſayd buſſhe ther as Cāgius Can was they ſuppoſed no body to be there And deꝑted ſayenge if any body were ther the byrde wolde nat ſyt ther / and ſo they went away with out any more ſerchinge thinkyng that no body ſholde be in the ſayd buſſhe.
            
            
               ¶How and wherfore the Tartas were fethers.
               
                  WHan that nyght cam Cangius Can wente out of the buſſhe / and dyde ſo moche that he cam to his men and coūted to thē all his auenture. And how ye 
                  byrd lyght vpon the buſſhe there as he was hyd / and for that cauſe his enemys ſerched nat for hym. And

than the Tartas rēdred grace to god / & from thenſforthe they had the ſayd byrde / which was called duke in great reuerence. For who that myght haue a feder of ye ſayd byrde gladly wolde were it vpon his heed. Of this hiſtory I haue made mencyon to thende that ye ſholde knowe wherof the Tartas were the feders vpon their heedes Cangius Can rendred grace to god that he was ſo delyuerd in yt maner.
               ¶After yt he aſſembled his hooſt togyder and fought with his enemys and diſcomfyt theym & put theym all in his ſubiection. And Cangius Can conquered all the landes that were from thens to ye mountayn of Belgyan and helde them / ſo moche that he ſe an other viſion as it ſhalbe deuyſed here after. ¶Whan Cangius Can had conquered ye lordſhips of all thoſe countreis that were a this ſyde ye mountayne of Belgyan vpon a nyght it happened that he ſe in vyſion the white knyght agayne the which ſayd vnto hym Cang.

And to thende yt thou ſhalt know that this that I ſay is the wyll of the immortall god.

And he ſhall ſhewe yt / the way & ſo thou mayſt paſſe with al thy people. Whan Cangins Can was waked out of his ſlepe / he beleued well in ye viſion & forthwith cōmaunded his men yt thei ſholde get thē to horſe for he wolde paſſe the mountayn of Belgian. Than they rode forthe tyll they came to the ſee and there they coulde nat paſſe ouer / bycauſe there was no paſſage greate nor ſmale. And in contynent Cangius Can deſcended from his horſe / and cōmaunded to all his army yt they ſholde lyght and knele downe .ix. tymes towarde the Orient / and yt they ſholde pray to almighty god immortall / that he wolde ſhewe thē the way to paſſe. And all ye nyght Cangius Can & his men abode i prayers. And on the morowe Cā

Belgian he founde moche water mareſe & the lande deſert ſo moche that or he & his people coude come in a good land they ſuffred great penure. After yt they founde gode landes and plentyfull of all thynges wherfore they dwelled in the coūtrey many dayes and repoſed them. And as it pleſed god a gret ſykeneſſe toke Cangius Can and than he cōmaūded to come before hym .xii. ſonnes that he had and cōmaunded them that they ſholde euer be all of one wyll and acorde & gaue theym ſuche example. He cōmaunded that euery one of thē ſholde bringe an arowe. And whā the .xii. ſonnes were com togyder he cōmaunded to his fyrſt ſonne yt he ſholde take all the arowes and that he ſhold breke them with his handes. And ſo his firſt ſonn̄ toke the ſayd arowes but he coude nat breke them with his handes / and than he toke theym to his ſeconde ſonne but he coude nat breke thē. And than Cangius cōmaunded that the arowes ſholde be deꝑted and cōmaunded to the leeſt of his ſonnes yt he ſholde take euery one of the arowes by theymſelfe / and that he ſhold breke them. And thā the chylde brake all the .xii. arowes. And than Cāgius Can torned hym towarde his chyldern & ſayd to them / wherfore coulde you nat breke the arowes as I cōmaūded you / and they ſayde bycauſe that they were all togyder. And than he ſayde wherfore hath this lytell chylde broken them / and they anſwered that bycauſe that he brake them euery one by thēſelfe. Than ſayd Cangius Can it ſhall come ſo by you for as longe as ye ſhalbe all of one wyll & one acorde / your lordſhyps ſhall euer laſt / & whan ye ſhalbe departed one from an other / ſoone after your lordſhipes ſhall torne to nought and ſhal nat contynue. Dyuers more cōmaū

                  gius Can to his chyldren and to his men / which the Tartas kepe yet in great reuerence.
            
            
               ¶How Cangius Can themperour dyed.
               
                  WHan Cangius Can had that done ſeyng yt he coulde nat lyue long he made one of his ſonnes / the beſt & wyſeſt lorde and emperour after hym. And cōmaūded that they all ſholde obey vnto hym and ſerue hym as theyr naturall lorde. And this ſayd ſonne was called Hactoca. After that the good emperour and fyrſt of the Tartas dyed and paſſed out of this worlde / and his ſonne Hoctoca held the lordſhips after hym. And before yt we make an ende of thiſtory of Cāgius Cā we ſhal ſay how the Tartas haue the nōbre of .ix. in great reuerēce and honour / in worſhip of the .ix. knelynges / and of the .ix. fote that the ſee went backe from the cooſt and made way of .ix. fote. Where they paſſed all they mountayn of

Belgyan by the cōmaundemēt of god / the Tartas haue the nōbre of .ix. in great reuerēce. Wherfore he that wyll preſent any thinge to his lorde / and wolde that his preſent ſholde be receyued graciouſly. He muſt preſent the nombre of ix. and ſo is the vſage of the Tartas vnto this day.
            
            
               ¶How Hoctoca Can made war in Aſie.
               
                  HOctoca Can yt was emꝑoure of the Tartas after the deth of his father Cā
                  gius Cā which was valyāt good and wyſe / & alſo his people loued hym well / & were to hym faythfull and true euermore. Hoctoca Can thought to conquere all the lande of Aſie / and before that he deꝑted from the lande ther as he was / he wolde knowe the power of all the kynges that were in Aſie / & wold knowe which was the mooſt puſaunt. Purpoſynge to fyght fyrſt with hym / for he thought that he ſholde lightly ouercome the other if he might cōquer ye mooſt mighty. Thā Hoctoca Can ſend a wiſe and a valiant captayn which was named Gebeſabada / and ſende wt hym .x. thouſande fightynge men and cōmaūded them yt they ſhold entre into the landes of Aſie. And to viewe the ſtate and condicyon of the ſayd lande / and if thei foūd any mighty lorde whom thei wer nat able to reſyſt / they ſhold ſhortly retorne backe agayn. As Hoctoca Can cōmaunded it was acomplyſſhed for ye ſayd captayn wt his x. thouſand Tartas entred ſodē

Or the inhabitauntes were ware / or before that thei coude make them redy to batayle or defende thē / they kylde all the men of armes / but they dyde no harme to the people They toke horſe / harnes / vitayle and all ſuche thynges that they neded / and went ſo farre in the land that they came to the moūtayn of Cocas. For this moūtayn of Cocas one can nat paſſe the depe of Aſie into great Aſie / but by the lycence of the peple of a cyte that the kynge Alexander cloſed vpon a narowe ſee that toucheth the moū
                  tayne of Cocas. This ſayd cytye was taken by theſe .x. thouſande Tartas / in ſuche maner that the inhabytantes of the ſayd cyte had no ſpace nor tyme to defend them ſelfe. And than they toke this cyte and all that was therin / and put all the mē and women to ye 
                  ſwerd And after that they brake downe all the walles of the cyte / bycauſe that whā they ſholde come agayn they ſhold fynde nothing agaynſt them. This cytie was in the olde tyme called Alexander / but nowe it is called porte de ferre. The renowne of the Tartas was ſprede ouer all the countreis and landes wherof it fortuned that the kynge of Georgi which was caled ynaims brought his hooſt togyder &

came agaynſt the tartas & fought with them in a playne that is called Morgam. The batayle laſted longe / but at thende the Georgyens were conſtrayned to fle away as diſcomfyt. The tartas paſſed ſo ferre that they came to a cyte of turkey that is called Arſeon / and than they vnderſtod that the ſowdan of turkey was nere / and how he had aſſembled his hooſt togyder. Therfore the tartas durſt go no farther / ſeynge that they were nat able to encounter agaynſt the ſowdā of turkey / they went backe agayne by an other way to theyr lorde. The which they founde in a cyte that is called Amelect / and tolde hym all that they had done / and founde in the lande of Aſie
            
            
               ¶Whan the tartas lerned fyrſt letters.
               WHan Hoctoca Can vnderſtode the maner & condicyon of the lande of Aſie. He thought that there was no prynce that was able to withſtand hym. And than he called thre ſonnes yt he had / and gaue them great ryches with a great nombre of men of armes. And cōmaūded them to entre into the lande of Aſie / conquering all the realmes & landes. And cōmaunded to his ſon̄ Iochi that he ſholde go toward the parties of Occident vnto the flode of Phyſon. And to his ſecond ſonne that was called Bacho he cōmaū
                  ded that he ſhold kepe his way towarde Septētrion / and to ye leeſt that was called Chaſada cōmaū
                  ded that he ſholde ryde toward ye South. In this maner he departed his thre chyldren and ſend thē for to conquer theſe landes & prouynces. After that Hoctoca Can ſprede his hooſt abrode by ye coū
                  treis / ſo moche that the fore fronte of his hooſt rought to the realme of Cathay / & the other front to the realme of Traſe. In thoſe partes the tartas lerned leters / for before that tyme thei had no letters and therfore the dwellers of the ſayde coūtrey were all ydolatours. The tartas began to honour the ydols but many of them confeſſed ye immortall god gretter than ye other. ¶After that themꝑour Hoctoca Can gaue to his eldeſt ſonne that was called Bacho .xxx. thouſande tartas that were called Tanachy that is to ſay conquerers / and cō
                  maunded that they ſhold go that way yt the .x. thouſād tartas kept and yt they ſhold tary in no lande tyll they ſholde come into ye realm of Turky / & more ouer he cōmaū
                  ded yt thei ſhold proue if thei wer able to fyght agaynſt the ſowdan of Turky / & if that they dyde ſe yt the ſowdans power wer to great they ſholde nat fyght wt hym / but they ſholde do ſo moche to one of his chyldren which ſholde be next them yt he wolde gyue them helpe and men of warr. And than after they met began the batayle of Bacho wt .xxx. thouſand tartas went ſo moche by theyr iourneis yt they

came to the realme of Turkey / & there he vnderſtode that the ſowdan that had dryued away the .x.M. tartas was deed. After hym one of his ſon̄es yt was called Giriacadyn was made lorde. this ſodan was in great fere for the tartas cōmynge / and than he gathered and waged all maner of men that he coude haue as Barbarins and Latyns / yt had two captayns of the which one was called Iohn de la limynate / which was of the ple of Cipre. And ye other was called Bonyface de moulins / and he was of the cyte of Venyſe.

He came & fought with the tartas in a place that is called Aſadache / the batell was grete and many men ſlain of bothe parties / but at the laterend the tartas had ye victory / & entred into the landes of Turky & cōquered the ſayd landes. In the yer of our lorde god .M.CC.xliii. And than nat longe tyme after Hoctoca Can themꝑour of the tartas dyed. And after hym one of his ſonnes was made lorde / which was called Guyot Cā / this Guyot Cā lyued nat long after hym. One of his coſyns was made lord which was called Māgo Can / ye which was moche valyant & wyſe & conquered many landes & lordſhips / but at the ende as a man that hath a great hert he entred vpon ye ſee. And as he layde ſege to an yle the which he wold haue takē by ye ſee ſyde. The men of that lande that were ſubtyll ſend for men yt

And ſo was Māgo Cā themꝑour of the tartas drowned / his mē went home agayn & made his brother lorde yt was called Cobila Can / the which kept the lordſhip of the tartas .xlii. yeres. And made them chriſten men & cloſed a cyte which is called Ioing / yt is gretter than Rhome. And in this cytie dwelled Cobila Can which was the .v. emꝑour of the tartas tyll the laſt ende of his dayes. We ſhall leue to ſpeke of Māgo Can and ſhall retorne to ſpeke of Hoctoca Cans chyldren of Halcon of his heyres and of his warkes.

               WHan Halcō had refreſſhed hym the ſpace of an yer and his men in the cite of Rohais. He ſende for the kyng of Armeni that he ſholde come to hym / for he was diſpoſed to go and delyuer ye holy lande & to reſtore it agayne into ye chriſten mens handes. The kyng of gode remēbraūce was full glad of the ſayd cōmaūdement & gathered a gret hooſt of valyant men a fote & a horſbacke. For in ye tyme the realme of Armeny was iproſperyte ſo yt he made .xii. thouſāde horſmen / and .xii. thouſand afote and that haue I ſene in my dayes Whan the kynge of Armeny was come he helde a parlyment & coū

And ſyth yt ye entende to go to the holy land me thinke it for ye beſt to lay ſege firſt to the cyte of Halap / which is the mooſt ſtrongeſt cyte in the realm of Syrie. For if we may take the cyte of Halap all the other may be lightly takē. Halcon was well pleaſed with the kynge of Armenis counſell. And than he layd ſege to the cyte of Halap / which had full ſtrong walles / but the tartas toke the cytye by mynes that they had made vnder the grounde / and by other craft and ingins that they dyde make / they toke the cytie byforce in nyne dayes. But there was within the cytie a caſtell that was ſo ſtronge that it defended them that wer within a leuen dayes after that they had take ye cytie Great haboundaunce of riches & other ſubſtaunce founde the tartas Whan they were entred withī the cytie of Halape. And ſo Halap was taken / and after that all the realme of Syrie.

Whan the ſoudan of Halap that was at that tyme in the cytie of Damas vnderſtod that the cytie of Halap was taken by the tartas. And that they had taken his wyfe and his chyldren / he knewe nat what to do / but yeld hym ſelfe to the mercy of Halcon thynkinge by that mean that Halcon ſholde render to hym his wyfe and his chyldren and parte of his lande. Than Halcon dyde ſend the ſowdan his wyfe and his chyldren to the realme of Perſy bycauſe that he might be ye more ſurer of hym.

And alſo he gaue hym of his lādes and caſtels that he had conquered / and ſpecially dyuers that were nygh to the realme of Armenie. And after the kinge furnyſſhed the caſtels with his men. Than after that Halcon dyd ſend for the prince of Antioch which was the kyng of Armenes ſonne / and dyde hym great grace and honour. And dyde gyue hym all the landes and lordſhips that he had taken from the ſaraſyns.
               After that Halcon had ordayned all that was nedefull about the cytie of Halap / Damaſſe / and the other landes the which they had conquered and taken from the ſaraſyns. As he had thought to entred into the realme of Hieruſalē for to delyuer the holy lande vnto the chriſten men agayne. There came a meſſangere to hym and brought hym worde that his brotheh was deed and paſſed oute of this worlde / & how the barownes fought for to haue made hym emperour.

And by the coūſayle of his mē he went away & left one of his barownes that was called Garboga with .x. thouſande tartas / for to kepe the realme of Syrie. And cōmaunded that all the landes that had ben in the eſtriſtē mens handꝭ ſholde be reſtored agayne. After that he went toward the Orient / and left one of his ſō

And than the deuyll put great trouble betwene hym & the chriſten men yt were of the partes of Saiect. For in the lande of Belfort that was of the lordſhyp of Saiect was diuers townes in the which the ſaraſyns dwelled & payd a tribute to ye Tartas wherof it came that the men of Saiect and of Belfort came togyder to make a courſe and robed the ſayd townes frome the ſayd ſaraſyns / ſome were ſlayne / and ſome were brought pryſoners. One of Ginbogas neuiewes was in that coū

Some of the chriſten men ranne vpon hym and ſo kylde hym. whā Ginboga vnderſtode that ye chriſten men of Saiect had ſlayn his neuiewe. He rode with his men & came to Sarepte / and as many chriſten men as he founde put thē to the ſwerde / but ye peple of Sarepte wente away in the yle & but fewe ſlayne / Ginboga dyde putte fyre in the cyte and brake the walles and neuer ſythe Ginboga had neuer truſt nor loue with the chriſten men of Syrie nor his men. After that the Tartas were dryuen oute of the realme of Syrie / by ye power of the ſowdā of Egipt As it ſhalbe declared here after.

In a place that is called Haymelot and ther he fought with the Tartas / but they coude nat abyde the ſowdans power & ſo they fled backe with theyr captayns. It was ſayd that Gynboga was ſlayne in the batayle / the Tartas that ſcaped from the ſaid batayle went into Armenie. At ye tyme the realme of Syrie torned to the ſowdans power / but ſome cytes that were by the ſee that the chriſten men kept.

And than the ſaraſyns entred in the lande & waſted all the playn of Armeny. The chriſtēmens power was moch minyſhed bycauſe of that / & the puytaunce of the ſaraſyns power was moche enhaunced. Whan ye kyng of Armeny vnderſtod this tidynges of his ſonnes and of the lande he was moch ſorowfull & thought in his mynde how yt he myght do harme to his ennemys.

                  WHan Mahomet had his neuiewe vnder his power he delyuerd hym to one of his conſtables for to kepe. And after ordained that his men ſhulde come ſoftly after hym and he hȳ ſelfe wolde go towarde Thoris / there as he had lefte his wyfe. And commaūded to the cō
                  ſtable that he ſhulde ſecretly kyll his neuiewe Argon / and that he ſhulde bryng hȳ his heed to Thoris. A great myghty man founde hym / yt which Argons father had noryſſhed and done moche good to hym. This ſayd man had gret py
                     •
                  e vpon Argon / and than vpon a nyght came and ſlewe the conſtable / and all them that were of his company. And delyuerd Argon from dethe and out of pryſon and made Argon lord ouer them all / and to hym they were obeyd
                     •
                  
                  ent and redy to do hym ſeruyce. Whan this was done Argō rydde haſtely and dyde ſo moche that he ouertoke Mahomet Can or yt he came to Thoris / and incontynently he cutte hym all in peces. And after this maner the curſed dogge Mahomet fyniſſhed his lyfe / the ſeconde yere of his reygne.
               ¶In the yere of our lorde god a thowſande two honderde .lxxxv. After yt Mahomet was deed Argon was made lorde of the Tartas and the great emperour confermed hym in his lordſhip / and wolde that he ſhulde be called Argon Can. And bycauſe of that Argon was moch more worſhipped than any of his aūcytours. This Argon was fayre and pleſaunt of viſage and a ſtorng man of body and kept his lordſhyppe wyſely. He gouerned well his lordſhippe and he loued well and honoured moch the chriſtēmen. And ye churches

of the chriſtēmen that Mahomet brake downe / Argon cauſed thē to be newe made agayn. And than came to hym the kyng of Armeny / the kyng of Georgy / and ye other chriſtēmen of the Orient / & prayed Argon that he wolde take payne to delyuer the holy lande. Wherupon Argon toke aduyſmēt entendyng to make peace fyrſt wt his neyghbours / to thyntent that he myght go the more ſurer agaynſt the ſowdans power. And as it happened that Argon was in yt good purpoſe. In the fourth yere of his raygne / as it pleaſed god he dyed. And one of his brethern yt was called Kalgato was made lorde after hym. This ſayd Kalgato was the vnprofitablyſt lord that euer reygned in that coūtrey ſith Cāgius Can was made lord as it ſhalbe reherſed here after.
            
            
               ¶How Kalgato was drowned by his owne people.
               IN the yere of our lorde god M.CC.lxxxix. After ye deth of Argon Can his brother Kalga to helde the lordſhip. This ſayde Kalgaro beleued nat well / nor he was nothyng worth ī armes / but demeaned hym ſelfe lyke a foule beeſt / in etyng of denteth meres & drinkynge of ſwete wynes to fyll his belly. Non other thȳg dyd he in .vi. yerꝭ whyle he kept his lordſhippe. For the great peuiſſhneſſe that was in hym his owne people began to hate hym & to diſprayſe hym / and ſo at the ende his owne peple drowned hym. After ye deth of this Kalgato one of his coſyns was mad 
                  lord / which was called Baydo. This ſayd Baido was a gode chriſtēmā / & dyd moch good to the chriſtēmen but he lyued nat longe in this worlde.
               ¶After the deth of Kalgato Baydo had the lordſhip of his brother This man as a good chriſtēman cauſed the churches of the chriſtē
                  men to be buylded vp agayn / and cōmaūded that none ſhulde prech the lawe of Mahomet in his lāde. Of yt the ſaraſyns that were multyplied were ſore greued. and thā the ſaraſyns & the tartas ſend pryuely / to Conſan meſſāges which was Argons ſonne / & promyſed hym yt they wold make hym lord & that they ſhulde gyue hym Baydos lordſhip if he wolde forſake ye chriſten fayth. Caſan that ſet nat moche by the fayth of Chriſt was lightly torned / for he was moche couytus to haue the lordſhip / and was content to do after theyr deſyre. Wherupon Cōſan roſe / than Baydo gathered his hooſt & cam agaynſt Conſan / and knewe nat the treaſon of his people.
            
            
               ¶How Caſan was deceyued by the traytour Chapchap.
               WHan Baydo thought to come agaynſt Cō
                  ſan all they that kept Mahometz law deꝑted & wēt towarde

Caſan. Whan Baydoſe yt his men had betrayed hym he torned backe agayn / but Caſan ſend after and toke him & ſo as Baydo fledde away he was kylde & than Caſan toke the lordſhippe.
               ¶After Baydos deth Caſā kept the lordſhip he ſhewed hym ſelfe moch proude to the chriſtēmen / & that dyde he for the pleaſure of thē that had put him in the lordſhip aboue ſayd but ſyth yt he was fermed in his lordſhyp. He began to loue moch the chriſtēmen & hated the ſaraſyns / & he dyde moch profet to the chriſten lande. Fyrſte he put to dethe all them that gaue hȳ counſell to do hurt to the chriſtenmen. After that Caſan cōmaūded that all his men ſhulde be redy wt
                  in a yere / of all maner of thynges that they had

                     ed to. For he wold entre into the land of Egypt and put out the ſowdan / and ſende to the kyng of Armeny / to the kyng of Georgy / and to the chriſtēmen of the parties of the Orient / that they ſhulde be redy to come with hym. Whan the ſeaſon was come Caſan rode with all his power & came into the cytie of Baldache. Whan Caſan came into the ſowdans landes / he brought his men togyder. The ſowdan of Egypt that was called Malecuaſer gathered all his power before the cytie of Hames / that is in the myddes of the realme of Syrie. Caſan vnderſtode that the ſowdan was cōmyng for to fyght agaynſt hym. And for cauſe of yt he wolde nat tary / for to take caſtell / nor towne / but he went ſtreight to the place there as the ſowdan was / & lodged by the hooſt / within a dayes iourney. In a medowe wherin was great plenty of graſſe / than Caſan cōmaūded that thei ſhulde gyue reſt to all their beeſtes / that wer laboured in commyng haſte lye ſo ferre way. In the company of Caſan was a ſaraſyn that was called Chapchap / whiche had ben baylie of Damas and was fledde away for fere of the ſoudā. Caſan had don many honours & graces to the ſaid Chapchap and truſted hym well. And than it happened that the ſayd Chapchap / ſende by his letters to ye ſowdan of Egypt all the ſecrettes and counſell of the Tartas / and ſende to the ſowdan that he ſhulde come haſtely agaynſt Caſan to the batayle. And as his men and his beeſtes were wery / than it fortuned that the ſowdan of Egypt / which dyd purpoſlye tary for Caſan / went into the countreys of Hames by the counſell of the ſayd Chapcha the traytoure. And came haſtely with all his power to begynne vpon Caſan / and to make hym a frayed. The kepers of Caſās hooſt gaue knowlege of the ſowdās cōmyng And than Caſan commaūded to all his barownes that they ſhulde ryde all in ordre ī theyr batayles / againſt the ſowdan and his men / and Caſan rode euer with as many of his men yt were by him / and

came agaynſt the ſowdan which came haſtely with a great nombre of the beeſt men of his hooſt. Whan Caſan ſe that he coude nat vndertake the tayle & that his mē that were abrode coude nat come to hym ſo ſoone. He taryed there & cōmaunded to all them that were with hym that they ſhulde lyght a fote / and that they ſhuld put theyr horſes about them. And with bowes and arowes they ſhulde bete theyr ennemys downe / that were cōmyng & rōnyng as faſt as theyr horſes coud bere them / than ye tartas deſcended afore and put theyr horſes betwene them / & held their bowes and theyr arowes redy in theyr handes / abydinge tyll theyr ennemys were come nere to them Than the tartas ſhot theyr arowes all togyder and made thē that came rōnynge fyrſt to fall vpon ye grounde / and the other that came after fyll vpon them / and ſo ye one fyll vpon an other. And they ſhot ſtyll and well for they were good ſhoters / ſo that fewe of ye ſaraſins ſkaped / but yt they were ſlayne or hurt. Whan the ſowdan ſe that he went backe agayne. And thā Caſan commaunded incōtinently to his men that they ſholde lepe vpō theyr horſes / and that they ſhulde valiantly ſet vpon their ennemys Caſan was the fyrſt that went to fyght agaynſt ye ſowdan and ran into the preſe with ſuche ſmall cō
                  pany that he had with hym tyll all the barownes came to the batayle Than began the batayle that laſted from the ſon̄ riſing tyll none / at thende the ſowdans hooſt coud nat endure afore Caſan. For with his owne handꝭ he dyd gret meruelles / & the ſowdan with his people fledde away. Caſan and his mē chaſed them tyll it was darke nyght / and they ſlewe as many of theyr ennemys as they coud take Than ther was ſo many ſaraſȳs ſlayne that the groūde was all couered with them. The ſayd night Caſā taryed in a place that is called Caner / full gladde of the victory that god had giuen hym. This batayle was / in ye yere of our lord god a thouſāde thre hondred and one / the wedniſday before Chriſtmaſſe.
            
            
               ¶How the cytie of Hames was conquered.
               
                  AFter that Caſan commaūded to the kynge of Armeni and to one of his barownes that was called Molay / that with forty thouſande Tartas they ſholde go after the ſowdan vnto the deſert of Egipt that was well twelfe dayes iourney from ye place there as the batayle was / and cōmaunded that they ſhuld tary his commyng in the countrey of Caſſore. The kynge of Armeny & Molay with .xl.M. tartas deꝑted & went after the ſowdan / & as many ſaraſyns as they coude take they kyld them. The thyrd day after Caſan cōmaunded that the kynge of Armeni

ſhuld cōe backe again for he wold lay ſege to ye cyte of Hames & cōmaūded ye Molay ſhulde go after ye ſowdan. But ye ſowdā ran away nyght & day vpon cōnynge horſes / in the cōpany of Bednyns that were his gyde. And ī this maner myſerably the ſowdan entred into Babylon without any cōpany / the ſaraſyns fledde away into dyuers wodes ther as they thought to ſkape better. & a great part of the Saraſins kept the way towarde Triple the which were taken & kylde by the chriſtēmen that dwelled at the mount of Lyban. The kynge of Armeny retorned to Caſan and found that the cyte of Hames was yelded to Caſan / and all the riches that the ſowdan and his men had was brought be fore Caſan. And they marueyled greatly all that the ſowdan & his men had brought with thē ſo gret riches ther as they though to feyght. Whan Caſan had brought to gyder all the treſure & riches that wer goten he deꝑted all to his mē And I fere Hayton hath ben preſent to all the great beſineſſe that the tartas had to do with the ſaraſyns. From Halcons tyme hyderto / but I herd neuer ſpeke that no lorde of the tartas dyde ſo great a dede in two dayes as Caſā dyde. For the fyrſt day of ye batayle Caſan with a ſmale company of men proued hymſelfe agaynſt the ſowdan & a great nōbre of his men / & of his perſon dyde ſowell that he was named aboue all other in batayle / & of his perſon ſhalbe ſpokē among the tartas euermore. The ſecond day the fredome of Caſan was great for all ye riches that he had gotē that was wtout nombre he deꝑted it to his men in ſuch maner / that he kept for hym ſelfe but one ſwerd & a purſe of ledderfull of writinges & dedes of the lande of Egypt. And all the remnant he gaue frely / & marueyll it was yt ſo lytell a body myght haue ſo great vertu for among a .M. men coud nat be ſo ſklēder a man nor ſo euyl mad nor a fouler mā / he ſurmoū
                  ted all other in proweſſe & vertue. And for bycauſe that Caſan is of our tyme we muſt ſpeke of hym lē
                  ger than of the other / for this ſowdan that was ouercome by Caſan is yet lyuenge. And moreouer all them that tary the paſſage of the holy lande may take there many good examples.
            
            
               ¶How they of Damas yelded them ſelfe to Caſan.
               AFter ye Caſā had reſted certain dayes & ordred his beſineſſes he rode to the cyte of Damas. whā they of Damas vnderſtode the cōmynge of Caſan they wer afrayed / for if Caſan ſholde take thē by force / he ſhuld take all without any mercy. And thā they ſende theyr meſſangers to Caſan with great giftes and ſende to hȳ the keys of the towne of Damas. Than it happened that Caſan receyued the gyftes / & cōmaūded to

the meſſangers that they ſhuld retorn to Damas. And yt thei ſhuld make vitayle redy for his hooſt & that they ſhuld nat fere his commyng / for he wolde do no hurt to the cite of Damas / but wold kepe it as his chābre. The meſſangers deꝑted full gladde for ye good anſwere yt Caſan gaue thē. And thā Caſan rod after & lodged nere the riuer of Damas / & cōmaunded yt no man ſhuld hurt nor oppres the cyte. They of Damas ſend to Caſan great gyftes & habondaunce of vitayle for him & his hooſt / and ſo Caſan ſoiorned many dayes in Damas with his hooſt beſydde ye xl.M. tartas that wer with Molay / the which wer at Acaſere tarieng for Caſās comyng. As Caſan and his people taryed & repoſed them at Damas / there came a meſſāger that brought tidyngꝭ yt Baydo was entred into ye realme of Perſy / & that he had don̄ moch harme in ye lande / & they thought he ſholde do more hurt thā he had done. wherfore Caſan cōmaūded to Catholaſa yt he ſholde tary for to kepe ye realme of Syri / and cō
                  maūded to Molay and to ye other tartas that wer wt hym in Caſere that thei ſhold obey to Catholaſa yt which Caſā had laft in his plac And than after he ordayned baylies & gouerners in euery cyte / and made Cachap baylie of Damaſſe Caſan vnderſtode nat ye Cachap was a traytour. After all that Caſan called the kynge of Armeny & ſhewed hym how he wold retorn̄ to Perſy. Caſan ſayd we haue delyuerd you the lande of Syrie to kepe for ye chriſtēmen if they come we leue our cōmaūdement to Catholaſa yt he ſhall delyuer the holy lande to ye chriſtēmen & yt he ſhuld gyue coūſell & helpe to make ye lā
                  des agayn. whan Caſā had done that he went toward Meſopotamy & whan he was at the flode of Eufrates. He cōmaunded to Catholaſa that he ſhold leue Molay with .xx.M. men to kepe the land & that he ſhold come in all the haſt to hym wt the remnāt of the hooſt / of the kyng Anyne of Meſopotamy. And ſo Catholaſa departed & dyde as Caſan cōmaūded hym / & Molay taried for to kepe ye lande of Syri / by ye coūſell of the traitor Capchap. Molay wēt into the ꝑties of Hieruſalē into a place that is called Gant wher was gode paſtur for their horſes. whan the ſō
                  mer was com Capchap ſend his meſſangers to the ſowdan & ꝓmyſed to delyuer hym Damas / & all the other landꝭ that ye tartas kept of the realme of Syri. And ye ſowdan promiſed to Capchap that he ſhold gyue hym ye lordſhip of Damas / & a great part of his treſure and his ſyſter to be his wyfe / than Capchap roſe and made to ryſſe all the countres for he knewe well yt the tartas coud nat come vpon them bycauſe of the great hete of the ſōmer Whanne Molay ſe that Damas & the other coūtreis wer vp he durſte nat abyde in the realme of Syrie with ſo fewe men / 

but went towarde Meſopotamy and there he found Caſan and reherſed to hym what Capchap the traytour had done. Whan Caſan vnderſtod thoſe tydinges he was greatly diſpleaſed but he coud no remedy for the great here yt was there. Whan the ſōmer was paſte and the wynter began Caſan gathared a great hooſt vpon ye flode ſyde of Eufrates and ſende firſte for Catholaſa with .xxx. thouſāde tartas. And cōmaunded that they ſhold go toward the cyte of Antioche / and that he ſhold ſende for ye kynge of Armeny and for the chriſtēmen that wer at that tyme in realme of Cipres / and ſo they came by the ſee to the cyte of Corcoſe / & there was the lorde Sut brother to the kyng of Cipres / which conducted the lordes and knyghtes / and ther was the maiſters of the temple and of the hoſpitall. And as they wer apparelled to do our lorde god ſeruice tydingꝭ came yt a ſore ſykeneſſe had taken Caſan. Wherfore Catholaſa was fayn to retorne to Caſan with his men / & the kyng retourned to his coūtrei And the chriſtēmen that wer com to ye yle of Carcon went to Ciprez & for this cauſe ye 
                  warr of the holy lande was laſt. This mater was in the yere of our lorde a thouſāde thre honderde and one.
            
            
               ¶Whan the kynge of Armeny & Catholaſa toke ye cyte of Hames.
               IN the yere of our lorde god M.CCC. & .iii. Caſan gathared his hooſt agayn vpon the flodde of Eufrates to thentent yt he myght enter into the realme of Siri / and to diſtroy ye ſowdan of Egipt. And to recouer ye holy lāde and delyuer it to the chriſtēmen agayne. Whan the ſaraſyns vnderſtode the cōmynge of Caſan and that they were nat able to fyght agaynſt his power / they waſted & brende all the lande and countrey by they which thei ſholde paſſe wt theyr beeſtes and catell & all that they coude fynde the brought to a ſtronge place and all they remnāt they ſette on fyre / for cauſe yt theyr horeſs ſholde fynde name at. whā Caſan vnderſtode this that the ſaraſyns had done / thinkynge that the horſes ſhold fynde no mete to lyue on. He toke counſell to tary ye ſame wīter at ye flode of Eufrates And whan the graſſe ſhold begyn to ſpringe they wolde take theyr waye / but they had more thought for their horſes mete thā they dyd for themſelfe as men but of ſmale fedynge. Caſan was vpon ye 
                  flod ſyde with his hooſt and ſende for the kyng of Armeni. Caſās hooſt was ſo grete that it laſted .iii. dayes iourney of length. From the caſtell yt is called Racale to another that is called la Bire / theſe two caſtels wer longing to the ſaraſyns but they yelded them to Caſā and as Caſan was tarieng at the flod of Eufrates for the ſeſon & wether forto delyuer the holy land out of

the ſaraſyns power he herd tidȳ
                  ges that Baydo was come agayn into his lande / and how he hadde done moche harme there / and dryuen his men away that he left ther forto kepe ye lande / vpon that Caſan had counſell that he ſhulde retorne into his countrey. And in ye next yere he might well entre into the realme of Syrie. Caſan was ſore diſpleaſed that the mater of ye holy lande taryed ſo long. Than he cōmaunded to Catholoſa that he ſhulde entre into the realme of Syrie with .xl. thouſande tartas and that he ſhulde take the cyte of Damas / and that he ſhuld put to the ſwerde as many as he ſhulde take. And cōmaunded to the king of Armeny that he ſhulde go with his men with Catholoſa with .xl. thouſand Tartas on horſbacke & that they ſhulde entre into the realme of Syrie / and as they ſhuld go to waſt all the countrey. They had thought to haue found the ſodan in that countrey as they had done in tymes paſt / but they foūd hym nat but they herd ſay that he was at Gazette. And that he wold nat departe out of that countrey. Wherfore Catholoſa and ye kinge of Armeny dyd aſſayle & ſet vpon the cyte of Hames / ſo well that wt in fewe dayes they toke it byforce and put all the men and womē to the ſwerd wtout any mercy. Thei founde there great ryches & great plenty of beeſtes & vitayles. And after that they went before ye cytie of Dames / to thintent to ſet vpon it. But the burges of the cyte deſyred them that they ſhuld gyue thē terme for thre dayes / and after yt they ſhulde yelde them to mercy. The terme was graūted to them but ronners made a courſe from the tartas hooſt well a dayes iourney be ende Damas / & toke a certayne nombre of ſaraſyns whiche they ſende to Catholoſa their captayn. And by thoſe ſaraſyns Catholoſa knewe that within .ii. dayes iourney from thens were .xii. thouſande ſaraſyns on horſbacke taryeng for the ſowdans cōmyng Whan Catholoſa vnderſtod this tidynges he rode haſtely & dyde ſo moche that he came to the place ther as the .xii. thouſande ſaraſīs wer to euynſong tyme / thinkyng to ouertake thē or ye ſowdan ſhuld come. But a lytell whyle before ye ſowdā was come with his power Whan Catholoſa and the king of Armeny ſe that the ſowdan was come they toke counſell what they ſhulde do / and bycauſe it was almooſt nyght they had counſell to reſt them. And vpon the next day they ſhuld ſet wyſely vpon ye ſowdan / but Catholoſa that dſpirayſed the ſowdan wolde nat tary ſo longe. But cōmaūded that his mē ſhulde take corage / and that valyantly they ſhuld ſet vpon theyr ennemys. The ſaraſyns yt were lodged in a ſtrong place betwene .ii. waters / wold nat depart to fyght for they knewe well that ye tartas coude nat come to them without great loſſe. And bycauſe of that ye
                  
ſaraſyns wolde nat departe from thens / ye tartas rode haſtely to ſet vpō their ēnemys / but thei foūd a lytel water yt they coude nat paſſe in dyuers places that troubled thē moch or they coude paſſe the ſayd water whan Catholoſa the kyng of Armeny / and the mooſt part of theyr men was paſſed they ſet valiantly vpon theyr enenmys / thei kylde all them yt they met in theyr way and chaſed them tyll yt nyght the ſowdan wolde nat come from his place nor come to the batayle. That night Catholoſa lodged by a moūtayn with his mē except .x.M. that coude nat paſſe ye water by day lyght. Than the next day Catholoſa ordayned his men for to fyght / but the ſowdan wold nat come out of that place nor come to ye batayle. The tartas toke moch labour forto haue ye ſaraſyns out of that place / but they coude nat in no wyſe. The batayle laſted tyll none / but for faute of water ye tartas were wery & went backe forto fynde water. And went in order one after an other tyll they cam to the playne of Damas / and there they founde paſture and water I nough. And Catholoſa ordayned to reſt his mē and his horſes a certayne whyle there / bycauſe yt they ſhulde be the freſſher forto retorne & fyght agaynſt the ſowdan. Whā the tartas hooſt was lodged in ye playne and thought to be in reſt / the men of Damas lette ronne the water of the fludde by cundittes and dyches / ſo moche that or .viii. of the clocke in the mornynge the playne was all couered with water and the wayes. Wherfore the Tartas wer fayne to ryſe haſtely and alſo the nyght was darke the diches and the wayes were al full of water. Wherfore the hooſt was in great confuſyon horſe / beeſtes / and harnes were loſt / and many men drowned to great loſſe. Thā the day come and ſo they were delyuerd by the grace of god out of that daunger / but the bowes and the arowes / wherof the Tartas occupyed ye mooſt in batayle wer ſo weyt that they cound nat helpe them therwith. In this maner the Tartas hooſt were ſore troubled that yf the ſaraſyns had come ſodaynly vpon thē they might haue ouercome them. The tartas begā to go backe agayne ſoftly bycauſe of theyr horſes loſt / & came i.viii. dayes iourney to the fludde of Eufrates they were fayne to paſſe ouer vpon theyr horſes / the beſte yt they coude do. The flud was gret and depe ſo moche that many Georgyns / and tartas were loſt ther And ſo the Tartas went backe agayne to theyr cōfuſyon nat for ye power of their ēnemys / but by euyll coūſell / for Catholoſa myght auoyded all that myſcheffe if he wolde haue beleued good coūſell.
            
            
               ¶How the kynge of Armeny went to Caſan.
               I Frere Hayton that maketh mencion of this hiſtory was

preſent. And if I haue ſpoken to long of this mater I pray you ꝑdon me / for I haue done it to the entent to put of the daungers. In lyke mater for the warkes that be done by counſell ought for to haue good ende. After that the kyng of Armeny had paſſed the fludde of Eufrates / nat wtout great labour & loſſe of his men. He toke coūſell to go ſe Caſan or he ſhuld go into Armeny. Than the king toke his way & went ſtreyght to the cyte of Ninyue ther as Caſā dwelled at that tyme Caſan receyued ye king honorably / & had pyte of the grete loſſe that he had of his men. And for bycauſe that the king of Armeny & his men had ſerued truely in all theyr beſyneſſes Caſan dyde a ſpeciall grace to the kyng. For he gaue hym a .M. tartas that were good horſmen / & cōmaunded that thei ſhuld dwell ther forto kepe ye lande of Armeny to the kynge of Turkes coſt / tyll that he ſhuld be able to gyue wages to a .C. other knightes to his wyll. After that ye kynge toke his leue at Caſan and went into his coūtrey. and Caſan ſayde to hym ſe that ye kepe your land well tyll yt I ſhall come ꝑſonably forto recouer ye holy lande.
            
            
               ¶How the ſowdan made trewſe with the kyng of Armeny.
               THe kyng of Armeny retorned into his countrey / but ſyth his cōmynge ther he had but lytell reſt. For the ſowdan ſend in the ſame yere almooſt euery moneth a great nōbre of men a warr that ran almooſt all ye lande of Armeny / & waſted all ye playn. wherfore the realme of Armeny was worſe than euer it was before / but god almighty that is with them that ſerue hym / had mercy of ye peple & chriſtēmen of Armeny. wherof it happened that in the moneth of Iuly .vii.M. ſaraſyns of the beſt of the ſowdā of Egiptz houſe entred into the realme of Armeni & ronned all the playn waſtyng & robbing to the cyte of Terſot. In the which ſaynt Paule was borne This ennemys dyde moche hurt / and as they were goynge backe agayne. The kyng of Armeny gathered his hooſt / & met with them & nygh the cyte of Layas was the batayle. And by the grace of oure lorde god theyr ennemys were ouercome / in ſuche maner that of ye vii.M. ſaraſyns ſkaped nat .iii. hondred / but they wer ſlayn or taken. And that was vpon a ſonday the .viii. day of Iuly / & after that batayle they durſt nomore come ī the realme of Armeny. But the ſodan ſende & made trueſe with the king of Armeni. And I frere Hayton maker of this warke was preſent to this thinges / & longe tyme afore yt I was purpoſed to take ye order of relygiō. But I coud nat for the great beſineſſe yt the kyng of Armeny had at yt tyme. I coud nat for myne honour forſake my lordes and my frendꝭ in all nedis but ſith god of his grace hath gyuen

vs the victory agaynſt our ennemys. And alſo gyuen grace to leue the realme of Armeny in ſuffycient good ſtate / ſhortly after I thought forto make an end of my bowe. And than I toke leue of the kyng & of my kynred & frendes / & in that tyme yt our lorde gaue vs the victory agaynſt the ennemys of our fayth. I toke my way & cā ī to Egipt & ther into our lady Delepiſcopie chirch of ye order of Premontrey / I toke the abyte of relygion & longe I had ben knyght in this world to thyntent forto ſerue god the remenaūt of my lyfe. And this was in the yere of our lorde god. M.CCC.v. grace & mercy to god / for the realme of Armeny is reformed in better ſtate than it was by the yonge kinge my lorde Lynon in the old tyme baron the which is full of vertue and grace. And alſo we truſt yt in this yonge kyng of Armenys dayes. The realm of Armeni ſhalbe in his gode firſt ſtate wt the helpe of our lorde Iheſu Chriſt.

For from the begynnyng of Cangius Can / that was the firſt emperour of the tartas / tyll Mango Can that was the forth emperour. I ſe all as ye Tartas hiſtoris reherſed. And from Mango Can tyl Halcō dyed I ſpeke as I haue herde and lerned of my lorde myn vncle the kyng Hayton / the kyng of Armeny which hath ben preſēt in great dilygence reherſed to his ſonnes and to his neuewes / & dyd vs put in writynge for a remembraunce.

               ¶Of the thre kynges that dyd honour to the great emperour.
               
                  THe great emꝑour of ye tartas yt kept the lord ſhype is called Tamor Cann which was the vi. emperour & held his ſege in the realme of Catay in a cyte that is called Iunig / the which his father foūded. The myght of this emperour is great for hym ſelfe alone might do mor than all the tartas princes / themperours men be takē for more noble / more riches / and more garniſſhed of all thingꝭ than others. For in the realme of Catay is a great haboundaunce of riches. And after the .iii. kynges of Tartas that haue a great power / and do all reuerence

to the great emꝑour / and obedient by his Iugement. The firſt of theſe kynges is called Tapar / the ſeconde Totay / and the thyrde Tarbanda. Tarpar held the lordſhip of Turkeſten and is more nygh of themperours landꝭ than the others / this kynge may bringe with hym in batayle .iiii.C. thouſand men of warr an horſbacke / this men be valyant & hardy / thei haue gode harnis / & gode horſes. Somtymes themperour maketh warr againſt Chapchap & wolde take his landes from him but he defended hym valyantly. The lordſhippe of Capar was all vnder one lorde how beit that his brother Totay helde a great part of his lande.
               ¶Totay the kynge of the tartas helde the kyng of Cumanys lordſhip and his ſege in a cytie that is called Sarra. This prynce may bring to the batayle .vii.C. thouſande men an horſbacke as ye ſayeng is / but they be nat ſo valyant in batayle and ī dede of armes as Capars men be. How be it yt they haue better harnes / & better horſes. Somtyme they make warre agaynſt Carbāda / ſomtyme they make warr agaynſt the kynge of Bulgarie / ſōtyme they haue war amonge them. But nowe Totay kepeth the lordſhip in reſt & peas.
            
            
               ¶How they of Lices haue know lege by birdes whan any of theyr ennemys be cōmyng toward thē.
               CArbāda held his power in the great Aſie and kept his ſege in ye cite of Toris / he may bring to the batayle about .iii.C. thouſande men of armes an horſbacke / but they be men of dyuerſe nations / rych and well furniſſhed of all maner ſuche thinges as thei haue nede. Capar & Totay make warre often tymes agaynſt Carbanda / but he defended his lande wiſely. Carbanda medled nat wt no warre agaynſt no man but the Turke of Egypt / to the which all his aunceſtours haue had warre with the aboue ſayd princes. Tapar and Totay wold fayne putte Carbanda out of his lordſhip yf thei coud / but thei haue no might How beit yt they be more mighty of men and of landes / this is ye reſon how Carbanda defended his landes from the myght of his neybours. For Aſie is deuyded in .ii. partes / the one parte is called the depe Aſie / the other is called the maior Aſie. And in that part Carbanda dwelled there is no more but thre wayes by the which they may entre out of Aſie the ꝓfonde / and Aſie the great. The one way is by the which thei go from ye realme of Turqueſten to the realm of Perſy / the other way is by the ende that goeth nigh to the cyte yt Alexander founded / that is called Port de ferr. The other way is towarde the ſee of Maior and paſſe by the realm of Dabcas by ye firſt way. Capars mē can nat entre in

Carbādas landes without great danger and payne. For cauſe that they coude nat fynde paſture for theyr horſes tyll many dayes iourneys ende / for this coūtrey is dry and barr. And ſo or thei coud cōe to they good landes theyr horſes ſhulde dye for lacke of meate. And with a ſmall company of ēnemys they that ſhulde paſſe myght leſe theyr lyues by the other way / at ye ende Totays mē myght entre īto Carbādas landꝭ .vi. monethes in ye 
                  yer in ye wynter tyme. but Albaga dyde make a dayes iourney of length lyſſes dykes and thynges ī a place that is called Cyba / & now there be men of warr forto kepe ye paſſages. Totays men haue many tymes proued forto paſſe / priuily but they coude nat. For they muſt paſſe by a playne that is called Mongan. In this playne be euer in wynter a maner of wylde-foule yt they call Seyſerach / theſe byrdes be as great as feſātes and with feyre feders. And whan any men cōe into this playn theſe byrdes fle away and paſſe the Lyces toward the playn of Mongan / & by the token of theſe byrdes commyng. The kepars of the ſayd Lices knowe the cōmyng of theyr ennemys / and than they puruey for them for the kepynge of the ſayde paſſage. By ye other way toward the maior ſee they durſt nat entre for they ſhuld be fayn to entre and paſſe by the realme of Dabcas. Which is garnyſſhed with men & ſtronge landes / & ſo they can nat paſſe. And by this maner Carbā
                  da & his auncetours haue defēded theyr lādes from the great myght of theyr ennemys & neyghbours.
            
            
               ¶The maner and gyſe yt the tartar vſe amonge them.
               yEt ſhall we ſay ſome thȳ
                  ge of the tartas maner & cuſtome. The tartas be moche dyuers of maner and cuſtome. It is nat poſſible to reherſe the dyuerſite of them / the Tartas beleue in god and name god onely & they ſaye that god is immortall. And none other reuerēce thei do to god / nother by praier faſting / aflictions / nor none other good dedꝭ. The tartas thȳke no ſynne to haue kylde a man if ye byt was in the horſe mouth / they thinke to haue ſȳned deedly. The tartas thinke that ye deed of lechery is no ſynne / they haue dyuerſe wyues & by theyr guyſe & cuſtome after the dethe of theyr father / the ſon̄ muſt take for his wyfe his mother in lawe. And the brother the wyfe that was his brothers wyfe and make theyr beddes togyder. The tartas be good mē of armes / to theyr lordes they be obedyent more thā any other nation. Ther lorde gyueth them no wages / but he may take from thē what it pleaſe hym. Nor for coſt or ridynge theyr lorde is nat bounde to gyue them any thing / but they be fayne to lyue on their pray & haūtyng yt thei take vpon their ēnemies. whā
                  
ye tartas ryd & paſſe by a paſſage ther as they thinke to fynd no vitayles they bringe with thē great plenty of beeſtes / kyne / & mares. & lyue of the mylke & of the fleſſhe of theſe beeſtes & ete it & ſay that it is good fleſſhe. The tartas be moch light in dede of armes a horſbake but a fote they be nat moche worth for they can nat go a fote whā thei be ordayned forto fyght they vnderſtande ſhortly theyr captayns wyll and knowe what they haue to do. Wherfore the captayns rule theyr men lightly without any labour / the Tartas be ſubtyll forto take townes and caſtels. The tartas ſeke euer ther aduātage vpō theyr ennemys in batayle & wyll do none other thynge to theyr profet. The tartas haue more vauntage than other men / for if they be in a felde togyder forto fyght agaynſt theyr ennemys if it pleaſe thē thei ſhall fight / & if the batayle pleaſed nat thē / theyr ēnemis can nat fyght agaynſt thē nor come nygh thē. The tartas batayle is moche mortall / for in one lytell batayle of the tartas / ther 
                  ſhuld be more mē ſlayne & wounded than in a great batayle of other men / and that is for the bowes & arowes that they ocupyed, whan the tartas be ouer com they ron̄ all togyther as nigh as it can be poſſible / & is a peryllous thinge to folowe them / for in goyng they kyll with their bowes horſes & mē / & ſhote backward as thei do forward. & if thei ſe yt their ennemys folowed folyſſhely they torne vpon them. And ſomtyme it happened that they that ran after them by kylled & ſlayne. The tartas hoſte is nat of grete muſtre bycauſe that they go nygh one with an other / ſo nygh that .x. houſāde tartas ſhewe nat .v. hunderd. the tartas be of fayre ſpeking to their hooſtes and courteſly they ſpende theyr meate. And lykewiſe yt they ſhulde ben done with them or els they wolde take ſome parforce the tartas can well conquer ye ſtrāge thinges but they can nat kepe it / For they loued better to be in tentes and in the feldes thanne in the townes / the tartas be moche couytouſe and occupied moche to take other mennes goodes and they cā nat kepe theyr owne and nought thei wyll ſpend. whan ye tartas be in cōpany ther as they may be maiſters they be of great corage and proude. And whā they ſe yt thei cā nat haue ye maſtry thei be courtes & honeſt. the tartas wyll euer take thingꝭ to theyr ꝓfet & ſhortly they be vp / and in .ii. thinges they dar nat make a lye / nor ſay yt they had done any good dede of armes yf they had nat done / nor deny theyr euyll dedes if they had done any. The other before the lorde or the Iuge in iugmēt he dare nat deny the trouth though he ſhuld be cō
                  dēpned or leſe his lyfe / & as moche as is ſufficyent yt tartas ſpeketh.
            
            
               ¶The maner howe a kynge or a prince ſhlud order thē to warr.
               
                  REaſon requireth that who ſo euer wyll moue warr agaynſt his ennemys / ought to cō

And frere Hayton that by the cōmaundement of our lorde the apoſtle ought to ſpeke of this matter I may ſay truely that the chriſtēmen haue Iuſt and reſonable cauſe to moue warr agaynſt the ſaraſyns to the valyaunt kynred of Mahomet. For they haue occupyed theyr owne herytage that is the holy lande / the whiche almyghti god promyſed to ye criſtenmen. And ther they fynde the ſepulture of our lorde Iheſu that is the begynnynge of the chriſten fayth. And for ye great diſhoneſty and great loſſe of blode that ye criſtēmen haue had by the ſaraſyns / and euyll lyuers in tyme paſſed & for other dyuers reaſons yt ſhulde be long to reherſe. The ſecond reſon I ſay that no man ought to be in doute for ye holy church of rome which is lady & maiſters of all the world hath wyll power by ye grace of god / and with the helpe of the good kynges and princes of ye criſten fayth. And the ſeruauntes of Chriſt to delyuer the ſepulture & the holy lande from the ſaraſyns power / the which lande they hold and occupy by our ſynnes. Of the thyrde reaſon & the fourth I ſpeke it is to knowe the maner and condicion of his ēnemys and to choſe tyme place and ſeaſon conuenyēt forto begyn warre. I muſt ſpeke more at length / for a good ſurgyen that ought to knowe the ſyckenes of yt which he wyll gyue helth Likewyſe a kyng or a prīce ought te enquer thintent condicyon and ſtate of his ennemys to thintent yt he may begyn his warre wiſely / maynteyn and bringe to a good end. To a prince in dedes of war the ſecrete of his ennemys ought nat to be hydde from him. For the thynges yt be proued before hand can do no grefe / and in the maters vnpurueyed ſomtymes trouble. Many mē coragious is dedes of armes and bataylles / whan they haue no tyme nor rome to beware of the people and dangers that be redy to come in all other maner of warkes. A remedy may be found except in batayle if it be any faute in / for ſoone after the payn foloweth aft the coſt. wherfore to thītent that more euydent vnderſtādyng ſhuld be vpon ourſayeng we ſhal ſpeke of ye paſſage of ye holy land.

                  THe ſowdan that holdeth nowe the realm of Egypt and of Syrie / is named Melcuaſer & is a Cumany by his natyon. The knyghtes and ye hooſt of Egypt be men of dyuers partꝭ and of ſtraūge landes / for ye men of that countrei be nought bowed a fote nor an horſbacke nother by ſee nor land. The ſowdā of Egiptes power of fotemē is nat great but of horſmen is mighty. Verily the mooſt part of thē be Sclauys that haue ben bought & ſolde / the which the euyl criſtēmen brought there forto ſell them for couetiſe of money. And other be they yt were takē in batayle / which be cōſtrayned to forſake the lawe of Chriſt. But the Sclauys that be ſolde be more prayſed and more honoured and dyuerſe tymes it happened yt many wolde be ſold bycauſe that they ſhall be the better beloued of theyr lord and maiſter. The ſowdā of Egypt is euer in great dout and ſuſpection of his men / for thei be of ſuch cōdicyon that they euer take the lordſhyppe of their prȳce And by reaſon of that many ſowdans hath ben ſlayne. The hooſt of Egypt may be about .xx. thouſand knyghtes / and ſome of them be good warryours & vſed to do verily the gretteſt parte is but of ſmall price. whan ye ſowdā goeth with his hooſt he taketh wt hym / a great quantyte of ſtoffe / and of laden horſes for the warre. They haue reſonably of goodes & lyght forto ronne / theyr horſes and mules be but ſmall / nor they cā nat do moch labour and thei haue great nede of good kepyng. The hooſt of Egypt is euer redy and apparylled to the ſowdans cōmaundement / for all they inhabit in ye cyte of Cayre. The condicyon of the hooſt of Egypt is ſuche / euery mā of armes hath his wages whiche paſſeth nat .vi. ſkore floryns / and euery man is bounde to kepe .iii. horſes and a camell forto bere his ſtoffe. And whan ye ſowdan bringeth his men out of the realme of Egypt he gyueth them ſomwhat more if it pleaſe hym. The ſowdā departeth his wages and offices and gyue them in kepynge to his barownes that he called Admiralles / to ſome he gyueth a hunderd to ſome .ii. honderd more & leſſe. After that he wyll do more honor and profet to one than to an other For if the ſowdan gyue power to one admyrall to kepe an hunderd or two honderd knightes / he ſhall gyue hym for all the hole wagꝭ as moche as it ſhall come to in a hole ſom̄e. And by reaſon of this the ſodan hath great faure ī his ſeruice. For this Admyrall that gyue ſeruyce to an hūderd or two hūderd knyghtꝭ / thei be Sclauōs of their owne money & delyuerd harnes / & horſes and put them in ſeruyce for men of warre / and receyued theyr wagis. And ſykemē of ſmall price

and gaue them ſome thinges and delyuerd them horſes and harnes And receyue wages for them & all ye remenāt thei put ī their purſes. Wherfore diuerſe tymes amonge ſur he men / is found but fewe valyant men.

Whan he wyll put ſege to any lande / for if he wyll without any wages but gyueng them ſome He may haue them forto go in batayle or forto defende his lande. The aboue ſayd Bednȳs / & turkmens / wolde do nothyng for ye ſodan without great wages and yf the ſowdan wolde cauſe thē to do byforce they ſhuld go away. The turkmēs ioyned to the moūtayns and the Bednyns ioyned to ye deſertꝭ of Arabe. yet the ſowdā hath a ſergeantre a fote in the coūtreis of Moyllebech / & about the moūt Lyban / & in the lande of the Aſſaſȳs. And myght haue helpe of thē to put the ſege to a cyte or to a caſtell / or forto kepe ye lande in their coūtrey. But out of theyr coūtrey they wolde nat go for the ſowdan nor he can nat conſtrayn them for the great moūtayns ther as they be. The ſowdā of Egypt is moch ſubtyll for to take cytyes & caſtels and ī diuers maners they ſet vpō the landes. Forby troſbowes / ſtones / & mynes vnder the grounde / and by fyre that cā nat be put out. And by other maner yt thei take ye landes lyghtly without any ꝑyll.

And kept the lordſhippe of Egypt thoſe of Mahometz kynred .CCC.xlvii. yeres. After that ye ſaraſyns toke the landꝭ / and the Medyens that be called Cordins ocupied ye lordſhyppe of Egypt as we ſhall ſay here after.

And thought to haue a great treaſour of the Calyfe that was called Saraton / he and a great cōpany of men a war came to helpe the Calyfe / & thoſe men dyd ſo moch that they droue the chriſtēmen out of the lande of Egypt riche and delectable. And the power of the Calyf was ſmale the ſowdan coueyted the lordſhip wherfore he toke hym and put hȳ in pryſon & than after he ſet vpon the lande valyantly and put it in his ſubiection / and made hym ſodan and lorde of Egypt / this Paraton was of the Coraſmyns nacion and was the fyrſt lorde in Egypt of his nation.
               ¶After the dethe of Saratō one of his ſonnes was made lorde of Egipt that was called Salzadin And this Salzadyn dyd ſo moch that he vndyde the kyng of Hieruſalem and toke his cyties byforce and toke dyuers other landes of the chriſtēmens / as it apperith by the boke of the cōqueſtes of the holy lande. After the deth of Salzadyn / his brother and one of his neuiewes one after an other kept the lordſhip of Egypt tyll ye ſowdās tyme that was called Mellecaſa.

into the realme of Syrie / and driued out Gynbago and .x. thouſād tartas / the which Halcon had left for to kepe the lande of Syrie. As he retorned to Egypt an other of the ſayde Cucumans kylde hym. Which was called Bēdocdar and made hym ſowdā and made hym calle Meldaer. This was moche wiſe and valyant to ye armes & to his power he roſe moche / the ſaraſyns power in the realme of Sirie and Egypt. And toke many cyties and landes that the chriſtenmen kept. And toke byforce the noble cyte of Antyoch. In the yere of our lorde god. M.CC.lxviii.

The ſowdā thought to haue kylde hym by an Aſſaſyn by the which Aſſaſyn ye kyng was hurt / with a knyfe that was poyſoned / but he was hole agayne by the grace of god. Thā after it happened yt the ſowdan had a drinke with mortall venym / and dyed in the cyte of Damas. After his deth his ſonne that was called Melecſart was mad ſowdā / but he kept nat long the lordſhippe of Egypt for an other Cucumant that was called Elſy dryue hym oute of the lordſhip and the lande of Egypt & made him ſodan. This Elſy was he that layd ſege before the cyte of Triple / and toke it byforce. In ye yere of our lorde god a thouſand two hondred foureſkore & nyne.

Vpon a day as he put hym in a pleaſaunte place for to eaſe hym ſelfe / yt fortuned that a ſeruaunt the whiche he truſted well / and had made hym conſtable of his hooſt / gaue hym poyſon to drynke and dyed ſoone after. This cōſtable occupyed the lordſhyp / but the other ran vpon hym and cutte hym all in pecys. After that one of Elſy ſōnes was made ſowdan yt was named Melecaſſeraph / the which toke the cytie of Acre / and put out of the landes of Syrie all the chriſtenmen. This was in the yere of our lorde god a thouſande. CC.lxxxxi.

And after that he that is ſowdan nowe was made ſowdan in Egypt that is called Melcuaſer which was Melecaſſeraph brother. And bycauſe that this Melecuaſer was yonge he was put vnder an ouerſear which was of the tartas nacion and was called Ginboga / this Gynboga putte away this chyld
                  
Melecuaſe and put hym inward into the crake of moūt royall and toke the lordſhip & made hymſelfe ſowdan / and was called Melecadell. In this Melechadels dayes was ſo grete nede of vitayles that all the ſaraſyns dyed for hunger if it had nat ben for the falſe chriſtenmen that brought them vitayle Inough for couytes of money. Aft that it happened ye tidynges came of the tartas cōmynge / thā Ginboga gathered his hoſte & went into the realme of Syrie forto defend the lande agaynſt ye tartas. This Ginboga honoured moch thoſe yt had bē tartas & kept thē nere hym of this ye Cucumās had great enuy. Wherfore it happed yt as Ginboga retorned to Egypt the Cucumans put hym out of his lordeſhip / and made one of thā ſowdan that was called Lachyn & was called after Melecuaſer. This Lachyn wold nat kyll Gynboga bycauſe that he wolde be his felowe / but gaue him a coūtrey yt was called Sarta. and after that he gaue hym the lordſhyp of Haman / but he wolde nat ſuffre that Ginboga ſhuld dwell in Egypt. This ſowdan taryed .iii. yeres in the caſtell of Cayre for fere of his men except a day yt he came downe to ye playn and came there to play at the foreball / his horſe fyll vnder hym and brake his legge. After it happed that vpon a day this ſowdan Lachyn played at cheker & had putte his ſwerde nygh hym & one of his owne ſeruauntes toke the ſwerde and ſtrake hym & ſone after the other ran vpon hym yt had done ye dede / & cut hym all in pecis and after that the ſaraſyns wer in great debate for to make a ſowdan but ī 
                  thend they agreyd and put Melecuaſer aforeſayd in the lordſhip the which Ginboga had laſt in the crake of mount royall. This ſowdan is he that ouercame Caſan in the felde & is yet ſowdan of Egipt It ſhalbe forgyuen me yf I ſpeke to lange of the Cucumans that be ſubgettes bought & ſolde / & of the ſowdans of theyr kinred for I do to ſhewe yt the ſaraſins can nat be long without ſuch a fortune ſhuld come vnto thē / by the whiche they might nat cōe out of Egipt nor go with an hooſt in an other lande.
            
            
               ¶How the lande of Egypt is watred with the water of flud Gyon.
               THe realm of Egipt is moche riche & delyctable. It is .xv. dayes iourney of length & thre dayes iourney in brede. The land of Egipt is a yle / for by both the ſydes is deſertes & ſand is and of the other part is the ſee of grece toward thorient is more nygh of the lande of Syrie than of any other lande. Verily betwene ye .ii. realmes is well .viii. dayes iourney of way / & all landes towarde thoccydent finyſſhed to one of the Barbare prouynce / that is called Darta / & betwene theſe two landꝭ is well .xv. dayes iourney of deſertes / toward mydday fyniſſhed wt
                  
the realme of Nabye which be criſtēmen and all blacke for the hete of the ſonne. And bytwene ye two landes is well .xii. dayes iourney and all ſandes. In the realm of Egypt be .v. prouinces. The firſt is called Sayth / the ſeconde Meſer the thyrde Alexander / the .iiii. Rychy. This coūtrey is cloſed of the ſee and fluddes of an yle / and the other Damyette. The chefe cytie of the realme of Egypt is called Cayre / and is nygh of an olde cytie that is called Meſer. Theſe two cyties be vpon ye fuld of Nyll ſyde / which rōneth by the lande of Egypt that is called Gion. This fludde is moch ꝓfitable for it watreth all the landes ther as it paſſeth and maketh all the lādes fruit full / and habondaunte of all maner of goodꝭ. In the flud of Nyll be fyſſhes ynough and bere great ſhippes for it is great & depe. and aboue all the fluddes ye Nyll may be praſed yf it were nat that there is a maner of beeſtes that be called dragons / & deuoured horſes & men that be vpon the water & vpō the ſee whan thei may haue them. Theſe beeſtes be called Cocalx / ye 
                  fludd of Nyll riſeth ones in a yer and begynneth to ryſe at myddes of Auguſt & ſo riſynge tyll ſaynt Michaels day. And whan it is ſo high that it can no more the mē of the countrey let the water ron by bykes & ſmale ryuers ſo that they water all the countrey. And ſo the water tarieth there .xl. dayes and whan the gound is dry the peple ſowe & ſet all the ground. And bycauſe of the ſayd watryng all maner of goodes growe in ye lande / for in theſe partes is neuer rayne nor ſnowe / nor ye ran nat knowe the winter from the ſomer, yet the habytauntes of Egypt hath put a colombe of Marble in the myddꝭ of ye flude of Nyll in a lytell yle yt is called meſer & haue made tokēs in the ſayd colombe. And whā the fludde is flowen as moche as it may they loke vpō the colombe tokens & after the riſyng of the water they ſhall knowe yf they ſhall haue great plenty of goodes that yere / or toſkant. And vpon yt thei ſet price vpon theyr marchaūdyſe The water of the fludde of Nyll is holſome to drinke / but whan it is taken out of the fludde it is to hote. But they put it in a veſſell of yerth / & than it is clere colde & holſome. In the realme of Egypt be two ſee portes / or hauens. the one is called Alexander / and the other Damyette. In Alexanders porte may well come in ſhippes & galyes / & the cyte is ſtrong & well walled. The waters that they drinke in Alexandre cometh in cundittes from the flude of Nyll of yt which they fylled their ceſterns / that thei haue ynough in the cyte. They haue none other water yt thei might drynke. Wherefore yf ye water that ronned in the cundytes myght be ſtopped they ſhuld be in great payne / & long they coude nat lyue by any other wiſe it ſhuld be hard to take Alexander biforce. The cytie

of Damyette is vpon the flude of Nyll which was well cloſed in the olde tyme / but it was taken twyſe by the chriſtēmē. Ones by ye kyng of Hieruſalem / & by the other cryſtēmen of thorient. And the other tyme by the kyng of Fraunce ſaȳt Loys and bycauſe of that the ſaraſins brake it downe / and tranſported ferre from the ſee & they made no walles nor ſtronge place & called this newe lande / newe Damy ette. And the old Damyette is all waſted with the portes of Alexandre and Damyette. The ſowdan hath great goodes / the lande of Egypt yelde great haboundance of ſocour & of almaner of goodꝭ they haue nat moch wines / but ye wyne that groweth there is very good / the ſaraſyns dare nat drinke wyn becauſe that it is for bydden them by theyr lawe / moten / hēnes / and gottes thei haue ynough / but thei haue nat moch befe. And ere hors fleſſhe / in the realme of Egypt be ſome chriſtēmen dwellynge ther / that be called kepty & hold the maner of the Iacobyns. And in that parties they haue dyuers abbeys & holde them fre and in peace / and theſe Keptys were the oldeſt heyres of the lande of Egypt for ye ſaraſyns began to inheryt the land ſythe that they had the lordſhip ye thynges that they can nat fynd in Egypt & that the Egipciēs coude nat fynd if they ſhuld nat haue of other men they ſhuld haue great nede / as yron & other thinges bycauſe & faute of that thei coud nat lyue longe in all the realme of Egypt is no cytie nor caſtell walled but the cyte of Alexandre yt which is well walled. The ſowdan dwelled in the caſtell of Cayre / whiche was nat ſtronge all ye lande of Egypt is kept & defended by knightes. Than ſyth the hooſt of Egipt was ouercome the land might be ſhortly cōq̄red & wtout any dāger.

Wherfore it is lyke that god almyghtie wyll delyuer the holy lande & yet all chriſtenmen of dyuers landes and of dyuers realmes by fayth and deuocyon be apparelled to toke the croſſe / and to paſſe ouer the ſee into the holy land.

Alſo by the tartaras warre by the whiche they were ouercome and loſte mē without nombre in batayle. Alſo for this ſowdā that raigned thoſe dayes in Egypt / that was a man of no goodneſſe & nothyng worth Moreouer all the ſaraſyns prynces be deed that were wōt to gyue helpe to the ſowdan by the power of the tartas. And one was lefte alone that was named ſowdan de Meredyn / the which is tourned lately to the tartas ſubiectiō. And therfore at this tyme without any daunger or payne / the holy lande myght be recouered / and ye realm of Egipt and of Syrie cōquered. And alſo with all the power of the ennemys might be the more eaſly brought downe nowe / than in tymes paſſed.

And ſo it were nede that the chriſtēmen ſhuld ſet vpon the holy lande without any taryenge / for in the taryenge is great daunger. For fere of Carbanda that is nowe frende ſhulde fayle / and an other might cōe that ſhulde vſe the mahometz wayes & that ſhulde agre with ye ſaraſyns And ſo it myght tourne to great dāmage and paryll of the chriſten lande / and of the holy lande ouer the ſee.

                  ſume and waſt all his treſoure ſo moche that it was hard to beleue the great ſome of good that the ſodan and his men ſpende and conſumed euery tyme that they came out of Egypt landes / forto come ī Syrie. yet by the ſayd galeys the wayes and the portes of the ſayde ſee myght be kept in ſuche maner that it ſhuld be brought nothinge to thēnemys of ſuch thyngꝭ yt they haue more nede / & that they coude nat endure long without as yron ſtele and other thinges that be brought vnto theym out of ſtraunge coūtres. yet more thēnemys ſhuld loſe the rentes of ye ſee portes that is a great ſome of good & treſure.
            
            
               
               yEt yf it ſhulde happen yt the ennemys were troubled by ſome aduerſite & that they coude nat departe out of Egipt nor gyue helpe to the landꝭ of Syrie. Than the pylgryms of this fyrſt paſſage with helpe of other chriſtēmen of thoryent partꝭ myght well redreſſe ye cyte of Triple / & to the moūt Lyban be criſtē
                  men dwellynge / good ſergeantes about .xl. thouſand yt 
                  ſhuld gyue the pylgrymes great helpe. And many tymes they haue ryſen agaynſt the ſowdan & do hym & to his mē gret harm & dāmage. And thā if the cytie of Triple ſhuld be formed / the chriſtēmen myght holde it tyll the cōmynge of the paſſage generall & myght take all the coū
                  trey about / and kepe the coūtrey of Triple. And might retorne eaſly by the men that ſhulde come to the generall paſſage for thei ſhuld fynde ye port redy ther they might ſurely come. yet yf it ſhuld hapen that the tartas ſhulde occupie the realme & the holy lande. The chriſtēmen of the fyrſt paſſage ſhulde be redy to receyue the tartas landes & to kepe them in ſuch maner And I that knowe reſonably the tartas wyll I beleue that all ye landes that they ſhuld conquere vpō the ſaraſins that with a gode wyl they ſhuld gyue them in kepynge to the chriſtēmen franke & quyte. For the tartas coude nat dwell in that countrey for the great here yt is there in ſomer / wherfore they ſhuld be glad that the chriſtenmen ſhuld holde the landes & kepe thē The tartas do neuer fyght withe the ſowdā of Egypt for couytous to gette landes & cyties. For they haue all Aſie ī theyr ſubiectiō / but thei fight for cauſe that the ſowdā hath euer ben theyr princypall ennemy. And hath done them more harme & dāmage than any other / and ſpecially whan thei haue had warr agaynſt theyr neyghbours. And for this reaſōs aboue ſayd I truſt that the nombre aboue is ſufficyēt. It is to knowe a thouſand knyghtes .x. galleys / and .iii.M. ſergeantes & many thinke that in this begynnynge that they ſhulde nat make ſo many men that this ſhuld do / and the exſpences & coſt ſhulde multiply moche.
            
            
               yEt by this fyrſt paſſage might cōe .iii. other profettes. For ſyth yt the pylgryms of the firſt paſſage hath taryed in the partes be end the ſee a ſeaſon / and had knowen the cōdicyon & maner of the lande & of the ennemys. They might gyue warnynge to the other pylgrims that ſhuld come to ye generall paſſage. yet take we ye tartas for warre or for other thyngꝭ / or for excuſe that they wolde nat gyue helpe to the chriſtēmen agaynſt the ſaraſyns / And yt the ſowdan & his men wer in ther proſperite / & that it ſhuld nat be an eaſy thinge to conquere the holy lande. And to delyuer it out of the ennemyes power. your holy paternite knowyng the condicyon

of the holy lande. And ſeynge the generall paſſage myght haue better counſel & aduertiſmēt vpon ſuch thynges that ſhuld be cōuenyent forto do or forto paſſe / ouer the generall paſſage or to tary for conuenyent tyme. And by ye reaſon of this all the daungers of the ennemyes may be auoyded.
            
            
               yEt your holyneſſe ſhall ꝑdon me I dare ſay two other wordꝭ. The one is that your holynes wold wryte to the kyng of the Georgiens that be chriſtēmen / & that they be more deuout peple thā any other nacyō to ye pylgrimagꝭ / & to the holy relykꝭ of ye holy lande yt they ſhuld gyue helpe & ſocour to the pylgrims to recouer ye holy lande. I beleue verily for the honour of god and for the reuerēce of your holynes they fulfill your cōmaūdement for thei be deuout chriſtēmen and men of great power / & valyant men of armes & neighbours of the realm of Armeny. And yet that your holy paternyte wold write to the king of Nubiens / which be chriſtēmen and wer conuerted to the fayth of Chriſt / by ſaynt Thomas in ye holy lande of Etyope. Sendynge yt they ſhuld moue warr agaynſt ye ſowdan & his men. And I beleue verily that the aboue ſayd Nubyens for the honoure of our lorde & for the reuerence of your holynes they ſhuld moue warr agaynſt ye ſowdan & his men / & ſhulde do thē harm & dāmage to theyr power / & that ſhuld be great trouble for the ſowdan & for his men. And the ſayde letters myght be ſende to the kyng of Armeny that ſhuld tranſlate them in theyr langage & ſende them by your meſſangers.

               ¶Of the generall paſſage.
               THe generall paſſage may be in .iii. wayes The one ſhuld be by the way of Barbary But this way I wolde nat gyue coūſell to them that knowe the cō
                  dicion of the countrey. The other ſhuld be by they way of Conſtantynople / it is to knowe by the way that Godfray de bullyen & other pylgrims / in that tyme kept as I beleue parfetly the paſſage generall myght go lightly to the cytie of Conſtantynople. But goynge ouer the braz of Georgie & goyng by the turkes / the way ſhulde nat be ſure. For the turk mēs yt be ſaraſyns and ye dwell in turky / truely the tartas may delyuer & enſur the way / & might ordayne that in the lande of turkey ſhulde be brought vitayles ynough into ye pylgrims

hooſt & horſes of a reſonable price. The other way that euery body knoweth it is by the ſee / therfore if ye paſſage wyll go by ye ſee ther muſt be at euery port of ye ſee ſhippes redy apꝑelled & other neceſſary thyngꝭ to paſſe with the pylgrims. And moreouer it ſhuld be cōuenyent to a prefeke terme & a couenable ſeaſon that all ye pylgrimes ſhuld be redy to go in the ſhippes & paſſe togyder / & ſo they might come to Cipres & reſt them and their horſes of the ſee labour. After yt the paſſage gen̄all ſhulde be aryued in Cipres & ſhuld be refreſſhed a certayn dayes / yf ye pylgrims of the firſt paſſage had cloſed the citie of Triple / or an other vpon the ſee in Syrie. The paſſage myght come thyder and that ſhulde be to them great eaſe. And yf the pylgrims of ye firſt paſſage had nat cloſed ſome lande ī Syre It ſhuld be nede that the paſſage generall ſhuld take the way by ye realm of Armeny. In this maner it is to knowe that the pylgrimes ſhuld refreſhe them & their horſes in the realme of Cipres / tyll Myhelmas day that they might paſſe ſurely to the realme of Armeny / & ther they ſhuld fynde ſuch thingꝭ as they ſhuld nede to. Verily thei myght tary in the cytie of Terſot more eaſely bycauſe yt they ſhulde fynde ther great plente of waters and paſtour for their horſes. And from the realme of turkey that is nygh they ſhuld bringe vitayle & horſes & ſuch thinges yt they ſhuld haue nede of in the lande of Armeny. Alſo & they myght tary all the wynter in Armeny & whan the paſtur 
                  ſhuld be cōming the pylgrīs hoſte might go to Antioch that is from ye lande of Armeny a dayes iourney. And frō thens the ſhippꝭ mygth go by the ſee to the port of Antioch / and ſo the ſee hooſt & the lande hooſt ſhuld be neyghbours After that the pylgrims ſhuld haue occupied the cytie of Antioche the which they ſhuld ſhortly take with ye helpe of god. The pylgrimes myght refreſſhe them in this lande certayn dayes & myght ron̄ and rauyſſhe their ennemys landes that be ther aboue. And there with they might knowe the condicyon ſtate & wyll of their ennemis that be ther about. And in this ꝑties of Antioch there be chriſtēmē dwellyng that be good ſergeantꝭ and ſhuld come with a good wyll to the chriſtēmens hooſt / & myght do them good ſeruyce. After that the pylgrims ſhuld depart out of Antioch they myght go by the ſee ſyde to the cite of Lyche. this way ſhuld be ſhorter & better for the ſee doth flowe to the hooſt of ye 
                  land. Verily nygh to the Margat by ye ſee fyd is a paſſage that troubleth moche the people yt paſſe by. And yf it ſhuld happen yt the ennemys had garnyſſhed this paſſage ī ſuche maner yt the pylgrems might nat paſſe. Our men might retorn without any daunger into Antyoche / & myght go by ye way of Ephemye toward Ceſar by the ſyd
                  
of the flud of Reuell vpward & by that way ye hoſte ſhuld 
                  find gode paſture & good waters & the ennemies landes garniſſhed with vytayle & other goodes of the which the hooſt myght haue great eaſe / And by this way our men myght go by the cyte of Haman which is a riche cytie / the which the criſten men might occupy ſhortly. And if it ſhuld happē yt the enemis wold 
                  defend Haman for bycauſe it is a riche cyte & that thei ſhuld nat cōe to the batayle agaynſt the chriſtē
                  men they ſhuld haue a great vaū
                  tage to fight in that place & ſhuld lighty ouercome their ennemies / and yf the chriſtēmen might ones ouercome the ſowdans hooſt. After that they ſhuld fynde nothyng agaynſt them / and ſo they myght go ſtreight to the cytie of Damas the which they ſhuld take or they ſhuld yelde thēſelfe by ſome treatie. For ſyth the ſowdan ſhulde be ouercome / they of Damas ſhulde nat hold but they wolde yelde thē with a good wyll. They lyue ſafe as they dyd to Halcon & to Caſan after that they had ouercome yt ſo dan. And thā yf the criſtēmen had taken Damas they ſhuld lightly conquere the remynaunt. And yf the ennemies ſhuld loſe ye batayle the criſtēmen might come to Tryple in .iiii. dayes frō Damas and might make agayne ye cite of Triple. and wt this the criſtēmen that be of the moūt Lyban ſhuld gyue great helpe to the pylgrimes / & ſo yf the chriſtēmen myght kepe the cite of Triple they might cōquer ye cite of Ieruſalē wt helpe of god.
               OF the cōpany of the chriſtenmen & of the tartas I thȳke that a certayne nombre about .xx. thouſand tartas myght do great eaſe & proffet to the chriſtēmen goynge by the coūtres for fere of the tartas / the Bednyns / nor tuckemens durſt nat come nygh to the chriſtēmens hooſt / the other eaſe ſhuld be that the tartas ſhuld puruay for vitayle to the chriſtēmens hooſt / & ſhuld cōe out of ferre coū
                  treis forto gette money or ſome other thinge. yet by the tartas they might enquere & knowe the communycation of the ennemyes for the tartas be lyght for to ron̄ in & out. and can well entre & come out night & day of their frewyll to batayle & to bete cyties. The tartas myght be thrifty for they be moch ſubtyll in ſuche thinges. And yf it ſhulde happen that Carbanda or an other in his rome wt men ſhuld come for to entre in the lande of Egipt / than it ſhuld be well done to ſhyft & go ferre from their cōpany For the tartas wolde nat do after the chriſtēmens wyll / & the chriſtē
                  men myght nat folowe the tartas wyll that be a horſbacke & go haſtly. And the chriſtēmen myght nat folowe them for the fotemen.
               YEt whan ye tartas know that they be ſtronge & haue power they be moche proude and without reaſon. And

coude nat be wtout doynge harme to the chriſtēmen / the which thing the chriſtenmen might nat ſuffre. Wherof myght come great ſklaū
                  dre and euyll wyll amonge them / but vpō this thei might put good remedy. It is to knowe yt the tartas ſhulde go by Damas way as they be vſed to do euer. And ye criſtēmen ſhuld go in the parties of Iheruſalem / & in this maner goyng ferre one frō an other it ſhuld be good peace betwene the tartas and the chriſtēmen & loue kept / & the myght of the ennemies ſhulde be confounded rather by two than by one. yet an other thinge I wyll remembre to your holyneſſe it is this the chriſtēmens coūſell ſhuld be kept wyſely for in tyme paſſed they wold nat kepe their counſell Wherfore they haue hadde many great ſorowes & the ennemys haue ſkaped many great daūgers / & haue taken from the chriſtēmen ye maner to accōplyſſh their deſyres And yf it be ſo that the paſſage gefiall name might nat be kept cloſe for thei ſhuld go by the vniuerſall world. Neuertheleſſe that coude nat torne to no daūger nor loſſe to ennemies for they coude nat haue no helpe of no port / and in dyuers maners the chriſtēmens counſell myght be kept doynge maner to do a thinge and do an other / and the cauſe that the tartas coud nat kepe their counſell. Which thinge hath done them often tymes grete harme / the tartas hath ſuch a maner that at firſt mone of Ianuarii they take counſell of all ſuch thynges that they haue to do in ye yere Wherfore yf it fortune yt they wyll moue warr agaynſt the ſowdā of Egypt ſoone after their coūſell is knowē of all & ſo ye ſaraſyns ſende worde to the ſowdan / & vpon that the ſowdan maketh hym redy agaynſt thē. the ſacaſyns can kepe well their coūſel which thȳg hath done thē many tymes good. And ſo it is ſufficiently ſpoken & ſayde for this preſent tyme vpon ye dede of the paſſage generall of the holy lande by ende the ſee.
               AFter all this I pray hūbly that bleſſyd holynes wyll receyue this yt my deuocyon writeth vpon the paſſage of the holy land. And yf I haue ſayd more or laſſe yt it ſhuld be I put it to your correctyon. For I had nat ben ſo hardy to giue coūſell vpō ſo great a mater as the paſſage of the holilande yf it were nat by the cōmaū
