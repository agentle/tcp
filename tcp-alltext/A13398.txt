To thy mercye shall I cleue (lorde) which art my strēgth / The lorde is my rocke of stone / my bulwarke / my delyuerer / my god / my defender / vnto whose faithfulnes I betake my selfe / my childe / my sauynge power / my refuge. I magnifyed and worshypped ye lord / & so was I saued fro my enemies Dedly anguysshe inuaded me / and the soden rysynges lyke a rosynge flode of these men of perdicyon assailed me. The strayght helly ieopardes closed me ī / the

snares of deth hampred me. But while I was in this strait I called vpon ye lord I cryed vnto my god / and he harde my voyce in his kingꝭ hall / my cryeng came vp to his eares. For ye erth was moued and trēbled / the fete of ye hylles staggard and were smytten all to pouder / for he was angry. Smoke ascēded / as ye wold saye / into his nostrels / & fyer deuouringe all thinges flewe out of his mouth / & he spouted forth burnynge coles. He lefte the heuens & came downe / a derke cloude was vnder hys fete. He rydeth vpon a swyfte foule & flieth / borne with the winges of the wynde. He made hī a preuye closet / powring darkenesse rounde about his tabernacle / congelīge ther vnto blacke waters into thycke cloudes. But at his shyninge presence / these derke cloudꝭ vanished awaye agayne / with haile stones / and fyry thunder boltes. The lorde thundred in the heuens the most hyghest sente forthe his voyce / with hayle stones and fyry thūdreboltes. He cast forth his arowes & threwe thē doune / he sent forth moche lyghtnynge / & cast them into gret feare Whyles thou thretenest & blamest (oh lorde) blowing forth thy wynde / the holowe bankes of the floudes ar sene vnder drye / & the foundations of the worlde

stande naked. He put downe hys hande from aboue and toke me vp / he drewe me out of moche waters. He delyuered me from mighty enemies / and frō my haters for they preuayled agaynst me. He preuented me beynge in ieoperdye with hys helpe / the lorde was my socour. He led me forth and set me at large / he defended me bycause he fauoured me. The lorde gaue me after my ryght dealynge / and rewarded me accordynge vnto the purenes of my handꝭ. I obserued verily ye wayes of the lord & fell nat vngodlely fro my god. For I had all his decrees before myn eyes / & I dyd nat thruste awaye his lawe fro me. I behaued my self purely & ꝑfitly toward him / & toke gret hede lest I shuld cōmit any yuell thīge. And ye lord hath rewarded my right dealynge / & the purenes of my handꝭ which he aproueth For yu art holy to the holy man / & offrest thy selfe pure to the pure man. With ye pure innocēt yu dealest pure innocently / & with the shrewde mā thou playest ye ouer whart. Thou hast veryly saued thy pore oppressed people / & hast cast down men yt loke alofte. Thou (lorde) hast lightened my cādel / my god hath put away my derkenes wt his lyght. Thorow the haue I broken the hole raye of the batayle / thorow

my god I ouerlept the walles. God is he whose dedes are pure and parfyte / the wordes of the lorde are purifyed / and tried lyke as with fyer / he is a buckler to all that truste in him. For who is god but the lorde? who is a defender / but our god? Euen the same god whiche hathe decked & endued me with a lordely power & hath furthered my waye spedely. He hath made my fete as light as the fete of gotes / and hath made me to ouerronne placꝭ were they neuer so hygh. He hath exercysed and accustomed my handes wt batayle / & hath made me to breke bowes of stele with my armes. Thou hast defended me with thy sauynge shylde & bukler / and thy right hande stayed me / thy fauorable gētylnes made me to haue the ouerhāde of my enemyes. Thou dydest hedge in my waye that I myght go frelye therin / so that my heles shulde nat slyde. I folowed vpō my enemies & toke thē / & neuer turned vntyll I had slayne them. I slewe them / for they might nat stande in my handes / they were throwē downe vnder my fete. Thou hast taught me to fyghte / ye / and that with a puyssaunte power / and as manye as rose agaynste me / thou haste thruste them vnder me. Thou broughtest it so to passe / 

that myne enemyes were fayne to turne their backes / and I made them awaye that hated me. They cryed / but there was no man to kepe them / they cryed to the lorde / but he answered them nat. I knocked theym togyther as small as dust layed redy for ye wynde / I trode thē as small as dyrte of the streates. Thou hast delyuered me from this chydynge / & contentyouse people / and haste made me ruler ouer the gentyles / the folke of whō I had lytell knowlege serued me. As sone as they herde of me / they came to gyther & dyd homage vnto me / the lyenge alyauntes were made subiectes & seruauntes vnto me. These aliaūtes were made drye for feare / and trembled whyles they were shyt vp in strōge holdes. And yet lyueth the lorde / my defendour moughte be praysed / and god my sauyour mought be exalted. Euen god which hath gyuen me power to auenge me of my enemyes / and hathe subdued the people to me. Which hath delyuered me from myne enemyes / he hath set me ouer them which rose agaynst me / and hath delyuered me from the vyolent man. Wherfore I shall magnifye the (oh lorde) with hye praise amōge the nations / and shall synge with thankes geuynge vnto thy name.

Whiche hathe made great helth for hys kynge / he hath delte gentely with his anoynted Dauid / and also withe his seede into euerlastynge.

One daye succedynge another / whetteth contynually our thoughtes / & one night folowyng another / encreaseth our knowlege These creatures haue nether spech nor wordes / neyther is their voyces any where herde. And yet their poyntinge & shewynge hathe taught all the worlde / & their dōme speche hath gone forth īto all the costꝭ of ye worlde. He hath fastened in thē a tabernacle for ye sōne / this sōne cometh forth of his cloudꝭ like a bridegrōe ye lyke a fresshe valyant knyght to make his course. From the farthest eest parte of the heuyns cometh he forthe / hauynge his recourse vnto the other extreme / neither is there any man that maye hyde hī
                  
from his heat. The lawe of the lorde is perfyte / refresshynge the soule / the testymonye of the lorde is faithful / ministrīg wysdome to the vnleeued. The cōmaundemētes of the lorde are right / makynge glad the herte. The thinges whiche god cōmaundeth are playne & pure / & lyghtē the eyes. The feare of the lorde is pure and holy abidynge for euer / the plesures of the lorde ar true & right in euery parte. More worthy to be desyred than golde & precyouse stones / sweter than the honye combe whan it dropeth. And thy seruāt is taught & monisshed by thē / that same obseruynge of them is a great rewarde. Who maye perceyue and consyder what thynge is synne? purge me from secrete euyls. Also turne thou these great synnes from thy seruant / leste they haue domination ouer me / & than shall I be pure and clere from euery great synne. Let ye speches of my mouth & the thoughtes of my herte be plesaunte & accepte vnto the lorde my defender and my redemer.

And at laste he syngeth one god to haue made & to gyue all thinges / and to be euer mercyfull presente with his beloued.
               
               EXultate iusti. Be glad ye rightwise for the lordes sake / for praise becometh iust men. Magnifye ye the lord in prayse with harpe and lute / synge ye vnto him with ten stringed instrumentes. Synge ye vnto him a newe ditie / tune it swetely wt ioyfull melody. What soeuer the lorde hath institute / it is ryght / all his dedes procede of faythfulnes. He loueth to do all thinges ryghtwysly and in due ordre / therth swymmeth in the mercy of the lorde. By the cōmaundement of the lorde / heuens were made / and all their ornourment at his byddynge. He gathered togyther & included the waters of the see / as ye wold say / into a bottell / & layde vp their depnesses lyke treasure. Let all regyons therfore feare the

lorde / let all ye inhabyt the rounde worlde drede him. For it is he / which so sone as he had spoke the worde / all thīges were presente / euery thynge standeth perfyte / euen as he cōmaunded. The lorde scatereth the counseyls of the heythen / & maketh vayne the thoughtes of the people. But the counsell of the lorde stādeth for euer / the thoughtes of hys herte endure thorowe all worldes. Happy is that natyon which hath the lorde for their god / euen the people whom he chuseth to him self in ye place of his possessed herytage. From heuens the lorde loketh downe / & beholdeth narrowly all men. From his sure seate / beholdeth he all the inhabytours of ye erth. He made also the hertꝭ of all men / he vnderstandeth what soeuer they haue done. A kinge is nat saued bicause he hathe a great hoste / neither the valyaunte capitayne escapeth perylles thorowe his owne puissaunte power. That horse shall deceyue the / by whome thou lokest to be saued / he shall nat delyuer y• be he neuer so strōge. But behold it is the lordes eye that is vpon thē whiche feare him / & depende vpon his mercy. That he might delyuer their soules frō deth / & nourysshe thē in tyme of hunger. Our soules might truste in the lorde / he

Busely sought I the lorde / & he answered me / he delyuerd me from all thinges that I feared. Men shall loke vnto hī / & shall make hast / & their faces shall nat be shamed.

Euen the angels pytch tentꝭ roūd about them that fear the lorde / & delyuer them. Taste / & beholde howe good is the lorde / happy is that man that trusteth in him. Worshyppe ye the lorde whiche are his sayntes / for his worshyppers shall neuer want. Stronge lyons shall fainte & famisshe for hunger / whan no good thyng shal fayle ye dilygent sekers of the lorde. Haue done children & here me / for I shal instructe you vnto goddes worshippe. Who soeuer thou art which desirest to lyue / & louest longe lyfe: to delyte in goodnesse. Kepe thy tonge from euyl report and thy mouth from disceytfull speche. Se thou do no man wronge / but bende thy selfe to goodnes / seke studyously and folowe vpō peace. The eyes of the lorde are fastened vpon the rigktwyse / hys eares lysten vnto their cryenge.
               But the grīme coūtinance of the lorde is sette vpon these that do wronge / euen to cutte out their memoriall from therth. But those men crye & the lorde hereth / & he delyuereth them out of euery strainte. Full nyghe is the lorde men broken in herte / he saueth the contryte in spiryte.

Although full many yuels fal vpon the rightwyse / yet the lorde delyuereth them from thē all. He kepeth all their bones so that nat one of them be broken. But euery trouble shall make an ende of the vngodly / & the haters of the rightwyse shalbe shaken awaye. The lorde shall loose & redeme the lyfe of his seruantes / neither shall they be distroied whosoeuer cōmitte their selues to his faithful cure.

But my soule mighte ioye in the lorde / & be glad of his helpe.

Suffre / be styll / and let the lorde worke / abyde his pleasure / be nat angry with hī that prosper in his way / which is the man that is gyuen to deceyte. Refrayne thy selfe from wrath let thy angre be blowen ouer / be nat moued to reuenge. For who so euer ar harmefull and cursed shalbe cut awaye / but they that abyde the lordes pleasure shall inherite the lande. It shal nat be longe but the vngodly shalbe clene gone / thou shalt consyder his place / but he shall no where apere. Meke sprited with paciēt suffrers shall inherite the lande / and they

But the lorde shall laugh him to scorne bicause he seith his daye of iugemēt at ye hande. The vngodly shall drawe out their swerdes / they shall bende their bowes to smyte downe the poore carefull afflycte / and to sley the right treders in the way. But their swerdes shall smyte thorowe their owne hertes / and their bowes shalbe broken. That lytell is better whiche the rightwyse mā hath / than the many folde riches of the gloriouse vngodly. For the strength of the vngodly shall be brokē: but the lorde susteyneth the rightwise. The lorde approueth the dayes of the parfyte faithfull / and their herytage shalbe parpetuall. In tyme of aduersyte they shall nat be shamed / in tyme of hunger they shall be well satisfyed.
               Whan the vngodly shall perissh / and the enemys of ye lorde beyng in fatte pasture at their highest / than shall they vanisshe awaye lyke smoke.

shall inheryt the lande / and they that do euyl shalbe cutte away. For of the lorde the steppes of this man are dyrected / & he fauoreth all thengꝭ that he take in hāde. Whan he shall fall he shall nat be hurte / for the lorde putteth vnder his hande. Uerily I haue ben yonge and olde / and yet sawe I neuer the ryghtwyse forsaken / or his seede beggynge their breed. But dayly he doth mercy & lendeth / and his seede is in a blessed encrease. Eschewe euyll & do good / & thou shalte abyde for euer. For ye lorde loueth that yt is done rightly & in good order / neither forsaketh her his saintes / but they shalbe layd vp for euer / whan the seed of the vngodly shalbe cut of. The rightwyse shall inheryt the lande / & shall dwell vpō it for euer. Wysedōe shall euer be in ye mouth of the rightwyse / and his tonge shall be occupyed ī that which god iugeth good. The lawe of his god is in his herte / the steppes of his fete they shall nat slyde. The vngodly beholdeth the rightwyse / and seketh occasyon to sleye hym. But the Lorde wyll natte leaue hym to his hande / neyther shall he repute hym vngodlye / all thoughe he be so iudged of the wicked. Abyde the lorde and obserue hys waye / and he shall exalte the

I se this sturdy & fearfull vngodly rotyng & dilatynge himselfe / lyke a tree neuer remoued from his naturall fyrst soyle / freshly spredyng his branches. And anon he vanisshed away / & lo / he nowhere apered / I sought him but he was nat founde.

               He shall come down lyke small rayne in to a newe mowen medowe / & lyke rayne which sokingly maketh moist the erth. Rightwismen shall florisshe whyles he raigneth / & there shalbe moche peace endurynge as longe as the moone.
               He shall haue dominyon from the one se to the tother / and from the east floude vnto the worldes ende. Before him shall

fall downe the dwellers of the deserte / & his enemys shall lye ꝓstrate lyckinge the dust. The kynges of Tharsis & of the yeldes shall gyue him gyftes / the kinges of Sheba & Sebashall offre vnto him honourably. All kynges shall do homage vnto him: all nacyons shall serue him. For he shall delyuer ye pore that cryeth vnto hī / & the man in heuynesse without helpe. He shall haue pytie and mercy on the poore nedyons / and he shall kepe the soules of them that are in afflyction. He shall redeme their lyues from fraude and vyolence / and precyouse shall their blode be in his syght. He shall lyue and shall haue giuen him of the golde of Sheba / men shall blesse him all tymes & shall sprede his fame. And the erth shalbe so fruitefull that of an handfull of wheate there shall aryse suche plentie in the hylles / that it shall waue with the wynde lyke the thicke highe trees of Lybani / and shall growe forth before the cyte as thicke as grasse. His name shalbe euer spoken vpon whyles the sonne shall endure and shall go from one generation into a nother / thorowe hym shall all natyons be blessed & shall extolle him with praise. Praysed be the lorde god / god of Israell which alone doth meruelouse thinges.

Praysed be his gloriouse name / euery lande be fusfilled with his beautifull glorye. AMEN. AMEN.

For they are neither cōbred ne constrained to deth / but thei ar well lykynge / they thriue / and ar lusty. They are nat oppressed with heuynesse lyke other men / they knowe nat the sorowe and care that other men abyde. Wherfore pryde hath closed them roūde aboute / & they are clothed with vyolence as with garmentes. They are so full of felycite and welth that they swelle / they sette forthe them selues in the imagynatyons of their owne hertes.

They were but as a dreame of a man sodenly / awake / oh lorde / euyn their imagꝭ & pictures hast thou made spitfull in the cytie.

The sōnes of Ephraym well armed and good archers / turned their backes in battayle. They kepte nat touch wt god / they wolde nat lyue after his lawe.

               He cutte in sondre the rocke of stonne in

the deserte / and gaue thē drinke out therof lyke as out of a great depe water. He led ryuers forth of the stonne & made the waters to ronne lyke swete floudes. And yet for all this they synned agaynst him / & angred the most highest in the wildernes. They tempted god in their hertes / whā they asked meat to saue their lyues. And they spoke against god sayēg may god spreade vs a table here in the deserte? He smytte the stonne & there flowed out waters plētuously / but whether maye he lykwyse / said they / gyue vs also brede / and prepare flesshe for his people? Wherfore the lorde whan he herde these thinges was angry / and fyer was kyndled agaynst Iacob / & his wrath was bēte agaīst Israhell. And that bycause they beleued nat god / neither trusted they to his helpe. And yet he cōmaūded ye cloudes oboue / & openyd the dores of heuen. And powred thē downe MAN to ete he gaue thē heuenly fode. So yt man ete stronge & substācyally meat that cam frō the cloudꝭ / he let thē haue meat euē their belifull.

And they fel down īto the middꝭ of their tentes / & round about their tabernacles. And they eate / & were well fylled / for he satisfied their appetites. They were nat disapoynted of their luste / and yet their meate was no soner in theire mouthes / than the wrath of god fell vpon them. And slewe the chefe of theym: euyn the most stoutest of Israell he threw downe. But yet aboue al this they sīned against him / for they beleued nat his meruelouse dedes.

               Often tymes prouoked they hī to angre

in the deserte / & agreued him sore in the wyldernes. Agayne / they tempted god and casteth awaye him that maketh holy Israell. They forgot his strōge hande and the daye in the whiche he delyuered them from the troublouse oppressours. They forgote his myracles also / which he wrought in Aegypte / & his wonderful tokens which he shewed in ye felde of Tanis. Whan he turned their pondes & dyches into blode / & their ryuers also that they shulde nat drinke. He sent amonge them swarmes of flyes which deuoured them / and frogges to dystroye them. And he gaue the profyte of their grasse and corne to be eaten vp of wormes / and thei

                   labours to hote flyes. He beate downe their vynes with hayle stones / & their fygge trees were froste byten.
               He distroyed their cattell with hayle stones / and smitte downe their beestes with lyghtenyngꝭ. He sente into amonge thē the heuy indygnatyō of his hote wrath / the consumyng vengeance of his fearfull yre / anguyssh & vyolent wodnes by noyouse spirites. He hedged in the waye of his wrath / he spared nat their lyues frō deth but betoke them to pestilence.
               He smytte euery fyrst begotten in Egipt and what so euer they had most leyfe and

For a declaration of the fyrst parte of this Psal. and knowlege of these two wordes merci & faithfulnes / ye shall vnderstande that god of his mercy and goodnes fyrste promyseth / and for his truthes sake he performeth it / which faythfull performynge / the prophet calleth faythfulnes. wherfor these two wordes / mercy and faythfulnes / are comēly ioyned togyther in the Psalmes The tytle of the Psal.

               I shall smyte togyther his aduersaryes befor his face / & his haters shal I distroy. My mercy & my faythfulnes are with hī / and ī my name shal his power be exalted. I shall throwe the see vnder his power / & the floudes shalbe at his cōmaundement. He shall call vpon me sayeng / my father arte thou / my god / my sauynge defence.

Thou hast cast downe his walles / & turned his stronge defēces īto his gret feare They plucked & tore him / as many as passed foreby / he was brought to this state / that euen his owne neyghbours had him for a laughyng stocke.

Remēbre thy rebukes whiche are layde vpon thy seruauntes / o lorde) I receyued into myn owne bosom all the rebukes of moch people.

Which florisheth in the mornynge / and receyueth fresshe beautie / at euenynge it is cutte downe and withred. Uerily we are wasted with thy wrathe / and with thy feruente indignatyon ar we throwen downe.
               Thou haste layed our iniquyties before thy face / and our offences haste thou set in the lyghte of thy presens. All our dayes (thou beynge angry) shall slyde awaye / our yeres go away lyke a thought. The dayes of our yeres ar threscore and ten / & we be somewhat stronge / they are

foure score / and the beste of them are passed in synne and heuynes / swiftly we muste flye awaye. What man knoweth the power of thy wrath? but lyke as men feare the / so fele they thy indignation. Wherfore shewe vs playnly the nōbre of our dayes / that our herte myght gete some wysdome. Turne the lorde / how longe? be pleased / set thy herte at rest with thy seruantes. Fyll vs anone with thy mercy / & we shall tryumphe & reioyse all our dayes. Make vs glad for the dayes in ye which thou hast scourged vs / & for ye yeres in the whiche we suffred afflyctiōs.

Excepte ye lorde had helpte me / my soule had shortly dwelled in the place of silēce. But whan I thought / nowe my fote is slyden awaye / than thy mercy / oh lorde / helde me vp. These manyfolde & careful thoughtes brent me nat within so soore / but thy consolatyons refresshed agayne my soule moch more. For what hast thou to do with the feare of these flareryng dissemblers? whose maner is to fayne iniuries. They clustred & were wrapped togider agaynst the iust mānes soule & they shed deuelisshly the īnocētes blode But the lorde shall be a castell for me / in which I maye be safe / and my god is my rocke stōne in whom I may be defended.

Our fathers in Egipte regarded nat thy myracles / neither remēbred they thy manyfolde goodnes: they rebelled at the see euyn at the red see. And yet he saued thē for his names sake / to magnifye his gloryouse power. He rebuked roughly the red see & it was vpdried / and he led them

thorowe the depth lyke as thorowe a deserte. He preserued them from the handes of their aduersaryes / & redemed them from the power of their enemyes.
               And the waters ouerwhelmed their aduersaryes / so that nat one of theym was lefte a lyue. Than beleued they his wordes / and songe forth prayse vnto him. But full sone after forgote they his workes / they wolde nat abyde his pleasure. They were set a fyer wt lust in the deserte and they tempted god in the wyldernes. And he gaue thē their askīge / but with it he cast their bodyes into a consūptyon. They enuyed Moyses and angred hī in their tentes / and Aharon also the lordes saynte. Therth opened her selfe & swalowed in Dathan / & supte vp the congregation of Abyram. Fyer consumed their feloshyp / the flame brente vp thun godly.

               They were defyled thorowe their owne workes / & they were vnshamfased in their owne dedes. And the wrath of the lord was kyndled agaynst his people / and he turned his face from his herytage.
               And he betoke them into the handes of the gentyles / & they that hated thē were become their rulers. And their enemis oppressed them / & subdued them to their power. Many tymes he delyuered them and yet they rebelled his pleasur / & were worne out with their owne wyckednesse. And he behelde whan they were sore laide agaynst / and herde their lamentacion.

                  The argument into the .C.vij. Psal.
                  ¶ Here tho Prophet declareth all aduersyte to be sent in / & to be taken away also of god onely.
               
               COnfitemini. Magnify ye ye lorde / for he is gratious & of good mynde towarde vs / & his goodnes stādeth forth for vs for euer. Let them that are redemed of the lorde / euyn thē whom he hath losed from so narowe straītes praise him Whom he hath gathered from the partꝭ of therth / as from the Est and west / from the north & south. For whan they erre frō the way in the desert / & fynde no towne inhabited. And for honger & thyrst their soule famysheth in them They cry to the lorde in suche a narawe straynte / & he delyuereth thē from their distresse. And leadeth them into the ryght waye / which bringeth thē to the cyte inhabited Of this they magnifye the lorde for hys goodnꝭ / they publyshe his meruelous dedes amonge men. As whā he satisfieth a thristy soule / and replenysheth an hungry soule with good sustinaunce.
               But they that sit in derkenes / and in the

shadow of deth / in afflyction / and yerne. Because they rebelled agaynst the wordes of god / and casted away opprbriously the counsell of the most hyghest. Whose hertꝭ he tameth by afflyction / for they fall & there is nat one that wyll helpe them. They crye vnto the lorde in suche narowe straintes / and he delyuereth them from their distresse.
               For he ledeth them forth of derkenes / & from the shadowe of deth / and breketh of their bandes. And than they magnifye the lorde for his goodnes / and publyshe his meruaylous actes amonge the men. Whan he had broke the dores of stele / & distroyed the barres of yerne.
               Foles for their synnes / and wikednesses are scurged. Their mynde abhorreth all maner of meate / they are brought euen to dethes dore. And they crye vnto the lorde in to their narowe strainte / & he delyuereth them from their distresse.
               For he commaundeth with a worde / and healeth them / and delyuereth them from distruction nowe bey

               They offre vnto him the sacrifyce of praise / and shewe forth his workes with gret

triumphe. They entre into the see with shyppes / and labour and stryue in the brode rough waters. They also se the workes of the lorde / & his wondrefull thynges in the depe sees. For at his commaundement cometh forthe the stormye wynde / & lyfteth vp the waues of the see. And they nowe ryse vp into the heuens / and anone they fall downe into the depthes / so that their hertes are clene gone. They are throwē here and there / they ar tossed / they rele lyke dronken men / they ar at their wyttes ende. And they crye vnto the lorde in this narowe straint / and he thorow his helpe delyuereth them out of their distresse. For the stormy wynde auoideth / that the see myght be caume & her waues might be styll Than ar they glad that they are at rest / and he leadeth them forth vnto their pleasaunt hauen. And thā magnifye hey the lord for his goodnes / & publishe his meruelous actes amonge the men. And they extoll him in the congregation of the people / they prayse him in the presens of the elders. He that turneth the moyst and frutefull soyle into a drye deserte / & caryeth away waters from the thristy erth.
               And brīgeth frutefull soyle into barons for the offences of the dwellers therin.

Bringeth it so to passe / that the drie deserte be turned agayn in to moyst soyle / & waters boyle forth of ye chyrsty groūde. And there than setteth he these hongry and famisshed men / they prepare them cyties to be inhabited. They sowe the feldes / they plante the vynyardes / & they make frute and encrese of corne.
               He blesseth them and they ar encresed excedyngly / their catall fayle nat.
               And agayn / they are mynyshed / and cast downe with barones / disease / & sicknes. He maketh hygh princes to be of no reputacyon / and he maketh them to erre be wyde and strange places.
               But in the meane season he lyfteth vp ye pore man out of trouble / and maketh hī an housholde lyke a flocke of shepe.
               The rightwyse shall feare & be glad / & al men gyuē to shrewdenes shall stope their mouthes. Who is wyse? let him obserue & marke these thynges / & he shall parceyue the goodnesse of the lorde.

               Trust nat in princes which are but men / in whom there is no sauynge helth. Their breth goth forth of their bodyes / and by & by they are turned ī to their erth in the same day all their counsels perishe

Hapy is he that seketh helpe of ye god of Iacob / & whose hope is ye lorde / his god. Which hath made heuens and erth / the see / and what so euer ar contayned in thē which kepeth his promyse for euer. Which auengeth men vexed wrongfully whiche gyueth meate to the hungry / it is the lorde that loseth men in holde. The lorde gyueth lyghte to the blynde / the lorde lyfteth vp men oppressed / it is the lorde that loueth the rightwyse. The lorde kepeth stāgers / he lyfteth vp the yonge fatherles & the wydowes / and the purposꝭ of thūgodly he turneth vp so downe. The lorde shalbe kynge for euer whiche is thy god / o Sion / in to al ages.
               Prayse ye the lorde.

               LAudare dn̄m. Prayse ye the lorde for it is a plesaunt and a ioyefull thinge to prayse our god / there is no thinge so to be desyred as the prayse of hym. The lorde shall restore Ierusalē / & shall gather to gyther the scattered out lawes of Israell. He healeth the broken in herte / and caseth their heuy labours. He nombreth the sterres / & gyueth namꝭ to them all. Grace is our lorde & grace is

his power / his wyt may no mā cōprehēde The lorde lyfteth vp ye meke lowlyōs / & ye proude vngodlye he casteth downe to the groūde. Sīge ye to the lord wt thākes giuynge / synge ye vnto our god wt harpe. Which ouerledeth the heuens with cloudes / and prepayreth rayne for the erthe / and bringeth forth grasse in the hylles. Which gyueth cat all their foode / & meat also to the rauyns chekens calling for it. He delyteth nat in strength & stronge stedes / neyther hath he pleasure in ye trumpets of men. But his plesure is in them that feare him / & truste vpon his mercy. Praise yu the lorde o Ierusalē / prayse thi god o Siō. For it is he yt shal strēgthen the barres of thy gates / & shall lade thi cytesens within the with plētuouse gyftes. He endueth thy costes aboute the with pease / and satisfyeth the with the mooste purest floure of the wheate.
               He sendeth forth his pleasures in to the erth / his cōmaūdemētes rōne forth swiftly. He gyueth downe snowe lyke wulle / & the hore froste he scatreth lyke asshes. He casteth forthe his hayle lyke gobbetꝭ of bred / who maye abyde his colde? He sendeth forth his worde and melteth them awaye / he ledeth backe his wynde / and the waters droppe downe.
               It is he yt tolde his pleasurs to Iacob / &
vis ordynance and decrees vnto Israhel. With no natiō hath he thus delt / neither to any other dyd he publyshe his decrees.
