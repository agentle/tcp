            A
DISCOVERSE
OF LIFE AND
DEATH, WRITten
in french by PHIL.
MORNAY, Sieur du
Plessis Marly.
            
               IT seemes to
mee strange,
and a thing
much to bee
marueiled, that the laborer
to repose himself
hasteneth as it were the
course of the Sun: that

the Mariner rows with
al force t'attain the port
& with a ioyfull cry salutes
the descried land:
that the traueller is neuer
quiet nor content til
hee beat the end of his
voyage: and that we in
the meane while tyed
in this world to a perpetuall
taske, tossed with
continuall tēpest, tyred
with a rough and combersom
way, cannot yet
see the end of our labor
but with griefe, nor behold
our port but with
tears, nor approche our
home and quiet abode
but with horrour and

trembling. This life is
but a Penelopes webbe,
wherein we are alwaies
doing & vndoing: a sea
opē to all winds, which
somtime within, sometime
without neuer ceas
to torment vs: a wearie
iourny through extream
heats, & colds, ouer high
mountains, steep rocks,
& theeuish deserts. And
so wee tearme it, in weauing
at this web, in rowing
at this oar, in passing
this miserable way:
yet lo whē death comes
to end our work, when
shee stretcheth out her
armes to pull vs into

the port, when after so
many dangerous passages,
and loathsome lodgings
she would cōduct
vs to our true home and
resting place: in stead of
reioycing at the end of
our labor, of taking cō
               fort
at the sight of our
land, of singing at the
approach of our happie
mansion, we would fain
(who would beleeue it?)
retake our vvorke in
hand, we would againe
hoise saile to the winde,
and willingly vndertake
our iourney anew. No
more, then, remember
we our paines, our shipwracks

and dangers are
forgotten: we feare no
more the trauelles nor
the theeues. Contrariwise,
wee apprehende
death as an extreame
paine, wee doubt it as a
rocke, wee flie it as a
thiefe. Wee do as little
children, who al the day
complaine, and when
the medicin is brought
them, are no longer
sicke: as they, who (all
the weeke long) runne
vp & downe the streets
with paine of the teeth,
and seeing the Barber
comming to pull them
out, feel no more pain:

as those tender and delicate
bodies, who in a
pricking pleurisie complaine,
cry out, and cannot
stay for a Surgion,
and when they see him
whetting his Launcet
to cut the throat of the
disease, pul in their arms
& hide them in the bed,
as if hee were come to
kill them. Wee feare
more the cure then the
disease, the Surgion thē
the pain, the stroke thē
the impostume. Wee
haue more sense of the
medicines bitternesse
soone gone, then of a
bitter languishing long

continued: more feeling
of death the end of
our miseries, then the
endlesse miserie of our
life. And whence proceedeth
this folly and
simplicitie? we neither
knowe life, nor death.
We fear that we ought
to hope for, and wish
for that wee ought to
feare. Wee call life a
continuall death: and
death the issue of a liuing
death, and the entrance
of a neuer dying
life. Now what
good, I pray you, is ther
in life, that wee should
so much pursue it? or

what euill is there in
death, that wee should
so much eschue it? Nay
what euill is there not
in life? and what good
is there not in death?
Consider al the periods
of this life. We enter it
in teares, wee passe it in
sweate, wee ende it in
sorrowe. Great and little,
rich and poore, not
one in the whole world
that can plead immunitie
from this condition.
Man, in this point worse
then all other creatures,
is borne vnable to support
himselfe; neyther
receiuing in his first

yeares any pleasure, nor
giuing to others but annoy
and displeasure, and
before the age of discretion
passing infinit dangers: only herein le
                  •••
               
vnhappie then in other
ages, that hee hath no
sense nor apprehension
of his vnhappinesse.
Now, is there anie so
weake minded, that if it
were graunted him to
liue alwayes a childe,
would make account of
such a life? So then it is
euident, that not simply
to liue is a good; but wel
and happilie to liue. But
proceed. Growes hee?

with him grow his trauailes.
Scarcely is hee
come out of his nurses
hands, scarcely knowes
what it is to play, but he
falleth into the subiectiō
of some schoolemaster.
I speake but of those
which are best & most
precisely broght vp: Studies
he? it is euer with repining.
Playes hee? neuer
but with feare. This
whole age, while hee is
vnder the charge of another,
is vnto him but as
a prison: he only thinks,
and only aspires to that
time whē freed from the
mastership of another,

he may become master
of himself; pushing onward
(as much as in him
lyes) his age with his
shoulder, that soone he
may enioy his hoped liberty
Inshort, he desires
nothing more thē ye end
of this base age, and the
beginning of his youth.
And what else I pray
you is the beginning of
youth, but the death of
infancie? the beginning
of manhood, but the
death of youth? the beginning
of to morrow,
but the death of to day?
In this sort then desires
he his death, & iudgeth

his life miserable: and
so cānot be reputed in
any happinesse or contentment.
Behold him
now, according to his
wish, at liberty: in that
age, wherein Hercules
had the choise, to take
the way of vertue or of
vice, reason or passion
for his guide, and of
these two must take
one. His passion entertaines
him with'a thousand
delights, prepares
for him a thousād baits,
presentes him with a
thousand worldly pleasures
to surprize him:
and fewe there are that

are not beguiled. But
at the reckonings ende,
what pleasures are they?
pleasures full of vice,
which holde him still in
a restlesse feauer: pleasures
subiect to repentance,
like sweete meats
of hard digestion: pleasures
bought with pain
and peril, spent and past
in a moment, and followed
with a long & lothsom
remorse of conscience.
And this is the very
nature (if they be wel
examined) of al the pleasures
of this world. Ther
is in none so much sweetnes,
but ther is more bitternes: 
none so pleasant
to the mouth, but leavs
an vnsauoury after-taste
and loathsome disdain:
none (which is worse) so
moderated but hath his
corrosiue, & caries his punishment
in it self. I will
not here speak of the displeasures
cōfessed by al,
as quarelles, debates,
woundes, murthers, banishments,
sicknesse, peril,
wherinto sometimes
the incontinency, sometimes
ye insolency of this
ill guided age conducts
him. But if those that
seeme pleasures, be nothing
els but displeasurs:

if the sweetnes therof be
as an infusion of wormwood;
it is plain enough
what the displeasure
is they feele, and how
great the bitternes that
they taste. Behold in
sum the life of a young
man, who rid of the gouernmēt
of his parents,
abandons himselfe to
all liberty or rather bō
               dage
of his passion:
which, right like an vncleane
spirit possessing
him, casts him now into
the water, now into
the fire: sometimes
carries him cleane ouer
a rocke, and sometime

flings him headlong to
the bottome. Now, if
he take and follow reason
for his guide, beholde
on the other part
wonderfull difficulties:
he must resolue to fight
in euery parte of the
field, at euery step to be
in conflict, and at handstrokes;
as hauing his enemy
in front, in flanke,
and on the rerewarde,
neuer leauing to assaile
him. And what enimie?
al that can delight him,
all that hee sees neer, or
far off; brieflie the greatest
enemy of the world,
the world it selfe: But

which is worse, a thousand
treacherous and
daungerous intelligences
among his own forces,
& his passion within
himselfe desperate:
which, in that age
grown to the highest, awaits
but time, houre, &
occasiō to surprize him
& cast him into all viciousnes.
God onely and
none other can make
him choose this way:
God only can hold him
in it to the end: God only
can make him victorious
in all his combates.
And well wee see how
fewe they are that enter

into it, and of those few
how many that retire againe.
Followe the one
way or followe the other,
he must either subiect
himself to a tyrannicall
passion, or vndertake
a weary & cōtinual
combate, willingly cast
himself to destructiō, or
fetter himself as it were
in stocks, easily sink with
the course of the water,
or painfully swimme against
the streame. Loe
here the yong m̄, who
in his youth hath drunk
his full draught of the
worlds vain & deceiueable
pleasures, ouertakē
               
by them with such a
dull heauinesse, and astonishment,
as drunkeards
the morrow after a
feaste: either so out of
taste, that hee will no
more; or so glutted, that
he can no more: not able
without griefe to
speak, or think of them.
Loe him that stoutely
hath made resistance:
hee feeles himselfe so
wearie, and with this
continuall conflicte so
brused and broken, that
either hee is vpon the
point to yeeld himself,
or content to die, and so
acquit himselfe. And

this is all the good, all
the contentment of this
florishing age, by children
so earnestly desired,
and by olde folkes
so heartilie lamented.
Nowe commeth that
which is called perfect
age; in the which men
haue no other thoughts
but to purchase themselues
wisdome and rest.
Perfect indeed▪ but herin
onely perfect, that all
imperfections of humane
nature, hidden
before vnder the simplicity
of childhood or the
lightnesse of youth, appeare
at this age in their

perfection, We speake
of none in this place but
such as are esteemed
the wisest, & most happy
in the conceit of the
world. Wee played as
you haue seene in feare:
our shorte pleasures
were attended on with
long repentance. Be
hold, now present themselues
to vs auarice, and
ambition; promising, if
wee will adore them,
perfect contentment of
the goods and honours
of this world. And surely
ther are none but the
ture Children of the
Lord, who by the faire

illusions of the one or
the other cast not them
selues headlong from
the top of the pinnacle.
But in the end, what is
all this contentment?
The couetous man
makes a thousand voiages
by sea and by land:
runnes a thousand fortunes:
escapes a thousand
shipwracks, in perpetuall
feare and trauel:
and many times hee either
loseth his time, or
gayneth nothing but
sicknesses, gouts, & oppilatiōs
for the time to
come In ye purchase of
this goodly repose, hee

bestoweth his true rest;
and, to gaine wealth,
loseth his life. Suppose
hee hath gained in
good quantitie: that hee
hath spoyled the whole
East of pearles, and drawen
drie all the mines
of the West: will hee
therefore bee settled in
quiet? can hee say that
he is content? All charges
and iourneyes past,
by his passed paines hee
heapeth vp but future
disquietnesse both of
minde and body; from
one trauell falling into
nother, neuer ending,
but changing his miseries.

Hee desired to
haue them, and now
feares to lose them: he
got them with burning
ardour, & possesseth in
trembling cold: hee aduētured
among theeues
to seek them; & hauing
found them, theeues &
robbers on al sides, run
mainely on him: he la
               
                  •
               oured
to digge them
out of the earth, and
now is inforced to religge,
and rehide them▪
Finally, comming from
al his voiages, he comes
into a prison: and for an
end of his bodily trauels
is taken with endlesse

trauels of the mind. And
what, at length, hath
this poore soule attained,
after so many miseries?
This Diuell of couerise,
by his illusions,
& enchantments, bears
him in hand that hee
hath some rare and singular
thing▪ and so it
fareth with him, as
with those silly creatures
whō, the Diuel seduceth
vnder colour of
relieuing their pouerty,
who finde their hands
full of leaues, supposing
to finde them full of
crownes. He possesseth
or rather is possessed by

a thing, wherein is neither
force nor vertue;
more vnprofitable, and
more base, then the
least hearb of the earth:
Yet hath he heaped together
this vile excrement,
and so brurish is
grown, as therewith to
crowne his head, which
naturally hee shoulde
tread vnder his feet. But
howsoeuer it be, is hee
therwith content? Nay
(cōirariwise) lesse now,
then euer. We cōmend
most, those drinkes that
breede an alteration,
and soonest extinguish
thirst: and those meats,

which in least quantitie
do longest resist hūger.
Now hereof the more a
man drinkes, the more
he is a thirst; the more
hee eates, the more an
hungred: It is a dropsie
(and as they tearme it)
the dogs hunger: sooner
may hee burst then
be satisfied. And (which
is worse) so strange in
some is this thirst, that
it maketh them dig the
pittes, and painefully
draw the water, and after
will not suffer them
to drinke. In the middest
of a riuer they are
drie with thirst: and on

a heap of corne cry out
of famine: they haue
goods and dare not vse
them: they haue ioyes
it seemes, and doe not
enioy thē: they neither
haue for thēselues nor
for another: but of all
they haue, they haue
nothing: and yet haue
wāt of al they haue not.
Let vs then returne to
that that the attaining
of all these deceiueable
goods is nothing else
but wearinesse of body;
& the possession for the
most part, but wearines
of the mind: which
certainely is so much

the greater, as is more
sensible, more subtile,
and more tender the
soule then the body▪ But
the heap of al misery is,
when they come to lose
them; when either shipwrack,
or sacking or inuasion,
or fire, or such
like calamities, to which
these fraile thinges are
subiect, doth take and
carie them from them.
Then fall they to crie, to
weep, & to tormēt them
selues, as little children
that haue lost their plaigame;
which notwithstanding
is nothing
worth. One cannot perswade

them, that mortal
mē haue any other good
in this world, but that
which is mortall. They
are in their owne conceits
not onely spoyled,
but altogether slayed.
And, forasmuch as in
these vaine things they
haue fixt al their hopes;
hauing lost them, they
fall into despaire, out of
the which commonly
they cannot bee withdrawen.
And (which is
more) al, that they haue
not gained according
to the accountes they
made, they esteem lost:
all that, which turnes

them not to greate and
extraordinarie profite,
they account as damage:
whereby wee
see some fall into such
despaire, as they cast
away themselues. In
short, the recompence
that couetise yeeldes
those that haue serued it
all their life, is oftentimes
like that of the
Diuell: whereof the end
is, that after a small
time hauing gratified
his Disciples, eyther
gee giues them ouer to
a hangman, or himselfe
breaks their necks.
I wil not here discourse

of the wickednesse and
mischiefes whereunto
the couetous men subiect
themselues, to attaine
to these goodes,
whereby their conscience
is filled with a perpetuall
remorse, which
neuer leaues thē in quiet:
sufficeth that in this
ouer-vehemēt exercise,
which busieth and abuseth
the greatest part of
the world, the body is
slain, the mind is weakned,
the soule is lost
without any pleasure or
contentment.
            Come we to ambition,
which (by a greedinesse

of honour) fondly holdeth
occupied the greatest
persons: Think we
there to finde more?
nay rather, lesse. As the
one deceiueth vs, giuing
vs for al our trauel,
but a vile excrement of
the earth: so the other
repayes vs, but with
smoke and winde; the
rewardes of this being
as vaine, as those of that
were grosse. Both in the
one and the other, wee
fall into a bottomelesse
pit: but into this the fall
by so much the more
dangerous, as at the first
shew, the water is more

pleasant and cleare. Of
those that giue themselues
to court ambition,
some are greate about
Princes, others
commaunders of Armies:
both sortes, according
to their degree
you see saluted, reuerenced,
and adored of
those that are vnder
them. You see them
apparelled in purple,
in scarlet, and in cloth
of golde: it seemes,
at first sight, there is no
contentment in the
world but theirs. But
men knowe not, how
heauie an ounce of that

vaine honour weighes,
what those reuerences
cost them, and how
dearely they paye for
an ell of those rich stufs:
who knewe them well,
would neuer buy them
at the price. The one
hath attained to this degree,
after a long and
painefull seruice, hazarding
his life vpon euerie
occasion, with
losse oft times of a leg
or an arme, and that at
the pleasure of a Prince,
that more regards a hū
               dred
perches of ground
on his neighbors frontiers,
then the liues of

a hundred thousand
such as hee: vnfortunate,
to serue who loues
him not: and foolish,
to thinke himself in honour
with him, that
makes so litle reckening
to lose him for a thing
of no worth. Others
growe vp by flattering
a Prince, and long submitting
their tongues
& hands to say and do
without differēce whatsoeuer
they will haue
them: whereunto a
good minde can neuer
command it selfe. They
shall haue indured a
thousand iniuries, receiued

a thousand disgraces;
and as neere
as they seem about the
Prince, they are neuerthelesse
alwayes as the
Lyons keeper, who by
long patience, a thousand
feedinges, and a
thousand clawings, hath
made a fierce Lyon familiar;
yet giues him
neuer meate, but with
pulling backe his hand,
alwaies in feare least he
should catch him: and
if once in a yeare hee
bites him, hee sets it so
close, that he is paied for
a long time after. Such
is the ende of all Princes

fauourites. When a
Prince after song breathing
hath raised a mā to
greate height, hee
makes it his pastime, at
what time he seemes to
be at the top of his trauell,
to cast him downe
at an instant: when hee
hath filled him with all
wealth, hee wrings him
after as a sponge; louing
none but himselfe, and
thinking euerie one
made, but to serue, and
please him. These blind
Courtiers make themselues
belieue, that they
haue friendes, and manie
that honour them:

               
                  〈◊〉
                considering that

                  〈◊〉
                make 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
                  〈◊〉
                and honour euerie
bodi
                  •••
                so others
doe by them. Their superiours
disdaine them,
& neuer but with scorn
doe so much as salute
them▪ their inferiors salute
them, because they
haue neede of them (I
meane of their fortune,
of their foode, of their
apparell, not of their
person): and for their equals,
betweene whom
cōmonly friendship cō
               sists,
they enuie each other,
accuse each other,
crosse each other; continually

grieued either
at their owne harme, or
at others good. Now,
what greater hel is ther,
what greater torment,
than enuie? which in
truth is nought else but
a feauer Hectique of the
minde: so they are vtterly
frustrate of all
friendship, euer iudged
by the wisest the chiefe
& soueraigne good among
men. Will you
see it more clearely?
Let but Fortune turne
her backe, euerie man
turns from them: let hir
frowne, euerie man
lookes aside on them:

let them once be disroabed
of their triumphall
garment, no bodie will
any more know them.
Againe, let there be apparelled
in it the most
vnworthie, and infamous
whatsoeuer: euen
he without difficulty, by
vertue of his robe, shall
inherit all the honours
the other had don him.
In the meane time they
are puffed vp, and grow
proude, as the Asse
which caried the image
of Isis was for the honours
done to the Goddesse,
& regard not that
it is the fortune they

carrie which is honoured,
not themselues, on
whom as on Asses, many
times she wilbe caried.
But you will say: At
least so long as that fortune
endured, they were
at ease, & had their contentment;
& who hath
3. or 4. or more yeares
of happie time, hath
not bin al his life vnhappie.
True, if this bee to
be at ease, continually
to feare to bee caste
down from that degree,
whereunto they are raised:
and dayly to desire
with great trauell to
clime yet higher. Those

(my friend) whom thou
takest so well at their
ease, because thou seest
them but without, are
within farre otherwise.
They are faire built prisons,
full within of deep
ditches, and dungeons:
full of darkenesse, serpents
and tormentes.
Thou supposest them
lodged at large, and
they thinke their lodgings
strait. Thou thinkest
them very high, &
they thinke themselues
verie lowe. Now, as sick
is hee, and many times
more sicke, who thinks
himselfe so, then who

indeede is. Suppose
them to bee Kings: if
they thinke themselues
slaues, they are no better:
for what are wee
but by opinion? You
see them well followed
and attended: and euen
those whom they haue
chosen for their guarde,
they distrust. Alone or
in companie euer they
are in feare. Alone they
looke behinde them: in
company they haue an
eye on euery side of thē.
They drinke in gold and
siluer; but in those, not in
earth or glasse, is poyson
prepared and d
                  •
               unke.

They haue their beds
soft & well made: when
they lay them to sleepe
you shall not heare a
mouse stir in the chamber:
not so much as a fly
shal come neer their faces.
Yet neuerthelesse,
where the countrey man
sleeps at the fal of a great
riuer, at the noyse of a
market, hauing no other
bed but the earth, nor
couering but the heauēs,
these in the middest
of this silence and
delicacie, doe nothing
but turn frō side to side,
it seemes still that they
heare some bodie, their

rest it selfe is without
rest Lastly, wil you know
what the diuersitie is betweene
the most hardly
intreated prisoners and
them both are enchained,
both loaden with
letters, but that the one
hath them of iron, the
other of gold; and that
the one is tied but by the
body, the other by the
minde. The prisoner
drawes his fetters after
him, the courtier wears
his vpō him. The prisoners
minde sometimes
cōforts the paine of his
body, and sings in the
midst of his miseries: the

Courtier tormented in
mind, wearieth incessātly
his body, & can neuer
giue it rest. And as for
the contentment you imagine
they haue, you
are there in yet more deceiued.
You iudge and
esteeme them greate,
because they are raised
high: but as fondly, as
who shuld iudge a dwarf
great, for being set on
a Tower, or on the
toppe of a mountaine.
You measure (so good
a Geometrician you
are) the image with
his base, which were
conuenient (to knowe

his true height) to bee
measur'd by it self: wheras
you regarde not the
height of the image, but
the height of the place
it standes vppon. You
deeme them great (if in
this earth there can bee
greatnesse, which in respect
of the whole heauens
is but a point): But
coulde you enter into
their minds, you would
iudge, that neither they
are greate; true greatnesse
consisting in contempt
of those vaine
greatnesses, whereunto
they are slaues: nor seem
vnto themselues so, seeing

dayly they are aspiring
higher, and neuer
where they would bee.
Some one sets downe a
boūd in his mind; Could
I attain to such a degree,
lo, I were content: I
would then rest my selfe.
Hath hee attained it?
hee giues himselfe not
so much as a breathing:
hee would yet ascende
higher. That which
is beneath, hee counts a
toy: it is in his opinion
but one step. Hee reputes
himselfe lowe, because
there is some one
higher, in stead of reputing
himselfe high, because

ther be a milliō lower:
& so high he climes
at last, that either his
breath failes him by the
way, or he slides frō the
top to the bottom. Or is
he get vp by al his trauel
it is but as to find himself
on the top of the Alpes,
not aboue the cloudes,
windes and stormes: but
rather at the deuotion
of lightnings and tempestes,
and whatsoeuer
else horrible, and dangerous
is engendred, and
conceiued in the ayre:
which most commonly
taketh pleasure to thunderbolt
and dash into

powder that proude
height of theirs. It may
be herin you will agree
with mee, by reason of
the examples wherwith
both histories, & mens
memories are ful. But say
you, such at least whom
nature hath sent into the
world with crownes on
their heads, and scepters
in their hands: such as
from their birth she hath
set in that height, as they
neede take no paine to
ascende: seeme without
cōtrouersie exempt frō
all these iniuries, and by
consequence may call
themselues happie. It

may bee indeede they
feele lesse such incommodities,
hauing been
borne, bred, and brought
vp among them: as one
borne neere the downefals
of Nilus becomes
deafe to the founde: in
prison, laments not the
want of libertie: among
the Cimmerians in perpetuall
night, wisheth
not for dave: on the
top of the Alpes, thinks
not strange of the mists,
the tēpests, the snowes,
and the stormes. Yet
free doubtlesse they are
not, whē the lightening
often blasteth a flowre

of their crownes, or
breakes their scepter in
their hands: when a drift
of snowe ouerwhelmes
them: whē a mist of heauinesse,
and griefe, continually
blindeth their
wit and vnderstanding.
Crowned they are indeed;
but with a crowne
of thornes. They beare a
scepter: but it is of a reed
more then any thing in
the world pliable and obedient
to all windes: it
being so far off that such
a crowne can cure the
maigrims of the mind, &
such a scepter keepe off
and fray away the griefs

and cares which houer
about them; that it is
contrariwise the crown
that brings them, and
the scepter which from
al parts attracts them. O
crowne, said the Persian
Monarch, who knew
how heauie thou sittest
on the head, would not
vouchsafe to take thee
vp, though hee found
thee in his way. This
prince it seem'd gaue for
tune to the whole world,
distributed vnto men
haps and mishaps at his
pleasure could in show
make euery mā cōtent:
himselfe in the meane

while freely confessing,
that in the whole world,
which he held in his hād
there was nothing but
griefe, & vnhappinesse
And what wil al the rest
tell vs, if they list to vtter
what they foūd? We
will not aske them who
haue concluded a miserable
life with a dishonorable
death: who haue
beheld their kingdomes
buried before them, &
haue in greate miserie
long ouerliued their
greatnesse. Not of Dionyse
of Sicil, more content
with a handfull of
twigs to whip litle children

of Corinth in a
choole, then with the
scepter, wherewith he
had beaten al Sicil: nor
of Sylla, who hauing robbed
the whole State of
Rome, which had before
robbed the whole world,
neuer found meanes of
rest in himselfe, but by
robbing himselfe of his
owne estate, with incredible
hazard both of his
power & authority. But
demand we the opinion
of king Salomon, a man
indued withsingular gifts
of God, rich and wealthy
of all thinges. who
sought for treasure from

the Iles: He will teach vs
by a booke of purpose,
that hauing tried all the
felicities of the earth, he
found nothing but vanity,
trauell, & vexation of
spirit. Aske wee the Emperour
Augustus, who
peaceably possessed the
whole world: Hee will
bewaile his life past, and
amonge infinite toyles
wish for the rest of the
meanest mā of the earth:
accountinge that daye
most happie, when he
might vnload himself of
this insupportable greatnes,
to liue quietly amōg
he least. Of Tiberius his

successor, he wil cōfesse
vnto vs that hee holds y
                  •
               
Empire as a wolf by the
eares, and that (if without
danger of biting he
might) he would gladly
let it goe, complayning
on Fortune for lifting
him so high, & then taking
away the ladder,
that he could not come
down again. Of Dioclesian,
a Prince of so great
wisdome and vertue in
ye opinion of the world:
he wil prefer his voluntarie
banishmēt at Salona,
before al the Roman
Empire. Finally, the
Emperor Charles the

fift, esteemed by our
Age most happie that
hath liued these many
ages: hee will curse his
conquests, his victories,
his triumphes: and not
be ashamed to confesse
that farre more good in
comparison he hath felt
in one day of his Monkish
solitariness, then in
all his triumphant life.
Now, shall wee thinke
those happy in this imaginate
greatnesse, who
themselues think themselues
vnhappy? seeking
their happinesse in lessening
themselues, & not
finding in the world one

place to rest this greatnesse,
or one bed quietly
to sleep in? Happie is he
onely who in mind liues
contented: and hee most
of all vnhappie, whome
nothing he can haue can
content. Then miserable
Pyrrhus king of Albany,
who would winne al the
world, to win (as he said)
rest and went so farre to
seeke that which was so
neere him. But more
miserable, Alexander,
that being borne King
of a great Realme, and
Conqueror almost of
the earth, sought for
more worldes to satisfie

his foolish ambitiō, with
in three daies content
with sixe foot of groūd.
To conclude, are they
borne on the highest
Alpes? they seeke to
scale heauen. Haue they
subdued al the Kinges of
the earth? they haue
quarelles to plead with
God, and indeuour to
treade vnder foote his
kingdome. They haue
no ende nor limite, till
God laughing at their
vaine purposes, when
they thinke themselues
at the last step, thunderstriketh
al this presumption,
breaking in shiuers

their scepters in
their handes, and oftentimes
intrapping them
in their owne crownes.
At a word, whatsoeuer
happines can be in that
ambition promiseth, is
but suffering much il, to
get ill. Men thinke by
dayly climing higher to
pluck themselues out of
this ill: and the height
wherunto they so pamfully
aspire, is the height
of misery it self. I speak
not here of the wretchednes
of thē, who all
their life haue held out
their cap to receiue the
almes of Court fortune,

and can get nothing, often
with incredible hart
griefe, seeing some by
lesse pains takē haue riches
fal into their hāds:
of thē, who iustling one
another to haue it, lose
it, and cast it into the
handes of a third: Of
those, who holding it in
their hands to hold it faster,
haue lost it through
their fingers. Such by all
men are esteemed vnhappie,
& are indeed so,
because they iudge thē
               selues
so. It sufficeth that
al these liberalities, which
the Deuill casteth vs as
out at a window, are but

baits: all these pleasures
but ambushes: and that
hee doth but make his
sport of vs, who striue
one with another for
such things, as most vnhappy
is hee, that hath
best hap to finde them.
Well now, you will say,
the Couetous in all his
goods, hath no good:
the Ambitious, at the
best hee can bee, is but
ill. But may there not
be some, who supplying
the place of Iustice, or
being neere about a
Prince, may without following
such vnbridled
passions, pleasantly enioye

their goods, ioyning
honour with rest
and contentment of
minde? Surely, in former
ages (ther yet remaining
among men some sparks
of sinceritie) in some
sort it might bee so:
but being of that composition
they now are, I
see not how it may be in
any sort. For, deale you
in affaires of estate in
these times, either you
shal do wel, or you shall
do il. I fil, you haue God
for your enemy, & your
owne conscience for a
perpetually tormenting
executioner. If well, you

haue men for your enemies,
and of men the
greatest: whose enuy &
malice wil spie you out,
& whose cruelty & tyrā
               ny
will euermore threaten
you. Please the people,
you please a beast:
& pleasing such, ought
to be displeasing to your
selfe. Please your selfe,
you displease god: please
him, you incur a thousād
dangers in ye world, with
purchase of a thousand
displeasures. Wherof it
grows, that if you could
hear the talke of the wisest
and least discontent
of this kinde of men,

whether they speake aduisedly,
or their wordes
passe them by force of
truth, one would gladly
chāge garment with his
tenāt: another preacheth
how goodly an estate it
is to haue nothing: a
third, complaining that
his braines are broken
with the noise of Court
or Palace, hath no other
thought, but as soone as
he may to retire himself
thence. So that you
shall not see any but is
displeased with his own
calling, & enuieth that
of another: readie neuerthelesse
to repent him, if

a man should take him
at his word. None but is
wearie of the businesses
wherunto his age is subiect,
& wisheth not to be
elder, to free himselfe of
them: albeit otherwise
he keepeth off old age, as
much as in him lyeth.
            What must wee then
do in so great a contrariety
& cōfusiō of minds?
Must we, to find true humanitie,
flie the societie
of men, & hide vs in forrests
among wild beasts?
to auoyde these vnruly
passions, eschue the assē
               bly
of creatures supposed
reasonable? to plucke

vs out of the euils of the
worlde, sequester our
selues from the world?
Could wee in so doing
liue at rest, it were something.
            But alas! men cannot
take heerein what part
they would: and euen
they which doe, finde
not there all the rest
they sought for. Some
would gladly do: but
shame of the world recals
them. Fooles, to
bee ashamed of what
in their harts they condemne:
& more fooles,
to bee aduised by the
greatest enemie they

can or ought to haue.
Others are borne in
hand that they ought to
serue the publicke; not
marking, that who coū
               sel
thē, serue onely them
selues: and that the
more part would not
much seek the publicke,
but that they found their
owne particular. Some
are told, that by their
good exāple they may
amend others: and consider
not that a hundred
sound men, euen Physicians
themselues, may
sooner catch the plague
in an infected Towne,
then one bee healed:

that it is but to to tempt
God, to enter therein:
that against so contagious
an ayre there is no
preseruatiue, but in getting
far from it. Finally,
that as little as the fresh
waters, falling into the
sea, canne take from it
his saltnesse: so little
canne one Lot or two,
or three, reforme a
Court of Sodome. And
as cōcerning the wisest,
who (no lesse careful for
their soules, then bodies)
seek to bring them
into a sound and wholesome
ayre, far from the
infection of wickednes:

and who ledde by the
hand of some Angell of
God, retire themselues
in season, as Lot into
some little village of
Segor, out of the corruption
of the worlde, into
some Countrey place
frō the infected townes,
there quietly employing
the time in some
knowledge and serious
contemplatiō: I willingly
yeelde they are in a
place of lesse danger, yet
because they carrie the
dāger in themselues, not
absolutely exempt from
danger. They flie the
court; & a court follows

them on all sides: they
endeuour to escape the
world; and the worlde
pursues them to death.
Hardly in this Worlde
can they finde a place
where the Worlde
findes them not: so greedily
it seekes to murther
them. And if
by some speciall grace
of God they seem for a
while free from these
dangers, they haue som
pouertie that troubles
them, some domesticall
debate that tormēts
them, or some familiar
spirit that tempts them:
briefly, the world dayly

in some sort or other
makes it selfe felt of
them. But the worst is,
whē we are out of these
externall warres and
troubles, we finde great
ciuill warre within our
selues; the flesh against
the spirit, passion against
reason, earth against
heauen, the world within
vs fighting for the
world, euermore so lodged
in the bottome of
our owne hearts, that on
no side we can flie from
it. I will say more: hee
makes profession to flie
the world, who seekes
thereby the prayse of

the world: hee faineth to
run away, who according
to the prouerbe; by
drawing back sets himselfe
forwarde. hee refuseth
honours, that
would thereby be praied
to take them: and
hides him from men, to
the end they should com
to seeke him. So the
world often harbours in
disguised attire among
them that fly the world.
This is an abuse. But follow
we the company of
men, the world hath his
Court among thē: seek
wee the Deserts, it hath
there his dens & places

of resort, and in the
Desert it selfe tempteth
Christ lesus. Retire we
our selues into our selues,
wee finde it there as vnclean
as any where. We
cannot make the world
dye in vs, but by dying
our selues. Wee are in
the world, and the world
in vs, and to separate vs
from the world, we must
separate vs from our
selues. Now this separation
is called Death. We
are, we think, come out
of the contagious City▪
but wee are not aduised
that we haue sucked the
bad ayre, that we carrie

the plague with vs, that
we so participate with it,
that through rockes,
through deserts, through
mountaines, it euer accompanieth
vs. Hauing
auoyded the contagion
of others, yet we haue it
in our selues. We haue
withdrawen vs out of
men, but not withdrawn
man out of vs. The tēpestuous
sea tormēts vs: we
are grieued at the heart,
& desirous to vomit: and
to be discharged therof,
we remoue out of one
ship into another, from
a greater to a lesse: wee
promise our selues rest

in vaine: they being alwaies
the same windes
that blowe, the same
waues that swell, the
same humors that are
stirred. To all, no other
port, no other meane
of trāquillitie but onely
death. We were sicke in
a chāber neer the street,
or neere the market: wee
caused our selues to bee
carried into some backer
closet, where the
noise was not so great.
But though there the
noyse was lesse: yet was
the feauer there neuer
the lesse: and therby lost
nothing of his heate.

Change bed, chamber,
house, countrey, againe
and again: we shal euery
where find the same vnrest,
because euery where
we finde our selues: and
seeke not so much to be
others, as to bee other
wheres. Wee follow solitarinesse,
to fly carefulnesse.
We retire vs (so
say wee) from the wicked:
but cary with vs our
auarice, our ambition,
our riotousnesse, all
our corrupt affections:
which breed in vs 1000.
remorses▪ & 1000. times
each day bring to our remembrance
the garlike

& onions of Egypt. Daily
they passe the Ferrie
with vs: so that both on
this side, and beyond the
water, we are in cōinuall
combat. Now could
we cassere this company
which eates and gnawes
our mind, doubtlesse we
should be at rest, not in
solitarinesse onely, but
euen in the thicket of
men. For the life of
man vppon earth is
but a continuall warrefare.
Are wee deliuered
from externall practices?
wee are to take
heede of internall espialles.
Are the Greekes

gone away? wee haue a
Sinon within, that wil be
tray them the place. We
must euer be waking, hauing
an eie to the watch,
and weapons in our
hands, if wee will not
euerie houre be surprised,
and giuen vp to the
wil of our enemies. And
how at last can wee escape?
Not by the woods,
by the riuers, nor mountains:
not by throwing
our selues into a presse,
nor by thrusting our
selues into a hole. One
onely meane there is,
which is death: which in
the ende separating our

spirit frō our flesh, the
pure and cleane part of
our soule from the vncleane,
which within vs
euermore bandeth it self
for the world, appeaseth
by this separation that,
which conioyned in one
& the same person could
not, without vtter choaking
of the spirit, but be
in perpetuall contention.
            And as touching the
contentment that may
be in the exercises of the
wisest men in their solitarines,
as reading diuine
or prosane books, with
all other knowledges

and learnings: I holde
well that it is indeede a
farre other thing, then
are those mad huntings,
which make sauage a
multitude of mē possessed
with these or the like
diseases of the mind. Yet
must they all abide the
iudgement pronounced
by the wisest among the
wise, Salomon, that al this
neuerthelesse applied to
mans naturall disposition,
is to him but vanitie
and vexation of
minde. Some are euer
learning to correct their
speech, and neuer think
of correcting their life.

Others dispure in their
Logique of reason, and
the Arte of reason: and
lose therby many times
their naturall reason.
One learnes by Arithmeticke
to diuide, to the
smallest fractions, and
hath not skil to part one
shilling with his brother.
Another by Geometrie
canne measure
fieldes, and townes, and
Countreyes: but cannot
measure himselfe. The
Musician can accord his
voices, and soundes, and
times together: hauing
nothing in his heart but
discords, nor one passion

in his soule in good tune.
The Astrologer lookes
vp on highe, and falles
in the next ditch: foreknowes
the future, and
sorgoes the presēt: hath
often his eye on the heauens;
his heart long before
buried in the earth.
The Philosopher discourseth
of the nature of all
other things: & knowes
not himselfe. The Historian
canne tell of the
warres of Thebes and of
Troy: but what is done
in his owne house can
tell nothing. The Lawyer
will make lawes for
all the worlde, and not

one from himselfe. The
Physician will cure others,
and be blind in his
owne disease: finde the
least alteration in his
pulse, and not marke the
burning feauers of his
minde. Lastly, the Diuine
wil spend the greatest
part of his time in
disputing of faith, and
cares not to hear of charity,
wil talke of God, &
not regarde to succour
men. These knowledges
bring on the minde an
endlesse labour, but no
contentment: for the
more one knowes, the
more he would know.
            
               They pacifie not the
debates a man feeles in
himselfe, they cure not
the diseases of his mind.
They make him learned
but they make not him
good: cunning but not
wise. I say more: The
more a man knowes, the
more knowes he that he
knowes not: the fuller
the mind is, the emptier
it findes it selfe: forasmuch
as whatsoeuer a
man can know of anie
science in this world, is
but the least part of
what he is ignorant: all
his knowledge cōsisting
in knowing his ignorance,

all his perfection
in noting his imperfections;
which who best
knowes and notes, is in
truth among men the
most wise and perfect. In
short, we must conclude
with Salomon, that the
beginning and ende of
wisedome is the feare of
God: that this wisedome
neuerthelesse is taken of
the world for meere follie,
and persecuted by
the world as a deadly enemie:
and that as who
feareth God, ought to
feare no euil, for that all
his euils are conuerted to
his good: so neither

ought hee to hope for
good in the world, hauing
there the diuell his
professed enemy, whom
the Scripture tearmeth
Prince of the world.
            But with what exercise
soeuer wee passe
the time, behold old age
vnwares to vs comes vpon
vs: which whether
we thrust our selues into
the prease of men, or
hide vs some where out
of the way, neuer failes
to finde vs out. Euerie
man makes account in
that age to rest himselfe
of all his trauailes without
further care, but to

keep himself at ease & in
health. And see contrawise
in this age, there is
nothing but an after tast
of al the foregoing euils:
and most commonly a
plentifull haruest of all
such vices, as in ye whole
course of their life hath
held & possessed them.
There you haue the vnhabilitie
and weakenesse
of infancy, and (which
is worse) many times
accompanied with authoritie:
there you are
payed for the excesse
& riotousnes of youth,
with gowtes, palsies,
and such like diseases,

which take from you
limme after limme, with
extreame paine and
torment. There also
you are recompenced
for the trauels of mind,
the watchings & cares
of manhoode, with
losse of sight, losse of
hearing, and all the senses
one after another,
except only the sense of
paine. Not one parte
in vs but death takes ingage
to be assured of vs,
as of bad pay masters,
which infinitely feare
their dayes of payment.
Nothing in vs that will
not by and by bee dead:

& neuerthelesse our vices
yet liue in vs; & not
onely liue, but in despite
of Nature dayly
growe young againe.
The couetous man hath
one foote in his graue,
and is yet burying his
money: meaning belike
to finde it againe another
day. The ambitious
in his Will ordaineth
vnprofitable pōps
for his funerals, making
his vice to liue and triumphe
after his death.
The riotous, no longer
able to daunce on his
feete, daunceth with his
shoulders: all vi
                  •
               es hauing

left him, and hee
not yet able to leaue
them. The childe wisheth
for youth and this
man laments it. The
young man liueth in
hope of the future: and
this feeles the euill present,
lamentes the false
pleasures past, and sees
for the time to come
nothing to hope for;
More foolish then the
child, in bewailing the
time hee cannot recall,
& not remembring the
euill he had therein: and
more wretched then the
young man, in that after
a wretched life not able

but wretchedly to d
                  ••
               
hee sees on all sides b
                  ••
               
matter of despaire. As
for him, who from his
youth hath vndertaken
to combate against the
fleshe, and against the
World: who hath taken
so great paines to mortifie
himselfe and leaue
the World before his
time: who besides those
ordinary euilles findes
himself vexed with this
great and incurable disease
of olde age, and
feeles notwithstanding
his fleshe, how weake
soeuer, stronger oftentimes
then his spirit:

what good I pray
can hee haue but onely
herein; that hee sees his
death at hand, that hee
sees his combate finished
that hee sees himselfe
readie to depart by
death out of this loathsome
prison, wherein
all his life time hee hath
beene racked and tormented?
I will not here
speak of the infinit euils
wherewith men in all
ages are annoyed, as
losse of friends and parents,
banishments, exiles,
disgraces, and such
others, common and
ordinarie in the world:

one cōplaining of loosing
his children, another
of hauing them▪
one making sorrow for
his wiues death, another
for his life: one finding
fault, that he is too high
in court another that he
is not high enough. The
world is so full of euills,
that to write of all, wold
require another world
as great as it selfe. Sufficeth,
that if the most
happie in mens opinions
doe counterpo
                  •
               z
                  •
               
his haps with his mishappes,
hee shall iudge
himselfe vnhappie: and
hee iudge him happie,

who had hee beene set
three dayes in his place,
woulde giue it ouer to
him that came next:
yea, sooner then hee,
who shall consider, in
all the goods that euer
he hath had, the euils he
hath endured to get thē,
and hauing them to retaine
and keepe them (I
speake of the pleasures
that may bee kept, and
not of those that wither
in a moment) will
iudge of himselfe, and
by himselfe, that the
keeping it selfe of the
greatest felicitie in this
world, is full of vnhappinesse

and infelicitie.
Conclude then, that
Childe-hood is but a
foolish simplicity; youth
a vaine heate; manhood,
a painefull carefulnesse;
and olde age, a
noisome languishing:
that our playes are but
tears, our pleasures feauers
of the minde, our
goods, rackes, and tormentes,
our honours
heauie vanities, our rest,
vnreste: that passing
from age to age, is but
passing from euill to
euill, and from the lesse
vnto the greater: & that
alwayes it is but one

waue driuing on another,
vntill we be arriued
at the hauen of death.
Conclude I say, that life
is but a wishing for the
future, and a bewailing
of the past: a loathing
of what we haue tasted,
and a longing for that
wee haue not tasted: a
vaine memorie of the
state past, and a doubtfull
expectation of the
state to come: Finally,
that in all our life there
is nothing certaine, nothing
assured, but the
certaintie & vncertainty
of death. Behold, now
comes death vnto vs:

Behold hir, whose approache
wee so much

                  •
               eare. Wee are now to
consider whether shee
be such as we are made
belieue: and whether
wee ought so greatly to
flie hir, as commonly
we doe. We are afraid
of her: but like little
children, of a vizor, or
of the Images of Hecate.
We haue hir in horror;
but because we cōceiue
her not such as shee is,
but ougly, terrible, and
hideous: such as it pleaseth
the Painters to
represent vnto vs on a
wall. Wee flie before

hir: but it is, because
(foretaken with such
vaine imaginations) we
giue not our selues leisure
to marke hir. But
stay wee, stand we stedfast,
looke we hir in the
face▪ wee shall finde hir
quite other then shee is
painted vs, and altogether
of other countenaunce
then our miserable
life. Death makes
an end of this life. This
life is a perpetuall miserie
and tempest: Death
then is the issue of our
miseries and entraunce
of the port where wee
shall ride in safetie from

all windes. And should
wee feare that which
withdraweth vs from
misery, or which drawes
vs into our hauen? Yea
but you will say, it is a
paine to dye. Admit it
bee: so is there in curing
of a wound: Such
is the Worlde, that
one euill cannot bee
cured but by another;
to heale a contusion,
must bee made an incision.
You will say, there
is difficultie in the passage:
So is there no hauen,
no port, whereinto
the entraunce is not
straite and combersom.

No good thing is to bee
bought in this World
with other thē the coyne
of labour & paine. The
entrance indeed is hard,
if our selues make it
hard, comming thither
with a tormented spirit,
a troubled minde, a wauering
and irresolute
thought. But bring we
quietnes of minde, constancie,
and full resolution,
wee shall not finde
any danger or difficultie
at all. Yet what is the
paine that death brings
vs? Nay, what can shee
do with those paines we
feele? Wee accuse hir

of all the euils we abide
in ending our life, and
consider not how manie
more woundes or
grieuous sickenesses we
haue endured without
death: or how many
more vehement paines
we haue suffered in this
life, in the which wee
called euen hir to our
succour. All the paines
our life yeeldes vs, at
the last houre wee impute
to death: not
marking, that life begun
and continued in al sorts
of paine, must also necessarily
ende in paine.
Not marking (I say) that

it is the remainder of
our life, not death that
tormenteth vs: the end
of our nauigation that
paines vs, not the hauen
wee are to enter:
which is nothing else
but a safegarde against
all windes. We complaine
of death, where
wee should complaine
of life: as if one hauing
beene long sicke, and
beginning to bee well,
should accuse his health
of his last paines, and
not the reliques of his
disease. Tell me, what
is it else to bee deade,
but to bee no more liuing

in the world? Absolutely
and simplie not
to bee in the World,
is it any paine? Did
wee then feele anie
paine, when as yet
wee were not? Haue
wee euer more resemblance
of Death, then
when wee sleepe? Or euer
more rest, then at
that time? Now if this
be no paine, why accuse
wee death of the paines
our life giues vs at our
departure? vnlesse also
wee will fondly accuse
the time when as yet we
were not, of the paines
wee felt at our birth. If

the comming in be with
teares, is it wonder that
such bee the going out?
If the beginning of our
being, bee the beginning
of our paine, is it
maruell that such be the
ending? But if our not
being in times past hath
beene without paine, &
all this being contrariwise
full of paine: whom
should we by reason accuse
of the last paines?
the not being to come,
or the remnant of this
present beeing? Wee
thinke we dye not, but
when we yeelde vp our
last gaspe. But if wee

mark well, wee dye euerie
daie, euerie houre,
euery moment. Wee
apprehende death as a
thing vnusual to vs: and
yet haue nothing so cō
               mon
in vs. Our liuing
is but continuall dying:
looke how much wee
liue, we dye how much
we increase, our life decreases.
We enter not
a step into life, but wee
enter a step into death.
Who hath liued a third
part of his yeares, hath
a third part of himselfe
dead: VVho halfe his
yeares, is already halfe
dead. Of our life, all

the time past is dead, the
present liues and dyes
at once, and the future
likewise shall dye. The
past is no more, the future
is not yet, the present
is, and no more
is. Briefly, this whole
life is but a death: it is as
a candle lighted in our
bodies: in one the wind
makes it melte awaie,
in another blowes it
cleane out, many times
ere it bee halfe burned:
in others it endureth
to the ende.
Howesoeuer it bee,
looke howe much it
shineth, so much it

burneth: hir shining
is her burning: her
lighte is a vanishing
smoke: her last fire,
her last wike, and her
last droppe of moisture.
So is it in the life of man,
life and death in man is
all one. If wee call the
last breath death, so
must wee all the rest: all
proceeding from one
place, and all in one
manner. One onely
difference there is between
this life, and that
we call death: that during
the one, wee haue
alwaies whereof to die:
and after the other, ther

remaineth only whereof
to liue. In summe, euen
hee that thinketh
death simply to bee the
end of man, ought not
to feare it: in asmuch as
who desireth to liue
long, desireth to dye
longer: and who feareth
soone to dye, feareth
(to speake properly)
least he may not longer
dye.
            But vnto vs, brought
vppe in a more holie
schoole, death is a far
other thing: neither
need we, as the Pagans,
of consolations against
death: but that death

serue vs as a consolation
against all sorts of affliction:
so that we must
not onely strengthen
our selues, as they, not
to feare it, but accustom
our selues to hope for it.
For vnto vs it is not a
departing from paine
and euill, but an accesse
vnto all good: not the
ende of life, but the ende
of death, and the beginning
of life. Better,
saith Salomon, is the day
of death, then the day of
birth: and why? because
it is not to vs a last day,
but the dawning of an
euerlasting day. No

more shall wee haue,
in that glorious light,
either sorrowe for the
past, or expectation of
the future: for al shal be
there present vnto vs, &
that present shall neuer
more passe. No more
shall wee powre out our
selues in vaine and painfull
pleasures: for wee
shal bee filled with true,
and substantiall pleasures.
No more shall we
paine our selues in heaping
togither these exhalatiōs
of the earth; for
the heauēs shall be ours:
and this masse of earth,
which euer drawes vs towardes

the earth, shall
bee buried in the earth.
No more shall we ouerwearie
our selues with
mounting from degree
to degree, and from honour
to honour: for wee
shall highly bee raised aboue
all heights of the
world; and, from on
high, laugh at the folly
of all those wee once
admired, who fight together
for a point, & as
little children for lesse
then an apple. No more
(to be briefe) shall we
haue cōbats in our selues:
for our flesh shal be dead,
and our spirit in full life:

our passion buried,
and our reason in perfect
libertie. Our soule,
deliuered out of this
foule and filthie prison,
(where, by long continuing,
it is growen
into an habite of crookednesse)
shall againe
drawe her owne breath,
recognize her auncient
dwelling, and againe
remember her
former glory and dignity.
This flesh (my friend)
which thou feelest, this
body which thou touchest,
is not man. Man is
from heauen: heauen
is his countrey and his

ayre. That hee is in his
body, is but by way of
exile and confinement.
Man indeede is soule &
spirit: Man is rather of
celestial and diuine qualitie,
wherein is nothing
grosse nor material. This
body, such as now it is, is
but the barke and shell
of the soule: which
must necessarily be broken,
if wee will be hatched:
if we will indeed
liue and see the light.
Wee haue, it seemes,
some life, & some sense
in vs: but are so crooked
and contracted, that
wee cannot so much as

stretch out our wings,
much lesse take our
flight towardes heauen,
vntill wee bee disburthened
of this earthly
burthen. Wee looke,
but through false spectacles:
wee haue eyes,
but ouer growen with
pearles: wee thinke we
see, but it is in a dreame,
wherein we see nothing
but deceit. All that wee
haue, and all that wee
knowe, is but abuse and
vanitie. Death onely can
restore vs both life and
light: and we thinke (so
blockish we are) that she
comes to rob vs of thē.
            
               We say we are Christians:
that we beleeue,
after this mortall, a life
immortall: that death is
but a separation of the
bodie and soule: and that
the soule returnes to her
happie abode, there to
ioy in God, who onely is
all good: that at the last
day it shall againe take
the body, which shall
no more bee subiect to
corruption. With these
goodly discourses wee
fill all our bookes: and in
the mean while, when it
comes to the point, the
verie name of death as
the horriblest thing

in the World makes vs
quake and tremble. If
we beleeue as we speak,
what is that wee feare?
to bee happie? to bee at
our ease? to bee more
content in a momēt, thē
we might be in the longest
mortall life that
might be? or must not we
of force confesse, that we
beleeue it but in part?
that all wee haue is but
wordes? that all our
discourses, as of these
hardy trencher-knights,
are but vaunting and vanitie?
Some you shall
see, that will say: I
knowe well that I

passe out of this life
into a better; I make
no doubte of it: onely
I feare the midway
step, that I am to step
ouer. Weake hearted
creatures! they will kill
themselues, to gette their
miserable liuing: suffer
infinite paines, and infinite
woundes at another
mans pleasure: passe infinite
deathes without
dying, for things of
nought, for thinges that
perish, and perchance
make them perish with
them. But when they
haue but one pase to
passe to bee at rest,

not for a day, but for
euer; not an indifferent
rest, but such as
mans minde cannot
comprehend: they tremble,
their harts fail them,
they are affraide: and yet
the grounde of their
harme is nothing but
feare. Let them neuer
tell mee, they apprehend
the paine: it is but
an abuse; a purpose to
conceale the little faith
they haue.
            No, no, they would
rather languish of the
gowte, the sciatica, anie
disease whatsoeuer: then
dy one sweet death with

the least paine possible:
rather pyningly dye
limme after limme,
out-liuinge as it were,
all their senses, motions,
and actions, then
speedily dye, immediatly
to liue for euer. Let
them tell mee no more
that they would in this
worlde learne to liue:
for euerie one is thereunto
sufficiently instructed
in himselfe, and not
one but is cunning in the
trade.
            Nay rather they should
learne in this Worlde to
dye; and once to dye wel,
dye dayly in themselues:

so prepared, as if the end
of euerie dayes worke,
were the ende of our
life. Now contrariwise
there is nothing to their
eares more offensiue
then to heare of death.
Senselesse people! wee
abandon our life to
the ordinarie hazardes
of warre, for seauen
frankes pay: are formost
in an assault, for a
little bootie: goe into
places whence there is
no hope of returning,
with daunger manie
times both of bodies
and soules. But to
free vs from all hazards,

to winne thinges inestimable,
to enter an eternall
life, wee faint in the
passage of one pase,
wherein is no difficultie,
but in opinion: yea, wee
so faint, that were it not
of force wee must passe,
and that God in despite
of vs will doe vs a good
turne, hardly should
wee finde in all the
World one, how vnhappie
or wretched soeuer,
that would euer
passe.
            Another will say,
had I liued till fiftie or
sixtie yeares, I should
haue beene contented, I

should not haue cared to
liue longer: but to dye
so young is no reason. I
should haue knowen the
world before I had left
it. Simple soule! in this
worlde there is neither
young nor old.
            The longest age in
comparison of all▪ that
is past, or all that is to
come, is nothing: and
when thou hast liued
to the age thou nowe
desirest, all the past will
bee nothing: thou wilt
still gape for that is to
come. The past will
yeelde thee but sorrow,
the future but expectation,

the present noe
contentment. As readie
thou wilt then be to
redemaund longer respite,
as before. Thou
fliest thy creditour from
moneth to moneth,
and time to time, as
ready to pay the last
day, as the first: thou
seekest but to bee acquitted.
            Thou hast tasted all
which the worlde esteemeth
pleasures: not
one of them is new vnto
thee. By drinking oftener,
thou shalt bee
neuer a white the more
satisfied: for the body

thou cariest, like the bored
paile of Danaus
daughters, will neuer be
full. Thou mayst sooner
weare it out, then
wearie thy selfe with
vsing or rather abusing
it.
            Thou crauest long life
to cast it away, to spende
it on worthlesse delights,
to misspend it on
vanities. Thou art couetous
in desiring, and
prodigall in spending▪
Say not thou findest fault
with the Court, or the
Palace: but that thou
desirest longer to serue
the Common wealth, to

serue thy Countrey, to
serue GOD. Hee
that set thee on worke
knowes vntill what day,
and what houre, thou
shouldest bee at it: hee
well knowes how to direct
his worke. Should
hee leaue thee there
longer, perchance thou
wouldest marre all. But
if hee will pay thee liberally
for thy labour,
as much for halfe a
dayes worke, as for
a whole: as much for
hauing wrought till
noone, as for hauing
borne all the heate of
the day: art thou not

so much the more to
thanke and prayse him?
but if thou examine
thine owne conscience,
thou lamentest not the
cause of the widow, and
the orphane, which
thou hast left depending
in iudgement: not
the dutie of a sonne, of
a father, or of a friend,
which thou pretendest
thou wouldest perform:
not the ambassage for
the Common wealth,
which thou wert euen
readie to vndertake: not
the seruice thou desirest
to doe vnto God, who
knowes much better

how to serue him-selfe
of thee, then thou of thy
selfe.
            It is thy houses and
gardens thou lamentest,
thy imperfect plots and
purposes, thy life (as
thou thinkest) imperfecte:
which by noe
dayes, nor yeares, nor ages,
might be perfected:
and yet thy selfe mightest
perfecte in a moment,
couldest thou
but thinke in good earnest
that where it ende it
skils not, so that it ende
well.
            Now to ende wel this
life, is only to ende it

willingly: followinge
with full consent the
will and direction of
God, and not suffering
vs to bee drawen
by the necessitie of destinie.
            To end it willingly, we
must hope, and not feare
death. To hope for it,
wee must certainely
looke, after this life, for
a better life. To looke
for that, wee must feare
God: whom whoso well
feareth, feareth indeede
nothing in this world,
and hopes for all things
in the other. To one
well resolued in these

points, death canne be
but sweete and agreeable:
knowing, that
through it hee is to
enter into a place of all
ioyes,
            The griefe that may
bee therein shall bee
allaied with sweetnesse:
the sufferaunce of ill,
swallowed in the confidence
of good: the
sting of Death it selfe
shall bee dead, which
is nothinge else but
Feare. Nay, I will say
more, not onely all the
euilles conceiued in
death shall bee to him
nothing: but hee shall

euen scorne alll the
mishappes men redoubt
in this life, and
laugh at all these terrours.
            For I pray what can
he feare, whose death is
his hope? Thinke wee to
banish him his coūtrey?
Hee knowes hee hath a
Countrey otherwhere,
whence wee cannot banish
him: and that all
these countreyes are but
Innes, out of which hee
must part at the will of
his host.
            To put him in prison?
a more straite prison he
cannot haue, then his

owne bodie, more filthie,
more darke, more
full of rackes and torments.
            To kill him and take
him out of the world?
thats it he hopes for: that
is it with all his heart hee
aspires vnto. By fire, by
sworde, by famine, by
sickenesse? within three
yeares, within three
dayes, within three
houres, all is one to him:
all is one at what gate,
or at what time he passe
out of this miserable
life. For his businesses
are euer ended, his affaires
all dispatched;

and by what way he shal
go out, by the same hee
shall enter into a most
happie and euerlasting
life.
            Men canne threaten
him but death, and
death is all hee promiseth
himselfe: the worst
they canne doe, is, to
make him dye, and that
is the best hee hopes for.
The threatninges of
tyrants are to him promises,
the swordes
of his greatest enemies
drawen in his fauour:
for as much as hee
knowes that threatning
him death, they threaten

him life: and the
most mortall woundes
can make him but immortall:
Who feares
God, feares not death:
and who feares it not,
feares not the worst of
this life.
            By this reckening,
you will tell me, death
is a thing to bee wished
for: and to passe from
so much euil, to so much
good, a man should (it
seemeth) cast away his
life. Surely, I feare not,
that for any good wee
expect, wee will hasten
one steppe the faster:
though the spirit aspire,

the body (it drawes with
it) withdrawes it euer
sufficiently towards the
earth. Yet is it not
that I conclude. Wee
must seeke to mortifie
our flesh in vs, and to
cast the World out of
vs: but to caste our
selues out of the world
is in no sort permitted
vs. The Christian ought
willingly to depart out
of this life, but not cowardly
to runne away.
The Christian is ordained
by GOD to fight
therein: and cannot
leaue his place without
incurring reproach and

infamie. But if it please
the graund Captaine to
recall him, let him take
the retrait in good part,
and with good will obey
it. For hee is not
borne for himselfe, but
for God: of whom hee
holdes his life at farme,
as his tenant at will, to
yeelde him the profites.
It is in the Land-lord to
take it from him, not
in him to surrender it,
when a conceite takes
him. Diest thou young?
prayse God, as the Mariner▪
that hath had a
good winde, soone to
bring him to the Port.

Dyest thou Olde?
prayse him likewise: for
if thou hast had lesse
winde, it may be thou
hast also had lesse waues.
But thinke not at thy
pleasure to go faster or
softer: for the winde is
not in thy power; and
in steade of taking the
shortest way to the Hauen,
thou maiest happely
suffer shipwracke.
God calleth home frō
his worke, one in the
morning, another at
noone, and another at
night. One hee exerciseth
till the first sweat,
another hee sunne-burneth,

another hee roasteth
& drieth throughly.
But of all his hee
leaues all to rest, and
giues them al their hire,
euerie one in his time.
Who leaues his worke
before God call him,
loseth it: and who
importunes him before
the time, loseth
his reward. Wee must
rest vs in his wil, who in
the middest of our troubles
sets vs at rest.
            To ende, wee ought
neither to hate this life
for the toyles therein;
for it is slouth and cowardise:
nor loue it for

the delights; which is
folly and vanitie: but
serue vs of it, to serue
God in it, who after it
shal place vs in true quietnesse,
and replenish
vs with pleasures which
shal neuer more perish.
Neither ought wee to
flie death; for it is childish
to feare it: and
in flying from it, wee
meete it. Much lesse to
seeke it, for that is temeritie:
nor euerie one
that would die, can die.
As much despaire in
the one, as cowardise in
the other: in neither any
kinde of magnanimitie.

It is enough that we
constantly and continually
waite for her comming,
that she may neiuer
finde vs vnprouided.
For as there is nothing
more certaine then
death, so is ther nothing
more vncertain then the
houre of death, knowne
onely, o God, the onely
Author of life & death,
to whom wee all ought
endeuour both to liue &
die.
            
               Dye to liue:
Liue to Dye.
