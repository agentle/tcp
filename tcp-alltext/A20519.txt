               THere is nothing more delightfull than mirthfull recreation, which I doubt not but whoſoeuer ſhall peruſe this ſmall Treatiſe, will be ſufficientlie ſatisfied: It is like vnto a Garden wherein each humour may haue his ſeuerall walke priuate and vntrequented (as yet) of any Paſſengers. It is no forraine tranſlation, but a homebred ſubiect, nor dooth hee deſire anie other thing than his patrimony, which is, as being the eldeſt ſonne of Skoggin, to be eſteemed for no Changeling, onely by how much the propertie of his father was fitte to be altred, hee hath by ſo much, in the quantitie of his time reformed: he is to auntient men mirth, to the middle age profite, and to youth nurture, pregnant witte: To conclude, hee is George Dobſon, whoſe pleaſant meriments

are worthy to be regiſtred among the famous Recordes of the ieaſting Worthies: yea▪ hee hath proceeded farther in degree than Garagantua, Howleglaſſe, Tiell, Skoggin, olde Hobſon, or Cocle: Hee hath put himſelfe to the publique view of all men, and deſireth to beare you company to your priuate Studies, where when your leaſure doth permit you, his preſence may delight you. And ſo I bid you heartily farewell.

               ¶ How ſir Thomas Pentley adopted George Dobſon for his ſonne. Chap. 1.
               
                  IN the Cittie of Durham was ſometime reſident, one ſir Thomas Pentley, a Prieſt, inſtituted after the olde order vſed in Quéene Maries dayes, who for his exquiſite ſkil in muſicke, was admitted to be a Canoniſt in the Cathedrall church of Durham: and for he was alſo otherwiſe ſuppoſed learned, and a man of modeſt life, he was beneficed beſides with the vicarage of Saint Giles in the ſame towne: by reaſon whereof he waxed very rich, and a great pennie father, liuing alwayes vnmarried, and kéeping no houſhold or retinue about him, ſaue onely one of his ſiſters, whoſe huſband dying, he tooke home to be his huſwife: after that there was a diſſolution made of their Cloyſter, and that it was thought fit for men, rather to liue at their owne choice, than at others appoyntment, graunting all that would, liberty to take wiues, and they whoſe ſtomacke ſtoode againſt that eſtate of matrimony, to diſpoſe

of themſelues as to them ſéemed good and moſt correſpondent to their liking. This ſir Thomas, in time, ſéeing his money to increaſe, and his wealth to abound, reſolued with himſelfe, ſince hée was determined neuer to take wife, whereby to haue children, vnto whome he might leaue this his aboundaunce and riches (I ſay) reſolued with himſelfe, to diſpoſe of it in ſome good ſort during his life time, leſt otherwiſe his friends, after his death, ſhould goe together by the eares in diuiding the ſtake. Therefore he beganne, by little and little, to play the good fellow, cauſing his ſiſter, who was both Cooke and Cater, to prouide him good and plenteous fare, inuiting alſo his neighbours and others his acquaintances to dine and to ſuppe with him: eſpecially vppon ſolempne feaſtes, as Chriſtmaſſe, and Eaſter, he kept open houſe, and gaue good and bounteous entertainement vnto all that would come. And ſo prodigally hée ſpent, as in the end his huſwife beganne to repine at his large hoſpitality, perſwading her ſelfe, that if he continued this courſe long, it would be but a very little that would fall in diuidence to his friendes after his death, and therefore ſhée thought euery way as good to take part with him, as to exſpect that which the cat leaueth in the mault. Whereupon ſhe ſent to her other ſiſter dwelling in the country, who was maried to one Ieffrey Dobſon, certifying her of their brothers vnthriftineſſe, withall, admoniſhing her to make a ſpéedy repaire vnto the cittie, and with her to bring her huſband, children, and family to make their abode, dwelling, and ſtay with ſir Thomas: For otherwiſe, if ſhée omitted that opportunitie, it was a very probable matter, that her ſhare of his goods would be very ſlender, and farre ſhort of her exſpectation, for our brother, ſaieth ſhe, is fallen into ſuch an humour of ſpending, that his yéerely reuenewes will ſcarcely diſchardge his yéerely expence.

Hir ſiſter at this newes became as pale as aſhes, and ſore ſhe feared that all would be gone before ſhe could get her family remooued to the towne. And as though ſir Thomas had béene already dead, and the executors gone away with all the goodes, ſhée ranne to the fields, where her huſband was at the plow, to make knowne vnto him what meſſage her ſiſter had ſent her. The good man who had taken her to wife, more in regarde of that benefit hée hoped to reape by her after ſir Thomas his death, than any other reſpect, made no leſſe haſte to be remoouing, than ſhe deſired: and ſo foorthwith looſing his oxen foorth of their teame, commaunding his men to goe home and threſh foorth all his corne preſently, and his wife to packe vp all her houſhold ſtuffe and napery againſt the next morning, himſelfe went forth preſently to a neighbours houſe néere by, and let to him the leaſe of his farme: and comming home that night, his wife hauing diſpatched euery thing according to his commandement, he conueyed his ſtuffe, ſo much as he thought néedefull, to the citie of Durham next morning, carrying with him his wife and children, whome he brought with him to the vicarage of S. Giles, at the very inſtant when ſir Thomas was ſet to dinner, but newly come home from the Minſter, where (according to his cuſtome, hée had béene helping to ſing diuine Seruice. Whiles ſir Thomas was eagerly caruing ſuch meates as were ſet vpon the table, his appetite being very ſharpe, he ſodainely heard a great ruſhing and noyſe of cartes, rattling vpon the ſtones within the court, and maruelling whence ſuch noyſe ſhould come, if it were not there, and what occaſion any had to be there, he could not coniecture, ſith himſelfe had no vſe for any at all, neither did he know of any that had buſineſſe there to doe, more than halfe miſdoubting his hearing, he ſtarted foorthwith from the table, and looking foorth at his windowe, he did

beholde his court full of cartes, loaden with tables, cupbords, beddes, and ſuch like houſholde ſtuffe, at which ſight he was not alittle amazed, fearing that the Biſhop had endowed ſome other with the benefice of that vicarige, meaning to depriue him, and that the cartes and ſtuffe appeared to be the new parſons: yet he no leſſe maruelled why the Biſhop ſhould ſo do, conſidering that hée no way ill deſerued, either committed any thing whereby to incurre the Biſhops diſpleaſure. Alſo, if this his ſuppoſall were true, hée thought it ſtrange and vncharitable dealing, that hée ſhould in ſuch maner be excluded, without either admoniſhment or notice giuen to prouide for himſelfe. But preſently, as he ſtoode there diuerſly diſtracted, with theſe doubtfull thoughts, he was aduertized by his houſkéeper, who had inquired the matter of the Carters, that the ſtuffe was his ſiſter Dobſons, who with her huſband and children ſhe ſayd, was come to make her remaine and dwelling there with him, and who, as ſhée was making this report, came in at the gate, her huſband and children with her. But ſir Thomas not alitle eſtranging at the newes, backened to the Carremen to ſtay the vnloading of their cartes, till he came foorth to méete his ſiſter at the doores, of whome demanding the cauſe of her comming after ſuch a ſort, hée was informed of his houſe kéepers embaſſage ſent to her, wherewith he was verie much offended, cauſing them all to come into the houſe and dine: with good and faire ſpéeches hée intreated her to returne to her owne home againe, with aſſured promiſe that hée would prouide ſufficiently for her, and the reſidue of his friendes: and for the better ſecurity thereof, becauſe that imprudently they had leaſed away their Farme, hée preſently gaue to her huſband the moytie of a tithe he held amounting to tenne poundes a yéere, vntil ſuch time as their owne Farme ſhould fall vnto them againe:

and alſo hée tooke from them their eldeſt ſonne, George Dobſon, whome hée adopted for his owne, and brought vppe at Schoole in Durham, to whoſe courſe of life and merry ieaſts, wée will direct the tract enſuing, licencing his mother well contented with her brothers beneuolence, to returne to the countrey againe with her huſband, and other children.
            
            
               
                  NOw is George Dobſon taken from his mothers lappe, and left to the care and prouidence of his vnckle ſir Thomas, who perceiuing his diſpoſition knauiſh, thought good in time to hoope him in before hée fell to licking: and knowing, that while the twigge is yong and tender, it is alſo flexible, to kéepe him from other waggiſh turns, hée iudged it the beſt courſe to ſet him to the Schooles: and in regarde himſelfe vſed to goe twice euery day vnto the Minſter, hée could not ſo well attend him, as his wildneſſe required: and fearing againe, that his fooliſh loue towardes him might induce him to forbeare correction when hée well deſerued the ſame, and the neglect thereof was a certaine meane for euer to vndoe him, hée rather determined to ſend him to the Church of Saint Nicholas amongſt other little children of the Cittie, where

hée had not béene thrée dayes, but hée falling at variance with a Merchants ſonne of the ſame towne that was his ſchoole fellow, he burſt his lanthorne booke all to péeces, and the boyes forehead was ſo ſore, that the blood ranne about his eares, neyther could they ſtay it, but conducted him home to his mother, who when ſhee ſawe the blood of her little ſonne, ſhée well-néere fell into a ſowne, and had ſuncke to the earth, if ſhée had not béene ſupported by her huſband, who after hee had well viewed it, aſſured her that the boy was nothing the worſe, and then ſending for a Surgeon, cauſed him to ſtay the bléeding, and to plaiſter the ſore: but albeit there was hope of amendment, yet when the mother knew after what manner it was done, ſhée bitterly raged againſt poore Dobſon, cauſing, not onely his Schoole maiſter ſeuerely to correct him, but attending ſir Thomas his comming from the Cathedrall Church, who was to paſſe by her ſhoppe, ſhée made a grieuous complaint to him againſt his Nephew, bringing her ſonne to the view, and ſhewed him the greatneſſe of the ſore, and after a womans manner, whoſe anger is implacable, and whoſe reuenge is meaſureleſſe, ſhe tolde ſir Thomas, that vnleſſe he did puniſh his nephew for the fact, ſhee would haue him debarred of comming any more to ſchoole there, either the maiſter, if he receiued him, ſhe would haue extruded from his place. Sir Thomas in good ſpéeches praying her to be ſatiſfied, promiſed to performe her deſire, and if ſhée miſtruſted his word, if ſo it ſéemed good to her, hée offered to giue him the lawe in her preſence. But ſhe told him, no, that he ſhould not, for ſhe nothing doubted the fulfilling of his promiſe, and that ſhée did not ſeeke his affliction by way of reuenge, but that he might thereby be warned and deterred from doing ſo any more, and ſo ſéemed to requeſt him to doe it diſcreetely and without bitterneſſe:

ſir Thomas made few more replies, but made haſte home to welcome his new gueſt with the whippe: and though he were ſory for the childes hurt, yet hée could not but laugh in his minde, at the knauery of his Nephew, and the chollericke ſtomacke of the Merchants wife, poore Dobſon nothing at all thinking of further conflictes, lamenting onely the breaking of his booke, for which hée not a little ſorrowed what anſwere to make to his vncle: to lie, he eſtéemed it the worſt courſe that could be, for hée knew his vnckle would ſift foorth the trueth, and if hée ſhould be taken with a falſe report, he was aſſured to be purged thereof with no leſſe than with the beſt bloud in his breath: ſo, not able to bethinke himſelfe of a reaſonable excuſe, hée wept no leſſe than for his beating receiued at his Maiſters handes, exſpecting a ſharper penaunce. His maiſter obſeruing him ſtill to continue in teares, demanded of him why he further wept, to whom he bewrayed his feares, and the cauſe thereof. His Maiſter mooued to compaſſionate his caſe, and déeming it iniuſtice to haue him two times puniſhed for one offence, he ſent for alittle glew, repayred his booke, and writ to his vnckle all the circumſtaunces of what had happened, defiring him to remit vnto him this firſt little delict, and to content himſelfe with ſuch puniſhment as he already had inflicted vpon him. Dobſon humbly thanking his Maiſter for this vnlooked for benignitie, as blithe as Bird onM
                        〈…〉
                     
                   briar, poſteth home with his warrant in his pocket, but hée was no ſooner entred into the Hall, and had broken a curteſie to his vnckle while he did eſpie vppon the Table hollie wandes in water, colde cates, God wote, to ſtay his emptie ſtomacke withall. His vnckle taking one of them into his hand, ſayde: Now good ſir, where haue you beſtowed your ſelfe this day, that you ſtay ſo late abroade? Good vnckle, replied Dobſon with a ſober and

demure countenaunce, caſting his eyes vpon the ground, I haue béene at the Schoole. Haue you ſo? ſayeth ſir Thomas▪
                   I pray then lets ſée your booke, and how much you haue learned all this day? With that poore Dobſon breathed foorth a pitteous ſigh, and with a penſiue heart and trembling hands hée pulled his patched booke foorth of his pocket, at which ſight his vnckle not able to containe himſelfe from ſmiling, turning away that hée might not be perceiued, laughed a good ſpace: afterward reflecting his lookes vpon his lamentable nephew, downe whoſe chéekes the teares ſtreamed. My boy, ſayde hée, I pray thée, who hath made thée a Joyner? mée thinkes thou haſt taken thy booke in ſunder, and haſt made it to ſtand vppon ioynts, whereas in the morning it appeared vnto mée to be all one péece▪ without chincke, ioynt, or member, otherwiſe my ſight deceiued me: then Dobſon proſtrating himſelfe, humbly prayed his vnckle of pardon, and made true relation of the conflict paſſed betwixt him and his fellow, and that whatſoeuer he had doone, it was in his owne defence, adding moreouer, that his Maiſter had already giuen him due puniſhment for his treſpaſſe, and therewithall hée pulled foorth his Maiſters note, and deliuered it to his vnckle, the ſubiect whereof agréed wholly with his reporte, and had vndoubtedly procured his pardon, if hée had not remembred his promiſe before made to the Merchaunts wife, whereupon hée cauſed poore Dobſon to vntruſſe, and to offer his bréech to the blocke, which hée ſoundly laſhed, and the next morrow carrying him vnto the Merchants wife, cauſed him to aſke both her and her ſonne forgiueneſſe, who pardoning him, hée was ſent agayne to the Schoole, with charge to kéepe the peace with his fellows, leſt he drunke of the whippe againe.
            
            
               
               ¶ How the Boyes of the Schoole cauſed George Dobſon to be whipped for their fault. Chap. III.
               
                  THus is George Dobſon (as you haue heard) ſent againe to the Schoole, where hée had not long continued but that hée precéeded the moſt part of his fellowes, who long before him had béene ſent thither, to his vnckles great content and pleaſure, who at all times warned him to beware of playing the wagge, and of quarrelling with his fellowes, threatning him, that if hée ſo ill carried himſelfe, hée would for euer eiect and turne him out of the doores, whereas otherwiſe, if as a duetifull boy he would apply his books, and would alſo conforme himſelfe to the diſpoſition of his fellowes, and with them would liue in vnitie and concord, hée ſhould not then want any manner of thing conuenient to his eſtate and calling, but that after his death hée would make him his ſole heire, and poſſeſſe him of all his landes, leaſes, farmes, and hereditaments. The boy was very attentiue to his vnckles exhortations, and conceiued well, that ſuch aduiſe and counſell much concerned his health and welfare, and therefore (to his power) hée put them in execution, behauing and demeaning himſelfe very reſpectiuely, both in the preſence of his vnckle, and abroad:

euer ſtanding in doubt, that if hée ſhould committe any thing vnapproouable, that the ſame might come to his vnckles knowledge, and if ſo, he were then for euer vndone. But notwithſtanding all his care, which was méere acquiſi
                     •
                  e and not habituall, as affirmeth the olde Prouerb, That which is bred in the bone, will not foorth of the fleſh:
Naturam expellas furca licet vſque recurret.
               
               Hée muſt néedes goe whome the diuell driueth: and whoſe fortune it is to be ſtrangled, certaine it is hée ſhall neuer drowne: So albeit George Dobſon ſtudied by all poſſible meanes to performe all his vnckles pleaſures and commaundements, yet for his life hée could not accompliſh them, ſo many blockes were ſet for him to ſtumble vpon, for naturally he was of a crabbed and vntoward diſpoſition, and ſo ruſtike like, that he could not couer his clowniſh and wayward manners with the habite of ciuility, and in regard of his rude and ill fauoured geſtures, antique trickes, and apiſh toyes, his Schoolefellowes many times tooke occaſion to deride, ſcorne, and laugh at him: whereof hée being very impatient, and not daring with clubbe and fiſt to reuenge it, leſt thereby hée ſhould procure his vnckles indignation, for exceſſiue griefe, anger and ſorrow, he would wrinckle his browes, whet his téeth, and pull the haires from his head, which hée would ſcatter and throw abroad in franticke manner. And if it had not béene more for the feare hée had to looſe his vnckles fauour, than the whipping hee aſſured himſelfe would enſue the combate, the moſt part of them had felt the weight of his fiſts. But the reſpect of his vnckles loue and affection mooued him to beare ſo long, vntill his heart was like to breake with diſcontent. The boyes of the Citty playing vppon this aduantage, eſpecially his Schoolefellowes, knowing him to be bred in the Countrey,

banded themſelues together, made no leſſe to doe about him, than the other birds doe of the Owle at noonetime, if they catch her abroade in the wooddes; they omitted no opportunitie to diſgrace him, eyther by riming, or railing vpon him, and with euery other deſpite their waggiſh braines could deuiſe, they abuſed him: many times they would forge matters of diſorder, thereby to incenſe their maiſter againſt him, yea and moſt times when themſelues had committed the faultes woorthy of correction, they would thruſt the blame vppon him. And although hée had euer wit enough to diſcharge and cléere himſelfe of their accuſations, by the inference of diuerſe probabilities of the contrary: yet, becauſe they were a multitude, and hée onely one, their teſtimony was allowed, and hée aſſuredly ſuſtained the puniſhment, becauſe the fact doone, and their witneſſe improoued him, hée not being able in particular to conuict any of them of the offence. And in the winter éeuenings they enacted many a lewd ſtratageme about the ſhoppes in their way to the Schoole, as burſting glaſen wind
                     •
                  wes, ouerthrowing Milke maides pailes, pulling downe ſtalles, and cruſhing out the linckes which were hung foorth to giue light to the Paſſengers in the ſtreetes. And whenſoeuer they were purſued by any of the perſons houſe or family to whome theſe iniuries were done, they hadde decréed that ſome ſhould betake themſelues to flight, as acceſſary and guilty of the treſpaſſe, and that ſome others ſhoulde abide, as nothing conſenting to the act, and willingly ſhould reueale and nominate the parties offending, which whoſoeuer they were, onely Dobſon was the man ſtandered, though both innocent and ignorant, yet euer vpon the next morrowe, the lawe procéeded, the caſe was determined againſt him, and he was found guilty by the generall verdict of the Jury. And to conclude, hee vppon

euery ſuch occaſion ſuffered alwayes the puniſhment that others had deſerued: and theſe centriuings of his felows were ſo continuall, that they made him almoſt wearie of his life, and ſo deſperate in the end, that he became in reſpect thereof, that he reſolued rather than any further to tollerate this miſ-vſage, either to runne his countrey, or to forſake his friendes and their company, eyther to ſet at naught his vnckles iniunctions, and as he coulde catch any of them alone, whoſe malice hée perceiued to be endleſſe againſt him, to pay them their debts in a diuels name. Long hée reſted doubtfull whether courſe to make choice of, and after much diſcuſſe and conſideration, he conceiued, that to relinquiſh his vnckle and other his friendes in ſuch a ſort, were not his beſt booty, for one way hée ſhould thereby depriue himſelfe of all theyr kinde effection, and doe more domage and diſgrace to them all, and his owne good name, than all their miſchéeuous deuiſes could be able to effect. Becauſe the rumor of his departure, ſpreading it ſelfe through all parts of the Towne, would make the people ſuſped him acceſſary of ſome notorious treſpaſſe done againſt his vnckle, and for feare of puniſhment ſo to haue exiled himſelfe: either that his vnckle might be a ſhrewd and curious man, for ſtrictly handling him, and that to auoyde his auſterity and hard vſage, hée had thus put himſelfe to flight, eyther of which conceits hée collected might be preiudiciall to them both. Againe, whither to runne or direct his courſe, he knew not, vnleſſe it were home to his mother, who he was perſwaded would returne him backe with a very vengeaunce. And then (ſaide hée) with what face can I looke vpon my vnckle, or any other perſon of my acquaintance? And to goe to any other place, alas who will entertaine or receiue me, euery ſtraunger will ſuppoſe the trueth, that I am runne from my friendes, and

that therefore I am the more apt to doe the ſame from them, If I ſhall taſte any aſperitie or eagre vſage, this wil be their imagination of me, and heereuppon euery man wil be afraide to admit me into his houſe, and what then will enſue of me? If not, either to ſtarue, begge, or ſteale: ſo that this courſe, vpon theſe conſiderations, hée reiected, as in no caſe to be proſecuted. And for the other, to fall to fiſty cuffes, to giue them as good as they broght, and to pay them home their loane, with vſurie, though his ſtomacke ſerued well thereto, and his deſire to deale his almes amongſt them in ſuch a ſort, was no leſſe than to his dinner, yet he apprehended diuers inconueniences imminent thereupon to enſue, to wit, his Maiſters rewarde, which could be no leſſe worth than twenty laſhes, at euery time hée ſhould hazard for it, and the enmity of his fellowes, and the worſt that they could doe vnto him beſides he was to exſpect. But both theſe two were in his cut already, and as a man would ſay, predeſtinate vnto him before either coate or ſhert. And therefore ſéeing it was his deſtiny, and a thing ineuitable, it was as good to haue ſome play for his money, he thought, as to giue it away gratis. But then to curbe this reſolution came to his remembraunce, the loſſe of his vncles goodwill and affection, if he ſhould ſo violate his commaundement, and doe againſt his owne promiſe: nay, at his vnckles handes hée looked for no better than either vtter eiection, or the ſeuereſt puniſhment he could inflict. What ſhall then poore Dobſon determine to doe in the middeſt of ſo many extreames, neuer a one whereof hath any medium? Alas poore ſoule ſaith he to himſelfe, and is there no remedy, but either like a patient Aſſe I muſt applie my backe to ſupport all the burdens of my contumelious fellowes ſcornes, deriſions, abuſings, and forgeries, together with my maiſters mercileſſe and vniuſt puniſhments,

and the peoples vndeſerued exclamations, or elſe néedes muſt I take me to my héeles, and▪ ſo runne away, making my féete woorth twoo paire of handes, and my ſelfe guilty of ſome filthy crime, neuer ſo much as once thought vppon by me: or ſhall I ſtand vnto the matter, and turne againe like a man, and purchaſe my libertie, although with the expence of the deareſt blood in my breath, and perhappes with the loſſe of my vncles fauour, who if hée weigh well my cauſe, or could vnderſtand how I am forced thercunto, and that my reuenge is but equall and iuſt, hath no reaſon to be offended with me for ſuch action. And certainely, of all other it is my moſt honourable decrée, neyther is hee ſo auſtere, ſterne, or ſcarce of good nature, but that reaſon will perſwade him, and for once I will attempt him: The other courſes are not onely euilles, but ignominious, and where all are inconueniences, it is well allowed, that I make choice of the leaſt in apparance: and heerewith hée ſettled his purpoſe, that the next time they occaſioned him by any of their accuſtomd practiſes, or ſet any new ſnare wherein to catch him, he would hazard to hang ſome of them by the necke, if he could.
               Long it was not before they thus conſulted againſt him: in the Citty neare vnto the gate called Chappell Barre, was dwelling a Haverdaſher, who had a very faire wife, and as it was alſo reported, a merry diſpoſed wench, a good companion among Gallants, when ſhe could procure her huſbands abſence, eyther get a goſſiping. All the crew of Venus attendants hearing tell of her beauty, witle, and good fellowſhip, repayred to hir company, ſupplicating for Loues trophées, and the ſpoyle of her honeſty, whereof (as the rumour went) ſhee was no great niggard, yet amongſt all the number,

ſhée moſt affected a Butcher of the Citty, and her next neighbour, who the more to content her humour, continued in a Batchellors eſtate, though a man, of perſonage very proper, and much deſired of a multitude of Maides in the cittie, who ſpared not (ſo farre as modeſty permitted) to ſollicite his loue. But hée reſerued their exſpectations, therewithall to applaude the contents of this gallant Dame, and ſhe (as it was generally coniectured) vſed him with no leſſe kindeneſſe than her huſband, affoording to him all his deſires as opportunities ſerued her therevnto: and ſo often as her huſband had occaſions to abſent himſelfe, by reaſon of his going to Faires and Markets and other like neceſſarie buſineſſe in the Countrey, ſhée would giue intelligence thereof to the Butcher, who neuer failed to ſupply her defect in euery poynt, as if he had beene the Haberdaſher: Their familiarity and acquaintance, at the length, grew ſo publike, that euery corner of the Citty was ſilled with the report thereof, and moſt men eſteemed the Haberdaſher frée merchant in Cuckolds rowe: But ſhée ſtanding vpon the Pantophles of her honeſty, thought ſcorne to be tolde that Buckes had hornes, or that Tauernes were taken open Innes, and therefore, ſo often as ſhe was trodden vppon the toes, as diuers times in quarrels with her neighbours ſhe was let to vnderſtand how the verdite paſſed as concerning her honeſty, ſhee would forſooth perſwade her huſband that it was a ſufficient action to call ſuch perſons before the Chancellor of the Spiritualties, and eyther in the publique Court to prooue what they had ſlaundered her withall, or they failing therein, ſhoulde foorthwith bee conſtrayned to make her lawfull ſatiſfaction for ſo iniurious coſtes and charges.
               
                  And this ſhe continually ſuggeſted her huſband vnto, not vppon the knowledge of her innocency, but onely of purpoſe to cloude the poore cuckoldes eye-fight, and that vnder this pretext and chalenge, ſhe might inſinuate her ſelfe into her huſbands good conceit, and the better cloake her knaueries: and by theſe glorious ſhewes and painted deuiſes, ſhe ſo much preuailed with him, that he really beléeuing that ſhe was a mirror of true modeſty, and enuied onely by her neighbours, becauſe ſhe excéeded them in beauty, whereby he thought ſome iealouſies they had leſt ſhe might allure from them their deuoted ſerui
                     •
                  ours and affected friends, he walked on forward like a ſnaile with a houſe on her head, who no ſooner looketh forth, but her hornes are eſpyed, the poore foole therefore relying more confidence in his wifes flatteries, who notwithſtanding all her brauadoes, would haue béene very loth that matters ſhould haue come to the ſcanning: then his neighbours certaine and aſſured coniectures ſuppoſing his wife to be one of thoſe innocent ſoules, who were inturiouſly ſlaundered and perſecuted for her conſcience ſake, cauſed two honeſt matrons of the citty, the one a Draper, the other an Apothecaries wife, to be ſommoned before ſhe Commiſſary, and there, either to make good ſuch ſcandalous and opprobrious ſpéeches, as lately in their fallings out they had taxed her with all: not being able to manifeſt the ſame, he deſired the Commiſſary that they might be inioyned to aſke his wife forgiuenes, in the Court, Church, and market, in part of ſatiſfaction for her credite and good name, ſo depraued and brought in queſtion. But alas poore man, he had forgot that the more the durt is ſtirred, the greater ſtinch it yéeldes, and that whereas before he was but ſuſpected to be a cuckold, that now, if it were in their power to prooue it certaine, they would rather doe it, than hazard the penalty of the

lawe: But he, I ſay, nothing miſtruſting his wifes defence was very earneſt in the maſter, and ſo hotly preſſed them, as they could not auoyde him without their owne preiudice, vntill they made apparant by ſuch inſtances, as his wife was not able to improoue, and themſelues bluſhed to produce, that he was one of them to whome the bird in Maie ſings the double note, cuckoo. So when the caſe was ſubſtantially diſcuſſed, and ſentence to be giuen, the two matrons were diſcharged frée, and he confirmed a cuckold by the order of the Court.
               Héereupon ſuch poeticall braines as were reſident in the Citty, to whome intelligence was giuen of the circumſtances, rymed vpon the Haberdaſhers fortune, and his wifes behauiour, the Schoole-boyes ſung ballads thereof in euery ſtréete, and for nine dayes there was no talke in requeſt, but to diſcourſe how the Haberdaſher was knighted. The waggiſh mates who were Dobſons fellow ſchollers ſet their heades together, deuiſing how they might procure him the blocke, which they did thinke might eaſily be effected, if they could contriue any pageant, whereby to bewray the Haberdaſhers diſgrace, and impoſe it vpon him: for their maiſter was ſo much his friend, that he would not ſpare any of them to ſatiſfie him for any offence by them committed to his diſhonour, and ſo at laſt they concluded, ſome night, when the ſtréetes were at quiet, and none to diſturbe them, they would faſten to the appendix ouer the Haberdaſhers doore a paire of bulls hornes, with a pageant betwixt them, wherein they cauſed to be painted a man in his ſhoppe ſelling hattes, and a Butcher in a parlour with his wife, his one arme folding and embrating her about the middle, and in his other hand he held a maſtiffe dog in a ſtring. Ouer their heads was hanging the ſimilitude of a bird ſinging vpon a howthorne, and on his creſt hée

had curiouſly portrayed a redde and gréene bunch of feathers like a combe, foorth of the which ſprowted a fayre paire of ſéemely hornes, of a branded colour. This they got ſet on by the helpe of a Smith of their acquaintance, and who bare ſome tooth againſt the poore Haberdaſher, that ſo bolſtered the head of his hammer, that it forced in the naile, without any noyſe making: And vnderneath th
                     •
                   pageant they placed theſe few lines written in parchment as followeth, ſubſcribing George Dobſons name thereunto.
               
                  
                     
                        Who hattes is heere diſpoſde to buy,
                        Theſe hornes to him ſuch happe eſcry,
                        That heere no hattes are to be ſolde,
                        Vnleſſe it be for ſome cuckolde.
                     
                     
                        Such is the maiſter of this ſhoppe,
                        Such ſhall they be that with him choppe
                        Or change an olde hatte for a new,
                        His bargaine he may happly rew.
                     
                     
                        When on his browes are to be ſeene,
                        Such hornes as theſe and them betweene:
                        Theſe glorious enſignes of a knight,
                        Who periſht his weapons in a fight,
                     
                     
                        Which he commenſt againſt his wife,
                        With whom he had a doubtfull ſtrife:
                        But ſhe got victory on the morne,
                        And reard theſe trophees vp in ſcorne,
                     
                     
                        His feeble fight for to bewray,
                        Who playd the coward, and ranne away:
                        If he deny this to be true,
                        The Chancery Rolles can to you ſhew.
                     
                     
                        That he adiudged is to be,
                        A cuckold of the beſt degree:
                        And we as Heraults him aſſigne
                        
                           Theſe armes, for now, and after time.
                     
                     
                        Thus is he bounden to his frends,
                        That to him ſuch great fauour lends:
                        But you (good cuckold) take your ſleepe,
                        The Butchers dog your doore doth keepe:
                        And when you ride to Hexam faire,
                        The maiſter will himſelfe be there.
                     
                     
                        And thus wiſhing all health to your hornes,
I bid you good morrow,
George Dobſon.
                     
                  
               
               When theſe braue wagges had perfourmed all theſe their deuiſes, for that inſtant they went euery man his way home to bed; on the next morrow, it being ſunday, the Haberdaſher and his family kept their beddes longer than on the wéeke dayes they had béene accuſtomed, not hauing any greater buſineſſe to goe about before feruice time, than onely to make their maiſters apparrell ready, and wearied with ouer-labouring themſelues the wéeke precedent, they ſlept it out till halfe houre paſt ſeauen, all which time the doores being ſhutt, the ſigne of the horne gaue a glorious ſhew to the paſſengers that came by, whereof there was good ſtore that morning, for it was at that inſtant the wéeke wherein the Aſſiſes were holden at Dunholme, and the Towne (in regard thereof) was full of ſtrangers: no man paſſed by but hée ſurueighed the ignominy of the poore Haberdaſher, reading the verſes vnderſet ſo many as could, others that had no ſkill in letters, got them peruſed by ſuch as could, and as they vnderſtoode the contents, euery man bleſſed his forehead from the Haberdaſher and his hattes, laughing apace, and making good ſporte at the conceit of the ieaſt. After a while, the laſt come of his apprentices, whoſe cuſtome was to be firſt vp, and to make the fires,

hearing ſuch noiſe and concourſe of people about the ſhop, came haſtily ruſhing to the doores, and vnbolting the ſame, ſet them open, to ſée what the ſtirre might be: but as the doores fell open, hée might eaſily perceiue the cauſe of ſuch aſſembling of the people, and as one diſtracted with this ſodaine aſpect, he ſtoode amongſt them as one who at the ſight of Gorgons head had thereby béene tranſformed into a pillar of ſtone: the people laughed a good deale the more at his aſtoniſhment, whereby the poore boyes amazement and ſhame increaſed: but recollecting his ſpirits, he paced vp the ſtaires to his maiſters chamber, where he was in bed with his honeſt miſtris, by whoſe carefull indeuour hée was promoted to the order of the forked knights, whoſe ſcutchion and coate armour is the bugle horne. The Haberdaſher nothing leſſe exſpecting, was by his apprentice informed of all what was to be ſéene: at the relation whereof he leaped foorth of his bed, reaching to his ſword, which hung beſides him in the chamber, and caſting onely his gowne about him, without any other clothes, hée ranne downe the ſtaires, as a man newly bereft of his wittes, and infurious and moſt terrible manner aſſaulting the hornes, hée all to batterd and cut them from the doores, and tearing off the ſcrowle, he rent it into péeces: at which ſpectacle the people were ready to die with laughing. But the Haberdaſher hauing got the field, and giuen his enemies the ouerthrow, not ſo much as bidding his neighbours good morrow, he returned againe into his houſe, ſo afflicted with ſhame and griefe, as all that day he coulde not acquiet himſelfe, but fared vp and downe like a bedlam, exclaiming againſt his wife, and accurſing the time wherein he came firſt acquainted with her, thus (by her lewd and naughty carriage) to become the ſcorne of the worlde: but ſhée with gentle and calme ſpéeches

ſought to temper his paſſions, praying him to pardon what was paſt, and ſhee would vow and promiſe for euer héereafter, to liue ſo ſoberly and ſo modeſtly, as hée ſhould thinke himſelfe ſufficiently ſatiſfied for hir former miſdemeanour: and further alſo ſhe perſwaded him not to permitte ſo ſhamefull a diſgrace to paſſe vnreuenged, and therefore ſhée mooued him to charge ſir Thomas with the ſame before the Deane and Chapiter of the houſe, aſſuring him, that they would enforce him vppon his conſcience to diſcloſe ſo much as hée knew thereof, for (ſayde ſhe) albeit the boy be very waggiſh, and apt enough to execute ſo much knauery as he can bethinke, yet do I not perſwade my ſelfe that he could inuent this, and hang it vp in ſuch a ſort, without the aſſiſtance of ſome more ſuttle braine than his owne, and therefore ſir Thomas being accuſed thereof before his maiſters, will eyther confeſſe the ſame vpon their iniunction and commaund, (if he haue béene a factor therein:) or otherwiſe, if he be ignorant, yet ſhall he be vrged (for his owne diſcharge) to conſtraine his nephue to vnfold the truth of the whole matter.
               The poore foole not conſidering that this courſe was ſtill a meane to publiſh and divulge his further infamie, followed his wiues aduice, and waited his time without acquainting ſir Thomas of his intent, he repaired to the Deane at ſuch time, when hee and the reſidue of the prebends were aſſemblsd in their Chapter-houſe, to confer of certaine leaſes to be demiſed, and the reformation of ſome diſorders in the Church-men: hée being admitted into the Chapter houſe, requeſted M. Deanes and their fauours, deſiring that ſir Thomas might bee called before them, that he might liberally diſburſſe his minde, and freely lay open his griefe withall, beſeeching them that according to their accuſtomed ſinceritie and pious conſiderations,

they would grant him iuſtice againſt ſir Thomas, ſo farre as the equitie of his cauſe might ſeem to require, which they promiſed to doe; and ſending for ſir Thomas, who immediatly preſented himſelfe, they willed the Habberdaſher to procéed with what hee had to ſay who amply related at large the ſetting vp of the hornes, with the ſcrowles annexed, and the ſhame hee ſuſtained thereby, and adding, he ſayd; ſir Thomas this was either properly your own act, or otherwiſe it was done by your direction, for vnto the ſcrole was ſubſcribed the name of your nephew, George Dobſon: and therefore good maſter Deane (ſaid he) let ſir Thomas be inioyned to ſhewe his purpoſe therein, and to make me amends, or I ſhall complaine vpon you all to higher powers, who I truſt wil remedie my caſe, and afford mee law and iuſtice againſt you all, for the neglect of my ſatiſfaction; for you ought to inſtruct ſuch ignorant people (as my ſelfe) not onely by good and wholeſome doctrine, but alſo by the example of a holy and godly life, and it hath not béen heard of in any mans age, that euer any ſuch abuſe hath béen deuiſed by any of the Clergie, as this which hath béene practized vpon me: and therefore I ſue to you M. Deane, and the reſt of your brother-hood, that I, as I am publikely diſgraced thereby, ſo at the next time of the Seſſions, ſir Thomas in the face of the Judges of Aſſiſes, and the people there aſſembled, ſhall confeſſe his miſdoing, and vpon his knées ſhall aſke me and my wife forgiueneſſe, for certainely, I am perſwaded, that albeit his Nephew ſéemeth to take it vnto him, yet can it be no other, then ſir Thomas his deuiſe: for which (I ſay) if you doe not conſtraine him in this forme to ſatiſfie mée, I ſhall ſpeake ſhame of you all, & aſſure my ſelfe that you haue beene all thereunto aſſenting as much as he, and herewith in a great chafe he was ready to depart, without

hearing of Sir Thomas his reply, either M. Deanes verdict, who laughed full heartily at the Habberdaſhers impatience, and his hot inuectiue made againſt ſir Thomas. But diſſembling it as much as poſſibly he could, couering his face with his gowne ſléeue, hée intreated the Habberdaſhers placable audience, till ſir Thomas had made anſwer to his obiection; wherein if he did not fully diſcharge and acquit himſelfe, he ſwore to him vpon his holineſſe, that both ſir Thomas, and his Nephew likewiſe ſhould vndergoe, either that, or any other penance: notwithſtanding (ſaid M. Deane) that I could wiſh, you would admit of ſome other ſatiſfaction more to your owne commoditie, and with more ſafe eſcape of your credit. For ſay that ſir Thomas ſhould performe all that you deſire, yet if therebe any cauſe of probabilitie, that your wife hath faulted to you, though but in ſuſpect amongſt your neighbours, yet this action miniſtring occaſion to ſtrangers to make inquirie of the matter amongſt their acquaintances in the towne, and ſhall therby vnderſtand their cenſures and opinions, it will but make the infamie the more notorious, that he doth it vpon Iniunction, and feare leſt that if he ſhould refuſe ſo to doe, he ſhould be depriued of his Benefices and diſgraded: others will coniecture, that he doth it the more to notifie your diſgrace, and your wifes ill demeanor, to the ende that ſhe perceiuing her ſhame to be publiſhed, may be forced to correct her carriage; for vnleſſe my memorie do faile me, I vnderſtand by the Chancelor of our ſpiritnallties, that too much hath béene proued againſt her. And if ſir Thomas then ſhould firſt acknowledge the ſetting vp of the ſaid hornes which ſtuffeth this your ſtomake, and it can digeſt no better courſe but reuenge, and after that he hath made the ſame acknowledgement, ſhall reply and inferre, that hée hath done no more then

hath béene prooued in open Court, to bée due to ſuch diſhoneſt dealings, and ſhall alſo adduce the ſame Teſtificants, that were witneſſes againſt her in the Chancery, where will then your amends be had, ſhall not then your matter be worſe then at the beginning?, yea certainely. But howſoeuer, I am very willing that you haue iuſtice, and whatſoeuer penaltie the law will impoſe for ſo indigne an action if he cannot cleare himſelfe hée ſhall abide it, but tis conuenientt we put him to his purgation, and heare what anſwere he can make, and turning his face toward ſir Thomas, he thus framed his ſpeach.
               I doe not a little meruaile, that you ſir Thomas, ſhould ſhew yourſelfe ſo ſcarce of reaſon, or ciuilitie; nay, ſo void of the feare of God and the reſpect of your function, and the good eſtimate of vs all, whoſe credites muſt needs be blemiſhed, if you haue had a hand heerein, or meddled in ſuch irreligious complots, to the vtter defamation of any perſon, with ſuch hazzard of ther liues and ſoules. For if on the ſhame therof they had laid violent hands on them ſelues, deſperately kild ech other, what a horrible ſin had you béene guiltie of and attaint? I grant it is your office, Vitia improbare, turpitudinem, redarguere, & fratrem peccantem admonere: but it is to be done Suauiter & ſine amaritudine, and with Noahs bleſſed ſonne we muſt rather take the mantle from our owne backs, to couer therewith our brothers nakedneſſe, then with wicked Cham, lay open our fathers ſhame to the view of the world; which if we doe, we are to expect no better reward then was his, to wit, the malediction of our heauenly and celeſtiall father, and therefore without inference of many circumſtances, if you be giltie I doe charge you vpon your conſcience, Prieſt-hood, and the dutie you owe vnto God and our fellowſhip, in a word ſincerely to confeſſe it, and if you be ignorant thereof or not aſſenting thereto,

your oath ſhall ſuffice to ſatiſfie both vs and this honeſt man; and therewith he cauſed a booke to be caryed to ſir Thomas, wherevppon he depoſed as followeth: By the contents of this holy Bible, by the loue I owe vnto Almightie God, and by my obedience vnto this place and ſocietie, vpon the integritie of my conſcience, and the honor of my Prieſt-hood: I am innocent of euery paticular wherewith this man chargeth me, and this is the firſt time that euer I heard of it. And alſo I proteſt, that if my Nephew haue beene an Agent herein, I ſhall firſt giue him ſuch puniſhment as he hath deſerued, and after I ſhall exclude and renounce him for euer: and therewith he kiſſed the booke, and ſurrendred it againe. Whereat good-man Gooſe was cleane quatted, and not able to bring any further proofe, departed a more knowne cuckolde than before, and ſo continued all his life long.
               Sir Thomas being alſo diſmiſſed from the Chapter houſe, could not be contented vntill he had further inquired of this matter, and ſo going to the ſchoole, he examined his nephew of the ſame, in the preſence of his maiſter, and the ſchollers, of whome there were diuerſe, which did euidence againſt him, both falſely, and vpon malice, eſpecially they who were the principall offendors, as a Tanner and Painters ſonnes, who faced him downe, that he beſpoke them to prouide him of the ſignes which were ſet vp, and which they (miſtruſting no ſuch matter) affoorded him. But hereunto he anſwered with an vndaunted courage, that they iniuriouſly belyed him, and alledged ſo many reaſons as his childiſh braine could propound to improoue their aſſertions, but no reaſon would excuſe him, their teſtimony was alowed, and he ſharpely beaten, which he not knowing how to auoyde, he tooke patiently for the time, yet he proteſted that he was not onlie

innocent, but ignorant of the matter, and reſolued, that ſéeing it was ſo, that it was all one with him, to be a thiefe, and to be but onely ſuſpected, he altered his purpoſe as Ployden did the Caſe, reuenged his owne iniuries, without reſpect of either his vncles pleaſures, or his maiſters puniſhments, and ſo that day in their going home to dinner, hée dealt his beneuolence, and payed ſo ſoundly his falſe witneſſes, that he cauſed them to ſing miſerere, and before his vncle to confeſſe the trueth of the matter, and their principall intent. Whereof his vncle much reioycing, and vnderſtanding his innocencie, mooued them to declare the ſame before their maiſter, firſt taking his promiſe to pardon their offence: for (ſaieth hée) their acknowledgement ſhal frée them from puniſhment, which their maſter granting, they vnfolded euery circumſtance, which he particularly related againe to maiſter Deane and the prebends, who much commending his nephew, willed ſir Thomas to place him at the ſinging ſchoole, and promiſed, that ſo ſoone as he could kéepe any conſort, or beare a part, they would benefice him in the Cathedrall. For which he humbly thanking them, departed home in great content and peace of minde.
            
            
               ¶ How Dobſon reuenged the quarrell of his friend vpon the Vſher. Chap. 4.
               
                  
                     GEorge Dobſon, euery day after this, ſo long as he continued at the reading ſchoole entred the liſts, and fought the combate with ſome one or other of his fellowes, wherein fortune ſo much fauoured him, as ſhée alwayes graunted him victory, and

hée brought them vnto ſuch ſlauery and ſubiection, that howſoeuer he vſed them, complaine they durſt not, vnleſſe the hurt were ſo apparant as that it could not be couered from their maiſters ſight, neyther then vpon examination dared any of them taxe him therewith, vnleſſe himſelfe did confeſſe the matter, which hée alwayes did with ſuch dexteritie, as he alwayes ſufficiently diſcharged himſelfe, and thruſt the blame vpon the party iniuried, whereunto no man vſed any contradiction: and the maiſter, in reſpect hée had found foorth their practiſes againſt him in former time, the rather tooke his word, and the leſſe beléeued them, whereby enſued to him a great deale of quiet: for they ſéeing him ſo ſtand to himſelfe, man forth his owne matter, and the maiſter ſo much on his ſide, that it was not poſſible to ſeparate him from his good conceiued opinion, by little and little they deſiſted from further abuſing him, contenting themſelues with onely laughing at him in ſecret. His vncle alſo became ſo hopefull of his well doing, that he likewiſe turned a deafe eare to all complaints that came againſt him, imagining that ſuch were rather vrged of mallice, as in former times than vppon any deſert, and ſo when as he could perfitly write and reade, hée remooued him thence to the ſinging ſchoole, where he profited ſo well, that in ſhort time he was fit for a Choriſters rowme, which to him was granted vpon the firſt motion made, the Deane himſelfe inſtalled him, and of his owne proper charge furniſhed him with gowne and ſurpleſſe, commaunding his vncle to reſerue the benefit of his place for his preferment to the vniuerſity of Cambridge or Oxford, when hée ſhould be ſufficient to be ſent thither. His vncle no ſmall man in regard Maiſter Deane ſo much reſpected his nephew, fitted him of euery thing conuenient to his eſtate, not permitting him to want any thing that the boy wold

demaund or ſay was néedeful: and perceiuing his vncle ſo much to dote vpon him, he plaid the wagge with more libertie then before, and being growne vp to a good ſturdy ladde, he firſt ſo handled the matter, that hée became captaine of Schooles, and ſo hampered the whole multitude as no man dared to offend him, but ſtudied by all poſſible means to inueſt themſelues into his fauor and friendſhip, whereof they being poſſeſſed, thought themſelues as ſure as if they had béene ſhutt vp in Warke caſtel, for to his fauourites none preſumed to offer iniury, or make complaint vpon them, neither the Vſher aduentured to puniſh for what offence ſoeuer; but by his conniuency, ſo much he feared his diſpleaſure, whereof he had vpon occaſions taſted, and hauing béene once vnder him at ſhrift, hée found him ſo ſtrict in the impoſition of penaunce, that hée neuer deſired afterward to vſe him any more for a ghoſtly father, and the matter came thus to effect. There was in the ſchoole one Raikebanes, whom Dobſon highly loued, and more eſtéemed of, than of all other fellowes, both in regard hée was borne in the country, and alſo for that his manners and conditions were more correſpondent to his humour than any others in that place: This Raikebaines one day when hée ſuppoſed that they ſhold haue licence ſo paſtime themſelues in the fields, brought with him to the ſchoole his artillery, purpoſing to beſtow that after noone in ſhooting, but his exſpectations prooued fruſtrate, for their ſuperior Maiſter Bromeley was at the ſame inſtant by his acquaintaunce inuited into the towne to a banquet, where he conceiuing to be longer detained from ſchoole than he could haue wiſhed, referred to the vſher the whole charge thereof, taking with him onely Debſon, becauſe hée was a pleaſantly diſpoſed gueſt, and apt to incite laughing, as alſo hauing a tunable voyce to aſſiſt him, if his company called

for a Song, the Vſher ſet in the top of his triumph, to manifeſt his authority, was ſo preciſe, that at no intreaty of gentlemen he would condeſcend to let the ſchollers goe abroad, notwithſtanding diuers of good reſpect made ſute for the ſame▪ all of whom he ſhakd off with an abſolute deniall; but ſome of them ſcorning to be too importunate, either to haue him thinke that they reſpected to reſt beholden to him for ſo ſimple a fauour, ſent to maſter Bromeley himſelfe, who willingly aſſented to their requeſts and diſmiſſed the ſchollers, notwithſtanding maſter Vſher his repugnancie to the contrary, and albeit that the day was farre gone before they were ſet at libertie, yet Raikebaines procured ſome of his beſt acquaintances to ſpend ſo much thereof as remained in ſhooting.
               And returning home towards night, in a valley betwixt the riuer and the wood, which banketh the riuer all alongſt as it enuironeth the citty, he eſpied M. Vſher at his meditations, whoſe preſence his ſtomacke was not able to digeſt for that hée had ſo peremptorily abridged them of that dayes recreation. And ſo ſpeaking to his companions, by my trueth (ſaith he) I diſcouer a Woodcocke by the water ſide, and I could find in heart to pick his head to the bones, and giue my dogges his fleſh, ſo doe I loue him, I would I were in France, vpon condition his noſe were of equall ſiſe with a natural woodcocks bill, I ſhould make a commoditie of his picture, I am aſſured, if not of the reall ſubſtance: Well ſir William, though I bée not of ſtrength ſufficient to deale with you at handy ſtroakes, and beat wit into your wooden head, yet my heart is good enough to hazzard with you at the ſpeares point: and as Hercules, vnable with ſpéede of foot to ouertake the Centaure, running away with his faireſt Deinira, ſent a meſſenger to ſtay him till his comming; ſo my ſelfe acknowledging my imbecillitie and weakeneſſe

to diſ-inable me to cloſe with you in armes, will neuertheleſſe fight afarre off, and diſpatch my poſte, by whoſe ſpéedy blaſt, you ſhall be let to vnderſtand how dearly I affect you: and therewithall pulling an arrow from vnder his girdle, he ſent it with a right good will, to bid ſir William good Euenſong, which lighting vppon the ſhirt of his gowne behinde, only feared him without any further harme. But hée turning about, and ſéeing from whence the flight was ſent, ſet himſelfe backe to méete them at the bridge foote, where making inquirie of the matter, the whole caſe was vnfolded and Rackebains attainted.
               The next morrow he complained to M. Bromley, and cauſed poore lames to be laſhed, at which Dobſon ſtorming made no great exterior ſhewe, yet purpoſed in heart to take a condigne reuenge vpon ſir William when opportunitie ſerued, which he performed within a ſhort time after, as you ſhall heare.
               Sir William had a chamber néere to M. Deanes own lodging, and the fore-doore opening into the great yard, (commonly called the Abbey garth, it had alſo a backe doore, by the which he might paſſe through M. Deanes kitchin garden into the Cathedrall, as alſo when it pleaſed him to take the benefite of the ſame, there hee might walke, or exerciſe any other recreation by M. Deanes licence, who for that he eſtéemed him a very honeſt yong man, and a painefull in ſchoole matters, authoriſed him to vſe the eaſement thereof: in a corner of this Garden was built a houſe for M. Deane his Poultrie, where hée had alwayes great ſtore féeding for his prouiſion, both Turkies, Capons, Fezants, and other of like ſort. Dobſon therefore vppon this iniury done to his friend, continually troubled his braine for reuenge, and after aduiſements, he ſuppoſed he could no way ſo ſufficiently come

quit with him, as to deuiſe ſome meane whereby to procure him M. Deanes alienation of good will, and loſſe of good liking; being therefore very intimate and familiar with the Boy that attended him in his chamber, hée was particularly informed of ſir Williams whole courſe and demeanor, and of all the benefits of his lodging. Dohſon then thinking that in reſpect ſir William onely had acceſſe into this garden, that if he could drawe the boyes aſſent vnto the practiſe of any knauery, either in the garden or about the Poultrie, that there might be occaſions good enough to ſet maſter Deanes ſtomacke againſt him became ſo entire with the boy as in ſhort ſpace he promiſed to concurre with Dobſon for the making vppe of any ieaſt, that might not tend to his own extreame preiudice, and his maiſters vtter infamy. For which Dobſon proteſting to regratiate both him, and to haue care of the circumſtances, lay ſtill in waite, when he might take ſir William napping, or fittely effect any thing whereby to worke him ſome notable ſhame; in the winter time when a ſnowe fell, he came to the Chamberlaine deſiring him to affoord him a paire of ſir William ſhooes, and that the ſame night when ſir William ſhould be aſleepe, that he would ſuffer him to enter the wooddeyard, where (ſaith he) I wil be ſo hardy as to take away one of maſter Deanes fatteſt Turkies, wherewith we will make merry and laugh in ſome conuenient place in the towne. O God forbid ſaid the Chamberer, for when the Turkie is wanting they will ſtraight ſuſpect me, becauſe I onely, and my maiſter the Deanes Poulterer excepted, haue recourſe into that place, and for my maiſter they know him honeſt enough, neither will they conceiue any iealouſie of him, but preſently they will accuſe and alſo cauſe mée to be puniſhed. Not ſo quoth Dobſon, for to preuent them therein I deſire to haue ſir Williams ſhooes, that they may

ſée that the print left in the ſnowe is of a mans foote, not of a boyes, which ſight will aſſuredly acquit thée: and knowing ſir Williams honeſtie in all former times, they will be brought to that exigent, that they ſhall not know what to doe or ſay: and héereupon they will be enforced to conceale it, leſt if accuſing thy maſter, the blame be thruſt vpon themſelues. The boy loath to diſpleaſe Dobſon, or to hazard his goodwill, condiſcended to his deſires, lent him a paire of his maſters ſhooes, and at his time appointed permitted him to haue frée paſſage through the houſe into the woodyard, from whence hée tooke away the fatteſt Turkie to his knowledge, and quietly conueying him by the ſame paſſage, leauing the ſhooes with the boy in the Chamber, hée carried the Turky to be dreſſed in the towne at a Cookes houſe of his acquaintance, wherewith hée feaſted ſuch of his friends as he made choice of, laughing to conſider how he intended to blonke ſir William: ſo when the morning came he conueyed himſelfe betimes to his vncles chamber, which was alſo in the ſame court, and had one window lighting into the ſame woodyard, thither he ſecretly conueyed himſelfe to attend the Poulterers comming to ſerue his birdes, who about his ordinary time came to bring them meate, and to ſée if he had all his number, where he miſſed (by the head) the Turky that was ſtollen. This want being extraordinary, amazed him: and hée could not deuiſe how it ſhould come to paſſe, if either ſome weaſell, ſtot, or poulecat had not deuoured her. But then againe he conſidered that ſo little a beaſt could not ſo diſpatch him, but that there would haue béene left ſome remainders; neither could he diſcerne which way any ſuch vermine could haue acceſſe vnto that place. To thinke that he was ſtollen, was but a méere imagination, as he ſuppoſed, ſince there was no way left to théeues, ſo that what to cenſure aright hée

was altogether ignorant.
               But while that he ſtood in this doubt and perplexitie, incertaine what to do or determine vpon, ſuddenly turning himſelfe about, he obſerued in the ſnow the print of a mans foot, which he traced from thence to Sir Williams backe doore, where he perceiued the entry of the ſame, and the exit likewiſe, which put him into a greater extaſie then before: ſometimes he thought without further queſtion this way hath my Maiſters Turky beene conueyed: and yet I muſe who ſhould do it, for I may bée well aſſured that Sir William would not ſo tricke mée for a world of riches, neither hath it beene done by his conſent either knowledge: for he promiſed to my Maiſter on his credit, that no other but himſelfe only and his boy that euer ſhould come into that place, and then to charge him with ſo foule a fact were great folly, and to my ſelfe it might procure great diſpleaſure. For firſt, if I ſhould obiect this againſt him, neither will my Maſter giue any eare thereto, either beleeue it, ſo highly ſtandeth Sir William in his fauour: neither will he for any time hereafter thinke well of me, for broaching ſuch a ſlaunder. And holding this no expedient courſe, before he proceeded any further in the matter, he returned into the kitchin, where he related to the Cookes what had chanced, requeſting them to aduiſe him what to do, who came all forth with him into the wood-yard to ſee how the caſe ſtood, & could as little ſay to the matter as himſelfe: diuers were their verdicts, and they varied all in their opinions: ſome ſti-mulated him to charge Sir William with the ſtealth, others wiſhed him to beware what he did: ſome aduiſed him to informe their Maſter, but the moſt part gaue him counſell to let it quietly paſſe, without making further to do about it, and rather to giue diligent attendance to the reſt: alleadging that if it were a ſteaith, ſeeing no ſtirre

to be made concerning this, the théefe would hazard to haue another, when he might be apprehended, and hée onely blamed and puniſhed who had committed the treſpaſſe. But while they were thus diuided in their iudgements, and as it were in mutinies among themſelues, Dobſon as though he had been ignorant of the whole caſe looking foorth at his Vnckles chamber window, deſired to know the cauſe of ſuch their debatings, whereof they made a briefe rehearſall. Alas, God helpe you, are you ſo ſimple as to thinke your Maiſters Turky gone by any other meane, then by him the print of whoſe foot you find in the ſnow: nay aſſure your ſelues, that whoſoeuers ſhooe that impreſſion doth fitte, hée is the perſon which hath committed the theft. And I would counſell you to take héed how you charge Sir William therewith: for albeit there be probable ſignes that it hath beene conueied thorow his chamber, yet his honeſty and good carriage is of ſuch regard, both with your Maſter, and the whole, as you ſhall incurre great blame by ſuch complaint, vnleſſe you were able to proue it againſt him, and therein I do ſuppoſe you will find difficulties, for he hath neuer yet béene conuicted of any miſdemeanor, and therefore take good aduiſe before you call him into queſtion. And in my opinion, to frée you of your iealoſie of him, it is the beſt courſe, to borrow one of his ſhooes, by which you may take a ſure trial whether it be he or not: and ſo may you deale with more ſecuritie, both in reſpect of him and your ſelues. This counſell was contenting to them all, and according to good reaſon. Knocking therefore at his chamber doore, he being yet in bed, they mooued his chamberer for one of his ſhooes, who ſuſpecting the cauſe of their requeſt, much againſt his ſtomacke brought to them one of the ſame which Dobſon had vſed in the ſtelth: which agreeing equally with the print, they were al both

very ſorrowfull and aſhamed in Sir Williams behalfe: but Dobſon was not a little ioyfull to ſée his deuiſe take ſuch fortunate effect. The Poulterer, as hee whom it more concerned then the reſt, called vp Sir William, and after ſome inuectiue ſpeeches, queſtioned him of the Turkies ſtelth: but he much meruailing why they ſhould ſo ſtrictly taxe him, when they had opened vnto him the likelyhoods, inducing them to charge him, proteſted vpon the holy Bible, that himſelfe was cléere and innocent of ſuch fellony: and aſſured them further, that neither man nor child had entrance that way by his meanes, or vpon his knowledge: and as for my boy (ſaith he) I dare alſo giue to you my word, that hee neuer commeth in place, but when my ſelfe am preſent; that is, when wée goe and come from ſeruice. But all this would not ſuffice to excuſe Sir William, Dobſon ſo vrged the Poulterer to informe Maiſter Deane thereof: for (ſaith he) if you ſhall faile to do it, I will cauſe my vncle to complain of you: for otherwiſe Sir William clearing himſelfe in this manner, it may be ſuppoſed, that my vncle or I are acknowne thereof, becauſe our chamber window hath a proſpect into the wood-yard; but by your patience ſir, you ſhall not blocke vs ſo: and therefore as you will anſwere it when you ſhall heare thereof, it is your faireſt meane to tell firſt, leſt you bée let to vnderſtand the ſame to your diſpleaſure. And thus backed with Dobſons threatnings, he acquainted his Maiſter with all as you haue heard. Maiſter Deane inraged againſt Sir William, ſent for him, and in the preſence of the Prebends examined him of the ſame, who proteſted as before, that he did not know thereof. Well, (ſaid Maiſter Deane) Sir William, we will take your word, and pardon the fault, but yet the probabilitie of the matter maketh vs to miſdoubt you; and from henceforth wee will interrupt you

of that walke, and intreat you to take a little more pains and goe about. At which ſentence paſſed, Sir William inwardly repined, that the peoples eares ſhould be filled with theſe ſuſpitions, and to haue his doores ſhut vp. But howſoeuer it greeued him, he muſt inforce his patience: and ſo with ſolemne proteſtation of his innocency, for that time he departed home, both ſorrowfull and aſhamed.
               
                  Dobſon well pleaſed to haue procured him this drie Bob at Maiſter Deanes hands, was yet notwithſtanding not fully ſatiſfied with this reuenge of his friends wrong, but determined yet further, when time ſerued, to pay him all that he had promiſed, ſcorning to dye in his debt: and therefore continuing ſtil friendly with his Chamberlaine, he vnderſtood that Sir William was about a wife, a Marchants daughter in the Towne, a pretty fiſgig girle, and who to humor Sir William, would many times repaire to his chamber, eſpecially in the winter euenings, when the neighbours could not ſo wel obſerue her walkes as at other times when the dayes were longer, and the euenings more lightſome: Oftentimes ſhe would kéepe him company all the night, vntill fiue of the clocke in the morning, at which houre ſhe commonly departed, that ſhe might be at home before her father was vp & came abroad forth of his chamber, who knew nothing of her vagaries which her mother permitted, vpon the confident truſt ſhe had in Sir William his honeſt vſage of her, who had moued her huſband and her ſelfe in the matter, crauing their fauourable aſſents, of whom they conceiued a ſingular good liking, and deſired to accompliſh the match with him, conditionally that Maiſter Deane would aſſure him his place by pattent during his life, but thereof he was quite hopeleſſe in reſpect of his late accident, and dared not to make ſuit for

it; and thereuppon they deferred to giue their conſents, eſpecially the merchant himſelfe, but the maide being much affected toward him, and longing to be a miſtris in the Abbey, frequented his company as before is ſaid: whereof Dobſon being perfitely inſtructed by the chamberer, laboured his wittes, without intermiſſion, how to gall ſir Williams delicates with ſome bitter ſirrope of diſgrace: and hauing a nimble head and working braine, he thus effected his drift, hée learned of the boy what night they had appointed for their next méeting at his maiſters chamber, which the boy diſcouered vnto him: but whie deſireſt thou to know, ſaid he, fearing ſome ſuch pretence as before he had drawne him vnto? O nothing ſaid Dobſon, but if then thou couldſt be abſent, I ſhould be gladde to haue thy company at the ſigne of the Foare, where I haue ſet downe that night to meete certaine Gentlemen of the countrey, to whome I haue promiſed a ſong, and a ſet of muſicke, and I ſhall thinke my ſelfe much in thy debt if thou wilt be there to ſing the Meane amongſt vs, which if thou ſhalt doe, the leaſt parte of their liberalitie ſhall not be thine.
               Say no more (ſayd the boy) for if miſtris Iane hold her appoyntment, and lodge with my maiſter all the night, ſo ſoone as they are gone to bed, I will not faile to be one among you, but if they ſit vp all night, then I cannot be away, for that I muſt be ſent into the towne for wine, or ſome other conceit, as they ſhall thinke good. Why then ſaide Dobſon, this is all that we may reſolue, that if ſhe come according to promiſe, and occaſion ſerue that thou mayeſt preſent thy ſelfe with vs, then we ſhall haue thy company; and if otherwiſe, thou ſhalt certifie me, to the end that we may prouide another to ſupply thy want: Thereof be you aſſured ſaide the boy, and make no doubt: that ſufficeth, quoth Dobſon, and ſo farewell. The boy

tooke his direct courſe to his miſtris chamber, and Dobſon his to certaine of his déereſt friends, whom hée deſired to affoord him their aſſiſtance in the ſtealing of a Diere the next tueſday enſuing, for ſaith he, a kinſwoman of mine in the country who longeth for veniſon, hath ſent to mée to prouide her. I haue both intreated for her, and offered money, but cannot procure her a ſimple fée, and rather than ſhe ſhall receiue harme for the want thereof, I will hazard to fetch one foorth of Beares parke, ſo I may intreate your good helpes. And if Fortune fauour our attempts, looke what ſhall be more than to ſtay her longing, ſhall be at your owne diſpoſing, neither ſhall you feare any inconuenience to come thereof: for if that our chaunce ſhould be ſo euill as to be taken, I truſt well that my vnckle will worke our attonement with Maiſter Deane, and ſet vs frée from puniſhment, and in reſpect of that fauor I ſhall reſt wholy yours at all times to pleaſure you. Dobſons reputation was ſuch amongſt the caualieroes in the citty, that he could not ſo eaſily requeſt, as they aſſent to effect his deſires, aſſuring that to do him anie pleaſure, they were all at all times ready to abide any penalty of the law, without exſpectation of fauour, or forbearaunce: for he ſaide, he who will ſtand foorth to help his friends neceſſity for any feare, is not worthy the name of a good fellow, and therefore make choice of your time, and we wil not be wanting to goe with you, which they performed according to his aſſignement. And by the helpe of their greyhounds, they quickely had killed their game, and truſſing her vpon a horſe, they brought her ſafely away, the Kéepers that night neglecting their watch. Dobſon directed them to an Inne in the towne, where he deſired them to attend his comming, which ſhould be within an houre after. And when he once ſuppoſed them to be ſafe in the houſe, hée went to the Kéepers

Lodge in the Parke, willing them to riſe, for this night, ſaieth hée, one of your diere is ſlaine and carried hence, as I coniecture, for comming this éeuening to my vncle Pharaoes, I mette her vpon the ſhoulders of foure good fellowes, and (to my iudgement) ſhe is carried to ſir Williams chamber, the vſher of the ſinging ſchoole, ſo that if your ſelfe did not beſtow her vpon him, I beléeue that there you ſhal find both hir and the parties that haue committed the ſlaughter; for among them I could perfitly diſcerne ſir William, and his brother Robert: what the other were I could not ſo well obſerue, for they ſhunned my way a little, and my ſelfe was loath to be eſpied of them: and therefore now that I haue diſcharged my loue and duety to maiſter Deane, and my good will to you: deale you herein as reaſon and the cauſe requireth, and herewith he departed poſting after his companions as he could, vntill hée came to the Inne, where hée had appointed them to ſtay, and ſir Williams boy to méete him, who had continued there the moſt parte of the night to attend his comming. Dobſon commaunding the cookes to make ready the veniſon, taking his companion aſide, aſked him if miſtris Iane were with ſir William or not: yea and by this aſléepe betwixt his armes: and ſo let her be, quoth Dobſon, we ſhall fare the better for their ſakes, God ſend them ioy at their ariſing, and ſo going into the company againe, they fell to ſporting vntill the veniſon was made ready.
               The kéeper of Beareſparke much mooued at Dobſons relation, without further delayes leapt from his bed, and hauing put vppon him his apparrell, away he paſed to Dunholme in haſte, neuer ſo much as breathing till hée came to the Deanes lodging, where knocking at the gates, hée commaunded the Porter to let him in, for he had ſerious matters to deliuer to his maiſter, and that

preſently, being brought to his bed chamber, and admitted to ſpeake, he made rehearſall of Dobſons report, further annexing, that if it would pleaſe his worſhippe to ariſe, and to make ſearch in ſir Williams chamber, at this inſtant wée ſhall take all them who haue doone iniurie to your worſhip, and murdred the game. The Deane beléeuing that euery thing was euen ſo as he had ſaide, hauing him in ſuſpition for his Turkey, aroſe in a great chafe againſt ſir William, and cauſed his men to call vp ſo many of the prebends as were then in the towne, to aſſiſt him. They much maruelling what occaſions he had to imploy them at that time of the night: they made great haſte to come to his lodging, whither when they were all arriued, he declared the cauſe of his diſturbing of them ſo extraordinarily, crauing their pardon, becauſe (ſaith he) if I ſhould tolerate him to procéede in theſe courſes, hée will doe ſhame to vs all, in the face of the world; and for that you ſhall not ſuppoſe that I runne againſt him vpon méere ſuggeſtions, or ſplenatiue informations, I haue therefore requeſted your preſences, that you might be eye-witneſſes of his abuſes done againſt me: for notwithſtanding that by my meanes he was not onely placed in the Schoole, as you all know, but alſo was allowed the pleaſures of my gardens, and orchards, vntill ſuch time as my Turkie was (through his default) taken away and ſtolne, which I pardond him with the only abridgement of my garden contents, and the pleaſures he thereby receiued: but in requitall of my benignities he hath this night with other his confederates and looſe fellowes gone into my Parke and ſtolne away one of my diere, and at this inſtant, in his chamber, is feaſting there with the aſſociates of his knaueries, whither I requeſt you all to accompany me, that they may be all arreſted, and vndergoe ſuch penalty as the law to ſuch offendors hath limited,

for I perceiue, that further to forbeare him, is but to ſtimulate and egge him forwards to all other fortes of diſorder. Vnto which his ſpeech, they giuing a generall applauſe, ſette forward with him to ſearch ſir Williams chamber, who (poore man) fearing no ſuch matter, was layd arme in arme with his ſwéete miſtris Iane: and as he ſuppoſed, ſecure enough. But we ſee no man ſo much in daunger as he who dreadeth none. Sir William unbracing his ſweet miſtris is awaked foorth of his dreams, and commanded to ſ
                     •
                  t open his doores that maſter Dean may come in: O good Lord, who can explane the perplexities he conceiued at the name of Maiſter Deane? Alas ſayd he to miſtris Iane, what ſhall we now do? or courſe ſhall we take to keepe you from his ſight? ſor at the backe doore I can not diſmiſſe you, for he hath cauſed that paſſage to be barred vp ſo ſtrongly, as that it can not be broken: nay, and perhappes his buſines is into the wooddeyeard, and then that were the worſt of all other courſes, conueiaunce I haue none to hide you in, and if I ſhoulde thruſt you into my ſtudy, it is to be doubted that there he will finde you: and I had rather go bare foote to Rome, than that hee ſhould ſo ouertake vs, for we were not only vndone, but ſhamed for euer. It is woonder to mee what hee hath to do with me thus late in the night, or what ſhould mooue him to come hither in th
                     •
                  s manner, vnleſſe ſome of purpoſe haue giuen him intelligence of your being heere.
               The yong girle not able to aduiſe him, qu
                     •
                  king for feare, and ready to ſincke with ſhame, prayed him to thruſt her vnder the bed, for ſure ſaith ſhe, he wil haue no occaſion to ſee
                     •
                  e there for any thing, and caſting her cloathes about her as it would bée, ſhee crept vnder the bed her ſelfe, and ſir William couered her with an old carpet: but the Deane offended that he made no more ſpeed

to let him into the houſe, perſwading himſelfe, that he of purpoſe kept him there, till he had conueighed his aſſociates and the veniſon out of ſight, commanded his men violently, to breake open the doores, and enter the houſe: all which they did, and lighting vp torches, gaue way for M. Deane and the Prebends to come in; who ſtrictly examined ſir William of his companions and the veneſon, charging him to tell them where hee had beſtowed them, and it. (But ſir William Godwot) though his conſcience teſtified vnto him that he was acceſſarie to no ſuch action, yet vpon this heauie taxe of M. Deane, hée was ready to fall dead before them, ſwearing and proteſting that he neuer came into that parke, day nor night about any ſuch purpoſe, humbly praying M. Deane to pardon him, and to alter ſuch his conceits, for (ſaith he) I am a true and iuſt man. But at this reply, the Kéeper aſſured M. Deane that the very ſame night one Deare was killed, and that he who told him thereof, could not be miſtaken of ſir William. M. Deane there vpon, notwithſtanding all his ſolempne proteſtations, commanded to ſearch euery corner of the chamber, and vnder the bed, where they found the poore Doe in a colde palſie, who for ſhame to be ſo taken, ſownded in the preſence of them all, and was ready to giue vp the ghoſt: ſir William became mute, and fared like a man deſtraughted. The Deane and Prebends blamed him very much, and threatned to puniſh theſe diſorders, yet all did their indeuors to bring Miſtreſſe Iane to her perfect ſenſes againe. And when ſhe was recouered they ſent her home to her mothers houſe, willing her mother to reſpect more her daughters honeſtie and good name. Dobſon and his aſſociats were thruſt in among the ſearchers, and laughed their parts at ſir William his interprize. The Deane and Prebends returned home to their beds, ſo blanked with

this bob, that they could not tell what to conceite other, then that ſome mad braine fellow, either ſpiting at, or meaning to make a ſcorne of ſir William, had of purpoſe plotted it: but before the morning was blaſed through the citie the whole accedents, at which a number made good paſtime. Poore Miſtreſſe Iane kept her cloſet, aſhamed to péepe out of doores, vntill her father taking the matter in ſnuffe, went to M. Deane and the Prebends, deſiring them to conſtraine ſir William to make amends to his daughter, and in the ſight of the people to marry her: whith they compelled him to doe, and to gratifie the Marchant, they confirmed him a pattent of the Vſherſhip as largely as he deſired and contrary to his expectation. After this the truth of the matter was publiſhed, neither did any man diſallowe of Dobſons bob, and ſir William euer after was carefull not to offend him, or any of his friends.
            
            
               How Dobſon deceiued his friend Raikebaines of a Pudding, and how hee ſhut him vp in the Candle cupbord. The fifth Chapter.
               
                  
                     DObſon ſéeing his matches to make ſo wel and his contrinings to come to ſo good a paſſe, broke his Bobbes on each mans noſe, without reſpect, he ſpared no perſons but as occaſion was offered, he played the wagge, ſometime in the city, other while in the countrey, by meanes whereof his fame ſpread it ſelfe all ouer: and all pleaſantly diſpoſed humouriſts, ſought to be acquainted with him, although he were but

yet a ſcholler: neither did at chiue any ſmall commendations for his practiſe againſt Sir William. But before this he had plotted diuers others in the ſchools amongſt his fellowes, whereof one was this: Rakebaines (of whom before we haue ſpoken) was borne in the countrey ſixe miles diſtant from Dunhoime, whither he was ſent to the ſchoole, to be inſtructed in good letters, and ſundry good manners ſitting his eſtate and parentage. He was tabled with a ſiſter of his mothers married to a Lawyer in the Citie, who had alſo a ſonne which daily did accompany him to the ſchoole, as very a wagge as the beſt, yet he alwaies more ſmoothly carried his knaueries then Rakebaines did; neuer putting his hand to any action, but when he was aſſured of another betwixt him & the halter. This Raikebains father being a gentleman of good port and great hoſpitalitie, kept continually a liberall and bountifull houſe; and toward Chriſtmas time he killed euery yeare great ſtore of beaſts. His mother to applaud her ſonnes content, at ſuch times alwayes ſent to him and her nephew ſome ſtore of puddings: which he, to thend he might braue of his mothers reſpect toward him amongſt his fellow ſcholers, would many times carry with him to the ſchoole, therewith to breake his faſt, when the reſt were licenſed to goe home, or to their Innes, which ordinarily they were wont to doe at eight a clocke in the morning. So it happened his coſin to be ſicke, Raikebaines was to goe to ſchoole alone; he thought it better to carry his breakefaſt with him, then to trouble himſelfe to come ſo farre for it. And becauſe he thought there was nothing ſo fit for his carriage as a pudding▪ he deſired the maid to beſtow one vpon him, which his requeſt ſhe aſſented vnto. But when it approached néere breakefaſt time, he tooke great care how to haue it ſafely warmed, and that it might not bée

ſnatched from him: and therefore fearing the diſorders of his fellowes, he intreated Dobſon to affoord his aſſiſtance, and to ſtand his friend: which if he ſhould do, he promiſed to ſhare it equally betwixt them. Dobſon purpoſing in ſtéed of an inch to take an ell, and for the whole ſcarcely to returne the ſkinne, prepared a place for it before the fire, and would not permit any man to come during the time it was in making hot. And before that it was thorowly warmed, the clocke ſtroke eight, and euerie man departed except Dobſon and Raikebaines, who ſtaid expecting til the pudding ſhould be warme enough. Dobſon hauing the promiſe of the halfe, ſate deuiſing how he might poſſeſſe him of the whole: and ſo when he perceiued it to be hot enough: Iames (ſaith he) looke out at the window, and ſee whether any of them be returning to the ſchoole or not: for if they ſhall come before we haue made an end, they will ſo moleſt vs, that wée ſhall not eate it in quiet: ſo that if thou doſt eſpy any of them to be néere hand, wée will conuey our ſelues into ſome corner, vntill we haue made diſpatch thereof. But whileſt Iames Rakebaines was aſcending into the window, to do as he was aduiſed, away goeth Dobſon with the pudding thorow the Church and Cloiſter, into the Cannons hall, wherein ſhutting himſelfe, and faſt bolting the doores, he feaſted himſelfe with the whole pudding: but Raikebanes in hope to recouer ſome part at the leaſt, purſued him with huy and cry through Church and Cloiſter, vntill he came to the Common hall, where finding the doores bolted, he ſtayed knocking and exclaiming the ſpace of an houre▪ but could haue no entrance, neither any aunſwere. In the meane time while hée there continued rapping and calling to his friend, ſometimes imperiouſly commaunding Dobſon to part ſtake, and to make equall diuidence with him: otherwhile intreating

him to reward him with ſome ſmall portion, who once was owner of the whole. Sir Thomas paſſing that way from his chamber to the Chancel, hearing him many times to nominate Dobſon, came to know the cauſe of his diſturbance. Rakebaines fully confiding by his helpe to haue either his pudding, 
                     〈◊〉
                   ſome part thereof reſtored, diſeleſed to him all the circumſtances aforeſaid: who much offended for his wrongs receiued, commaunded Dobſon to appeare in his likeneſſe, and to come to his anſwere: he hearing the voyce of his vncle, came ſtreight to the doores, and vnboulting the ſame, patiently heard all that euer could be obiected againſt him, vnto the which he made this reply. Vncle (ſaith he) you may do as you ſée cauſe, in beléeuing him or me, but ſurely hée hath foreſkipped and told to you my tale, for my Aunt Pharoe ſent me this pudding vpon Saturday laſt, which I reſerued vntill now. And in very deed, becauſe I feared that whileſt I were called by my Maiſter to ſing, or other exerciſe, haply it might haue béen ſtollen from me, I intreated him to giue reſpect thereto till it were warmed, and to recompence his paines I promiſed to beſtow vpon him ſome part thereof: but he would néedes be his owne caruer, and either haue the greater halfe, or none: which becauſe he refuſed to ſtand to my beneuolence, and the pact made betwixt vs, I haue wholly diſpatched, and haue left him none thereof: and for this cauſe he cryeth and exclaimeth againſt me, as you heare. Raikebaines perceiuing by Dobſons countenance, that if he ſhould reply againſt him, or deny any thing which Dobſon had ſaid to be true, that he ſhould then for euer looſe his friendſhip, ſéemed to yéeld to his affection, and to graunt his defenſorie ſpéech for truth, contenting himſelfe both to brooke the iniurie, and eke to beare the blame.
               
                  Sir Thomas ſéeing no great cauſe vppon the rehearſall made by both the parties why to chide his nephew, requeſted Raikebaines to acquiet himſelfe for that time, and charged thother no more ſo to diſ-taſte his familiar frind: But it was not long before Dobſon had forgot his vncles ſtrict iniunction, and his promiſe of better vſing his friends: for it was his humour, neuer to play one ſhrewd turne alone, but being of a ſcrupulous conſcience, hée payed euer his debts double ouer, and ſcorned to reſtore the capitall ſumme without the intereſt, and therefore once more he made bolde with his fellow, curbing his exſpectations: and becauſe Lent was at hand, hée prepared him to obſerue the faſt. This ſame yéere his vnckle ſir Thomas was choſen Choraſter of the Cathedrall, and to ſet vp the tapers at the times of ſeruice, both morning and euening, from the feaſt of Saint Martine, vntill the feaſt of March. Sir Thomas, whether it were that leuing his bed well in a morning, he was loath to riſe ſo earely in that cold ſeaſon, or otherwiſe, for that he would haue his nephew to haue experience in theſe offices, whereunto in future times he might be elected and promoted, and not to be to learne when he ſhould be placed therein. He made him his ſubſtitute, and appointed him to lighten and extinguiſh the tapers and candles, ſpecially in the mornings: which Dobſon diligently performed with the aſſiſtance of his fellowes, who in hope to haue ſome of the ſhort ends which could no more bée ſet vp for the Church ſeruice did dayly both before and after prayers, which were to be done at ſixe of the clock in the morning, helpe him in the ſaid office. And principally this Rakebains attended him more then any of the reſt, to whom in reſpect of his diligence he had promiſed the ſquare end of a great taper, at the laying vp of the lights: which when Dobſon was ſhutting of the cubboord, as ſéeming to

haue forgot his promiſe Raikebaines demaunded. Dobſon intending to intrappe him, threw it to the further end of the cupboord, ſo farre, that it was not poſſible to reach to it, vnleſſe that one of them ſhould créepe in, which Raikebaines offered to doe, rather than that he would want the commoditie of the candle, and ſo preſently ſkipped into the candle cupboord, to fetch away the Taper: but Dobſon lockt faſt the doores and departed thenſe to the ſchools, leauing Raikebaines to play the Cat, and warrant his tapers from the tyranny of the Rattes, where he ſate ſhut vp howling and crying, from halfe houre paſt ſixe, vntill almoſt tenne in the ſorenoone, at which time ſir Thomas and other the Canons came to put vpon them their Surpliſes, in which ordinarily they ſoong their Seruice, and which, for readineſſe ſake, they kept continually lying in preſſes there.
               
                  Raikebaines hearing the ſound of voyces, and the noyſe of mens feete, cried forth ſo lowde as he could, to the great admiration of ſir Thomas, and the reſidue of the Cannoniſts, who ſpeaking in at the key hole, aſked who it ſhuld be that was in his candle-cupboord, It is I, quoth Raikebaines. And who are you ſaid ſir Thomas? Iames Raikebains replied he. Alas quoth ſir Thomas, how cameſt thou into that place? and how long haſt thou ſit there? Euer ſince halfe an houre after ſixe this morning aunſwered Raikebaines, and your nephew Dobſon ſhut me heere, becauſe I went into the cupboord to fetch forth the end of a taper which himſelfe had promiſed to beſtow vpon me, for helping him to gather and extinguiſh the lights after praier. Sir Thomas pittying the poore boy, almoſt ſtarued with cold and hunger, went to ſeeke for his nephew Dobſon in the Schooles to ſet Raikebaines at liberty, threatning to puniſh him for his miſ-vſage. But Dobſon excuſed himſelfe, and ſaid that Raikebains icapt into the cupboord contrary

to his will, and ſwore that he would not come from thence, vnleſſe that he had a whole candle which hée had eſpied in the furtheſt corner, which I neither would, neither durſt doe without your conſent, and therefore did I thinke it very fit that he ſhould abide your comming, and now it is in your choice to beſtow vpon him, or not, and therewith vnlocking the doores, ſéely Raikebaines was ſcarcely able to crawle foorth, his ioynts were ſo ſtiffened and benummed with cold. Sir Thomas ſomewhat to eaſe his extreamities beſtowed vpon him a couple of candles, and liberally rewarded Dobſon with a bobbe vppon the mouth, inſomuch as the blood followed his fiſt, and that done, attiring himſelfe in his roabes, he went forward to doe his ſeruice in the Chauncell, leauing Dobſon and Raikebaines further to decide the caſe betwixt themſelues at the candle cupboord.
            
            
               How Dobſon reuenged himſelfe vpon his vncle. Chap. 6.
               
                  
                     DObſon was much diſcōtented for the blow giuen vnto him by his vncle, yet conſidering how well hee had deſerued the ſame, in regard of the iniurie done to his frend, he reconciled himſelfe again to Raikebans, with promiſe, that if hee would forgette that diſcurteſie, he neuer more would wrong, iniurie, or diſgrace him, but patronize his cauſe againſt all opponants of what ſort ſoeuer, in which he kept touch with him as by the vſage of ſir William the Vſher appeared. Raikebanes being of a gentle and good nature eaſily pardoned the offence, and ioyning hands, they proteſted to continue

perfit Friends each to other during their liues, and ſo returned to the Schoole wel ſatiſfied, where Dobſon ſate all the day oppreſſd with melancholy, caſting his thoghts vp and downe, how to come cleare with his Vncle, but hée could not apprehend any occaſion in the worlde as then: yet gaue hée not ouer to exſpect, or vrge ſome fit opportunitie of reuenge, and after diuerſe purpoſes which miſſed him, in the end he thus reſolued. At the Vncle of S. Giles, his Vncle had a very faire Orchard, in which euery yéere he had growing great abundance of goodly and pleaſant fruites, for which he was ſo careful, that alwayes nigh vnto the time of their ripening, he hired ſometimes one, ſometimes two fellows to watch his Orchards in the night ſeaſon, and to defend his fruits from ſtealing. Dobſon hauing a goodwill to eaſe his ſtomake vpon his Vncle, agréed with certaine of his merry acquaintances, one night in Apple-time to enter the Orchard, and from thence to conueigh ſuch fruite as poſſibly they were able to beare, promiſing to aſſiſt them himſelfe, intreating them if they were moleſted, to beate well and ſoundly the Kéepers thereof, and to vſe his Vncle as he would deuiſe, if he came to their ſuccours: him (ſaith hée) when you haue gagged, and bound the two Kéepers ſo ſurely that they cannot mooue, or doe you any incombrance, I would haue you to put into a ſacke, binding firſt his handes and féete, and permitting onely his head to appeare leſt he ſhould be ſmootherd, gagging him likewiſe leſt he cry, and be redéemed of his neighbours, then in ſome place of the orchard where the trées be thickeſt, I wiſh to haue him truſſed vp by the héeles, where let him hang till he waxe more tender, for he is old and too tough for the ſpit: And for my ſelfe, I purpoſe that time to be abſent from the houſe, becauſe you ſhall not bée hindred by me, nor interrapted: but be ſure that you

binde not my Vncle too hard, neither yet giue any great blowes, but with as much facilitie as you can, binde as I haue inſtrncted you, wherein, if you ſhall accompliſh my deſire, I ſhall thinke my ſelfe both bounden vnto you for helping me ſo be reuenged, and alſo I ſhalbe willing to repay your kindnes, when any occaſion thereof is miniſtred.
               They willed him to take no further thought, than only to deuiſe a meane for his owne abſenting, and they would performe all the reſt as he had directed, the next Wedneſday night inſuing. Dobſon thanked them, and vpon Wedneſday hée entreated his Vncle to licence him to go ſée his father and other friends in the country: For Vncle (ſaith hee) I haue not béene there nowe the ſpace of theſe tenne yeeres, and I am very deſirous to viſite them, and for two dayes to be merry amongſt them, vnto which his deſire, his vncle condeſcended: and Dobſon (ſéeming to him to go to his father) paſſed no further then into the Towne, to forward theſe fellows in the execution of their intended ſtratageme, he went therefore firſt vnto a Carpenters ſhop, and cauſed a horſe of wood to be made, with a ſword, dagger, and diſtaffe of the ſame, all the which he gotte planted in a gorgeous manner, and bringing them to his companions vppon wedneſday at night; hée goeth with them to the vtter ſide of the Orchyard, where taking downe two pale boordes, which hée before had looſened, they made themſelues a way to enter. They, ſo ſoone as they were within, begaune to lay agood amongſt the Apple trées, making a great ruſhing and noyſe, of purpoſe: the kéepers came to know their intents, and to bring them before ſir Thomas, but the conflict was vnequall, for they were fire againſt twoo: yet being ſturdy fellowes, of a good ſtomacke, and ſtanding vpon the iuſtneſſe of their quarrell, encountred them

all very luſtily, vntill the one of them was beaten downe to the ground, and the other being ouermatched, fledde into the Vicarage, and tolde ſir Thomas how the caſe did ſtand. At the hearing whereof, hée aroſe in great haſte, calling vp alſo his houſe-kéeper, willing her to follow after him with the broach, and to kill the firſt with whom ſhée incountred: for, ſaith he, this nights worke ſhall bée memorable in Dunholme, while there is one ſtone thereof ſtanding. And fearing leſt he ſhould not be well happed with blowes, caſting his gowne looſely about his ſhoulders, foorth hée marched, and the olde beldame his ſiſter with a broach, and the kéeper of the Orchard with a portigan. But while ſir Thomas was making himſelfe ready for the fight within, the théeues had chained the other fellow whome before they had beaten downe, and alſo had gagged him ſo well, that he could not cry, and were exſpecting cloſe by the doores, when ſir Thomas wold ſally foorth, they tripped his héeles at vnawares, béeing néerer at hand than hée looked for, and muffled him in his gowne, vntill they had made him ready for the ſacke: Then taking his gowne they put it vppon his ſiſter, and tying her handes behinde her, they ſet her vpon the wooden horſe, as Dobſon had preſcribed, and bound her téete vnder his belly, which doone, they girde her about with the painted ſword and dagger, ſetting vpon hir head a paper hatte with a buſh of peacocke feathers eaualiere like, ready to chalenge euery man to the combate, and in this gniſe they placed her vnder a peare ſrée. Sir Thomas did they thruſt into a ſacke, and by his nephews aduiſe, who fearing that ſo long hanging by the héetes, as til the next morrow, might procure him ſome infirmity, they reared him into the ſame peare trée aboue his ſiſter, and making for him a chaire of eſtate of the boughes, they bound in the one haud the diſtaffe, and in his other, a ſkimmerand

ſpreading his armes, they faſtned him by the wreſts vnto the braunches that were next him. While ſome of them were thus in hand with ſir Thomas, and his houſekeeper, the other tooke the twowarders, and bound and gagged them as is aforeſaide: they faſtned their handes about a appletrée, turning their hoſe down beneath their knées, ſo as their buttocks were ſet naked to the trée, faſtning them to the truncke below. Beſides the gagges, they putte into either of their mouthes, a bunch of Maie, and a pricking Thorne: and before them they heaped a bundle of bauine, and other drie wood in forme of a fire, and the broach hung full of apples as it were to be roſted. Then taking ſo much fruit as them liked, they departed home, leauing ſir Thomas and his ſeruitours to kéepe the watch.
               
                  Dobſon very timely in the morning repaired to the vicarage, and knowing his vncles neceſſitie, hée paſſed thorow the houſe into the orchard, to take a view of his deuiſes: and when he came vnto the peare trée wherein his vncle was inthronized, he called vppe to him, in ſorrowfull manner wringing his handes, and as it would be, wreſted foorth ſome ſmall number of teares. But his vncle ſate as a man who had periſht the vſe of his tong, for ſpeake he could not, in regarde of his gagge, neyther could he mooue, or make any ſigne, they had ſo ſtreightned all his ioynts. His Aunt alſo buckled vpon her prancing courſer in martiall manner, like Bellona goddeſſe of battell, ſate dareing Mars and all his chiualrie: and the two kéepers in their diſguiſes, like Tantalus, ſtoode gaping, as though they would haue catcht the apples off from the broach, but could not reach them. Dobſon to perſwade his vncle that he was ignorant of this practiſe, ranne howling vp and downe the orchard, as it were, affrighted with this lamentable ſight, and from thence into

the ſtréetes, calling the neighbours all about to come to his aſſiſtance. The people vpon his outery flocked in heapes into the orchard, to ſée what the matter was, much lamenting ſir Thomas his euill chaunce, the rather, for that it was done ſo priuately, as that they had no intelligence, either to haue preuented, or to haue redreſſed his wrongs. But it was no time then to debate the matter, his preſent caſe required more their helping handes, to vnbinde him, than their aduiſe how an other time to preuent the like miſfortune: So ſome bringing a ladder, ſcaled vp the tree where he ſa
                     •
                  e, and vnbinding his armes, they brought him downe ſo tenderly as they could in blankets, fearing, becauſe he could not ſpeake, that with extreamity of colde, hée was fallen into ſome ſowning palſie: and being in ſome hope, that by warmneſſe hee might be brought to his ſenſes againe, they carried him into the houſe, and placed him in his bed, foorth of the which he ſtirred not for the ſpace of thrée daies, neither all that time could he ſpeake one word, either receiue any meate, but onely ſuch liquide ſirropes as his kéeper powred into him with ſpoones: The Phiſitions were in ſome doubt of his recouery of health, for which Dobſon was vnfainedly ſorrowfull, and repented that euer hée deuiſed ſuch a ſtratageme. His Awnt was ſicke for a tweluemoneth after: But the two yong fellowes whoſe ſpirites were more quicke and liuely, after they had bin ſet before the fire, and lapped well in warme clothes, beganne to recouer themſelues. And as they perceiued their tongues able to mooue, they vnfolded all the caſe as if came to paſſe. The neighbours very penſiue for their Curates miſchaunce, diligently attended about him, till hée was able to doe for himſelfe. And Dobſon ſent for his mother, to take charge of the houſe, during the time of his infirmity. But ſir Thomas, whether that he merrily conceiued,

or otherwiſe was certainely informed, that Dobſon was the plotter of this deuiſe in all after times, tooke ſuch exceptions againſt him, as that no action of his was gratefull or acceptable in his ſight, where at Dobſon more ſtorming than before, as opportunitie ſorted to his deſignements, hée repayed all his vncles diſcountenances with meaſurable diſgraces; yet keeping a more moderate courſe, and giuing reſpect that hée did no more hazard his vncles life and welfare.
            
            
               How Dobſon cauſed his vncles horſe to be impownded, becauſe he denied to let him goe with him into the Countrey. Chap. 7.
               
                  WHen ſir Thomas was perfitly recouerd of his agew, hee was inuited by diuerſe of his friends into the countrey, to paſſe awaie ſome parte of the ſummer, perſwading him that the freſh aire was both comfortable and wholeſome after his ſo long ſickeneſſe: and it was about the Whitſontide, when the country people hauing affections to be merry, Dobſon requeſted his vnckle to graunt him leaue to accompany him, and to ſtéede him in place of a ſeruingman: but ſir Thomas thinking it a thing inconuenient, to committe the whole care of his houſe to his ſiſter alone, who was an olde decrepite creature, not able to mooue herſelfe without a ſtaffe, much leſſe vnfitte to make reſiſtance, if any knowing their abſence ſhould breake into the houſe, and offer to ſpoyle him of his ſtuffe and treaſure. Againe, he ſuppoſed Dobſon made ſuch requeſt,

onely to neglect and commit ſome knauery there, whereby to make himſelfe as famous in the countrey, as he was memorable in the citty. And therefore theſe particulars conſidered, he denied to let him haue his deſire. Dobſon ſaid nothing, but ſhewed himſelfe well appeaſed, yet he intended to abridge his vncle as much of his pleaſure as he had done him of his. And at the very time his vncle was to ſet forward with his progreſſe, one of thoſe good fellowes, who had fauoured him in the breaking of the Orchard, was ſent for into Northumberland to his mother, who lay at the poynt of death, and deſired to ſpeake with him before ſhe paſſed this life. And hée both loath to take ſo great a iourney on foote, and not hauing a horſe of his owne, could not tell how (ſo preſently) to ſpéede himſelfe of one, as theſe his importunities and haſte required; he acquainted Dobſon with his want, and intreated him amongſt his friends, for that time, to further him, and he would pleaſure him as much, if ſo his arrand came in his way. Dobſon told him, that in the towne (vpon ſo ſhort warning) he could not procure him any, vnleſſe, quoth he, I might make bolde with my vnckles gelding, which if thou couldſt returne before to morrow morning, I could then ſupply thy neceſſity, and otherwiſe I ſhould diſappoint himſelfe, for he is to ride into the countrey, to take the ayre after his long ſickenes, and to feaſt it amongſt his friendes. O good Dobſon, ſaid his acquaintance, hazard alittle to pleaſure me, and in any thing thou ſhalt commaund me, though the execution therof ſhould ſtand with the expence of my blood and life, yet will I not refuſe to aduenture for thy life, fame, and reputation: for if my mother ſhould be departed before my comming, I ſhall be vtterly vndone, and great is the loſſe that may redound to me thereby. To morrow at night, at the vtmoſt, I will ſend him backe, and if ſo

long he will not deferre his iourney: He is not of ſuch ſlender acquaintaunce, neither ſo ill be
                     •
                  oued, but that he may haue choice amongſt his pariſhioners and neighbours.
               
                  Dobſon of all other things deteſting ingratitude, and not to ſeeme vnmindefull of pleaſures receiued, or careleſſe in requitall of good offices, willd him to prouide him ſelfe of furniture requiſite, and he promiſed to affoorde him a horſe foorthwith, conditionally that whenſoeuer thou bringeſt him backe, thou ſhalt leaue him ſomwhere in the pownd within three miles of the Citty, charging the Pinder to proclaime the next market day, that ſo my vnckle may come to heare of h
                     •
                  m againe: and will him alſo to take, not onely an ordinary fee, but alſo for his paſture for ſo many dayes as thou haſt him in trauell, and ſo if thou wilt ſtay a wéeke▪ I ſhall licence thee. His friend much, and heartily thanked him, proteſting neuer to faile in whatſoeuer he could, by any of his endeauours to do him benefit, and receiuing the gelding at the place appointed betwixt them, held on his iourney with a gladſome chéere for this fauour of his friend, and left ſir Thomas, eyther to borrow vpon his neighbours, or to ſtay at home, or like a ſtowt fellow to ſteppe vppon his ſtumpes. The ſame night after ſupper was ended, ſir Thomas willed Dobſon to warne his tenaunt that looked to his ſaide gelding, and ſuch other beaſts as he had grazing a mile diſtant from the towne, to take him into the ſtables that night, to the end hée might haue him in readineſſe to be gone betimes the next morning, for he purpoſed to dine tenne miles from the Citty. Dobſon went preſently and deliuered his meſſage, and ſent the fellowe to the fieldes, who ſought him all that night, and the next day, in euery paſture, field, and towne within fiue miles circuite, but could heare nothing of the horſe. Sir

                  Thomas wéening him as ready now as at other times, got him to bedde that night ſomewhat ſoone, to the end hée might be ſtirring more earely the next morrow: in which ſo ſoone as the day appéered, he aroſe and made himſelfe fitte for his iourney, he put on his holiday apparrell, his bootes and ſpurres, called for his breakefaſt, and neuer aſked for his horſe, vntill he had ordered all things in the houſe, deſiring his ſiſter friendly to entertaine all ſuch his neighbours and acquaintaunces as ſhould come to viſite her during his tarriance in the Country: charging Dobſon to be dilligent in the accompliſhment of all her commaundements, and to abſtaine from all kinde of diſorders till his returne, to giue good reſpect to all thinges about the houſe, and at his chamber in the Fratery: and ſo kiſſing his ſiſter for a farewell (after the maner of the Countrey) he willed Dobſon to bring him his horſe to the doores. Dobſon returning from the ſtables, came and tolde his vncle, that his man had not brought him as yet from the fieldes, as hée ſuppoſed, for vppon hookes were hanging his bridle and ſaddle, but he could ſée no horſe. Sir Thomas chafed at the fellow his tenaunt, and ſent Dobſon to his houſe to know the cauſe why he was not yet come. The wife tolde him that ſhe had not ſéene him ſince his being there, when hée without further delay went to fetch him: and becauſe hée came not home to his bed, I iudged my Maiſter had ſent him abroade for the diſpatch of ſome other of his buſineſſes, ſo that if hee be not with you, for my life I cannot certifie what is becom of him. Dobſon carried backe her anſwer; which anſwer ſir Thomas hearing, hée knew not what to imagine, but ſtrait hée imagined his horſe to be ſtolne, and ſo affirmd. O God forbid, ſaid Dobſon, my hope is, that he is onely ſtrayed forth into ſome of our neighbors grounds, or elſe is ſome where in the pownd. If ſo, ſaide his vncle, then

the fellow would haue got ſome notice of him before this time: and ſo perhappes, good vncle, he will be héere with him ſhortly. In which hope ſir Thomas kept on his boots all that day till night, when home came the fellow without the horſe, neyther could tell any newes of him. 
                     •
                  ir Thomas feared he had béene ſtolne, and for the very ſorrow thereof, he ſtayed his iourny for that time, and ſent his man to euery coaſt of the Countrey, to inquire after him: but all his labour was in vaine, vntill the returne of the party, to whome Dobſon had lent him, who obſeruing Dobſons preſcript, left him in the pownd, at Cheſter in the ſtréete, charging the Pindar to take his accuſtomed fées, and for a wéekes paſture more, when hée ſhould be ſent for by the owner. The Pindar very glad of ſo good a pledge, cauſed proclamation to be made in Dunholme the next morrow after that hee was left with him. Some one of his neighbors that was preſent thereat, gaue ſir Thomas to vnderſtand thereof, who by the deſcription knew him to be his. He ſent for him immediately, and gaue the Pindar his whole demaund with all his heart, reioycing to haue got his gelding againe; which he verily ſuppoſed had bin ſtolne.
            
            
               How Dobſon brewed Ale for his vncle. Chap. 8.
               
                  
                     DObſon yet hardly brooking his vncles diſcurteſie, and perceiuing him to be dayly, eſtraunged, hauing got the reines into his hands, did grow careleſie more liberally runne at large, and neuer tooke vppe with himſelfe, vntill hée had thruſt his

necke into the halter, when if his vncle had not ſtood his very good friend, he had bid his kinſefolkes al adew with his héeles, and had daunced his laſt meaſures vpon the gallowes: but fearing no ſuch matter as then, neither imagining to be ſo much néedfull of his kindneſſe, he ſpared not to play the foole with him, who afterward prooued his beſt friend: neither did he thinke himſelfe ſufficiently ſatiſfied with the abuſe he had already offered, but euer as he could catch an accurrence to doe him further griefe, he put to execution the ſame forthwith. His vncle to recompence his neighbours carefull reſpect of him in his ſickneſſe, inuited them to a Friday nights drinking, letting them to vnderſtand, that whereas they were ſory for his late miſfortune, as wel appeared by their care and paines taken about him during the time of his infirmity, which their gratitude and kindneſſe commixt with compaſſion, though he were not of power in equall meaſure able to ſatiſfie, & according to their well deſeruings, yet his willingneſſe ſhould neuer be wanting, to affoord ſo much as his eſtate and abilitie permitted: and therefore praying them to pardon his inſufficiencie, and to accept of his good will, he wiſhed he might be ſo bold as to intreat them to take a cup of Ale with him, and an apple, the Friday at night following, which he promiſed ſhould be of the beſt to be had in Dunholme. They excuſing their negligence, told him they were aſhamed that they did no better ſtéed him, when his neceſſitie ſo required, but they could do no more but ſorrow for their defect: and for ſuch troubleſome gueſts as they ſhould be, they told him that he néeded not to feare to want▪ He greatly contented with the gratefull acceptance of his ſimple offer, beſpoke his Hoſteſſe to ſend to his chamber halfe a dozen gallons of her beſt Ale, which ſhe did according to his appointment. He further commaunded his houſe-kéeper

to beſtow it in ſome ſafe place, where none might haue acceſſe to trouble it, vntill it were cléere and fined: which ſhe did (as ſhe imagined) yet Dobſon had a ſhift to deceiue her, aſwell as to ſet his vncles geldings in the fold. So, vpon the Thurſday at afternoone before his vncles gueſts were to come, he and his fellow ſchollers hauing libertie to diſpend the day at their choyce, & were diſmiſſed of al ſchoole exerciſes, he willing to make them a banquet, carried ſuch as he ſpecially fauoured with him to the Vicarage, where preuenting his vncles gueſts, he made the moſt part of them drunke as Rats. When he had placed them all ſo néere to the houſe as hée thought conuenient, he came to his Aunt, and told her that Sir Thomas was come to the Church, to ſée if the Organs were in tune, for the next Sunday they were to be vſed: and becauſe he would not altogether rely on his owne iudgement therein, he had brought with him halfe a dozen of his familiars, to help to reforme them, if néed ſo required, to whom, in regard of their paines, he had promiſed a cup of his Ale; and therefore willed her to tappe it, and to ſend him a Jacke thereof to the Church. She beléeuing this his tale to be true, gaue to him the key of the houſe where it was kept, deſiring him to broach it, in reſpect her ſight was ſo imperfect, that ſhe could not well diſcerne what ſhe did. Dobſon glad of his commiſſion, extended this authority, plaid the bountifull Butler, and did draw forth into tankards (which he of purpoſe had prouided) more then halfe his vncles Ale: yet becauſe he was loath that his vncle ſhould want of his meaſure, he filled vp the barrell with water which he found there ſtanding in pailes: and ſurrendring againe the key to the cuſtody of his Aunt, away he went (as ſhe wéened) to the Church to his Vncle, but in very déed he returned to his companions, where he had left them ſhooting in the

meadowes, who laughing at Dobſons deceiuing of his Aunt, drunke healthes ſoliberally one to another, as not one of them was able to goe home, but as Dobſon conducted them. The next night enſuing the gueſts came according to their promiſe, whom Sir Thomas welcomed with many faire and curteous ſpeeches, much thanking them, that they would vouchſafe to aſſemble to his poore lodging, and accept of ſuch a poore pittance as he had prouided, which he ſaid was a roaſted apple and a cup of Ale, which I dare pawne you my word is the beſt in Dunholme: and while the apples were at the fire, he willed his houſe-kéeper to fill a glaſſe thereof, that they might taſte it, and ſuſpend their verdicts how they liked it: his very conceit ſerued to make it good enough in his iudgement, ſo that when he taſted, he could not perceiue the commixture: but commending it for ſingular good, gaue it to him who ſate next, willing him to drinke well thereof, for he was very welcome to it: but he eſpying it pale in the glaſſe, feared that it was not ſuch as Sir Thomas commended it to be, yet notwithſtanding he kiked the cup, and reached to another, and ſo it went through them all, and yet the better halfe remained vndrunke.
               Sir. Thomas maruelling to ſee them leaue ſo little in the glaſſe, aſked them how they liked the ſame, for it ſéemeth by your drinking that it is not ſuch as you looked for: indéed (ſaid they) it might be made good againe, with brewing ouer againe, but we haue drunke much better in our liues than it is now, and ſeldome worſe. Wherevpon ſir Thomas halfe aſhamed ſo raſhly to haue praiſed it, and in great chaife againſt his Hoſteſſe, tooke the glaſſe and taſted it againe, an
                     •
                   drinking the remainder hée ſwore, that it was more than halfe water, and aſked his houſe-keeper how it came to paſſe▪ what (ſaith ſhée) doe you miſlike it now, and could finde no ſault with it yesterday?

was it good then, and naughty to night? Yeſterday (ſaid he) I neuer taſted it before this preſent, and how could I then giue iudgement of the good or bad qualitie thereof? No, (ſaid his ſiſter) did not you ſend our nephew to me yeſterday, with commandement to broach it, and to ſend you a tankard of the ſame to the Church? neuer I (quoth ſir Thomas) in all my life: why then (ſaid ſhe) he hath deceiued me, for ſuch meſſage hee brought, and I truſted him and let him to take what he would; for he aſſured me, that it was for your ſelfe, and your friends with you. Dobſon hearing this ſedule of his Aunt, ſtole foorth into a place where the Hens ſit vpon a fleake, whither he aſcended, pulling vp the ladder after him, that no man could come to him but by his permiſſion: his Vncle vpon this relation of his ſiſter, called and ſought for Dobſon in euery corner of the houſe, but hée would make no anſwere; vntill at the laſt ſir Thomas hearing a ruſhing vpon the fleake, eſpied his cock ſitting amongſt his hens: and after he had thundred foorth ſome threatning ſpeeches, he commanded him to diſcend, not ſo (good Vncle, ſaith he) vnleſſe you will firſt ſweare that you will pardon me, I telling you the truth of the matter, and otherwiſe, rather than I will ſuſtaine your rigorous puniſhment, I will throw my ſelfe head-long from hence, and will take it vpon my death, that the very feare of your ſeueritie hath vrged me ſo to doe, anſwere you the lawe as you can. The neighbors intreated ſir Thomas to remit to him that fault, and to be pacified, offering all to paſſe their words, that he ſhould neuer more in ſuch ſort offend him: he afraid that the violent fellow would do himſelfe ſome iniurie, at their important ſuites pardoned him, vpon condition that he would bewray the truth, which hée did, and came downe from the fleake, and to make his Vncle, ſome kind of ſatiſfaction, he went into the towne

and fetcht ſome better Ale, wherewithall hée intended to entertaine his honeſt friendes, and louing neighbours all.
            
            
               How Dobſon furniſhed himſelfe of a ſute of apparrell: and how he vſed his Schoole-fellow. Chap. 9.
               
                  SIR Thomas, notwithſtanding that he pardoned his nephew at the inſtance of his neighbours, and accepted of his ſubmiſſion for the time, yet ſeeing him to grow ſo abſolute in knauery, he purpoſed to hold his noſe to the grindſtone, and to keepe him at hard meat, he ſpared his purſe, and made him go thinly apparelled, and ſcarcely ſometimes did he allow whole cloathes, but forced him to weare his old rags for want of newe, till they hung in totters about his taile. But Dobſon to remedie this neceſſity, enrolled his vncles name in the Drapers booke, for a ſute and a cloake, which his vncle was conſtrained to diſcharge for his credite ſake. But to preuent him of that meane, he went thorow the Citty amongeſt all the Clothiers and Millioners, warning them no further to credite him, vnleſſe hee bought it with ready mony, the which he ſhall alwayes haue, if he be ſent from me: and whoſoeuer ſhall let him haue any vpon credite, muſt be glad to ſtand to his owne perill, for ile not be anſwerable for any halfe-penny thereof from hence forward.

The marchants thereupon would no more regiſter Dobſons name, not ſo much as for a paire of garters, which putte him (poore man) into great diſcontent, and what ſhift to make for garments, when theſe were gone, hée could not deuiſe: to aſke for any of his vncle hée dared not, and hée was debarred of his former proiect, by the which he ſuppoſed to haue euer, as he had néeded, to ſupply that indigence. He muſt then take ſome other courſe, and for once hée fell to ſtealing, taking away a ſong made by one of his fellowes, which for the exquiſite muſicke therein ſhewed, was highly commended of the whole Quéere. This he purloyning carried into the Country to his vncle Pharoes houle, who had diuers ſonnes and daughters that could ſing, of whoſe knowledge in that Arre his vncle was not a little prowd. Dobſon therefore to applaud his vncles humor, preſented him this Song, telling him how himſelfe had made the ſame: and he, becauſe it was well liked of, and allowed for good conſort, that hée thought it no where better beſtowed than vppon my cooſins your daughters. Maiſter Pharoe thanked him, and promiſed to recompence his good will: But firſt hée called his daughters to ſing it ouer, who with their ſwéete and tuneable voyces much mooued their fathers affection; themſelues alſo were ſo much in loue with the deſcant, that they requeſted onely to haue it ſet in their bookes: but Dobſon more liberall then they looked to haue found him, fréely beſtowed it among them, with this applauſe; Good cooſins, if this be pleaſing vnto you, I will affoord you héereafter more plenty of better ſtuffe, this is but the ſimple inuention of my owne rude braine, and not worthy of halfe this commendation: but ſuch as it is, yours it is with all my heart, and I thinke my ſelfe in your debt for your kinde acceptance thereof. His couſins thanked him againe, and beſéeched their father to

be bounteous towards him. He to ſatiſfie Dobſons exſpectation, and to gratifie his daughters requeſt, clothed his kinſman Dobſon in a new ſuite, whereof hée being heartily glad, didde profeſſe to his vncle and cooſins to be alwayes at their commaund and ſeruice, and ſo returned to Dunholme in that caſe, where hée kept as much ſwaggering as before.
               His vncle ſir Thomas maruelled whence he had ſuch a gallant ſute, and who had beene ſo liberall toward him, deſired to be informed. It is no matter, ſaide Dobſon, (good vncle) ſince that now I haue them, you may coniecture that I haue compaſſed them by my wittes, and if you thinke I haue not got them by begging, imagine they are ſtolne. Sir Thomas thinking it fitte no further to vrge him, ſuffered the matter to paſſe without anie further queſtion. At the ſame inſtant, a yoong Gentleman, a fellow ſcholler of his, had a new ſuite of the ſame colour and cloth, and hée was of equall make and ſtature with Dobſon, and their backes being towardes the beholders, it was a difficulty to diſcerne the one from the other, wherewith Dobſon was not well content to be chalenged ſo often for his fellow. To giue the people ſome ſpeciall note therefore how to diſtinguiſh them, he vſed this meane: In the ſchoole was a great flintie ſtone, vpon which in the winter time this yong Gentleman was accuſtomed to ſit before the fire: this ſtone one morning while the other was exerciſ
                     •
                  d in writing, and gaue no reſpect vnto what was pr
                     •
                  aiſed, Dobſon cauſed to be made extreame hote, and pretending to haue ſome matter of importaunce to impart to the Gentleman, he called him to the fire, and made the ſtone ready for him to ſit vpon, who neither fearing nor thinking of any kind of harme, ſatchimſelfe downe as he was woont, to diſcourſe with Dobſon, who propounded a number of extrauagant

queſtions where with to occupy his minde, and whereby to expel from his memorie, all occaſions or motiues of riſing from his ſeate, till anone the boy felt an extraordinary heate in his buttockes, yet he ſate ſtill, while ſtrait he perceiued that they were ready to broyle, at the which he ſtarted vppe halfe aſtoniſhed, and putting his hand behinde him, to féele if his breeches were not fired: and hée perceiued the greateſt parte of them to be burned forth, and a great open to paſſe thorow cloth, linings, and ſhert, euen to his naked ſkinne. The Boy quaked and trembled, being ſore amazd with the chance, as not conceiuing how it came to paſſe. Dobſon and his complices ſported themſelues at the boyes miſ hap, and the moſt of Dobſons familiars in the Towne, to whome notice was giuen thereof, made themſelues merry with the boy as hée paſſed before them in the ſtréetes, from the Schoole to his Innes, and he was glad to get a patch ſet vppon the broken place, by which, euer after, hée was knowne from Dobſon.
               
            
            
               ¶ How Dobſon tooke vpon him a Gentlemans eſtate: and how he cauſed the Ale-wife of Wittan to come before the Commiſſarie. Chap. 10
               
                  IT hath bin a cuſtome of olde, and is yet to this day in the Schooles of Dunholme, for thrée Schollers euery Satterday to be marſhaled forth to the woods in the countrey, to prouide birchen roddes for the correction of the diſordred and negligent:

and obſeruing a certaine order therein, it paſſed quite thorow the whole number of ſchollers euery halfe yeare. Once Dobſon in the winter ſeaſon, when the weather in thoſe parts is commonly ſtormy, and the ayre piercing, had alwayes a ſhift to thruſt another forward, and to kéepe himſelfe at home: mary in ſummer, when it ſéemed a healthfull recreation, it pleaſed him to kéepe his owne turne and others too, in liew of the paines they had taken for him in the colder time of the yeare. Concerning then a deſire to notifie his fame among the countrey men and ſwaines of the villages, one time when he was appointed in the hinder end of the month of Maie, to accompany Rakebaine and Talifere to the birch woods, he decréed with them to commit ſome famous ieaſt, for which to make himſelfe memorable. In Witton Iilbert, for thither they were to go for ſuch rubbiſh as they wanted, and conferring with them of the matter vpon the Friday at night before, they concluded, that he ſhould take vpon him the ſtate of a Gentleman, and that they two ſhould attend him as ſeruitors, and reſpectiuely reuerence him as their Maiſter: determining further, that they would banquet with ſome good wife for a meſſe of creame before they returned; & ſo examining their purſes, their whole ſtock amounted but to onely thrée pence, which they thought was a great deale too little, and far inſufficient to diſcharge their ſhot, they hauing an intention to ſpend royally. But Dobſon to animate them forward, willed them to referre the matter to himſelfe, and they ſhould ſée that he would take ſuch courſe, as that he would make it ſerue wel enough with the helpe of his countenance: Therefore Iames (ſaith he) thou muſt affoord me thy beſt ſute of apparell, thy cloke and rapyer, to attire me withall, that there may be ſome difference, and that the people may more eaſily conceiue my gentilitie:

and for you, I will borrow two liueries, and two ſwords, and ſée that you play the ſeruingmen in forme. When I call or ſpeake to you, forget not to ſtand with your heads vncouered: or if I ſtand to piſſe, you muſt alſo ſtand bare at my backe, after our Engliſh faſhion. You muſt worſhip, and good worſhippe me at euery word: to wit, you muſt take occaſion to informe me of ſomewhat to be done, and then you muſt frame your ſpéech in this forme: And it pleaſe your good Worſhip, your Worſhips Father willed me to put you in mind of a ſpéedy returne, deſiring your Worſhippe to remember his buſineſſe, &c. And if any aſke you what I am, you ſhall aunſwere, that I am ſonne to Maiſter Chauncellor of Dunholme. And be careful, that in no phraſe of ſpéech, geſture or cariage, that you ſhew your ſelues familiar, but attend me with all ſubmiſſion and reuerence. And you executing theſe inſtructions, ſhall ſée that I will procure vs indeleable reſpect amongſt the vulgar ſort, and all the townes and villages néere about, ſhal haue cauſe to ſpeake of Maſter Chauncellors ſonne and his men. And hauing thus receiued their leſſon, away they go the Saturday morning toward Witton Iilbert, Dobſon in Rakebaines apparel, cloke and rapyer, and his companions in ſuch old liueries as he had borrowed amongſt the Prebends, with two il fauoured ſwords girt to their ſides. As they paſſed along they were met by many multitudes of market folkes, whom that Dobſon might ſtirre them to conceiue of his gentilitie, tooke many occaſions to talke with his men: ſometimes he would ſtand ſtill, other ſometimes he would hold forth right, at other times alſo he would ſuddenly turne him about, at euery which occaſion they capped and knéeled in humble and debonaire maner: diuers ſimple people wondered who it ſhould be: ſome ſaid certainely he is ſonne to ſome great perſonage, and hath

béene brought vp in ciuill places, for in all our liues wée haue not ſeene a man ſo much reuerenced by his ſeruāts. Others beholding the cariage of his attendants, at their méeting of him, would alſo cap, knéele, and bid good morrow to his Worſhip: and this courſe of complements they continued from Dunholme, while they came to Witton, which by computation is foure miles. When hée came into the towne, hée aſked where he might haue ſame victuals ſor himſelfe and his men: An Alehouſe was preſently ſhewed vnto him, into which he entred, called to the goodwife to make a breakefaſt ready for him and his men: ſhée demaunded what it would pleaſe his good Worſhippe to haue prepared: He anſwered, that he would haue ſome new cakes, creame, butter, and ſuch other things as ſhe could affoord: all which ſhe ſet vpon the table before him incontinent. Maſter Chauncellors ſonne and his men fell to their victuals afreſh, their ſtomackes were pretty good, and they quickly made rid of this prouiſion, and aſked their Hoſteſſe what they had to pay: two pence a man (ſaid ſhe) and your Worſhip is hartily welcome. Alas good woman, that is but ſixe pence in the whole: No more, and it pleaſe your Worſhip will I haue at this time for ſo ſlender fare (ſaid the good wife:) Why then (ſaid Maſter Dobſon) turne the cloath againe, we will make her amends: ſo hée called for more Ale, which ſhe brought of a nut browne colour, as good as needed to be drunke, with great ſtore of new cakes, creame, and cuſtard, chéeſe alſo with apples and nuts, ſhe placed on the table againe: of all which they tooke ſo much as they thought good, and willed her to remoue the reſidue: then they deſired againe to know their ſhot for altogether: ſhe told them, that for the whole they muſt pay twenty pence. What, ſaid Maſter Dobſon, (hauing but thrée pence to defray all) was it now but ſixe

pence, and wilt thou make this laſt, being much worſe, trebble the firſt? Nay gogs heart, I will teach thée a tricke for that. Good ſir (ſaid the woman) I cannot well haue leſſe, if I ſhould be a ſauer by you, and I truſt you do not wiſh my loſſe. No (ſaith Maiſter Dobſen) neither yet ſhalt thou make a foole of me and ſo couſin mée. But I pray tell me one thing, haue you a licence to keepe an alehouſe? Yea ſir that I haue, and vnder maſter chauncellours owne hand and ſeale: Why and he is my father, ſaide M. Dobſon: but ſéeing thou haſt no better a conſcience than thus to extort men, I will haue it diſallowed, and therefore I doe charge thée, as thou wilt anſwer the contrary, at thy perill, that vppon Friday next thou make thy apparance before my father in the Chauncery, where I will ſée how thou canſt anſwer this irreligious dealing, and alſo haue thy licence ſurueyed, that if there can be any aduantage at all taken thereat, I will haue it defaced, and thy ſelfe puniſhed, as thou dooſt deſerue. The poore woman ſtarued with feare vppon this hard ſentence pronounced, fell proſtrate at his feete, beſéeching him to pardon her, for that ſhee had not vſed him as his worſhipfull calling required: but the fault was in her ignorance of his perſon and woorth. She alſo prayed him to be fauourable vnto her, and to take compaſſion of her miſerable eſtate, for ſhee was mother of fiue ſmall children, and had not where with all for to maintaine them, beſides that poore trade, and her huſbandes handy labour, and for that ſhotte ſhée was content with all her very heart to remitte it, and that hée ſhould commaund, not onely then, but at all other times, whatſoeuer was within her poore houſe that in any reſpect might doe him pleaſure. Well (ſaicty hée) I ſcorne to offer iniurie, to either thée, or to any of my inferiours: but, as I will not harme them, ſo they ſhall

not abuſe me. And as for the ſhot I will defray it euerie farthing: but faile not thou to come before my father, as I haue preſcribed, when I will haue you better inſtructed what appertaineth to your trade, than I coniecture you doe vnderſtand. And ſo goe fill your ſhotte pot, and you ſhall haue your money. The goodwife quaking euery bone, went to her caller for more ale, but in the meane time Maiſter Chauncellours ſonne leauing onely thrée pence vpon the Table for the whole diſcharge, conueyed himſelfe and his men forth of the houſe, and cloſely ſtole into the woods, where euery man loading himſelfe with burch, in the éeuening they returned to the citty by a ſecret and priuate paſſage. The goodwife, after they were gone, was forced to content her ſelfe with what they had left, not knowing how to recouer the reſidue: and carefull ſhée remained all the wéeke after, for her appearaunce to be made before Maſter Chauncellour. She related to her huſband at night what accident ſhée had that morning, his feare was double hers, and hée chafed and chid her apace, and had wel-nie beaten her, for demaunding ſo much, and for that ſhée had no better reſpected him: for now (ſaith he) haſt thou, through thy couetouſneſſe, vndone vs all for euer: for if thy licence be taken from thée, as by likelihoode it muſt néedes, we may all goe begge, and ſo daunted was hée with the newes that hée could not tell how to aduiſe her. But going to the Church the morrow after, he aſked Maiſter Vicar and all his neighbours counſell, deſiring them to direct him what was beſt to be done in this matter. They, to ſée their neighbour in ſuch a difficulty, laide their heades together, and concluded, that his wife ſhould goe and let her licence be ſéene, and that ſhée alſo ſhould make reherſall of all that which had paſſed betwixt her and them, omitting no circumſtance. And wée (ſaide they) will all

ioyne in petition to Maiſter Chauncellour, to permit her to praſtiſe her trade, which petition Maiſter Vicar preſently framed, and they confirmed, by ſubſcribing thereto their names, and deliuering it to their neighbor. And that they might bring into ſome comfort whome they ſée cleane out of heart with the feares he conceiued héerevpon, they chéered him with many faire ſpéeches, promiſing, that he ſhould not fall, if their helps could ſuſtaine or proppe him vppe. After dinner, the better to incorage him, they all came to drinke at his houſe, and to repaire the domage which ſhe his wife had receiued by Maiſter Dobſon. And ſo plentifully maiſter Vicar, and the goodfellowes of his pariſh tooke their cuppes, that not a man amongeſt them, but that hee receiued a wound in his head, and for Maiſter vicar, he was not able for that night reade his Seruice, but perceiuing himſelfe hurt, he requeſted his hoſteſſe to fit him of a bed, for that night, whereunto ſhée moſt willingly aſſented. But this reſted vntill friday morning, when vp aroſe the Ale-wife betimes, put on her faireſt ſmocke, peticoate of good broad red, her gowne of grey, faced with buckeram, her ſquare thrumd hatte, and before her ſhée hung a cleane white apron, and putting her petition into the boxe, with her licence, ſhée takes her way to Dunholme, there to attend her calling in, to anſwer before Maiſter Chauncellour, but there ſhée ſtayed all the fore noone, exſpecting when Maiſter Dobſon would bring her to hir appearance, much maruelling that no man did acknowledge her, neyther queſtion with her as concerning her buſineſſe. Shée had ſpeciall care to eſpie Maiſter Chauncellours ſonne in the throng, and not able to fixe her eies vpon him, ſhe ſuppoſed that he was not accuſtomed to come abroad ſo early, albeit ſhe attended there before the Chauncery office doore, from halfe an houre paſt ſeauen in the morning,

vntill almoſt twelue, when the Court roſe and went to dinner: ſhée earneſtly deſired to haue a diſpatch, but how to effect her deſire ſhe could not deuiſe, for ſhe was vnknowne to all, and they in like ſort were all ſtraungers to her, and Maiſter Dobſon had forgotten the ſtrict charge he impoſed vpon her the ſatterday afore-going, neyther ſought he to exhibite any Bill of Complaint againſt her. She ſéeing no perſon to reſpect her, albeit ſhée was in a laborinth of conceits, ſometimes of retiring, otherwhile of ſtaying til ſhée might ſée the vttermoſt: ſhe alſo thoght it conuenient to take a little meate in the Towne at a kinſmans houſe of hers there dwelling, to whome ſhe reuealed her whole caſe, and requeſted his counſell: Hée thought it fitte that ſhe ſhould attend alittle further, to ſee if ſhe were inquired after, which if you be not cooſin (ſaide he) I wil make meanes my ſelfe to Maiſter Chancellour that you may be diſpatched and ſo depart home. At one of the clocke when the Court was to ſit againe, he came along with her toward the Chauncery. Maiſter Dobſon ſitting in an olde fréeze gowne before the north gate of the Cathedrall, eſpied his Hoſteſſe, and remembring himſelfe, that it was friday, imagined, without further diſcourſe, the cauſe of her being there: and being aſhamed to preſent himſelfe into her ſight, he cloſely conueyed him ſelfe from her view, yet thought hee good to ride her once againe like a countrey iade, and thereupon he went to one of the Clarkes of the Chancery, and acquainted him with the whole matter, deſiring him to take ſome courſe for the ending of her buſineſſe, and to ſet her packing: for during her abode in the Towne, I ſhal be conſtrained (ſaide he) like the Fore, to kéepe my hole. The Clearke promiſed to order the matter wellenough, but he either forgetting himſelfe, or troubled with ſo much other buſineſſe, that he could not regarde

it, ſuffered her to ſtay vntill thrée of the clocke vncalled for. Whereat her cooſin, grieued with her attendaunce, boldly ſtept into the Chauncery, tolde Maiſter Chauncellour her caſe, and deſired his good worſhip, that foorth of his accuſtomed clemency he would let her come to her anſwer, that ſhée might know what ſhée were to truſt vnto. The Chauncellour hearing ſuch reportes to his ſonnes diſgrace, in publique court, was greatly offended therewith, and cauſed her to be brought in, and demaunded of her if ſhe would iuſtifie thoſe things, or not. Yea, quoth ſhe, I will be depoſed that all theſe reportes of my cooſin be moſt true, and in witneſſe thereof, héere are the handes and names of our Curate, and principall men of our pariſh. Well quoth Maſter Chauncollour, Thou naughty woman, I will haue thée made an example to all the world for ſlaundering my ſonne with ſo much vntrueth: for the very day before thou reporteſt this acte to be done, I ſent him to Yorke about important buſineſſe of mine owne, and the Churches, and as yet he is not returned, neither, if he had béene at home ſhouldeſt thou make me to beléeue that he would haue ſo much abuſed himſelfe. O good Maiſter Chauncelour (ſaid ſhe) for the pitty of almighty God, reade my teſtimoniall, and you ſhall know thereby, that I haue ſpoke nothing but the plaine trueth, which if it appeare not to be ſo, then ſpare no puniſhment. He, although hée reſted aſſured of his ſonnes innocencie, yet becauſe the ſimpleneſſe of the woman perſwaded him that ſhe could not contriue it, and alſo ſéeing her ſo earneſtly to inſiſt vppon the verification thereof, hée conceiued that ſome had done her iniury, and fathered the matter vpon his ſonne: he therfore tooke her petition, and read it openly, which contained thus much in effect.
               
                  Humbly beſéecheth your good worſhip, father Chancellor, you daily Orators, the Vicar and pariſhioners of Wittan Iilbert, in the behalfe of this poore woman, our common Hoſteſſe of the ſame Towne and Pariſh, that whereas, vpon the fiue and twentieth day of Maie inſtant, your worſhips ſonite and ſole heire, accompanied with two men onely, repaired to the houſe of our ſaide Hoſteſſe, and there calling for Ale, Cakes, Creame, Curds, Cuſtard, Chéeſe, Apples and Nuts, had all the ſame things afforded in plentifull manner by our ſaid Hoſteſſe: whereof although but thrée in number, and alſo pretending themſelues gentlemen, they ate ſo much as would haue ſufficed ſixe ſtal-worth men, as with vs are ſet to plowe and waine, and when our hoſteſſe did demaund of them (as right would ſhe ſhould) but a reaſonable recompenſe, and much leſſe than they had taken of hers, they quarrelled with her, and like cozoning fellowes (if not your worſhips ſonne and ſeruants) they théeuiſhly departed, leauing all vndiſcharged except thrée pence, which they ſhamefully left on the table behinde them, whilſt ſhe was gone to fill their ſhot-pot, hauing before threatned her to haue her licence diſallowed, and vpon this day inioyned her to make her appearance before your worſhip in this Court, and there to haue her licence ſurueied, which we beſéech you to confirme, and ratifie, for ſhe is the beſt Hoſteſſe that euer muſt be in Wittan Iilbert, and better Ale is no where brewed than ſhee doth make; for one pot thereof taken in the morning, keepeth the heart warme all the day after: In your great charitie therefore wee humbly petitioning you, as you are a worthy Chancellor, to tender all our caſes, and in regard thereof we will acquite and defray all that your ſonne is to her indebted for that dayes worke; Wée (I ſay) whoſe names are here vnder-ſet.

               The Chauncellor and Court laughed along time at the ſubiect of this petition, and vnderſtanding the poore wiues ſimplicity by ſome péeuiſh brain abuſed, ſurrendred to her againe her licence, which ſhée there had ſhewed, willing her fréely to practiſe her trade: and for ſhe had receiued wrong vnder the name of his ſonne, hée repayed her with a French crowne, willing her alſo to ſpeake well of the Chancellor and his friends, and aſſuring her that it was not his ſonne, but ſome cozoning companions who had vſed his ſonnes name, to abuſe her thereby, diſpatched her away. For which curteſie ſhe humbly thanked him on her knées, & hyed her home to acquaint her huſband and neighbours of her good ſucceſſe: for ioy whereof they were all drunke the Sunday enſuing.
            
            
               How Dobſon ſtole a gooſe and Roaſted her. Chap. II.
               
                  IN the ſuburbs of Dunholme, the Monkes of the Abbey had a certaine houſe of recreation, in the which euery moneth once, in the ſummer time, they were aſſembled to paſtime themſelues in the orchards walks and gardens, which they had there planted:

while their orders continued vndiſſolued: but when they were reformed and reduced to a Deane and Chapiter, they leaſed, and let forth all ſuch places to Gentlemen of the Countrey. This houſe called the Hall-yerds, they farmed to one Monſieur du Pome, a merchant of the citty, who for his houſe prouiſion had alwayes there a houſe of Poultry. Dobſon promiſed his fellowes a feaſt, albeit he was not alwayes the beſt prouided of money, ſo about the Michaelmaſſe, when gooſe fleſh commeth into requeſt, he made an arrand to the Hallyerds, where ſuch ſhift he made, as away he brought a gooſe without note or ſuſpition, he ſhrowded it cloſely vnder his gowne, and leſt that either he might be purſued, or the gander ſhould cry and ſo indanger him of apprehenſion, he refuſed the ſtréetes, and tooke his paſſage alongſt the riuer ſide to a bridge called Pons Laurentiſ, which directly carried him into the Abbey. But in the way (as it fortuned) he was met by the owner of the ſame, who for his pleaſure came walking by the ſame paſſage to the Hall yerds, to take accompt of his ſeruants labours, and to ſée his houſes and cattell. The merchant in their méeting eſpying a ſubſtanre of a white colour vnder his gowne, demaunded what hée had there: Nothing ſaid Dobſon, but my Surpleſſe, which I haue béene fetching from my Laundreſſe, for it is almoſt Euenſong time. That is well done (ſaid the merchant) and making no further queſtion with him, they ſundred, the one taking his courſe to his farme, and the other to the ſchoole, where hée left his gander vntill Euenſong was ended, when he conueyed him to his old hoaſt-houſe at the ſigne of the Bore, where they got him made fit for the broach. And vpon monday morning intending to performe his promiſed banquet, he prouided a broach, and all other things requiſite, and cauſed a fire to be built in a ſellar vnder the Schoole, he ſet his fellows

to worke, playing the maiſter Cooke himſelfe, he aſſigned euery one of thoſe whom he had acquainted with the matter to a ſeuerall office. The gooſe as ſhe beganne to roſte more ripely, ſauored ſo all ouer the ſchoole, that maſter Bromeley very ſenſibly perceiued the ſame, and demaunded what it ſhould be, or from when ce it came: no man durſt bewray the trueth, for feare of Dobſons indignation. But Maiſter Bromeley miſſing him and diuers others, inquired how they had beſtowed themſelues. Whereunto anſwer was made, that they were in the lower houſe. He ſuſpecting that they were about the acting of ſome roguery, whirred downe the ſtaires, wéening to haue trapped them, but he found a ſnecke before his ſnowt, the doores were ſo ſtrongly boulted againſt him, that there he might not come but by licence. Vſing then his authoritie, he knocked luſtily, and commaunded Dobſon to open the doores, for he would come in to ſée what they had to doe there. Oh no, quoth Dobſon, for Gods ſake come not héere ſir, for you are not able to indure the ſtinch of this place, it is ſo mighty, that it will hazard your ſtrangling: for this laſt night, in the raine which fel there are come downe ſuch a multitude of frogs and other vermine into this houſe, that no man is able to ſet foote vpon any ground for them: and therefore, leſt they ſhould be the cauſe of any infection in this houſe, if they ſhould continue vntill Summer, wée haue made a fire to burne them, whereof proceedes this terrible ſtinch which you taſte, and from which we pray you to abſent your ſelfe. Gods bleſſing haue thy heart, quoth maſter Bromeley, I pray thee leaue not one of them aliue, and when you haue finiſhed your worke, let me haue intelligence thereof: for vntill ſuch time as you haue diſpatcht, I will leaue the Schoole, and commit the performaunce of this buſines to thy care and prouidence, wherein Dobſon
                  
promiſed to be very vigilant and reſpectiue, gladde to haue ſo eaſily poſſeſſed his maſter with a falſe ſuggeſtion: and ſo, when the gooſe was roaſted to their contentment, they ate her all to the bones, Dobſon and his beſt eſtéemd friends: which being done, they ſent to aduertiſe their Maiſter, that hée might returne at his pleaſure, for they had cleared the coaſt of all theſe miſ-ſhapen monſters, and had perfumed the Schoole with burning of frankenſence.
            
            
               How Dobſon deuiſed a holiday, and indangered his fellowes a whipping. Chap. 12
               
                  
                     DObſon, at eightéene yeares of age, had ſo well profited in Muſike, and in the Latine tongue, that he was ſuppoſed fit for the Vniuerſity, whither his vnckle had intended to ſend him ſo ſoone as his voice changed. But he deſirous to haue his name notorious in the Schoole, and to giue his fellowes often cauſe to ſpeake of him after his departure, hée ſet down with himſelf to play one famous ieſt more among them. And hauing prepared their affections with this aforeſaid ſolempne banquet, he thought them ſo confident of his good meaning, that they would neuer apprehend any ſiniſter conceit of his actions. One morning therefore about Midſummer after the ordinary prayers ſung in the Cathedral, they were marching toward the ſchoole as at other times. Dobſon hauing fore▪ thought his purpoſe, aſked them what they intended to doe, what other

ſhoulde we doe but goe to the Schoole? To the Schoole, (quoth Dobſon) and it a holiday? that were ſporte for a Tayler: I beleeue you cannot make me ſuch a foole. And why aunſwered they, we haue heard of no ſuch feſtiual, and if it be any, tis more than we doe know. Why that may very well be ſo: but I dare warrant you, that it is holiday, and thereof I am moſt certaine, for otherwiſe Batte Midforths ſhoppe would haue beene open, as vpon other working daies it is wont to be: or neuer ſince my comming to the towne haue I ſéene it ſhut, but vpon Sundayes and principall feaſts, ſo that I am well perſwaded, that it is ſome ſpeciall ſolemmtie this day▪ neyther is it to be doubted, but that it hath beene proclaymed in the Churches, or at leaſt in the pariſh of Sainct Nicholas, albeit wee haue not heard thereof, and that he knoweth welenough: for elſe (without all queſtion) his ſhoppe had not beene ſhutte in more this day than yeſterday. This Batte Midforth was of the Gentle Craft of Tranſlators, and cobling of bootes and ſhooes he won his liuelihoode: euery morning was hée accuſtomed to open his ſhoppe betimes, ſinging like the Nightingale, and working apace, if, as Dobſon ſaide, it were not holiday, whereof he neuer violated or brake any one, but obſerued them all, very deuoutly frequenting the church and ſermons, at the leaſt two times vppon euery ſuch day.
               This morning as it fortuned, he was gone into the Countrey, he and his wife, to viſit his wiues mother, who laboured of a quotidian feuer, and fearing death, had ſent for them to be at the making of her laſt will and teſtament, as alſo to ſee her interred according to her eſtate and deſire. Dobſon then finding his ſhop windows ſhut vp, vrged it for a certaine teſtimonie to proue thereby a holyday, knowing that a more forcible inſtance

could not haue béene by him aleadged, than that whereof themſelues could all be teſtificants: and thereby he ſo ſtaggered their vnderſtandings, that they could not reſolue what to do. Gladly they would haue apprehended the occaſion of a dayes libertie, if they could haue deuiſed how to haue ſatiſfied their Maiſter of this, they knew not what ſolemne Feaſt day, but becauſe they could not conceiue how that might be inculcate, they paſſed on ſtill toward the ſchoole. Dobſon ſéeing them ſo forward, turned his backe, and bid God ſpéed them well: for as for me you ſhall goe alone, let no man truſt me euer while I liue, if I come within the ſchoole doores this day. They perceiuing him to ſéeme offended, told him, that they were as willing as he to accept of the time, if they could be excuſed at their Maſters hands. Leaue the diſpatch of that matter to me (quoth Dobſon) I will be aduocate for vs all, if you will ioyne with me this day, and conuent ſome good fellows at the Moorehouſe, where I haue appointed a breakefaſt, and a match of ſhooting, I will diſcharge you of all blame at our Maiſters hands, and thereof be you not afraid. Vpon which condition they al agréed t'attend him, which way ſoeuer it liked him to go. Well then (ſ
                     •
                  id he) fet your bowes, and walke toward the Bellowes mede: if I be not there before you, fa
                     •
                  l to ſhoot till my comming. In the meane time I will attend at the Schoole doore till our Maſters repaire, to whom I will ſhew how it is holyday: which done, I will not be long abſent from you, when we will go to the place appointed. Euery man allowing this courſe, fet his artillerie, and marched forth of the Abbey, with whom Dobſon went along, euen vntill they came almoſt to the place where he had aſſigned them to ſtay: then he returned to informe Maiſter Bromley as he promiſed of the feſtiuall: and making as much haſt as poſſibly he could, to preuent

his Maiſters comming, he tooke his ſeate cloſe at the Schoole doore, lapped in his gowne as he had been a cold. About the houre of eight of the clocke Maiſter Bromeley came and bid him good morrow, demaunding the cauſe of his ſitting there alone, and why he was not in the Schoole? Sir (ſaith he) the doore is ſhut, and I cannot tel how to enter, and all the reſidue of my fellowes be gone abroad to ſhoot, and would haue had me to accompanie them, affirming it to be holyday: But becauſe I could not tell what feſtiuall it ſhould be, neither haue heard that it was ſo publiſhed in any Church of the Towne, I dared not preſume to goe with them: partly, bicauſe I feared your offence, and partly, becauſe I could not imagine what holyday it ſhould be, for I eſpy all ſorts of Citizens and Artizans in their ſhops, as vpon working dayes: yet notwithſtanding all the reaſons I produced to ouerthrow ſuch their opinion, I could not perſwade them to ſtay till your pleaſure therein were knowne. But laughing at my timors, away they went globating to the fields. Maiſter Bromeley firſt examining the day and time of the yeare, leſt haply it might be ſome Apoſtles or other Saints day: that either by the preſcript of the Church, or the general cuſtome of the Country, was to be kept holy, could not call to his remembrance that it was any ſuch: and therefore he gaue Dobſon in commiſſion, to goe and commaund them all to repaire to the Schoole: with which his charge he departed, leauing his Maiſter to walke his ſtations before the portall. When he came to the place where they were earneſtly ſhooting: Gentles (ſaid he) I am come from our Maiſter, to intreat your helps a little. There are diuers Gentlemen of good ſort yeſternight come from London, who are trauelling toward Barwicke: and they haue ſought forth our Maiſter this morning betimes, deſiring to ſée our Schoole,

and the number of ſchollers, requeſting alſo that wée may giue them a ſong: and haue brought themſelues diuerſitie of deſcant, lately ſet forth by Maiſter Bird Doctor of our Arte. Our Maiſter did know it to be holyday before I told him, and therefore was much ſolicited how to get vs aſſembled together becauſe of the ſame. That he might gratifie the ſtraungers deſires, and for ioy that I was ſo nigh at hand, he hath promiſed vs another day of recreation, when we ſhall think fit to call for the ſame. They taking all his ſentences for Oracles, without further delay, in hope of their Maiſters future fauour, and ſome reward of the Gentlemen, hurled homeward in heapes, beſtowing their artillery to the cuſtodie of their acquaintances in the way, ſtriuing who ſhould come firſt home. But when they came within the Cathedral, and did ſee their maſter kéeping his ward alone, their copies changde, and wiſhed with all their hearts they had béene away: but Dobſon ſéeing them to be ſo daunted, incouraged them to goe forward, implying to them, that the ſtrangers were but gone to take a viewe of ſome of the ancient monuments in the Chancellour ſhrine of S. Cuthbert till their comming: and to releaſe them of all feares, himſelfe ſtept formoſt into the Schoole. When euery man was ſeated in his place, diſputing what would be the iſſue of their calling home, M. Bromeley bolting the doore ſo faſt that none could eſcape forth, examined the cauſe, why they had neglected the ſchoole without his licence, and did not rather follow Dobſons aduiſe, which was, to haue acquainted him firſt, that it was a ſolemnitie of ſome Saint, either kept of cuſtome, or commanded, which if by their collections they could haue made plaine, then he would not haue detained them againſt any auntient and approoued cuſtome of the Schoole. They by theſe propoſitions ſeating how the caſe ſtood, had no

better excuſe to cleare themſelues, then to blame the blame-worthy, and ſo at large related, how by him they were induced thereunto, ſtanding all to affirme it in his face, and their teſtimonies ſo ſtrongly charging him, could not deſcerne any fault in them worthy of chaſtiſment, but turned all his anger vpon this pregnant deuiſer, who well merited the whip, and was commanded to prepare his bréech for the ſtrappado. But when hée perceiued that no reply of his againſt their aſſertion could be taken, neither any entreatie or promiſe of amendement procure his pardon, he ſkipped into an olde Jakes in the Schoole, whereinto they vſed to throwe all their filthy duſt and ſwéepings, proteſting that foorth of that place he would neuer come, vnleſſe that his maſter would ſolemnly ſweare to remit and forgiue vnto him all offences paſt: and if that any diſaſter ſhall ouer-take me in this place (ſaith he) I will take it vpon my death, that the feare I conceiue of your barbarous vſage of me is the cauſe thereof, anſwere it as you can; you will finde that I haue parents will ſeeke for no leſſe ſatiſfaction then the lawe will allow them. M. Bromeley doubtfull that he had béen madde or lunaticke by his deſperate behauior, intreated him to come foorth, ſwearing vpon the Bible, that he would not onely releaſe him, but pardon all the reſt: vpon which his depoſition made, Dobſon by the helpe of a rope which was caſt downe vnto him▪ aſcended foorth of the pit, and was reconciled to his Ma. and ſchoole fellowes. After which time he deſiſted from further practizing againſt them, béeing ſent by his Vncle within a wéekes ſpace to the Vuiuerſitie of Cambridge.
            
            
               
               Of Dobſons intertainment at Cambridge: and of his diſputes there kept in the publike Schooles. Chap. 13.
               
                  SIr Thomas béeing let to vnderſtand, by the Maiſters of the Schooles, that his nephew was fit for the Vniuerſitie, acquainted M. Deane therewith, requeſting his good help and furtherance toward his placing in ſome good eſtate, whereby hée might be the rather mooued to continue and ſet himſelfe to his ſtudies with more facilitie, ſuch impediments being cut off as a number, who forced to attend, in reſpect of their lacke of maintenance, can hardly allot themſelues any time to their bookes. And therefore he prayed Maiſter Deane to commend him by Letters to ſuch his friends as his worſhip did know could ſteade him for his promoting to a ſchollerſhip, when the time of Election ſhould come, that he might haue that helpe, together with the money which he had reſerued of his Choriſiers ſtipend for his exhibition, which there hee made accompt of to maiſter Deane, that he entirely ſaued and kept it according as his worſhippe had commaunded for that end and purpoſe. Maiſter Deane, for ſir Thomas his ſake, whome he loued more than any Canoniſt in the church, was willing to doe whatſoeuer hée deſired, is farre forth, as his Letters and credite in thoſe places would extend: and at the time of his ſetting forward, foorth of his owne coffers hée gaue vnto him as towards his viaticum, tenne markes in liberalitie, and fiue other

to beſtow vpon his ſtudy: he writ alſo in friendly manner to the Maiſter and Fellowes of Chriſts Colledge, intreating them to entertaine him as his poore ſcholler, and that when a Scholerſhip came into their gift, which by the ſtatutes of their houſe they might diſpoſe of, hée then deſired that (no miſdemeanor of him to the contrary them inhibiting) to admit him thereunto, and himſelfe would take it as a fauour extended vnto him, neyther would be negligent in the requitall of ſuch a courteſie. And before he ſealed, he read them vnto ſir Thomas, who humbly thanked him for theſe vndeſerued fauors, promiſing, that for ſuch his worſhipful goodneſſe and reſpect, he and his nephew ſhuld remaine his daily beadſmen vntil death. And receiuing the money and letters of Maiſter Deane, he tooke his leaue, and the next daie hée diſpatched away Dobſon, with diuers others that intended the ſame courſe, waging a carrier to conduct and guide them thither, where hée found as good welcome as could be wiſhed for, in regarde of maiſter Deanes Letters, the effect of which euery man deſired to accompliſh, and the Maiſter himſelfe aſſigned him a Tutor, and carefully ſupplyed all his wants, aſſuming him into a Schollers place, by the aſſent of all the fellows within three wéekes of his comming thither, although that the time of Election was not vntill Michaelmaſſe after, a full halfe yéere from the time of his inſtalling. Hée carried himſelfe very reſpectiuely til hée had perfitly learned all the cuſtomes and faſhions of the Vniuerſitie, and ſo diligently ſetled himſelfe to his booke, as by the eſtimate of all hée was accompted the beſt Student in the Houſe, and ſo exact he became in the interpreters of the Logicke and Philoſophy, that there was not one of his claſſe able to equall him in diſpute, or canuaſſe an Argument with ſuch dexteritie. In this courſe did he kéepe himſelfe

thrée yeares, vntill he was called to the publike ſchooles, to hold his diſputes in open audience of the Vniuerſitie, when hée ruſhed againe into his olde humours. And the firſt that oppoſed himſelfe to Dobſon in the Schooles was a Welchman: the firſt. of whoſe queſtions was:
                  
                     An aër ſit ſubstantia corporea:
                  
                  
                  Dobſon anſwered:
                  If Wallus may be Gallus, aër ſit ſubstantia corporea.
                  
               
               The Welchman cauelled againe, vntill by the Moderator they were inioyned to goe to the queſtion, and to diſpute it ſyllogiſticè. The opponent vrging an argument very captiouſly, was taken at the rebound, and beaten with his owne Racket. Dobſon eſcrying the Eleuch, ſhewed him the falſitie of the Sophiſme, and made him cléere with a diſtinction: and ſo, that ſtaffe being broken, he tooke a ſtronger by the end (as he imagined) but héerein Dobſon ſo abaſed him, that the Welchman deſcended the Pulpit, and would faine haue pulled him by the eares, if by the audience hée had not beene interrupted, who perſwaded him the contrary, wherein (no doubt) they were greatly his hinderance, for if his charitie had béene to haue lent, I coniecture hée ſhould haue had his owne repaied with vſurio. Dobſon prepared to haue reſtored him the curteſie of the towne, and bearing a gentlemanly minde, hee reſolued to haue beſtowed two for one, ſcorning to be in his debt. And of méere good wil, to prouoke the Welchmans appetite, he had brought with him, in a little linnen bagge, a penyworth of chéeſe, and aſiſe of bread, which at the propounding of the ſecond Argument, taking the bagge foorth of his pocket, hee ſpread it vpon the pulpit, and ſet thercon the bread and chéeſe, and ſaide, becauſe I thought by your complexion, that there was ſome diet which troubled your ſtomacke for want of temperd digeſtion, I haue prouided for you;

                  Porrige igitur & manduca, gratias agens; reach to therefore, and eate, giuing thankes. It were pitty your mother ſhould loſe a ſonne by a ſurffet. Charitie then hath moued me to preſcribe you the beſt phiſicke I know of: and ſure it is moſt correſpondent to a man of your conſtitution. Aiax perceiuing it a vanity to deale with Vlyſſes, offered him the Gauntlet, and forſaking his piew, with folded fiſt he made toward Dobſon with a buffet, who met at the halfe ſword: but they had ſcarcely changed a couple of blowes, but they were diuided, and commanded, either to procéede informa, or to giue place to ſome better prepared, Dobſon retired to his ſettle, exſpecting another Argument. But the Welch man was without; his braines were troubled with this obiect, that for his life hée could not frame any further diſpute, and ſo deſcending with diſgrace for that time he departed the Schooles, but Dobſon continued foorth his time, anſwering all opponents whatſoeuer, and ſo ſufficiently, and with ſuch learning, that his fame thereupon grew to be great in the generall opinion of the Vniuerſitie, and the Welch man generally for euer after auoyded to take the pulpit againſt him.
            
            
               Of Dobſons ſecond diſpute againſt the Kentiſhmen: of his abuſe of them: and of his ſending to Bocardo. Chap. 14.
               
                  IN the terme following, he was aſſigned to be defendant in queſtions of philoſophy againſt certaine Kentiſhmen, with whom he conceiued to haue a more doubtful conflict, knowing the moſt parte of them to be ſerious ſtudents, captious, pregnant, couragious,

and indowed with ſingular quicke apprehenſions, and ſo many in number that he feared to be ſuppreſſed with multitudes, yet notwithſtanding he deuiſed how to cloſe their mouthes with a couer of plate; and albeit they might hap to inſult ouer him, by their ſpeculatiue knowledge, yet in practicall ſciences he was confident to haue the ſuperioritie. And againſt the day of his conference with them he thus prouided, he went to a painter in the citie, and procured him to draw at large and in liuely colours, a kennell of Foxes, marching in array of battaile and loaden with the ſpotles of their enemies, in the foreward was Reynold with a Caualieros cap of tawny hue, circled with a band of gold and pearle, to which was faſtned a bunch of blacke and red fethers, importing death, and ouer ſpreading his crowne, like a canopy, in his mouth he caried by the necke two ſlaughtered ſouldiers, the one a white gāder whoſe body he had hung vpon his right ſhoulder behinde, & vpon the left he bare the corps of a very faire red cocke, with ſome blacke & white freakles vpon the breaſt, & at the ioyuture of his taile to the ridge bone, they had placed (like a Portmantua) the carkaſſes of halfe a dozen yonger poultry: all which by maine force he had taken in the fight, & put to the ſword: with him was ranked on the left hand, dame Ermeline his wife, clothed in a gowne of gray cundeſted ſatin: her hat was white, and the band of ſiluered tinzell, with a bunch of blew and yellow feathers, which ouer-ſhadowed her browes forwarde, and detended her face from the ſcorching heate of the ſunne, ſhee reputing her ſelfe in proweſſe nothing inferior to ſir Reynold, and that the worl
                     •
                   might beare witneſſe that her valour was ſuch: he had ſpotles alſo to teſtifie the ſame, a gray goole, and a ſpeckled hen, with ſire ſiſter chickens, whome by dim of ſword, ſhe had ſubdued and ſlaughtered. After

them followed in good order a litter of yong Cubbes euery one whereof gaue teſtimony by their aboundance of prey, that a great ouerthrow had béen giuen to their enemies, and that the victory was wholly theirs, ſome carried the ſpoiles of the conies, other of Duckes, and ſome Pidgeons, onely the hinde moſt was plagued ſkipping at a bunch of grapes, but could not catch them: their tailes were painted of a large and ample ſiſe, bruſhing the ground where they ſéemed to pace; and vpon the floriſh of each thereof which bunched thicke, toward the end was artificially deuiſed inſcriptions, containing their names, offices, and the exploites by them atchiued, and the armes of Kent in white and blew ſtremers, in a field of Sable.
               When all theſe things were thus done (as he directed) he diſcharged the Painter for his worke-manſhip, and conueied the Pagient to his chamber, till the day of his anſwere of the Kentiſh opponent: when the time prefixed came, they repaired to the ſchooles, a little before the houre appointed, & cauſed a ſcréene to be ſet vpright in veiw of his aduerſarie, he faſtened thereupon in a table of wood the foreſaid pageant, drawing a veile before it, to kéepe it foorth of ſight, vntill hée thought fitte to diſcouer it, certaine Poemes he annexed as examplifications of the Pageant: which becauſe I will not be offenſiue to the Kentiſh-men, I paſſe ouer to a double poſt. When the clocke had ſtriken, and they flocked to the Schooles from euery Colledge of the Vniuerſity, to heare the queſtions in controuerſie decided betwixt the Northerne & Kentiſhmen, Dobſon was elected Primate of the Northerne companies, who came as defendants: and as beſeemed a noble harted Combatant, he entred the liſtes couragiouſly, animating his fellowes to ſecond him in ſemblable fortitudes and magnanimity, and with vn

daunted ſpirites, promiſing ſo to blunt al their weapons that not one ſhoulde haue power to pierce him. And becauſe it concerned the credit of himſelfe and all his countreimen, he kept his actes with aſmuch good order and formality as hee coulde poſſibly make ſhewe of: and ſuch exceſſe of learning he ſhewed in the whole placing thereof, as all admired his ſingular ſcience & knowledge: he put downe & droue two of thē to a non plus, the third aſcended the piew, whom alſo he quickely ſhifted frō the Saddle: and becauſe he would haue no commendations periſhed, by any of his fellows which himſelfe had purchaſed, he vnmaſked the ſciéene, and layd to there view the Kentiſh deſcription, at which ſight all the audience ſwelled with laughing. But the kentiſhmen not brookeing this abuſe, without any further proſecuting of their queſtions, made an vprore in the Schooles, and hauing no other weapons but their fiſts, they went to good ſad buffets the Northerne & Kentiſhmen, neither could all the reſidue ſet them aſunder, vntill the porters were ſent for by whome they were admoniſhed to deſiſt, and for that time expelled the Schooles, Dobſon and ſome others of the principals of both parties were ſent to Bocardo, where they remained vntill courſe was taken for their good behauiour in the Schooles in all futurity of times.
            
            
               
               How Dobſon kept his third diſpute in publike Schooles againſt one Malgrado, a fellow ſtudent of Chriſts Colledge, and of his expelling the Vniuerſitie. Chap. 15
               
                  THe Maiſter of Chriſts Colledge became Dobſons ſecuritie, vpon promiſe to forbeare theſe prouocations of brawles, which if he did not, he threatened to ſtay his Bachelors grace, & to expell him the Colledge, depriuing him of all meanes of further progace and maintenance, which inhibition he nothing reſpected. The very next time he was inioyned to kéepe his third act in publike, in which he was to deale with one of his owne Colledge, with whom alas hée knew a fault, and therefore more boldly aduentured to play the wanton, contrary to the Maiſters admoniſhment. This Malgrado (for ſo was the other diſputant ſurnamed) loued a Laundreſſe daughter of the Colledge, whom he many times harboured in his chamber, contrary to the ſtatutes of their houſe: and at ſuch times when ſhe came either to fet or bring his clothes to or from waſhing, he would priuily conuey her into his ſtudie, as opportunitie beſt fitted his purpoſe, and there many times the accompanied him for the ſpace of foure or fiue dayes, and ſometimes more, being letted of fit diſpatching her away by ſome of his fellowes, whom vpon ſome extraordinarie kindneſſe noted betwixt them, priuily watched their familiar vſage of one another, to whom he gaue diligent reſpect that they might not take him napping. Dobſon ſuggeſting all

occaſions he could aduiſe vpon, to bolt forth the truth, at laſt catched the Cat in the Mouſe-fall. Malgrado liuing in Penſioners common, when it pleaſed his gueſt to diet with him, was accuſtomed to ſiſe either of the Cookes, or amongſt the Schollers a whole meſſe of meat, which his large prouiſion firſt bred obſeruation, and after betraied his cauſe; for Dobſon and his aſſociats by this meanes diſcouered the Cat in a caſket: which came thus to paſſe. One Sunday at the afternoone, when the moſt part of Students were gone abroad, ſome to heare Sermons, other to take the ayre in the fields, as euery mans diſpoſition allotted him, Malgrado had appointed his friend to reſort to his chamber, into the which he ſafely conducted her in reſpect of their abſence, purpoſing that while they continued at the Sermons, he would that with her a little, and ſo diſmiſſe her before their returne: But ſuch content he tooke in her company, that he forgot himſelfe, and was forced to ſtay her all the night: for at euening time they al came home to the Colledge, becauſe no man durſt abſent himſelfe from prayer, and ſo Malgrado was conſtrained to go thither alſo, ſuſpecting that if he abſtained, it might occaſionate his chamber to be ſearched, and then it was not poſſible for his friend to auoid their ſight, he hauing no conueyance wherein to conceale her, but onely a baſket which he hung aloft in his chamber, binding it with two ſtrong ropes to a croſſe beame, wherein vſually he thruſt her, if he feared the preſence of any of his fellowes, hauing ſo deuiſed, that the end of the rope paſſing through the wall of his ſtudie, he might wind vp and downe the baſket at his pleaſure. He therefore compelld to kéep her til he might gaine a conuenient time to ſet her packing, was vrged that night to ſiſe double commons, and from the Cookes he carried a ſhoulder of mutton, not without the obſeruation of Dobſon and diuers

of his fellowes, who ſaid nothing wherby he might perceiue their ſuſpicions, yet aſſured themſelues that miſtreſſe Debora was a bidden gueſt. And when they conceiued him and his familiar to be in the middeſt of their ſupper, vp the ſtaires they ruſhed with a Porters ſtaſte to haue carried them both to the Tole boothe, but he preuented their ſoden entrance, by bolting the doore againſt them, which he kept ſhut vntill he had beſtowed her into the baſket, and drawne it vp as high as the beame whereunto it was faſtened: which done he ſet open the doores and let them enter, and to ſearch his chamber in euerie corner, but they could find nothing, till being readie to depart, ſaith Dobſon, fellow Malgrado, I ſuppoſed that you ſhed a ſhoulder of mutton to ſupper, what haue you done with the remainder, ſurely my commons were ſo ſtender, that I intended at my comming hither to haue mended my fare with you, if this vnruly rabble had not interrupted me: and therefore I pray thee if thou haſt any left, let vs haue it, and we will fetch ſome beere and be merry. Faith (ſaith Malgrado) I haue left ſome little, but that I haue giuen to my Cat, which I keepe here in my baſket to kill my Rats, and ſhe I thinke by this hath pared the reſidue to the bone. If that be ſo ſaid Dobſon, then didſt thou either eate very much, or thy Cat was greatly hungry. But I pray thée let vs ſée, it ſhall be very ſore fowled, if I take not part with her of that which is behind. But Malgrado fearing that his pelicies would appeare, crcuſed the matter, and ſaid, that it could not be but that the Cat had made it paſt mans eating. Notwithſtanding (ſaid Dobſon) I will not beleeue it, vnleſſe I ſee it, neither ſhall this ſhift ſerue to ſaue your vinuals, and making no more to do, cut the rope in ſunder with a Halbert, when downe came Miſtreſſ Debora in the baſket, and in her fall ſhe cryed, O helpe friend Malgrado, or

I periſh, but ſhe had no ſupporters vntill ſhe came vpon the chamber where ſhe was relieued with more attendanes then ſhe deſired, and that the truth of her cōming thither might be manifeſted, the Maſters and fellowes were ſent for to take her examination, who hauing really confeſſed her acquaintance and familiarity with Malgrado, with promiſe neuer more to frequent his company (eſpecially in the Colledge) ſhe was let to goe without further puniſhment, & Malgrado was admoniſhed vpon the paine of expulſion to abſtaine from ſuch acquaintance with all women whatſoeuer, during the time of his ſtay in the Colledge. Dobſon therefore hauing this blot in Malgradoes booke, verſified vpon this theame at large in the publique audience, vpon the day of their diſpute, and to quite Malgradoes oratory who excelled Dobſon in Rethoricke, yea and in rayling too, when they had diſputed their firſt queſtion, Dobſon drewe forth from vnder his gowne a baſket which of purpoſe he had prouided, and lifting vp the couer, forth ſkippeth a Cat, offering to run away, but Dobſon catching her by the tayle, ſaid, nay I beſeech you to ſtay good Miſtris Debora, you ſhall ſuppe before you paſſe, for your familiar friend Malgrado hath ſiſed a ſhoulder of motton which he drawing forth of the baſket preferred to the poore amaſed Cat, who ſhreeking & crying ſcratched him by the fingers vntill ſhe was deliuered: the Schooles were admired of the myſtery, neither did any man knowe what cōſtruction to giue thereto, while Dobſon vnfolded all the former circumſtances, which the audience hearing, thruſt Malgrado from the Pulpit and gaue Dobſon a generall applauſe, aſwell for his learned diſputes as his commicall conceits. But Malgrado complained of this diſorder to the Maſter of their houſe, who conſidering, that not only Malgrado, but the whole houſe, by this diſcouery were made ridiculous

to the whole Vniuerſity, by thaſſent of the whole Chapter expelled Dobſon both the Colledge and the Vniuerſity at the very inſtant when he ſhould haue proceeded Bachelour. Dobſon taking in euill part this diſgrace, againſt the day of the Bachelours commencement, he ſet vpon the Colledge gates the picture of Malgrado with a Bachelours cappe and gowne, in his right hand holding Miſtris Debora in a baſket, and in the other a Cat tyed in a chaine with a ſhoulder of mutton about hir necke, about him he placed the picturs of the miſtris of the houſe and the fellowes in their Doctors roabes, with coxecombes vpon the crownes of their cappes, and in each mans hand a fox tayle, and a paire of ſhéeres, this ſtatue he erected an houre before day, and ſo tooke him to his héeles, leſt if he were catcht he ſhoulde be puniſhed for the ſame, bidding Cambridge and the Schooles adew.
            
            
               Howe Dobſon became an Oaſtler and a ſeruingman, howe he beate his Miſtris for the loue of her maide, and how he ſhould haue hanged for riding away with his Maiſters horſe, and of his end. The laſt Chap.
               
                  
                     DObſon being in this manner baniſhed the Vniuerſity, not daring to looke vpon his Vnckle, and aſhamed to returne to his Country in this diſhonour, when he came at Huntington, he hired himſelfe to an Inkeeper where he played the vnder Oaſtler for the ſpace of a yeare to his great grief and diſcontent, vntill a Gentleman of his country pittying that ſo able a boy, and well qualified as by his diſcourſe and carriadge he ſeemed to be, ſhould ſo baſely beſtowe

himſelfe perſwaded him to giue ouer that trade of life, & to become a ſeruingman, which he told him was a more commendable courſe, leſſe painefull, and could not be otherwiſe then more profitable alſo. Dobſon ſoone aſſented to his perſwaſion hauing vſed the other but of meere neceſſity, and becauſe he did not knowe howe to liue otherwiſe, the gentleman therefore concluding with him for reaſonable wages, ſecretly conueighed him from Huntington to his owne houſe, with whome he ſtayed the ſpace of another yeare alſo, in which time for his diligence and behauiour he gotte a ſingular opinion both of his Maiſter and Miſtris, vntill this had happened. His Miſtris had a coſen who attended her in the chamber, an hanſome girle, with whome Dobſon came more familiarly acquainted then was allowed of, and alſo ſhee afforded him equall affection and loue, which cauſed her to haue many a lowering countenance of her Aunte, but ſhe ſet light of them in regard of Dobſons fauour, much difficulty he ſuffered before he could impart his minde to her, which had not needed if he had beene aſſured of the maides good meaning toward him, who if modeſty had not letted her, had firſt moued the ſuite to him, and neuer pauſed after his firſt motion made to giue him anſwers or to aduiſe of the matter, but proteſted at the very inſtant to be his affected & pawned the ſame with a kiſſe, yet they concluded to diſſemble the ſame, and to keepe it ſecret from their Maiſter and Miſtris. But loue like the fire, firſt ſmoking, and then flaming, increaſed ſo betwixt them that it burſt forth to open viewe of all: their exterior ſhewes betrayed their interior ſecretes, and ſo apparant it was to the whole houſe, that their Maiſter and Miſtris had information of the ſame, which the Miſtris ill diſgeſted in reſpect ſhe was her Néece, and he a ſtranger vnknowne to any of them, eyther his eſtate,

condition, or parentage, which he willingly concealed becauſe he would not haue his Vnckle to receaue any certificat of his courſe of life, ſhe therefore ſtrictly commanded her Coſen to abſteyne from his company, and in no ſort to vſe him familiarly, as ſhe cared to auoide her finall diſpleaſure, but this charge was of as much force as if ſhe had taken woode and throwne into the flame forbidding it to burne, for women are neuer earneſt in loue vntill ſuch time as they be forbidden to loue. When therfore her miſtris had abriged her of al meanes of ſpeaking with him in the houſe, appointed to meete him at the pen when the maids came to milking, where ſhe to gratifie their fellowes & the rather to induce them to conceale their meetinges, for her Miſtris did diuerſe times feaſt and banquet them with poſſets and the like conceites. But in all ſocieties there are euer ſome falſe brothers, when to picke a thanke, or to gaine a particular fauour to themſelues, diſſupplant their fellowes, ſo among theſe maides there was one chattering pie, who thruſt into the miſtris head al their intercourſe of loue and familiaritie which then paſſed, for which the poore wench had many a ſound chiding, yet ſtoode to denie all, ſo long that her conſtant negatiue one night moued her miſtris to put vpon her a womans attyre, and ſecretly to conuay herſelfe into a Calfehouſe, hiding her ſelfe in the ſtrawe vnd
                     •
                  r the cribbe, vntill the time of milcking, purpoſing to try whet
                     ••
                  r her coſen or the maide were in the trueth. And the ſame night they had aſſigned Dobſon to be preſent at a poſſet of ſacke, neuer ſuſpecting that their miſtris had any notice of their good felowſhip in that place, much leſſe that ſhee was preſent to beholde their paſtimes. But only ſhe who had ſet her to the watche. While Dobſon ſtayed longer than the houre aſſigned, they thought fit to make an ende of

milkeing, that when he came they might haue nothing to ſtay them further, then only the diſpatch of the poſſet, and alſo, leſt ſtaying later abroade then they were accuſtomed, their miſtris might haue iealoſie of ſome ſuch matter. One of the maides, ſhe who had firſt milked, went into the calfehouſe to pul a roſe, and as it woulde be, ſhe piſt into hir miſtris necke vnknowne to hir, while at her going forth, ſhe had a glimſe of one lying couered in the ſtrawe, at which both aſhamed and afraide ſhee came forth & related what had befallē her, ſome laughed at the caſe a little, others cared how to diſpoſe of the poſſet, tuſhe ſaieth her coſen, loue making her bolde, if the caſe be ſo plaine, let vs ſtand to it like frindes, let them flinch that feares, we wil take no knowledge of her preſence, God be thanked we knowe the worſt, it is but the loſſe of a ſeruice, a chiding, a bundel of batts, and ſtart I will not til my friend come, if it be not till midnight, I wil either vrge her to come & take part with vs, or weary her of her lodging, but preſently hereupon appeareth ſir Dobſon whom he much blamed for his lingring, withall, reuealing on what difficulties they ſtood vpon, in regard their miſtris had ſet watch to trap them, no matter ſaide he, let vs firſt conquere this aduerſary, and referre me to pacifie our miſtris anger, I knowe a carde wherewith to coole the heate of my miſtris fiery ſtomacke. And ſo whē the banquetended, willing them to walke homewarde, he with a good faſt cudgell entered the calfehouſe, where with many a luſty blowe he happed his miſtris about the ſhoulders, notwithſtanding that ſhee entreated him to ſtay his handes and not to beate her being his miſtris, no quoth hee thou arte ſome viſarde witch, that pretendeſt ſome miſchiefe to my miſtris her beaſts, or elſe ſome naughty packe queane, in league with the maids, to coſen my miſtris of the milke. My miſtris is a gentlewoman

of good worſhippe, and would not for the worlde be ſeene in this baſe and ragged attyre, and therefore I wil hamper thee like as thou art, and ſo doubling his blowes he beate her againe till himſelfe was weary, and ſhee ſo lamed that ſhe was not able to ſtand, but falling downe vpon her knees, ſhe ſaide, O good George I pray thee to take ſome pitty vpon me and kill me not forth-right, for in very trueth I am thy miſtris, and came of purpoſe in this diſguiſed and ragged cloathing, to eſpie and ſee thy vſege and behauiour with my maides, to whome I am contented to remit as to thee all that euer you haue treſpaſſed againſt me, conditionally that thou now ceaſe frō beating me, and help to conduct me home, for thou haſt ſo ſqueized me that I am not able to goe alone, he ſeemeing by theſe ſpeeches to be brought into ſome doubt that it ſhould be his miſtris indeed, carried her into the light where beholding her in the viſage as though before he had not knowne her, he cried her mercy, & appeared very ſorrowfull, requeſting her to pardon him, affirming that he did not beleeue that it ſhoulde be her ſelfe, but ſome other rogiſh ill diſpoſed woman, and proſtrating himſelfe vpon his knees he aſked her hartily forgiueneſſe (as ſhe ſuppoſd) and that he had beat hir of ignorance, wherwith ſhee the more eaſily pardoned him, and ſtaying her ſelfe vpon his ſhoulders ſhe walked home with him, but he had ſo baſted her, as for fiue wéekes after, ſhe was cō
                  ſtrained to keepe her bed, in which time ſhee was informed of the whole betwirt him and her maides as touching her beating, for which atterwards the coulde neuer endure him, and to curbe his deſires ſhe priuately cauſed her kinſwoman to be conueighed away he did not know whither, for which he became ſo diſcontent, that when his maſter was vpon occaſions gone towardes London his miſtris ſending him to a coſens houſe about ſome buſineſſe,

he rode away with his maſters beſt gelding, ſold him alſo and ſpent the mony neuer returning to giue anſwere of his meſſage: his maſter at his comming backe from London, made dilligent enquiry after his man & his horſe, and at the length being certified of his aboade, and the ſale of his horſe, he areſted him with a Juſtices warrant, and got him committed to the Caſtle at Yorke, where he was to aunſwere the aſſiſes, and had hanged without remiſſion, if his vnkle had not made meanes for his repriue vntill he procured him a pardon. For after that he was hanckeled in ſo great extremity, he directed letters to his vnckle, certifieng him of his lamentable caſe craueing pardon for all his former euagations, & promiſing future reformation and to reclaime himſelfe from al lewd behauiours, deſiring alſo his vnkle to prouide him a Channons place in Dunholme, whereby hee might be maintained ſufficiently if he eſcaped death, and that through want he needed not be conſtrained to proſecute any more ſuch barbarous courſes. Nature & pittie concurring in his vnkles breſt inforced him to afford his helping hand. And by maſter Deanes meanes and the Prebends he got him freed from death, and impriſonment, and alſo beneficed in the Abbey, as he requeſted. Whereupon entring into conſideration how much Almighty God and his frindes had helped him, he mortified all his irregular paſſions and ſpent the reſidue of his courſe in an admirable courſe of ciuility. For the which he was generally reſpected of all the people & the whole Cleargie, and after the death of his Vnkell, poſſeſſed of all his ſubſtance and beneficed with his Vicarige, in which eſtate he ended and finiſhed his life.
