               IF nowe by my meanes (friendly Reader) yet in thy behalfe, Dioniſius may be vnderſtood in engliſh, as I iudge, and hope, thou canſt not be therat offended. It is long ſythence he wrote in the Greeke tongue, and hath bin tranſlated into Latine of late yeares, by dyuers. In whoſe commendation, if he had needed other than hys owne, purchaſed by iuſt deſerte, ſince he firſte wrote, I wold not haue wanted to haue done my endeuoure. But for ſo muche as he is accompted of all antiquitie, the olde writer, for compendiouſneſſe and breuity in that he tooke in hand: ſufficiēt it ſhal be in prayſe or authoritie to haue yealded to him his owne, & no more. Whiche what it is read Plinie, and there vnderſtand howe that the author

of this woorke beeing borne in Alexandria, a citie in Eegypt, deſcended of a moſte noble familie, abounding in great welth & authoritie, wrote not only this woorke, whiche wee haue interpreted, The Surueye of the habitable Worlde in Hexameter verſes, beeing as yet but very yong: but alſo many other, both lerned and eloquēt. Who afterward reſorting to the courte of Rome, was ſent by Auguſtus the Emperour, to ſurueye & report the ſtate & ſituation of cuntries in the eaſt parts of the worlde, when his eldeſt ſonne was vpon expedition into Armenia, to the Parthians, and Arabians. What ſhall I ſay, that ther haue bin many other worthy men of that name, who haue bē ſuppoſed to be the authors of this boke? howbeit, falſly in my opinion, as by farther diſcourſe (at this preſent) not neceſſarie, I could declare. In my trāſlation, I truſt I haue obſerued all requiſite cōditions, expreſſing (ſo well as I coulde) the intent

of the Authour. And for thy commoditie adioyning to the names of coū
               treys and other places, in olde tyme frequented, the vſuall names alſo wherby they are knowne by all trauailers at this day, not omitting of certaine woordes, whiche were alwayes Latine, and ſo vſed, to make them Engliſhe for orders ſake, not knowing any cauſe to the contrarye. As bycauſe out of Europa, wee terme commonly Europe: ſo lykewyſe to ſay for Aſia, Aſie, and for Africa, Afrike, with ſuche lyke what euer. Accepte this the trauaile of vs both thankfully: and if thou receiue any pleſure or commoditie therby, then haue I for my part, atteyned to my deſire.

               The deſcription of Aſie.
               THe plateforme of Aſie, being as ſome men ſay, of one faſhion, and as other ſay of another: yet is it well knowne, that it reſembleth very muche a wedge. For it beginneth with a certaine large baſes, or foundation, and ſo goeth foorth along to the ende, where the pillers of Dionyſius whiche was borne at Thebe,

                   to Euxinum, where as there dwell kinds of people almoſt innumerable, foraſmuch as betwéene them bothe, there lyeth a great Iſthmus, conteyning a very large plot of ground. But the mounte Taurus which as I haue ſaid diuideth the whole through the middle, beginneth at Pamphilia,
                  Pamphilia, and ſtretcheth forth to the Indie, which riſing in ſome places into greater heigth than other, and turning on bothe ſydes, much like the crookes of a Bulles hornes, whiche is gréedie of his foode, is by ſimilitude thereof called Taurus, that is to ſaye, a Bull. Out of this mounte there doe aryſe almoſte infinite ſprings and waters, whereof ſome runne Eaſt, ſome Weſt, ſome North ſome Southe, which by reſon they paſſe by diuers coū

But it is no eaſieCaucaſus. matter to declare bothe the names of it, whereby it is notified in dyuers languages, or of the waters therefore flowing. That care take they who inhabite the néere places, it only remayneth to mée, to declare thoſe ryuers and nations, whereof we coulde attayne any lyght of vnderſtanding. In recytal whereof, I will not quaile ſo far as my poore abilitie ſhall ſerue me. Wherefore the people of Maeorae, and Sauromatae,

The ſame is the water whiche alſo parteth Europe from Aſie, leuing Europe at the Weſt, and Aſie at the Eaſt.

For ſo ſoone as the northern wind beginneth to blow, and the colde to encreaſe, immediately they ſée before their eyes their horſes and Mules fall downe deade, and their

And generally all Syria is very riche, and plentyfull, abounding with corne and paſture for grazyng of cattell, at whoſe inlande partes, which are to the Southe moſte adiacent, lyeth

the entrance to the ſea Arabicum, which waſheth the ſhoares of both Arabia and Syria continually: howbeit by little and little turning to the eaſt, approcheth the Elani, where as the Arabes lye, poſſeſſingElani. Arabes. a countrey of all other moſte rytheſt and precious. It ſtandeth highe, and is enuironed with two ſeas, Perſicum, and Arabicum, and lyeth alſo open vnto two wynds. For the Arabicum requireth a Weſtern wynd, and Perſicum an Eaſterne. But that parte of Arabia whych lyeth to the eaſt and ſouth, is waſhed alſo with the Red ſea, called Mare rubrum.
               
               Of this countreye I wyll ſpeake ſomewhat, bycauſe it conteyneth many regions, whoſe power and wealth, all other doe wonder at, and are amazed to beholde their greate ſtore and abundaunce.
               And I wyll not omitte, that béeing verye muche delyghted with Sacrifice, there is no one parte of all the countrey but dothe ſmelle of Parfume and Myrrhe, and of ſoote ſmellyng Calamus, whiche are caſte into the fire to burne.

Who will not take it for an vndoubted truth, that Iupiter, being father to Dionyſius, tooke him foorth of his thinghe, atIupiter father to Dionyſius. the celebration of whoſe natiuitie, he repleniſhed the whole countrey with fragrant odoures? And that thoſe ſhéepe, wherwith Arabia aboundeth, obteyned that guift, that while they were féeding, they ſhould be clad in thick and fine fléeſes? and the pondes and waters ſwarme with varietie and multitude of Fiſhes? And that ſo many flocks of birds forſoke the deſerte, and came thither, bringyng with thē boughs of precious Cinamom wherwith that coūtrey now is wonderfully ſtored? Moreouer, that this Dionyſius after that he was borne, and ſomewhat ſprong vp, wearing on the ſkinne of a yong Goate, and hauing his lockes treſſed vp with yuie, and vine leaues, & his belly ful of good wine, went wandering about all the countrey, rather pouring foorth vnmeaſurablye, than beſtowing moderatly great riches, & ſowing golde like ſéede, to bryng foorthe fruite which ſhould neuer periſh? And for that cauſe all that region vntill this daye is

thought to abound with ſuch commodities, that the very hilles yeld forth gold, and the Riuers ſiluer, and theyr ſhores and bankes balme and ſoote herbes, and the inhabitants be very rich, and weare none other garments than of pure gold, or fyne ſilke. They whiche dwell vppon the browe of the hill Libanus, the ſameLibanus. Nabathaei. Chalbaſii. Agrees. Chatramis. Perſis. Minaei. Sabae.

But the Minaei, and the Sabae, lye on the redde ſea ſhoare, and the Cletabei, nighe vnto them. And theſe bée all the kingdomes and nations in Arabia, whiche I ſuppoſed to be woorth memorie. Howebeit, ther be ſome more rude, & altogither wt
                  out any fame, and neyther for maners, nor learning, woorthie to be accompted among the Arabes. For towardes the Weaſt, and vttermoſte ſyde of Arabia, dwell a people called Erembi, a rougheErembi. and wylde nation, dwelling vppon the hilles and mountaynes, and haue none other houſes than dennes, and ragged hollowe rockes, going all naked, and

hauing no kind of felicitie, or happineſſe that aperteyneth to mā, and being dryed vp with ſharpneſſe of liuing: haue burned their ſkinne with blacke coloure. And if there happen vnto them anye trouble: they betake not themſelues to armour, not to their arrows, not to their weapons as other do, but like wilde and ſauage beaſtes, run through woods ouer hilles and dales, not like the other Arabians, whome nature hath indued wyth ſuch and ſo many benefits. But on the other ſide of Libanus, which lyeth to theLibanus. Eaſt, there openeth another parte of Syria, butting foorth to Sinopes now Sinopi,

                  Meſopotamia. and Tigris, is called Meſopotamia of the Grecians, nowe Halapia, whyche is of ſuche ſorte and nature, that there is no ſheapheard, or grazer, what euer he bée, though he were of

counſell with Pan the god of ſhepherds, can in any parte fynde faulte with that countrey for goodneſſe of paſture: nor any planter iuſtly condemne the frutes whiche grow there wylde in the hedges and woods, either for lacke of ſtore, varietie or pleaſantneſſe of verdure. For there is ſuche plentie of all thing growing, and ſuche abundaunce of herbes and floures, that the country is accompted bleſſed and verye acceptable to the gods. Alſo the countrey which is next, lying to the north, is very good and rich, the Armenei poſſeſſe it, which dwell inArmenei.

is called now by hir name, being not far from Colchis, and neuer durſte returne home agayne to beholde hir Parentes wéeping eyes, whoſe wrathe ſhe muche feared. Wherefore the people there vntyll thys daye, are muche enclined to Magicke, Witchcrafte, and Sorcerie. The countrie is verie large, and hath in it manye Hilles and Mountaynes, wherein the precious ſtone Narciſſites

For at the one ſide lyeth the way Hircana, on the otherThe way Hyrcana.

it, nor yet to paſſe by Sea into any other countrie, or to get any thing by trafique of marchandiſe. Neyther is there any among them that followeth or féedeth any heardes of cattell. But ſo ſoone as euer they be of any yeares, eyther they take a bowe in hand and learne to ſhoote, or elſe they practiſe running on foote, or horſebacke, vntill they become maruellous readie therein. For that countrie is alwayes ratling and crackling with Dartes, broken launces, or ſtrokes of arrowes. There is alſo continually hearde the noyſe whiche fierce and couragious horſes do make whē they méet and fyght togyther. And it is not lawful for any there to go to ſupper before that with ſuche like exerciſe all his body be in a ſweat. They lyue chiefly by hunting, whiche they followe, darting or ſhooting, in whiche and alſo for theyr ſauage demeanoure, howbeit they ſéeme inuincible, yet being ouercome by y• Romain Captaine, were compelled to obey the Faſces, béeing a fewe rods bounde aboutThe Romane Faſces. an axe, & ſo borne before y• officer, ye peculiar ſcepter of y• Romaine Empire.
