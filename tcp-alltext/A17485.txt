               SIR, I entreate you, patronize this smal Treatise, if in your iudgement it can either pleasure, or in small measure profite, by being divulged to the open view of the world: If otherwise, lay it by you as a bundle of waste paper. In so doing, I shal thinke my selfe much obliged vnto you: if in suppressing the originall, my weakenesse may rather take a priuate checke of a friend for being too bolde, then an open scorne of a multitude, for being too foolish.

               Cap. I.
               
                  How the Kingdome of Barbary came to Muley Hamet Xarif, the late deceased King.
               
               
                  THE Familie of the Mareines beeing Larbies, were long times Kings of Barbary: vntill a plaine Haly some hundred Any one vvhich is not of the tribe of Mahemet is so tearmed. Or Dravve. yeres agoe, calling himselfe Muley Hamet Xarif, came out of the countrey of Dara, (lying beyond the mountains of Atlas) with a great number of Montaniers, called in their owne language Brebers: these with their strength got Moruecos from the Mareins. And going forwarde following the fertilnes of the soyle, draue the Mareins out of Fes: getting into his power all the flat countries comprised vnder the titles of Sus, Moruecos, and Fes, from the hilles of Atlas to the straits of Gybraltar. Being thus growne great, be would proue himselfe a Xarif, one of the kindred of the Prophet Mahome
                        •…
                     , desiring his birth might be held answerable to his new acquired fortunes:

But within a little time after this his sodaine inuasion, Sus rebelling, refused his gouernment, wherefore he sent to the bordering Turkes for ayde, who fulfilled therein his request. Aided with these turkish auxiliary forces, he set forward, and at his enterance into that kingdome, y• turkish souldiers through treason killed him, & cut of his head; sacked Taradant, and running ouer the whole countrey, spoyled it by the space of twoo moneths, which done, they would gladly haue returned to Trimasine: yet fearing their owne strength to return the same way Hamet had brought them; it was helde their better course and shorter iourney, to passe ouer the Mountaines: but the Montaniers knowing this their new done bloody fact, and séeing them haue good store of pillage, set vpon them, so that few or none escaped their handes, but were all slaine. After this Hamet Xarifs death, who raigned some eight yeares, succéeded his brother Muley Abdela, hauing all his life time great warre with the Mareins, to kéepe that his brother had conquered: hee hauing raigned some fiftéene yeares died, leauing behind him thirtéene sonnes, the eldest Muley Abdela (who at his entrance to the kingdome, commaunded all his brethren to bee killed:) but the second brother Abdelmelech fearing hard measure, fled presently vppon the death of his Father into Turkie, and so saued his life. The third brother Muley Hamet of whome we are hereafter to entreate, béeing held a great Church man, simple and humble spirited, not any way addicted vnto armes, was spared aliue as lesse feared. The other ten were all put to death in one day at Taradant in Sus, where they were kept in their Fathers life time. This Abdela raigned fortie yeares, and dying, left behinde him thrée sonnes, Muley Mehamet, Muley Sheck, Muley Nassar. Muley Mehamet beeing King, his twoo yonger brethren ranne away into Spaine, the elder wherof named Muley Sheck is yet liuing, and there turned

Christian. The yonger brother called Muley Nassar returned into Barbary, in the fourteenth yeare of Muley Hamets raign, who died last. At this Muley Nassars landing in the country of Fes, much people fauoured him and his title, & two thousand of Muley Shecks souldiers (who now liueth, and then gouerned Fes, for his Father reuolted from him to Nassar, insomuch as Muley Sheck was in mind to haue fled vnto his Father. But that Alkeyd Hamet Ben lau, being a very wise Captaine, and there placed to helpe Muley Sheck by his councell, who was very yong,) kept him from running away: and Muley Nassar with a dilatory warre, with whome if the souldiers had staied, he might peraduenture haue gotten the country. But their Lent approaching, the souldiers tolde Nassar, they would go kéepe their Easter at their owne houses. Whervpon Nassar, thinking if they were once gone, they would neuer returne to him againe, would giue present battaile, & so was this Nassar slaine. Abdelmelech being second brother to Abdela, got such fauor in Turkie where he liued, as entering Barbary with foure thousand Turkish souldiers, he got the kingdome from his Nephew Mehamet the eldest sonne of Abdela, and their raigned two yeares. Muley Mehamet thus depriued of his kingdome, fledde for succour to Sebastian then King of Portugale, who came in person into Barbarie to helpe him with thirtie thousand men, giuing battaile, the Mores fled, and the Christians retired, hoping the Mores would returne, that so the Christians might make the greater slaughter of them. According to this expectation Abdelmelech with his armie returned, and the Christians charged the formost of their horsemen very hotly, who would haue fledde. But such was the aboundance of Abdelmelechs horsemen, following the foreward which were discō

                  Don Sebastian King of Portugale: Muley Mehamet vnto whose ayde Sebastian came ouer: And Abdelmelech who came out of Turkie being second brother to Abdela▪
                   This Abdelmelech left behind him a sonne yet liuing at this day in Turkie, whose name is Muley Smime. After the death of these twoo, Abdelas third brother, Muley Hamet Xarif, was made King, raigned about twenty seauen yeares in great peace and felicity, vntill he went to take his sonne Muley Sheck at Fes, where the Father dyed, whose death hath caused all these warres, as yea may reade hereafter.

                  The course of Muley Hamet Xarifs gouernment, during his 27. yeares raigne.
               
               
                  OBtaining the Scepter, he first prouided himselfe of the grauest men he could finde in his Kingdomes, to be Counsellors of estate; then of the most experienced, and valiant souldiers, for Commanders ouer his campe, and Garrison townes. And whereas hee was Monarch ouer two Nations, the Larbies, and Brebers, hee found it requisite to vse a two-folde gouernment. The Larbies dwelling in the best plaine champion Country of his three Kingdomes, Moruecos, Sus, and Fes, were easily gouerned, being of milde and peaceable nature, giuen to thrift and tillage of the ground, sought no alterations, but receiuing from him a due forme of iustice executed by his Ministers: protecting them from the Montaneirs which are robbers, willingly obeyed his Regall authoritie, and yearly payed

their tenths towards their Kings maintenance. As for the Brebers, or Montaneirs, beeing of an vntamed and fierce disposition, speaking the Tamiset tongue, which is as much different from the Larbee, as Welch is from our English, dwelling in places by nature defencible, and almost inaccessible: He could not so well gouerne, neither had euer such absolute power ouer them, nor receiued the fift pennie of profite from them, as hee did from the Alarbeis. Therefore hee sought by all meanes to diminish their strength of people, drawing them alwayes into forraigne expeditions, especially into that warre, against the Negros, which continued a long time, thereby extending his Empire so farre that way, as by Camell it was sixe Moneths iourney from Morruecos, to the farthest parts of his Dominion. Likewise, he vsed this people to goe with the Carabans to Gago, to fetch A company of Marchants going together for trading, with a great number of Horses, Camels, and Mules, laden with Commodities. home his yearely tribute and custome, whereby manie were consumed in trauailing ouer the Saharas: for anie offence or robberie committed by them, his sword should punish seuerely, that the rest might feare: diuiding their Countrey into seuerall diuisions or Cantons, in euerie which hee placed an Alkeyd, with souldiers to suppresse any suddaine vprores, must like our Lieutenant set ouer our seuerall Countyes, but that the Alkeyd is continually resident, and hath greater power in executing Marshall law. And lastly, as pledges of their loyalties, hee would get their chiefest mens sonnes into his hands, bringing them vp in his Court to a more ciuill and delicate kinde of life. He was alwayes of minde to keepe peace with Christendome, with Spaine, who was his next potent neighbour, but aboue all loued the English Nation, and admired the late Queenes happie gouernement, willing to entertaine trading with vs, witnesse his manie letters, written to that worthie Ladie of happie memorie. And his Embassage sent vnto her, Anno. 1601. performed by Abdala Wahad

Anowne, and Hamet Alhadg, their great trauailer to Mecha, and other places.
               Towards his subiects he was not too tyrannicall, but sweetned his absolute power and will, with much clemencie. By diuerse wayes he got excessiue store of gold. First, by seeing his tenths truly payed from the Larbees: Secondly, by trading with the Negroe, taking vp the salt at Tegazza, and selling it at Gago, hauing from thence returne in good golde. Thirdly, by husbanding his Maseraws, or I

Canes did growe, (though nowe all spoyled with these warres,) for it is sufficiently knowne, all of them about Morruecos, Taradant, and Magador, were yearely worth vnto him, sixe hundred thousand ounces at the least. I omit his loue he tooke in entertaining forraigne Artisans, the reedifying of his house in Morruecos, getting Italian Marbles, the richest that could bee bought for money, and workmen hired from thence at great wages. His sumptuous prouisions for the Saraile, 
                  The place where his women are kept. and maintenance of his women, not so much delighting in the sinne, as his predecessors had done before, as to shew his glorie, because the fashion of the Countrey is such, to shewe their riches and greatnesse vpon that fraile sexe, and their attendances. For his chiefest pleasures were to see the gallantrie of his kingdome, managing their good Barbarian Steedes, and the Falcons vpon their wing, making faire flights after the Heron: for these sports hee was prouided, no man better, from which hee was recalled by certaine discontents, which as clowds forerunned his owne Sunset.

                     MVley Hamet Xarif the late deceased king and father of these thrée brothers now liuing that striue for the kingdome, at the time of his death left fiue sonnes aliue. The eldest Muley Mahemet, commonly called Muley Sheck, a title giuen alwaies to the eldest of the kings sonnes: The second Muley Boferes, which two sons were both by one woman, a Negra, one of his concubines: The third sonne Muley Sidan whome he had by one of his wiues: The fourth sonne Muley Nassar who was about the age of Ninetéen yeares: And the fift Muley Abdela about Fourtéene yeares old at the time of the old kings death, and these twoo last were not legitimate, but the sonnes of two seuerall Concubins. This deceased King in his life time, had placed his thrée elder sons in seuerall parts of his kingdome, to gouerne for him in them, to Muley Sheck his eldest he had giuen the kingdome of Fes, which kingdome hath in former times continually béen allotted by the late kings of Barbary to their eldest sonnes: Muley Boferes he placed in his kingdome of Sus: to Muley Sidan he gaue the prouince of Tedula, which lyeth in the mid-way betwéene Moruecos, and Fes: his two yonger sonnes Muley Nassar, and Abdela remained with him in his house, whome by reason of their yong yeares, he had not as yet placed in any part of his kingdomes. The eldest sonne Muley Sheck in his yonger yeares gouerned Fes, & those partes of Barbarie, with great approbation of his father, through y• counsell of Basha Mustepha a Spanish Renegado: which Basha in

continuance of time, grewe into such fauour with him, that the whole gouernment of the kingdome of Fes was wholly by Mu: Sheck put into his hand

                  : Whervpon y• 
                  Alkeyds of the countrie that were naturall borne Mores, & continuall attendants vpon the old King, enuying the greatnes of the said Basha, raised diuers accusations against him: Complaining to the King that he learned Muley Sheck to drinke wine (a thing vnlawfull to the Mores, being forbidden them by their Prophet Mahomet) and that now hauing the whole gouernment of the kingdome of Fes in his hands, vnder the kings sonne, he purposed after he had possessed himselfe of Muley Shceks treasure, to flie, and carry it with him to some partes of Christendome. Which accusations the old King vpon some probabilities and likelihoods conceiuing to be true, these Alkeyds procured at last with him, that he should send to his Sonne Muley Sheck, commaunding him to send the head of the said Basha, which commaund howsoeuer Muley Sheck (who greatly loued, and fauoured the said Basha) at the first delayed to performe, yet after diuers messages, the old King sending at the last a principall seruant of his to see the execution done, he was forced much against his will, to sée fulfilled.
               In these yonger yeares of Muley Sheck whilest this Basha was aliue, none of the Kings Sonnes was more dutifull to their Father then he, neither any of their actions so contented the old King as his; insomuch, the whole kingdomes hope for a successor after the old kings decease, was onely in Muley Sheck. Wherevpon and by the Kings voluntary motion, all the principall Alkeyds, and men of Commaund that were in his kingdomes, by solemne oath vowed allegeaunce to Muley Sheck, after the olde kings decease. And at that time Boferes the second Sonne, by reason of the great plague in Sus, and other discontents he receiued from that rebellious people, stayed not long there, but returned againe

to his Father in Moruecos, where he stayed with him vntill his Fathers departure to Fes in September 1602. Muley Sidan the third Sonne continued in Tedula, (a prouince fruitfull and scituate in the flat of Barbarie, the mid-way betwéene Fes, and Moruecos, as I haue told you,) who gouerned those parts in great peace and quietnes, euen in the cheife times of the tu

Howsoeuer, he carryed himselfe very dutifull to his Father, whilest he was liuing, yet from his Childehoode he was alwayes of an aspiring and ambitious nature, which could neuer be brought to subiect it selfe to giue any awefull respect to his elder brethren, but to hazard his whole estate in obtaining the Kingdome, accounting himselfe his Fathers lawfull heire, in that hee was his Fathers eldest Sonne, which he had by any of his marryed wiues: In this point not regarding the custome and lawe of the Mores, who in title of inheritance or succession, respect not the mother, whether shée be marryed Wife, or Concubine bought with money, so that her sonne be the eldest in birth.

And such was his la

                  ishing manner of spending and consuming of his Treasure, that in his

humors, hée neither regarded what hée gaue, nor to whome: in so much, that a Iew who was a Musitian, and vsed to play before him in his drunken fits, (what with the gifts giuen him by the Prince, and what else he gotte out of his house) had gotten together in money and iewels, (in the space of foure or fiue yeares) to the value of Foure Hundred Thousand Duckets, which is about fortie Thousand Pound sterling. This dissolute life and carelesse gouernment of Muley Sheck, gréeued the olde King not a little, especially to sée such a change or alteration in him, whose forwardnes in former times had béene the staye of his age, and had mooued him to cause the Alkeyds of the kingdome, by oath to confirme their allegeance after his owne death. Many wayes he sought to amend what was amisse in those parts, and to draw his Son to a more stricte course of life, and more carefull kind of gouernment, as well by his letters, as by sending diuers principall Alkeyds to be Counsellors vnto him. Yet such was the small accompt he made either of the one or the other; That the old King in the end séeing no amendment, but the estate of that Kingdome to grow dayly worse and worse, determined to go to Fes in his owne person with an armie, aswell to displace his Sonne who had denyed to come vnto him, vpon his sending for: as also to put in order all matters in those parts, which through the ill gouernment of his Sonne, were all out of frame. And so about the beginning of October 1602. he set forwards from Moruecos with an armie of Eight Thousand shot, and some fiue Thousand Horse towards Fes, leauing his second Sonne Muley Boferes to gouerne Moruecos, and Sus in his absence, vntill his returne; making such spéedy iourneyes, that he was with his forces within one dayes iourney of Fes, before his Sonne Muley Sheck was certainly aduised of his setting forth from Moruecos. Who, when hee vnderstood of his fathers being so néere, and himselfe euery

                  ueledge of the place (which is much respected in that countrey) willed him to come forth, and submit himselfe to his mercy: But Muley Sheck refused either obstinate in not obeying, or fearefull he could not render a good accompt of his Twenty Fiue yeares gouernment in Fes. Wherefore Muley Hamet commaunded Mustefa a Basha of Sidans, though then in the olde Muleys seruice, to take thrée thousand men▪

                   perforce to enter the place, which he performed, bringing Sheck prisoner, and the rest of his company which were left aliue after the conflicte. The old man would in no wise admit him into his presence, but committed him to the charge and custody of Basha Iudar, one of greatest place about the King, who caryed Sheck to Mickanes a strong Garrison towne, and there remained vntill the time of his Fathers death, which was some fiue moneths after.
               The olde King in his iourney to Fes, against his eldest sonne, passed by the Prouince of Tedula, and from thence tooke alongst with him his third son Muley Sidan, whom he commaunded to remoue his houshold to Fes, from Sidania, (a Citie which he had begunne to build in Tedula, and called it after his owne name) intending to leaue him Uizeroy of those parts, in the roome of his eldest sonne, whom he purposed to carrie with him from Mickanes, where he was prisoner, to Morruecos. Which he had also performed, if hee had not beene preuented by suddaine death: For in August 1603 hee hauing set all matters in order in those parts of Fes, prouiding for his returne to Morruecos, put out his Tents without Fes gates, but being abroad hee suddainly fell sicke, and his sicknesse so sore increased, that on Thursday falling sick,

on Sunday morning beeing the fourteenth of August 1603. he died.

And after his fathers death, he caused himselfe in Fes to bee proclaimed King of Barbarie, as lawfull heyre of his deceased father.

To whom shee dispéeded presently letters by one of the kings Eunuchs, who made such hast, that in foure dayes he came from Fes to his Tents, which were some two leagues from Morruecos, where he had lien all the Summer▪ before to auoyd the infection of the plague, which had béene that Summer in Morruecos, and with him was his younger brother Muley Nassar, and his eldest brothers sonne Muley Abdela.

But comming to the gates of the Citie, in companie with Muley Abdela his Nephew, being sonne to Muley Sheck, with whom hee was familiar, conferred with him about their flying into the Mountaines, perswading Muley Abdela that hee might no wayes put any trust in Boferes, since his father and he were the chiefest impediments, that hindered Boferes from claiming the Kingdome by course of iustice, his father Muley Sheck being the old Kings eldest sonne, and he the eldest sonne of his father: Besides, his father being in prison so neere Fes, where Muley Sidan was, it was to be doubted that Muley Sidan had alreadie gotten him into his power, and it might be, had made some agréement with him alreadie, to ioyne both against Muley Boferes: which if it should so fall out, would cause Boferes to deale more cruelly with him. But these perswasions moued not Abdela, who rather chose to enter the Citie, and follow his Uncle, on whose curtesie he would relie. Though Nassar fearing how Boferes would deale with him, with all speede fled into the Mountaines to the kindred of his mother, from whence after a few daies with some eight hundred, or a thousand of those people▪ whome he ioyned together, he passed into the plaines of

                  Sus, sending to the Alkeyd in Taradant to proclaime him King, or else to suffer him quietly to depart. But the Alkeyd hauing alreadie proclaimed Muley Boferes, withstood him, and he hauing no meanes wherewith to pay his souldiers and people that he had gathered togither, was soone left of all, & so returned againe to his mothers kindred, and liued priuatly there about seuen Moneths, and then dyed of the plague, or as some reported, secretly poysoned, was brought to Morruecos, and there buryed.

                  BUt to returne to Fes and those parts: after the death of the old King (Sidan being now proclaimed king in Fes, Boferes in Morruecos, & Sus; & Muley Sheck prisoner in Mickanes, in the keeping of Basha Iudar) the souldiers being abroad in their tents, without Fes gates, began to be in a mutenie, as well for sixtéene Moneths pay, which the old King owed them, as also about their returne to Morruecos, where the most of them had left their wiues and children. To appease this mutenie, Muley Sidan sent out of Fes vnto them Alkeyd Hamet Monsore, their chiefe Commaunder in the olde Kings time, to promise them as well content in payment, as also a speedie returne to Morruecos with Muley Sidan himselfe. But Monsore in stead of pacifying, laboured to encrease their mutenous humours, and at last agreed with them, suddainly in the night to take vp their tents, and to march with him to Morruecos, alleadging vnto them both the

vncertaintie of Muley Sidans pay, and the small likelyhoode of any speedie iourney he meant to take to Moruecos. And being to passe within a little of Mickanes, where the Basha kept Muley Sheck prisoner, hee wrote vnto the said Basha to know his intent, whether hee would goe to Moruecos or no, with him. To whom the Basha came, and brought Muley Sheck with him, whom they brought along as prisoner to Moruecos, and deliuered him vp to his brother Boferes, who kept him close prisoner in his house some 4. or 5. moneths, vntill the comming of Muley Sidan against him in battaile, by this meanes thinking to haue established the whole kingdome to Muley Boferes: who now, besides the possession of the city of Moruecos and his Fathers treasure, had brought vnto him y• greatest part of his Fathers forces,

He made likewise great preparations both of horse and foote in Fes, to bee alwaies ready, to accompany himselfe in person if néede should so require, hauing with him in Fes of principall Alkeids, Azus chéefe counsellor to the late deceased King, and Lord ouer his Bitlemel: Bocrasia, Absadiks, and diuers others.

Sidan vnderstanding what Iudar had done in Tedula, and likewise of the great preparations that his brother in Moruecos daily made to send out against him, forthwith put forth his tents, and ioyned together his whole forces, which were some eight or nyne Thousand shot, and some twelue Thousand horse, with two and twentie Péeces of Artillery, himselfe in person going along with them. And because he was altogether vnprouided of skilfull Gunners for his Ordinances, he procured from Salie out of certaine english men of warre, who at that instant were there, twoo english Gunners, to whome hee committed the charge of his Artillery, but by reason of much raine that had fallen, it being in the moneth of Ianuary 1604. the ground in many places was so soft, that they could not march with their Artillery so fast as néede required. So that his Artillery neuer came at the battaile, which was thought to be a chiefe cause of his ouerthrow.

                  red to trauell, and knowing it would be no small discouragement to his side, and encouragement to the other, that Sidan should be in perin the field, and no other his equall in bloud in his armie to withstand him) he concluded a colourable peace betwéene himselfe and his eldest brother Muley Sheck, whome vntill that time hee kept close prisoner in his house, agréeing with him that he should go forth into his armie, and ioyne with Iudar to fight against Muley Sidan, whome if he ouerthrow in battaile, he should enioy the kingdome of Fes, and so much of those Casterne parts of Barbarie, as he enioyed in their Fathers time: On condition that at his enterance into Fes, hee should proclaime Muley Boferes King, and himselfe onely Uizeroy, & so should stil acknowledge his Gouernment there, as deriued from Boferes: And to the intent Muley Sheck should the better obserue these conditions according to their agréement, hee was to leaue his eldest sonne in

pawne with Muley Boferes in Moruecos. On these plausible conditions, Muley Sheck was set at libertie, a happy turne for himselfe as he thought, who neuer looked for any better but perpetuall imprisonment with much misery. But the truth is Basha Iudar had secret aduertisement from his Master Boferes (yet not so secret, but it was knowne to Muley Sheck, and closely carryed of him by interception of letters betwixpt Moruecos and the campe in Tedula:) That he should abridge Muley Sheck of any commaund in the campe, or matter of counsell in ordering of the fight, onely shew him to the souldiers vnder his canopy, that the Fezes who were the strength of Sidans armie, might know Sheck was in the campe of Boferes, whome they loued in regard partly of his long ab

                  de amongst them, but especially of his great liberality, or rather prodigality, formerly shewed vnto them, which wrought much in their minds at the ensuing battaile: And withall the Basha had a speciall charge sent, and his Guard so to watch him, that (if he got the battaile) he should bring Muley Sheck in yrons as safe a prisonner from the campe to Moruecos, as once hee had done from Mickanes. But this being discouered, Muley Sheck so shufled his game, that though Iudar wonne the field, Muley Sheck escaped vnto Fes, and was louingly entertainted of the citizens, proclaiming himselfe King of Barbarie. But returne we to the Fokers, treating about conditions of peace in Fes with Muley Sidan, who by intelligence vnderstoode from Moruecos of the fresh supplies of souldiers, daily sent out by his brother to the Basha, whereby hee greatly suspected those offers of peace, to be but a deuise to prolonge the time whilest his whole forces were in a readines, and then sudenly to haue come vpon him vnawares before he should be prouided for him. And therefore hee returned the Fokers with denials of the 
                     •…
                  ffered conditions of peace, and himselfe thinking to take the oportunity and aduantage of y•
                  
time before either his brothers new forces should come to the Basha, or Muley Sheck his eldest brother be set at liberty. He caused with all diligence to be gotten together some two thousand Mules and horses, and vpon euery Mule to be set two souldiers with their furniture, and so (without any stay for the rehalling of tents, or carrying along of his Artillery with him) to bee with all hast possible sent and ioyned to the Almohalla of Alkeid

But this pollicy of his herein tooke no place, for Muley Sheck after he was set at liberty, made such spéedy iourneyes that he came to y• 
                  Almohalla of the Basha, before y• 
                  Muley Sidan had certain intelligence of his liberty, and yet he entered the Almohalla but on the Tuesday, the battaile being fought vpon the Fryday following. Muley Sidan vnderstanding for certaine that his eldest brother was come into the Basha his Almohalla, thought it no time for him to deferre giuing of battile, least it shold be knowne amongst his souldiers, (many of whome in former times had serued the sayd Muley Sheck.) And therefore on Fryday the sixt of Ianuary 1604. the forces of each side met and ioyned together, betwéen whom there was no long fight, for vppon the discharging of foure Péeces of Artillery, (which Iudar Basha had with him) some 3 or 4 times, a great part of the souldiers of Muley Sidan beganne to flye: except some choyce men which were in that part of the battaile where the Muley himselfe was: by reason of y• resolution of their Commaunder,

After his foure Moneths abode in Saphie, wherein his bountie was extraordinarie, not to his Country men onely, but to Flemish, French and Spanish, admired of his souldiers, hee was receiued into Morruecos with great state, hauing by the way, as also during his abode in Saphie, diuerse letters from the King, extolling his honourable endeuours, and approued valiantnesse in his farr

Being come into the Kings presence, his Letters of credite were receyued, with great shewe of

kindnesse, and himselfe entertained with all gracious respect, not onely at the Kings hands, but of the principallest men in office or fauour about the Court, and so for that time was dismissed, the chiefest men attending him backe to the place where he tooke horse. Some fiue dayes after, sir Anthonie Sherley comming to audience, and thinking to haue ridden in as he did before a chaine was hung crosse the entrance of the Mushward, which he perceyuing onely done to hinder his passage, would not alight from his horse, but returned backe verie discontented. This being certified to Boferes, presently three of his chiefest Alkeyds were sent to qualifie the matter. But sir Anthonie tooke the disgrace not as his owne, but his whose person he represented, telling the Alkeyds, his maister the Emperour, was able & would requite the iniury, neither did he feare, though now within the power of Boferes, knowing the greatnesse of him in whose seruice hee was imployed, so farre surpassing the King of Morruecos, as maugre the proudest he would be fetched from thence, and bee fully renenged of the least iniurie done vnto him. The three Alkeyds layde the blame vpon the Kings Porter, offering sir Anthonie the Porters head if he would haue it, so spending an houre to pacifie his choller, and bring him backe, the Porter before his face was sore beaten and imprisoned, neither euer after was he hindered of riding thorow the Mushward.
               
               During his abode in Morruecos, which was fiue moneths, Boferes and he had diuerse priuate conferences, as it was generally thought, which way to keepe him in the Kingdome against his two brethren, Sheck and Sidan; as also to giue the great L

These

two had beene captines in Morruecos almost 16. yeares, the one, Sonne to the Uiceroy of the East Indies, the other of a noble house in Portingal. The first had his resgat thrise sent for to ransom him out of the East Indies, but twise it was taken by the English, once by Flemings during our late watres with them: the other, his brethren driue him of for his res

To accompanie him from the Court to Saphie was sent one of the Kings Gentlemen Ushers, to whom at his parting he threw him his Hat which hee wore, from his head, with a Iewell of great value, rewarding largely all the Ushers followers. For his guard (the wayes being then very daungerous) was sent downe with him, foure hundred shot, vnder the commaund of Alkeyd Abdela Sinko, a Portingall re negado, (which is a Christian turned Moore.)

marched to Moruecos with his troupes being some ten Thousand horse and foote, besides his christian Marriners, whose helpe wonne him the field, fought some sixe myles southeast from Moruecos, on the eight of December 1606. Sheck bore his Sonne company no farther then Salie, from whence three houres riding is a riuer called Mamora, into which bay the Italian Shippes put in: Sheck went thither, and hard by the Shippes vppon the shoare pitched his Tent wherein he lay, part of his treasure béeing shipped, himselfe determining there to stay, and expect the euent of his Sonne, if it passed well with him, then Affricke should hold him, otherwise to visite the great Duke of Thuscane, on whose courtesie he much rested. But the christian Gunners so well obserued their times of shooting and placing their Ordinance, as they gotte Abdela the field, hoping thereby to haue obtained both libertie, and pillage, of which most of them poore men fayled▪ as afterward you shall read.
               When Sheck heard Abdela had gotte Moruecos, hee grew careles to send prouision or supplie the wants of his thrée Italian Shippes, wherefore they set saile from Mamora homewards, taking such treasure for their pay as were in their custodies. Boferes lost in this battaile about Sir Hundred men, fled into the Citie to saue his treasure and his women, but for feare of being surprised, durst not tarry to take his treasure away with him, but in all hast poasted toward the Mountaines, willing the Alkeids and chiefest men of his court to bring it after him, with the rich Swo

men perceiuing, being encouraged, and too eager of the chase, some Thousand Horse galloped before their own Ordinance, and followed their enemie close to Sidans campe, their Péeces of Artillary being drawne after them. Muley Sidan well knowing the aduantage of the place, séeing his enemies depriued of the benefit of their great Ordinance, which he most feared, encouraged his men to kéepe their ground, and bringing with his owne person fresh supplies to second them, gaue his aduersaries the Abdelians so hotte a charge, that they were faine to retire in great disorder, vpon the mouths of their owne Artillary. This dis array perceiued by the Christian Gunners, it put them in minde to discharge vppon their owne men the Abdelians, holding it better to kill Fiue or Sixe Hundred of their owne side, then to loose the battaile. But the More, who was Captaine ouer the Canoniers and other Commaunders, would not suffer it: Wherefore the Sidanians following in good order, and very close, fell to the execution with their swords, surprised the Artillery, and flew the men. The slaughter continued some foure houres, betwixt seauen or eight Thousand killed, and fewe to speake on left aliue, for what the souldiers spared, the Citizens in reuenge of their disorders, pillages, and villanies done to their women, bereaued them of their liues, who being dead were not suffered to bée buried, but lay aboue the ground as a prey to the dagges and sowles of the ayre. Heauie likewise was the Conquerors hand vppon the Christians which tooke Abdelas part, most of them for their fiue moneths seruice to Abdela, were either slaine in the fury of battaile, or after had his throat cut. And this was the ende of them, who had liued in the streights of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean Sea, not as Marchants by honest trading, but hauing committed spoyle vpon diuers Seafaring men, felt the bloody hande of a barbarous Nation, (as a deserued punishment sent

from God) to execute iustice for their manifold committed wrongs and outrages.
               This battaile▪ being lost with the greatest bloodshed that any hath béen since these warres beganne, Muley Abdela fledde to Fes, a Hundred persons of his whole armie not left aliue to beare him company: And Sidan Maister of the field, entered the Citie of Mor

For the Kings house being Castle wise builded, and seuered from the Citty with a defencible and a stronge wall, lacking no kind of munition for the defence thereof, had within it, besides souldeirs of Morruecos, three Thousand Fezees who were not at the last battaile, but left there to guard the place for Abdela.
               
               These presuming on their owne valour and strength of the place, denyed to render it vppon any tearmes to Sidan, though they were sollicited, during the space of twoo dayes, by all faire meanes therevnto: Sidan bringing his Artillary to the walles, yet delayed as loath to deface a building so strong, costly, and beautifull; So that in the meane time a Captaine whose house ioyned to the wall, by stealth with Fiue Hundred men, scaled and wonne the top of the wall, crying, victory

                  Muley Sidan vpon this, sent Basha Seleman, willing them to deliuer vp their Armes, with promise they shuld be pardoned, which presently they did, yéelding and deliuering both swords and peeces. Thus disarmed, they séely soules came forth, when presently after, message came from the King to butcher and cut the throates of

them'all, which was executed. A pittifull matter in my iudgement, so many men yeelding vpon good composition, after furie of battaile, vpon cold blood to be made so pittifull a spectacle: it was bootlosse for them to alledge either law or reason in defence of their liues, such is the miserie & slauerie of that people, whose goods and liues lieth alwayes in the will of the King, either to saue, or destroy at his pleasure. Some colour Sidan had for his tyrannie, thinking these Fezees would neuer be woonne wholy to be his, but vpon fit time, and euerie little occasion reuolt from him: Secondly, he ment to requite Abdela lege Talionis, for putting so many commaunders to death, prizing euerie one of their liues, worth thrée hundred common souldiers.

Abdela something animated with their offers, yet delayed, knowing his forces farre inferior vnto Sidans, vntill still vrged by the Shracies which had brought from the mountaines some store of their kindred, verie able and resolute men to his ayde, he set forwards about the latter end of August towards Morruecos, determining to giue battaile once more to Muley Sidan.

                     MMuley Sidan was verie strong, for beside his owne souldiers, the Morruecans ayded him with eight thousand men, and diuers tribes sent supplies to augment his forces. Hee had twoo hundred English, the most of them voluntaries, sixtie field peeces, with sufficient shot and powder. Ouer the English and all the Christians was generall Captaine Iohn Giffard a Gentleman of a worthy spirit, and discended from the auncient and honourable stemme of the Giffards in Buckinghamshire.

Upon his first entertainment and welcome into the countrey; Sidan bestowed vpon him a rich sword, valued at a thousand marks, and a scarlet cloake, richly imbrodered with Pearle, sent as a present to Muley Hamet, the Kings father, from our late soueraigne of famous memorie Quéene Elizabeth, besides manie other extraordinarie fauours of good value, and often conuersing familiarly, yea, sometimes visiting Captaine Giffard at his owne Tent. His entertainment was twentie fiue shillings per diom, besides many supplies proceeding from the Kings bountie. With him as secondarie men in charge, was one maister Philip Giffard, his neare and verie deare kinsman, Captaine Iaques a verie valiant souldier, captaine Smith one of the most exquisite enginers in Europe, captaine Baker an ancient Brytaine souldier, captaine Tailer, captaine Faukes, captaine Chambers, captaine Isack, men euerie way able to vndergoe their seuerall commaunds. These were dayly stipendaries at twelue shillings a man, except the two sea captaines, Isack, and Chambers, who had foure shillings a day, and euerie common souldier twelue pence truly payed them. These preparations considered, Muley Sidan had small reason to leaue the field, or feare Abdelas forces, being nothing in respect of his.

               Sidan being gone, as loath to tarry, spend bloud, and

winne a field, Abdela got the ground his enemyes marched vppon, but no great victory, entered Morruecos without applause or reioyce of the Citizens, some yet feeling his late done iniuryes, sory for the losse of Sidan, who had prooued a Tyrant, nor welcomming Abdela vpon hope of amendment, but with policy and patience fitted themselues to the misery of the time: Abdela once againe Maister of Moruecos, got the Kings house, but found no treasure to reléeue his wants, great were his promises to rewarde the Shraceis with bounty, and enrich his followers. When the Citty was recouered, now hée hauing it, there fayled of his expectation, and his souldiers lacking both meat and money: yet to kéepe them still in hope, and so in gouernment, it was bruited the yong King had found a well full of treasure within the house which Muley Hamet Xarif had layed vp for a deare yeare, but this good newes quicklye vanished, the Well not yéelding water to refresh their fainting stomacks. Therefore the Shraceis hauing released their kindred, recouered their wiues and children, which had escaped the fury and bloody decrée of Sidan the last King, they tooke good words and kind vsages of Abdela in lieu of payment, séeing Moruecos neither afforded them meat nor Abdelas fortune further maintenance, and so Thrée Thousand of them departed at one time. Muley Abdela with the restdue of his forces kept Moruecos, labouring by all possible meanes to giue his souldiers content, and kéepe them together, so with much a

                  BUT whilest Abdela and Sidan were contriuing their owne ends, there arised a storme in the Mountaines which fell in the plainēs of Moruecos, the tempest driuer was one Muley Hamet Bosonne, cosine to the thrée brethren which haue striuen for the kingdome. This man gathering treasure, and temporising with them all thrée, so played their game, that finding their weaknes which these quarrels had brought them vnto, vppon a suddaine séeing his time went into the Mountaines to his mothers kindred, mustered very neare 20. thousand able men, the Muley being well prouided of treasure, gaue them due pay and large, winning them to his respect & seruice, so that in lesse then two moneths space, hée gotte all thinges in readines, descended from the Tessevon Mountaines towards Moruecos.
               
               This news brought to Abdela was very vnwelcome, yet (calling his wittes and councell together) it was concluded considering the Shraceis were gone, his remnant of souldiers féeble and out of heart, and the Moruecans daily fled to Hamet Bosonne, whose vprising like a blazing starre drew their eyes vppon him, that Abdela should trauell to Fes, which he might well doe without a guide, hauing heretofore vppon like necessities, often measured the myles: And though he was determined so to doe, yet a small occasion hastened his iourney, for

some myle from Abdelas campe, vpon a hill on the backside of Morruecos, a man being séen with a speare in his hand, and a white linnen vppon it as a flagge. Abdela thought Hamet Bosonne to be with his whole forces behinde the hill, when hee was a full daies march from Moruecos: Therfore in all hast he tooke vp some of his tens, but the greater part left standing in a manner, being feared, ranne away. And afterward when this matter was discouered, which Abdela held a token of his surprise, it was nothing else but a poore More washing his napery, and for the spéedier drying vsed this meanes which terrifyed Abdela from the seate of his Empire, to Fes the safest place for his abode.
               
                  Lylla Isha Sidans Mother hearing of Hamet Bosonnes approach, was perswaded his mouements were onely to defend her Sonnes right, knowing Bosonne of late fauoured Sidans title, comming into his pay, and in person seruing the Muley at the last battaile when Sidan fled into Sus. Herevppon shée sent diuers captaines, part of her owne Guard, others of her freinds and kindred to his ayde, thinking he would haue taken Moruecos for Sidan. But Bosonne hauing entered the Citie peaceably, proclaymed himselfe King, dismissed all Sidans fauourers, which were not willing to bee his seruants, who returned to their Lady Mistresse, certifying her error and their successe: his treasure he imparted largely to his followers, by strong hand desired no mans seruice, but those who were willing▪ Some thirtie english men remayning, wearie of their sustained misery, and the state of the country, he gaue them licence to imbarke, and writte to the Gouernour of Saphia to giue them their passe, notice whereof being giuen to the Factor Marine, for the English he disparted them into diuers Shippes with all conueniency, though to his cost and charges charity to helpe the distressed soules, and loue to his natiue country, moouing him there vnto. This

                  Muley Hamet Bosonne during the time of his gouernment was a very good and iust man, offered no discourteste, or tooke away any mans goods, but payed the marchants trulie for the same, who liked well his currant and true dealing.
               
                  Bosonnes Mother hearing her Sonne was setled in Morruecos, brought what strength shée could from the Mountaines, and in her way knowing Boferes lodged in a fortresse, whervnto he was fled, not to be well guarded, shée beset the house, meaning to take the Muley prisoner, who being doyde of meanes to resist in the night, made a hole through the wall and so escaped priuately to Salie, a Porte Towne within the iurisdiction of his Brother Sheck, where at this day he remaineth.
               On the morrow betimes, Bosonnes mother with her men entered the fort, mi

But an Empyre ill got, is seldome séene of long continuance, for within lesse than two moneths, Muley Sidan came out of Sus with a great army, for whose ayde Lylla Isha sould her Iewels, and Plate, to furnish her Sonne with Swords, Pykes, Horsemen, Staues, and other war-like munition.
               On the other side Hamet Bosonne prepared to welcome his cousine the Muley Sidan; so about the beginning of Aprill 1608. both their forces met hard by Morruecos where a chiefe of a kindred one Grufe which came out of Sus, a great wyne drinker, alwaies a fauourer of Muley Sidan (though little valuing any of the thrée kings) presuming vppon his owne strength and valour, desired the honour that hée might giue charge vppon the enemy with fiue Hundred Horse which was his owne regiment, and of his owne kindred: Sidan refused to graunt him his request, therefore the Casima tooke his

owne leaue and gaue the enemy a full charge vppon the body of his army, which receauing him very brauely, the Casima and his company were in great danger to bée ouerthrowen: but Sidan to reléeue him, sent fiue Hundred Horsemen of his owne: so with these Thousand, the Casima broke the ran

                   of Bosonnes battalions, then with their sables fell to execution, vntil the whole campe séeing the field lost, fled towards the Mountaines: thus Sidan without further resistance entering Morruecos, resting there in quiet thrée moneths, vntill Hamet Boson recouering now forces in Iuly following, presented himselfe before the Citie, trusting as well vppon his owne strength, as the loue of the Citizens: hoping his good and gentle vsage when hee was amongst them, would haue bred a liking in them, of his milde and gentle gouernment: but either the seruile minde of the multitude little respected his fore-passed kindnesse, or the feare of Sidan made them loath to shewe any signe of good will, for at his approach no man in the Citie was knowen to drawe a Swoord in his defence. So on the eight of Iuly Bosonne was discomfited with the losse of some Thousand men, fledde to the mountaines, where within foure dayes after Alkeid Azus got him poysoned, hoping thereby to winne the fauour of Muley Sidan.
               
               This Azus is aged and subtill, by his long experience best knoweth the secrets of that state, was brought vp vnder Abdela, Muley Hamet Xarifs Brother, and for his counsell to Abdela, willing him

When old Hamet dyed, he was in his campe neare Fes, and after his death rested all his loue vpon Muley Sidan (holding him the prime man and fittest of the thrée brethren, to rule the Kingdome,) vntill both he and Sidy Imbark could not counsell and rule Muley Sidan, for his owne good and benefit of the common weale, being headstronge, and would take no mans counsell but to his owne liking and hurt, therefore Sedy Abdela Imbark went to his contemplation at Aca: And Azus to a castle in the Mountaines, which hée had stored with treasure against a storme, or to refresh the winter of his age, from whence he will not come downe, vntill he sée some hope of peace, hauing at this instant more treasure in his Coffers, then all the three Brethren besides, and hopeth to kéepe it beeing in the middest of his friends and kindered, and in a place as well fortified as any in Barbarie.

And Iohn Etina was promised for his labour in this businesse, and bringing it to effect, vppon the deliuery of the Porte Townes, to haue yearely paied him Twoo Thousand Duckets during his life. In Iune last past, this matter was first mooued, since which time in the latter end of August, as my author telleth mée, seauen Gallions, and the Gallies of Naples, in all a hundred sayle, well manned with store of pyoners to raise forts, went to Allaroche, thinking to bee receaued, but Thirtie Thousand Alarbees came downe to the shore, not allowing any such neighborhoode, though they holde the Andelusian halfe their bloud. It is reported the Gouernour offered them the keyes of Allaroche, if they would land: but tolde them they came somewhat to soone before matters were ripe, or could bee effected as Sheck did desire for the King of Spaines benefite.
               Thus are they returned missing of their designes, and for this yeare likely to fayle of making their Maister the onely Commander of both sides the streights of Gybraltar. Whether Sir Anthonie Sherley was ymployed in this seruice, it is not certainely knowen▪ some are of opinion that he was induced therevnto, because they haue formerly hearde the King of Spaine hath royally rewarded him for his trauailes with Boferes, by giuing him the places and pay of two Captaines in the Indies, made him Admirall of the Leuant Seas, and next in place to the Uizeroy of Naples, hauing for his entertaynment Fiue Hundred Duckets a moneth: without question hee knoweth well the state of that vnciuill and barbarous Nation, hauing an apprehending and admirable witte to conceaue the disposition of

any people with whom he shall conuerse, whilest he was amongst them, he behaued himselfe very well toward ye better sort, winning credit with them, & gayning y• loue of the poorer sort excéedingly, by his larges (for if a More or slaue gaue him but a dish of Dates, hée should receiue a reward as from an Emperour) & howsoeuer some may holde this a vice, counting him a lauisher: yet by this meanes he came to the knowledge of that which otherwise hee neuer should haue attained vnto. The more credible fame is, sir Anthonie was not with this Fléete, therefore they sped neuer the better, for had hee béene in company, and had commaund, hee would either haue taken footing, or ventured all, scorning to returne with doing nothing, and so bee laughed at. This may bee a caueat for great men, not to vndertake great matters & exployts, but vppon certaine ground and weighty reason, for else the enuious eye of the world looking vppon them, and marking their actions, will deride, if they sée them faile in their enterprizes.

               THE false Prophet Mahomet, calling to counsell a Iew and a Fryer to make his lawe, extracted out of the olde lawe what he found for his liking: and likewise, preuerted places in the newe Testament, which by a wrong and sinfull wresting, might séeme fit for his purpose. Out of these two and the fancies of his own braine, the Deuill being Register, Mahomet compiled his Alcaron: to please the Iew hee tolde him Moses was Cillim Vlla, that is, the word of God, because hee spake to the Israelites as God commanded him. To winne fauour with the Fryer, hee confessed our Sauiour Christ was of great off éeme, calling him Sedy Nysa, and with all sayd he was Rohala, that is, the breath of God, borne of the Uirgine Marie after a strange fashion, whome he called Lylla Mariam, but not incarnate: Confessed that of her was borne a Prophet to saue the world, to whome all should haue giuen eare, and haue belieued. But the Iewes (before he had finished the woorke of our saluation) would not

heare. but sought to crucifie him. Wherevpon Christ seeing the Iewes so obstinate, ascended vp into heauen, putting another man in his place to bee crucified, whom

            Their false Prophet Mahomet, whom they call Rosulla, that is the Messenger of God, was but a Larbee as they were, but God gaue vnto him power and vnderstanding, to make an end of the Law, which the Iewes would not suffer Christ to doe: and most blasphemously alledge, that place in the sixteenth of saint Iohns Gospel, to be meant of Mahomet, Expedit vobis vt ego vadam, si enim non abiero, paracletus non veniet advos; si autem abiero, mittam

Therefore if any doubt, he must goe to the Priest called Talby, and of him be resolued. Smal learning maketh a Talby, which is onely to learne the Alcoran without booke, and it is thus learned: First, he bath written him a lesson vpon a boord like vnto a hornbooke, when he hath learned that Memoriter, then is it wiped out, and a new written, which beeing learned without booke

            Circumcision they vse, and a kinde of Baptisme, but at their owne houses, not in the Churches, because women vsed about the Lauature, may not enter the Sinagogue: first, because of their often vncleannesse, secondly, for their offence, because Eue incited Adam to

therefore the Moore when a sonne or daughter is borne, the eight vay after their birth, the parents send for a Talby, and some old men and women, where after a fewe prayers said, the women wash the childe all ouer with water, and so giue the name, making a banket according to the mans abilitie, but it may be, the child shall not bee circumcised of two, three, or eight yeares after, according as the father doth thinke good, for then he maketh great bankets: and vsually to saue cost, hath a child marryed, or some of his kindred vpon that day.
            They haue foure principall feasts. The Easter which is calld Rumedan, preceding this feast is their Lent, about the constitution of which, their Prophet finding it hard to fast fortie dayes together, abated them tenne, so they fast but thirtie, yet is it verie hard, for after day breaketh, they take no manerof suste

And once the same Gentleman trauailing to Morruecos with certaine Moores in his companie in their time of Lent, one of the Moores being thirstie with heate and trauaile, went to a Conduit in the streetes of Moruecos to drink a little water: but the people so wondered at him, and reuiled the poore slaue, crying out hee knew not God, for breaking in publique their Lawe, (though it doth admit one may breake the fast for great necessitie a day or two in his trauaile, so hee take vpon his conscience to fast as many dayes as hee hath missed,

before the next Rumedan come againe) that the poore slaue seeing himselfe condemned of his owne people, and dishonoured before the Christian trauailers, in a desperate minde (which may be counted zeale) killed himselfe with his owne dagger. The Iewes in that Countrey obserue a Lent, in remembrance of their fortie yeares iourney in the Wildernesse, but diuide the forty dayes of this their Lent equally, into euery moneth some.
            Their second feast called Lidlaber, celebrated about our Whitsontide, is kept in remembrance of Abrahams obedience, in sacrificing his sonne Isaac, therefore the Moore be he poore or rich, for himselfe, and for euerie sonne he hath, will buy a shéepe against the day, when euery one must kill his shéepe with his owne hands. And the King both the like, slaying one with his owne hand, turning the head into the East. The Iewes in their Church or Synagogue, thrée or foure times when they are at praiers,

            Their third feast is like to our Michaelmasse, called Lashour, which the Iewes kéepe as the feast of Tabernacles. The Moore celebrateth it after his Inning of Corne and fruits. The King maketh vse of this positiue Law, strengthning it with his authoritie, as also with the habite and cloake of Religion and conscience, thereby to make his subiect, pay the tenths (due to bee payed at that time) of all his corne and cattle, both young and old, with greater alacritie: All which commeth vnto the Kings coffers. Like wise at this time the common people should pay the tenth of their money to the poore and Church: something indéed they giue, but if the King bée payed, y• oftentimes is winked at, their Church hauing no command to compell y• laitie to pay their due: for the
