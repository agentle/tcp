            The Ile of Gulls.
            
               ¶. Enter ſeuerally 3. Gentlemen, as to ſee a play.
               
                  1
                  HOw now gallants, what iſt? what iſt?
               
               
                  2
                  The Ile of Gulls.
               
               
                  3
                  The Ile of Gulls, what ſhould that be?
               
               
                  2
                  A play by the name, but come ſhals quarter our ſelues?
               
               
                  1
                  If ſome had had the wit to doe ſo in time, they might ha ſaude
the hangman a labour. But come boy, furniſh vs with ſtooles.
               
               Enter Prologue.
               
                  Prol.
                  Pardon me ſir, my office is to ſpeake a Prologue, not to prouide
you ſtooles.
               
               
                  1
                  And you were the Epilogue to ſir-
               
               
                  2
                  Fie be not inciuill: doſt heare youth, prethe whats he that diſcouerd
your new found Land, the Ile of Gulls? what is hee?
               
               
                  Prol.
                  A meere ſtranger ſir.
               
               
                  3
                  A ſtranger? the better welcome: comes hee Eaſt-ward,
Weſt-ward, or North-ward hoe?
               
               
                  Prol.
                  None of the three waies I aſſure you.
               
               
                  1
                  Prethe where is he?
               
               
                  Prol.
                  Not on his knees in a corner, to Apollo praying that his play
may hold in a good hand at Paſſadge, not on the ſtage amongſt gallants,
preparing a beſpoke Plaudite; but cloſe in his ſtudie writing
hard, to get him a handſome ſuite againſt Sommer.
               
               
                  2
                  And where ſits his friends? hath he not a prepard company of
gallants, to aplaud his ieſts, and grace out his play.
               
               
                  Prol.
                  None I proteſt: Doe Poets vſe to beſpeake their Auditory.
               
               
                  2
                  The beſt in grace doe, and but for that, ſome that I know, had
neuer had their grace in Poetry till this day.
               
               
                  Prol.
                  Then muſt our Author looke for a certaine diſgrace, for he
is altogether vnfurniſht of ſuch a friendly audience.
               
               
                  1
                  Then he muſt lay his tryall vpon God and good wits. But why
doth he call his play The Ile of Gulls, it begets much expectation.
               
               
                  Prol.
                  Not out of any dogged diſpoſition, not that it figures a
                        〈…〉
                     
certaine ſtate, or priuate gouernment: farre be that ſuppoſition 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     
the thought of any indifferent Auditor: and the argument beeing a
little ſtring or Riuolet, drawne frō the full ſtreine of the right worthy
Gentleman, Sir Phillip Sydneys well knowne Archadea, confirmes
it: onely a Duke to make tryall of certaine experiments, retyres
with his retinue into a Nameleſſe deſart. Now as well for faſhion
ſake, as that all thoſe which haue to doe in that deſart, are guld in
the reach of their hopes, therefore hee calls it, (and as hee preſumes,
not improperlie) The Ile of Gulls.
                  
               
               
                  1
                  Out a queſtion he hath promiſed thee ſome fee, thou pleadeſt
ſo hard for him, but and he be a right Poet hee will neuer performe
it. But what method obſerues hee in his play, iſt any thing Criticall?
Are Lawyers fees, and Cittizens wiues laid open in it: I loue to heare
vice anotomizd, & abuſe let blood in the maiſter vaine, is there any
great mans life charactred int?
               
               
                  Pro.
                  None I proteſt ſir, only in the perſon of Dametas he expreſſes
to the life the monſtrous and deformed ſhape of vice, aſwell to
beget a lothing of abuſe, as that his villanie may giue the greater luſter
to the vertuous diſpoſitions of true-borne gentilitie.
               
               
                  1
                  All thats nothing to mee, and there be not Wormewood water
and Copperes int, Ile not like it, ſhould Apollo write it, and Roſius
himſelfe act it.
               
               
                  2
                  Fie vpon thee, thou art too too Criticall: is there any good baudry
int, ieſts of an ell deepe, and a fathome broad, good cuckolding,
may a couple of young-ſetters vp learne to doe well int? Giue me a
ſceane of venery, that will make a mens ſpirrits ſtand on theyr typtoes,
and die his bloode in a deepe ſcarlet, like your Ouids Ars Amandi,
there flowes the true Spring-head of Poetry, and the verie
Chriſtall fount of Parnaſſus.
               
               
                  Prol.
                  Chaſt eares would neuer endure it ſir.
               
               
                  2
                  Chaſt eares, now deafenes light vppon em, what ſhould chaſt
eares doe at a play.
               
               
                  3
                  Tis ſtrange now, I am of neither a both your opinions, I like
neither rayling nor baudry: no, giue mee a ſtately pend hiſtorie, as
thus, The rugged windes, with rude and ragged ruffes. &c.
                  
               
               
                  2
                  Fie vpont, meere Fuſtian; I had rather heare two good baudie
ieſts, then a whole play of ſuch teare-cat thunderclaps.
               
               
                  Prol.
                  Alas Gentlemen, how iſt poſsible to content you? you will

                        〈◊〉
                      rayling, and inuectiues, which our Authour neither dares, nor

affects: you baudy and ſcurrill ieſts, which neither becomes his modeſtie
to write, nor the eare of a generous Auditory to heare: you
muſt ha ſwelling compariſons, an
                        •
                      bumbaſt Epithites, which are as
fit for the body of a C
                        •••
                     edie, as Hercules ſhooe for the foote of a
Pygmey: yet all theſe we muſt haue, and all in one play; or tis alreadie
condemnd to the hell of eternall diſgrace.
               
               
                  1
                  Looke toot, if there be not gall int, it ſhall not paſſe.
               
               
                  2
                  If it be not baudie, tis impoſsible to paſſe.
               
               
                  3
                  If it be both Criticall and baudy, if it be not high written, both
your Poet and the houſe to, looſe a friend of me.
               
               
                  Prol.
                  Nay I beſeech you ſir, if you be his friend, ſtand ſo to him
ſtill, for he hath too many enemies already, in whoſe iudgements, he
and his labours ſtand excommunicate, as though vnworthy to preſent
themſelues in this aſſembly.
               
               
                  1
                  Enemies, nays foote then theres ſome hope in's play, for Enuie
neuer workes but againſt deſert and merrit. If hee be enuied theres
ſome worth in him, and Ile ſee out his play for that onely.
               
               
                  2
                  Faith and Ile ſee an act or two out, but I tell you afore-hand I
cannot ſee it out.
               
               
                  3
                  Not ſee it out? your reaſon.
               
               
                  2
                  Fore God I lay in bed till paſt three a clock, ſlept out my dinner,
and my ſtomacke will toule to ſupper afore fiue, therefore you
muſt pardon me.
               
               
                  Prol.
                  Either ſee it all or none; for tis growne into a cuſtome at
playes, if any one riſe (eſpecially of any faſhionable ſort) about what
ſerious buſines ſoeuer, the reſt thinking it in diſlike of the play, tho
he neuer thinks it, cry mew, by Ieſus vilde; and leaue the poore hartleſſe
children to ſpeake their Epilogue to the emptie ſeates.
               
               
                  3
                  Why dooſt thinke thy audience like a flock of ſheepe, that one
cannot leape ouer a hedge, but all the reſt will follow, they ha more
of reaſon in them then ſo.
               
               
                  2
                  Well, Ile ſit out the play, and be but to auoyd that ſheepiſh imputation,
but ſee it be baudy, or by this light I and all my friends will hiſſe.
               
               
                  Prol.
                  You ſhould not deale gentleman-like with vs els.
               
               
                  Prologue.
                  The miſerie that waites vpon the pen
                  Of the beſt Writers, iudge it gentlemen,
                  Let them expreſſe the very ſoule of wit,
                  
                     
And want Opinions voice to countnance it,
                  Tis like the idle buzzing of a flie,
                  Heard, not regarded: wretched Poetrie:
                  If a write mirth, tis Rybaldry, and meane,
                  Scornd of chaſt eares. If he compoſe a Sceane
                  Of high writ Poeſie, fitting a true ſtage,
                  Tis counted fuſtian: If portick rage
                  Strike at abuſe, or ope the vaine of ſinne,
                  He is ſtraight inform'd againſt for libelling.
                  Neither quick mirth, inuectiue, nor high ſtate,
                  Can content all: ſuch is the boundleſſe hate
                  Of a confuſed Audience: Then we
                  That ſcarcely know the rules of Poeſie
                  Cannot ſcape check. Yet this our comfort is,
                  The wiſe will ſmile to heare th' impartiall hiſſ.
                  We neither bragge, nor tremble, faint nor intreat,
                  Our merrits nothing, yet our hopes are great,
                  Yet this our Author bad me boldly ſpeake,
                  His play ſhall paſſe, let Enuie ſwell and breake,
                  Detraction he ſcornes, honours the beſt,

               Exit.

                  ¶Enter Baſilius, Gynetia, Hipolita, Violetta, Lord attendants.
                  
                     Baſil:
                     Welcom gallants, welcom honord bloods; the reaſon that
we haue vncloth'd vs of our princely gouernment in Arcadia, and
haue to doe with this priuate retirement heere in this defart Ile, you
ſhall find in that ſhedule, onely thus much for publique ſatisfaction:
Tis not ſtrange to you, that the choiſeſt treaſure Nature indow'd vs
with, is mynde vp in the vaines of my two daughters: howe much
their quiet, and the ſmothe ſtreame of our gouernment in Arcadia,
was troubled by the impetuous concourſe of vnruly ſuters, is familiar
with your knowledge; this to auoide, I haue for my Image there in
my abſence appointed my brother, and vndertooke this priuate retirement.
                  
                  
                     Gy.
                     Why my lord, are you ſo couetous of your daughters beauties,
that their perfections ſhall be a meanes to hinder their preferment?
                  
                  
                     Baſi.
                     Rather to further it faire Queene: they are the onely pearles
of our age, and to ſee them well ſet in honourable and wel-befitting
                     
                        
Marriage, is our wiſhes happines.
                     To which effect we haue ſent a generall challenge
                     To all the youthfull bloods of Affrica,

                     Dares foote the boſome of this deſart Ile,
                     (The ſtage where Ile performe this louers prize)
                     And by his wit and actiue pollicie,
                     Wooe, win, intice, or any way defeate
                     Me of my charge, my daughters of their harts,
                     Shall with their loues weare my imperiall crowne
                     Wreathe of their conqueſt.

                     Viol.
                     What coward would not venter a crackt crowne for ſuch a bootie?
                  
                  
                     Baſil.
                     To that intent our Iland is fenc't in
                     By ſea and Land, and at each corner built
                     A Caſtle for defence, which like great men

                     We haue appointed Captaines. More to deſire,
                     Is more then we are willing to diſcouer.

                     Well then ſiſter, I ſee we muſt to hap-hazard for husbands.

                     God ſend me one with a good face and I care not.
                  
                  
                     Hip.
                     Loue and be thy will, ſend mee one with a fayre table in his
forhead, like Time.

                     Nay, and his face be good, let mee alone to tricke his forehead,
a country-gentlewoman taught me how: But father I wonder
how you dare vndertake ſuch a peremptory challenge againſt all
cōmers, conſidering you haue beene ſo long troubled with an Ague.

                     An ague? what ague?
                  
                  
                     Hip.
                     VVhy your quotidian, Dametas the Court ſurfet, hee that
dwells in your eye, like a diſeaſe in your blood.
                  
                  
                     
                        Ʋiol.
                     And the Preſence were not exceeding empty-ſtomackt, it
would neuer diſgeſt ſuch Almes-basket-ſcraps, the very fall & garbidge
of gentry; fie vpon him, he becomes the great chamber worſe
then a Gentleman-vſher with wry legges.
                  
                  
                     Hip.
                     He is the moſt miſhapen ſute of gentility that euer the Court
wore.
                  
                  
                     
                        Ʋiol.
                     Had hee not beene of my fathers owne making, I ſhould
ha condemnd his taylor for an exceeding botcher.
                  
                  
                     
                     Baſil.
                     If you retaine the loue of children, or the dutie of ſubiects,
expreſſe it in your obedience, we know Dametas loues vs.
                  
                  
                     
                        Ʋilet.
                     As Captaines and Courtiers do old widdowes, for profit
and preferment.
                  
                  
                     Baſil.
                     In ſigne whereof we make him.
                  
                  
                     Hip.
                     Nay, you haue beſtowed too much of the making of him
vp already.
                  
                  
                     Viol.
                     The very making of him vp, has ſtood you in more then the
whole our ſides worth.
                  
                  
                     Baſil.
                     In my free thoughts you wrong him, therefore to expreſſe
our loue, and to giue the world publique note of his loyaltie, we create
him your Gardian.
                  
                  
                     Viol.
                     How father, my Gardian.

                     I mynion, yours.
                  
                  
                     Viol.
                     Doe you heare father, bid him beſpeake Spectacles, for my
fingers haue vowd to haue a blind match with his eyes.
                  
                  
                     Baſil.
                     Well ſaid Haggart, Ile make your proud hart ſtoope to the
lure of obedience. But come, by this time our challenge is publiſht,
and our gallants wits ſweating in the fielde of Inuention, and it behoues
vs not to reſt vnexerciſed.
                     So to our lodge, in the meane time be it knowne,
                     Our breath has power to raiſe, or caſt men downe.
                  
                  Exeunt.
                  Enter two Captaines.
                  
                     1 Cap.
                     Now Captaine Obſeruation, times bawde, thou that haſt
kept the Ages doore, whilſt vp-ſtart baſenes crept into the bedde of
greatneſſe, what dooſt thou thinke of this change?
                  
                  
                     2 Cap.
                     That it pleaſd the Duke, and becomes not ſubiects to examine
his actions.
                  
                  
                     1 Cap.
                     Thats no part of my meaning, yet would I gladly be better
inſtructed why the Duke broke vp his Court in Archadea, and
remoued it into this Iland?
                  
                  
                     2 Cap.
                     I am not Secretarie to his thoughts, but the generall mmour
is, that out of the freenes of his ſpirit, hee hath ſent a challenge
to all his neighbor Princes, that who ſoeuer (within a twelue month)
can defeate him of his daughters, ſhall with theyr loues, inioy his
dukedome, the garland propoſde for the victors.
                  
                  
                     1 Cap.
                     Your words throw ſence into mee, and thats the cauſe the
Iland is ſo ſurely guarded with watch-towers, ouer which our ſelu
                           ••
                        
                        
and other Captaines haue the charge.
                  
                  
                     2 Cap
                     And to the end, that not affection, but deſart may prooue
victor, are the two Ladies ſo narrowly obſerud, the one neuer out a
the eye of her Father, the other continually in the lodge of Dametas,
the Dukes chiefe director.
                  
                  
                     1 Cap.
                     If inquiſitiueneſſe be not too bolde a gueſt, what doe you
thinke of Dametas.
                     
                  
                  
                     2 Cap.
                     As of a little hillock, made great with others ruines.
                  
                  
                     1 Cap.
                     Your compariſon holds, for by report, his auarice has vnmade
many to make him vp.
                  
                  
                     2 Cap.
                     How did he firſt ſtumble on the Princes fauour?
                  
                  
                     1 Cap.
                     As ſome doe vpon offices, by fortune and flatterie, or as
truth ſaies, the Prince hauing one day loſt his way, wandring in the
woods found this Dametas, affected his diſcourſe, tooke him along
to the Court, and like great men in loue with their owne dooings,
countenanct his defects, gaue him offices, titles, and all the additions

                     2 Cap.
                     I cannot but commend the Duke for rayſing him, nor
yet praiſe him, that he proportions not his carriage aunſwerable to
his fortunes.
                  
                  
                     1 Cap.
                     Your thoughts and mine are twynnes in that: but I heare
the warning bell, ſome ſtrangers are ariued.
                  
                  
                     2 Cap.
                     Lets to our office then, and conduct them to Dametas,
whoſe cuſtome is to ſpet & hem, whilſt his ſcribe Maior takes they

                  Exeunt.
                  Enter Dametas and Manaſſes.
                  
                     Dame.
                     
                        Manaſſes, how dooſt like my play at Tennys?
                  
                  
                     Manaſ.
                     You play well Sir, but you looſe ſtill.
                  
                  
                     Dame.
                     Pollecie Manaſſes, pollicie, for when any man vpbraides
me with my gettings at Court, I may ſweare trulie I haue loſt more
then I haue got byte.
                  
                  
                     Manaſ
                     By the Tennis court I thinke you haue.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     If by any Court, tis enough to ſaue mine oath.
                     But what doe our ſpruce witted gallants ſay of my bounty.
                  
                  
                     Ma.
                     Faith ſir according to the proportion of it, little or nothing
they ſay tis a banckrout, and dares not ſhew his head.
                  
                  
                     Dame.
                     Then let em leaue reſting at me, though it pleaſe the Duke
for ſome fewe good parts that he ſees in me, to make me his familiar,

I ſcorne to be publique, or euery Courtiers companion: but who
comes heere?
                     Enter the two Captaines, with Aminter & Iulio two Princes, attyred
one like a poore ſouldior, the other like a poore ſcholler.
                     The Captaines of the watch-towers? what newes with you.
                  
                  
                     1 Cap.
                     A couple of peticioners, ant like your worſhip.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Had I beſt take theyr peticions Manaſſes?
                     
                  
                  
                     Ma.
                     O in any caſe, though you neuer peruſe em, tis the onelie
courſe in requeſt.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Fellowes, deliuer your peticions to my ſcribe Maior, and
doſt heare, put em vp Manaſſes, they may be wrongs to vs.
                  
                  
                     Manaſ.
                     And they be, I hope they be not the firſt wrongs I haue
put vp for your worſhip.
                  
                  put vp their papers.
                  
                     1 Cap.
                     That fellowes pocket is like a Taylers hell, it eates vp part
of euery mans due: tis an Executioner, and makes away more innocent
petitions in one yeere, then a red-headed hang man cuts ropes
in an age.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Now, what are you ſirra?

                     Then if they had a woman to their Iudge, they ſhould be
ſure to be cut off, for they cannot indure badde members in a Common-wealth.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     What are you?
                  
                  
                     Iuiso.
                     A poore ſcholler, ant like your worſhip.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Poore ſchollers doe not like our worſhip neither, they raile
againſt rich Cormorants, they are bad members to.

                     Dam.
                     Ile take order with em I warrant thee, and I may haue my
will, Ile ha neither poore ſcholler nor ſoldior about the Court.

                     Dam.
                     But I remember well enough I warrant you, I commaund
you, in my name and the Dukes, to attend your gard, and you regard
mee no more then a careleſſe Lawyer doth an vndone clyant,

but Ile informe: the Duke ſhall know, out, pack.

more officers, and one ſhall be to keepe ſchollers and ſouldiers out
of the Court, for they dare not come in the great Chamber alreadie,
for want of good clothes. But gods me Manaſſes, goe tell the Duke
I muſt ſpeake with him.

                     Iulio.
                     I doe not thinke the Duke will euer grant it.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Why not grant it? why ſhould you thinke he wil not grant
it. Such another word & Ile ſend you to Limbo inſtanthe.
                  
                  
                     Amin.
                     We thanke you good Dametas.
                     
                  
                  diſcouer themſelues.
                  
                     Iulio.
                     I hope youle take reaſonable baile for our forth-comming.
                  
                  
                     Am.
                     The caſe is alterd with you ſince you came out of Archadea.
                     
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     My honorable friends, Iulio and Aminter, my ſelfe and the
beſt abilitie of my power, lies at your ſeruice.
                  
                  
                     Amin.
                     You ſee how confidentlie wee preſume vpon your Letters
promiſe, in furthering vs to attaine the louers prize.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     The Dukes daughters are your owne, and in a word thus
ſhall you attaine em, ſome 3 daies hence I will appoint a hunting, to
which I will invite the Duke & both his daughters: in this hunt will
I vpon ſome ſuddaine occaſion deuide the traine▪ and hauing ſingled
out the two Does, I hope you haue wit enough to ſtrike.
                  
                  
                     Amin.
                     To ſtrike, how meane you.
                  
                  
                     
                     Dametas.
                     As headſmen doe, of with their maiden-heads, or if the
Duke offer reſiſtance, of with his crowne to.
                  
                  
                     Iulio.
                     That were violence, & cleane oppoſite to the intent of the
challenge.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Come ye are ſhallow, too't vi et armis, too't, Ile be your ſecond,
thinke of the crowne, ha my Letters trauaild for you, my wit
wrought for you, and my inuention ſweat for you, to poſſeſſe you of
your loues, and ſeate you in the Dukedome, & come you now with
tis violence, and againſt the intent of the challenge, I am aſhamd to
heare you.
                  
                  
                     Iulio.
                     Nay Dametas, and your reſolution be ſo forward, ours ſhal
ouer-take you, wee doubted leaſt the preferments your Lord hath
heapt vpon you, had ſmotherd your affection to vs ward.
                  
                  
                     Amin.
                     That was the father that begot the doubt in vs, you will
appoint the hunt.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Seuer the Duke, deuide the traine, and then.
                  
                  
                     Iul.
                     Wee ha your meaning.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Put it in execution then, but firſt entertaine ſome new diſguiſe,
as at our next meeting Ile informe you. Adiew, I ſhall thinke
long till I ſee you agen.
                  
                  Exit.
                  
                     Amin.
                     As a Lawyer doth for his clyant for a ſecond ſee. Heeres
no Iudas?
                     
                  
                  
                     Iulio.
                     Yes, and a damnd one to, for hee would betray and ſell his
Maiſter.
                  
                  
                     Amin.
                     Tis common in ſuch baſe fellowes, ſuch Court-ſpyders,
that weaue their webbes of flatterie in the eares of greatneſſe, if they
can once entangle them in their quaint trecherie, they poyſen em
ſtraight.
                  
                  
                     Iulio.
                     They are like vnneceſſarie wormes, whō the ſon of greatnes
creates of the groſſe and ſlimie multitude, as ſoone as they recouer
ſtrength, they eate into the credite of true borne gentrie, vndermine
and worke out the true nobilitie, to inroote & eſtabliſh themſelues.
                  
                  
                     Am.
                     And in the end, like Eſops ſtaru'd ſnake, hauing lapt the ſweet
milk of greatnes, made themſelues ſtrong in authoritie and friendes,
they turne their ſtings of enuie into their preſeruers boſome.
                  
                  
                     Iul.
                     The example liues in this Dametas, who notwithſtanding the
Duke hath raiſd him to that height that hee lookes equall with himſelfe,
yet for the baſe hope of incertaine gouernment, hee offers him

to ſale, but let his treaſon liue to the laſt minute.
                  
                  
                     Amin.
                     For my part Ile make that vſe of him that Phiſitions do of
poyſon, vſe as much of him as ſerues for mine honeſt intent, & caſt
downe the reſt, as vnfit for any neceſſary imployment.
                  
                  
                     Iulio.
                     Let our carriage in this attempt put on no ſhow of violence
either to the Duke, or his daughters.
                  
                  
                     Amin.
                     And let our diſcourſe goe ſo ſmoothly apparrelled, that
it moue not the patience of the moſt tender eare.
                  
                  
                     Iulio.
                     About it then, though his intent be baſe,
                     Our enterpriſe ſhall weare a noble face.
                  
                  Exeunt.
                  Enter Liſander like an Amazon.
                  
                     Liſan.
                     Archadea, thou heauen, within whoſe ſpheare
                     The ſtarre that guides my motion is fixt,
                     I court thy gracious boſome with a kiſſe
                     For this admittance: in thine amorous armes
                     Faire 
                           Ʋioletta, fayrer then the flower
                     That chriſtned her, and grac't her with that name
                     Doe play the wanton:
                     Onely her Father like a couetous Churle,
                     Owner of that vnvalewed Diamond,
                     Hath made this deſart Ile th'vnwilling cheſt
                     In which he locks her. But the fayre aduantage
                     Of this large challenge, and my ſtarres to friend,
                     Ayded by this diſguiſe, I ſhall breake ope
                     His yron Casket, and inlarge my hope.
                  
                  Enter Dametas, and Manaſſes.
                  
                     Manaſ.
                     This way ſhe went ſir, this way.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     But I ſay this way, I would thou ſhouldſt know, we olde
Courtiers can hunt a Cony, and put her to the ſqueake, & make her
cry out like a young married wife of the firſt night.
                  
                  
                     Manaſ.
                     For more helpe, as ſome of them haue done,
                     But there ſhe is.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Ile vpon her preſently, dooſt heare me firra, thou veſſall of
infirmitie, woman, and by thy out-ſide little better then one of the
wicked, come hether and ſhow thy ſelfe before vs, ſhow thy ſelfe before
Dametas.
                     
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     
                        Dametas, Liſander then diſſemble,
                     For hee's the man muſt worke thy entrance.
                  
                  
                     
                     Dam.
                     What art thou, ſpeake.
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     My mother is the Queene of Amaſons,
                     My ſelfe a virgin, married vnto Armes
                     And bold archieuements, who haue pac'd the world
                     In queſt of fayre Autioste my ſiſter:
                     And turning homeward, the inconſtant windes
                     And wrathfull Neptune caſt me on this ſhore.
                  
                  
                     Dame.
                     And whats your buſines now you are landed?
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     My buſines is priuate with the Duke.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     The Duke is buſie, and ſhall ſpeake with no body.
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     I beſeech you ſir.
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     Tis no beſeeching matter I aſſure you.
                  
                  
                     Manaſ.
                     No, neuer beſeech for the matter, for except you could
beſeech with the tongue of Angels, tis to no purpoſe with him.
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     Tis ſtrange, I haue heard thy maiſter is a very good man
where he takes.
                  
                  
                     Manaſ.
                     True, where he takes he is, but hee takes nothing of you,
and therefore looke for no kindneſſe from him.
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     Good, and dooſt thou take after thy maiſter?
                  
                  
                     Ma.
                     No madam, I take commonly afore my maiſter, for where
he takes, he takes all, and leaues nothing for me to take.
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     Oh, I feele your meaning.
                  
                  
                     Ma.
                     Let my maiſter haue ſome feeling of yours, and heele preſet
your ſute.
                  
                  
                     Liſa.
                     Tis not the Dukes pleaſure Peticioners ſhould buy theyr
acceſſe.
                  
                  
                     Ma.
                     Als one, tis my maiſters pleaſure, and vſuall faſhion.
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     And I muſt maintaine the faſhion. Worſhipfull Dametas,
my late ſhipwrack as you ſee, hath made a defeate both of my friends
and treaſure, notwithſtanding, Fortune hath reſeru'd me one Iewell,
which if I might requeſt your worſhippe in loue to accept, and be a
meanes to worke my admittance to the Duke, I ſhould become a
true detter to your loue.
                  
                  
                     Dame.
                     VVell Madam, tho I hate nothing more then a man that
takes brybes, yet preſt by your importunitie, and that you tender it
in loue, leaſt I might ſeeme too nice to withſtand a Ladies fauour, Ile
weare it for your ſake, and if the Duke be not too buſily imployd,
worke your acceſſe.
                  
                  
                     
                     Liſan.
                     So dooing, you ſhall performe the office of a dere-bought
friend.
                  
                  Exit Dametas.
                  
                     Manaſ.
                     How quickly the tyde's turnde, but doe you heare Madam,
tho I take neither afore nor after my Maiſter, yet take my
counſell, & doe not truſt my maiſter: If you haue a ſute to the Duke
keepe it to your ſelfe, for if you truſt my maiſter with it, heele prefer
it for you, but heele begd for himſelfe.
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     Thats plaine cooſnage.
                  
                  
                     Ma
                     Fie no, tis cunning in him, marry twould bee though little
better then cooſnage in a country gentleman: but he returnes.
                  
                  Enter Dametas agen.
                  
                     Dam.
                     Madam, I haue beene earneſt, very earneſt with the Duke
for your admittance.
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     And haue you wrought it?
                  
                  
                     Dam.
                     I haue, marry you muſt thinke I beſtowd much labor int.
                  
                  
                     Liſan.
                     Tmay be you did.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Tmay be you did: & looke a ſeance like a Pothecaries wife

ſuppoſe he ſhould ſhow you the known marke of his neck, to aſſure

                     Why what ſhould I do madam,

                     Boy.

                     Man.
                     Good counſell is worth good monie, Madame.
                  
                  
                     Liſa.
                     Thou ſhalt be well conſidered; there's twentie Crownes

                     Man.
                     Nay Madame, this hand's like a fellow, it takes euerie
thing in ieſt; if you be in earneſt, let me feele it heere: So Ladie,
now betwixt earneſt and ieſt, if your Will be readie drawne, before
your friend deliuer'd as your deed, and put me in truſt to execute
it.

                     Man.
                     Man, an woman perhaps; but not man and wife: for
though moſt women haue a wil to be Ladies, like my Lords wife;
yet euerie Ladie haue not witte to be a wife, as my Lordes
Daughter. But what good can I doe in this?
                  
                  
                     Liſa.
                     O verie much: for though they be man and wife by oath

is yet vnperformed, and hearing that you haue tane orders.

                     And you in the wrong, Ile keepe your ieaſt, but in

                     Oh ſir! though my M. hath but bad eyes, he hath exceeding
long eares: and though a Forrayner may play with a Citizens
wooden Dagger, I would not wiſh any to ieſt with a Courtiers
ſteeld Sword; tis ſeldome drawne but it drawes blood.

                     Tuſh man, be not ſo timerous, my credit ſhall countenance
thee: bee not an Aſſe, make vſe of thy time: thy Maiſters ſeruice

thou art a foole, and thou wilt looſe vnder him: there's a hundred
Crownes for thee; tuſh man, thy betters will ſtraine curtſey

                     Madam, could you to euery one of theſe Crownes giue

                     Man.
                     I ſhould ha more ground then halfe the Kinges in Chriſtendom:
here's my hand, Ile do't: my M. is my M. & I loue him;
but my gold's my God, and I honor it: Ile do't; the time & place?

Why, I haue counterfaited his hand & ſeale. He has been content

Embaſſadour, when he was heat with drinking of healthes. As I
led him to his Chamber, I nimde his Chayne, and drew his Purſe,
and next morning perſwaded him he loſt it in the great Chamber
at the Reuels. He puts mee in truſt with his whole eſtate: he
buyes Maners, I purchaſe Farmes: he buildes houſes, I plucke
downe Churches: he gets of the Duke, and I of the Commons:
he beggers the Court, and I begger the whole Countrey.

                     Theſe are notable knauiſh courſes. What breeding haſt had?
                  
                  
                     Man.
                     Verie good breeding Sir: My great Graundfather was a
Rat-catcher, my Grandſier a Hangman, my Father a Promooter,
and my ſelfe an Informer.

                     And by education too: but Bawdie Informations growing

a Sheepe out a the way: but my deare flocke and louing Sheepe,

                     So, ſo; how violently he deuowers his bane, and ſteales
himſelfe into the order of Gullerie: mee thinkes I ſee how betwixt
hope and feare he ſweates in his practiſe, and like a fooliſh
dreamer, caſtes how to lay out his wealth before it comes in.
So much for him: Now to my Ladie Beautie his wife; and as the
Diuell would ha're, heere ſhe comes.
                  
                  
                  Enter Miſo.
                  
                     Miſo.
                     
                        Dorus, how now Dorus' What time a day is't with you?
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     What time a day ſo'ert be with mee, tis ſleeping time
with my Lord, I'am ſure of that.
                  
                  
                     Miſ.
                     Sleeping time Dorus, what doſt thou meane by that?
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Nay nothing: he is troubld with a kind of maladie cald
Iuſurectio carnis.
                     
                  
                  
                     Miſo.
                     How, a diſh of Creuices? nay and that be the worſt, good
enough: I am glad a falles to Fiſh, for he was giuen to Fleſh a late
too too bad.
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Maſſe I thought as much, for I ſaw him go a angling.
                  
                  
                     Miſo.
                     I hold my Ladiſhip to ſome ſtrumpet.
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Life, a ieloſie; I thinke you are a Witch, t'was ſo indeed.
                  
                  
                     Miſo.
                     Nay I thought as much: he was wont to kiſſe mee, and
doe all kindnes a man could doe, till he came to the Court; and
nowe hee will not lie with mee forſooth: and why? tis the
Court faſhion. He will not loue mee, and why? tis the Court faſhion.
I muſt not come neere him at his downe lying, nor his
vpriſing, ctc. And this be the Court faſhion, would I were an honeſt
woman of the Countrie againe, be Courtiers who liſt. I, I,
Dorus, I tell thee in teares, hee hath not done by mee, as a Huſband
ſhould doe.
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Tis nothing to mee, I cannot do withall Madam, would
I could.
                  
                  
                     Mis.
                     Yes marie mayſt thou Dorus; thou mayſt, and ſhalt doe
withal too and thou wilt: but as thou lookeſt to enioy my daughter
Mopſa, acquaint mee with the olde Foxes ſtarting hole.
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     That's paſt my cunning: the olde Foxe has more holes
then one, to hide's head in: But not to goe long about the buſh
with you.
                  
                  
                     Miſ.
                     No good Dorus, I do not loue a man ſhould go long about
my buſh: What is ſhe for a woman?
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     I know not what shee is for a woman; marie I feare she's
litle better then a Whore for your Husband: harke in your eare;
shee's Manaſses wife.
                  
                  
                     Miſo.
                     
                        Manaſſes wife? marie fire Maiſter gunner; a Putitane
turnd Puncke: Gods my precious. Ile ſlit her noſe, as I am a
Ladie will I: is shee the partie you wot on?
                  
                  
                     
                     Dor.
                     Yes fayth Madam, shee is the Mare the man rid on.
                  
                  
                     Miſ.
                     Ile ſpoile their ſport, ſadle my Mule there, haue an eie to
the princeſſe: ſhalt ha my daughter and be but to ſpite him withal,
faith Fox ile ha you out of your hole, or ile fire you out.
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Nay that will doe no good, but for your owne good Madam,
take heed you doe not ſcold.
                  
                  
                     Miſe.
                     Why may not a Lady ſcold Dorus?
                     
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Scold, O in no caſe, twill marre a Ladies beautie cleane,
and make her looke as hard fauoured at any ordinarie woman.
                  
                  
                     Miſ.
                     Godamercie for that Dorus, Ile not looſe my beautie for
twentie on'em: ſaddle my Mule, bring me my chopping knife,
Ile gold the lecherous Goat, and mince his Trull, as ſmall as herbs
to the pot. This is not ſcolding Dorus, is't?
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     No this is tollerable.
                  
                  
                     Miſ.
                     Nay then I care not, ſaddle my Mule I ſay, let her pray
God her feeling be good, for as I am a Ladie, Ile not leaue her an
ele to ſee withall, and yet I will not ſcold neither.
                  
                  Exit.
                  
                     Dor.
                     Oh take heed of that at any hand, So, ſo, ſo: now it begins
to quicken me thinkes, I ſee alreadie how ſhe runs atilt at the
Wenches eies: cals the maid Baud, the woman Whore, and her
husband Lecher: and when all comes to all, like an Iriſh Wolfe,
ſhe barkes at her owne ſhadow; but committing her and her Aſſe
to their wildgooſe chaſe: now to my ſweet hart Mopſa, for she's
all the blockes laſt in my eie to ſlumble on: and God bleſſe my
wits, for the foole haunts me.
                  
                  Enter Mopſa.
                  
                     Mopſ.
                     
                        Dorus, where's my Father Dorus?
                     
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Your Father, Oh my deare Mopſa?
                     
                  
                  
                     Mop.
                     Nay now you flout me?
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Flout you? oh the faire heauens, but this ti's for a man
to caſt away himſelfe in violence of paſsion and extremitie of ſighs
on a piece of beautie, that cares not for him, but it is the tricks
on you all.
                  
                  
                     Mop.
                     Trickes, no as god mend me, and I should not haue a huſband
till I got him with tricks, I should lead apes in hell: but
faith tell me, doſt thou loue me Dorus?
                     
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Doe I loue you quoth ye, It cuts my very heart ſtrings,
doe I loue you? why tis the onely marke my Inqeuors she or at.
                  
                  
                     
                     Mop.
                     If thou doſt not hit the marke, then thou'rt a very bungler:
but where is my Father?
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Why I haue ſent him and your mother out of the way of
purpoſe, and appointed Manaſſes to meet vs this euening at Adonis
Chappell in the Amaſons apparell, to marrie vs: I thinke this
are ſignes I loue you.
                  
                  
                     Mop.
                     I but you ieaſt, I doubt you will not marrie me.
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Will you meere me there?
                  
                  
                     Mop.
                     As I am a Virgin I will.
                  
                  
                     Dor,
                     And come with an intent to marrie me?
                  
                  
                     Mop.
                     As I hope to be a wife I will.
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     You muſt take heed you keepe our purpoſe cloſe,

                     As I did the loſſe of my Maydenhead.
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Why haue you loſt it then?
                  
                  
                     Mop.
                     Many a deere day agoe, yet I told Nobody on't but my
Mother and our Horſekeeper, and they ſay I am nere the worſe
mayd for that, and I can keepe my owne counſell, as I hope I ſhal;
but will you meet me ſoone?
                  
                  
                     Dor.
                     Iuſt in the mid-way, as Tilters doe.

                     Ile goe afore and ſtay, but doe not deceiue me, and you

                     Dor.
                     So tria ſequntur tria, now am I rid of a triumuirie of fooles,
                     and by there abſence haue won a free acceſle to an eſcape.

                     Duke.
                     No more of theſe delayes ſweet Madam, your loue

                     Liſa.
                     I confeſſe it my Liege, and like a ſpent Deare, not able to

                     Duk.
                     Although thy Breath be neuer but Muſicall, yet it neuer

                     If you deceiue me.

                     Well howſoeuer, we muſt not dwell long determining

                     Tis very true, and for my part, Ile rather go home with

                     Thats my very thought, yet that our ſecond ariuall bee
not altogether empty of imploiment, lets practiſe ſomething vpon
Dametas, and acquaint the world with his coward baſenes; in
which, he not only detracts from his maſters bountie, but looke
how as Conduit head or maſter-ſpring that is poiſoned, doth his
beſt, to enfect the whole bodie of the court, with the leproſie of
his couetouſneſſe.

                     How can they when there Father's a mungrell, the Duke
out of his honourable bountie commaunded him to reward our
trauailes with 200. Crownes: and now after two moneths attendance,
and enforſt delayes: In which time an ordenarie petitioner
might haue ſpent the vaſew of the reward, he packes vs off with
50. Crownes, his excuſe being that his maſter hath forgot vs, and
what he doth, is of his owne bountie, as if the Moone ſhould brag
ſhe gaue the world light, when al the luſter she hath, comes from
the heat of the Sunne.

                     Should his villanies be ſuffered to proſper, they would
grow to ſuch height, as the Dukes authoritie should ha much
trouble to prune them.
