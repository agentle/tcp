Olyuer or the paynym toke ony

And whan thys valyaunt olyuer

Olyuer that noble knyȝt whiche

Thys counceyl was wel

The ſtandardes were reyſed / and

And thentree of the cyte of mā

For / for to come thyder by aſſaulte /

Ryol demaunded of Rychard

And he anſuerd / knowe ye that

And commaunded hym

                     ſayd /
lordes I wyl goo byfore & ſhal
ſpeke fyrſt / and whan we haue
paſſed the fyrſt yate / ſee that ye
take of your clokes for to ſmyte

Ryol anſuerd doubte ye not /

but that I ſhal doo my

yf I doo not as I ſay I wyl that
ye reclame me recreaunte and
repute me as rebouted / After

theſe wordes they haſted theyr
ſommyers toward the brydge / &
galafre ſawe them fro ferre / and
ſtode reſtyng hym nygh to the
fyrſt gate / & helde in his honde
a grete axe of fyn ſtele bended
                     and 
                     affyled that there was noo

was grete and fonrmed ſo
hydouſly and of ſuche repreſentacyon
that he ſemed better a deuyl
than a reſonable perſone / he
had eyen al enflammed lyke

led pytche / hys necke large &
grete / his noſe half a fote longe
his ceres ſo grete that they myȝt
conteyne wel half a buſſhel of
whete / hys armes longe & croked
& his feet ſtode ouerthwart
& as of the remenaunte of hys
body was lothely ynough / Ballāt
thadmyral loued hym moche
& was his neuewe / and for the
grete confydence that he had in
hym / he gaf to hym the kepyng
of the brydge of mantryble / by
cauſe that it was the mooſt ſtrengeſt
paſſage that was in al the
marches of that contreye / And
the ſayd paynym was coneſtable
of al the londes of thadmyral / 
wherfore it was neceſſarye
that none of the frenſſhe men
ſhold haue be knowen of hym / 
For yf there had ony be knowen
there ſhold neuer none haue eſcaped
but he ſhold haue ben dede
Thus thenne whan they were
at mantryble / Rychard paſſed

And therfor ye four ſhal be ſette

                     ſayd Ryol I may no longer
tarye to ſee hym do thys Iniurye
to my coſyn / yf I ſuffer
lenger / be I confounded / And
therwyth he threwe of his cloke
and ſmote vpon the paynym / 
but he was ſo ſtrongely armed
that he myght do hym no harme
ſauf that he ſmote of a lytel of

ſemblably caſte of theyr clokes
and eche of them with a ſwerde
in theyr hondes ſmote to gydre
vpon Galafre and gof hym many

body they myght not hurte / 
For he was armed with the hyde
of on olde Serpente harde and
                     maylled / ¶Thys Paynym
was angry and ſuppoſed for to
haue ſmyton Ryol / and enhaunced

Ryol ſawe the ſtroke come / and

I am al abaſſed of the puyſſaunce

He thus ſayeng he took a grete

                     and 
                     marked the paynym wel / 
and he ſmote hym therwyth in
ſuche wyſe that he made hym to

he was ouerthrowen he maad a

Ryuer and the roches made grete

                     and 
                     aſſembled / that with

Rychard of Normandye
ranne to the yate of the brydge
& aualed doun the drawe bridge
And thenne entred in v hondred
knyghtes whych the foure
barons had brought wyth them
but at the entre of the gate the
paynyms encountred them / there
was a grete medle and recountre
many mortal ſtrokes were there
gyuen / many were there ſlayne
and hurte / Rychard took hys
horne and 
                     ſowned it hyely thre

it wel whyche was in
the wood aforeſayd with al his

on horſback moche redyly / and
there was not one that ceſſed to
renne tyl he came to the brydge / 
                  ¶Ganellon whyche after was
traytour bare hym valyauntly / 
For he was the fyrſt that cam to

reyſed / but the loyalte & trouthe
of hym ne of hys kynneſmen endured
not longe / as the laſte
book ſhal more playnly ſhewe

                  ¶Now by force and ſtrengthe
of bataylle Charles entred in to

For whome he attayned wyth

and that day was alway by

wherin many were drowned
¶Thus as Charles paſſed tofore
and hys people after / He
ſawe galafre on ye groūde which
was not dede / and that ſemed
better a deuyl than a reſonable

axe in hys honde / wyth whyche
he had ſlayn thyrty frenſſh men
And the Emperour ſeeyng the
harme that he had doon to the
frenſſhe men / anone commaunded
to ſlee hym & ſo moche they
ſmote at hym wyth axes and

For he knewe wel that
