                  IN the fyrst weke of the season of Maye
               Whan the wodes be couered in grene
               In whiche the nyghtyngale lyst for to play

               Thē to reioyce whiche loue seruaūtes bene
               Whiche fro all cōforte thȳke thē fast behȳde
               My pleasyr was as it was after sene
               For my dysporte to chase harte and hynde.
            
            
               Than I commaunded my houndes to goo
               To drawe aboute yf they myght fynde a vewe
               And forthe we wente bothe I and other moo
               Nowe here now there the huntes for to sewe
               Whiche in theyr hornes many blastes dyde blowe
               To fynde an harte they dyde theyr full entente
               In a forest of myn for to say trewe
               In whiche to hunte I had grete talente.
            
            
               We sought so moche about in euery parte
               Tyll at the last we founde ryght well to chace
               Grete hartes out of the hyrde a parte
               Whiche went about theyr pastoure to purchace
               And than anone we wente for to embrace
               Many braunches of Elme and of hable tre
               With whiche to dresse vs a good standynge place
               We made vs busshes well as semed me.
            
            
               Whan this was done I tourned my bak anone
               To fette my houndes and came sone agayne
               Where of aloundes I brought many one
               And whan I cam in to the forest playne
               I founde anone the hounte of hartes twayne
Herte & eye.
               
                  
For whiche I made to blowe hornes hye
               And houndes syxe score and mo certayne
               Whiche made me thought a Ioyous melodye.
            
            
               For that poure herte that sorowe doth manace
               Myght haue pleasaunce and also grete comforte
               To here the houndes make that mery chace
               So properly they ranne of one accorde
               And eke so swyfte was theyr mery reporte
               That it me thought as very paradyse
               For in that forest was moch more dysporte
               Than Instrument coud make to my deuyse.
            
            
               And in chasynge not fer out of my way
               I herde a womans voyse wonder clere
               More swetter herde I neuer none to my pay
               Than of my hors I descended ryght there
               To vnderstande the better and to here
               So longe tyll yt theyr songes were songe & done
               And for to knowe the place I drewe me nere
               Where as I herde this noble enprese sone.
            
            
               And I serched ladyes many one
               I founde syttynge about a fayre fountayne
               Under a pyne whiche shadowed them echone
               It was thynge to me yet vncertayne
               To knowe of theym whiche was the souerayne
               Theyr behauynge so Inly notable
               And to theyr beaute yf I sholde not fayne
               Of all other they were Incomperable.
            
            
               And in thyr presence yf I sholde not lye
               
                  
Were gentyll women of ryght goodly statute
               I had not seen afore in company
               More fressher folke of shap I you ensure
               And in theyr doynge sad and eke demure
               To fest the people they had grete delyght
               All that I sawe was done by good measure
               And well demend euery maner wyght.
            
            
               And I approched as nygh as I myght
               And saluted them anone full curteysly
               And towarde me there came two anone ryght
               Whiche sayd to me vs semeth verely

               As it appereth well in your persone
               Whan ye be wery ye may rest hardely
               And lete your houndes make them game alone.
            
            
               Than we pray you that ye wyll come and se
               These ladyes and damoysselles in fere
               And they shall fest you as they can perde
               To youre worshyp and theyres in all manere
               And in syngynge they haue none here theyr pere

               And goodly storyes who so lyst to here
               They can reporte and there of haue grete fame.
            
            
               So moch of wele they gan to me recorde
               That I was rauysshed meruelously
               For whiche my thoughtes felle sone to accorde
               To se theym and whan I sawe trewly
               Theyr fayre bodyes made so parfytly
               Where god hym selfe and also dame nature

Had planted beaute ryght plentyuously
               Ferre aboue ony erthely creature.
            
            
               And to all them I dyde such reuerence
               Which as to me thought I ought to do soone
               Not oonly after the hygh apperence
               Of theyr noblenesse but after one by oone
               And there wanted nothynge that sholde be done
               Of worshyppe there men myghte ensample fynde
               So goodly folke yet sawe I neuer none
               For in all plesaunce set was hole theyr mynde.
            
            
               And I was of these ladyes gracyous
               Receyued well with perfyte gentylnesse
               The whiche of floures ryght delycyous
               Made a fresshe chapelet the soth for the expresse
               I had not seen suche one by fore doubtelesse
               The whiche they gaue to me ryght courteysly
               And than I founde that eye of all gladnesse
               Was retresshed ryght well and Ioyously.
            
            
               Than one of them me by the hande dyde take
               And gan to synge a songe of grete pleasaunce
               And to all that other answeres sone gan make
               Hole togyder without varyaunce
               So parfyely with all the cyrcumstaunce
               That I haue not harde none of suche mesure
               It was a lyfe to voys all dyspleasaunce
               Out of a troubled herte I you ensure.
            
            
               All these lerners that were present
               Began to synge that Ioy it was to here
               
                  
In suche places where they dyde talent
               They cast theyr syght eche man in his gre there
               And some gan syghe with pytuous loke and chere
               Offrynge theyr hertes with hole intente
               Whyle that / that theyr lyfe and body were in fere
               So moche that loue sholde there with be contente
            
            
               That one of them wente out fro the feest
               And with drewe her out of the company
               And can not say why it was at the leest
               But well I wote and dare say verely
               Myn eye had grete pleasure her to aspy
               Warnynge my hert on her to take good hede
               Which of all sorowe was all voyd trewely
               Whan I behelde her goodly woman hede.
            
            
               It semed an aungell that god had made
               To come adowne for beaute souerayne
               There coude no man se with his eyen glade
               A more gracyous lady the sothe to sayne
               Her for to please though I dyde all my payne
               I coude not telle her fetures halfendele
               Therfore I commytte this matere all playne
               With them that lust with materes to dele.
            
            
               And for her beaute which was imperyall
               My pleasure alway gan me to complayne
               To sewe for grace and dyde me hole trauayll
               To whome my thought gan to strayne certayne
               Yet my poure herte sayd he wolde do his payne
               And toke none hede to her noble grace
               In his seruyse for to be trewe and playne
               
                  
Her for to serue durynge my lyues space.
            
            
               And whan she had thought all that her lyst
               To the feest she tourned anone ryght
               And with her voys whiche was most swetyst
               Began to synge with all her force and myght
               And as she cast aboute her gooly syght
               Whiche was grete plesaunce to all there
               Unto myn eye it gaue so greate a lyght
               That in all comforte I stode verely clere.
            
            
               And or that she had ended her songe
               An harte came rynnynge by them haftly
               And lepte in to a welle all them amonge
               Than for myn houndes I blewe certaynly
               With whome the harte was holde so strayt truely
               That he thought he sholde not longe endure
               And for grete rere he lept full besely
               For of his deth he demed hym very sure.
            
            
               The ladyes and the grete gentyll women also
               Had grete pleasure to be holde and se
               And dyde theyr part to helpe the houndes so
               The harte to take at soyle yf it myght be
               But suche dysporte before I dyde not se
               Myn eye wolde not therof no treasure make
               But her in whome all vertue was plente
               Behelde all waye I dare well vndertake.
            
            
               And whan this harte aspyed well his tyme
               He leped lyghtly out of the fountayne clere
               My wery houndes layd them styll by me
               
                  
For none of them myght nothynge nygh hyre nē
               
               He brake the busshes so here and there
               He went his way withouten ony arest
               And rennynge for the amonge the bowes shere
               He scope vs fro and toke the thyk forest
            
            
               I went to these ladyes my leue to take
               The harte to pursewe I dyde myne entente
               Within a whyle my corage gan to shake
               Myn herte suche dyscomforte to hym hath hente
               That I ne knewe well what hontynge mente
               But well I wote I was full of dysease
               Me to dysporte I had but small talente
               But late my thought forthe all at his ease.
            
            
               And what for walkynge I was wery sone
               Seynge the sonne began to go to rest
               Of harte ne houndes I coud se ryght none
               As ferre as I coud loke both est and west
               An one the nyght began to make hym prest
               So fast he came that I lost my place
               And styll to abyde me thought it for the best
               Tyll that the day began to shewe his face.
            
            
               I tyed myn hors vnto a fayre grene tre
               Agayne the whiche myn hede anone I sette
               The erthe as colde as marble semed me
               Whiche made my tethe all in myn heed to whette
               My selfe compleynynge how that I was sette
               That I myght not that lady se agayne
               Whome that myn eye promysed an behette

Herte & eye.
               
                  
And with that thought I founde that eye
               Had lost myn hope and Ioyes euerychone
               And that harde sorowe ny

               Through the whiche I was rauysshed soo
               That in all Ioy me thought I was stedefast
               And her goodnesse in me portted thou hast
               And or I aske mercy or grace
               She was ryght ferre out of thy syght ypast
               For whiche dyspayre me straytly doth embrace.
            
            
               eye
               I haue fraunchyse that all myn owne pleasaunce
               My syght to cast whan that me lyketh best
               For whiche thou ought to haue no dyspleasaunce
               Thy drede and myn be not lyke at the lest
               Though that we bothe in one place take our rest
               I am ordeyned to beholde and se
               And than to leue sholdest alway be prest
               Why puttest thou this blame than all on me.
            
            
               herte
               Lyke as fruyte may not wexe type kyndely
Herte & eye.
               
                  
But yf he take of the sonne some maner hete
               In lyke wyse I may not lyue trewely
               Without thy counseyle wherfore cause grete
               I haue to blame the syth I may not gete
               Syth of her alas the harde whyle
               I am not lyke with her to mete
               How mayst thou forth me thus begyle.
            
            
               eye
               Though I beholde a ladyes grete beaute
               Through whiche thou art be comen amerous
               And as of hope thou arte in no suerte
               Which maketh the haply ryght dolorous
               Yet sholdest thou not with wordes rygorous
               So wofully me to repreue and blame
               Now in good fayth thou arte not vertuous
               To do or say that sholde be to my shame.
            
            
               herte
               Thou oughtest well somwhat lenger to abyde
               Tyll that the mouth had her be sought of grace
               And that the ere had take good hede that tyde
               In his concept yf I had ony place
               So myght thou to me his pleasaunce purchace
               But I nowe fele that I am so purueyde
               Of sorowe whiche doth me sore embrace
               And of all Ioye I knowe me dysperueyde.
            
            
               I recke no of the mouth nor of the nose
               Of eere nor fote nor of the handes twayne
               It sytteth me moch better as I suppose
               To loke vpon a fayre lady certane
               And to be holde them I shall do my payne
               Which is my pleasaunce and euer shall be
               
                  
For I recke not whether thou laugh or complayne
               Take now ryght good hede what I say to the.
            
            
               herte
               Thou scornest fast mortherer as I trowe
               Thou hast me smyte with a stroke mortall
               By thy fals loke thou hast me ouerthrowe
               I wende full lytell thou had be such at all
               Thou hast me cast with out the castell wall
               Of good comforte and out of all gladnesse
               Therfore in fayth I may the ryght well call
               Worse than an erytyke the trouth to expresse.
            
            
               eye
               I am no mortherer nor out of byleue
               Thou shalte me fynde alway both playne & trewe
               Nor by no wytnesse shalte thou neuer preue
               That euer I was to man vntrewe
               And namly to name whoos stappes I shewe
               And yf thou wolde say ought to the contrary
               To desyre the marshall I wyll pursewe
               And make hym Iuge I wyll not lenger tary.
            
            
               herte
               As moch as is in me I am contente for certayne
               Byfore hym the causes nede
               Of our stryfe betwene vs twayne
               And lete the trouthe for vs procede
               That he may knowe where the faute is in dede
               And lete hym Iuge for vs both ryghtfully
               Without mercy for ryght so god me spede
               In that quarell I dare well fyght trewely.
            
            
               eye
               Than the eye answered in this manere
               That he wolde hym defende with all his myght
Herte & eye.
               
                  
Than both two were accorded thus in fere
               To go towardes the courte of loue full ryght
               Whan they came to shewe theyr ryght
               Than sayd desyre of loue the marshall
               Tell thou thy cause anone here in our fyght
               Of our rumor that is bytwene you fall.
            
            
               herte
               The herte than toke no maner of counseyll
               But his owne tale he tolde full trewely
               And desyre lo here my cause saunsfefayll
               The eye hath done to me vncurteysly
               Not longe a go he put his syght trewly
               On the fayrest and best where euer she go
               For his pleasure and not for myn trewly
               Ryght in this wyse as I shall telle you lo.
            
            
               Whan the eye had on her set his syght
               Loue put in me of his grete worthynesse
               Thought desyre / & pleasaunce these thre ful ryght
               Whiche sholde make me to stand in stedefulnesse
               For to loue her without doublenesse
               Yf than I myght her grace to attayne
               Whome I am lyke neuer to se doubtlesse
               Wherfore I haue grete heuynesse and payne.
            
            
               And thus the eye hath sette me in such plyght
               For whan he sawe that I was thus take
               With loue of her he parted from him quyght
               Or that I coud my certaynte make
               Wherfore of tyme I trymble sore and quake
               And thynke ryght longe after allygeaunce
               Thus by the eye my wo begynneth to wake
               
                  
All in dyspayre thus standynge in balaunce.
            
            
               And with this gryefe I am to deth brought
               And out of Ioye standefull forowfully
               All in dyscomforte as I ne rought
               Of erthely thynge so troubleth me the eye
               For yf the fayre had not so pleasauntely
               Her goodly loke on me be set so sore
               This sorowe had not comen to me trewly
               But I had lyued as I dyd before.
            
            
               Wherfore I complayne me thus ryghtfully
               Of grete iniurye that the eye hath done
               And my cause is mente moost faythfully
               Wherfore to you I do submyssyon
               And on my trouth I make promyssyon
               To fyght with hym in loues hygh presence
               Byfore the whiche we shall knowe soone
               The ryght fro wronge without more dyffence.
            
            
               eye
               The eye answered and sayd in this manere
               I haue done nothynge contrarye to thyne herte
               For though I cast myn loke bothe here and there
               Upon the fayre yf ye lyst well aduerte
               The herte sholde not in his conceyt peruerte
               Syth loue hath graunted me the hygh offyce
               I wyll it kepe an neuer fro it sterte
               Of hym I haue none other benefyce.
            
            
               herte
               The herte replyed with his full entente
               And sayd thou eye thou arte fals and vntrewe
               I cast to fyght in this quarell presente
               
                  
The eye answered and sayd I am as trewe
               As euer thou were therfore in wordes fewe
               To knowe the ryght thy wedde I vp take
               And in presence of loue we shall it shewe
               Who hath the wronge and no more noyse to make.
            
            
               Than whan desyre had herde the matere playne
               In myddes of Maye he sygned a day
               The grete quarell before loue to tarrayne
               And letters wryte and seald both to say
               With sealys of theyr armes fresshe and gay
               Eche one of them his ryght for to mayntayne
               Thus to be there in all best aray
               They made there both two theyr ꝓmysse certayne
            
            
               Than wente this worthy mershall of loue
               To telle his lorde and mayster parte and all
               Of this affraye rehersed here aboue
               And loue anone commaunded forth with all
               To make a felde where in bothe grete and small
               Myght haue theyr syght closed about with lyces
               And there with all yf I the soth say shall
               A rych scaffolde arayde with delyces.
            
            
               And whan loue had hym his charge thus tolde
               And anone was made a felde both longe & wyde
               With double lystes all of ryght good golde
               Couered with tyssewe well on euery syde
               Nabugodonosor with all his pryde
               Whiche was the rychest kynge as in his dayes
               
                  Had neuer suche one before that ylke tyde
               As was that felde with all the ryche arrayes.
            
            
               
               For in that felde were two fayre entrees
               All made of Iasper and of clere crystall
               Whiche good worke men of straunge countrees
               With baryers of passynge fyne corall
               
               Had wrought ryght well by crafte especyall
               All set with keyes made of yuery
               Whiche a locke smyth that came fro portyngale
               Fyled with a fyle smothe and craftely.
            
            
               The scaffolde of loue was made of ambre
               Founded on pyllours of ryght fayre baleys
               With warderobe an hall and also with chambre
               As though it were within a grete paleyse
               The tapettes also as the boke sayes
               Were the story of the rose the romaunce
               For louers to rede both clerkes and layes
               Were wryten ryght well with good dyamaunce.
            
            
               The chayre was also passynge fresshe and gay
               Where loue hymselfe in his estate syt sholde
               Of clere burell well polysshed soth to say
               And foure spare hawkes made of massy golde
               And on the backe there were to beholde
               Syxte carbuncles ryght well set and euen
               Whiche were clerer and bryghter many folde
               Than ben the planettes shynynge from heuen.
            
            
               The day and the houre aboue sayd
               Whan the herte sholde fyght ayenst the eye
               Loue came hym selfe with his wynges dysplayd
               Dyscendynge downe of his scafolde trewely
               And in his chayre he sat downe softely
               
                  
A robe on hym embrodered with rych stones
               And fyne perles sette full craftely
               Browderede of emeraudes for the nones.
            
            
               The flores fresshe of the crowne of loue
               And chamehyeux were made of grete rychesse
               And of clere saphers set all aboue
               All his wynges were of suche bryghtnesse
               Federed de byen en meulx doubtelesse
               As of tapyses shynynge wonderfully
               I trowe none aungelles the trouth to expresse
               Haue not theyr wynges made so plesauntly.
            
            
               He had also a bowe of vnycorne
               And two strynges made of grete substaunce
               Of golde of cypresse at eche ende
               A shefe of arowes set in ordenaunce
               To teche the louers his trace to daunce
               Federed with fyne rubyes bryght and shene
               Whiche gaue hym for a grete pleasaunce
               Poynted with dyamondes sharpe and kene.
            
            
               And whan that loue this noble god archere
               Had bowe and arowes set downe hym besyde
               Regarde his heraude with voyce inly clere
               Thryes as it was commaunded that tyde
               Called the herte that he sholde not lange abyde
               Whiche had promysed to fyght there tha day
               Ayenst the eye whiche was so full of pryde
               And not to make taryenge nor delay.
            
            
               The herte came forthe to fyght ayenst the eye
               
                  
Upon a courser couered all with larmes
               His armes were made of sorowe truely
               Also thre syghes he bare in his armes
               Paynted well vpon his cote of armes
               They appered all with pyteous wepynge
               And his swerde wt whiche he sholde do his armes
               Was tempered with sorowfull complaynynge.
            
            
               In whose companye came honoure also
               Hardynesse / prowesse / and eke gentylnesse
               Thought and good hope and many other mo
               That were of his alyaunce as I gesse
               All clothed lyke for theyr worthynesse
               With roses reed and also with lylyes whyte
               Chapelettes they had eke for theyr noblenesse
               Of lauendre a floure of grete delyte.
            
            
               And whan he entred into the fresshe felde
               Than from his hors he dessended lyghtely
               And on his knees fell downe and behelde
               This noble loue and salued hym goodly
               And a lytell after full worshypfully

               Than regarde this noble heraulde and wyse
               Called the eye before loue tapere
               Which was redy in all goodly wyse
               Armed with swete dysporte on a coursere
               Whiche to my conceyt had no where his pere
               And semed well he had no werynesse
               
                  
Couered with myrth embroded here and there
               His swerde was of solace and of lustynesse.
            
            
               Of Ioye was made his cote of armes ryche
               Fygured all with pleasaunce and gladnesse
               Ryght goodly folke also none of them lyche
               He had as happed hym beaute and prowesse

               Of peruyncle arayde all in grene
               And of mergelyne in ryght grete largesse
               His fayre coursers were couered all be dene.
            
            
               And as sone as this full noble eye
               This lystes approched on fote he lyght
               And entred in and salued curteysly
               His worshypfull lorde loue as it was ryght
               Which had made promyse with the herte to fyght
               And after wente in to his pauylyon
               All arayde with gyllofres reed and whyght
               Whiche was worthe a kynges grete raunson.
            
            
               The ordeyner of the felde named desyre
               Made come anone in to the hygh presence
               Of whiche was theyr noble lorde and fyre
               Both the herte and the eye full of prudence
               And made them swere vpon theyr conseyence
               That in theyr cause eche of them had ryght
               And to crye it in open audyence
               And not to tarye that they haue be hyght
            
            
               Than after this the herte went agayne
               Unto his tente his rest for to make
               
                  
And set hym on his sege the sothe for to fayne
               Made of eglantyne for his owne sake
               Also the eye his frendes had lete make
               A sege for hym of woderon plesauntly
               Where he made good watche I vndertake
               Upon the eye whan he sholde come trewely.
            
            
               And after came loue the felde vnto
               And chose knyghtes to awayt vpon them twayne
               Thought swete hope / and rememberaunce
               And honoure eke and I sholde not fayne
               All armed with margaretes certayne
               And eche of them bare in his hand a spere
               Of grene lauer well made both smoth & playne
               To departe these champynyons yf nede were.
            
            
               And than this loue whiche is worthy and dygne
               To whome no creature may hym resemble
               Unto regarde his heraulde made a sygne
               That he sholde make ye herte & the eye to assemble
               And whan they were thus both two assemble
               The heralde cryed do your deuour anone
               For whiche the herte and the eye began to tremble
               And so dyde they that were presente eche one.
            
            
               And thus the herte whiche was thappalaunte
               Out of his tente yssues ryght manly
               Whiche bare as he that was ryght valeaunt
               A spere heed with sorowe sekerly
               The eye from his pauylyon by and by
               Yssued also in his hande a launce
               The whiche he gyded full gentylmanly
Herte & eye.
               
                  
Poynted it was ryght fresshely with plesaunce.
            
            
               Forth with the herte hente in his fyst a spere
               Thryse byfore the eye / namly he wente
               The eye anone as he that had no fere
               Came forth a goodly pace anone of his tente
               And the herte with a good auysemente
               Cast his spere and perced the vysere
               Of the eye whiche demed hym almoost shente
               And thought he was vnto deth ryght nere.
            
            
               And whan the eye felte hym thus sore wounded
               Rudly ayenst the herte he wente anone
               And fyrst of all that his herte was founded
               His spere he caught manly and tyght soone
               Unneth the herte myght stande his fete vpon
               For he smote one of his platys a parte
               And of that stroke he had so moche to done
               That he demed that his body & soule sholde parte
            
            
               Yet for all this his herte he toke agayne
               And ryght manly his swerde anone he toke
               And on the eye he smote ryght fast certayne
               Such myghty strokes that all the grounde shoke
               And than the eye with a courageous loke
               The herte strongly he bare so with his swerde
               Ayenst the lystes and hym not for soke
               Wherof the herte was than ryght sore aferde.
            
            
               The herte sawe that he was in daungere
               And ryght nye dyscomfyted thus by the eye
               Full hardtly he cast away his spere
               And drewe his dagger well amsely
               
                  
And layde on fast and smote so feruently
               Upon the eye that he was nere attaynte
               And from his strokes he voyded lyghtly
               For whiche to couer he had grete constraynte.
            
            
               And as they fought these grete chāpyons twayne
               With theyr sharpe daggers with so grete courage
               Whiche were lyke to fall downe in the playne
               Dame pyte than that lady swete and sage
               Came forth anone with a certayne message
               To loue and prayed her crande for to here
               Ryght as he sat on hygh vpon his stage
               Whiche came from venus his owne modet dere.
            
            
               Than loue to her made glad and Ioyfull chere
               And gaue to her a welcome honourable
               Saynge thus dame pyte myn owne frende dere
               Syth my moder of her estate notable

               Hath you commaunded thus to come to me
               Thynke it is to me ryght agreable
               To here your message what so it be.
            
            
               And than pyte thanked loue ryght mekely
               Whiche was alway on knees as I rede
               Saynge ryght hygh lorde here is trewele
               A grete debate of these knyghtes in dede
               Whiche haue ben euer both in worde and dede
               Wykynge of loue the stepes for to shewe
               And of Uenus who so lyst to take hede
               Aboue all other seruauntes good and trewe.
Herte & eye.
            
            
               
               For whan Uenus herde this mortall stryfe
               That was betwene the herte and eye thus fall
               Of very loue and of herte attentyfe
               Cōsydereth the begynnynge and all
               And wote full well that her esate ryall
               Without them two may not be kepte vp ryght
               Nor her mayeste exalted be at all
               But they were redy alway in her syght.
            
            
               And for they be bothe of her courte in fere
               She now commaundeth them to call agayne
               And byfore her they bothe must nedes appere
               As for this cause thus fell betwene them twayne
               For she wolde knowe the very cause all playne
               Of theyr debate whiche to her eere appertayneth
               And wolde they were in pease full fayne
               For all suche causes vnto her perteyneth.
            
            
               Than loue for the whiche to gyue his obeyssaunce
               To his moder and wolde no more abyde
               Saynge thus she shole haue cognoyssaunce
               And there debate wolde no lenger hyde
               But called the watches that wente by theyr syde
               Chargynge them the champyons to dysioyne
               And to pyte whoos goodnesse is knowen wyde
               Delyuer both in peas them for to Ioyns.
            
            
               The pyte bad them warne them bothe
               And after wente of loue her leue to take
               And charged thē whether they were leefe or lothe
               Bytwene thē twayne no more quarelles to make
               But late theyr stryfe / an theyr debat slake
               
                  
And eschewe hate and loue togyder agayne
               What meruayle though theyr hertes dyde quake
               Towardes Uenus whan they sholde go certayne.
            
            
               By wene them wente his good lady pyte
               And led them by the handes in full frendly gyse
               And sayd to them now syth ye are with me
               I shall you two make to morowe or ye ryse
               My cosyns germayns your hate to depryse
               And Uenus shall you of one accorde
               Whiche wyll not suffre in no manere wyse
               Her owne folkes to be at dyscorde.
            
            
               Than they aryued all in a stronge yle
               That was made ryght stronge about with all
               Ofbrennynge brondes by crafte abyle
               Bycause it was so derke in especyall
               Were two foules whiche ostrydges men call
               Bare on hygh in the eyre in lettere
               Of golde enhameled of a
                     •
                  ure at all
               Uenus the goddesse of loue moost entere.
            
            
               I sawe his lettere whiche borne was so hye
               Couered with cloth of grete substaunce
               And she in whome all Ioye is moost trewly
               And gladnesse contynued with pleasaunce
               A robe of purple she had at her ordeynaunce
               With flames of fyre and sperles lyght
               Whiche was made to the suffysaunce
               Of yonge louers for comforte day and nyght
            
            
               And whan madame pyte founde there presente
Herte & eye.
               
                  
Her lady venus of loue goddesse
               With a sote salue she dyde her presente
               And sayd madame to your hygh noblenesse
               Are come these two knyghtes of grete prowess.
               The herte and the eye to knowe your entente
               Whome loue hath drede and with humblenesse
               Now at this tyme by me to you hath sente.
            
            
               To that intente that of theyr grete debate
               As ye my lady commaunded by me
               That ye myght knowe the cause of all theyr hate
               For he wolde ye had the soueraynte
               By cause he knoweth verely that ye
               Can best Iuge them as to theyr behoue
               Also he wote that ye be oonly she
               Bycause all goodnes falleth to loue.
            
            
               And than Uenus with a goodly countenaunce
               Toke to her these noble champyons
               Which had so longe at theyr vtteraunce
               With hardy hertes fought as were lyons
               Whiche trowed well in theyr opynyons
               Yf pyte had not take them into warde
               And made to staunche theyr heuy accyons
               Ony of them to scape it had ben harde.
            
            
               The herte hym set anone vp his kne
               And sayd Uenus our souerayne lady dere
               Syth it pleaseth you to knowe the certaynte
               Of our dyscord the very trew manere
               Not lyenge a worde but both playne and clere
               I shall you tell begynnynge and the ende
               
                  
Of our debate thus standynge here in fere
               Yf it please your hyghnesse now to entende.
            
            
               That forthe with venus gaue the herte lycence
               That he sholde of his cause the substaunce
               Also the eye sholde ordayne his sentence
               To answere hym in waye of replyaunce
               And eke they were charged on theyr alygeaunce
               That in theyr causes they sholde nothynge varye
               And for to stande at venus ordeynaunce
               And none of them therto say naye.
            
            
               The herte attayned his cause thus trewely
               Saynge to venus our souerayne lady goddesse
               Lo here nature hath gyuen to me the eye
               To sette me in the way of ryghtwysnesse
               To fynde Ioye / solace and also gladnesse
               And he hath taken a pyler to beholde
               The fayre plesaunte aud floure of lustynesse
               Whiche fro me parted soner than I wolde.
            
            
               And of that pleasure that the eye had take
               He warned me and that ryght sodaynly
               And than anone in me there dyde awake
               Louely desyre / and remembraunce trewly
               And lodged them in me full plesauntly
               And so dyde thought and in many other mo
               And also swete hope to holde me company
               And hap comforte lakked not also.
            
            
               And after this it happed me full yll
               For the eye had no lyst there to abyde
               
                  
Tyll I requyred as it was skyll
               Other that I had chosyn to be me gyde
               But her absentynge taught me well that tyde
               That who soeuer that is ferre from the eye
               Is ferre from the herte and thus on euery syde
               I lyue in tourmente and grete paynes trewly.
            
            
               Wherfore yf he had not thus set his syghte
               I had not be taken in the snare
               But that I had yet hope my Ioy vp ryght
               And in no wyse I sholde haue this care
               For his beholdynge causeth euyll fare
               As to me for this rale is full trewe
               That folkes say that women called are
               That the eye seeth the herte doth rewe.
            
            
               For in the eye is the gate whiche in no wyse
               Sholde not open to lete in heuynesse
               But alway sholde be redy to deuyse
               To kepe me surely from all pensyuenesse
               And lette in hope good happe and gladnesse
               Comforte and Ioye and also good auenture
               For whome he sholde do his trewe besynesse
               And not to make an hasty auenture.
            
            
               I fele well he dyde the contrarye
               For he hath lete wepynges and complayntes
               Entre in me he may not from it varye
               With whiche my Ioy with grete sorowmentes
               And all my comforte in me now attaynted is
               Whiche is to me a marterdome mortall
               Thus I conclude that by his constrayntes
               
                  
That he is causer of my sorowe all.
            
            
               Than the eye whiche hym gretly applyed
               To fynde matere to his saluacyons
               With ryght goodly aduyse anone replyed
               Unto the hertes composycyons
               And sayd I se well by his accyons
               That he hath ben at scole I trowe of loue
               Whiche bryngeth forth plesaunte Intencyon
               Hymselfe further for his owne behoue.
            
            
               And sayd lady Uenus of loue goddesse
               The herte sayth thus that he hath of nature
               Gyuen vnto hym as he doth expresse
               That he all way in gladnesse sholde endure
               Yet myght it hap by some auenture
               That he shall not in Ioye alway abounde
               For as I trowe there is no creature
               But in the contrary some tyme shall be founde.
            
            
               Yet wyll I in no wyse my selfe excuse
               But that nature me made for hym doubtlesse
               And yet forsoth he ought me not to accuse
               That he bereth by me the heuynesse
               Of sorowe nor of no manere dystresse
               For in good fayth there can nothyng be done
               Without his consente as I can expresse
               For all the cause by hym is wrought alone.
            
            
               And as the clocke may smyte in no wyse
               But that he haue some manere of moeuynge
               
               As he that kepeth hym lyst to deuyse
               
                  
So of myselfe in dede I haue nothynge
               But to beholde and then in tydynges brynge
               And thus the herte is cause of all trewly
               For without hym thus haue I no doynge
               But as an Instrumente forfoth am I
            
            
               Yf Ion her haue set all my beholdynge
               By his aduyse that causeth me therto
               And to this cause he is moost attendynge
               By his desyre her for to loue also
               Yf he absente hym and sorow come hym to
               I may not get that he lyst not to saue
               For as some say the herte the worke must do
               Yf he wyll not / I may no pleasure haue
            
            
               So my lady I praye you to take hede
               To these cau
                     •
                  es and how I me excuse
               And kepe ye well my ryght and so procede
               
                  Ayenst the herte whiche doth you obstuse
               To this intente that he shall not refuse
               But at the lest that he be take anone
               And pi
                     ••
                   
                  in  prysorn there to be recluse
               Tyll he haue amended all that is mysdone.
            
            
               Than Uenus thought well that without thē too
               She myght in no wyse her courte mayntayne
               
                  Wherfore the dyde the processe call her to
               And made to wryte the mater hole and playne
               And 
                     〈◊◊〉
                   there of sholde remayne
               In her owne hande what so euer be fall

                  She made them swere afore her folkes all.
            
            
               
               Of which trewely they were contente
               And Uenus than wrote vnto her seruauntes all
               And to all trewe louers the hole entente
               Them commaundynge both grete and small
               Eche man serche on payne that myght fall
               As to theyr aduyse whiche of them had ryght
               And this was the very cause in especyall
               There peas to make she dyde her wyll and myght
            
            
               And who coud brynge the very trewe reporte
               Of the oppenyon of this foresayd matere
               As for eyther sholde haue for his reporte
               Of her a chapelet of roses to were
               Than anone I founde all the substaunce clere
               Of my thoughtes whiche I had done byfore
               Whiche I wrote as ye haue herde me here

               And of trewe loue be set in the waye
               That of the herte and eye and the doutfull stryfe
