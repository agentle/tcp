            ¶The Popes Lamentation.
            
               O Heauen, O Earth, O Elaments,
            and all therein containde,
            Lament with me, powre forth your plaints
            iust cause hath so cōstraind,
            Sith cursed Death, in cruel wise,
            hath reft me my delight:
            
               Don Ioan of Austria
               ▪ he that sought,
            by all the meanes he might,
            To saue my church & me from harme▪
            
            to strengthen my estate,
            And with his power, to punish those
            that did my doings hate.
            
               Mine eyes sende forth, your brinish teares,
            more cause you neuer had:
            Since he is d

               ad, whose douty deedes
            erst made my hart ful glad.
            Now let my Halles be hangd about,
            with mestfull morning weed
                  •

            Come, come, my carefull Cardnalles now,
            my Prelates and the rest:
            That wonted were to wish me well,
            I pray ye all be prest.
            To waile with woe, the want of him,
            that during tearme of life:
            Neglected nought that might bee wrought
            to make our glory rife.
            Alas how am I gript with grife,
            what cares do compasse me:
            For losse of him, whom I ordainde,
            my Champion cheefe to be,
            To 
                  •
               ight with those yt were my foes,
            whom I had handled so,
            That he beleeude I was a God,
            aswell as many moe,
            
               That with my charmes I did inchaūt
            to finde his like againe
            In all the world, who so should seeke,
            would labour loose in vaine.
            And for this cause I called him,
            to state of hye degree:
            Prouoking him to that which should
            for my preferment bee.
            Ful wel my couenaūts could he keepe
            my lawes and statutes large,
            My Buls, & pardons, pleas'd him wel
            they weare his cheefest charge.
            And therfore Death, I curse thee now
            and eke thy cruel dart:
            Which did to that renowmed Prince,
            thy p

               ysoned power impart.
            These Huguenots thou mightest haue hitte,
            to pacifye thine yre,
            And let this worthy wight alone,
            to further my desyre.
            Thou hast not onely striken him,
            but diuerse more besyde:
            As by thy deadly Darte appeares,
            that in theyr blood was di'de.
            
               Thy furious force from me remooue,
            and straight thy strength extend
            Uppon a Prince whose name I hate,
            at him thy battry bende.
            So shall my sorrow somewhat cease,
            but gr
                  •
               ater griefes will growe,
            If thus thou seeke gainst me and mine
            thy rigorous rage to show.

            No meanes they seeke, but when I strike,
            they gladly graunt to dye.
