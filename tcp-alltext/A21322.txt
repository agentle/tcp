            ¶The proheme of syr Thomas
Elyot knyghte.
            GOd, vnto whome all
mens hartis be opened,
and the wyll of manne
speakethe, is my wytnes,
that to the desire of
knowlege, whervnto I haue hither
to ben euer of my nature disposed / I
haue ioyned a constant intent to profyte
therby to my natural countrey:
Whervnto acordyng to the sentence
of Tully, we be most specially boū
               den.
Wherfore after that I had applyed
the more parte of my lyfe in
perusynge diligently euery auncient
warke, that I mought come by / eyther
greke or latine, conteyninge any
parte of philosophie necessary to the
institution of mans lyfe in vertue, I
haue endeuored my selfe to set forth
such part of my studie as I thought
mought be profitable to them, whiche

shulde happen to rede or here it.
But diuers men rather scornyng my
benefite than receyuing it thankfully
doo shewe them selfes offended (as
they say) with my strange termes.
            Other finding in my bokis the thing
dispreysed / whiche they do cōmende
in vsynge it. Lyke a galde horse abidynge
no playsters be alwaye gnappynge
and kyckynge at suche examples
and sentences as they do feele
sharpe or do byte them / accomptyng
to be in me no lyttell presumption,
that I wylle in notynge other mens
vices correct Magnificat, sens other
moche wyser men and better lerned
than I, doo forbeare to wryte any
thynge. And whiche is warse than
all this: Some wyll maliciously diuine
or coniecte that I wryte to the
intent to rebuke some perticuler persone
couaytinge to brynge my warkes
and afterward me into the indignation
of some man in auctorytie.
            
               
Thus vnthankfully is my benefyte
receyued / my good wyll consumed,
and all my labours deuoured. Such
is of some menne the nature serpentine,
that lappyng swete mylke they
conuerte hit forthe with in to poyson,
to distroy hym of whose liberalitie
they late had receyued it. How
incomparable be these men vnlyke
to the most excellent prince our most
dere soueraygne lorde? whose most
royall persone I hartily beseche god
to preserue in longe life and honour.
His highnesse benignely receyuynge
my boke / whiche I named the Gouernour,
in the redynge therof sone
perceyued that I intended to augment
our Englyshe tongue, wherby
men shulde as well expresse more abundantly
the thynge that they conceyued
in theyr hartis (wherfore language
was ordeyned) hauynge wordes
apte for the pourpose: as also
interprete out of greke, latyn / or any

other tonge into Englysshe, as sufficiently / 
as out of any one of the said
tongues into an other. His grace also
perceyued / that through out the
boke there was no terme new made
by me of a latine or frenche worde,
but it is there declared so playnly by
one mene or other to a diligent reder
that no sentēce is therby made derke
or harde to be vnderstande. Ne the
sharpe and quycke sentences, or the
rounde and playne examples set out
in the versis of Claudiane the poete
in the seconde boke / or in the chapiters
of Affablitie, Beneuolence, Beneficence / 
and of the diuersitie of flaterers / 
and in dyuers other places / in
any parte offended his hyghnes: but
(as hit was by credible persones reported
vnto me) his grace not onely
toke hit in the better parte, but also
with princely wordes ful of maiestie
cōmēded my diligēce / simplicite & corage
in that I spared none astate in

the rebukynge of vice: which wordes
full of very nobilite brought vnto
my remembraunce the vertuous
Emperour Antonine, called for his
wysdom Antonine the philosopher,
who on a tyme herynge that there
was in the Citie of Rome a playne &
rude persone / whiche alwaye spake
in the rebuke of all men, and neuer
praised any man: he sent to hym / requirynge
that he wolde come and
speke with hym. And whan he was
come, the Emperour had these wordes
vnto hym. My frende / wherin
haue I euer offended the? The felow
therwith soore abasshed answered
in this wise. Sir your hyghnes neuer
offended me, that I am ware of.
Than art thou (sayd the Emperour)
an vncourtoyse subiecte, that thou
haste so longe dissembled with me,
not tellyng vnto me my faultes.
            And after the Emperoure reteyned
hym styll gyuyng vnto hym dowble

wages / commaundynge hym to vse
his olde libertie. And whan dyuers
men meruayled therat, he affirmed
openly, that princis vices were sooner
espied by other men thā by them
selfes: and that there was moche
more difficultie in remembring them
of their vice or lack, than in extolling
and commendynge their vertues.
            So well dyd this mooste noble Emperour
consider, that his exaumple
mought be more profitable vnto the
publyke weale of the citie, than any
other thynge in his persone or dignitie.
            ¶In lyke wise our moste dere soueraygne
lorde perfectly knew that no
writar ought to be blamed, whiche
wryteth neyther for hope of temporall
rewarde / nor for any priuate disdayne
or malyce, but onely of feruēt
zele towarde good occupation and
vertu. Perdie man is not so yet cōformed
in grace, that he can not do syn.

And I suppose no prince thynkethe
hym selfe to be exempte from mortalitie.
And for as moche as he shall
haue mo occasiōs to fall, he ought to
haue the moo frendes or the more
instruction to warne hym. And as
for my parte I eftesones do protest,
that in no boke of mi making I haue
intended to touche more one manne
than an nother. For there be Gnathos
in Spayne as wel as in Grece,
Pasquilles in Englande as welle as
in Rome, Dionises in Germanye as
welle as in Sicile, Harpocrates in
France as wel as in Aegipt, Aristippus
in Scotlande as well as in Cyrena,
Platos be fewe, and them I
doubte where to fynde. And if men
wyll seke for them in Englande / whiche
I sette in other places, I can nat
lette them. I knowe well ynowghe
dyuers do delyte to haue theyr garmentes
of the facion of other countreyes,
and that whiche is mooste

playne is vnplesant: but yet it doth
happen sometyme that one man beynge
in auctorytie or fauour of his
prince, beinge sene to weare sommething
of the old facion: for the strāgenes
therof it is taken vp ageine with
many good felowes. What I doo
meane euery wyse man perceyueth.
Touchynge the title of my boke, I
considered that wisedome is spoken
of, moch more than vsed. For wher
in it resteth fewe menne be sure. The
commune opinion is into thre partis
deuided. One sayeth it is in moche
lernynge and knowledge. An other
affirmeth / that they whiche do conducte
the affayres of greatte princis
or countrayes, be onely wyse
men. Nay saythe the thyrde, he is
wysest that leste dothe meddle, and
can sytte quietly at home and tourne
a crabbe, and looke onely vnto his
owne busynesse. Nowe they whiche
be of the fyrste oppinion be alwaye

at varyance. For somme doo
chiefly extoll the study of holy scripture
(as it is rayson) but while they
do wrest it to agree with theyr willes,
ambition, or vayne glory, of the
mooste noble and deuoute lernynge,
they doo endeuor them to make hit
seruile and full of contention. Some
do preferre the studie of the lawes
of this realme, callynge it the onely
studye of the publyke weale. But a
great noumbre of persones, whiche
haue consumed in sute more thanne
the value of that, that they used for,
in theyr angre do cal it a cōmune detriment.
All thoughe vndoubtedly
the verye selfe lawe trewely practised / 
passeth the lawes of all other
countrayes. In thynkynge on these
sondrye opynyons, I happened
for my recreacyon to reede in the
booke of Laertius the lyfe of Plato,
and beholdynge the aunswere
that he made to kynge Dyonyse,

at the fyrste syghte it semed to me to
be very dissolute and lackyng the modestie
that belōged to a philosopher:
but whan I had better examined it,
therein appered that whiche is best
worthy to be called wysedome.
            Wherfore to exercyse my wytre, and
to auoyde Idelnes, I toke my penne
and assayde / Howe in expressyng my
conceyte I mought profyte to them,
whiche without disdayne or enuye
wolde often tymes reade it. If any
man wyll thinke the boke to be very
longe, let hym consyder, that knowlege
of wysedome can not be shortly
declared. All be hit of them whiche
be well wyllinge it is soone lerned,
in good faythe sooner thanne
Primero or Gleeke: Suche is the
straunge propretie of that excellent
counnynge, that it is sooner lerned,
than taught, and better by a mannes
rayson than by an instructour.
            Finally if the reders of my warkis,

by the noble example of our mooste
dere soueraygne lorde do iustly and
louyngely interprete my labours, I
durynge the residue of my lyfe wyll
nowe and than sette forthe suche
frutes of my study profitable (as I
trust) vnto this my countray. And leuynge
malycious reders with their
incurable fury, I wyll say vnto god
the wordes of the Catholike Churche
in the booke of Sapience:Sap̄. 15. To
knowe the good lorde is perfecte
Iustice / And to knowe thy Iustyce
and vertue is the very roote of Immortalite:
And therin is the knowlege
that is very wysedome.

            ARISTIPPVS. PLATO.
            
               ARISTIPPVS.
               VVho is this mā / whom
I perceyue commynge
hitherwarde? It semeth
to be Plato. Let
me se? It is verily Plato
him selfe. What meaneth it / that
he is in this wise aparailid? His garmentes
be very short / and more simple
thā he was accustomed to were.
Well, though there were some debate
betwene vs in Sicile, yet wyll
I salute him / and desire him to shew
to me the state of all his affaires.
               For in wyse men resteth no malice / 
all though diuersitie in opinions or
forme of lyuinge causeth sometyme
contention betwene them. Plato / 
thou art wel founden againe in this
contray.
            
            
               PLATO.
               Gramercie Aristippus.
But yet thou hast sayde
truer thā I wene thou arte ware of.
            
            
               
               ARISTIP.
               Why, I knowe the to
be Plato, though thou be in this single
apparaile.
            
            
               PLA.
               Ye that I suppose.
But thou saydest that I was
wel founden: And in dede thou saydest
true after the cōmune opinion.
for sens thou departiddest from Sicile
I haue ben twise in the poynt to
haue died / and also twise solde for a
bondeman or slaue. Wherfore thon
mayst with good rayson say, that I
am well founden, that haue bene so
often in perile to be loste. For commenly
men do calle hym lost, which
despayreth of his lyfe / or of a free
man is made a slaue. But whither
that opinion be true or no, we shall
speke more therof hereafter. Finally
Aristippus (god be thanked) I am
well eskaped.
            
            
               ARI.
               I do not a litle
meruaile of this that thou tellist me.
For whan I went from kinge Dionise,
he mought not suffer, that thou
moughtist be one houre from him.
               
                  
Moreouer he regarded nothynge
that was spoken, except it were by
thy sentence approued. In the mornynge
as sone as he was out of his
bedde Plato was sent for. Vneth
Dion and Aristomenes coulde gette
of hym one houre in the daye / that
thou moughtist teache them and other
towardely gentilmen such part
of Philosophie as they desyred to
lerne. Finally for the incomparable
fauour that the kynge bare to the,
thou were had in the courte almoste
in as moche reuerence as the kinges
owne person. And whan thou passiddest
by, noble men & other of the
kinges household / wold rise quickely
& as a storme had fallē in their neckes,
ducke to the with theyr heddis
vncouered: yet diuers in theyr mindes
grutched at thy fortune, thinkinge
that the great pleasure / that
the kinge had in communinge with
the / withdrewe hym from heringe

of other men, of whome there was
a great noumbre, which had / some
commune some priuate causis to
treate of with hym, if they mought
by thine absence haue founde oportunitie.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou sayest trouth
Aristippus / & that perceiue I more
clerely now, than I did before those
thinges hapned vnto me. But now
wyll I recite the my storie.
               ¶Sone after that thou haddist optained
licence of the king to go vnto
Athenes / he becam wonderful stourdie,
in so moche as no man mought
blame any thing / wherin he delited:
nor prayse any thinge, whiche was
contrary to that / that he vsed. And
that sobre and gentyll maner in heringe
sondry opinions raisoned before
hym / whereto of a custome he
was wōt to prouoke the & me, was
laide aparte / and supposinge that by
heringe of sondry philosophers dispute
and raison, he him selfe had attayned

to a more perfect knowledge
thā any other that spake vnto hym,
began to haue all other men in contempte.
And as it were Iupyter / 
who (as Homere saythe) with a
wynke made all heuen to shake / he
wold with a terrible countenaunce
so visage them / whome he knewe
wold speake theyr opinions freely,
that they shulde dreede to saye any
thinge / which they knewe shulde be
contrary vnto his appetite. Not
withstandynge on a tyme he willed
me to declare in his presence the maiestie
of a kynge, and howe moch he
excelled and was aboue the astate of
any other person: which request I
gladly herde / thinkinge to haue had
good oportunitie to warne hym of
his blyndenes and foly. Therfore
I began to commende the perfect ymage
or fygure of god, which was
manifest in the astate of a king, who
ruled hym selfe and his people for

the vniuersal weale of them al. And
whan I had described his auctorite
and preeminence by the excellency of
his vertues: prouinge that nothyng
moughte be amended, but by that
whiche surmounted or was better
than it whiche was to be corrected / 
as vice by vertu, falshode by truthe,
wrong by Iustice, foly by wisedom,
ignoraunce by lernynge / and such other
lyke. Afterward I studiousely
dyd sette out a Tyraunte in his propre
colours, who attendeth to his
owne priuate commoditie.
               ¶Here at kynge Dionise frowned
and became angry. And interruptynge
my wordes sayd vnto me:
               This is a tale of old fooles / that can
not be otherwyse occupied. And I
aunswered agayne, that those wordes
of his / sauored of Tyranny.
            
            
               ARI.
               I meruaile Plato that thou
spakest, so vnavisedly: I do meane,
sens thou knewest wel inough kinge

Dionise nature and disposicion / that
thou perceuinge hym to be meued,
woldest so sodaynly imbrayde hym
of his wordes so despitefully.
            
            
               PL.
               Well as for that / we shal raison ther
of hereafter. Finally I was wel auised
what I wolde speke: but nowe
wyl I tell furth my tale, what hapned
afterward to me.
               ¶Syr, the kynge beinge inflamed
with fury / furthwith wolde haue
slaine me. But beinge intreated importunately
by Dion and Aristomenes
he withdrewe his sentence / not
withstandynge to the intente that
he wolde be auenged, he gaue me to
Polidis / who was thanne Ambassadour
sente to hym from the Lacedemonians.
Who hadde me with
hym to Aegina, and there solde me.
Nowe a littell before there was an
ordinaunce made in that Countray,
that if any man of Athenes came in
to that Ile, he shulde immediately

lose his hedde: whiche ordinaunce
was made by Charmander thanne
beinge capitayne of that countray / 
who espieng me / and knowing who
I was, caused me to be apprehended
and brought vnto the place of
Iudgement / requiringe that on me
his sayd ordinaunce mought be put
in execution. Whervnto I made no
defence, but takynge myne aduenture
paciently, and contemning deth
as it became me / I abode my Iugement.
At the last one, eyther in despite / 
or of purpose to saue therby
my lyfe, spekinge openly and with a
loude voyce, sayde to Charmander
and the Iudges: The ordinaunce if
it be well perceyued, is made again
men of Athenes: but Plato (that is
here) is a philosopher. Which wordes,
as it hapned / were well taken &
lawghed at of all them that were
present. And therewith they discharged
me of the sayde penaltie.
               
                  
All be hit for the hostilitie that was
than betwene them & Athenes they
wolde not lette me freely departe,
but decreed that I shulde efte soones
be solde. There hapned to be at
that time Aniceris, which dwelleth
at Cyrenas / a man well lerned, who
payed for me. xx. li. and furthwith
deliuering to me his seruant, whom
thou beholdist here, hath sent me as
thou seest home to my contray: The
garmentes that I weare, he that
boughte me of Polidis toke frō one
of his slaues / and gaue them vnto
me, whan he hadde taken from me
myne apparaile that I brought out
of Sicile: whiche as thou knowest
was right honest and competent.
               Not withstandinge neither the crueltie
of king Dionise, nor the malicious
decree of the Aeginites mought
remoue my courage from vertu and
truthe / no more than the twise sellynge
of me, nor this vile habite of a

slaue or bondman may chaūge mine
astate or condicion.
               ¶But nowe Aristippus I wyll answere
the to that / wherein thou semest
to blame me of imprudence or
litenes: sayinge, thou meruay leste
that I wolde speake so vnauisedly / 
sens I knewe the nature of kynge
Dionise and his disposition. Remē
                  brist
thou not, that my comminge in
to Sicile was to beholde the wonderfull
mountaines / which do sende
out of the toppes of them great flames
of fyre and smoke, & to inserche
out the naturall causis therof? And
that all though the kynge sent often
tymes for me / yet wolde I not come
vnto hym, for as moche as thrugh
all Grece he was named a Tiraunt.
At the laste he sente vnto me Dion / 
which is a man as thou knowest of
honour and grauitie almost incomparable:
who said vnto me that the
kynge was incredibly meued with

desyre to se me, for the greatte fame
(as he affirmed) of wisedome and
knowledge / all thoughe I my
selfe knowe no suche thyng / to be in
me. And moreouer the same Dion
shewed me, that he supposed moch
profite shuld happen to the royalme
of Sicile by our metynge and communication / 
the kinge presently beholdynge
and herynge in me that,
wherof he hathe so great expectation:
that is to saye (as I moughte
vse Dions worde) vertue and wisedome.
            
            
               ARI.
               In dede I herde not
onely Dion, but also dyuers other
reporte euery thynge as thou haste
spoken.
            
            
               PLATO.
               Than thou knowest,
that the kynge feruently desired
to se me.
            
            
               ARI.
               That is truthe.
            
            
               PLA.
               And moreouer to speake also
with me.
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye verely.
            
            
               PLA.
               Bycause he herde good reporte of
me.
            
            
               ARI.
               So it appereth.
            
            
               PLA.
               Supposist thou Aristippus / that the

reporte of wisedome and vertue is
good in a Tyrantes opinion?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye as longe as he thinketh that nothinge
that is spoken or done repugnith
agaynst his affections.
            
            
               PLA.
               What afterwarde?
            
            
               ARI.
               He accompteth
it but a vanitie / iudginge
as sicke mē, nothing to be good, that
agreeth not with the sent of his appetite.
            
            
               PLA.
               Nowe in good faith
though thou thy selfe hast a delicate
mouthe / and thy taste distempred,
yet I can the thanke: for nowe thou
sayest truely. But it semeth to the,
that whā Dionise sēt for me, he thā
thought that wisedome and vertue
were good / & that I hauing thē (as
it was reported) was a good man:
and therfore he desyred to se me.
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye so it semeth.
            
            
               PLA.
               And
men do desyre to se a thinge eyther
for the beautie therof / whiche causeth
them to loue it, or for the strangenes
therof, wherby they be meued

to wonder at it / or for commoditie
that they before haue receyued
by hit.
            
            
               ARI.
               I thinke thou sayest
truely.
            
            
               PLA.
               But excepte I be deceyued
by false myrrors, or lyke to
chaungeable louers / which do mislyke
the beautie, wherof they haue
dayly fruition / perchaunce I contempne
that in my selfe / whiche I
wold prayse in an other, I am neytherin
beautie nor personage to be
compared to an infinite noumbre of
yonge men / which be in Greece, and
also in this royalme of Sicile. Besides
that, I am now aboue the age
of fourtie yeres, and haue also trauailed
in to dyuers contraies to seke
for wisedome / wherby the forme &
strength of my body is not a littell
appayred. Moreouer thankes be to
god, I suppose there is neyther stature
nor forme in my personage so
ferre out of iuste measure or fascion / 
where at any man can fynd occasion

to wonder or meruayle. And as for
any commoditie that kinge Dionise
hath receiued of me / before my comminge
vnto him / I can not perceyue
what it shuld be / sens I neuer wrate
vnto hym / nor neuer before was in
his cōpani: what thinkest thou was
than the cause that he desired to se
me?
            
            
               AR.
               What els, but to the intēr
that hauinge the in his presence, he
mought in demaundinge of the, here
that declared by thy mouth: wherfore
thou were called a wise man / &
if thou diddest expresse the same in
thy demenure & countenance / which
helpeth moche (as I mought saye)
to the ratifienge of good opinion.
            
            
               PLA.
               What sayest thou? Doeth
demeanure and countenaunce ratifie
the opinion of wisedome?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye
veryly so thynke I.
            
            
               PLA.
               What
meanest thou thereby?
            
            
               ARI.
               For
accordynge to the profession or qualitie / 
wherin men haue opinion that

wisedome doeth rest / so ought to be
the forme of lyuinge / countenaunce,
and gesture: which ioyned all to gether
maketh one hole and perfecte
harmonie / whiche sendeth in to the
hartes of the beholders and herers
a voluptie or feruent dilectation.
            
            
               PLA.
               I can the thanke Aristippus / 
thou haste nowe declared to haue
ben (as I was) the disciple of Socrates.
And if thou woldest extend
voluptie no further (whiche thou
so moche praysest) than thou haste
done now / there shuld neuer be contention
betwene vs, but folowinge
directly the doctrine and steppes of
our maister Socrates, not onely we
two shulde agree in our opinions / 
and forme of liuinge / whiche shulde
make that harmony, wherof thou
spekest. For all men that knowe vs
bothe by the vnitie of oure doctrine
shulde be brought to insue one conformitie
of lyuinge, or at the leste couayte

to folowe it / wherin shuld be
a perfecte harmony. The hole quiar
synging in one tune. Where, by the
discorde of our two doctrines, men
doubtinge which of vs two speketh
most truely / I commendinge the voluptie
or perfect dilectation / whiche
is in knowlege / thou preferringe the
voluptie of the body & sences, they
be deuided in to sondry opinions:
some extollynge myne admonicions
as more pure and separate from the
nature of beastes, and therfore approchinge
nere vnto diuinitie: other
more sensuall and hauinge lasse rayson,
do imbrace thy persuasions, as
more illecebrouse or dilectable / callinge
thy doctrine more natural and
of lasse arrogance: many there be,
whiche do couayte lernynge & wisedome / 
but hauynge not theyr myndes
sufficiently purged of affectes / 
but eyther by nature, or by yll bringinge
vp inclininge alwaye to pleasaunte

motions or appetites of the
body they admitte them gladly.
               But while they studye to folowe
bothe oure doctrines: they of all other
do make the greattest discorde
and vnperfect musike. For whanne
they wold seme to extolle the dilectation
in knowlege / they auaunce it
meruaylously in theyr disputations
& raisoninges: but in pursuing theyr
affectis and wantō apetites they destroy
their fyrst opinion: And vainly
do inforce them to make a concorde
betwene that whiche of theyr own
nature be most repugnant. Whiche
discorde dissolueth that harmony,
wherof thou spakest: for men beholdinge
in one person suche instabilitie,
they semblably do wander in
sondry opinions / nowe praysinge
one and vsinge an other, as occasion
hapneth. But here wyll I leue to
dispute any more in this matter / lest
I moughte happen to refricate the

late variaunce betwene the and me / 
and nowe wyll I retourne agayne
where I was.
               ¶I trowe thou saydest / that according
to the profession or qualitie,
wherin men haue opinion that wise
dome doeth reste, so ought to be the
forme of lyuinge, countenaunce / and
gesture. In good say the I suppose
thou sayest truely. For if Lais the
harlot / in whome thou takest pleasure
in fulfyllinge thy carnall appetite,
shulde shewe her selfe to the in
fluttisshe and vile apparaile, her hed
vnkempt / her face and handes soiled
and imbrued with grece of the potage
that she had eaten, and her legges
and fete spotted with myar / beholdynge
the with a stourdy countenaunce:
thou shuldest not be moch
moued to imbrace and kysse her, all
thoughe she spake to the wordes
wanton and amorouse, and after the
custome of harlots / prayse the with

rebukes, and rebuke the with prayses.
In likewyfe if Diogenes / who
(as thou knowest) contempneth all
thynge saue onely pouertie, wolde
stonde in the market place with his
berde cleane shauen, and his heare
trussed vp in a caule of golde / and hauinge
on his fingers ringes with diamandes
and rubies / and on his
legges fyne hosen well garded, and
shoen of the trimmest fascion, And
bycause perchance it is wynter, and
therfore the wether is colde / hauing
a pan with hote coles standinge at
his elbowe: If he wolde rebuke
the people of to moch curiositie and
delicate lyuinge / and prayse wylfull
pouertie and apparaile, that onely
seruen for necessitie, also wolde exhorte
them to contemne or despise al
ryches and honour / and to imbrace
paynfulnes: Thinkest not thou that
they wold laugh him to scorne / and
accompt hym for a dissarde or with

to moche studie fallen in to a frensie?
            
            
               ARI.
               Yes be my trouth, for it were
a maruayllous foly.
            
            
               PLA.
               And
why supposest thou?
            
            
               ARI.
               For
the fresshe apparaile and riches that
he sheweth / openly declareth to all
men that he therin deliteth & taketh
plesure. And that wherin a mā doth
delite, in deliting therin he prayseth
it: than is it not a great folishnes to
praise & disprayse / as it were in one
instante? That is to saye in vse to cō
                  mende
a thynge openly / and in wordes
to disprayse it expressly. And it
shulde seme to the beholders, that
he exhorteth mē to contemne riches / 
that he mought be riche onely. And
that he persuadeth them to sustayne
cold & other paines, that he mought
take his ease & syt by the fire / whiles
other men laboured. Wherfore if
they regarded littell his counsaile / 
they were not to be blamed.
            
            
               PLA.
               Yes, his counsayle perchaunce were

to be consydered, whether it were
expedient or no: but surely his persone
and discretion were to be littell
estemed. Nowe Aristippus, thou
thinkest that kynge Dionise desyred
to se me, to the intēt that he mought
beholde, if in my countenaunce and
forme of lyuinge I dyd expresse that
thinge / wherfore he herde me commended.
And it semeth, that therin
the kynge declared hym selfe to be a
very wise man, that he trusted more
to the act, than to wordes or opinion.
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye truly he hath a sharp
witte, and in that a manne mought
wel praise his ymagination.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thanne what thinkest thou Aristippus?
If I shulde haue layde a parte
myne owne aparaile, & haue bought
suche as thou wearest / garded and
decked with golden buttons / supposest
thou not that whā I cam to his
presence / and that he sawe me, in
such wise aparailed, he wold thinke

that I wold speke of the dilectation
that is felte in medlynge with fayre
women and pleasant: or in the sondry
diuersities of swete sauours / &
tastes of metes / that the cooke hathe
wel seasoned: and in other like thinges,
in whose effectes thou determinest
to be perfecte felicitie? Than
bicause he hath before herde the dispute
as abundauntly therof as any
mannes witte mought ymagine, he
wold littell esteme my comminge / 
and thinke the reporte, which was
made of me, to be false. But if he
wold vouchefaufe to tary, than if I
disputed of fortitude, temperaunce,
and other lyke vertues, and there
with exhorted him and other princes,
to abstayne and be continente / 
blaminge theyr auarice, lechery, &
other dissolute maners / with theyr
curiositie & superfluouse apparaile:
Supposest thou not that he wolde
lawgh at me / and in mockage bede

me chaunge myne apparaile?
            
            
               ARI.
               Nay, paraduenture he wolde commaunde
one to fetche for you a furred
hoode to saue with your honestie.
            
            
               PLA.
               Ah, kynge Dionise is
beholding vnto the. For thou woldest
that men shulde thinke / that he
were of great modestie. But what
if before that he herde me speke, he
had caused me to sytte with hym at
souper / and there behelde me feede
errantly / perusinge all the delicate
disshes: and thereto dranke stoutly
of euery cuppe that was offred me:
and after souper / with suche wenches
as were presente, deuise wantonly / 
and also playe and dalie, excedynge
the termes of honestie, but
whan I behelde him do the semblable,
I wolde than commende sobrenesse / 
and dispraise gloteny: cōmende
excedingely continence, and dispraise
vehemently wanton daliaunce and
lechery: howe moche trowest thou

wold he than sette by me?
            
            
               ARI.
               As
moch as of a good foole / that shuld
make hym mery. For he wold take
al thy wordes but for iapery.
            
            
               PLA.
               I wene thou sayest truely. Nowe
lette vs inserche somwhat on the other
parte. Whan Dion broughte
me vntill hym / and that he behelde
me cladde in apparaile conuenient &
semely to my profession, neither seāt
nor superfluous / neyther most rude,
nor yet sumptuous, my countenance
therto equiualent, which (be it spoken
withoute any boste) with great
study and diligence, I haue prepared
to haue alwaye in suche a temperance / 
that it shall neuer be founden
dissolute or lyghte / nor yet froward
or stourdy / thinkest thou that
he had than good opinion of me?
and thought that the wisedom and
vertue was in me, which men had
reported?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye vndoubtedly / 
and therfore he reioiced moche at

thy commynge.
            
            
               PLA.
               For any other
thinge trowest thou, than bycause
I was wise and vertuouse, as
he iudged by mine apparaile & countenance?
And that he hoped to here
of me some wisedome declared?
            
            
               ARI.
               No truely / but euen for that
cause onely.
            
            
               PLA.
               On my faythe
Aristippus thou well doest deserue
the greatte giftes and benefites that
thou haste receyued of kynge Dionise / 
sens thou so diligently hast affirmed
hym to be the louer of wisedome.
For in that, that he couayted
to here it declared / he desyred it,
and no man wold desyre that thing
that he loueth not.
            
            
               AR.
               So I suppose.
            
            
               PLA.
               But yet hereafter it
shall appiere contrary: But for this
time admitte thy persuasion of king
Dionise to be true / that he fauored
wisedome and vertue, and that he
hoped to here it declared better by
me than by other. If nowe he sytting

& studiously applienge his eares
to gyue me good audience, shulde
here me commende the plesure that
is in sumptuous and pleasaunt housis,
in rich apparaile and tapestries,
in plentie of goodly and fayre concubines / 
in abundaunce of delicate
meates and drinkes / and heapynge
vp great treasour of money and iewelles:
thinkest not thou / that I
spake contrary to his expectation / 
whiche he had of me by the reporte
of my lyuinge, confermed by myne
apparaile and countenance, as thou
late affirmiddest? Thinkest thou
that he wolde not haue thoughte / 
that eyther I had mocked hym, or
flatered hym, if he hath so sharpe a
witte and quicke inuencion as thou
doest suppose hym to haue, and therfore
haue caused me to be expelled
oute of his palice, as a counterfayte
dysarde or spie? Or aunswering me
that of suche thinges as I commended

he had more knowlege and experience
than I / and therfore in vain
I laboured to declare that to hym,
whiche I knew moche lasse than he
hym selfe dyd? Sayenge that he couayted
to here of me, what wisedome
was, wherof he had herde so
many diuers opinions: And wherin
as the reporte was made vnto him,
I was iustructed sufficiently, wherfore
he wolde requyre me to declare
that onely vnto hym / which he supposed
I knewe better than he dyd.
            
            
               ARI.
               It is very likely that he wold
haue done so.
            
            
               PLA.
               If thou haddest
than ben there Aristippus / woldest
thou haue coūsailed me to haue
resisted that gentyl princis request,
who with suche humanitie, as thou
hast herde of, so moche desyred to se
me / and to here me speke?
            
            
               ARI.
               Nay that wold I not.
            
            
               PLA.
               Than
thou woldest that I shulde satisfie
his desyre?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye truely.
            
            
               PLA.
               
                  
After that he had sene me, what remayned?
            
            
               ARI.
               To here the speke.
            
            
               PLA.
               Any otherwyse than he had
opinion of me?
            
            
               ARI.
               No verily.
            
            
               PLA.
               And accordinge as myne apparaile / 
and countenance pretended,
so I shuld do?
            
            
               ARI.
               Accordynge.
            
            
               PLA.
               Not vsurping thy profession
in persuadinge to hym thinges that
were dilectable, or praysinge the dissolute
forme of his lyuinge, not onely
contrary to myne apparaile and
countenaunce / but also whiche I my
selfe do aborre / and haue alway reproued
openly.
            
            
               ARI.
               No / that dissimulation
were to foule and apparant / 
and shulde haue sette hym (as
thou say dest while ere) in great displeasure
with the / supposinge that
thou haddest mocked hym.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thā woldest thou not, that I shuld
haue vsed any dissimulatiō: for thou
supposest that kynge Dionise wolde
haue bene therwith displeased. It

semeth therfore that thou cōcludest / 
that I shulde tell hym truthe / & accordinge
to my profession.
            
            
               ARI.

misery.
            
            
               ARI.
               I knowe well thou

               PL.
               What sayest thou Aristippus / 
is not wisedome knowledge? Or
what thynge is it els?
            
            
               ARI.
               Why
doest thou aske me that question / 
wherof no man maketh any doubt?
            
            
               PLA.
               For I feared leste thou woldest
haue sayde, that the vsinge of
thinges dilectable had ben wisedom
onely.
            
            
               ARI.
               But not withoute
knowlege, wherof procedeth election.

For than shuld I haue affirmed / 
that a hors / which deliteth in etyng / 
a dogge in hunting, a gote in lechery,
did it by wisedom: wherby I shuld
proue my selfe to be folisshe and ignoraunt.
Moreouer I am of that
opinion, that a wyse man liueth not
alway in voluptie or pleasaunt dilectation / 
but that for the more parte

                     〈◊〉
                   is so affectioned. Also withoute
knowlege the troubles & impedimē
                  tes
wherby dilectatiō is letted / may
not be comprehende to be eschewed.
            
            
               PLA.
               Well than / although in the
affect of dilectation we two disagre / 
thou preferrynge the dilectations of
the flesshe before the dilectations of
the soule / I condemnyng all such affection
do vtterli seuer it from wisedome:
yet we do agree / that knowledge
is euer in a wyse man. But
what knowlege meanest thou? The
knowledge of a good horse from a
bad / a hole shepe from a cothed, or

suche other lyke? Or els the knowledge
howe to buylde a fayre house,
or how to sette trees, that in a littell
space of time thou maist haue a faire
orcharde?
            
            
               ARI.
               That knowlege
is good.
            
            
               PLA.
               Yea and procedeth
of a sharp wit / but yet it is not that
knowledge that maketh hym / that
hath it, to be a wise man.
            
            
               ARI.
               I suppose not.
            
            
               PLA.
               What sayest
thou by him, that findeth the menes
to gather great sommes of money / 
offices, or greatte possessions with
littel labour: thinkest thou not him
to haue that knowledge / which we
calle wisedome?
            
            
               ARI.
               It approcheth
very nigh, but I dare nat affirme
it to be so, bycause I se dayly,
that the most parte of those persons
happeneth to suche thinges more by
fortune than by theyr owne merites
or Industry.
            
            
               PLA.
               On my fayth I
loue the Aristippus / for nowe thou
sayest truely. What they / whiche

from a poore astate do come to gret
rule and auctorite, shal I name them
all wise men?
            
            
               ARI.
               Moche lasse
thanne the other. For besides that
that fortune hath also there no littel
porcion, it moreouer dependeth not
on the power, witte, or diligence of
him, that commeth to auctoritie, but
holly on the wyl of a second person / 
that is to say of him that promoteth
him to it. Wherfore haue he moch
witte or none, as he shall like or content
the person that maye aduaunce
hym, so shall he come to auctoritie.
Wherfore sens it hapneth not onely
of his own study, I se no cause why
to call hym a wise manne.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou spekest very wel and raysonably / 
but what supposest thou them
to be, which in euery mater, that is
meued, canne raison fetely, makyng
men that do here them / wonder at
their conueyance, thoughe it be somtyme
ferre from the purpose? be not

they wise men? And that thing that
they haue, is it not the very knowlege,
that maketh wisedom?
            
            
               ARI.
               No, but it is a good parte of inuencion,
which commeth of witte. All
be it bycause that whiche they do
rayson is neuer certayne, it is rather
opinion than wisedome, and also
that maner of prompte raysonynge
hapneth more of nature than study,
and therfore it is more commended
of vulgare persones or ignoraunte:
than of them which be of a ripe and
perfect iugement.
            
            
               PLA.
               Perchance
thou sayst truely: yet may it also be
in them that be wise, not as wisedome
it selfe, but as a setter furthe
of wisedome to hym that hereth / 
like as the painter hathe the very ymage
in his mynde, but whanne he
wold that other men shuld perceiue
it, he on a table with sondry colours
paynteth it / and setteth it furth:
               And yet if the paynter do not before

he warketh / & in the payntynge, conceiue
in his mind the hole proporcion
of the image whā it is painted, it
shal lacke his ꝑfectiō. And although
the freshe colours and vernishe maketh
it pleasaunt to the eyen of the
commune people, and them that be
ignorant, yet to good warke men / &
to them that haue beholden manye
parfecte peces, and delyted therin,
the imperfeccyon of the warke is
shortly perceiued: euen so knowlege / 
wherin is wisedome / beinge ones
truely hadde, if it be wel sette furthe
with eloquēce and raison / it shal the
better please and profite the herers.
But if he that speketh / doo lacke
that knowlege / howe so euer the
beautye of his wordes and rayson
shall content the eares of them that
be ignorant, yet therof shall come to
them but litell profite. And to them
that haue tasted some thinge of that
knowlege / the errour or lacke shall

sone be espied. But now what supposest
thou is the knowlege, which
we haue all this while talked of?
and that wherin that wisedome is / 
for the which kinge Dionise desyred
to se me / and to here me speke, and
the whiche accordynge to my profession / 
apparaile / and countenaunce,
and to the expectation that he had
of me / I declared vnto hym?
            
            
               ARI.
               I wote not Plato, therfore I praye
the telle me to shorten oure communication.
            
            
               PLA.
               I am content / but
yet with a condicion / that is to saye,
whan I demaunde of the any question / 
thou shalt speke euen as thou
thinkest, without inforcinge any raison
to maynteine therwith thine old
opinion.
            
            
               ARI.
               Therto I assent for
this tyme, sens there be no mo here

               PLA.
               Thou
remembrest, that it is agreed by vs
bothe, that neyther the knowynge

of good catell from bad / or howe to
plante well and to make a fayre orchard / 
ne the deuisinge of fayre houses,
and buyldinges / nor the increasinge
of goodes or possessions, or the
optayninge of great offices or dignities,
or the sharpe witte and quickenes
in raisoninge: is that knowlege / 
wherin is wisedome? What sayest
thou to other sciences or craftes,
whiche are not rehersed?
            
            
               ARI.
               I
suppose the same of them al generally.
For of eueriche of them I haue
knowen some men to be littell better
than naturall fooles / and out of the
feate / whiche they dayly exercised,
vneth perceyuinge that / whiche we
call commune rayson.
            
            
               PLA.
               Ye, &
that wars is / liuynge bestly and out
of all order, whiche is the greattest
& moste euident token of ignoraunce,
whiche is contrarie and ennemie to
knowledge. But nowe Aristippus,
for as moche as longe disputation

prouoketh tediousenes, me semeth / 
if we broughte in some varietie or
chaunge in the order of our communication,
it shulde refresshe both our
wittes.
            
            
               ARISTIP.
               What menest
thou therby? Take hede that we
runne not out of our matter.
            
            
               PLA.
               No, doubt thou not therof, I shall
prouide well ynough therfore. But
herke I wyll tell the nowe / what I
mene. We haue hetherto spoken of
knowlege, wherin is Sapience: but
what or wherin hit is, we yet perceiue
not, but be nowe in sekynge.
               What, and if we now vsed the way
of a cunnynge paynter, whiche in
makynge an ymage of a very fayre
woman naked / to the intent that he
wyll sette out the fygure perfaictly / 
& (as I mought speke like a warkeman)
by prospectiue: that it maye
seme to the beholders therof moste
liuely / & therfore the bodi and membres
shuld shewe to them as rounde

and fulle, as it were imbosed and
wrought in tymber, metall, or stone?
he makith the grounde of his warke
of the depest blacke coloure that he
may come by, which the more intentifly
that a man doeth behold it / the
more liueli or quicke shal the fresshly
colour of the image apere to the eye / 
& the proportion seme more rounde,
and in the forme of a body lyuinge.
In semblable wise I intendynge to
sette oute a parfeict figure of knowlege,
if I treate fyrst of Ignoraunce / 
and makynge that to be well perceiued / 
I suppose it shall not be inconueniente:
but the true proportion
of knowlege afterwarde, whanne I
shall go aboute to declare it / shall be
more apparaunt and easy to be vnderstande / 
and the varietie in our cō
                  munication
shall make the matter
more pleasant.
            
            
               ARI.
               In good faith
Plato thy deuise liketh me wonderfull
well. Wherfore saye on a goddes

name.
            
            
               PL.
               Is Ignorance any other
thing Aris. than lacke of knowlege?
            
            
               ARI.
               No surely.
            
            
               PL.
               Thā nothing
is so cōtrari to knowlege as ignorance.
            
            
               ARI.
               Nothing.
            
            
               PL.
               Is a
brute beest inferior to mākind by any
thing so moch as by ignorance? For
in bodily strength, long life / agilitie &
swiftnes, ther be diuers bestes which
fer do excede him / onely by ignorance
they be all inferiors vnto him.
            
            
               A.
               Thou were wont also to say, that
bestes lacked the soule that mā hath
which is īmortal.
            
            
               PL.
               That is true.
But thou must remēbre, that the soule
with the body maketh the mā. For
if the body lacked a soule, though it
hadde life, yet were it no man but a
beest. And that the figure makith not
a mā / it aperith by those bestes, which
be callid satiri / fauni / hipocētauri / 
& diuers other / which be founden in
Affrike hauing som the visage / some
the hole figure of mans bodi. And in

the same soule, whiche maketh the
man, and without it man is not, nor
may be, hathe nothinge lasse in him
than ignoraunce, and if a man seme
to be ignoraunt, it hapneth neuer a
whitte of the soule, but of the grosnes
of the body, whiche is bestiall,
as of the same matter and substance
that brute beastes be of: which will
not lette the soule, that is of a diuine
substance, to shewe the effectes and
disposition of her nature, whiche is
onely knowledge: the lacke wherof
being caused by the obiect or lette of
the bodi, is nothing but ignoraunce.
Lykewise as a thicke & great cloude
coueringe the sonne / wyll not lette
hym to sende furthe his beames on
the erthe, wherby the erthe lacketh
lyght / and that lacke is called derkenesse.
Nowe laye aparte all artes
& sciences, which (as thou knowest
wel inough) were founden by mannes
Inuention and experience, long

after that man was created: and set
man in the same astate that he was
in before the sayd artes and sciences
were inuented: yet were he than a
man as he is nowe, And lacketh not
any thynge, wherby he is named a
a man. Wherin nowe doth appere
the diuersitie bytwene hym and a
brute beaste? Tell me nowe as thou
thinkest?
            
            
               ARI.
               What els but in the
same thinge / for the whiche beastes
be surnamed brute.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou
sayest truth: but yet leste I be deceyuid
by the diuersitie of oure two vnderstandynges:
I pray the tell me in
fewe wordes, what by the sayde
worde, brute, is signified.
            
            
               ARI.
               Mary agreed: I take that signifieth
grose, insensate / lackynge capacitie
of knowlege / finally it amounreth to
as moche as ignoraunt.
            
            
               PLA.
               By
the faythe of my body thou haste
made an exposition very compendiouse
and elegant. Than be we both

agreed, that ignorance makith the diuersite
betwene a beast & a man. But
what Ignorance I pray the? Ignorance
in building of houses, makyng
of cloth, or warking of metall, or ꝑaduenture
ignorance in grāmer, or logike,
or making or versis / or els playeng
on the shalmes or the lute? Doth
ignorance in any of these cause the diuersite?
            
            
               AR.
               It semeth nay. For thou
diddest presuppose, that a man were
in the same astate, that all men were
in / or euer any artes or sciences were
founden / & than of that thing that is
not / it were foly to suppose any ignoraunce.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou speakest not
moche a mysse. But yet for an other
cause / Ignoraunce in any of the sayd
artes or sciences doeth not make the
diuersitie that we nowe speake of.
               For if it shuld so do / thā who so euer
lacked any of the said artes or sciences:
it shuld folowe that he were ignoraunt,
& therfore he were no man

but a beaste. And also bees, silkewormes,
and spydars shuld not cō
                  pare
with vs onely, but shulde seme
also to excede vs in knowlege. For
as moche as without any instructor
or teacher, they at the fyrst without
losse of any thing / can perfectli make
waxe / hony, silke and copwebbes:
whiche no man can do like, nor by
none inuention canne attayne to the
knowlege, how it ought to be done.
And as for the bee and the spynner,
who so euer studiously do beholde
their warke / he shall se therin suche
order / that beside the office of nature
he shal wōder at the equalite or iustnes
of proportion / so exactly obserued / 
that none artificer can amende
it. But now Aristip. sens this is not
the Ignoraunce / that any of vs both
haue mente hytherto / I praye the
what Ignoraunce supposest thou it
is, that makith this diuersite?
            
            
               ARI.
               I suppose hit be this, that a beaste

hath not the knowlege of hym selfe
and of other, in the diuersite of their
kindes. For my horse knoweth not
that he is a horse / no more he doeth
that he is a beast and I a man: neyther
the bee / at whose industry thou
haste so moche wondred, whanne
the hiue is broken: he knoweth not
whether it be a man or a beaste that
taketh his hony combes, & putteth
hym out of his lodgyng, wheron he
hath bestowed so moche labour.
               Nor the spainell that is so ialouse ouer
his miaster, hath not the knowlege
whether his maister be a man
or elles a beaste as he is. Contrary
wyse, a manne knoweth that he is a
man, and knoweth also euery other
beaste in his kynde.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou
cōmest nigh to the point Aristippus.
But beware that thou be not deceiued,
if after Pythagoras doctrine / 
whan men be deade theyr soules entre
in to horsis / lyons / and swine.
               
                  
And after many yeres trauaylynge
they retourne agayne to be men:
               Than there mought be in thy horse
the soule of kynge Sardanapalus / 
wherby thy horse moughte knowe
what thou art and hym selfe to.
            
            
               ARI.
               Thou aduauncest me highly
Plato / whan thou supposest me to
ryde on a kynge, and on so greatte a
king as Sardanapalus was / which
reigned ouer Assyria and Babylon.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou art worthy to haue no
worse horse Aristippus, sens by thy
profession thou art demed prelate of
all voluptie or wanton appetites:
vnto whome moche greater princis
than Sardanapalus was / haue ben
knowen to be seruantes.
            
            
               ARI.
               Mo
peraduenture than of thy sower &
vnpleasant vertues wolde gladly be
folowers.
            
            
               PLA.
               But nowe that I
remembre me, thou nedest not to be
aferd Aristippus, for thou art neuer
the more deceyued. In good feythe

thy horse hathe yet no more knowlege
than a very horse hath in dede.
            
            
               ARI.
               What meanest thou therby?
            
            
               PLA.
               For whan Sardanapalus liued,
and was kynge of Assyria / he
than knewe not hym selfe. For abandonynge
not onely the maiestie
of a kyng / but also the office of a mā,
he lefte the company of men / and sat
continually with his concubynes atyred
in the forme of a woman / spinnynge
in the rocke / and cared for nothynge,
but howe he mought excell
all his wenches in wātonnes. Now
sens he than beinge in the forme of a
man / so moch forgat what he was,
thinkest thou that there be in hym
lasse ignorance now that he is in the
fourme of a horse?
            
            
               ARI.
               Nay in
good fayth, but moche more. And
because thou sayest so Plato / I haue
euen the fondest horse that euer man
rode on. For whan he was yonge,
he was so mare wode / that no man

mought ride him. And now that he
is old, & that I pitieng him do vse to
ride on him some smal iournaies: by
my trouth whan we be in the brode
highway, if he se. iiii. miles of, a rase
of mares / he wil in spite of my tethe
leue the way & go to thē whan he is
not able to ren, nor bridell nor sporre
may hold him. And yet whā he cō
                  meth
thider / sauing onely neyenge &
kicking / he can do nothing. And therfor
it may wel be (if Pythagoras do
trine be true) that the soule of Sardanapalꝰ
is in sorel my horse. But if
I knew it for certain / bi god I wold
haue the fairest mares that ani wher
mought be gottē for him.
            
            
               P.
               Now
on mi faith that is merily spokē. But
in dede Arist. the said sentēce of Pythagoras
ought not to be taken as it
is writtē without ani other expositiō
nomore thā his mistical coūsailes called
Simbola. As / cut not the fire with
a sword / Lepe not ouer the balance,

Taste nothinge which hath a blacke
tayle, and suche other lyke, whiche
thou hast often tymes herde of: but
there in is a more secrete meanynge / 
& approchinge nere vnto rayson. As
in myne opinion / by the translation
of mans soule, wherof we haue spoken,
from a man to a beast, and finally
estsones vnto a man agayne: It
may be wel vnderstand in this wise.
That men beinge in the state of Innocency
haue than the figure of mā,
the soule hauinge the hole preeminence
ouer the body. But after if
                     •
                   it
happen that the appetites and desyres
of the body so moch do increase,
that they haue the hole possession
of the body / and that the affections
of the soule, that is to saye / vertues
be suppressed or putte to silence / than
the lyfe becommeth beastely: than
loke in what beastes the sayde appetites
be mooste vehemente: he / in
whome is the semblable appetite,

may be sayd hathe his soule in that
best inclosed. As he that is lecherous
and wanton, in such a horse as thou
spakest of while ere. A cruel man or
Tyraunt in to a tigre or lion, a glotton
or drunkarde in to a wolfe or a
swyne, and so furthe of other. And
if one man happen to be possessed of
many vices / than is his trāsformatiō
more dyuers / and as I mought saye
more monstruouse. Also beinge in
that beastly astate, & the soule with
her affectes beinge hyd and not shewyng
her puissance, what any other
thynge is more in them thanne ignorance?
Which beinge a thing beastly,
is as propre to them as beastly
appetite. But if god so willinge after
longe trauailing in yll affections,
the soule recouereth her myght / and
vanquisht ignoraunce / makynge the
body to knowe his misery, than the
beastes hyde by littell and littell falleth
a way as knowlege increaseth,

and finally man resumeth his very
figure and proportion lyuinge after
the rule of the soule, and so continueth
perpetually. Howe sayest thou
Aristippus to this exposition?
            
            
               ARI.
               It semeth to me to stand with good
rayson: for euer me thought that
Pythagoras sentence, whiche was
a man of incomparable wisedome / 
had suche a meaninge.
            
            
               PLA.
               Also
it appereth by the sayde sentence / 
that Ignorance maketh a mā beastly,
& that knowlege putteth awaye
beastlynes, and restoreth a man to
his dignitie.
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye verely.
            
            
               PL.
               And it semeth by that, which is rehersed
that Ignorance that we calle
beastly, is in that, that bestes do not
know what thei thē selfes be / nor betwene
them and men what is the diuersitie.
Also that men knowe the
diuersitie betwene them and brute
beastes / it hapneth of the soule, hauyng
preeminence ouer the bodye / 

that is to saye while the soule doeth
holde the sences of the body vnder
due rule & obedience.
            
            
               ARI.
               I wote
not, howe to answere the. For I
haue affirmed so moche before, that
I can not replie nowe with myne honestie.
            
            
               PLA.
               For they kepynge of
touche Aristippus I can well prayse
the. But howe sayest thou? Haue
we not of ignorance spoken for this
tyme sufficiently?
            
            
               AR.
               Yes I suppose / 
and we haue nowe passed two
myles in oure iournay: therfore retourne
where thou leftest to speke of
knowledge. For thou haste layde a
good grounde on thy table to set out
thyne ymage.
            
            
               PLA.
               I se thou forgettest
nothyng that I haue spoken.
Therfore lette vs assaye to expresse
that Image, that is to saye, declare
what is that knowlege, wherin lieth
very wisedom, which peraduenture
kinge Dionise hoped to finde in me / 
whan he first desired to se me.
            
         
         
            
            THE SECOND
DIALOGVE.
            
               PLA.
               THou dost remembre Aristippus,
that we be agreed,
that knowlege is
contrary to Ignorance?
And I suppose also they
be so contrarie / that they may neuer
accorde / or in any part be mingled together:
but alway where the one is,
the other lacketh.
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye surely
it must nedes folowe.
            
            
               PLA.
               Than
whan Ignorance is ones put away
clerely / knowlege onely remayneth.
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye so I trowe: or els I wote
not what it is, that abideth / excepte
I wolde calle it nothynge. And yet
nowe I am aduised, that same, nothynge / 

is Ignoraunce. For of nothinge
can be no knowlege.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou speakest truely / and as it besemeth
the scoler of Socrates. Now
thou knowest that Ignorāce is of bestes / 
which therfore be named brute:
& that knowlege is only pertaininge
to man. And that the Ignoraunce / 
wherby beastes be most vnlike vnto
man, is Ignoraunce of them selfes,
in as moche as they knowe not / that
they be beastes. Than it foloweth,
that the knowlege, whiche maketh
the greattest diuersitie betwene man
& beast / and wherby man hath preeminence
in dignitie ouer beastes / is
the knowlege of hym selfe: wherby
also he knoweth other.
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye,
supposest thou so? Doeth a man by
knowynge hym selfe knowe other
also?
            
            
               PLA.
               No doubt therof, and
that shalt thou se prouid in the order
of our cōmunication / by the same raison
that shal make him to know him

selfe. But yet lefte thou be deceiued,
I wyll by the waye demaunde one
question of the. Thou saydest while
ere Aristippus, that a beast hath not
the knowlege of hym selfe and of other
in the diuersitie of theyr kindes,
I praye the what vnderstodest thou
therby? Any other than thou dyddest
declare by the exāple of the bee
and the spaynell?
            
            
               ARI.
               None other:
Why, thinkest thou Plato / 
that I sayd not well?
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou
camest (as I said) nigh to the point,
but yet thou hittest it not. For peraduenture
thy supposell may be in
some part false, although thou hast
not c
                     •
                  pied it. Dost thou not behold,
that beastes, whiche be sauage, as
they be diuers in kynde, so do they
couayt to be together, and wil seuer
them selfes from other? And in the
acte of generation wyll accompany
with none other beast, but suche as
is of his owne propre kynde: notwithstanding

that there be diuers of
thē one so like an other: that vneth a
man can discerne the diuersitie. As
wolfes and mastyfes: foxes and curres,
hares and conyes, and many other
beastes / whiche were tediouse
to be rehersed. And as touchinge
the bee, that we spake of, be there
not diuers flies lyke vnto him? And
for all that he wyll companye with
none of them / nor yet suffer them (if
he be of power to resiste) entre in to
his hyue / but at the fyrst sighte wyll
withstande hym. Moreouer all
the sayd bestes, whan they perceiue
a man commyng toward them / they
wyll not abyde, but flee soner from
hym than from any beast. Moreouer
amonge an infinite nombre of
people, a dogge wyl know his maister / 
although ther were a thousand
men, in personage, fascion, and colour
of garmētes veri like vnto him.
And if thou woldest saye, that the

dogge doeth discerne that by sent of
smellinge. Yet wold I demaunde of
the agayne, howe it hapneth / that a
dogge taken vp at Olinthum, and
brought vnto Athenes / whiche be
distant. xl. myles one place from the
other, and is a very diffuse way to
kepe, and littell trauayled, yet after
that the dogge haue ben retained at
Athenes by the space of syxe monethes / 
whan he hath ben at libertie
he hath retourned agayne home to
his maisters house, howe woldest
thou answere me Aristippus?
            
            
               ARI.
               Howe elles? But euen as thou thy
selfe diddest suppose that I wolde
saye, that the dogge founde the way
by sent specially, addynge to peraduenture
some parte of his syghte.
            
            
               PLA.
               But perchaunce or he come
to Olinthum his maister hathe forsaken
the house that he dwelled in / 
whan he was with hym, and is remoued
in to an other house: doest

thou not thinke, that the dogge wil
go to the house, wher he left his maister,
and not to the house where he
dwelleth?
            
            
               AR.
               Yes in good sayth.
            
            
               PLA.
               And yet percase he shal fynde
his maisters steppes in the strete towarde
his newe house. And notwithstandynge
as sone as he espieth
the other house / he passeth forthe, &
goeth streight to it. But whan he cometh
in, and fyndeth not his maister
there, yet he layeth hym down as he
were at home, trusting that his maister
wyll shortly come in: doeth he
this by sight or by smellinge?
            
            
               ARI.
               Thou makest me doubt Plato, whither
he doeth it by any of them.
            
            
               PLA.
               What if it happen, that his
master not knowing him to be ther / 
standynge nigh to the windowe talketh
loude with his neighbour / so
that the dogge hereth hym: thinkest
thou not / that he wyl ryse sodainly / 
& with great hast come ioifully vntil

his maister?
            
            
               ARI.
               Yes / I haue sene
that in experience.
            
            
               PLA.
               Doth he
that by sauour or by syght?
            
            
               ARI.
               By neyther of them, but onely by
heringe.
            
            
               PLA.
               And whan he cometh
to him / he streight leapeth vppon
hym without any smellynge.
            
            
               ARISTIPPVS.
               I am yet in dout / 
what I may saye.
            
            
               PLATO.
               Onely
by cause thou wylte not graunte
contrarye to thyne assercyon, that
a beaste hathe knowledge of hym
selfe and other in the diuersitie of
theyr kyndes. But whatte wylte
thou saye / if it shall appere vnto the / 
that bestes haue yet an other knowlege
among them selfes thā by their
sences? haste not thou sene, whanne
men haue preparid them selfes to go
on huntyng, and to that intent haue
brought forthe theyr leshes, colers,
and lyams / or elles theyr hayes and
pursenettes, that the houndes espienge
these thynges / haue reioyced

and lept about the house / as if they
knewe that they shulde go on huntynge?
Likewyse whan they here
the hunter blowe his horne / they
doo all ryse, and with one voyce
doo make a greatte noyse, as if they
consented to goo to that solace.
               And if they herde one blowe in a
shalme or a trumpette / they wolde
not do so.
               ¶The coursar / whiche is vsed to
bataylle / as soone as he herethe the
trumpettes blowen / he snorteth and
brayeth, and takyng to him his courage,
he tredith hygh, & praunceth / 
and with suche bragges declareth
him selfe redy to set furth in bataile,
supposest thou, that these beastes
haue this knowlege onely by the sences,
wherof we haue spoken?
            
            
               ARI.
               No, hir semethe to me nowe, that
they haue an other knowledge than
onely by sences, but what hir is / or
wherof hir procedethe / I canne not

discusse excepte I shulde name it naturall
influence, diuersely disposed
more or lasse, after the grosenesse or
capacitie of the body, whervnto it
sloweth.
            
            
               PLA.
               By the faythe of
my body, and that definition is not
to be dispreised / if thou adde thervnto
the sences. But by this that thou
and I haue nowe spoken / it semeth,
that beastes haue knowlege of them
selfes and other in the diuersitie of
theyr kyndes, contrarie to thy fyrste
diuision. And if it be so, than be they
equal to men / and without cause we
do cal them ignorant or brute.
            
            
               ARI.
               I wote not what to saye to the.
            
            
               PLA.
               Abide Aristippus / dispayre
not / thou haste spoken more wiseliar
than thou art ware of.
            
            
               ARI.
               Trowest
thou so Plato?
            
            
               PLA.
               Ye / and
that shalt thou perceiue if thou wilt
here me.
            
            
               ARI.
               Go to than I praye
the.
            
            
               PLA.
               Lette it not be tediouse
vnto the to haue some thinges repeted,

which thou hast spoken.
               ¶Fyrst if thou remembre thy selfe,
thou woldest not denie, but that
wisedome was knowledge. After
warde thou grauntiddest also, that
Ignoraunce was none other thynge
but lacke of knowlege, whiche concluded,
that Ignoraunce could be no
wisedome. And than dyddest thou
raison / that the diuersitie betwene
man and beast was onely ignorance.
And that Ignoraunce dyddest thou
suppose to be the lacke of knowlege
of them selfes / and other in the diuersitie
of theyr kyndes. This was very
well gathered of the, in myne opinion.
And the raison that folowed
by the example that thou dyddeste
putte of thy horse / the bee / and the
spaynell, was not vnfitte to the purpose,
if thou woldest haue abyden
well by it. But by our mery digression
in to Pythagoras regeneratiōs / 
thou were brought from that argument / 

soner than thou shuldest haue
ben: whiche hapned vnto the / as it
doeth euer to them, whiche lyke vnto
the / do folowe the concupiscence
and pleasaunt affectes of the body.
For lyke as they be vnstable, so the
folowers & louers of them be euer in
constant: as well in their opinions
as in their actes. But if thou being
sometyme the herer of Socrates as
well as I was, haddest folowed directly
his doctrine / accordyng as he
spake it / and also practised it by his
example of lyuyng / and haddest not
as a truant pycked out of his argumentes
suche matter as thou supposiddest
mought only maynteine thy
sensuall appetite / thou shuldest haue
perceyued what thou thy selfe haddest
mente, whiche thou doest not
nowe / it varieth so moche from thy
profession. And peraduenture the
knowledge that we nowe seke for,
shuld neuer haue comen betwene vs

two in question. But it shulde haue
suffised to haue told to the, what I
sayde to kynge Dionise, and howe
he delte with me. And thou shuldest
sone haue iuged / if he had according
to mi merites intreted me. But now
Aristippus to thintent thou mayste
take some comforte of the sedes of
Socrates doctrine / which remayne
in the, but they wyll not springe / in
suche wyse as thou mayste see them / 
except I do water them with my declaration.
¶Fyrst remembre that
of all that whiche bereth the name
of a thynge / there be two kyndes,
one hath no bodye & is euer stedfast
and permanent / the other hath a body,
but it is euer moueable & vncertein,
The first, bicause it may be vnderstāde
only / it is called intelligible.
The second, bicause it may be felt by
sensis it is called Sensible. The way
to know the fyrste is called raison, &
the knowlege therof is namid vnderstāding.

The way to know the. ii. is
called Sense or feling / the knowlege
therof is named Perceiuinge. More
ouer of that which is called Intelligible
there is the fyrst & the seconde.
In the fyrste is that portion of diuinitie,
whiche is in man, wherby he
is made to the image and similitude
of god. In the other be noumbres
and figures. Of this beastes haue
no parte, neyther of the fyrste nor
yet of the seconde: of the fyrst I suppose
thou wylte graunt me, and as
for the seconde experience wyl proue
it? for I dare saye / thou neuer hardest
of beastes / that coude skylle of
nombrynge.
            
            
               ARI.
               I wote nere, I
neuer called any yet to a reckenyng.
            
            
               PLA.
               And though an ape or other
lyke beaste / seme in takynge of thinges
to obserue an ordre, as it were
in nombrynge / yet if it be well considered / 
it shall appere that it is by an
imagination ingendred of custome,

and not by nombrynge. I haue sene
a man, whiche was borne blynde,
and vsed to be ladde to thre or foure
houses in the citie, whiche hath ben
a great distance a sondre, at the laste
by custome hathe knowen so well
where they stode / that without any
man or dogge leadynge, or any man
tellynge hym / he hath gone directly
vnto them. Wherat fyrste I meruayled
with many other, and whan
I communed with hym, I haue perceyued
that he neuer obserued nombre,
but that onely custome had set
the distance of the places in his imagination.
Like may be spoken of figures.
For that wherby beastes do
discerne one thinge from an other / is
not vnderstandynge / that is to saye
though they discerne in quantite the
more from the lasse, yet they vnderstand
it not, as rounde, quadraunt / 
or triangle / or in other lyke fygure:
but the simulacre or ymage / wherby

they pecyue the sayd diuersite / is onely
by custome, formed & imprinted in
the principal sēse, which is the hart.
And whā the thing selfe is remoued
out of sight / that impression that remaineth
is called imagination / who
cōmittith it forthwith vnto memori,
which vndouted is not only in men
but also in bestis, for thei discerne the
tyme present and that which is passed,
but the tyme to com they know
not, & Memory is onely of the time
passed. And therfore the bestes that
thou spakest of / doo perceiue the diuersitie
of thynges by imagination &
Memorie, conceiuynge & reteyninge
in the harte, whiche is the principall
sense or fountain of senses, the image
of the thynge that is sensible. And
therby the dogge perceyuethe his
mayster / & fetcheth his gloue / which
he hath ben before taught for to do / 
& goeth to the places where he hath
sene his maister bene a littell before.

But that he knoweth not whether
his maister be a mā or a horse / Plato
or Demosthenes, a philosopher or
an oratour, it is euidēt inough. For
although my dogge had abyden ten
yeres continually with me, and had
herde me euerye daye speake of Demosthenes / 
& name hym an oratour / 
and herd the call me euery day Plato,
and name me a philosopher: yet
if thou woldest deliuer vnto him anithing,
& byd hym c
                     •
                  ry it to the oratour / 
he wolde strayt brynge it vnto
me, and not to Demosthenes. Also if
I wold cast a lofe vnto my spaynell / 
& bid him cary it to my horse, I suppose
he wold forthwith eate it hymself,
& lye downe whā he hath done / 
without seking for mi horse / though
he stode by him / is it not so?
            
            
               A.
               Ye in
good faith me thinkith thou saist truly.
            
            
               P.
               And likewise mai be raisoned of
al other bestes be thei neuer so wily / 
if their actis be depely considered.
            
            
               A.
               
                  
It appereth so.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thanne thy
sayinge is not to be reproued, that
a beaste lacked knowledge of hymselfe
and of other.
            
            
               ARI.
               No, as it
semethe.
            
            
               PLA.
               And that lacke of
knowledge is ignorance.
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye
truely, and so sayde I also.
            
            
               PLA.
               And that ignorance made the diuersiue
betwene man and beaste.
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye and the same to.
            
            
               PLA.
               Than
thou wylt conclude / that man hath
knowlege?

               Ye that I must nedes
thou knowest well ynough.
            
            
               PL.
               And what callest thou that knowledge?
suppose
                     •
                  t thou it is where a
manne knowethe hym selfe and other?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye so I sayd, and thou
haste also affyrmed it.
            
            
               PLA.
               So I
dydde in dede, but yet good Aristippus / 
suffer me to demaunde of
the a fewe questions / we shall the
sooner fynde out the knowlege that
we seke for. Is it in figure & nombre
that knowlege resteth?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye so

it appereth.
            
            
               PLA.
               Nay, if thou remembre
the. Perdie thou saydest
thy selfe, that thy horse knewe not,
that thou were a manne, or that he
was a horse.
            
            
               ARI.
               So sayde I indede.
            
            
               PL.
               Thou cōsiderest also, that
it was agreed by vs bothe, that the
figure made not the man, but it was
the soule with the body / that caused
the manne to be so named: and that
without the soule, not withstādyng
the figure of man, yet were he no mā
but a brute beaste.
            
            
               ARI.
               It muste
nedes be so, I can not deny it.
            
            
               PLA.
               Than is there somewhat more that
makethe the sayde knowlege besydes
the fygure / whiche is conteyned
in the seconde part of that / whiche
we called Intelligible?
            
            
               ARI.
               So
me thinketh. But what hit is I can
not remembre.
            
            
               PLA.
               It is no meruayle,
thy wy
                     •
                  tes be so inuolued in
carnal affections, that this clene and
pure doctrine canne not entre in to

them without gret difficultie, & whā
they be ones in, they can not longe
abide / thy memorie is so occupied
about wanton and beastly fantasy.
But yet wyl I ones agayne reherce
vnto the that, whiche thou haste so
shortly forgotten. Dyd not I saye,
that in the fyrste part of that, which
is named Intelligible / is that portion
of diuinitie in man, wherby he is
made to the ymage and similitude
of god?
            
            
               ARI.
               Yes I remembre
well that.
            
            
               PLA.
               And is that forme
printed in any other thynge than in
mans soule, whiche is immutable
and of one proportion and fygure?
               All though it lyeth bounden in the
body / as it were in a prison / consideringe
thynges diuersely: as the substance
and qualities of the body suffreth
hym to take light: beinge deceyued
by the iudgement of the sences
or wittes, estemynge thynges as
they be sēsible & visible: where that / 

whiche the soule by hym selfe doeth
consyder, is intelligible and also inuisible.
            
            
               ARI.
               I doubt me what I
shall say. But supposest thou Plato,
that the ymage and similitude of
god is not in the body of mā as well
as in the soule?
            
            
               PLA.
               Hast thou so
sone forgotten that, whiche I haue
so often rehersed? That if the body
of mā were without a soule, he were
than but in the nombre of brute beastes,
which haue sēces as wel as he / 
and some more sharp & quicker. And
no man that wil affirme that god is / 
wyll presume (as I trowe) to saye
expressely that the ymage of god is
in Satires / and other beastes and
fysshes / whiche haue fourme and
shappe lyke vnto manne. And to
speke to the meryly without reproche
vnto goddes maiestie, If that
whiche is in euery mannes bodye / 
were the ymage of godde, Certes
thanne the ymage of godde were

not onely diuers, but also horrible / 
monstruouse, and in some part ridiculouse:
that is to say, to be laughed
at. For euery man hathe not in visage
and personage, one proportion
or figure. Some haue a playne and
equall visage, some loke as they
laughed / other as they wept / diuers
as they were euer angri, many haue
in the quantitie of theyr bodies or
membres excesse or lacke. Wherfore
to thynke that all these be lyke vnto
god (whiche as he is the creatoure
of them all / and maye make and do
what he lysteth, so it agreeth with
all raison
                     •
                   that he incomparably excelleth
them all in euery perfection
and consequently in beautie) it were
of all other the greatest madnesse.
            
            
               ARI.
               Thou aunswerest me raysonably / 
but nowe I pray the declare
to me as plainly, howe the ymage
of god is in the soule / as thou supposest.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou wilt not deny, that

god is without any body / inuisible
and immortal, whose forme can not
be deprehended with the eyen of
mortal mē / nor described by any sensible
knowlege?
            
            
               ARI.
               No truely.
            
            
               PLA.
               And the same I trowe thou
wilt confesse of the soule?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye
verily.
            
            
               PLA.
               Also god is in power
in all and euery parte of the world:
And by his prouidence all thynge is
gouerned and moued. And he him
selfe is of none other moued nor gouerned / 
but is the fyrste incomprehensible
mouer.
            
            
               ARI.
               I can by no
raison denye it / except I wold deny,
that god is / & that I maye not / sens
that the order of al thing that is visible / 
declareth that there must nedes
be one principall cause and beginnynge,
which we call god. And
also that order can not be withoute
prouidence and one perpetuall gouernance.
            
            
               PL.
               Yet thou sayest wel,
and as it besemeth Socrates scoler.

But nowe Aristippus, for as moche
as god is the fyrst & principall cause.
And as he is one in begynnynge / so
is he euer one in gouernaunce: And
therfore hauinge in hym al sufficiency
and powar, wilt thou not graunt
me, that he is of an absolute and full
perfection?
            
            
               ARI.
               Yes that must I
nedes.
            
            
               PLA.
               And is not perfection / 
in that it is perfect / good also?
            
            
               ARI.
               No man wyl deny it.
            
            
               PLA.
               Ye per
aduenture the same perfection is
goodnesse / sens goodnesse is alwaye
complete, profitable, and withoute
any lacke. And goodnesse and euyll
the one is contrarie and euer repugnant
vnto the other: Howe sayest
thou? is it not so?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye that
is true.
            
            
               P.
               Thā is there euer variāce
betwene them?
            
            
               ARI.
               So it appereth.
            
            
               PLA.
               But in god can neuer
be variance, whiche of his nature is
euer one, & may neuer suffer diuision.
            
            
               ARI.
               I graunt the.
            
            
               PLA.
               Than in

god nor about god can be none euil:
therfore all euyll is ferre from god.
               But yet me semeth we haue spoken
somwhat lasse of god than we shuld
do.
            
            
               ARI.
               What meanest thou therby?
            
            
               PLA.
               For sens we bothe haue
agreed, that he is the fyrste begynnynge
and cause: we shuld haue also
concluded / that all goodnesse proceded
of hym / and that he was the
fountayne and principall goodnesse.
            
            
               AR.
               I admit al to be true that thou
sayest.
            
            
               PLA.
               Than thou grauntest,
that cuyll is contrarie to god?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye verily.
            
            
               PLA.
               And all thynge

whiche is good?

               Ye surely.

               Those thinges that be contrarie

               Than it semeth / that
they be vnlyke?
            
            
               A.
               So it appereth.
            
            
               PL.
               That / wherin thinges be like or
vnlyke one to an nother, do we not

calle it an ymage or similitude?
            
            
               AR.
               Yes vndoubtedly.
            
            
               PLA.
               Hytherto
we haue well agreed. Nowe let
see Aristippus, Sens thou haste confessed / 
that the soule is inuisible and
immortalle howe sayest thou? shall
it suffise that therin onely he be like
vnto god and in all other thynge vnlyke
or contrarye?
            
            
               ARI.
               No: for
than shulde he be in parte lyke / and
in parte vnlyke: And than were hit
not welle spoken to saye / that man
was made to the ymage and similitude
of god / without ioynyng therto
distinctly & particularly in what
thynge he was made to the sayd ymage
& similitude: As if one wolde
saye / that in thy sonne / were thy
ꝓpre image and similitude. If thou
thy selfe dyddest perceyue that he
were lyke to the in fauour, proportion
of bodye and condicions, thou
woldest holde the pleased and saye
nothynge. But if thou beheldeste / 

that in his personage he were lyke
the / but in some parte of the visage
as in the nose, the eyen, or the mouthe
he were vnlyke the, Also in liberalitie
he folowed the, but in lechery
he did degenerate from the: shuldest
thou not than be constrayned to demaunde
of hym that spake, wherin
thy sonne is lyke to the / or in what
parte of hym thyne ymage shulde
appere to be moste?
            
            
               PLA.
               Nowe
on my fayth Aristippus thou speakest
very well and wysely. Lo, see,
howe by oure longe cōmuning thou
art drawen from thy wanton affections
and fantasyes / whereby the
sparkis of wysedome, that thou
gatist of Socrates lessons / lyke as
fyre hydde vnder askes and deed
cooles, whan they be remoued is
found sindrynge in lytel imbres: so
thyn affections beinge withdrawen
wysedom doth begyn to glyter and
shew / whiche if it wold abide kend

lynge, & not like vnto imbres remoue
& fle awai with eueri puffe of wīde,
I doubte not but for the sharpnes of
thy wit, of al Socrates scolers thou
should
                     •
                  st be at the last one of the most
wisest and excellēt. But I wil speke
therof no more / lest thou shuldist suppose
I did to the that I wolde not
do to kīg Dionise, I mene flater the.

                  No no, I peciue wherabout thou
goest: thou woldist with psuasion,
wherin I knowe thou art meruaylous,
withdraw me if thou moughtist
frō my, pfessed opiniō / but that is
now no part of our mater.
            
            
               P.
               Yet I
suppose thou art deceyued
                     •
                   for thou
shalt finde it otherwise, or we be at
an ende of our communication: but
where left we? Thou didest affirme
(as I remēbre) that for as moch as
man was made to the image & similitude
of god / he ought to be like vnto
god / not in part / but in all vniuersally.
            
            
               A.
               In al suche lykenes as that

which is creatid mai be most like vnto
his creatour, without cōparison
of equalitie. For god that is alway
one may suffre no pere / or lyke in equalitie
of substāce.
            
            
               P.
               That is verily
wel said Arist. Al though that was
euer ment in our raisoning: for I neuer
supposid, that thou haddist so litell
lerning / to thinke that god made
men equal vnto hym / or so ignorant
that thou knewest not, what an ymage
or similitude is, in respecte of
that where vnto it is wrought. By
that whiche we before haue affirmed,
that god is the first cause & prī
                  cipal
goodnes / it arguith that al thīg
which is not the self god / is inferior
vnto him. Wherfore the image or similitude
of god / al though it be an imitatiō
or folowing in liknes of that
whervnto it is made & resembled / 
yet is it inferior to god: who by the
vertue of his vnitie hath euer a preeminence,
and souerayntie. Therfore
we wyll stycke no more thervppon,

but now I wil assay to declare / how
we may vnderstand, that the similitude
of god is imprinted in manne:
wherin the knowlege that we begā
to treate of / perchaunce shall appere
vnto vs. Wherfore Aristip. I praye
the as thou hast done hitherto
                     •
                   here
me patiently, and whan I shall demande
of the any question, answere
me simply without cauillatiō.
            
            
               ARI.
               Contēted. But be short than I pray
the
                     •
                   for me thinketh hit longe or we
come to an ende of our matter.
            
            
               PL.
               Ye so I suppose. For as I sayd, the
littell sparkes of wisedome that appered
in the, wyll neuer be brought
to be a good fire / they be so mengled
with askes of affectiō: wherby they
be made so incōstant, that they will
not abide the end of my raisō / wher
by perchāce they mought be caused
to kendel and waxe more. But sens
thou hast promysed to here me patiently / 
I wyl go forth with this matter:

and d
                     •
                  ubte not but that I wyll
make an ende / or we come to the cite.
            
            
               ARI.
               Go to than. For I am nowe
prepared to here the.

               SEns we haue treted som
what of god / & of mans
soule (but not sufficientli / 
for that wold require
a moche lengar tyme, &
also that bothe thou and I had our
myndes more cleane pourged with
prayer and pure sacrifice) Nowe
lette vs see as moche as we maye be
suffred / what it is / wherin they most
do resemble.
               ☞ Fyrste all that is in god is perpetualle

none occasyon or for any cause may
be appayred, mynysshed, or corrupted.
That whiche is in the
soule, parte is perpetualle and immutable / 
parte is not perpetualle,
and is also mutable. For that the
soule is Immortalle and inuisible,
that is perpetualle and maye neuer
be chaunged. But vnderstandynge / 
whiche I dydde putte to:
the knowledge of that, whiche
was Intelligible, and named hit a
portion of dyuinitie, is not perpetualle
in the soule, as hit is in
godde, nor all wayes immutable:
but durynge the tyme that hit is
conserued by contemplacy on of the
diuine maiestie, hit is perfecte and
makethe mannes soule lyke vnto
god. And whanne hit is ioyned
vnto corporaile affectes / hit is
made thanne vnperfecte / and the
fourme of the soule, is in a parte

                     •
                  ecayed frome the ryghte symilytude

of god. But if the soule beinge
dedycate to vices / be ones fallen
frome the possession of rayson / 
thanne vnderstandynge is vanysshed
awaye / and the soule remaynethe
with the bodye transfourmed,
as we spake of before.
               And thanne that Immortalytie,
whiche beynge ioyned to vnderstandynge,
made the soule lyke vnto
god / beinge nowe seperate from
hit, shall be to the soule confusion
and tourmente.
               ¶The maiestie of god, in beholding
wherof the sayd vnderstandyng or
knowlege is conserued and kept in
perfection / is all his goodnes / wherof
I haue spoken / and his prouydence,
whiche procedethe of the
same goodnesse. In beholdynge
the goodnesse of Godde / manne
dothe perceyue, that thereof procedethe
vertue. In consyderynge
his prouydence, he fyndethe that

nothynge is made without cause / or
(as I moughte saye) at a venture:
but that all thynges be made for a
pourpose, profitable, and also necessary / 
and so to the respecte therof al
thynges be good.
               ¶Nowe I wyll demaunde of the
Aristippus one question. Doest thou
not remembre / that thou thy selfe
saydest late / that hit were not welle
spoken / to saye that man was made
to the image and similitude of god:
if he had in him no mo thynges lyke
vnto god, but only that he were inuisible
and immortal? and that dyddest
thou ratifie with a good and familiar
exaumple.
            
            
               ARI.
               It is not soo
longe passed sens I spake it 
                     •
                   but that
I may well remembre it.
            
            
               PL.
               And
thou dydst not deni / but that the pte
Intelligible of man is a diuine substance,
wherein is vnderstandynge?
            
            
               ARI.
               No, nor yet wyll I.
            
            
               PLAT.
               Than it semeth / that in vnderstandynge

manne is lyke vnto god. And
the same vnderstandynge is knowledge:
but is man lyke to god in any
other knowlege trowest thou, than
in contemplacyon of the Dyuyne
maiestie?
            
            
               ARIST.

               By my trouthe thou arte

               By that same knowledge also

               By the same rayson

And in that appereth in the a
token of more wisedome: thanne is

               But nowe remembre welle what
thou haste spoken: And shewe me
if thou thinkest that any other creature
hath so moche vse of all thynges

reuolue them well in thy mynde or

commoditie one thynge maye haue

               Me semeth Plato

Other thinges do vse somtime

               Why sayst thou so, sens this is but
comune raison, and (except I be deceyued)
to euerye manne easye? but
that the sayde thynges be to manne
beste and moste profytable / it hapneth

               More ouer the preeminence

A fatte shepe hauynge moche wolle

               ARI.
               Dyddest thou nat mene,
that some beastes were ordayned
for man to eate, some to cladde him
with, some to tyl his lande for corn / 
other to ryde on: lykewyse herbes
and frutes, somme serue for
meate and nourisshynge, diuers for
medicine, stone and tymber to buyld
with. And whiles they be vsed in
this wise as they be ordained / there
alway is order. But if they be vsed
for any other purpose, or one in the
place of an other, there is disorder.

               Abide Aristippus, thou hast

Perdie there be some bestes / foules / 
and fisshes / which wyl serue to none
of the purposes, which thou hast rehersed:

As serpentes / scorpions / 
and suche other lyke: of byrdes the
Egle / the dunkyte, the Ospraye,
and the Cormorant, whiche do rauyn
and deuour that, which is necessary
for mans lyuynge. Also crowes
and rookes may be brought into the
same company: And of fysshes that
which in latine is called torpedo, or
euer he commeth oute of the water
mortifieth the handes of the fysiher
whiles he is drawyng vp of his net.
An other fysshe called Remora / all

other bothe fysshes and byrdes there

I wyll helpe the forthe / as well as

               That is trouth.

               Than spake I

               So it hath bene affirmed by Democritus,

And I my self haue sene meruailes,

               And for as moche as
goodnesse came of them / thou dyddest

iudge all suche thynges to be

               Ye in good faythe.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou diddest therin iuge truly /

knewist any man to be stungen with
a serpente / or Scorpion / whereby
the man perished, diddest thou suppose
thā, that the Scorpion or serpēt
was yl, or good styl as he was whā
he seruyd for a medicine / and preserued
man from the dethe?

               I suppose thou arte not:
But sens we haue affyrmed al thing
to be good in his creation / hauynge
respect to the ende wherfore it was
created. For as moche as the sayde
beastes / byrdes / and fyshes receyued
in theyr creation the disposicions
before touched, whiche thou
supposest to be ylle, by cause therby
manne maye peryshe and dye. Let
vs consyder the cause fynall, wherefore

those dispositions were put by
God of nature into the sayd creatures,
wherin I wyll as briefely as I
can declare to the myne opinion or
sentence. Foresene alway that thou
remembre, that the prouidence of
god is aboue mans capacitie to comprehende
holly: But I doubte nat,
some part of it shal serue (as I said)
to the sufficiente declaration of that
thynge that we pourpose.

               No, for it appereth to me
sufficientely, that it is man: as thou

remēbre, that I sayd, that the diuine
portion, durynge the tyme that it is
cōserued by contemplation of the diuine

               Ye I remembre it
wel.
            
            
               P.
               Now here me out paciētly,

and we shall come shortly to an ende
of this matter. Thou knowest well
ynough Aristippus, that the bodye,
and consequently the sences or wyt
                  
                     •
                  es
that do perteyne thervnto, is the
habitation or vessell, whiche receyueth
the soule. Also affectes or affections
al though while ere I named
them corporal, yet in very dede they
be first in the soule, as intencions be
in the warke manne before he doeth
warke: And whan the soule doeth
exercyse theym / hauynge his chiefe
respect to vnderstandynge / wherof
we haue so moche spoken: than be
they vertues. But if they beinge
mixt with the sences, be all ruled by
them in hauynge onely respecte to
the bodye, than be they vices, and
the soule by the excludyng of vnderstandynge
beinge made subiect vnto
the bodye, they maye than be well
called corporall: as that ought to be
called the goodes of the vaynquysshour,

whiche were the prisoners
before he was taken: or the goodes
of the bondmā be called the lordes.
Nowe so it is that god, of whose
maiestie we haue spoken, and be yet
in speakynge, whan he hathe putte
the soule (accompanyed with affectes
as hir perpetuall seruauntes and
ministres) into the body / as into hir
propre habitation, he gyueth to hir
the sences, to be as hir slaucs or
drudges. And commyttynge to hir
for a chiefe counsayllour vnderstandynge / 
he leaueth with her also,
Free wyll to be hir Secretarye.
               Nowe if she mought alwaye kepe
hir habitation and company in that
astate, as they were lefte vnto hir:
than shuld men be as goddis. And
those thynges whiche brought any
anoyance to men, shulde alwaye be
yll, and be made by nature in vayn.
And also god shulde seme to do ylle
in the ordeynynge of them. Or els

that in thinges there were no prouidence.
But sens of so many men as
nowe be, haue bene / and shall be in

of theyr sences or wyttes: As
some to actes veneriall and highnes
of courage, other more to get possessions
and rychesse / dyuers for euery
lyttell displeasure to be cruelly reuenged.
Many to employe all theyr
studye and labour in yl craft and deceyte:

onely (as the blocke whiche
Iupiter dydde sende downe into the
water to haue rule ouer the paddockes)
to lyestyll and do nothyng.
As soone as any of the sayde inclynations

be conceyued in the sences / 
the mynde begynneth to haue dilectation
therin / and offreth it to vs, as
it were good pleasant & profitable:
than if our affectes / by whom we be
meued to do any thynge, do consent
to the said dilectation, and than immediately
wyll is corrupted / so that
she as false and disloyall, wryteth in
the harte of man (whiche is the soules
booke, wherein all thoughtes be
wrytten) that she sayd Inclination
meued and sette forthe by the sayde
affectes, is profitable and good. If
the soule hastily without asking coū
                  saylle
of vnderstandyng, do approue
the said ꝑswasiō, bileuing wyl, without
any other inuestigatiō or serch:
Thā she being abandoned of vnderstādīg,
loseth hir dignite, & becōmith
ministre vnto the sences / which before
were her slaues / who vsurping
the preeminēce, & hauing the affectis
& Wylle holly at their cōmandment

do possede the body as theyr propre
mancion, leauynge nothynge to the
soule, but to vse onely her powers
after theyr sensuall appetites. And
so Man bireft of that portion / wher
in he was lyke vnto god, is become
equalle or rather inferior to brute
beastes, for suche causes as I before
haue rehersed. Nowe Aristippus,
whan Man is ones broughte vnto
this astate / doest not thou suppose,
that he forgetteth nowe or knoweth
not what he is? or to expresse more
playnly to the what I meane / Is he
not ignorant / that he is transformed
from a man to a beaste? And supposeth
styl that he is like vnto god, and
in the order that we spake of, superiour
vnto al other creatures and do

                  ator ouer them al?
            
            
               AR.
               Ye that
is true, he beleueth so veryly.
            
            
               PLA.
               But yet it is not so. For whan vnderstandynge
was excluded by the
soule, and that she was subdued or

maistred by the sences, than the similitude
of god / whiche was in vnderstandynge / 
vanysshed from hym.
And whan he lefte his owne place
of preeminence / and dydde participate
in carnalle affectes with creatures,
which were to him inferiors,
he brake the lyne of order / and loste
his superioritie: and consequentely
broughte hym selfe and other into
disordre, whiche as we haue agreed
is euylle and contrarye vnto good,
and by the same rayson is ennemye
vnto god / Whiche is onely goodnesse.
For no man wyll denye, but
that thynge / whiche is so contrarye
vnto an other, that in no parte they
may accorde / but be alway repougnaunt:
they be mutually ennemyes
one to an other.
            
            
               ARIST.
               I suppose
it be euen as thou sayst.

               Nowe calle to thy
remembrance
                     •
                   that we were agreed
that al creatures were made for mā,

and that he hadde the moste vse of
them all. Also they all were good
in the order of theyr creation / and
that to man they were best & mooste
profitable as long as they continued
in the sayde order / And beinge in
disorder they were also to manne
warste, and mooste vnprofytable.
               Moreouer all though some beastes,
soules, and fyshes seme to haue in
them a malice, wherby man may be
hurt or anoyed: yet hauing respect
to the cause fynalle / wherfore they
were made / they were / not withstandynge
necessary vnto man specyally.

               I thanke

               I knowe well inoughe
Aristippus, that in matter of great

importaunce / to men that be sensuall,
hauinge their myndes ingrossed
with carnall affections, there is required
a plaine and sensible forme
of raisoning, broken nowe and thau
with often repetitions: whiche all
though to froward herers it semeth
to make the matter tediouse, yet if
they can abide it / they shal therby retain
some sedes of knowlege, like as
in a lande that was neuer well husbonded,
corne wyl growe & springe
in ere / whan men litle loked, for to
haue goten suche frute by theyr ylle
husbondry. But nowe set vp thyn
eares Aristippus / and dyligentlye
here the misterye of the wonderfull
goodnes and prouidēce of god, whiche
shall be declared in the sayde
cause final: whiche I intend now to
expresse & open vnto the without further
delay.
            
            
               ARI.
               Go to now Plato
I haue al my hole mynde setlyd and
prepared to here the, and I shall not

wyllyngly let one worde that passeth
from thy mouthe / eskape me.
            
            
               ¶PLA.
               Thou hast all redy graunted / 
that a counning Artifycer foreseethe
in his ymagination the figure
of the thynge that he warketh, and
to what effect it is wrought, which
is properly called the cause finall.
               And whan it is made / he delyteth in
the beholdyng it. And the more perfect
and excellent that the warke is / 
the more he therin reioycethe, and
prepareth some meane to preserue it
from brekynge or other destruction.
But there is none Artificer to be cō
                  pared
vnto god, eyther in foresyght / 
or in care to preserue that whiche he
hym selfe wrought. Nor there is any
mannes warkemanship lyke to
his in perfection. Wherfore he most
excellently reioicith in his creatures.
And by cause he consyderith / that
Man is the moste wonderfull of all
his warkes, he reioiceth therin most

and incomparably. Also bycause he
made hym to his owne similitude,
he loueth hym / accordynge to the
commune prouerbe: All thynge loueth
that, whiche is mooste lyke to
hym selfe. And therfore he is moste
circumspect in the preseruation therof.
Wherfore considerynge that by
Wylle, perchaunce corrupted, as I
late declared, Man mought declyne
from that perfectiō, wherin he was
made / and by the parte sensible induced
to rebelle agayne his owne
creatoure / thynkynge that of his
owne power he hath all other creatures
vnder his subiection / and that
all that he wylleth is good / not as
vnderstandynge wold instruct him,
but as his affections deceyued by
his sences do falsely perswade hym.
This eternall and incomprehensible
goodnes / whiche we calle GOL,
louinge man as his image incomparably,
hath prouyded to sytte in the

waye, wherby VVYLL shall passe
many sondry obstacles and lettes to
cause hym to tary / that in his course
he 
                     •
                  all not heedling in the botomlas
pit of Ignorance, while he is in the
way to rebel again his maker & most
mercifull lorde. These necessarye lettes
be diseses & siknessis, wherby bodily
strēgth is abated, and therwith
carnal affectis oppressid or minished / 
Aduersite, vexatiō & trouble wherbi
stordy courage pride & ambitiō, & other
like malāders of the minde may
be curid / or at the lest wayes reformed.
And besydes these, be other obstacles,
wherby man shall be war
                  
                     •
                  id
of his arrogance / whan he to
moche presumeth on his propre power,
knowlege, and industry. And
therfore he wyll frely vse all thinges
at his pleasure / wherin his sences
haue dilectation, and his appetite
moueth hym. These thynges god
foreseinge (as I sayde byfore) most

louingely and wysely prouydynge
for his mooste dereste creatoure,
agaynste the sayde perylle of forgettefulnesse,
like as he made manne
of soule and bodye, so with thinges
necessary and profitable to the body
he ordaynid thynges also necessarye
& profitable vnto the soule, sowinge
amonge the herbis, that be holsome
or plesant, other noysom and venemous.
In the grene banke lyeth the
serpente hidde / redy with his trembling
tunge to stryke mortally them
whiche doo approche hym. The
scorpion woūden in the grene grasse / 
lyeth watching with his forked tail
in a redynes to styng thē / which loke
not down to their fete. The bodi infected
or woūded, findeth in pain & anguishe
his owne, ꝓpre ignoraunce / in
that / that he so moche estemed dilectation
& plesure / which in so short
a momente vanysshed awaye. Also
sens a lyttell herbe / whiche is inanimate,

maye chaunge pleasure in to
peyne / and helthe into syckenes / or a
lyttell vile worme at one stroke may
bircue hym of all dilectation and
pleasure, and fylle hym with so moche
anguysshe and dolour, that the
lyfe / whiche he desyred euer to continue
becōmeth to hym tedious and
lothesome / he shall therby not onely
remembre / that he is passible / & therfore
no god, but also perceyue and
consyder of how lyttell importance
or valour is than his strength / auctoritie / 
or puis
                     •
                  ance, were he neuer so
myghty a champion or so puisant a
kynge or Emperour. And with that
remembraunce the parte sensible beinge
rebuked, vnderstandynge eftesoones
resorteth vnto the soule, and
helpeth her to reforme all her holle
householde / settynge eftesones euery
thyng in his propre place and office,
as it was before free wylle was corrupted.
And if than the soule be circumspecte / 

& do restrayne VVIL of
hir lybertie, compellynge hir to be
subiecte and so obediente to raison,
that withoute hir consente she shall
dare to doo nothynge: than the craftye
perswasions of the sencis shall no
thinge auayle, but they them selfes
wyll they or no, shall be constrayned
to be styll drudges vnto the soule as
they were ordayned. But if manne
do forgette to sette Wyll vnder the
gouernaunce of rayson / and with a
circumspect deliberation, to appoint
vnto hir limites and bondes whiche
she shall not be so hardy to passe or
excede. After the body is eskaped
from aduersyte, or is delyuered of
vehement peine and anguisshe, forth
with the senses do prepare thē selfes
eftsones to rebell. And affectes whiche
as wanton girles be flexible or
redy to inclyne to euery motion, do
prepare them with wanton countenaunce
and pleasaunt promyses to

allure eftesones Wille to their appetite:
wherby the soule shalbe ageyn
in daunger to perysshe / onelasse she
retaynynge still with hir vnderstandynge,
in consyderynge hir propre
state and condition, and reuoluinge
what she before hadde suffred / doo
put Wyll in to the prison of Drede / 
vnder the streyte custodie of Remē
                  braunce
and Rayson. And in this
wyse as I haue rehersed / not onely
he that suffreth, receyueth commodite
of this wonderfull prouidence:
but also other whiche doo beholde
hym that sufferith, or hereth it sufficiently
reported may and ought ther
by examine the state of his owne persone / 
and as mortall and passible and
no god / but the ymage of god by vnderstandynge,
endeuoure them selfe
to kepe that in perfection, hauing in
good awayte, that they lette not affectes
become to malapert / but that
the soule haue vnderstanding alway

at her elbowe, whiche shall bydde
raison correcte Wylle, if he be conuersaunt
with these affectes. And
than shall man stylle remayne without
any of the sayde transformations
that we before spake of: and
vse euery thynge accordynge to the
effecte that they were fyrste ordayned
for hym: whiche is the cause finall,
wherof I haue spoken / and
promisyd to declare vnto the, wherin
shynethe the wonderfull prouydence,
wherby god is best knowen.
Howe sayst thou Aristippus? doest
thou beare away & perceyue what
I haue al this whyle spoken?
            
            
               ARI.
               ye that I do Plato, all thoughe hit
be meruayllous: but yet me semeth
thou haste omitted somewhat / whiche
shulde make of all that whiche
thou spakest a perfecte conclusion.
            
            
               PLA.
               Trowest thou so? Mary I
pray the telle me what lacketh, as
thou doest suppose, and I wyll amēde

that gladly / for I wold be loth
that in that, whiche we go aboute / 
shulde be founde imperfection.
            
            
               AR.
               I remembre / thou haste affirmed
through al thy resoning, that al
                     •
                  hinges
in respecte of theyr creatyon be
good / and that all was created for
man: More ouer that some thynges,
whiche doo seme to be ylle, in
very dede be not so, but be all good
in theyr order of theyr creatyon.
               And for profe of that thou dyddest
induce by example, that aduersite / 
and syknesse, dyd cure or mitigate
affectes and vanites of the mynde.
Also that venemous herbes, serpentes,
and wormes / whiche semed to
haue in them nothynge but malyce
onely, by anoyinge of menne that
were sensual, folowyng theyr affectes,
and forgettynge their state / with
peyne and anguysshe, birefte them
theyr pleasure, wherin they delyted,
and made them remembre / that

they were passible: and by that consideration
to reforme thē selfes accordyng
to their firste perfection / wher
in they were ordayned. And so diddest
thou conclude / that aduersitie,
syckenes, venemous herbes and bestes
were good to that respect. And
therfore necessarily prouyded of god
to the vse of man. Nowe for as moche
as all men be not sensuall / nor
ladde with carnall affectes or vanities:
but some men kepynge the sences
in theyr propre office or duetie / 
also kepynge Wyll (as I moughte
vse thy wordes) within the precinct
prescribed to hir by vnderstandyng:
nede not so sharpe a monytion, as
thou haste spoken of, where aduersitie / 
syckenes, venemous matter / or
bestes do as sone and greuously anoy
or hurt those good menne / as them
that be vicious: howe dareste thou
affirme them to be good? or declare
them to be a parte of prouidence,

wherby the goodnesse of god is expressed?
These thynges considered
me thynketh Plato, thy conclusion
(as I sayd) is yet insufficient.
            
            
               PLA.
               In dede Aristippus it semeth, that
thou haste diligently herd me: but
I feare me, that for the olde controuersies
betwene vs thou markest
more what I saye, to take me with
some l
                     •
                  cke / than to beare awaye &
obserue any thynge that may profyte
the to knowe, in as moche as
my conclusion / whiche thou reprouest
is not so insufficiēt as thou doest
suppose. Thou knowest that Scammony
gyuen where nede is, and in a
due and conuenient proportion, healeth
them which be vexed with melancoly,
but excedyng his measure / 
or taken where that humour doeth
not abounde / in the stede of helthe
bryngeth mortall sycknesse almooste
incurable. The same dothe Thapsia,
Agaricus, and dyuers other / which

do pourge the body of superfluous
humours. The fruites named Millones
and Cocombres aswageth the
inordinate heate that procedethe of
colere: yet in them whiche eyther
by nature or occasion haue their belyes
colde / they procure intollerable
tormentes or frettinges. Mandragora / 
and the iuise of Popie, called
Opium, to them whiche by some innaturall
cause be lette from slepe / do
profite moche, if they be measurably
taken: cōtrary wyse if they be taken
by him that is moch fleumatike,
and of nature disposed to slepe very
soundly, and also the medicine excedeth
his portion / he bringethe the
patient in to so depe a slepe / that he
neuer awakethe. But all thoughe
these thinges, whiche I haue rehersed
yf they haue not ioyned vnto
them Oportunitie and measure, do
brynge either damage or dethe to
them whiche receyue them: yet no

man do accompte them for yll: but
beinge putte in the nombre of medicines,
wherby mannes bodye is cured
                     •
                  
they be called good.
               ¶Is there any thinge amonge men
better or reputed more profytable
than lawes: And yet was there neuer
law made by any man so perfit,
but that diuerse haue therby sustayned
detriment, ye some that wyllingly

by addyng to sondry opinions, be so
inuolued or wrapped in doubtis,
that they whiche ones were and
ought to be open and playne to the
people / whiche lyueth vnder them,
and be bounde to obey them, maye
not without longe debatynge and
great chargis / be declared sufficiently
And yet who is so moche displesed
with any lawe, but that he wyll
affirme, that lawes be good / ye &
all though it happen somtime that
they be yll executed.
               
                  ¶Lyke wyse the venemous herbes / 
beastes and fysshes to that ende
and purpose, which I haue declarid / 
whervnto thei be ordeinid, be good / 
whiche thou doest not denye me.
               And than by the examples that I
haue rehersed / my conclusion in declaration
of prouidence is good & sufficient.
For if thou thynkest, that I
shulde haue proued those thynges
to haue ben so absolutely good / that
they mought not be to ani respect il,
than thou lackest that naturall wyt,
whiche all this whyle I supposed
hadde ben in the. For I wolde haue
thought that thou haddest knowen,
that nothynge is in this worlde so
good / but that hit may brynge damage
to some man. Fynally that vnder
the region of the Moone is nothīg
so good that it is not mixt with
some yll / but remaynyng in their ꝓpre
degrees of order / wherof I haue
spoken, one is better than an other,

and be neuer yll but by disordre: and
there also one is wars thā an other,
by the degrees, I do meane the causes
wherfore they were ordeyned.
As by exāple to declare it more plainly:
doest thou remembre Aristippus,
whan we were spekynge of order &
disorder, that thou saidest, that som
beastis were ordeyned for manne to

                     •
                  ate, some to cladde hym with, some
to tylle his lande, other to ryde on,
lykewise herbes / frutes, and trees / 
some to serue for nouryshyng, diuers
for medicine / and other to buylde
with?
            
            
               ARI.
               Ye I do remēbre that
well.
            
            
               PLA.
               Nowe marke well Arist.
The Oxe, which tilleth the lāde,
beareth befe / wherwith man is noryshed / 
& his hyde serueth to make
shoen to saue mens feete from colde
and other anoyance. The shepe beareth
wolle to cladde with the body
of manne commodiously. And his
fleshe is good to be eaten / and where

he lackethe puissaunce to drawe the
ploughe or the wayne / in stede therof
he goinge and lyinge on the lande
with his ordure and pysse / compasseth
the grounde, and maketh it
fertile and able to bere plētie of corn.
Wherfore these two be sette in one
degree in the lyne of order. The
horse and all other beastes / whiche
be lyke to that kynde, wylle
drawe or carye. And also their hydes
wylle serue to that pourpose / 
that the oxe hyde doeth. But theyr
fleshe is not apte to be eaten of men.
Wherfore they be a degree vnder
the other: And soo consequentely
all thynges as they be profytable
more or lasse vnto man / if he doo vse
them, so be they hygher or lower in
degree in the sayde lyne of order.
               And yf an Oxe or a shepe haue moche
flesshe on hym and sweete, he
is named therfore a good oxe or a
good shepe. If a horse or a mule wyl

beare a great waight, & go far iournayes,
he is named a good horse or
a good mule. And although a man
aduisedly or vnaduisedly doo eate
more beoffe or mutton than his stomake
wyll beare, and therwith is
sicke / the oxe or the shepe ought not
therfore to be called ylle. Nor if a
man take awaye thy money or garmentes / 
and laye it on thyne owne
horse or mule, and carye hit awaye
with hym: this letteth not, but that
thy horse or mule shall be called styll
good. But if thou wylte ryde by
poste on thyne oxe / or thy shepe, or
roste thy horse or thy mule to banket
with thy frendes, to those pourposes
thou canste nat calle any of
them good. For they be out of their
propre degrees or placis in the lyne
of order: and therfore they be nowe
ylle. Semblably if in to thy potage / 
wherwith thou intendest to be nourished / 
thou doest cause to be putte

suche herbes as do serue for violent
purgations: or into thy salade chyppes
of ooke, or of mapull, or buyldeste
thy house with stalkes of fenell
or malowes / or couerest it with
the leues of letis or beetis: these herbes
or trees so vsed doo ceasse to be
good, and may to these pourposes
be nowe called yll. So there is nothynge
that is perfectly good but
god onely / and all other thynges the
nerre they approche towarde his
similitude / the more doo they drawe
to that perfection / and the higher be
they in the lyne of order / wherof I
spake at the begynnynge.
               ¶This that I haue nowe sayd Aristippus,
if thou dost wel reuolue in
thy mynde & consider, thou shalt not
fynde that lacke in my conclusion,
that thou haste obiected. But yet to
satisfi the throughly, that in no part
thou shalte thynke my raison vayne
or vnprofitable / wylt thou see / that

I shall sufficiently proue / that syckenes,
aduersitie / matter, or bestes venemous,
beinge in their degrees in
the lyne of order, be neuer ylle: but
to that ende and pourpose that they
were made for, thei be alway good?

               I think, to proue that it shalbe
impossible.
            
            
               PLA.
               Perchance nay.
But forgette not that I protested,
that the hole prouidence and iudgemētes
of god be to man, whyle he is
mortal inscrutable / & ferre aboue his
imagynation or knowledge: yet of
his infinite goodnes he holdeth him
contented / that with due reuerence
we shal measurably serche for them / 
only to the intent therby the more to
knowe hym, honour hym, and loue
hym: & after that maner do I nowe
endeuour me with the helpe of his
spirite to proue, that his prouidence
is excellent and most to be wondred
at / in that thynge wherin thou and
many other do suppose that prouidence

lacketh.
            
            
               AR.
               If thou canste
brynge that well to passe, I wylle
than saye that the same and renome
of thy wysedome / that is spronge
through oute Grece, is well employed.
And I wyll affirme also, that
kynge Dyonise, whan he gaue the
to Dolidis / was more liberall than
wyse. For he hadde bene better to
haue gyuen to hym sixe the beste cities
in Sicile, than to haue departed
from suche a counsayllour.
            
            
               PLA.
               Well I truste to verifie thy good opinion.
But nowe alyttel while answere
to suche questions as I wylle
demaunde the.
               ¶Be not we agreed that man is of
soule and bodye, And that the soule
is immortall and intelligible, but the
bodye is mortal and sensible?
            
            
               ARISTIPPVS.
               Yes, no doute thereof.
            
            
               PLATO.
               We be also accorded, that
all other thynges in this worlde
were made chiefely for manne.
            
            
               
               ARI.
               Ye so god helpe me.
            
            
               PLA.
               And I trowe thou wylt not denye,
that god is all goodnes, and that he
made man vnto his own image and
similitude.
            
            
               ARI.
               No verily.
            
            
               PLA.
               If god made any thynge to the intēt
that it shulde be ylle vnto man, whiche
is his propre similitude, it shuld
than seme that there shulde be some
malice in god / whiche were not onely
vntrue / but also to affirme horrible
& vnlefull. Wherfore the contrary
muste nedes be true, that god
made euery thyng to the intent that
it shulde be good vnto man: But
how that may appere in such thynges
as thou haste rehersed, whiche
seme to be ylle / theron restethe oure
question. Nowe take hede Aristippus.
The soule of man beynge immortall
neuer dyeth or cesseth to be / 
but after that it is ioyned with the
body / the body lyuynge / hit lyueth
also / shewynge therby hir operations.

And whan lyfe departith from
the body, the soule also departith immediatly
notwithstandyng she afterward
liueth. Than if whan she was
ioyned to the bodye / she retayned
the sencis and affectes in due obedience,
not sufferynge them to excede
theyr duetie or offices, And haue vntylle
the seperation of hir frome the
body, ensued alwaye the counsayle
of Vnderstanding and Rayson, and
so haue contynued in the forme of a
man, Surely after hir departynge
frome the bodye, accordynge as by
hir operation the body abounded in
vertues so is she than immediately
with god, whose similitude she so
well hath kept, and there is promoted
to ioye and pleasure perpetualle
more or lasse after hir merites.
               And that pleasure beinge intellectuall / 
shall more excede the dilectations
of the bodye, whiche onely be
sensuall / than perfecte helthe doeth

excede syckenes, or the greattest reioysinge
of the mynde that manne
mought possible haue of a sensuall
motion, mought surmount the grettest
discomforte or henynesse. God
desyringe that all soules moughte
come to this ioye / to warne them of
theyr office whome he seeth neelygent,
he sufferith the bodye, wherwith
they be ioyned (as I sayde before)
to be touched with sondrye
aflictions, to the intente that they

               Than thou doest admitte, that a surgion
is good, and that his arte is
good and profytable. But is his art
declared by any thynge elles but by
his medicines, or instrumētes wherwith
he doth cutte / perse, or cantherize / 
as necessitie of the wounde or
soore doeth require?

               Yes / there

               Thou speakest raisonably.
And therfore see that thou

Now thy father doeth perceyue by
his coūnyng / that this disease requirith
sharp medicines as those which

Nowe wylt thou see what I
meane hereby? Is any so proprely
thy father as god which is the first / 
the chiefe / and immediate cause of
thy generation? or is any surgeon so
counnynge as he, whiche seeth more
plainely the original motion & cause
of euery disese of the soule, that is to
say of vicious affectes, than any man
can see the outeward sore or skurfe

of the fistula? And more perfectely
knoweth the best remedye therfore /

               P.
               Now sens ones thou
hast graunted to me / that vice is yll,
bycause it is contrary to vertue / whiche
thou affyrmiddest to be good
                     •
                  
suppose vice to be the sycknes of the
soule as it is in dede: and for as moche
as it bringeth in ignorance / whiche
is ennemie to rayson and knowlege / 
who be as the eyen of the soule,
and if it growe moche it deformeth
the soule and putteth clene away vnderstandynge / 
whiche is the visage,
wherin (as I sayd) is the similitude
of god / therfore resemble it vnto the
fistula. Whiche foule & daungerous
disease God as a louyng father and
good surgion espyinge in the / and desyryng
to heale the therof, doth his
cure more spedyly and quyckely / he

vseth sharpe medicines / touchynge
the with sickenes (wherin I recken
as well diseases growyng in the bodye,
as also hurte or griefes by outwarde
occasion or chaunce) or with
Aduersitie, by wrongefull imprisonment / 
deathe of assured frendes, towardly
chyldren, or of a wyfe, constant

obserue the diete, wherto he doeth
appoynt the: that is to say doest liue
in the custome of vertue, eschuynge
vicious cōmunication, yl counsayle,
and flatery / which be the vnholsom
and quaysy metes of the soule, wherby
is ingendred the venemous humour
of ylle opinion, wherof commeth
vice / whiche I haue resembled

vnto the fistula: thou shalt be cured
and haue the sight and visage of thy
soule preserued pure and clene: Contrarye
wyse if thou mourmour or
grudge at the sayde remedies / estemyng
thē as grefes & no medicines,
blamynge or repriuynge god as vndiserete
or cruelle in the ministration
of them and stryuing there agaynst / 
with the powar of thy sencis, vsing
them dishonestly in som pleasure voluptuouse / 
thou tournest them from
the sore / wheron they shulde warke,
and with them doest thou putte out
rayson and knowledge, the eyen of
the soule: And than for thy folysshenesse,
impacience, and blasphemye / 
God sufferinge thy soule to be both
blynde with Ignoraunce, and defourmed
with vice, sens thou haste
vtterlye loste his gloryous symylitude,

abiecte the, and for thyne vnkyndenesse
commytte the to perpetualle

prisone / there to be punysshed in
derkenes, where thy foule defourmed
visage shall neuer be sene / to the
reproche of hym, vnto whose similitude
thou were created. Nowe
Aristipp. sens thou diddest approue
that whiche was done by the carnal
father & surgeon to be good, bicause
he did it with Iustice & raison / what
saist thou to that which god ordayneth
& doth who so farre excelleth in
those two qualities: that the iustice
executed amōg mē that be mortal / in
cōparison of his Iustice / is wronge: &
that which we take for raison, in regard
of his wisdom is folishnes & fā
                  tasi,
not bicause it is nat iustice & resō
that we haue: but bicause that which
is in god is euer one & ꝑfect / without
any diuision or mixture?
            
            
               A.
               In good
faith Plato, I wote not well what
to say to the. Finally I am cōpelled
by that argumente that thou haste
made, to agree / that suche thynges

whiche before semed to me to be yl,
be to that respecte whiche thou hast
reher

is to saye / in the refourmyng of mās
soule where it is curable / and in the
declaration of the Iustyce of god,
where man is incurable. But what
sayest thou to that which h
                     •
                  u hast
so lyghtely passed ouer? I meane
where the sayde diseases and afflixions
hapneth to hym, whiche is allredy
good / and nedeth not so sharpe
reformation?
            
            
               PL.
               Why Aristippus,
supposest thou that euer any manne
was so good / that in hym were neuer
vicious affectiō? Perdic our may

                     •
                  ier Socrates, whan he was yonge,
and wroughte in a Masons shoppe
with his 
                     •
                  ather, was not so pure
from affectes as he was after that
he hadde ben the herer of Anaxagoras:
by whose doctrine, and also beinge
continually vexed with pouertie / 
sondry reproches, and somtyme

stripes of malicious & quarellyng ꝑsons:
Also with the continual & neuer
cessing brauling & chiding of his most
cursed wife Xanthippa which he callid
his domestical excercise / he by the
gentyll vertue of pacience became a
good man as he was called and taken.
But to the intente that thy
mynde maye be satysfied, Let vs
nowe admitte / that men whiche be
good / or at the lefte haue suche abundance
of vertue, and so lyttel do
inclyne to vicious affectes / that hit
requireth not, that they be purged
with suche sharpe afflixions, as we
haue spoken of. Howe sayest thou?
supposist thou that vnto them the
sayde afflixions be ylle and vnprofitable?
            
            
               AR.

               PL.
               Surely Aristippus
that is not onely vnlefull to speake,
but also to thynke it, hit is greatte

presumption and folye. And that
shall I well proue if thou wylte attentifely

               In all the trayne of
oure communication hitherto, sens
we began to speke of prouidence, it
hath alwaye appered, that god is
father to man by creation, and loueth
man aboue all his creatures:
But what sayest thou / Is there any
more token of loue than whan the father
with al his study & power endeuoreth
him self to bring his sonne to
great honour which if he may bring
to good passe / there is nothing maye
cause him so moche to reioyce?

               And to the
intent that his sonne maye be demed
of all men worthy to be promotid to
honoure he accustometh hym to trauayle
either in lernynge and studye,
or els in corporall exercise, the one
to make him wise / the other to make
hym stronge and valiaunt in bodye / 

wherby he maye declare hym selfe
worthy to haue promotion. And
wyse fathers the better that they
loue theyr sonnes / the more diligent
be they, And as I mowghte saye
the more importune in kepyng them
in continual exercise, thynkyng that
therby the strength and delyuernesse
of the bodye increacith / and if hit be
in study of mynd / wyt is augmēted:
lyke as contrary wyse by sluggardy
& idelnes the said actiuite is apalled

               If the sonne be of gentill
disposition / and lyke to his father / 
perceyuinge his fathers honest
desyre and purpose / and therwith
being inflamed with desyre of glory / 
he wyll not onely content hym with
laboure, but also if his father doo

wyll offre to assayle him. And whan

               PLA.
               Also
nothynge hapneth withoute him
which is the first & principal mouer,
either helth or sicknesse, prosperite or
aduersitie / riches or pouertie / and he
beareth the kais of life and deth, for
he that made and dyd put the soule
in to the body, hathe the power to
plucke it out: supposist thou that any
other hath with hym equall authoritie?

               No. I grauntid longe
agone, that as he is one in begynninge / 
so is he euer one in gouernaunce / 
and maye suffer no ptere or
lyke in equalite.
            
            
               PLA.
               That is remembred
very well of the Arystippus.
Nowe by that we two haue
gatherid / it appereth (& if thou loke

well) that nothinge is made yll of
god. And thā nede we no further argumēt,
But s
                     •
                  ns god made al thīges
for mā, whom he loueth / what exterior
thinge so euer happeneth to any
good man, it is good. And therfore
siknesse, aduersitie, and dethe if they
happen to a good man be good.
               And therfore hit shulde suffise to a
good man if he suffre any of the said
afflixions / to thynke and say to him
selfe: God whiche sente to me this,
is all good, & hath in hym none yll / 
nor any yll procedeth of hym, and
I am one of the nombre of those
creatures, whome he loueth beste:
wherfore this that he hath sent me / 
is good and not ylle, sens hit is necessarye
that I be therwith contentid / 
and take heede that with myne
opinion I make not that yll whiche
is good.
               ¶But although this were sufficiēt
to satisfye a good man, who wolde

not labour to seke any further in the
prouidence of god: yet to the Aristippus
who beinge longe nosyllyd
in wordly pleasures, wilt not admit
that any thynge, which is thervnto
contrari, may be expedient or necessary
vnto a man that is vertuous / and
lacketh suche vice / whiche requireth
sharp admonition, and therfore
thou requirest a more ample & large
declaration: I wyll sette out a more
plaine profe in applieng my raysons
to the examples & similitudes / which
I haue alredy induced.
               ¶God who made manne vnto his
ymage, and louethe hym with
more feruent affection than any carnall
father loueth his childe, bringeth
vs vppe in the exercise of the
commune imbecilitie or feblenesse of
oure nature, as hunger / thurste / 
colde, werynes after labour / annoyaunce,
displeasures / whiche do happen
in the societie or lyuinge of men

together, diseases wherin is no ieoperdie / 
and suche other littell incommodities / 
incident to mortalitie: of
al the whiche no man may be quite,
declaring vnto vs by Vnderstāding / 
that in this life we must of necessitie
trauaile and suffer / therwith geuing
vs cōforte / that who so euer by this
exercise waxeth stronge and hardy,
hereafter beinge brought where he
shal proue his strength agaynst puissaunte
& mighty aduersaries / that is
to saye anguisshe and peine / sharpe
and perillouse sickenes / cruel aduersitie
in any thing that fortune semeth
to rule / losse of children / frendes / or
fauour of princis / prisonment / or exile / 
and like other tourmentes / and
vexations of body and mynde: if he
valiantli do resist and with fortitude
whiche is the strengthe of the mind,
do subdue and vanquisshe those aduersaries,
he shall haue the rewarde
that belongeth to good men / which

no tyme can consume, no powar can
minisshe / none euyll can deface. And
to whette the courage of man to desire
this ēterprise / god giueth to him
this comforte, that these thynges
whiche shall so sharply assayle him,
be ordaynedde onelye to proue his
strength, and that they be inferiours
vnto hym, if he put out his strength
to the vttermoste / sens god whiche
louith hym aboue all his creatures / 
hath ordayned nothynge to the intent
to distroy hym, but to his benefyte,
if he doo employe his power
and wyll thervnto, accordynge as
he hath receyuid them.
               ¶Now if the soule haue in the bodye
intire domynion and rule, And
that man be in his right fascion (as
I sayde longe ago) that is to saye
lyke to his father: of his noble nature
he desyrithe to wynne that in
comparable price, whiche is promysed
to them that shal be so happy to

gette the victorye, wherfore in this
wyse he armith therto his courage / 
¶Fyrst he consydereth that his father
is good, and that he moste tenderly
louethe hym. Also that he
brought hym not vp from the fyrste
tyme that he lyued, in those littell exercises
of naturall infirmitie in vaine
or without any purpose. But to the
intente that thereby he shall fele (as
it were) the sente of more greuouse
afflictions, wherof they be but the
shadowes, and by a lyttell laboure
and sufferaunce / he shal prepare him selfe,
to sustayne and contempne a
more greater trauayle and pacience.
He reuoluith also in his mynd, that
euery man whiche in his harte desireth
honour, couayteth some honest
occupaion or labour, and is prompt
and alway forward to do his office
or duetie in euery perill or daungier.
For / to what wyse and dylygente
man is it not a peine to be ydle? And

yet where idelnes is not, nedes must
be labour. And where an aduersary
lacketh, prowesse lieth hid & vnknowē.
What a mā may or may not paciēce
declareth. The fathers bedeth
theyr children to apply them ernestly
to study or laboure / and wyll not
lette them be ydle although it be holy
daye, and doo constrayne them to
sweate and often tymes to weepe.
               Where the mothers wold sette thē
on theyr lappes, and kepe them atte
home all the day in the shadowe for
burnynge theyr white. God hath
toward good men and women the
mynde of a father & best doeth loue
them: & therfore he vexith thē with
sondry busynes, griefes, & damages,
that they may therby gather a substācial
strēgth, sins they which be frā
                  kid

and with theyr owne burdon be
shortly suffocat. It is to men no litle

For the syght whiche is worthy to
haue god the beholder therof / is to
se the creature, which he louith best
to trye his strength with fortune or
anguishe, if he be chalengid / for therby
strength whiche is a vertue and

               But looke to the other fortitude or

of suche thynges, whiche opinion
doth set forth, with a terrible visage

                  tention

dethe shall dissolue it / for it is not for

               ¶Aduersitie is not so greuous, bycause
it is oute of the body, and nothynge
compelleth vs to suffre but
our owne wylles. For if we were
content with that whiche onely our

nature hath gyuen vs, we shuld not
be constrayned to knowe what that
worde Aduersitie mente, But sens
we contempne hir as nedy and myserable / 
and sue to come in to the seruice
of fortune / whose nature is to
be alwaye mutable and euer inconstant,
nor gyueth any thyng, but lendethe
hit onely. If we receyue any
thyng of hir mocky she hande what
shall it greue vs to paye that agayne
whiche we haue borowed? why
shulde we eyther be vngentyll creditours / 
or be angrye that we can nat
tourne the nature of hir that wylle
not obey or folowe any mans commaundement
or counsaylle / but may
be subdued with paciēce, where she
can neuer be vanquysshed with raison?
Moreouer god is content that
we shall excelle hym in that that he
may not suffre ylle, and we maye by
sufferaunce subdue hit. For he is in
more estimation that hath ouercom

a puisaunt and valiant enemy, than
he whiche hath none ennemye at all.
Thou receyueste of thy father this
comfort, that no mā lyueth so poorely
in the worlde as he came into hit.
And he hathe nede of a lyttell that
measureth aboundance by natures
necessitie / and not by superfluitie of
ambicious desyre. Grefe shall dissolue
or elles be dissolued. Fortune
hath not so sharpe a weapon that it
may byte on the soule. And whome
she lengest supporteth & with moste
aboundance of all thynge, them for
a generall rule god lytell fauoureth:
sens there is no rewarde, where lacketh
merite. Contrarywise the ende
of trauaylle is ease: And the father
whiche beholdeth his sonne labour
mightily / reioyceth therat, and prepareth
that after his labour he may
lyue pleasantly. Who, knowynge a
great hepe of golde to be hydde on
the toppe of a rough hylle / wolde

not crepe vppe through thornes and
brembles to fetche it? and although
his visage & handis were scratched,
and his body and legges greuously
prycked, yet wold he not cesse vntyl
he came to the toppe. And if any
man whiche behelde hym thus trauayllynge,
wold call hym wretched
and foolysshe: he sayinge nothynge,
wolde thynke how happy and welthy
he shall be, whan he hath opteined
that thynge / wherfore he laboreth,
And doeth laughe at the ignorance
or foly of them / whiche for a
peyne that dureth nat longe, wyl for
beare to goo with hym and to be
partners of that, wherby they shall
euer after be welthy.
               ¶Golde is a coruptible mater, and
shall ones be consumed, but that tresure,
wherfore mannes soule ought
to labour / may neuer be wasted / or
in any qualitie or quantite appayred
or minysshed: that is to say, it shall

euer be lyke good and lyke moche.
Wherfore what peyne so euer be taken
about the gettynge therof, it is
not greuous, hauynge respect to the
gayne. Nor he that trauayleth therfore
maye be named myserable or
wretched: sens Miserye is the priuacion
or lacke of all maner of comforte.
For in hope of victory if thou
faylle not thy selfe, comforte is redy,
if thou doest not refuse it. In so moche
as nothynge is miserable, but if
thou doest so thynke it. For all Fortune
is good to hym that constantly
suffreth. And who was euer so fortunate,
that whan he was subdued
with impacience / dydde not desyre
to chāge his astate? Suffiseth it not
to the that he that vanquyssheth is
demed honorable, and he that is recreant
is wretched and miserable?
Howe shall it be knowen / on what
part thou standist without an experience?
If thou haue alwaye good

wyll, strength neuer fayleth the: but
if by the puisanee of fortune thou be
set on thy knee / haue a good harte,
for god standeth at thyn elbow / and
if thou thynke on him, he wyll sette
the vp and make thy strengthe double
as moche as it was. Wylt thou
lerne one good poynt of defence, whiche
may perchance do the ease agein

               ¶Fortune hathe taken frome the

               PLATO.
               THe fyrste entre into our
disputation Aristippus,
(if I be not forgetfull &
vnlyke to that I was
wonte to be) was that
thou beheldest me in this pore astate
and apparaylle, the occasion wherof
I declared to the in the forme of a
story: whiche although it semed to
the to be more than in the aunswere
of a Philosopher was expediente / 
whiche shulde vse in fewe wordes
moche matter and quycke to the purpose:
yet examinynge diligently euery
thyng therin included, it shal well
appere vnto the / that nothing therof
mought haue ben omitted, the wordes
whiche we spake before / with
my profession beinge well ponderid.
            
            
               
               AR.
               Me thinkith thou saiest truly,
nowe that I haue consyderid euery
thynge depely.
            
            
               PL.
               But yet Aristippus
as I doo consyder, me seemeth
to that purpose that we go aboute,
the argument whiche I haue made
lacketh yet some what to make hir
perfecte.
            
            
               AR.
               Trowist thou so? In
good faythe I doo not perceyue hir,
for as me semith thou haste touchid
euery thynge hansomely.
            
            
               PL.
               I am
glad that it doeth so well please the.
But Aristipp. thou doest remembre
that we were both agreed that wisdome
is knowlege?
            
            
               AR.
               Ye that is
truth, and so haue I herde it alway
defyned.
            
            
               PL.
               But se whyther that
knowlege only maketh one to be callid
a wise mā. Is not wisdom good?
What sayst thou therto?
            
            
               AR.
               Why
thynkest thou that I am suche a fole
that I wyll denye it?
            
            
               PL.
               No so I
trowe. Nowe admytte that a man
knewe all that we haue hytherto

talked of, concernynge the goodnes
and prouidence of god, but in dede
he lereth his sencis and affectis haue
the rule ouer his soule / & in his actes
abuseth the saide goodnes & prouidēce.
If thou pecyuiddest him to do
this / woldest thou suppose him to be
a good mā.
            
            
               AR.
               No verily.
            
            
               PLA.
               Thou woldest say perchance that he
were ill / bicause that his actes were
cōtrari to good, but to his knowlege
thou woldest take lyttell regarde.
            
            
               AR.
               In good fayth thou sayst truly.
            
            
               PL.
               If a man named to be a tilar
wolde telle the that thy house were
yll tyled, and that the morter was
ylle tempred, by reson that the lime
was to hote, & the holes of the tyles
were made to wide for the pinnes, &
that the lathes were rent in the nayling / 
& thou foundest al that he saide
to be true: thou woldest suppose him
to be a good tylar. But if cōmyng to
his own house thou shuldest fynd it

necligētly couerid by him, his tiles &
lath so set out of order, that the rayn
and snow dyd bete into eueri place,
wherby the beames and rafters of
the house were decayid and rotten / 
& therby all the house in ieoperdy to
fal down euery houre: woldest thou
calle hym than a good tylar or no?
            
            
               AR.
               Nay in good fayth, I wolde
calle him but a prater.
            
            
               PL.
               Bycause
that wher he ought most, he did not
practise his cūnyng, whiche he had
often auāted.
            
            
               AR.
               Ye in good faith.
            
            
               PL.
               And that were but raison. Thā
                  
                     •
                   semeth that knowlege is indifferēt
to good & to yll: but although goodnes
being in knowlege / maketh that
knowlege to be good, yet he whiche
hath that goodnes is neuer the more

                     •
                   good mā
                  
                     •
                   except by the exercise of
the same goodnes the thinge that is
good apperith in his act. For that is
manifest, and declareth what the mā
is / knowlege is secrete and bryngeth

forth no frute but by operatiō. And
thou arte agreed, that wysedome is
good. Wherfore no more thā knowlege
of goodnesse maketh one to be
named a good man, No more doth
knowledge of wysedom onely cause
any persone to be named a wise mā.
And that was affirmed bi the in the
begynnynge of our communication:
where it was agreed that kyng Dionise
desyred to see me, to the intent
that he moughte beholde, if in my
countenaunce, speche, or forme of lyuynge
I dydde expresse that thynge,
wherfore he herde me commended,
whiche was nothyng but wysdom.
Than if I were a wise man / it ought
to be declared by operation, whiche
is not in man without knowlege precedynge
or goynge before / wherof
procedeth election, whiche lacketh
naturally in other beastes. Wherefore
all though wisedome be knowlege,
yet by knowledge onely none

may be called a wise man, but operation
of that whiche is in knowledge
called wysedome / expressynge
the wysedome, maketh the vser or
exercisar therof to be iustly named a
wyse man.
            
            
               AR.
               Now on my faith
Plato thou art a wonderfull felow,
for by the subtil persuasiōs brought
in by induction, whiche forme of arguynge
I knowe is moste naturalle,
thou compellest me to assent alwaye
to thy raison. For now me thinketh
that none may be called a wise man,
excepte vnto that knowlege, wherin
is wysedome, he ioyneth operation:
but for what pourpose I praye the
haste thou brought in nowe this last
conclusion?
            
            
               PL.
               Arte thou so dulle
wytted Aristip. that all this whyle
thou doest not perceyue hit? Perdie
the occasion of all our long raisoning
dydde ryse of that / that I assayed
to proue that if I were a wyse man
in dede / myn answere to kynge Dionyse

declared me to be so, accordinge
to his expectation. And therfore fyrst
as rayson was / I soughte for wysedom
And in our cōmunication it appered
to be in man onely, and not in
beastes: & that it was in knowlege
of hym selfe and other. And that
knowlege was in this wise declarid.
First to know his owne preeminēce
and dignitie ouer al other creatures,
hir was remembred that he was of
bodye and soule, wherby he was
man, and was made to the image &
similitude of god, and that all other
creatures were made onely for him
and to his vse principally. The sayd
similitude was expressed to be in the
soule as well for that it is visible and
immortal / as also in vnderstandyng,
whereby she hath souerayntie and
rule in the bodye, as god hath ouer
all vniuersally. Moreouer that the
sences / affectes / and wylle, be he
seruauntes and minystres: whiche

if she do kepe in suche obedience and
order / as she receyued them, she shal
euer remayne in authorytie. But if
she lette them to haue more libertie
than perteyneth to them, that is to
say / to delyte in thynges whiche be
corruptible, they wyll than conspire
and rebelle agayne vnderstandynge,
and driue him from the soule / & than
shulde man be transformed frome
the image of god vntyl a brute beest / 
beinge gouerned and ruled onely by
sensis. ¶The seconde parte
of the saide knowlege was opened
bi the discription of the goodnes and
prouidence of god. In describynge
his goodnes, was declared his powar,
his perfection / and loue that he
hath vnto man / as vnto his chylde
more thā natural. In settyng out his
ꝓuidēce appered his īscrutable wisedome / 
magnificence / prudence, & policie
in his wonderfull order / wherin
were his creatures in their sondrye

degrees hygher or lower, as they
dydde participate in goodnes more
or lasse. In the toppe wherof aboue
a
                     •
                  l other, Man was sette nexte vnto
god, from whom order proceded.
               Moreouer by the sayde prouidence
hir was declared, that nothynge kep
                     •
                  nge
his place in order / shewed to
man by vnderstandynge / mought be
yll vnto hym, but alway profytable,
all though to the sences some thynges
dydde s
                     •
                  me to be yll and vnprofitable.
And laste of all it was proued
in a fewe sentences, that aduersite
was sent by god vnto a good mā,
nor iniustly or cruelly, but for a good

                  ion and louyngely / as of

and dignitie / by suche maner
of exercise proueth his vertue.
               ¶Nowe Aristippus reuoluyng all
this in thy mynde / whiche in a short

Epilogation I haue endeuoured my
selfe to reduce vnto thy remēbrance,
Consyder well bothe me and kynge
Dionise / as we were at that tyme,
whan we were togither. Thou knowest
well that from the tyme that I
was.xx.yeres old I alway cōtinued
disciple of Socrates, vntyll that he
dyed. Who (as thou knowist) the
answere of god determyned to be of
al mortall men the wysest. And that
whiche I lerned of hym was wysedome:
whiche as he euer affirmed
was included in these two wordes,
Knowe thy selfe. And by that doctrine
(as thou mayste remembre) he
abated the presumption of dyuers,
whiche supposed them selfe to be excellent
wyse men. Also reuoked many
that were dissolute and resolued
into vice, and made them to ensue
vertue. And by his exaumple of lyuynge
he prouoked men to contemne
fortune, and to haue onely vertue in

reuerence. And also therby, laste of
all, whan he was iniustely condemned
to deth he constantly and ioyfully
susteyned to haue the mortall body
dissolued / that the soule mought
be at reste and haue her immortal rewarde.
whiche exāple giuen of hym
was the corroboration of al his doctrine / 
and no lasse part of lerning vnto
his scolers, but rather moch more
than his oftē disputatiōs or lessons.
Imagine Aristippus, that I was so
studious and industrious aboute the
said lerninge / that I moste curiously
& (as I mought say) superstitiously
obseruid euery poynt of the said doctrine.
And that therfore all men in
Grece, and also kinge Dionyse had
conceyued of me an opinion, that I
was a wise man. And that the same
kynge sente for me, onely to that intent
(as I sayde at the begynnynge)
to see and here / whether I were accordinge
to his expectation.
               
                  
¶Consider also on the other parte,
that my cōming into Sicile / was narro
serue kinge Dionise, or to receyue
by hym any cōmoditie / but onely to
augmente wisedome by addition of
knowledge. And that he desired to
haue me with him for the cause that
I before haue rehersid. wherfore it
semith that he had nede of that, whiche
by seinge & hering of me / he trusted
to knowe, that is to saye wisedome.
For no man couayteth that
thynge, whiche he all redy hath / or
wherof in his owne opinion he hath
no nede. Now I knew partly by cō
                  mon
report / partly by thinformatiō
of Dion / which is a iuste man & an honest / 
that kinge Dionise was a Tyrāt,
that is to sai cōmen to that dignite bi
vsurpacion and violence, and not by
iuste succession or lefull election. Also
that he was a mā of quicke & subtile
wit, but therwith he was wonderfull
sensuall, vnstable, & wandring in

sondrye affections. Delytinge sometyme
in voluptuous pleasures, an other
tyme in gatheryng of great tresure
and rychesse, oftentymes resolued
into a bestly rage and vengeable
crueltie / Aboute the publicke weale
of his countraye alwaye remysse, in
his owne desyres studious and diligent.
And all this I perceyued very
well or I spake to hym any thynge.
Onely I exercised my selfe with the
Aristippus, Dion, and other, in suche
part of Philosophy as mought
induce you vnto the layd knowlege,
wherof I haue spoken, approuynge
alwaye my doctrine with the forme
of liuyng by the example of my maister
Socrates: Abydynge oportunitie
to speake, which mought ryse of
some speciall demande of kyng Dionise.
In the meane time to suche lyte
questions and problemes as he dyd
pourpose, concernynge naturall causes / 
Rhetorike / or poetry / or of the

dueties and maners of priuate persons / 
I resolued them so as he helde
hym contented / and delyted not a lytell
in the forme of my raysonyng.
               At the laste (as I haue tolde to the
at the begynnynge) he required me
to declare openly, the state and preeminence
of a kynge / whiche ruled
ouer other. Therat I reioyced, wenyng
to haue founde the oportunitie
to speake that I so longe loked for.
And than forthe with I consydered
that the sentence, whiche I shulde
pronounce, shulde eyther cōmende
and approue me for a wyse man / as
I was supposed to be: or els cōdēne
that opinion that kyng Dionise and
other had of me / as false and vntru,
I declarynge my selfe vnworthy to
haue it. I remembred also, that lyke
as ignorance and knowlege / or ylle
and good maye neuer accorde: no
more may falsehoode and truthe be
ioyned in one. And what so euer appereth

other wyse than it is in dede,
it is other thā truthe: and that whiche
is not truthe muste nedes be falshod.
More ouer as truthe is good / 
so falshod is yl. wherfore what so euer
is other thā truthe, can nat be in
a wise man, who by the consent of al
mē is good. Hauing styl in my mind
this cōsideratiō / I described a kinge,
not ꝑchāce as he wold haue had me / 
but as truth & the trust that he had ī
me cōpelled me. Therfore bi the said
knowlege, of the which we so longe
haue disputed / I set out & expressed
suche a man, in whom the soule had
intiere & ful auctorite ouer the sensis,
& alway kept the affectis in due rule
& obediēce, folowyng only the counsayle
of Vnderstāding, & by that gouernaunce
was moste like vnto god.
This man I called a kyng / although
he had no more in his possession thā
had Crates the Theban. And if that
suche one were by the free consent of

the people / chosen or receyued to be
a principal ruler and gouernour / gouerning
thē in like maner as he doth
him selfe, thā is he a gret king or Emperour / 
& to be had in reuerence & honor
aboue any mortal mā, sauyng to
god that excellēt honor, that is due
to the creator & first cause of al thīg.
Not only for the preeminēce giuē vnto
him bi a cōmun cōsent / but also for
as moch as by his knowlege / exāple / 
& authorite the people shal dayly receiue
of him an incōparable profite &
benefit / being allured & prouoked by
him to set their soules in the sayd astate
& authorite, as they mai also be
kīges, & be euer like vnto god. More
ouer this kynge by that knowledge
that he hath of hym self, he also knoweth
other men: for by the operatiō
whiche procedeth of their affectes / 
he perceyueth howe farre they be remoued
from their right place in the
lyne of order / that is to say, leauyng

knowlege and rayson / wherby they
were in the highest toppe of the lyne / 
they descende to the places of brute
beastes by participatyng with them
in sensuall appetites. And than wyll
he endeuour hym selfe by all good
meanes to restore them agayne (if
he maye) to theyr propre place in
Ordre.
               ¶Also suche a kynge stablysshed in
the sayde knowledge, can neuer be
deceyued by his moste pernicious or
mischeuous ennemyes / whiche be
flatterers and glosers, by whome
princis be deuoured alyue / and their
soules vtterly consumed with moste
mortall pestilence, wherwith their
coūtreis and people be also in perile
to be loste & destroyed. For as sone
as either in their coūsailes / or in their
praises & dispreises / or in their owne
order of liuing / he by the said knowlege
perceyueth and noteth / to what
affectis they be īclined, he awaytith

them / and by auoydinge their companie
eskapeth their snares.
               ¶Finally to the intente that the excellencie
of suche a kynge shulde be
more euident / like as I dyd sette out
while ere knowlege by Ignoraunce
(for euery thinge sheweth moste perfectly,
and after the cōmon prouerbe
of marchantis, best to the sale, whā

any man experte in the sayde knowlege / 
of a syncere loue that he bereth

               ¶This description kynge Dionyse
mought not abyde to here, but thinkynge
the tyme loste that I hadde
spente for his profyte, sayde that
these were but wordes of ydell dotardes / 
wherby hir semeth that he
vnderstode not my wordes / for if he
hadde, he wolde haue thanked me,

desyred to here / that is to say wysedom /

consysteth in knowledge. Or elles
he required some acte of me to be

                  hewed, whiche agreinge with my
wordes shulde approue me to be a
wise mā, acording to his first opiniō.

Howe sayst thou, was it not for one
of these causes, that he spake those
wordes vnto me?

               Yes in good

               We were agreed while ere, that he
had nede of me, whanne he sent for
me, and therfore he desyred to se me
and to speake with me: but whan
I was with hym / although I endeuored
my selfe to satisfy hym of that
which he had nede of / & so moch desired / 
yet if he did not vnderstād what
I sayd, in dede my wordes were in

                  le. I put case Aristippus / that one
of the philosophers of Inde or of other
countrayes speakynge no greke
had come vnto him / whom he wold
haue required by an interpretour to
haue taught hym wysedome, howe
shulde he haue instructed kynge Dionise
to haue satisfied his gentyl desyre?

               Howe els but by an Interpretour.

               What yf zeno
Eleates after that he had byt of his

owne tongue, and spyt it in the face
of the tyrant that tourmented him,
had bene sente for to kynge Dionise,

               AR.
               I knowe

               Yes / he mought do
it sooner by wrytyng.

               Ye that
is truth. But I ment the answering
his demande without any tarying.

               Yet than perchance, he shuld
also haue nede of an interpretoure,
that knewe his tokens, leste kynge
Dionyse, whiche had not bene vsed
vnto them, shulde not vnderstonde
what he ment by them. But supposest
thou Aristip. that any man can
better īterprete an other mās sentēce / 
eyther spoken in a strange language,

or signified by tokens, than I coulde
expounde myne owne intent or meanynge:

               Nay surely. For euery

               And if it be expouned

               Ye that is sure.
            
            
               PL.
               Mought I haue
vsed any playner and shorter waye / 
than in fewer wordes than king Dionise
reproued me with to remembre
him
                     •
                   that in his owne wordis he
mought deprehende that thing that
he soughte for / sens that whiche I
spake before was in his owne language,
and therfore he vnderstode
the wordes sufficiently? and if there
were ani thing which he vnderstode
not, it was in the sentence.
            
            
               ARIS.
               What meanest thou therby?
            
            
               PLA.
               Mary I wyll telle the. In the definition
of a kynge I instructed hym
howe he mought be in the hygheste
dignitie nexte vnto god / and also in

mooste perfecte suretie, whiche was
no smalle benefite of so poore a persone
as I am to gyue to a prince.
               Wherfore if the eyen of kynge Dionyse
soule, Knowledge and Rayson,
had not ben out, he shulde sone haue
perceiued the sayd benefite, and like
a noble manne haue gyuen to me
thankes, whiche I well deserued.
And in the description of a Tyraunt
I warned hym of al dangers / wherby
he mought lose the sayd dignitie.
In the which two declaratiōs was
holly comprehended all that / for the
whiche he so moch desyred to se me.
And all this whyle I knewe not,
but that he had ben a good manne,
bycause he desyred to knowe that / 
whiche thou haste granted is good,
that is to saye / wysedome. Nowe
whan he gaue not to me condigne
thākes, as my benefite deserued, but
accōpted me to haue bē idle, whiles
I instructed him, than it semed / that

Vnderstāding was absēt & fled from
the soule, & that he rulid not as a kīg
but that he was rulid bi his affectiōs:
Wherfore his ingratitude declared
his wordes to sauour of tirāny: whiche
I rehersed vnto him to thintent
that he perceyuynge by my wordes
in what perylle he was in / mought
by the remembrynge of my fyrste instruction
concernyng a kyng, reuoke

                     〈◊〉
                   vnderstandynge, and subduynge

                  tesones restored
vnto his dignitie. Howe sayste
thou, consyderynge well all that,
whiche is before sayde, were my
wordes ylle as they were spoken?
            
            
               AR.
               Nay, as thou haste declared
them, but yet me semeth they were
very sharpe.
            
            
               PL.
               wotest thou what
makethe the to thynke so? bycause
they were shorte. But thou muste
consider, that he that lacketh, in that

                     〈◊〉
                   he doeth lacke / he is inferior
to him of whom he desireth it / wherfore

in as moche as kyng Dionyse to
haue benefite of me, became my herer / 
he was inferior vnto me. And
therfore respecte ought to be alway
hadde to that, whervnto the raison
extendeth, and nat to the astate of
the persone that hereth. And that I
alwaye consydered. And therfore
spake I as I dyd to kynge Dionise.
Yet did I it with suche a temperāce / 
that if he had not bene a Tyraunt in
dede / he wolde neuer haue bene discontented.
For I dyd not calle hym
a tyrant or reproched him of any tyranny:
But only sayd that his wordes
sauored of tyranny.
               ¶I put the case thou gauest to me
wyne oute of a vessell / and whan I
had dronke of it, I wolde say that it
had a sent of mustynes / it argueth
not that the vessell in musty. For perchance
within fyue or sixe days that
sent wyll be gone, & the wyne wyll
drynke clene and gentilly. And therfore

I suppose for my wordes thou
woldest not be angry. What if that
kynge Dionise had desired me to teche
hym Rhetorike: And whan I
herde hym declame, or saw his writyng,
If I fyndinge any faute in his
wordes wolde warne hym in this
wyse. Syr your wordes do fauour
of to moche arrogance, or that they
sauored of sewet and payntinge, or
be lyke vnto apples of the deed so / 
which be delicate in colour without
but within ther is nothing but coles
and powder vnsauery. Reuokynge
hym therby to suche rules as I had
before radde vnto hym, wherby yf
he wold be diligent, he shuld bringe
the forme of speakynge and writing
into a perfection. Supposist thou / 
that this maner of instruction shulde
prouoke kynge Dionyse to be angry
with me?

               No,
For hir were no rayson.

               Than hath he not so sharpe a wytte

as thou haste supposed, sens he
perceyuethe not, howe moche the
lernynge of wysedome, excedeth the
lernynge of Rhethorike. And therfore
he that techeth wysdom ought
to be of a greater auctoritie, than he
which techeth Rhetorike. And therfore
sens thou doest cōfesse that king
Dionyse in lernyng Rhetorike wold
take in good worth / what so euer I
wolde say, in correctyng his wordes
concernynge eloquence: Howe moche
more ought he thanne to take in
good ꝑte those wordis that I spake,
in correctynge his wordes, wherby
he semed to refuse wysdom / whiche
a lytle before he so moche couaited to
here declarid? And one thīg mought
haue cōtēted him: that al that I had
spokē was at his desire & for his cō
                  modite.
Where if I had purposed to
haue gotten any thinge by hym, my
wytte was not so sengle, but that
I knewe howe to speke wordes as

well as thou, whiche shulde delyte
hym. But whan he demed me to be
a wyse man, he with that opinion
bounde me that I coude not deceiue
hym.

               Thou hast not denied hitherto,

               Naye in good
fayth. For me semeth that thy description
of a kynge was wonderful
true and necessarye, and also therin
was the knowledge, wherof thou
haste treated compendiously / and
playnely declared. And me thinketh
that the wordis that kynge Dionise
spake, besemed not a kyng, but were
moch rather the wordes of one that
lacked that knowledge, wherin is
wysdome.

               Nowe I am
glad Aristippus, that I fynde in the
so moche conformitie in raison. Thā
sens these vngentyll wordes of kyng
Dionise besemed not a kyng to speke
it appereth that they besemed hym
that was contrary vnto a king / whiche
is a Tyrant. And being the wordes
of one that lacked knowlege / it
accordethe also that they were the
wordes of one that was ignoraunt / 
and Ignoraunce is mooste contrarye
to wysedome / and as I haue

saide trāsformeth a man into a beast
or a monstre. But what ignorance is
it / that thou supposiste by the sayde
wordes was declared to be in kinge
Dionise?
            
            
               AR.

               what a Tyrant
Aristippus? thou spekest nowe
more playnely than I dyd. God for
bede that I shulde suffre so gentyll a
prince to be transformed in to suche
a monstre / if I coude helpe him. But
I praye the / whiche benefite woldist
thou preferre / either that whiche is
giuen or employd furthwith / or that
whiche is lenger differred?
            
            
               ARIS.
               what question is that? That kindenesse

               Than if furthwith &

as sone as I perceyued the transformation
of gentyll kynge Dionyse, I
endeuored my selfe to make hym to
knowe by his owne wordes what
he was, whereby if he wolde, he
mought by the expellynge of Ignorance
haue ben not only restored vnto
the forme of a man: but also haue
bene made a great Emperour by the
well vsynge of his dignitie. Supposest
not thou that I dydde as it be
came me? and for that benefite soo
soone offred, was I not worthy a
great gramercy?
            
            
               AR.
               Yes if he wold
haue so taken it. But or thou camest
to hym, thou kneweste by credible
reporte, that he was obstinately inclyned
to all vicious affections / and
therwith impatient and cruel, wherfore
whanne thou dyddest perceyue
that he contemned thi doctrine, thou
shuldest than haue ceassed / and not
haue offred thy selfe to peryle without
hope of benefite.

               That aduantage

onely thou hast of me Aristippus:
for thou that doest professe
pleasure, moughtest haue done so lefully,
but I that haue professed wisedome
& vertue mought by no menes
haue done it. For if I hadde not re
                  
                     〈…〉

                     〈◊〉
                   declared, whiche he required to

                     〈◊〉

                     〈…〉
                  ,
as by an example in other artis
or se
                     〈…〉
                  ces was playnly set out and
expressed. And like wise as I knewe
that he was impacient and cruell.
               So more certeynely I knewe that
he had no power to indamage my
soule, by whose operation I was
called a wyle man. And if I shulde
haue holden my peace than, it shuld
haue ben for feare of damage, whiche
mought happen by his impacience
and crueltie towarde my body,
than shulde I haue proued my selfe
to haue ben a foole and no wyse mā / 
that I had not holden my peace at

the begynnynge / and thanne shulde
kynge Dionise haue founde no cause
to haue taken displeasure. But sens
he desyred to know, if I were a wise
manne, and for that opinion that he
had in me / he fauored me, and also
thou doest confesse that my description
of a kynge by his definition / and
also by comparyng hym to his contrarye / 
conteyned that knowledge,
wherin is wysedome: nowe remained
nothyng but operation to proue
me to be a wyse man. Wherfore cō
                  temnynge
or lyttell regardynge that
vayne feare, to bryng kinge Dionise
to knowlege, whiche he desyred / declared
that my mynde was not subiecte
to corporall passions, and consequently
not to sensuall affections,
which mought haue incensed or stered
me to speake that thynge that
mought haue pleased kyng Dionyse
appetite, whiche was corrupte and
vicious, hopyng to haue had therby

preferment and singuler fauour: and
herein began the operation whiche
agreed with my sayde knowledge.
And afterwarde by takyng libertie
from me, and makyng me a slaue, he
more declared mi wordis to be true,
and therby had the larger example,
wherby he mought the better haue
knowen hym selfe. And after whan
he herde (as I doubt not but that he
hath) howe constantly I contemned
the peryle that I was in / of my lyfe
at Egina: he mought well perceyue
that operation in pacience to agree
with my knowlege. And therby he
had fully all that knowledge of me,
wherfore he desired to se me. where
contrarywise, if I shuld haue holdē
my peace, as well my commynge to
kynge Dionise had ben frustrate and
vayne, and his gentylle desyre had
ben vnsatisfied, as also by my silence
beinge thought (as raison was that
I shulde be) to be subdued eyther

with fere or affectiō: I shuld seme to
condemne min owne doctrine, wherfore
I shuld be demid vnworthi that
good opiniō, that kyng Dionise had
of me.

               Wel Plato in such experience
of wysdome I wyl not folow
the.
            
            
               PL.
               Therfore whan any aduersitie
shall happen vnto the, as I suppose
thou haste not fortune locked
faste in a cof
                     •
                  er no more than hadde
Cresus the riche kynge of Lidia / for
all that he thought that all goddes
and men were his frendes, and yet
was he openly bourned by Cyrus,
whom he litle fered, Thou shalt fele
both aduersitie & grefe, & also make
thy soule subiecte vnto thy sences,
wherof what doth folow, thou dost
yet remembre what we haue alredy
discussed. Where I or any other by
the said knowlege & operation thervnto
ioyned, shalbe so armed agayn
aduersitie, that what so euer the body
feleth, yet the very man which is

the soule fealeth no disease / or as I
mought say is neuer inquieted, but
is euer intiere and in his true proportion
and figure: that is to say like vnto
god. And also shall haue the price
that he hath deserued, by vanquysshynge
of his aduersarye, that is to
saye corporall disease or aduersitie.
               But nowe Aristippus / sens by any
thynge that hath happened I neuer
fell from that place in the lyne of order / 
wherin god had set me, but my
mynde was euer in one state and cō
                  dicion / 
& there as it was at my comming
into Sicile / there it hath hitherto
euer continued, mayst thou raisonably
say, that I was euer lost / in so
moche as I was neuer transformed
or out of that astate, where in a wise
man ought alway to be?
            
            
               ARI.
               No
in good faith as it now semeth.
            
            
               PL.
               What sayst thou than by king Dionise?
Whome instructinge to knowe
him selfe I thus moche displeased, &

in stede of thanke and prefermente
hathe rewarded me with daunger
and bondage?
            
            
               ARI.
               On my faythe
I thinke that he hath bothe lost him
selfe / by refusynge the sayde knowlege / 
wherby he shulde haue ben delyuered
from the sayde transformation,
and also he hath moste folishly
lost the Plato, in puttynge the from
him, which by thy counsaile shuldist
haue ben to hym so royall a tresure,
and the same do I thinke also of Polides
the ambassador, & of the Egenites.
            
            
               PLA.
               Gramercy Aristippus for
thy gentylle audience: nowe be we
come to the towne / and haue made
a good ende bothe of our iournaye
and also of oure communication.
            
            
               AR.
               Farewell Plato, and for my
parte I wolde not haue lacked it for
the horse that I ryde on. And to say
the truth it hath made me to change
some what of myn olde opinion.
            
            
               PLATO.

                     •
                  ete I wyl make the to change all / if
thou wylt here and abide rayson.
