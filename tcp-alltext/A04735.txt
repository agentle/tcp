            To a pleasant new tune.
            
               
            
            
               
            
            
               AS it fell vpon a day,
               in the merry moneth of may:
               Sitting in a pleasant shade,
               with a gowne of mertle made?
               Beasts did leape and birds did sing,
               trées they grow and plants they spring▪
               
            
            
               Euery bird sings bannish mone,
               saue the Nightingale alone:
               She poore bird as all forlorne
               leanes her breast vnto a thorne:
               Where she sung this mournefull ditty,
               that to héere it twas great pitty:
            
            
               Fie, fie, fie, now can she cry.

                  -by and by:
               For to heare her thus complaine.
               scarse from teares I could refraine,
               For her griefe so liuely showne,
               makes me thinke vpon my owne.
            
            
               O thought I thou monest in vaine,
               none takes pitty of thy paine:
               Senselesse trées they cannot héere thée:
               retchles birds they will not chéere thée,
               King anoy he is dead,
               and all thy friends are clad in lead,
            
            
               All thy fellow birds do sing,
               carelesse of thy sorrowing:
               While that fickle fortune smiled,
               thou and I were both beguiled:
               Euery one that flatters thée,
               is no

                  iend in misery,
            
            
               When that I was prodigall,
               bountifull they did me call:
               And with such flattering,
               pitty but I were a King,
               But when fortune chanced to frowne,
               then farewell thy high renown,
            
            
               He is thy friend and friend in deed,
               that stickes to thee in time of néed,
               When thou sorrowest he will weepe:
               when thou wakest he will not sleepe,
               Thus with euery grefe in heart,
               he with thée will beare a part.
            
            
               First entised by many wiles,
               and by fortunes fickle smiles:
               Griefe it is my chéefest song,
               sorrow to me doth belong,
               Still I waite and moane to see,
               my hard hap and misery.
            
            
               When all my money it was spent,
               no credit vnto me be lent:
               But straight they turnd me out of doore,
               to beg my bread among the poore.
               Thus fortune first on me did smile,
               and afterwards did me beguile,
            
            
               Wherefore I wish all youthes that see,
               to take war
