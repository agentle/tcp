            ¶TO THE READER.
            
               
                  FOR SO MVCHE AS
(gentle Reader) Man
is not born to ye onely
profite, and pleasuring
of him self alone
(as witnesseth TVLLIE.) But
parte of his birth, his Countrey
doth challeng: part his parents,
and part his frendes? I thought
good therfore, to offer vnto thy
attentiue and benevolent eares,
this present Historie: Wherin
thou maist see, the puissant force
of ragyng loue, and the mutabylytie,
and fickle state of Fortune:
And so muche the rather, I haue
yelded this Historie into thy hā
               des,
for y• it is affirmed, of graue
and ancient Fathers, that a Historie
is to be esteemed & accompted,
as a moste cleare Glasse, for

imitacion, of ordering, and institution
of mannes life. Both to
yong men, that by reading of diuerse
things, are made equall in
wisdome, to their Elders: And
also to Aūcientes, whose cōtinuance
of time ministreth experience
of many matters. Moreouer,
that it maketh priuate
men, worthye of honour: forceth

                  •
               lowte, and valiant Captaynes,
(for emulation of glorie▪) to accomplish
inuincible exploites:
            Encourageth Sowldiers to be
more prompt, and redy (for desire
of praise whiche neuer dieth) to
hazarde lyfe for the sauegarde of
their Countrey. And is a terrour
to wicked men to offend, for feare
of Infamie and reproche. For a
Historie is a Treasorer of Ualiaunce,
and a witnesse against yll
doers. I craue not of thee any

hyre for my paynes (gentell Reader)
but friendly acceptance, and
that thou would stoppe with an
Iron Barre, and Bolte of Brasse
the 
                  •
               elchyng Nosethrils of RHINOCEROS
subtyll Snowte, and
his raging▪ furious 
                  •
               o wling, cō
               pesce,
and mitigate with perpended
Iudgement. And lastly, that
thy friendly worde, breathyng &
blowyng▪ a coole, & gentle blaste,
of Golden Ayre, maye happelie
yeld, vnto my first fruits, a calme
and fauourable winde.
            Fare ye well.

            ¶The Argument.
            LOe héere, the fierie force of loue,
            redéemes the worthy wit,
            From seruile yoake: beinge drownde in sincke
            and stinkyng muddie pytie.
            Beholde how Reason yeldes to loue,
            and Uertue geueth place:
            The Ruler, blinded by desire,
            his noble fame deface.
            And sée how wauering Fortune turnes,
            with euery blast of winde:
            First, gentle face, then frowning f
                  •
               ets,
            she cast
                  •
                on longyng minde.
            From lowryng lookes, to smilyng chéers
            she eftsoones flittes againe:
            The lingring louer thus shée féedes,
            with hope his loue to gaine.
            And then from top of whirlyng whéele,
            she throwes him in the suddes:
            The captiue thence to raunsome then,
            with aide in haste she scuddes.
            And graunts at length his wisshed pray
            and onely hartes delight:
            Which he enioyed against the force,
            of forreine foes despight.
         
      
      
         
            
            A pleasant and
most delightful Historie, of
GALESVS, CYMON, and
IPHIGENIA.

               Amonst the Auncient Chronicles,
               and Monumentes of praise.
               This Historie, so rare to heare,
               as pleasant to be read:
               Of such as can with skyll peruse
               the same, with iudgyng head.
            
            
               THere whilom was a noble man,
               that ARISTIPPVS hight:
               Whom Fortune deckt wt worldly giftes
               aboue eche other wight.
               So that, both tearmed well, he might
               and iustly happie bée:
               If his good hap not clouded were
               with Fortunes Tirrannie.

                  emlynes of stature, eke
               dyd others farre excell.
               For all these giftes of nature, yet
               a meycocke wretch, was he:
               Whose name, his Parents first assig

               But sithe, he neither could conceiue,
               by Tutours learned mouthe:

               nor Muses skyll in youth

               Ne yet his fathers, graue Aduise,
               nor industrie of guide:
               Could make him leade a Courtiers lyfe
               or from his

                  olie slide.
               And (for his speache was grosse, & thick
                     •
                  
               
               and he enclined more
               To beastly, rude behauiour, then
               to ciuyll Courtly lore.)
               He was of all men (SIMON) call
                     •
                  e,
               in iest, in sporte and game:
               Which word inferth, in Cyprian tongue
               a vyle, reprochefull name.
               And when his idle sluggish life,
               was griefe, to fathers harte,
               And of redresse, he saw all hope▪
               
               was plainly laide aparte.
               And fearyng, least he should be vexte
               with dayly present woe:
               
                  Sent CYMON, to vplandysh soyle,
               farre from his sight to goe.
               And Husbandrie to practise there.
               amongste the Clownish sorte:
               Of suche as delue, wt Spade & Sholue,
               not lyke to Cytie sporte:
               Whiche thing, delighted Cymons heart
               (for one so rude▪ as he,
               Do ioye in Swinish maners more
               then in Cyuilitie.)
            
            
               WHylste he therfore, in Countrey toile
               and trauayle spendes the day:
               In tearyng vp with tusked Ploughe,
               the Lande, (that doth repay
               Twice toulde, and yearely, treble gain)
               his minde he doth conuerte:
               In lieu of liberall Sciences,
               of Tilthe to learne the Arte.
               It chaunc'de therfore vpon a daye,
               at after noone, as hée
               Was walkynge, through his Fathers fields
               his Meades, & Groues to see.
               Alone with walkynge staffe in hande
               he entred in a wood:
               But small: yet passyng swéete of all,
               that in the Countrey stoode.
               And (for it was the Month of May)
               and temperate pleasant Ayre:
               
                  Beyng clothd wt gréene delightful boughes
               it séemde to CYMON faire.
               Where vainly stalkyng vp and downe,
               with gazing héere and there:
               To view the pleasure, of the place,
               (Fortune his guide) came néere:
               And foote by foote, he passed through,
               a little Meadow Plotte:
               Which hugie Trées, with loftie toppes,
               had compast, as a Moate.
               And through the place, a Riuer ranne,
               whose springyng Siluer Streames
               Did flow with coole, & glisteryng ebbes,
               against sir PHEBVS Beames.
               Not farre from which, vpon the grasse
               he viewd, with fixed eye:
               A Uirgyn there, surprisde with sléepe,
               of Beautie great, to lie.
               The Garment, wherwith she was clad,
               was thinne, and shonne so bright,
               That almost no parte, of her Corps,
               was hid from CYMONS sight.
               And she was girtte, below the waste,
               with Lynnen, white as Skies:
               Nigh her two handmaides, tooke their rest
               an Eunuche, slept likewise.
               When Cymon first, this Uirgyn viewd
               amazde, be stoode in minde:
               Lyke as if he, in all his dayes,
               had not séene Womankinde.
               
                  And leanyng on his knaggy Staffe,
               beholdes her Courtly grace:
               And speachlesse restes, and marketh wel
               the Beautie of her face.
               With diligence he prieth aboute,
               with neuer winkyng eye:
               Tyll all proporcions of her face,

                  e dyd directly spie.
               Then foorthwith, in his sencelesse head,
               and grosse polluted minde:

               could pearce, before this tyme.)
               This new deuise, is risen now,
               this thought, his fancie clime:
               Which musing, he in blockish braine,
               to reason thus began:
               And beyng brutish as he was,
               in troubled head, dyd scan
               The fulgent brightnesse of her face,
               and (oh what thing,) said hée,
               Is equipollent, in this worlde
               to her

               her amiable looke:
               And view'd the Uirgyns séemelinesse,
               in lieu of Psalter Booke.
               And noated all her lineamentes,
               of perfecte forme and shape:
               
                  And praised greatly in his heart,
               in Natures Arte, hir happe
               And first her He

                  e, like goulden wyre,

               And fully was resolued in minde,
               they shonne as PHEBVS rayes.
               And then her forehead, nose, & mouthe,
               her necke, her Armes and breast:
               To laude in heart, and muse theron
               in mynde, he neuer ceaste.
               Thus he, a rude, vplandish man,
               in twincklyng of an eye:
               Is now become of Beautie Iudge,
               to scan of Phisnomie.
               His greatest care, was now to sée,
               her splendent glisteryng eye:
               Whiche drownde with sléepe & drowsie dreames
               fast closde wt lids, did lie.
               Whiche, (CYMON) that he might beholde
               was minded to awake:
               From sléepe, this Damsell bright yt hee
               the view therof might take.
               But sithe she fairest séemde of all
               that earst he sawe with eye:
               He gan to feare, leaste that she were
               a Goddesse in the Skie.
               And (for he was so blunt of witte,
               that well he did not know:
               If heauenly things, more worthy were
               then thinges on earth that grow.
               
                  Therfore somwhat, he brideled lust,
               and staide a time to sée,
               If that her eyes, of owne frée wyll
               would wake, or opened bée.
               And though this pawsinge séemed long,
               and griefe it was, to staye
               Unwonted pleasure, heald his hearte
               from partyng yet awaye:
               Thus CYMON gazyng styll, and yet
               enioyng lybertie
               To gaze: out of her sléepe, behould
               she walk

                  th by and by.
               Her name hight IPHIGENIA,
               
               (so Parentes did deuise:)
               Whiche, when she lifted vp her head,
               and opened wide her eyes:
               And CYMON leanyng on his staffe,
               before her stande, she see:
               Amazde in minde, these wordes, or lyke
               to hym then vttered shée.
               (For Cyprians, knew their CYMON well,
               for his simplicitie:
               And partly for his Fathers wealthe,
               and great Nobylytie.)
               What séekste thou CYMON in this wood,

               But Answere CYMON rendred none

                  t his staryng eyes, on hers,
               not lookyng once away.
               For sure (he thought) a passyng smell,

               And yet that moste procur'd his griefe,

               the roote of griefe to grow:
               His Brayne was eke, besiegde wt care,
               what wayes he might deuise:
               To conquere hate: and gaine the loue,
               of hir, that bleard his eyes.
               Thus musing now in minde, he standes
               in studie colde as Ice:
               And styll deuising how he may
               atchiue his enterprise.

               to looke for better grace.
               And tumbled now, on carefull couche,
               in Countrey Cabyn lay:
               Inuentyng seuerall wayes, now this,
               now that, he did assay.
               But (sundrie consultacions passde,)
               in ende, he dyd conclude:
               To liue exilde from Countrey soyle,
               (for Countrey Clownes are rude.)
               Therfore, to Courte in haste, he hyes
               hym, to his Fathers howse:
               And stoutely to his Parentes sweares
               that he wyll hould the Plowes
               No longer now, or digge, and delue,
               and be a Countrey Slaue:
               But loathyng Countrey life, begyns,

               and treble, wonted woe:
               His Friends, and Kinsmens griefe likewise
               began agayne to grow.
               Yet purposde they, a while to stay,
               the perfecte cause, to know:
               Of sodeyne chang, that forc'de this man

               When CYMONS, sense was rauished
               with IPHIGENIAES face.
               Whose pulchritude of liuely looke,
               his glimpse of eye, did daze.)
               He, was not he, but chang'd his coate,
               his maners he began
               To change likewise, and was be come
               from thence, an altred man.
               This chang, to Courtiers séemed strang
               a wonder, to his féeres:
               An admiration, to his kinne,
               a ioy to fathers yeares.
               Then of his Father, first he crau'd,
               to be apparaild braue:

               His Father graunted his request,

               The cause, of all this sodeyne change,
               was IHPHIGENIAS loue:
               Whiche made him banish lobbish lyfe,

               The Bridegrome sent, to fetch the Bride
               with gladsome merie chéere:
               All this, when CYMON had reuolu'd
               and pondred in his brest:
               
                  The time approcheth now, thought hée,
               to purchase quiet rest.
               Yf euer, now: he mindes to shewe
               to IPHIGENIA:
               
               The scorchyng heate, of broylynge loue,
               that in his brest did staye.
               And now with diligence, to prooue
               his vowed Loyaltie:
               With mightie hande, for to withstande,
               her partynge from his eye.
               For thée, (he said) I frie and swelt,
               in Fornace, of desire:
               For of a Beaste, to manly shape
               thou madste mée to aspire.
               Yf that the Gods wyll graunte, that I
               to wyfe, may thee enioye:
               And thy Societie, to embrace,
               that shall my cares destroye.
               And doubtlesse, would I thinke in ioye▪
               
               to passe my goulden yeares:
               And for to leade an Angelles lyfe,
               amongst the Princelie Péeres,
               And certes, Death shall ende my dayes,
               with dint of bloudie knife:
               But I, in spite of hatefull foes,
               wyll winne thee to my wyfe.
               He (reasonyng thus, in troubled brayne,)
               his friendes by stealth dyd call:

               to know what should befal.)
               
                  To priuate counsell, whiche he helde,
               and opened there his minde:
               To them, & what he woulde haue done,
               he leaueth not behinde.
               A Ship, then closely, he prepares,
               and deckes with furniture:
               Méete for the warre by Sea: and longe
               against his foes, to dure.
               Whiche vittailde well, and armed then
               he enters in the Ship.
               And cuttes the Seas, and sayle, & sterne,
