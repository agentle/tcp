wearie expectation of their vaine hope, which
is nowe turned to deſpaire, the Duke himſelfe
being withdrawen to Bruxils.
            Alſo it is moſt certaine, that the Kings maieſties
forces doe foorthwith come downe into
Normandie, to reduce thoſe places which ſtand
for the diſloiall Leaguers. His Maieſtie meaning
to beginne at thoſe little Townes which
ſtand betweene Roane and New-hauen, from
whence no ſuccour can come vnto Roane, as
they haue expected.
            Alſo, thoſe of Roane ſince the defeate of the
Duke of Parmaes forces, haue beene at Diep,
and required to haue libertie for all thoſe women and
children that are vnder the age of
ſixteene yeexes, whoſe parents and huſbandes
were withdrawen into places of force, leauing
theyr dwellinges deſolate, to retourne to theyr poſ

            Laſtly and briefly, there is great lykelyhood
that the kings Maieſtie will ſhortlye chaſe and
driue awaie all his enimies, and not ſeeke, as
they haue preſumptuouſlie boaſted, to conclude
anie peace with them. But when wee do conſider
the aſſured reſolution of the kings maieſtie,
builded vppon a firme perſeuerance in vndoubted
faith, his right, and the neuer chaunging
promiſe of Almightie God, who hath promiſed
to race out the remembraunce of ſuch as lay
violent handes on his annointed. Wee haue
no doubt, but dare boldly affirme, & will hourely
expect the dounfall of thoſe degenerate monſters,
who hauing builded on the weake ſand of
mans power and inuention, ſhal not bee able to
indure the breath of the Lordes wrath, but bee
ſwallowed with Corah in the ſwelling ſurges
of theyr owne abhominations, and theyr Arch-counſellers
the rewarde of Achitophell: theyr
ring-leader the ende of Abſolom: which the
Lord at his good will and pleaſure will bring to
paſſe.
