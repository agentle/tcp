                  And I say that good reason agreth to it

                     The sone that is wyse shuld neuer the more
                  Lose hys land or auctoryte therfore

                  Grete landys or possessyons doth attayn
                  Hys owne lyfe is to shorte & to lyte
                  For to take the frute of his meryte
                  Reason wolde therfore that after hys lyfe
                  Hys heyrs before straungers haue p̄rogatyfe

                  Then to speke by reason grete possessions
                  Make no gentylmen but gentyl condycyons
                  That is the cause and best reason why
                  One shuld be callyd a gentylman truly
                  And forthermor mark well this reason then

                  Long after ther were but few people than

                  Some gafe them self all to Idylnes
                  And wold not labour but take by vyolence

                  Them ꝑt of theyr gettingꝭ in peas of lyfe
                  Or ellꝭ for theyr landis money a porcyon
                  So possessyons began by extorcyon

                  The labouryng people than they ordeynyd
                  And made laws meruelous strayte & hard
                  That theyr heyrꝭ myght inioy it afterward
                  So the law of inhetyaunce was furst begon

                  Able to defend the land when nede is

                  But such men as haue gret rentꝭ and landꝭ
                  And no estate but terme of theyr lyuys
                  And euery thyng theron wyll norysh and saue
                  For the grete zele & loue that they only haue
                  To the cōmyn welth of theyr contrey

                  That be worthy to haue possessyons
                  And such people of vertuouse condycyons

                  For the cōmyn welth thys is good reason playn
                  So that noman owght to haue any land
                  But such as be apt and haue charge in hand
                  For the cōmyn welth as pryncys and rulers
                  Bysshoppꝭ curatꝭ prechers and techers
                  Iugges mynysters and other offycers
                  That of the cōmyn welth be executers

                  Such men as be apt to all such thyngꝭ
                  Shuld haue landꝭ to mayntayne theyr lyffyngꝭ
                  So enherytaunce is not besemynge
                  To let them haue landꝭ that cā do no such thing
                  Nor I thynk it not resonable nother
                  One man to lyf by labour of an nother
                  For ych man is borne to labour truly
                  As a byrde is to fle naturally
                  Nor a man ought not to haue such lyberte
                  To lefe landꝭ to hys chyld wher by that he

                  There is alway good remedy for that
                  That is to compell them to do som what
                  So that ych man hauyng enherytaunce
                  Haue some auctoryce and gouernaunce
                  wherein he shulde take payne and besynes

                  P
                  Then thys grete myschef shuld folow of hit
                  Oft tymes they shuld rule that haue lyttyll wyt
                  Or disposyd to be proud & couetous
                  Or to lyfe after theyr lustis voluptuous

                  For the mayntenaunce of hys oppynyon
                  yet he hys desseuyd for all hys reason
                  For it is necessary that rulers be
                  To haue posseyons to mayntayn theyr degre
                  And those few to dryfe the multytude all
                  of the other people to labour to fall
                  For yf the rulers drof them not therto
                  The peple wold be ydyll & nothyng doo
                  
                     And most reason is that gouernaunce
                  Shuld come to such rulers by inherytaunce
                  Rather than to haue them chose by eleccyon
                  Oft tymys by drede mede and affeccyon
                  Men of euyll conscyens that grete tyraunts be
                  Rede old cronyclys the proue ye shall see
                  And though they haue grete wyt and lernyng
                  Yet so proud they be therof they fere nothyng
                  Nother god nor man but euermore styll
                  wt out councell or aduyse folow theyr own wyll
                  But they that by inherytaunce rulers be
                  Though they haue no grete lernyng yet we see
                  yet makyth them more ferefull & better cōtent
                  To folow wyse mens councell and aduysement
                  And syth that yt hath ben so long cōtynned
                  Enherytours to haue rule and so long usyd
                  And that they haue ruled by as dyscressyon
                  As the other that haue be chose by eleccyon
                  If that order of rule by successyon of blode
                  Shuld be dystroyd it shuld doo hurte & no good

                  That reason is so grete no man can debarr

                  K
                  And therin he lyeth for by expiens we see
                  That gentyl cōdycyons most com̄enly be
                  In them that be of noble blode borne
                  For take .xx. carters whych neuer were beforne
                  Aquayntyd let them be to gyder
                  Take .xx. straynge gentylmen in lyke maner
                  These churlysh carters I dare well say
                  wyll not agre to gyder skant one day
                  wt out chydyng quarrellyng or fyghtyng
                  ychone wyll stele from other and be pykyng
                  And stryfe whych of them at the skot shall pay lest
                  And indeuer them who can play the knaue best
                  But these gentylmen I warant you wyll study
                  who can shew to other most curtesy
                  And of theyr gentylnes wyll pfer to pay
                  For the other and shew what pleasurs they may
                  So touchyng gentylnes I say surely
                  Men of grete byrth vse it most com̄ynly
               
               
                  M
                  There can be no truer saying nor sentence
                  And the cause therof we see by expience
                  
                     For these pore wretches that haue no thyng
                  Must be nygardys churlyth and spayryng
                  But gentylmen be taught to be lyberall
                  And so they may be for they haue where wt all
               
               
                  K
                  And as touchyng noblenes that argument
                  whych the plowman made late puyth euydent
                  That gentylmen borne to land must nedys be
                  For suffyency of most nobylyte
                  For besyde goddys gyfts of grace & of nature
                  As wyt and bodely stryngh yet they be sure
                  Of other ryches as of land and rent
                  To auoyd nede so they be more suffycyent
                  of them self than other pore people doutles
                  Then yf nede of straunge helpe cause wrechydnes
                  And suffysauns be cause wrechydnes
               
               
                  M
                  A better reason no man can deuyse
                  And yet farther I thynk lykewyse
                  He that hath grete haboundance of ryches
                  May vse lyberalyte and gentylnes
                  And also it is euer necessary
                  That some lyfe in welth and some in mysery
                  And let churllys bable and say what they wyll
                  Hit hath ben so euer and wyll be so styll
                  For it is almyghty goddys purueaunce
                  wyse men of folys to haue the gouernaunce
                  And they that rule well I beseech Ihesu
                  Send them good lyfe & long to contynew
               
               Amen.
            
            
               The Philosopher
               ye soferayns all dyscrete & excellent
               Before whom thys dyalog shewyd hath be
               Touchyng iii. poynts by wey of argument
               Furst what is gentylnes & what nobylyte
               And who shulde be chose to hye auctoryte
               Thys questyons they be so hye and sottell
               Few dare p̄sume to dyffyne them well
               
                  ¶Yet I thynk now under your coreccyons
               The thyng that makyth a gentylman to be
               ys but vertew & gentyll condycyons
               whych as well in pore men oft tymys we se
               As in men of grete byrth of hye degre
               And also vycious churlyssh cōdycyons
               May be in men born to grete possessyons
               ¶And forther as touchyng nobylyte
               yet standyth much ꝑt I thynk doutles
               An suffycyencye reason doth agre
               But that suffysaunce makyng noblenes
               Must nedys he ānexid vnto goodnes
               For suffysauns is not the cause pryncypall
               That god his noble but hys goodnes wythall
               ¶So vertue is euer the thyng pryncypall
               That gentylnes & noblenes doth insue
               Then these hedys rulers & gouernours all
               Shuld come therto be cause of theyr vertue
               And in auctoryte they ought not contynue
               Except they be good men dyscrete & wyse
               And haue a loue & zele vnto Iustyce
               ¶wherfore souereyns all that here present be
               Now marke well these reasons here brought in
               Both agayns men of hye & of low degre
               For thys intent only to rebuke syn
               For the best wey that is for one to begyn
               To cōuert the people by exortacyon
               ys to ꝑswade them by naturall reason
               ¶For when that a man by hys owne reason
               Iuggyth hymselfe for to offend
               That grudgyth his cōscyens & gyffyth cōpuncyon
               Into hys herte to cause hym amend
               But such blynd bestꝭ that wyl not intend
               To here no good councell nor reason
               Ought by thee law to haue sharp coreccyon
               ¶But then yf the laws be not suffycyent
               whych haue be made & ordeynyd before
               To gyfe ther fore cōdygne ponyshment
               The pryncys & gouernours be bound euermore
               To cause new laws to be made therfore
               And to put such men in auctocyte
               That good men Iust & indyfferent be
               ¶But because that men of nature euermore
               Be frayle & folowyng sensualyte
               
                  yt is impossyble in a maner therfore
               For any gouernouss that be in auctoryte
               At all tymys Iust & indyfferent to be
               Except thes be brydelyd & therto compellyd
               By some strayt laws for them deuysyd
               ¶As thus that no man such rome ocupye
               But certayn yerys & than to be remouyd
               yet that whyle bound to attend dylygently
               And yf he offend & surely prouyd
               wyth out any fauour that he be ponyhysshyd
               For the ponysshment of a Iuge or offycer
               Doth more good than of thousand other
               ¶And vntyll that such orders be deuysyd
               Substauncyally / and put in execucyon
               Loke neuer to see the world amended
               Nor of the gret myschefes the reformacion
               But they that be bounde to see the thyngꝭ done
               I pray god of his grace put in theyr myndys
               To reforme shortly suche thynges amys
               ¶And though that I my selfe now prase
               Thus myn oppynyon haue publysshed
               Or any of my felowes hare in this place
               In any poynt here haue vs abused
               we beseche you to holde vs excused
               And so the auctour hereof requyreth you all
               And thus I cōmyt you to god eternall.
               AMEN.
