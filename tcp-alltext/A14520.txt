ƲIRGINIA.
            
               WHereas vpon the returne of Sir Thomas
Dale Knight, (Marſhall of VIRGINIA)
the Treaſurer, Councell, and Company
of the ſame, haue beene throughly informed
and aſſured of the good eſtate of that
Colony, and how by the bleſſing of God
and good gouernment, there is great
plentie and increaſe of Corne, Cattell,
Goates, Swine, and ſuch other prouiſions,
neceſſary for the life and ſuſtenance of
man; And that there wants nothing for
the ſetling of that Chriſtian Plantation,
but more hands to gather and returne
thoſe commodities which may bring profit
to the Aduenturers, and encouragement to others: And whereas therevpon
the Company hath giuen a Commiſſion to Captaine Samuel Argol to be
the preſent Gouernour of that Colonie, who hath vndertaken to tranſport and
carry thither a certaine number of men, vpon his owne charge, and the
charge of other his friends that ioyne with him in that Voyage; in which,
diuers men of good qualitie haue reſolued to aduenture, and to goe thither
themſelues in perſon, and to carry with them their Wiues, their Children and
their Families, whereby in ſhort time (by the fauour and aſſiſtance of Almighty
God) that good worke may be brought to good perfection, by the diuiſion
and ſetting out of lands to euery particular perſon, the ſetling of trade,
and returne of Commodities to the contentment and ſatiſfaction of all well
affected Subiects, which eyther loue the aduancement of Religion, or the honour
and welfare of this Kingdome: Wee his Maieſties Treaſurer, Councell,
and Company for the ſame Plantation, haue thought good to declare
and make knowne to all men by theſe preſents, that wee haue reſolued to
giue free leaue and licenſe to any who are now remaining in VIRGINIA, at
his will and pleaſure to returne home into England, which liberty wee doe
likewiſe grant and confirme vnto all thoſe which hereafter from time to time
ſhall goe thither in perſon, without any other reſtraint, then to aſke leaue of
the Gouernour (for the time being) to depart. And therefore if any man be
diſpoſed to ſend any ſupply to his friends there, or to ſend for any of his
friends from thence, he may hereby take notice, that he hath full power and
meanes to doe eyther of them at his good deſcretion.
            God ſaue the King.
