Of whose good successe and of the good successe of his posteritie in that countrie, togither with their expulsing or rather subduing by the Imperialls, for as much as this Historie of Leonard Aretine doth at large entreate I will not be tedious in repeating the same. Howbeit it is to be vnderstanded that after the battell of Nuceria where Teias last kinge of the Gothes was slayne, althoughe some departed awaye wyth such thinges as they had according to couenant yet the greater part of them taryed stil: ye which degenerating into ye name of Italians, lost both their empyre & own name for euer the lxxi. yere after their first cōming into ye coūtry vnder Theoderich, being ye yere of grace CCCCC L.

of the one be more to be lamented, or the vnaduisednesse and follye of the other (if I maye terme the thyng accordynge to desert) be to be blamed. For Belisarius after that he had recouered 
                  〈◊〉
                from the Uandales, vanquisshed the Persians, fought prosperously agaynste the Medes, abated the power and pulled downe the hygh courages of the Gothes openinge a waye of conquest to hys successour, and atcheued so many hault enterprises and Marciall exploytes that the gloryous fame of hys doynges did sprede hys renowne ouer all the worlde and made hys name immortall, in so muche that he was accompted as a perfecte and incomparable Mirrour for all Captaynes to beholde, and a verrye mayster of Cheualrye, whome neyther ambytion the common corrupter of noble hartes, nor the licentyous lybertye of the Campe, nor the instigatyons of myghtye

Princes could withdrawe from hys allegeans and promise made to the Emperour Iustinian. Was in the ende in hys olde dayes vppon lyghte suspicion wythoute proofe, by the same Emperour for whom he had so often put hys lyfe in perill: to whom he had acquired so muche honour, whose fauour he had estemed more then to raygne himselfe

                  For what man had so lytle witte that could not vnderstand, that if Belisarius were in any hope at all of winning the citie, he would neuer haue consented to tharticles that were sent vnto him. But nowe because he was out of all hope, he had graūted to those things which he would not stand to, to thentent to make them traitours at theyr vttermoste peryll. For if he bare them so much good wyll as he pretended, he would not haue there taricd to surprise thē by subteltie, but would haue kept on his way to trye the matter by battel against Theodatus and his Gothes. By alledgynge these and suche other thyngs, they both persuaded the Citizens to make resistence, and also encouraged the Gothes to stand to the de fence of the Citie. Besids this they armed the Iewes, of the which ther was a great multitude in Naples, & caused them to take their parte. By meanes whereof the rest of the citizins were put in feare, and all the communicatiō

Oftentymes when he attempted to winne it by assaulte, he was put to the repulse with great losse and peryll of hys souldiours. For the walles of Naples are partly enuironed with the sea, and partly do stand vppon high and steepe places, so that it is a very harde matter to scale them. The conduit pypes by which water ranne into the citie, albeit they were all broken by Belisarius: yet not withstanding it semed to be no great discommoditie to them that were besieged, because they had manye Welles in the towne, so that they could want no water. But most of all hurted them the hope of helpe to come, for as much as thei had sent their Ambassadours to Rome for ayde against their enemies. Now as Belisarius was in maner paste hope, and thought to haue broken vp his siege, Fortune wonderfully opened the way

of conquest vnto him. There was a wa ter chanel cut deepe into the groūde by which water was wont to be cōueyed into the citie. This at the beginning of the siege had Belisarius broken (as he had done other before). A certain souldier of Clandiople by chaunce entering into the same, went in it hard to the walles of the citie. There was at the place where it went vnder the wallGood fortune of Belisarius. a stone not layed by mannes hand but of nature, through the whiche there was a hole bored to let the water into the citie. But the hole was not so wyde that a man might enter in at it. The which when the souldier had well viewed, he perceyued that if the hole in the stone were made wyder, they myght haue passage into the Citie.
               And therevppon he made Belisarius priuye to all that he hadde seene. The Captaine greatly reioysyng thereat, and promisynge great rewardes, bade the souldyer choose some of hys fellowes to helpe hym, and to open the

those things which had lately hapened chaūced not through the imbecillitie & weakenes of their nacion, but because that the Gothes could not find in their harts to loue & obey Theodatus. But now considering they agreed all in one will & drew all by one lyne, cleane contrary effects must nedes followe. And therefore no man should be able to attempt any alteration hereafter in Italy, but that he shoulde be met with to his cost. Al these things he did discourse before Liberius bishop of Rome. And for because he was but a newe founde kyng, he caused the bishop & the people to swere to be trew vnto him. For the more assuraunce wherof, he chose manye of the Senatours and people of Rome, whome he ledde with him as pledges, committing the charge of the citic to one of his noble men called Luderis, with whome he left foure thousande chosen souldyers to keepe Rome withall. He hym selfe with the residue of his army made towarde Rauenna.

               But as Uitigis was aboute to assemble the Gothes that were about the riuer Po and the citie Pauie and other places in Lūbardy of which there was great power and an huge number, a stoppe was cast in hys way, namely the feare of the French nacion. For at that tyme they had extended their dominion euen vnto the Alpes, and on thys side the Alpes the Gothes possessed al. These two nacions were scarce frends

For the which causes Uitigis sen ding his Ambassadours into Fraunce endeuored to rid himself of that feare, the which he at length obteyned by entring in league and frendshippe with them. Whyle Uitigis was laying for these things before hand, in the meane season Belisarius hauynge refreshed and furnished his armie, determined to go to Rome. Wherevppon leauing Herodian with a garrison at Naples, and another garrison lykewise at Cume, he with the residue marched toward Rome. His iorney lay by the way that leadeth from Rome into Latium. The Romains hearing of Belisarius approche, were nothing discontended therewith. It chauuced so that one Fidelis of Millaine (who in the tyme of

Athalericke had bene stewarde of the kings house) departing frō Rome met with Belisarius, & counsailed him to bring his hoste with all spede nere to y•

With the which thinges the Gothes being sore dismayed that were left there in garrison, determined fully to go all awaye: sauyng the Captayn Luderis: who standing vpon his reputation, had rather to haue died then to abandon the town cōmitted to his charge. The Romains gaue y• Gothes free passage wtout interruption.

And the noyse could not be stynted, vntill such time as messengers comming from thence, brought word that all was quiet and no enemy sene or heard of there.

your selues to the tuicion of a few Grekyshe men, mariners, and plaiers, of enterludes, & good for nothing els, despising y• power of the Gothes, whiche euen at their very fyrste comming haue put them to flighte and beseiged them? Surely the Gothes haue not de serued that ye shoulde worke so greate treason against them. But repent and amend, for this is thonely way for you to escape, yf you wyll open the gate for the Gothes to enter in, not against you but against those Grekes. But if ye be so mad to persist in your folly, loke assuredlye for such warre at the Gothes hands, as, wilbe to whote for you to abyde. Thys oure kynge Uitigis commaunded to be told vnto you. The Ro maines made none aunswere at all to his wordes. But as sone as it was reported that ye Gothes were there, there was ronning thether from all parts of the citie. The Gothes hauing taryed a lyttle whyle, returned to their kinges tent which was betwene the citye and

The lyke commodity of grinding was also ministred by other of the conduits in diuers places. The which being then brokē, brought great distresse vpon them that were be seiged. Against this displeasure BelisaA prouision for grinding of corne. rius prouided this remedie. Two ligh ters with a space betwene theym for a whele to goe in, were fastned together with strong rafters of timber, vpon the which the milles were set and so driuē with the swiftnes and violence of the streame, and the lighters were stayed with Cables streyned hard and made fast on both sydes of the Ryuer. These lyghters he placed harde by the firsie brydge that leadeth ouer Tiber. After those he set other lyghters on a rowe. And least the enemye might hurte the lighters by casting downe fyre or other stuffe from alofte, there were cheynes

of yron drawē by the brydge to receiue all such gere, and men set on both sides to take the same & cary it away. Thus was good prouison made to supply the want of milles, for those lighters suffyced to grynd as much as they would. As for the want of water, that dyd the ryuer Tiber supplye. Belisarius had on diuers places of the walles deuised many engines to strike and put backe thenemy withall.

Moreouer the Gothes made Turretes of Tymber of lyke heigh with the walles, the whiche went vppon fyue wheles a pece. Also they prepared a great number of skaling ladders, together with

an innumerable sorte of faggottes of shrubbes and strawe to fyll vp the dyches.

For Belisarius beynge a most expert captaine in feats of armes, taught his horsmen what they should do, shewing them how farre they shuld go, & where and when they should stay. One while he sent out his horsmen sodainly at the gates Salaria and Pinciana, and disquietted the Gothes that encamped theraboutes. Another while he would yssue oute at Aurelius gate and be doyng wyth the Gothes that lay betwen Adrians tumbe & the bridge Miluius.

In these conflictes the souldiers of Be lisarius beganne to preualle. Not that they were able to match the whole power of theyr enemyes horsemen, but because they seemed to be to good for them being equally matched as many to as many, or some what mo in number then they them selues were, and to be of more conning and audacitie in their feighting. His horsemen being thus by litle and litle practised, began to set lyght by the horsemen of theyr enemies. And the besieged beganne to take courage and confidence vnto them.

                  And therevpon he disposed his armye in this wyse. First he commaunded one band to issue out at the gate of Aurelius and to stand in battell raye before Adrianus tumbe against theyr enemies. The charge of this bande he commited to Ualentine Lieutenant of the horsemen, geuing him besides his horsemen a certayne of the olde expert footemen, and of the peopl

For hys mynde was no moore but to deteyne that parte of the Gothes that encamped in that place, styll there, to the entent they shoulde not succour

theyr felowes at the gate Salaria where he determined to feyght. Then made he two other battels, one at the gate Saleria, and another at the gate Pinciana. And in them both he placed the horsemen in the forewarde, and the footemen in the rereward, commaundynge eche battell to issue out at theyr seuerall gates and to marche toward theyr enemies. Uitigis kynge of the Gothes hauyng intelligence by certayne runnagates that he shoulde haue battell the nexte morowe, caused the Gothes to arme them selues by the breake of the daye. In orderyng of hys battelles, he set hys footemen in the middes, and on eche syde of them hys horsemen, as it were in wynges. In thys order he proceded agaynst Belisarius and gaue hym battell. The Souldyers on bothe sydes encountered together very fyercely. And the Captaynes folowynge after them, Belisarius on the one syde and Uitigis on the other, encouraged

their parties. At the beginning of the battell, the Souldiers of Belisarius were farre to strong for their enemies, and many of the Gothes were slaine. The battell was foughte harde by their campe, by meanes whereof the Gothes abounding in multitude, sent euer freshe and freshe in steed of them that were ouerthrowen. In this sorte the conflict lasted vntyll it was noone, neyther partye gettynge aduantage of other. Howbeit the Souldyers of Belisarius foughte more cherefullye.

sawe that no body folowed after them stayed in the next mountaynes. From thence beholdyng theyr tentes to be pulled downe and caryed away, when they perceyued howe theyr enemyes kept neyther any order nor warrelyke discipline, they encouraged one another and gaue a newe charge vppon them. Whome (by reason they were laden and skattered in gatherynge of the spoyle) they easly ouercame, and so both saued theyr tentes and also recouered theyr pray. By that tyme Fortune beganne to chaunge her copie aboute the kinges campe also. For the Gothishe footemen resorting in great number out of the nexte campe, cast them selues vppon Belisarius horsemen, and keueryng them selues wyth theyr shieldes in maner of a vaulte, preased so sore vppon the forefront of theyr battell, that they compelled them to lose grounde.

Uppon this matter rose preuye grudge and hartburnyng, the Gothes sekynge meanes to requite Belisarius wyth the lyke. For those thre cities being taken, did Belisarius great pleasure and seruice for the warres. Wynter drew on a pace. And Belisarius hauing men of warre good store, determined to send forth his horsmen to winter in the country. Whervppon besides those that went into other places. He sent MM. into the Country of the Picents. Ouer whō he made captaine Iohn Uitalian geuinge him instructions what he would haue hym to do. There were in the same countrye the wiues and children of the Gothes, for the husbāds & fathers were al come to the siege of Rome as many as were able to beare armour. If the truce continued,

he had he shuld not stirre, but yf the Gothes should happen to worke anye thynge contrarye to the articles of the Truce, then he wylled hym to make hauocke and spoyle, and to take as manye townes as he could. If any towne made resistens he commaunded hym to besyege it, and not to passe from it vntyll he had wonne it. For he thoughte it shoulde not be for hys ease to proceede onward, and leaue the Townes of hys enemyes behynde hym. Wyth these wordes and instructions Belisariaus sent Iohn amonge the Picentes wyth an armye. The verye same tyme Datius ByshoppeDatius bisshoppe of Millaine. of Myllaine, and wyth hym certayne of the heade Cityzens came to Belisarius declarynge vnto hym, that the Cytye of Myllame shoulde be at the Emperours commaundement, yf he woulde send neuer so slender a garryson thyther.

Duringe thys tyme that all thynges thus prospered and followed theyr desyres, there happened an horrible daunger, the whyche in one moment had almoste tourned all thynges vppe syde downe. There was one Presidius a citizen of Rome who beynge wont to dwell at Rauenna, in the begynnyng of thys warre stale awaye from thence, and came to Rome. In hys iourney the souldyers of Constantyne whiche laye at Spolet, had taken from hym a sword curiouslye wroughte and costlye vernyshed. The man beynge robbed and

takynge the dyspleasure in yll parte, had made complaint thereof to Belisarius wyth request to haue hys good restored again. And Belisarius had ge uen commaundement that it shoulde be so. But by meanes of the warre and of the syege whyche afterwarde ensewed, the souldyers beynge otherwyse occupyed and the Captayne 
                     〈◊〉
                   aboute weightier matters, the thynge was delayed. At the length in thys tyme (as I sayde) whyles all thynges were in ioyfull estate, as Belisarius rodde through the towne. Presidius caughte hys Horse by the brydle, and wyth a lowd and complaynynge voyce, in the audyence of a greate number, asked hym yf it were meete that a Cytyzen of Rome (who abandonynge all that euer he had to the enemy had fled away naked) shuld also be robbed by his souldiers of that little y• he had caryed away wt him, and be thus wrongfully

and iniurlously dealt withall. He sayd he had oftentymes putte vp hys complaynt vnto him of the wrong and violence that had bene offered, and coulde haue no redresse, and yet they that had robbed hym, had hys good wythin the Cyty, and dyd weare it daylye before hys face. These wordes dyd styrre the pacience of Belisarius verye sore.
               And therfore assoone as he came home he caused Constantine to be called before hym (for they were his souldiers that had taken awaye the sworde) and gaue hym a great rebuke for neglectyng of his commaundement so oftentymes in delyuerynge of the sworde. Marry (ꝙ Constantine) I wyll rather throwe it into the Tyber, then I wyll restore it to that Uarlet. This was very lewdly and presumptuously answered. Then sayde Belisarius vnto him, art not thou vnder me? Yes sayd he, for as much as it is the Emperours plea

whyles I lyue. When Belisarius hard hym saye so, he was more angrye with hym then before, and called for the Serieauntes. Constantine knowing that it should be to his coste that the Serieauntes were sent for, drewe out his Dagger that hung at his thigh and lyke a Bedlem runnyng at Belisarius, and dabbed hym in a lytle beneath the stomacke. Out of dout yf such as stood by, had not spedely stept vnto him, and wronge the Dagger out of hys hande, and delyuered hym to the officers, Belisarius had surely died for it, and hys death had drawen all things with it to vtter ruine, & the Gothes had the same day bene made lords of all. But God of hys infinite goodnes woulde not suffer so great a mischaunce to happen. And after at the commaundement of Belisarius, Constantine was put to death. Within a whyle after, the Gothes attempted toTreason twise detected. haue taken Rome by stealth, first by a way that they founde out in one of the

channells of the conduites in the night tyme, and afterwarde by stealing ouer the ryuer in botes nere vnto the fielde of Mars. But they missed of their purpose in both places. For in the channel theyr owne lyghts bewrayed theyr couert workyng, by meanes whereof the channell was stopped, & they enclosed from gettyng out. And at the field of Mars their treason was detected, & so their attempt was made frustrat. The treason was deuised in this wise. Two rascall

And to bring theyr purpose to effect, they deuised this policie. Beneath the field of Mars in one place, the walles were verye weake & sore decayed for lacke of looking to, by reasō (as I think) thei y• had ben before

tymes, trusted altogether tō the defens of the Ryuer. Uitigis therfore caused lyghters & barges and al

                   kind of botes to be put in a readinesse at the brydge Miluius. For had he once set any con uenient number of hys souldiers, ouer on thother side of the ryuer, he thought it would be an easie matter, after the landing of the first, to conuey ouer still mo and mo in the same vesselles. He douted nothing so muche as that the watchmen that warded on that side should escrie hym and bewray his deuise. For the auoyding of which dout, he corrupted the two Romaines for a piece of money, to further thys attempt. To whome he delyuered a sleping pouder willing them to geue it the watchmen with wine, to thentent that when they had dronke the same, they might fall into a dead slepe. After these conueances were thus deuised, & agreed vppon, the one of them beyng stryken with repentance, disclosed the whole matter to Belisarius, and

there vppon the other beynge taken with the slepie medicine aboute hym, that the Kynge hadde geuen hym, was put to the torture and compelled to vtter all the order of the matter.
               The whiche done, Belisarius caused his nose and eares to be cut of, and settyng hym vppon an Asse, sent hym out at the Pincian gate to the Gothish Campe, to the entent that Uitigis might perceiue how that his close workyng was detected, and his secret practises browght to lyght.

For when the one halfe of hys armye was passed the bridge, Belisarius commaunded hys men to set vppon them that were behynde, amonge whome he made suche a slaughter, that a greate number of theym that escaped hys handes, for haste in gettynge

ouer the bridge were throwen downe on both sides and drowned. This siege of the citie of Rome endured a whole yere and nyne dayes, taking his beginning about the. xiiij. or. xv. daye of March.

               VItigis albeit he made speede toward Rauenna, yet not withstanding he coueted to kepe the cities of Hetruria and of other Prouinces in theyr accustomed obedience. And therfore he placed at Clasium a thousande horsemen, as manye at Urbiuetus, fyue hundred at Tudert, foure thousande

at Auxiuum, at Urbine. ij. thousande, fyue hundred at Cesena, and asVitigis goeth to besege Arimine. many at Mountferrat. And he hymselfe with the rest of his armie went to besiege Arimine. Belisarius after the departure of the Gothes, commaunded Martine and Ildiger with a thousande horsemen to make hast to Arimine, & to bryng John & his horsemen that were with him from thence, placing fotemen there in their steds. The whiche thinge he did to the entent he woulde not haue that bande (wherein were the best horsemen of the hoste) besieged by the enemie. For if so be it that Arimine were manned with fote men, he thoughte that the Gothes would not bestowe theyr labour in besieging of it. And if they shoulde besiege it, he thought the footemen shuld be better able to endure out the siege then horsemen, for as muche as it is a difficulte matter to keepe horses in a siege, and footemen might easly be conueyed to Arimine at all tymes

For he was a noble man in hys countrey, and of muche power, and such a one as wyth his presence might greatly haue furthered the warre that was in hand. Mundilas therefore and the reste of his companye keepynge on theyr iourney towardeMillaine and other cities of Lumbardy be come Imperial Millaine, were receyued into the Citie.

Whyle these thynges were in doinge, Uitigis sent another armye vnto Auximum. For he was vtterlye determyned to reteyne and kéepe styll that Citye. Wyth thys armye he sent a newe deputye to haue the charge of the Towne and the men of warre, named Uacinius.

It was aboute noone when this newes was brought to the campe. And thervpon proclamacion was made to harnesse, & that euery man shoulde fall in order of battell vnder his antesygne. The Captaines hauyng putte their men in araye, waited for the commynge of Belisarius, lookyng continually toward the moun taines from whence he was reported

Mundilas had of necessitie bene driuen before to disperse his soldiers into Come, Bergome, & Nouaria, so that he had no great number of horsemen aboute hym. Howe be it the hardest of the mat ter was not the defence of the citie, for the Citizens of Millain wyth one accor

thereof, sent Martine & Uliarius thither with a great power, to thentent that Mundilas & they ioynyng together, might remoue the Gothes further of. When they came at the ryuer Po, which is frō Millain but one days iourney, they durst not passe ouer for feare of their enemies, but lyngered many dayes in the same place, frustrating day by day the hope of Mundilas & them that were besieged wt him. For where as they made promise to haue passed the riuer & come vnto Millaine, thei performed no part thereof. Dayly both hope & sustenance failed those that were besiged. At y• last after long lyngering Martine & Uliarius confessing the truth aduertised Belisarius y• they alone were not able to passe ouer y• riuer against so great a power of their enemies, onles they woulde wylfully runne in open danger of their liues. Wherefore if he thought it good, he shuld cause Iohn & Iustine which wer wt theyr armies not farre frō Bononie

They sent hym worde againe that they woulde nothing do without the cōmaūdement of Narses. Therevppon Belisarius wrate again vnto Narses. Who albeit he gaue his consent that the armye shoulde go thyther, yet not withstanding, for as much as it was a thing done by Belisarius, he went about it verye slowly and negligently as men are wont to do in other mens businesses. By this meanes the matter was so longe delayed, that at last they were vtterly deceyued. In the meane tyme Millaine was euery daye sorer afflicted then other, intollerable hungre welnye pyned them away, and the citie wauing betwene hope & feare, abode such miseries & anguish as almost no menwere able to abide

In this ruine & ouer throw of ye citie, were slain of y• Millainers about. xxx. M. When Belisarius had tidings of it, he tooke great sorow for the same, & wrate vnto themperour Iustinian, the beginning and proceding of all the whole matter.
               
                  Iustinian being certified of the trueth, was much offended thereat, but yet pu nisshed not any man for it. Only he cal led home Narses out of Italy, cōmittingNarses is called out of Italy. the whole charge & authoritie of the warre vnto Belisarius. Herevpon Narses wt part of his armie retourned into Grece, & Belisarius with all the rest abode still in Italy. Who now hauing no man to ouerthwart him in his determinatiōs concerning the warre. Although that his chief care rested vppon Uitigis & Rauenna, yet he minded to take two townes mo from the Gothes, before he proceded with hys arinie against Uitigis & Rauenna. The towns that he desired were Auximum and

because that as long as ye Gothes held that citie, he thought nothing shuld be in rest through Hetruria. Herevpon he deuided his army into thre parts, of the which he toke one with him to besiege Auximum, another he sent by Iustine & Cyprian against Fesules, & the third he betoke to Martine & Iohn Uitalian, cōmaunding them to encampe abouts the riuer Po, & to deteyne Uraias with his hoste as long as they could in those borders, to thentent thei shoulde not come to raise any of the siges among ye Thuskans & Picents. And if thei were not able to kepe him still there, then to folow him in the taile. Martine & Iohn therfore setting forth into Lubardye wt that part of the armye that we spake of before, wanne the citie Dertone situate by the riuer Po, and from thence did their endeuour to trouble Uraias & ye Gothes. Cyprian & Iustin wt another armye going vnto Fesules, albeit the besieging of that citie were very difficil for ye nature & roughnes of the place,

yet not withstandyng they brought theyr campe as nere as they could, & be sieged it from a higher ground, where the way lay more plaine to the towne. Belisarius himself with the puyssantestBelis. besiegeth Auximū. company of all, beset Auximum. Uitigis had placed in Auximum the best that he could pyke out among the Gothes, & was very circumspect in fortifiyng of that towne. Coniecturing that which was most true, namely that Belisarius would neuer procede to the besieging of Rauenna, onles he had first subdued Auximum. When Belifarius had well viewed the situation & nature of the place, he was past all hope of winning Auximum by force. For the citie standeth vpon somwhat a high grounde, & besides that there were within to defende it, apuyssant band of chosen men of warre, able to geue battell euen in thopen field. So he had none other hope, but only to tame them by famin, for asmuch as there was a great number enclosed wt
                  in

the citie. And therefore Belisarius omitting assault, pitched his campe round about the hill on euery side, narrowly watching that nothing shoulde be conueyed in to them. But lyke as that large compasse of his campe was good to prohibit the portage of things in, so was it vnprofitable against sodain inuasions of the enemie. For they that were wtin, might at their pleasure make sodaine assaults vpon what part of the Campe they lysted out of the towne aboue. And the souldyes of Belisarius lay so farre one from another, that they coulde not readily helpe at need. By this meanes it came to passe that the enemye continually infested the campe, and diuers skyrmysshes were therevppon fought. Moreouer, there was a certain moyst ground not farre from the citie, where there grew muche grasse. This field was as it were the place of theyr dayly exercises, when eyther the besiegers or the besieged resorted thyther for forage: and

sometyme theyr courages were so kyndeled on bothe sydes, that almoste all the whole Campe ranne thyther to feyght. In these encounters the Souldyers of Belisarius preuayled in multitude, and the Gothes by the situation of the place, bothe partes beynge equall in manhod and prowesse. The lyke conflictes were also at Fesules, for there were manye sodayne alarmes geuen, and welnye daylye skyrmyshes betwen
                     •
                   the besiegers and the besieged.
               The besiegers had none other hope of atteynynge theyr desyre, then by keepynge the besieged from sustenaunce, and famisshinge them for want of foode. For there was no hope to wynne so stronge Cities as those were by force. And therefore by takynge vp standynges in places conuenient about the townes, they cutte of all carryages and conueyaunce of thynges in.

This was the occasion why they passed the Alpes. The same tyme Uraias beyng often writtē to by Uitigis, had passed the Ryuer Po and was marchinge wyth hys armye toward Rauenna.

                  WYthin a stones cast of the walles of Auximum, on the north side of the towne there was a wel wt a very freshe spring the which Belisarius purposed to take from theym, bycause he perceiued that the townsmen had none other place to fetch water at but onely there. To bring this matter to effect he commaunded his armye to be in armour by the dauninge of the next day, and to geue an approch to the walles. The Gothes thinkinge they had prepared them to thassault, placed themselues orderly vppon the battell ments. Belisarius in the meane time sent fiue men conninge in such feats. with mattockes and axes, well pauished wt the bucklars and tergattes of a great number that were sent wt them for their defence, to vndermine the well and to cutte downe the tymber work.

Howbeit Belisarius was euer at hand calling still vpon hys men and encouraging them wt a lowd voice and would not suffer theym to geue backe, but euer put freshe men in the places of suche as were wounded or slaine. This encounter being begonne by the sunne rising, lasted vntil noone. At the last his souldiers pearsing stout ly vpon the Gothes, compelled theym to recoyle into the towne. Then they

returned backe and called away those that were digging downe y• well, supposinge that they had dispatched their worke. But they had done litle or nothing to the purpose in mining downe of the Mason worke. The cause therof was by reason that y• well being made in old time, was wrought so close and so sure, that it had bene an easier matter to cutte a piece out of a whole quar rte then to haue dygged downe anye parte of the wall of it. When it was perceyued howe that all that they had done, and all theyr feyghtynge was but lost labour, Belisarius caused the reste of the water to be infected wyth the Iuce of venemous herbes, wyth stynkinge Carions of dead cattell, and wyth a kynde of stone called Asuest so longe vntyll he had vtterlye marred it, that it was not to be occupied any more, so that the Gothes fyndynge scarcetye of water by the mystre of thys well, had muche a doe to relyeue theym selues wyth that lyttle

out of Fraunce to Uitigis, offering that the FrenchemenFrench Ambassadours to Vitigis. should come into Italy and rayse the syege, aud doubtlesse to slea Belisarius wyth all hys armye, yf so be yt that the Gothes woulde be content to admitte them as coparteners of their Empyre.

For if the Frenchmen came into Italy, it was not to be doubted that they shuld get the vpper hand, but it was a difficulte matter to be beleued, that they would keepe touche and play the good fellowes in parting of the Empyre.

For he beynge a sage Captayne and pollitique in all affayres, as sone as he knewe of the commynge of the Frenche Ambassadours, sent his commyssioners also to Rauenna, both to offer the Gothes peace and attonement wyth the Emperour, and also to wythdrawe theym from societye wyth the Frenchemen, by puttynge them in remembrance of their former vnfaythefull dealynge.

And therefore Theodorich kyng of the Gothes dyd both place a puyssaunt company of his countrey men with their wyues and children in those wast grounds, and also buylded them casteles & holds. Sisigis one of ye Gotishe nobilitie, who had certain Castles in Thalpes, was the first of all that of his frewyll receyued the souldyers sent into those coasts by Belisarius, persuading other Castles to do the lyke. The same tyme Uraias was in Lumbardy, musteryng of souldyers to carye wyth hym to Rauenna. He had already raised an army of foure thousand men. Of the which the most part were inhabiters of Thalpes.
               Who hearyng that Sisigis was reuolted

to their enemies, & that the Castles wherein they had their wyues & children were assayled, they compelled Uraias first & formest to lead them thither. Wherevppon he tooke his iourney wt al the power that he had raised, into Thalpes, and there besieged Sisigis and the souldyers of Belisarius. When newes of this gere came to Iohn Uitalian and Martine, who the same tyme had theyr campe in Lumbardye, they also without further tariance marched toward Thalpes, & toke certain Castles in theyr waye. In the same were taken many of the wyues and chyldren of them that serued vnder Uraias. When the fathers, husbands, & kinsfolke of them had knowledge thereof, they forsooke Uraias campe & fled to theyr enemies, to the entent to recouer them againe.
               Uraias beyng thus forsaken of hys owne souldyers, retourned with a few into Lumbardy, & neuer set his minde any mōre eyther about musterynge of

other souldiers, or succouringe such as were besieged. So Uitigis & the Gothes that were at Rauenna, beyng for saken of their owne people & destitute of all hope of comforte, were still beseiged and suffered euerye day more distresse then other. Whyle the Gothes stoode in this estate, thambassadours returned frō themperour, Dominicus & Maximus both of the Senate.

That Uitigis should hold styll all that he had beyond the ryuer Po, & surrender all that he had on thyssyde. That he should delyuer to the Emperour thone half of his threasure, & kepe the other half for him selfe & that all the Gothes inhabityng on the hyther syde of the Ryuer Po, should become subiectes to thempyrs of Rome. When the Ambassadours had first conferred wt Belisarius, they

entered into Rauenna and declared their commission, the which things both Uitigis and the noble men of the Gothes were glad to here, and consented thereto with all their hartes. ButA crafty & suttell kynde of dealing. Belisarius was very sory to see it. For it spyted him to the hart, that when he might fully haue had the victorie of the Gothes, it shoulde be taken out of his hand. And therefore anone after when the commissioners retourned, and requested him to subscribe the articles he would not put to his hand. The which thing brought the Gothes in a merueylous maze, fearing to be deceyued vnder a counterfet pretense of peace. In so muche that they beganne to saye openly, they woulde doe nothyng as concernyng the peace, without the consent of Belisarius. Thambassadours themselues and suche as were chiefe officers in the Campe, were greatly displeased with Belisarius doing, and thought he dyd not well in disobeyng themperours cōmaūdemēt.

And therevppon bred a suspicion, as though Belisarius went aboute to make him self emperour, & were vtterly minded to wtdrawe his obediens frō Iustinian. This suspicion was almost in euery mans head at that time with the which opiniō the Gothes being induced, sent priuely vnto him, exhorting him to take y• west Empyre vpon him himselfe, and not to acquire it to another.

And therevppon he sent one of his com pany to Rauenna, aduertising the Gothes that he was cōtented to do as thei had counselled hym, exhorting them to make spede in the matter.

There were two kinde of promises propounded by them, wher vnto they required him to be sworne. Thone was that he shoulde gouerne

them with iustice and equitie, maineteyne and supporte the customes and lawes of the Gothes, and not be offended against any of them for ought that had bene done in tymes past, with diuers other things of lyke purport.
               The other was that he shoulde from hence forth proclaime himselfe king of Italy & of the Gothes.

Furthermore there were the two sonnes of Ildouade then Kynge of the Gothes, whom Belisarius fynding in the Courte of Uitigis at Rauenna, wold not suffer to depart, but brought them away wt hym into Grece. There were other noble men of the Gothes also, whom al men beheld, wondering at the puissans of Belisarius, that had atcheued so great exploytes, and exto

In Italye after the departure of Belisarius, the order of thynges by the commaundement of the Emperour was committed to the

discretion of Iohn, of Bessas, & of Uitalis. Constantian also was come out of Dalmatia, & was added to the nūber of the Gouernours.

There was no maner of per son, but might haue casie & fre accesse to his presens: & besides that, he was wonderous bountifull & liberall. Unto his souldiers that had lost theyr horses, weapons and armour (so it were not cowardly) forthwith he gaue new agayne. Of the husbandmen he had so great regarde, that in leading of hys armie, he would not suffer any of them to be hurte or endomaged. Hys souldiers durste not be so bolde as to touche the Apples hangyng on the trees.
               
                  Through this his straightnesse in obseruing the lawe of armes, he obteyned that his campe was more plentifully serued, then the marketts in any citie. So free and without peryll was the conueyance of all things that were to be solde. His vprightnesse towarde suche Cytyes as were in societie and leage wyth hym, no man is able to reporte as it deserued. Men myghte heare of the great good tournes that he dyd for them, but not that he vered or molested any of them.
               But as for them that succeded hym, they were nothynge lyke hym, neyther in humanitie, neyther in prowesse, neyther yet in vpryght dealynge. For bothe they them selues were Pyllers and Pollers, and also they suffered theyr Souldyers to fall into all kynd of licentiousnesse & disorder, beynge proude to theyr partakers, and easye inough to be entreated toward their enemies, by meanes wherof within short space matters began to

Against this man offered himselfe to the combat Artauades the Armenian of whome mencion was made in the entering into Ueron. So in the sight of both tharmies, they fetched their races & ranne one at another with their speares in the rest.

                  ¶Iustine one of themperours captaines is be seged within Florens, & rescowed by thother imperial captaines, who in the pursute of their enemies through an vntrue report cast in sodain feare are with great slaughter put to flight. Totilas recouereth diuers tow nes in Lombardie, raiseth the walls of Bene uent & besiegeth Naples, A comparison be twene the good gouernement of Totilas and the misgouernaunce of the Imperiall Captaines.
               
               WIthin a while after this victorie, Totilas now conceuing greater things in his mind, sent an army to Hetruria wherof he made captayns thre of the worthiest men of al the Gothes,

Beldas, Rodericke, & Uliaris. There was in Hetruria a captain called Iustine, one of those y• had bene at the foresaid battell. Who after the discomfiture had neuer ceased leuing of aThe beseging of Florens & the raising of the same. new power, & fortifiyng of the townes neuertheles tharmie of Totilas came sodainly vpon him, & besieged him wtin ye walls of Florens. Iustine feared nothing so much as scarcety of victualles. For nothing coulde be conueied in, & that which was wythin alreadye, was lyke to be soone spent. Wherevppon he sent to the rest of the Captaynes at Rauenna & aduertised theym in what perill his estate stood, requesting them of succour. Being moued wt this message, Bessas, Ciprian & Iohn Uitalian came into Hetruria with their armies when the Gothes had vnderstanding of their approch, by & by they brake vp their stege & dislodged their campe, not staying anye where, vntill they came to a place called Muciall whyche is a dayes iourney from Florens.
               
                  As sone as tharmy of confederats was entered into Florens, the Captaynes thought it good to leaue a fewe behynd theym for defence of the towne, & they themselues with all the rest of tharmi

                   to marche against thenemie. Whyle they were on their way, it semed good ye some one of the Captaines should goe quickely before to assaile thenemy, & to staye him from going awaye, & the rest wt all spede should follow after. When lottes were cast, the charge of goynge before fell vnto Iohn, who with his men in good order of battell, made haste towarde the enemye. Nowe the enemies being afrayed at the cōming of the hoste, forsoke the place where they had emcamped themselues fyrst, and gate them to a hyll thereby bothe stepe and hard to clymbe vnto. Yet for all that Iohn made no curtesye at the matter when he came to place, but directed hys battell agaynst the hyll, and wyth a noble courage endeuored to get vp by playne force. Hys enemyes

stood earnestly at defence, as they that might easlye make resistens from the higher ground. In thys place whyles Iohn stroue to get vp, feightinge valiantly amonge the formest, one of hys companions was strikē through wyth a pycke and slayne hard by hys syde.An vntrue report cause of a shamefull discomfiture. Wherevpon forthwith rose an vntrue rumour (which was lyghtly beleued) that Iohn was slayne, and therwithall his men began to runne awaye. The brute hereof beinge reported to theym that came with the rest of tharmye behynd, togither wyth the fearfull flyght of suche as were at the battell, made them also most shamefully to runne away. Neyther was there any measure of their flyght, but scatteryng themselues here some & there some they brake their aray and forsoke their standard. By meanes whereof the Captaynes themselues were fayne to take theym to flyght also wythoute compulsion of any enemie. After this time they came no more togither againe, but euery mā

They were not any great number that he set forth at y• tyme, but he prepared to send a greater power oute of hand. For the whiche occasion he had sent his Chamberlaine Narses vnto ye Erulians & other barbarous nations inhabiting about the riuer of Danow, of the which some were alreadye comeDebating in counsell for the rescowing of rome. into Thrace. When tharmies were as sembled to Dirrhachiū, & that consulta tion was had as concerning the war, it was agréed by one consent first of all to rescow the romains. But how that might be done there was diuersitie of opinions. Iohn persuaded to march wt all yt whole power togither thorow Ca labre & appulia & so to go to Rome. For if they went all in one companye they might be the better able to get the vpper hand wheras if tharmie should be deuided and some should go by sea and some by lande, none of bothe partes should be able to matche the enemye.

Belisarius said he could wel alow the same opinion, if the people of Rome stood not at such an exigent. But now considering their estate, it was nedeful to make all spede y• might be. It was a long iourney to go through Calabre and Appulia, & if their enemies should mete them they might cast many letts in their way, whereas by the sea yf the wind serued, their nauie myghte wtin fiue dayes arriue in the Romaine hauen, & by theyr beinge so nere at hand, putte the Romaines in certaine hope & comfort. For he had heard of thunfortunate mischaunce of his captaines, & knew of the losse of the corne that was sent out of Sicill, wherevpon he consydered in his minde the despaire & disstresse y• the Romaines were in. Thys opinion was allowed in the counsell, & thervpon Belisarius setting forth frō Dirrhachiū arriued at Hidrunt. The Gothes which were besieging of that towne being striken with feare at the presence of Belisarius, brake vp their

siege and flying from his sight retired to Brunduse, the which is aboute two dayes iourney from Hidrunt. By and by they sent vnto Totilas aduertising him of Belisarius comming, beleuing that he would haue iournyed by land. When Totilas heard that, forthwith he putte himselfe & his armye in a readinesse to goe méete hym. But when be vnderstoode that Belisarius went by sea, he addressed hymselfe whollye to withstande hym aboute the Citie of Rome, inespecially makynge prouision that nothing mighte be conueyed into the Citie to theym that were besieged, by the Ryuer Tiber.

As sone as Totilas had worde of thys, forthwyth all other matters sette a parte, he made haste towarde Rome. Belisarius was not able to hange vppe the gates of the Citye before hys enemyes were come. For he had not so good store of Carpenters to repaire them in so short tyme. The Gothes the fyrste daye of theyr commynge encamped themselues not farre from the Citye agaynste the gate Salaria. The nexte mornyng by the rysing of the sunne, wyth great noyse and hurly burlye they marched to the assaulte. Belisarius placed allThe Gothes assault Rome and are repulsed. hys tallest and hardyest men at y• gate the rest he set vpon the walles & in the

For the Gothes came thyther of sette purpose to haue wonne the Towne at the fyrste pushe. But when they sawe better defence made then they looked for, they were in such a furye and suche a rage, that they ranne desperatly vppon theyr enemies lyke madde men, and stryuinge vnaduisedlye to gette vppe, were beaten downe and kylled wythoute mercye. It was wonder to see howe earnestlye and desperatlye it was foughte on bothe sydes that daye. For the assault beganne in the mornynge and ended not vntyll nyghte. After that it waxed darcke the Gothes retyred into theyr Tentes. But the souldyers of Belisarius partelye kepte theyr standynge vppon the walles and bulwarkes as they had beene placed by hym, and partelye warded at the Gates.
               
                  And to the entent the enemye should not sodaynely comme vppon theym in the night and take theym vnwares, he caused a greate sorte of Busshes and Brambles to be layde before the Gates. The nexte daye the Gothes approched to the Cytye in lyke sorte as they had doone before, and Belisarius and hys men made lyke resistens. But when the assaulte waxed to longe, the souldyers that kepte theyr standynge at the Gate, yssued oute boldelye and encounteryng wyth the Gothes hand to hand, at length putte theym to flyghte on that syde and wyth manye woundes draue theym farre from the Gate. And so was that assaulte ended. Afterwarde when they hadde bestowed manye dayes in healinge theyr woundes and repayrynge theyr armour, the Gothes aduaunced agayne to the assaulte of the Cytye.

It hath verye stepe bankes, and the chanell is so deepe of water that it cannot be passed.

Iohn & Arnulphc captaine of ye Erulians who also serued in y• warres with Iohn, recouered out of ye chace vnto Hidrunt, & the souldiers afterward some one way & some another resorted thither vnto thē. Thys victorie of Totilas dyd greatlye renoune hys name.

Not longe after that battell, another bande of souldiers sent from Iustinian beganne to approche vnto Hydrunt.

Captaines of thys new armye were Ualerian leader of the Armenians, & Uere leader of the Erulians. Belisarius vppon the receipt of the Emporours letters and cōmaundement, leauyng the reaste of hys armye at Rome & at Portua vnder y• charge & gouernement of his Lieuetennant Conon, with nyne hundred chosen souldiers, (whereof seuen hundred were horsemen and two hundred fotemen) toke shippyng & made sayle to ward Calabre. It was hys mynde to haue landed hys armye at Tarent, the which is two daies iourney dystant frō Hydrunt, & in the same place to haue assembled al the reast of his power about hym. But by meanes of cōtrary winds

he was compelled to land hys men in the hauen of Croton. For the violence of the tempest was suche, that he could sayle neyther backeward nor forward. Therefore when he had landed hys army at Croton, forasmuch as there was not plentye of forage in those quarters, he was constrayned to seperate hys horsemen from hys fotemen. For he hymself & his wyfe abode with his fotemē at Croton, to the entent to cal Iohn with the reast of hys power vnto hym, & commaunded hys horsemē to go further into the countrie and to stay themselues in the borders of the Turnies.

that we spake of before, & to carry corne thither to victual the towne. According to thys determination, Iohn went by & by through Appulia and the Countrye of the Marses to the Picentes by land. Ualerian chose rather to goe by water? And so hauing embarked his souldiers he arriued at Aucona, & ioyned hymself with Iohn. Yet not withstanding for al thys Totilas dyssolued not hys syege, but sending two thousand horsemen among the Picentes to defend ye townes agaynst Iohn and Ualerian, he himself with the reast of hys armye continued hys syege about Ruscian.

Wyth the rest he keept touch accordyng to hys promise. A great number of the men of warre (to the entent to saue that they had) abode still wyth Totilas.

About thys tyme Antonia the wyfe of Belisarius went to Cōstantinople

But when she found that Theodora was deceased a lyttle before, she went to themperour her selfe and with muche sute earnestly entreated hym that her husband mighte be called oute of Italye. The whyche request she easely obtayned, so muche the rather bycause the Emperour stoode in greate feare of warres in Parthia.

Furthermore he commaunded y• no man should be so hardy as to offer any wrong to ani of thother souldiers in garrison that had taken sanctuarie in y• church. Toward the Citie of Rome he neither extended any crueltie, nor went aboute to make it desolate as he had done before. But made a serch for the Citizens therof in the townes of Campanie & in other pla ces, & reduced them home again. Furthermore he made in Rome tourneies and iustes & such other princelye pastimes as are wont to be done in fortunate & quiet Cities with great cost and solemnitie, to the entent the Citizens should conceiue good hope, & haue a desire to the Citie. The houses also which had bene ouerthrowen or consumed wt fire in the former desolation of the towne, he went about to reedifie and

repayre. Finally he shewed nowe as great a desyre of replenishinge Rome as he had doone before of wasting and leauyng it desolate. Thys so great mu tabilitie and alteration of hys mynde, somme beleued to haue rysen vppon a vow that he had made to the Apostles Peter & Paule, whose tēples he myght seme to haue destroied whē he destroied y• citie. Othersome imputed it altogither to the profyte and commoditie of the warres. And dyuers doe reporte that when Totilas latelye before desyred the Frenche Kynges daughter in mariage, aunswere was made hym that he was not Kynge of Italye when he had subuerted the Cytye of Rome. The whych Taunt (men saye) altered hys mynde to the repayrynge of the Cytye. But what so euer was the cause of it, he endeuored to repayre and buylde agayne the Cytye of Rome. After thys he prepared to make a vyage into Sicill.

For the furniture whereof he builded him a great flete of Galleyes, & made a greate number of hoyes and hulkes while he was making preparation for y• same, he determined to besiege both by water and by lande Centmucelles whiche one Citye was not yet comme vnder hys subiection. Captayne of that piece was Diogenes who (as is before mencioned) escaped lately from Rome. He had gathered to hym a good stronge companie of men of warre.
               Therefore at suche tyme as the Gothyshe armie came thither and had encamped thēselues nere vnto the walls of the towne. Totilas sendyng an officer

For it was not for him to loke for any help at Justinians hand considering he neuer releued Rome al the while it was besieged, onles perchance he thought themperour did set more by Centmucells then by Rome.

Diogenes replied therunto saying, that as for to fyghte with hym he was not mynded at that time, and as for to yeld vp the towne sauing his honour and fidelitie he coulde not, before he had sente to knowe the Emperours pleasure, and to desyre helpe. Whereuppon forasmuche as he seemed to speake that which was honest and reasonable they fel to composition, that onlesse the Emperour after warnyng geuen, dyd rescowe the towne by himself or by his reputie, Diogenes should surrender it at a certayne daye. And Totilas shoulde not in the meane season by any meanes moleste or dysquiet hym. For the assurance of these Articles Hostages were deliuered, and vppon thys agreement Totilas brake vp his siege.

Regnaris makynge no delaye in the matter, put to deathe all the Souldyers that he had receyued, and then yssuynge oute of Tarent to encounter wyth Macurius was putte to the worse, and being driuen to flye with the losse of most of his souldyers when he coulde not recouer to Tarent for that the waies wers sorelayed, he gate hym to Acheruse. In the meane season Narses sendyngNarses recouereth Portua. hys armye to Portua, besieged the towne & at length recouered it. After thys he assailed Centmucelles and in likewise brought it in subiectiō. Teias also ceased not to sollicit the Frenche nation and to allure them to take hys parte in the warres, promysinge them

sometyme monnye and sometyme copertenershyppe of the kyngdome of Italye. But the Frenchemen had alreadye determyned not to entermedle themselues in anye suche warres. By meanes whereof the Gothes were disappoynted of theyr hope. Totilas in the time of hys lyfe had gathered togyther a greate Threasure at Pauye, & had layd vp no small masse of monny in the fortresse of Cume, & had made his brother Captaine of the same fortresse. When Narses had vnderstanding therof, he sent part of hys armye to besyege Cume, and he hymselfe abydynge still at Rome, endeuored to repayre the Cytye and to replenyshe it wyth people. And to the entente that the Gothes that were beyonde the Ryuer Po shoulde not rescowe Cume or anye other of the places that were besyeged, he commaunded Iohn Uitalian and Philimunt wyth theyr bandes to abyde in Hetruria, to

sette themselues agaynste the enemye at the fyrste approche and cutte them of ere they came anye further. For Teias when he perceyued that Cume was besyeged, determyned fullye to goe and rescowe it. Whervppon settynge oute of Pauye, by longe and ouerthwarte iourneyes he ledde hys hoste by the shore of the vpper sea and so throughe the countryes of the Picentes and Marses into Campanye. The whiche when Narses vnderstood he called Iohn wyth hys band oute of Hetruria. After whose commynge he marched forwarde into Campanye wyth hys whole power fullye purposing to encounter wyth Teias. ThereThe mountaine Vesuuius. is a hill in Campanye called Uesuuius oute of the tooppe whereof oftentymes ryseth vppe smoke and flames of fyre. But in the foote of the same mountain are springs of swete water the whiche doe make a brooke called Dracon that runneth not farre from the Citye Nuceria.

thys brooke is not very brode, but it is so deepe that neyther horseman nor foteman can passe it. Aboute thys ryuer bothe armyes encamped NarsesNarses & Teias encamp
