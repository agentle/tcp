                UHē Ieſus had ſpoken theſe wordes he wente forth with his diſcyples ouer the broke Cedrō: where was a gardeyn / ī to the whiche he entred with his diſcyples.

Iudas thē after that he had receyued a bonde of men / and mynyſters of the hye preeſtes and phariſes / came thyther with lanternes and fyerbrōdes and weapons. Then Ieſus knowynge all thynges that ſhulde come on hym / went forth and ſayde vnto thē / whome ſekeye? They anſwered hym. Ieſus of Nazareth Ieſus ſayde vnto thē / I am he. Iudas alſo whiche betrayed hym ſtode with hym. But as ſone as he had ſayd to them. I am he: they wēt backewardes and fell to the groūde. And he aſked thē agayne / whome ſekeye?

Of them which thou gaueſt me / haue I not loſte one Symon Peter hadde aſwearde / and drewe it / & ſmote the hye preeſtes ſeruaunt / and cut of his

ryghte eare. The ſeruauntes name was Malcus The ſayde Ieſus vnto Peter: ſhall I not drynke of the cuppe / whiche my father hathe gyuen me. Then the companye and the captayne / and the mynyſters of the Iewes toke Ieſus and bounde hym / and ledde hym awaye to Anna fyrſte: for he was father law vnto Cayphas / whiche was the hye preeſt that ſame yeare. Cayphas was he that gaue counſell to the Iewes that it was expedyēt that one man ſhulde dye for the people. And ſymō Peter folowed Ieſus / & another diſcyple that diſcyple was knowē of the hye p̄eſte / & wēt ī with Ieſꝰ ī to the palayes of the hye preeſt. But Peter ſtode at the dore without. Then went that other diſcyple whiche was knowen vnto the hye preeſt and ſpake to the dāſell that kepte the dore / and brought in Peter. Then ſayde the damſell that kepte the doore vnto Peter. Arte not thou one of this mannes diſcyples? He ſayde. I am not. The ſeruauntes and the miniſters ſtode there / and had made a fyre of cooles / for it was colde: and they warmed them ſelfes. Peter alſo ſtode amonge them and warmed him ſelfe. The hye preeſtes aſked Ieſus of his diſcyples / and of his doctryne Ieſus anſwered hym. I ſpake openly in the worlde. I euer taught in the ſynagoge and in the temple / whereal the Iues reſorted / and in ſecrete haue I ſayde nothyng. Uvhy aſkeſt thou me? Aſke them whiche herde me / what I ſayde vnto them. Beholde / they can tell what I ſayde. Uvhen he had thus ſpoken / one of the miniſters

whiche ſtode by: ſmote Ieſus on the face / ſayeng Anſwereſt thou the hye preeſt ſo. Ieſus anſwered hym? Yf I haue ſpoken euyll beare wytneſſe of the euyll. Yf I haue ſpeken well / why ſmyteſt thou me. And Annas ſent hym bounde vnto Cayphas the hye Preeſte. Symon Peter ſtode and warmed hym ſelfe. And they ſayde vnto hym. Arte thou not alſo one of his diſcyples. He denyed it / and ſayde. I am not. One of the ſeruauntes of the hye preeſt (his coſyn / whoſe eare Peter ſmote of) ſayde vnto hym. Dyd not I ſe the in the Bardeyn with hym. Peter denyed it agayne / and immediatly the cocke crewe. Then ledde they Ieſus from Cayphas into the halle of iudgement. It was in the mornynge / and they theym ſelfes wente not in to the iudgement halle / leſt they ſhulde be defyled: but that they myghte eate the paſchall Lambe. Pylate then wente out vnto them / and ſayde. Uvhat accuſacyon brynge you agaynſte this man. They anſwered and ſayde vnto hym. Yf he were not an euyll doer / we wolde not haue delyuered hym vnto the. Thē ſayde Pylate vnto them. Take ye hym / and iudge hym after youre owne lawe. Then the Iewes ſayde vnto hym. It is not laufull for vs to put any man to deathe. That the wordes of Ieſus myght be fulfylled which he ſpake ſygnyfyenge what deathe he ſhulde dye. Then Pylate entred into the iudgement hall agayne / and called

Ieſꝰ and ſayd vnto hym Arte thou the kynge of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered. Sayeſt thou that of thy ſelfe / or dyd other tell it the of me. Pylate anſwered. Am I a Iewe. Thyne owne nacyō and hye Preeſtes haue delyuered the vnto me. Uvhat haſte thou done. Ieſus anſwered. My kyngedome is not of this worlde. Yf my kyngedome were of this worlde / then wolde my mynyſters ſurelye fyghte / that I ſhulde not be delyuered vnto the Iewes / but nowe is my kyngedome not frō henſe. Pylate ſayde vnto hī. Arte thou a kynge thē. Ieſus anſwered. Thou ſayeſt that I am a kynge For this cauſe was I borne / & for this cauſe came I ī to the world / that I ſhuld beare wytneſſe vn to the trueth. And al that are of the trueth heare my voyce. Pylate ſayd vnto hym. what thynge is trueth. And when he had ſayde that he wēt out agayne vnto the Iues / and ſayd vnto them: I fynde in hym no cauſe at all. Ye haue a cuſtome that I ſhulde delyuer you one looſe at Eaſter.
            wyl ye that I looſe vnto you the kyng of Iewes? Then cryed they al agayn ſayeng. Not hym / but Barabas. That Barabas was a robber. Thē Pylate toke Ieſus and ſcourged hym. And the ſoul diours woūde a crowne of thornes and put it on his head. And they dyd on hym o purple garmēt / and ſayde: Nayle kynge of the Iewes. And they ſmote hym on the face. Pylate went forth agayn and ſayde vnto thē. Beholde I bryng hym forth to you / that ye may knowe / that I fynde no faute in hym. Thē came Ieſꝰ forth wearynge a crowne

of thorne and a robe of purple. And Pylate ſayd vnto thē. Beholde the man. When the hye preeſles and mynyſters ſawe hym / they cryed / ſayēg Crucyfye hym / Crucyfye hym. Pilate ſayd vnto thē. Take ye hym / and crucyfy hym. For I fynde no cauſe in hym. The Iues anſwered hym. We haue a lawe / and by our law he ought to dye / becauſe he made hym ſelfe the ſone of god. When Pylate herde that ſayenge / he was the more afrayde: and ſayd vnto Ieſus: whenſe arte thou? but Ieſus gaue hym none anſwere. Then ſayde Pylate vnto hym. Speakeſt thou not vnto me. Knowen thou not that I haue power to looſe the? Ieſus anſwered. Thou couldeſt haue no power at all agaynſt me / except it were gyuen the frō aboue. Therfore he that delyuered me vnto the / is more ī ſynne. And from hēs forth ſought Pylate meanes to looſe hym. But the Iewes cryed / ſayng. Yf thou let hym go thou arte not Ceſars frēde. For who ſoeuer maketh hym ſelfe a kynge / is agaynſt Ceſar. When Pylate herde that ſayēge / he brought Ieſꝰ forth / & ſat downe to gyue ſentence / in a place called the Pauemēt but ī the Hebrew tonge Babbatha. It was the Saboth euen: whiche falleth in the Eaſter feeſt & aboue the ſyrte houre. And he ſayde vnto the Iewes: Beholde your kynge. They cryed / away with hym / away with hym. Crucify hym. Pylate ſayde vnto them. Shall I crucify your kynge.
            The hye preeſtes anſwered / we haue no kynge but Ceſar. Then delyuered he hym vnto them to

be crucifyed. And they toke Ieſus and led hym away.

Whē Ieſus ſawe his mother: and the diſcyple ſtandynge / whome he loued / he ſayde vnto his mother: woman / beholde thy ſone. Then ſayde he to the diſcyple. beholde

There ſtode a veſſell full of vynegre by And they fylled a ſponge with vynegre / and wounde it about with yſope: and put it to his mouthe. Aſſone as Ieſus had receyued of the by negre / he ſayde.

            Then came the ſouldyours and brake the legges of the fyrſte / and of the other / whiche was crucyfyed with Ieſus But when they came to Ieſus: and ſawe that he was dead alredy / they brake not his legges but one of the ſouldyours with a ſpere / thruſt hy min to the ſyde / and forth with came oute bloude and water. And he that ſawe it bare recorde and his recorde is true And he knoweth that he ſayth true / that ye myght beleue alſo. Theſe thinges were doone that the ſcrypture myght be fulfylled. Ye ſhall not breake a bone of hym. And agayne another ſcrypture ſayth. They ſhall loke on hym / whom they pearſed. After that Ioſeph of Aramathia (whiche was a diſcyple of Ieſus but ſecretly for feare of the Iues) beſought pylate that he myght

take downe the body of Ieſus. And Pylate gaue hym lycence. And there came alſo Nicodemus whiche at the begynnynge came to Ieſus by nyght / and brought of myrre and Aloes myn gled togyther: about an hōdred pounde wayght Them toke they the body of Ieſu and wounde it in lynnen clothes with the odoures / as the maner of ye Iewes is to burye.
