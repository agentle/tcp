            The Preface to the
Chriſtian Reader.
            
               GReat contention
hath nowe been
of longe tyme about
the moſte
comfortable ſacrament
of the body & bloud
of Chriſt our Sauiour: in the
inquiſition and determinatiō
wherof many be charged and
condemned of hereſye, and reproued
as bringers vp of new
doctryne, not knowen of olde
in the church before Berengarius
tyme, who taught in
Fraunce, in the daies whē William
the Norman was by conqueſte
kyng of England, and
Hildebrande otherwyſe called
Gregorius the ſeuenth, was
pope of Rome: But that thou
mayeſt knowe (good chriſtian
reader) how this is aduouched

more boldly then truely, in eſpeciall
of ſome certayne men
which be more ready to maintaine
their old iudgement, thē
of humilitie to ſubmitte them
ſelues vnto a truth: here is
ſet forth vnto thee a teſtimonye
of verye auncient tyme,
wherin is plainly ſhewed what
was the iudgement of the learned
men in thys matter, in the
dayes of the Saxons before the
conqueſt. Fyrſt thou haſt here
a Sermon or homelye, for the
holy day of Eaſter, written in
the olde Engliſhe or Saxon
ſpeech, which doth of ſet purpoſe
and at large, intreate of
thys doctryne, and is found among
many other Sermons in
the ſame olde ſpeech, made for
other feſtiuall dayes and ſondayes
of the yeare, and vſed to
be ſpoken orderly accordyng
to thoſe daies vnto the people,

as by the bokes thē ſelues
it doth well appeare. And of
ſuch Sermons be yet manye
bookes to be ſeene, partlye
remayning in priuate mens
handes, and taken out from
monaſteryes at their diſſolution:
partlye yet reſerued in the
libraryes of Cathedrall churches,
as of Worceter, Hereford,
and Exeter. From which
places diuerſe of theſe bookes
haue bene deliuered into the
handes of the moſte reuerend
father, Matthewe Archbyſhop
of Canterburye, by whoſe diligent
ſearch for ſuch writings
of hiſtorye, and other monumentes
of antiquitie, as might
reueale vnto vs what hath ben
the ſtate of our church in England
from tyme to tyme, theſe
thynges that bee here made
knowen vnto thee, do come to
lyght. Howe be it the Sermons

were not firſt written in the
olde Saxon tounge: but were
tranſlated into it, as it ſhoulde
appeare, from the Lattyne. For
about the end of a Saxon boke
of lx. Sermons, (which hath aboute
the middeſt of it this
Sermō agaynſt the bodely preſēce)
be added theſe wordes of
the tranſlatour. Fela faegere

We let paſſe many good goſpells,
which he that lyſte may
tranſlate. For we dare not enlarge
thys boke much further,
leſt it be ouer great, & ſo cauſe

to men lothſomnes through
hys bygnes. And in an other
booke contaynyng ſome of
theſe Saxon Sermons it is alſo
thus written in Lattyne.
In hoc codicillo continentur duodecim
ſermones anglice quos accepimus
de libris quos Aelfricus abbas
Anglice tranſtulit. In thys
booke be compryſed xij. Sermons
whche we haue taken
out of the bookes that Aelfricke
abbot tranſlated into
Engliſhe. In which wordes
truelye here is alſo declared
who was the tranſlatour, to
witte, one Aelfricke. And ſo
hee doth confeſſe of hym
ſelf in the preface of his Saxon
grāmer, where he doth moreouer
geue vs to vnderſtand the
number of the Sermons that
he tranſlated thus. Ic AElfric

was deſirous to turne into our
Engliſhe tounge from the arte
of letters called grammer thys
little booke, after that I had
tranſlated the two bookes in
foureſcore Sermons. But how
ſoeuer it be nowe manifeſt enoughe
by thys aboue declared,
how that theſe Sermons
were tranſlated: I thinke notwithſtanding,
that there will
hardlye be found of them any
Lattyne bookes being (I feare
me) vtterlye peryſhed & made
out of the waye ſince the conqueſt
by ſome which coulde
not well broke thys doctrine.
And that ſuch hath bene the

dealing of ſome partiall readers,
may partlye hereof appeare.
There is yet a very aunciēt
boke of Cannons of Worceter
librarye, and is for the
moſt parte all in Latyne, but
yet intermyngled in certayne
places, euē thre or foure leaues
together with the olde Saxon
tounge: and one place of this
booke handleth thys matter
of the ſacrament: but a fewe
lynes, wherin dyd conſiſte the
chiefe poynte of the cōtrouerſie,
be raſed out by ſome reader:
yet conſider how the corruption
of hym, whoſoeuer he
was, is bewrayed. This part of
the Lattyne booke was taken
out of ij. epiſtles of Aelfrike
before named, & were written
of hym aſwell in the Saxon
tounge, as the Lattyne. The
Saxon epiſtles be yet wholie to
be had in the librarye of the

ſame church, in a boke written
all in Saxon, and is intituled, a
boke of Cānons, & ſhrift boke.
But in the Church of Exeter,
theſe epiſtles be ſeene both in
the Saxon tounge, and alſo in
the Lattyne. By the which it
ſhall be eaſie for any to reſtore
agayne, not onely the ſenſe of
the place raſed in Worceter
booke, but alſo the very ſame
Lattyn wordes. And the words
of theſe two epiſtles, ſo much
as concerne the ſacramentall
bread & wyne, we here ſet immediatlye
after the Sermon:
fyrſt in Saxon, then the words
of the ſecond epiſtle we ſet alſo
in Lattyne: deliuering them
moſt faythfully as they are to
be ſeene in the bookes from
whence they are taken. And as
touching the Saxon writings,
they be ſet out in ſuch forme
of letters, and darke ſpeech, as

was vſed, whē they were written:
tranſlated alſo for our
better vnderſtanding, into our
common, and vſuall Engliſhe
ſpeech. But nowe it remayneth
we do make knowen who
thys Aelfricke was, whom we
here ſpeake of, in what age he
liued, and in what eſtimation.
He was truely brought vp in
the ſcholes of Aethelwolde byſhop
of Wincheſter, Aethelwolde
I meane the elder, and
greate ſaincte of Wincheſter
church: So canoniſed becauſe
in the dayes of Edgar kyng of
England, he conſpyred with
Dunſtane Archbyſhop of Canterburie,
& Oſwalde biſhop of
Worceter, to expell out of the
Cathedrall churches, through
out all England the maryed
prieſtes, which then were in
thoſe churches the olde dwellers,
as wryteth Ranulphus Ceſtrencis
               
in hys pollicronicon
and to ſet vp of newe the religion
or rather ſuperſtition &
hipocriſie of monkes, after
that the ſame had been a longe
tyme, by the iuſte iudgement
of God, vtterlye aboliſhed, the
Danes ſpoyling them, & cruelly
burning them vp in there
houſes, as is at large, and plentifullye
confeſſed in the hiſtoryes
of their owne churches.
For thys newe rearing vp of
monkerie is Aethelwolde called
in moſte olde hiſtoryes,
pater monachorum, the father of
monkes. Vnder thys Aethelwolde
was Aelfrike traded vp
in lerning, as he witneſſeth of
him ſelfe in the Lattyne preface
of his Saxon grammer,
where ſpeaking of hys interpretation
of Lattyne wordes
he wryteth thus. Scio multis
modis verba poſse interpret
                     •
                  ri, ſed

ego ſimplicem interpretationem ſequor,
faſtidiū vitādi cauſa. Si alicui
tamen diſplicuerit noſtra interpretatio,
dicat quomodo vult. Nos con
tenti ſumus ſicut didicimus in ſcholis
venerabilis praeſulis Aethelwoldi
qui multos ad bonum imbuit. I
know that wordes may be expounded
diuers waies, but for
to auoyde lothſomnes I doe
follow the playne interpretation.
Which if anye ſhall miſlike
he may do as he thinketh beſt:
but we are cōtent to ſpeake, as
we haue learned in the ſcholes
of the moſte worthye byſhop
Aethelwolde, who hath bene a
good inſtructour to manye, or
who hath brought vp many to
good. This he writeth of hymſelfe.
So vppon this his education
in the ſchooles of Aethelwolde
he became afterward to
be an earneſt louer and a great
ſetter forwarde of monkerye,

and therefore no leſſe buſie
writer and ſpeaker agaynſt the
matrimonye of prieſtes in hys
tyme. For which reſpecte he
was afterwarde ſo regarded,
that he was made by Oſwalde
byſhop of Worceter (as reporteth
John Capgraue) the firſt abbot
of S. Albons newlye reſtored,
& repleniſhed with mōkes,
and was alſo made abbot of
Malmeſburye by kyng Edgar,
(as reporteth William of Malmeſburye)
in the lyfe of Aldelmus.
And truly he calleth him
ſelfe abbot in diuers of his epiſtles,
although he neuer named
of what place, as in that
he wryteth Egneſh amenſibus fratribus
de conſuetudine monachorum.
To the monkes of Egneſham,
of the order and manner
of monkes, and in this
he wryteth here to Wulfſtane
Archbyſhop of Yorke, and in

an other agaynſt prieſtes matrimonye
ſent to one Sygeferth,
with whom was an anker
abyding, which defended the
mariage of priſtes, affyrming it
to be lawful. The epiſtle beginneth
thus in the Saxon tonge.
Aelfric abb. gret Sigeferþ
freondlice; Me is gesaed ꝧ
ðu saedest beo me ꝧ ic oþer
taehte on Engliscen geƿriten.
oþer eoƿer ancor aet

ðe he sƿutelice saegþ ꝧ hit

That is, Elfricke abbot doth
ſend frendlye ſalutation to Sigeferth.
It is tolde me that I
teach otherwyſe in my Engliſh

writynges, thē doth thy anker
teach, which is at home wyth
thee. For he ſayth playnly that
it is a lawfull thing for a prieſt
to marye, and my wrytynges
doth ſpeake agaynſt thys. &c.
Thus aſwell in hys owne epiſtles,
as in all other bookes of
Sermons in the Saxon tounge,
that I haue ſene, I finde him alwaies
called abbot, and onely
ſo called. Howbeit, John Capgraue
who gathered together
into one volume, the liues of
Engliſh ſainctes, writeth in the
life of Oſwalde, that Aelfricke
was laſte of all aduaunced to
the Archbiſhops ſee of Canterburie.
In alijs inquit Angliae
partibus inſignes eccleſias ob praefixam
cauſam clericis euacuauit, et
eas viris monaſticae inſtitutionis
ſublimauit: quorū haec nomina ſunt.
Eccleſia S. Albani, S. Aetheldredae
virginis in Eli et ea quae apud

Beamfledam conſtituta honorabilis
habebatur. Inſtituit enim in eccleſia
S. Albani Aelfricū abbatē, qui
ad Archiepiſcopatum Cantuarienſem
poſtea ſublimatus fuit. In other
partes of Englande Oſwald
auoyded out of the moſt
notable churches the clarkes,
& aduaunced the ſame places
with men of the order of
monkes, whoſe names be theſe
S. Albons, the church of the
virgin S. Aetheldrede in Ely,
and that which is at Beamfleot
reputed very famous. He dyd
appoynte abbot in S. Albons
Aelfricke, who was afterward
promoted to the Archbyſhopricke
of Canterburye. Truely
thys Aelfricke we here ſpeake
of, was equall in tyme toWho dyd put out ſecular prieſtes out of the church of Canterbury, as the ſtory of that houſe ſheweth. Elfricke
Archbyſhop of Canterbury,
as may certainly appeare
to him that will well conſider,
when Wulfſtane Archbiſhop

of Yorke, and Wulfſine byſhop
of Scyrburne liued, vnto
whom Aelfricke wryteth the
Saxon epiſtles, from which the
wordes concerning the Sacrament
hereafter following be
taken. And the certaintye of
thys conſideration, may well
be had out of William Malmeſburye
De Pontificibus, & out
of the ſubſcription of biſhops,
to the grauntes, letters patentes,
and charters of Aethelrede,Theſe charters are to be ſene.
who raigned king of
Englād at this time. Howbeit
whether this Aelfricke, & Aelfricke
Archb. of Canterbury
was but one, & the ſame mā, I
leaue it to other mens iudgement
further to conſider: for
that writing here to Wulfſtane,
he nameth him ſelfe but
abbot, & yet Aelfricke Archb.
of Canterbury, was promoted
to that his archb. ſtole vj. yeres

before that Wulfſtane was
made Archbiſhop of Yorke, as
is declared moſt manifeſtly in
the hiſtoryes of Symeon of Durham,
Roger Houeden, the hiſtorie
of Rocheſter, Flores Hyſtoriarum,
Thomas Stubbes in hys
hiſtorie of the Archbiſhops of
Yorke, and in all other moſte
auncient hiſtories, aſwell written
in the olde Saxon tounge,
as in Lattyne: Moreouer in
many deedes and writynges of
giftes, made by kyng Aethelrede,
when Aelfricke ſubſcribeth
as Archbyſhop of Canterburye,
then in them is one
Aldulphus, Wulfſtanes predeceſſour,
named Archbyſhop of
Yorke, and Wulfſtane him ſelf
ſubſcribeth but as an inferiour
byſhop. But be it, that this
Aelfricke was onely abbot, and
not Archbiſhop of Canterburye,
yet this is alſo moſt true,

that beſide the prayſe of great
learning, & of being a moſt eloquēt
interpreter (for which
William of Malmeſburye doth
greatly commend him) he was
alſo of ſuch credite and eſtimation
to the lyking of that
age in which he liued, that all
his writinges, and chiefly theſe
his epiſtles, were then thought
to contayne ſounde doctrine:
and the byſhops them ſelues
dyd iudge them full of ryghte
good counſaile, preceptes, and
rules to gouerne therby their
clergie: and therfore dyd moſt
earneſtly requeſt to haue theſe
epiſtles ſent vnto them, as doe
well appeare by ij. ſhorte Lattyne
epiſtles, ſet before the
Saxon epiſtles, wherof the one
is ſent to Wulfſine byſhop of
Scyrburne, the other to Wulfſtane
Archbyſhop of Yorke.
And after this alſo byſhops of

other churches amonge other
cānons that they collected out
of generall & perticular councells,
out of the bookes of
Gildas, out of the poenitentialls
of Theodorus Archbyſhop
of Canterburye, out of the extractes
of Egberhtus the iiij.
Archbiſhop of Yorke frō Paulinus:
out of the epiſtles of
Alcuinus teacher to Charles
the great, and to conclude, out
of the writinges of the fathers
of the primatiue church: amonge
other Cannons I ſaye,
they collected together for the
better orderyng of their churches,
they doe place amonge
them alſo theſe two epiſtles of
Aelfricke, as is to be ſene in ij.
bokes of Cānons of Worceter
librarye: wherof the one is all
in the olde Saxon tounge, and
there theſe epiſtles of Aelfricke
be in the ſame tounge: the other

is for the moſt parte all in
Lattyne, and is intituled Admonitio
ſpiritualis doctrinae, where
theſe epiſtles be in the Lattyne
tounge, and be ioyned together
for an exhortation to be
made of the byſhop to hys
clergie. There is alſo a like
booke of Cannons of Exeter
church, where theſe two epiſtles
in Lattyne be appoynted
in ſtede of two ſermons to bee
preached, Ad clericos et preſbyteros,
to the clerkes and prieſtes,
and the epiſtles be alſo in the
ſame boke in the Saxon tonge.
And thys booke was geuen to
Sainct Peters church in Exeter
by Leofricke the firſt and moſt
famous biſhop of that church,
as in hys owne recorde and
graūt of all ſuch landes, bokes,
and other thinges he gaue vnto
the church, it is thus expreſſed
in the Saxon tounge.

is, that is, that he hath gotte in
agayne through Gods helpe,
what ſoeuer was takē out: & ſo

of ſuch as was taken from the
church he recouered agayne,
partlye by his earneſt complaynte,
and ſute made for the
ſame, partlye by his geuyng of

rewardes. Nexte making alſo
report what landes with other
treaſure of his own he gaue of
newe to the place: he commeth
at laſte to the rehearſall
of hys bookes, wherof the laſt
here named a Cannon on Leden
& scrift boc on Englisc.
that is, a Cannon boke in Lattyne
and ſhryfte boke in Engliſhe,
is the boke we ſpeake of,
and hath in it the Lattyne and
Saxon epiſtles of Aelfricke.
Thus as this boke of Exeter
church hath thys good euidence
by which it is ſhewed,
that Leofrike was the geuer
therof: euen ſo the boke of
Cānons of Worceter church,
written all in Saxon, hath in it
moſt certayne teſtimonie that
the writer therof was the publike
ſcribe of the church whoſe
name was Wulfgeat. For thus

thys cōtrouerſie, but alſo, that
more is, what was the cōmon
receaued doctrine herein of
the whole church of England,
as well when Aelfricke hym ſelf
lyued, as before hys tyme, and
alſo after his time, euē frō him
to the conqueſt. But what was
the condition and ſtate of the
church, whē Aelfricke him ſelf
liued? In deede to confeſſe the
truth, it was in diuers pointes
of Religion full of blindnes
and ignoraunce: full of childyſh
ſeruitude to ceremonies,
as it was longe before and after:
and to much geuen to the
loue of monketye, which now
at thys tyme vnmeaſurablye
tooke roote, and grewe exceſſiuely.
But yet to ſpeake what
the aduerſaryes of the truth
haue iudged of thys time, it is
moſt certayne, that there is no
age of the church of England,

which they haue more reuerenced,
and thought more holy
then thys. For of what age
haue they canonized vnto vs
more ſainctes and to their lyking
more notable? Fyrſt Odo
Archbyſhop of Canteaburye,
who dyed in the beginning of
king Edgars raigne. Then king
Edgar hym ſelfe, by whom
Aelfricke was made abbot of
Malmeſburye. Then Edward
called the Martyr kyng Edgars
baſtard ſonne. Then Editha
kyng Edgars baſtarde
daughter. Alſo Dunſtane archbyſhop
of Canterbury, of whō
Aelfricke was greatly eſtemed.
Aethelwold biſhop of Wincheſter,
vnder whom Aelfricke had
hys firſt bringing vp. Oſwalde
byſhop of Worceter, and after
Archbyſhop of Yorke, who
made Aelfricke abbot of S. Albons.
Wulfſine biſhop of Scyrburne

vnto whom Aelfricke
wryteth the firſt of the epiſtles
we here ſpeake of. Elfleda a
Nunne of Romeſey, and Wulhilda
Abbeſſe of Barkyng, lyued
in the dayes of king Edgar.
And laſte of all Wlfritha
K. Edgars cōcubyne. All theſe
I ſay with ſome other more, be
canonized for ſainctes of this
age in which Aelfricke him ſelf
liued in great fame & credite.
Alſo Leofricke and Wulfſine,
whom we haue ſhewed to haue
been the geuers of thoſe Cannon
bookes wherin be ſeene
Aelfrickes epiſtles be reuerenced
for moſte holy men and
ſaintes of their churches. And
theſe ij. liued byſhops in the
comming in of the Conquerour.
Thus doe ſome men
now a dayes not onely diſſent
in doctrine from their owne
church, but alſo from that age

of their churche whiche they
haue thought moſte holy, and
iudged a moſt excellēt paterne
to be folowed. Wherfore what
may we nowe thinke of that
great cōſent, wherof the Romaniſtes
haue long made vaunte,
to witte, their doctrine to
haue cōtinued many hundred
yeares as it were lincked together
with a continuall chaine,
wherof hath been no breche
at any time. Truely this their
ſo great affirmation hath vttered
vnto vs no truth, as good
chriſtian reader thou mayeſt
well iudge by dulye weighing
of this which hath been ſpoken,
and by the reading alſo
of that which here followeth,
wherunto I now leaue thee.
            Truſting that after thou haſt

God badde Moyſes

his captaine in ye land of Aegypt,
to commaunde ye people
of Iſraell to take for euery

out of ye countrey to

yt lambe to God, & after to

afterward to eate ye lambes

ſayth vnto Moyſes. Eate of ye
lābe nothing raw, nor ſoddē
in water, but roſted wt fire.

Eate ye head, ye feete, and the
inwardes, & let nothing of
it be left vntill ye morning: if
any thing therof remaine, yt

it in this wyſe. Gyrde your

This time is ye lordes paſseouer.
And ther was ſlain on yt

of Iſraell were deliuered frō

holde it a greate feaſt in

feaſte. After thys deede
God ledde the people of Iſraell
ouer ye redde ſea, wt dry

Pharao, & al his army together
wt their poſseſsions, &
fedde afterward ye Iſraelits

He is called bread,

The Iſraelites did eate the
lambes fleſhe as God commaunded
wyth vnleuened
bread; and wylde lettiſſe:
How we ſhoulde come to the holy cōmunion. ſo we ſhould receyue yt holy
houſell of Chriſtes bodye
and bloud without the leauen

of ſinne, and iniquitie.
As leauen turneth the creatures
from their nature: ſo
doth ſinne alſo chaunge the
nature of man from innocencye
to foules ſpottes of
giltineſſe. The apoſtle hath
taught how we ſhould feaſt
not in the leauen of euelneſſe
but in the ſwete dough
of puritie and truthe. The
her be whiche they ſhoulde
eate with the vnleauened
bread is called Lettiſſe,
and is bitter in taſte. So
we ſhoulde with bitterneſſe
of vnfayned weepinge
purifye our mynde,

if we wil eat Chriſtes bodye.
Thoſe Iſraelites were not
wont to eate rawe fleſhe although
god forbad them to
eate it rawe, and ſodden in
water, but roſted wyth
fyer. He ſhall receyue the
bodye of God rawe that ſhal
thynke wythout reaſon that
Chriſt was onelye man lyke
vnto vs and was not God.
And 
                     •
                  e that wil after mans
wiſedome ſearch of ye myſterye
of Chriſtes incarnation,
doth lyke vnto hym yt doth
ſeeth lambes fleſh in water:
bycauſe that water in thys
ſame place ſignifieth mans

vnderſtāding: but we ſhould
vnderſtād that al the miſterie
of Chriſts humanity was
ordered by ye power of ye holy
ghoſt. And thē eate we his
body roſted wyth fyre: becauſe
the holy ghoſt came in
fyrye lykenes to the apoſtles
in diuerſe tonges. The Iſraelites
ſhould eate the lambs
head, & ye fete, and ye purtenaunce:
and nothing therof
muſte be left ouer night, Yf
any thing therof were lefte,
they did burne yt in the fyre:
and they brake not ye bones.
After ghoſtlye vnderſtandinge
we doe then eate the

lambes head, when we take
hold of Chriſtes diuinitye in
our beliefe. Agayn when we
take holde of hys humanyte,
wyth loue then eate we the
lambes feete: bycauſe that
Chriſt is the beginnyng and
ende, god before all world
and man in the ende of thys
worlde. VVhat bee the
lābes purtenaūce, but Chriſtes
ſecrete preceptes, and
theſe we eat, whē we receiue
with gredines the worde of
lyfe. There muſte nothing
of the lābe be left vnto the
morning, bicauſe yt all godes
ſayings are to be ſearched wt
                  
great carefulneſſe: ſo that
all his preceptes maye be
knowen in vnderſtāding &
deede in the nyght of thys
preſent lyfe, before that the
laſt day of the vniuerſall reſurrection
do appeare. If we
can not ſearch out throughly
all the miſtery of Chriſtes
incarnation, then ought we
to betake the reſt vnto the
might of ye holy ghoſt wt true
humilitie: & not to ſearche
raſhlye of that deepe ſecretnes
aboue ye meaſure of our
vnderſtāding. They did eat
ye lambes fleſh wt their loynes
gyrt. In the loines is the luſt

of the body. And he whyche
wyll receyue yt houſell, ſhall
reſtrayne that concupiſcēce:
and take with chaſtitie that
holy receypt. They were alſo
ſhod. VVhat be ſhoes but
of the hydes of dead beaſtes.
VVe be truely ſhod if we folow
in our ſteps & deades
the lyfe of thoſe pilgrimes,
which pleaſe god wt keping
of his commaūdemēts. They
had ſtaues in their handes
when they ate. This ſtafe ſignifieth
a carefulnes and a diligēt
ouerſeing. And al they,
yt beſt know and cā, ſhould
take care of other men,

and ſtaye them vppe with
their helpe. It was inioyned
to the eaters yt they ſhoulde
eate the lambe in haſte. For
god abhorreth ſlouthfulnes
in his ſeruantes. And thoſe
he loueth that ſeeke the
ioye of euerlaſting life with
quicknes, & haſt of minde.
It is written: Prolong not to
turne vnto god, leſt the time
paſſe awaye through thy
ſlowe tarrying. The eaters
mought not break the lābes
bones. Nomore mought the
ſouldyers, yt did hang Chriſt
breake his holy legges, as
they did of the two theefes

that hanged on either ſyde
of him. And ye Lord roſe frō
death ſound without al corruption:
& at the laſt iudgemēt
they ſhal ſee him, whom
they did moſt cruelly hange
on ye croſſe. This time is called
in ye Ebrue tonge Paſca,
and in latine Tranſitus, & in
Engliſh a Paſſouer: bicauſe yt
on this daye the people of Iſraell
paſſed from the land of
Aegipt ouer the read ſea:
from bondage to the lande
of promyſe. So alſo dyd
our Lord at thys tyme departe
as ſayeth Iohn the
Euangelyſte from thys

world to his heauēly father.
Euen ſo we ought to folowe
our head, and to go from the
deuill to chriſt: from this vnſtable
world to his ſtable
kingdōe. Howbeit we ſhould
firſt in this preſēt life depart
frō vice to holy vertue:
from euill manners to good
manners, if we will after
thys lente lyfe go to that eternal
life, & after our reſurrection
to Chriſt. He
bring vs to his euerliuing father,
who gaue him to death
for our ſinnes. To him be honour,
& praiſe of wel doing,
world wythout ende. Amen.

                  SOme priſtes keepe
the houſell that is
hallowed on Eaſter
day all the yere for ſyke
men. But they doe greatlye
amyſſe, bycauſe it waxeth
horye. And theſe will
not vnderſtand how greuous
penaunce the poenitentiall
booke teacheth by
thys, if the houſell become
hory and rotten: or yf it be
loſt: or be eaten of miſe or of
beaſtes by neglygence. Men
ſhal reſerue more carefullye
that holy houſell, and not
reſerue it to longe, but
hallowe other of newe for

ſyckemen alwayes wythin a
weke or a fortnight that it
be not ſomuch as horye. For
ſo holy is the houſell whych
to day is hallowed as that
whyche on Eaſter daye
was hallowed. That houſell
is Chriſtes bodye not
bodylye, but ghoſtlye. Not
the bodye whyche he ſuffred
in, but the bodye of
which hee ſpake, when he
bleſſed bread and wyne to
houſel a night before his ſuffring,
& ſayd by the bleſſed
bread thys is my bodye, &
agayne by the holye wyne
thys is my bloude, whiche is

ſhede for manye in forgeuenes
of ſinnes. vnderſtand
nowe that the lord, who
could turne yt bread before
his ſuffring to his body, and
yt wyne to his bloude ghoſtlye:
that the ſelfe ſame lorde
bleſſeth dayly throughe the
prieſtes handes bread and
wine to his ghoſtly body, and
to his ghoſtly bloud.
               Here thou ſeeſt good reader
how Aelfrike vpon fynding fault
wyth an abuſe of his tyme whiche
was that prieſts on Eaſter day filled
their houſell boxe, and ſo kept
the bread a whole yere for ſickmen,
toke an occaſion to ſpeake agaynſt
the bodely preſence of Chriſt in the
s;acramēt. So alſo in an other epiſtle
ſent to Wulfſtane Archbyſhop of
York, he reprehending agayne thys
ouerlong reſeruing of the houſell addeth
alſo wordes more at large againſt
the ſame bodely preſence. His
wordes be theſe.
               
                  
SOme prieſts fil their boxe
for houſel on Eaſter day,
& ſo reſerue it a whole yere
for ſicke mē, as though that
houſel were more holy thē any
other. But they do vnaduiſedlye,
bicauſe it waxeth
black: or al together rotlē by
keping it ſo long ſpace. And
thus is he become giltie as ye
boke wytneſſeth to vs. Yf anye
do keepe the houſell to
long, or loſe it, or myſe or other
beaſtes do eate it, ſee
what ye paenitential boke ſayeth
by this. So holy is altogether
that houſell, whiche is
hallowed to daye, as that

which is hallowed on Eaſter
day. VVherfore I beſech
you to kepe that holy bodye
of Chriſt with more aduiſement
for ſick men from ſonday
to ſondaye in a verye
cleane boxe: or at the moſt
not to kepe it aboue a fortnight,
and then eate it laying
other in the place. VVe
haue an example hereof in
Moyſes bookes, as god him
ſelfe hath commaunded in
Moyſes lawe. How the
prieſtes ſhould ſet on euery
ſaturnday twelue loaues all
newe baked vpon the tabernacle:
the whiche were called

panes prepoſitionis: and
thoſe ſhoulde ſtād there on
gods tabernacle, til ye next ſaturnday,
& the did ye priſtes
thē ſelues eate them, & ſet
other in ye place. Sōe prieſtes
wil not eate ye houſell, which
they do hallow. But we will
now declare vnto you how ye
boke ſpeaketh by thē. Preſbyter
miſſā celebrans, et non
audens ſumere ſacrificium, accuſante
cōſciētia ſua, anathema
eſt. The prieſt that doth
ſaye maſſe and dare not eate
thē houſell, hys conſcience
accuſynge hym, is accurſed.
It is leſſe daunger to

receyue ye houſell, thē to hallowe
it. He yt doth twyſe
hallowe one hoſt to houſell,
is lyke vnto thoſe heretikes,
who do chriſten twyſe
one childe. Chriſt himſelfe
bleſſed houſel before his ſuffring:
he bleſſed ye bread and
brake thus ſpeaking to hisa
poſtels. Eate this bread it is
my body. And agayne he bleſſed
one chalice wt wyne and
thus alſo ſpeaketh vnto thē.
Drinke ye all of this it is
myne owne bloud of ye newe
teſtament which is ſhed for
many in forgeuenes of ſynnes.
The lord which halowed

houſel before his ſuffering
& ſayeth yt ye bread was his
owne body & yt ye wyne was
truly his bloud, he haloweth
dayly by ye hādes of ye priſt
bread to his body, & wyne
to his bloud in ghoſtly myſtery,
as we read in bokes. And
yet yt liuely bread is not bodely
ſo notwithſtāding: not
ye ſelf ſame body yt Chriſt ſuffered
in. Nor yt holy wine is
ye ſauiours bloud which was
ſhed for vs in bodely thing:
but in ghoſtly vnderſtanding.
Both be truly yt bread
hys body, and yt wyne alſo
hys bloud, as was ye heauenly

bread, which we call Manna,
that fed forty yeres gods
people. And ye cleare water
which did then runne from
the ſtone in the wildernes,
was truly his bloud, as Paul
wrote one ſumme of his epiſtles.
Omnes patres noſtri eandem eſcam ſpiritualem manducauerunt,
et omnes eundem
potum ſpiritualē biberunt, &c.
All our fathers ate in the
wildernes the ſame ghoſtlye
meate, and dranke the ſame
ghoſtly drinke. They dranke
of yt goſtly ſtone, and yt ſtone
was chriſt. The apoſtle hath
ſaid as you now haue heard,

that they all did eate ye ſame
ghoſtly meate, and they all
did drinke the ſame ghoſtly
drinke. And he ſayth not bodely
but ghoſtly. And Chriſt
was not yet borne, nor hys
bloud ſhedde, when that the
people of Iſraell ate yt meat,
and drank of that ſtone. And
the ſtone was not bodelye
Chriſt though he ſo ſayd. It
was the ſame miſtery in the
olde law, and they did ghoſtlye
ſignifie yt ghoſtly houſell
of our ſauioures body which
we conſecrate now.
            
            
               
                  
                     
This Epiſtle to VVulfſtane
Elfrike wrote firſt in the Latyne

ſet before this, and one other of
hys Saxon Epiſtles he confeſſeth
thus. Aelfricus abbas VVulfſtano
venerabili archiepiſcopo

veſtrae almitatis iuſsionibus
tranſferentes Anglice duas
epiſtolas quas Latino eloquio
deſcriptas ante annum vobis

haue obeyed the commaundement
of thy excellencie in tranſlating
into Engliſhe the two Epiſtles
which we ſent vnto thee
writtē in Latine more then a yeare
agoe. Howbeit we keepe not here alwayes

of that time, wherin Elfrike liued)
and for that alſo it maye be that
ſome will doubt how ſkilfullye, and
alſo faithfullye theſe wordes of Elfrike

               AS the writynges of the fathers
euen of the firſt age
of the Churche bee not
thought on all partes ſo perfect, that
whatſoeuer thyng hath beene of thē
ſpoken ought to be receaued without
all exceptiō (which honour truelye
them ſelues both knewe and alſo
haue confeſſed to be onely due to the
moſt holy and tryed word of God:)
So in this Sermon here publiſhed
ſome thynges be spoken not conſonant
to ſounde doctrine: but rather
to ſuch corruption of greate ignoraunce
& ſuperſtition, as hath taken
roote in the church of lōg time, being
ouermuch cumbred with monckery.
As where it ſpeaketh of the maſſe
to be profitable to the quicke and
dead: of the mixture of water with
wyne: and wheras here is alſo made
reporte of ii. vayne miracles, which
notwithſtanding ſeeme to haue been
infarced for that they ſtand in their

place vnaptly, and without purpoſe,
and the matter without them, both
before & after, doth hange in it ſelfe
together most orderly: with ſome other
ſuſpitious wordes ſoūding to ſuperſtitiō.
But all theſe things that be
thus of ſome reprehenſiō be as it wer
but by the way touched: the full and
whole diſcourſe of all the former part
of the Sermō, & almoſt of the whole
Sermon is about the vnderſtanding
of the Sacramentall bread & wine
howe it is the bodye and bloude of
Chriſt our Sauiour, by which is reuealed
& made knowen, what hath
beene the common taught doctrine
of the church of England on this behalfe
many hundreth yeares agoe,
contrarye vnto the vnaduiſed writyng
of ſome nowe a dayes. Nowe
that thys foreſayd Saxon Homely
with the other teſtimonies before alleadged,
doe fullye agree to the olde
auncient bookes (whereof ſome bee
written in the olde Saxon, and ſome

in the Lattyne) from whence they
are taken: theſe here vnder written
vpon diligent peruſing, & comparing
the ſame haue found by conference,
that they are truelye put
forth in Print without any adding,
or withdrawing any thyng for the
more faithfull reporting of the ſame,
and therefore for the better credite
hereof haue ſubſcribed their names.

teache the people of God
the Lordes prayer, and
the articles of their beliefe
in the Engliſhe tounge wherby
they mought the better ſerue their
God, and holde faſte their profeſſion
of Chriſtianitie: may well be proued
by many godly decrees of byſhops,
and lawes of kinges made frō
tyme to tyme in the raigne of the
Saxons, before the Conqueſt. In a
councell holden by Cuthbert Archbyſhop
of Canterburye, in the yeare
of our Lorde. 747. and in the 33.
yeare of Aethelbalde king of Mercia
(who was preſent at this ſame
Councell with his princes & dukes)

That the prieſtes doe both
learne them ſelues and alſo teach to
others the Lordes prayer and the
Creede in Engliſhe. In olde Cannon

bookes of churches, & in the epiſtles
of Aelfricke we read it thus inioyned
to prieſtes. Se maesse preost

Chriſtian men do learne to know at

aright to vnderſtand: and learne the
Pater noſter, and the Creede. For
that with the one euery Chriſtian
man ſhall pray vnto God, and with

Thus is it reſerued in memorie,
& put in writing, as touching the
diligent care that the former age of
the church of God bad to haue the
people of God wel inſtructed in that
prayer, wherof Chriſt him ſelf is the
author, and in the articles of their
beliefe. Which prayer of the Lord,

and Creede with the tenne lawlyke

But for the better vnderſtanding

               Theſe cōmaundementes we haue taken from the lawes of Alfrede
the king, before which they are alwaies placed: but here the maner of
speaking in the ſcripture is ſomewhat chaunged, and that more is,
here is lefte out theſe wordes. (Non facies ſculptile ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      omnem ſimilitudinem
quae eſt in coelo deſuper, & quae eſt in terra deorſum,
nec eorum quae ſunt in aquis ſub terra: non adorabis
ne

not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image,
nor the likenes of any thing
that is in heauen aboue, or in the
earth beneath, or in the water vnder
the earth. Thou ſhalt not bowe
downe to them nor worſhip them.
For I thy Lord. &c.) Which thyng
is done in all copyes of Alfredes
lawes written in the Saxon tounge:
and not onely in them but in many
other bookes as hath been ſeene eyther
Saxon, or Lattyne intreatyng
of the commaundementes, which
were written before the Conqueſt,
and ſince the ſecond Nicene councell,
wherin was decreed the worſhipping
of Images. See what followed
of taking away frō the worde
of God contrarye to the expreſſe cō
                  maundement
of the ſame vpon the
vngodly decree of that coūcell. Whē
this thing was eſpied by them that
tranſlated theſe lawes into the Lattyne
tounge ſone after the conqueſt,
theſe wordes were reſtored agayne

by the trāſlatours to their due place,
as by the Lattyne bookes of the
lawes it is to be ſeene. But bicauſe
we haue made mention of that
ſecond Nicene councell whiche
decreed both of the hauing and
worſhipping of Images, we ſhall
here brieflye ſhewe what our ſtories
report, was thought of the ſame coū
                  cell
