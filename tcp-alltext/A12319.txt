            Illustrissimo, Eximiaeque spei, CAROLO Principi.
            Next great'st, though not chiefe Mourner, for her sexe,
            It cannot be, but that your Grace should be;
            Me though the meanest, so much her losse affects,
            That I thus plaine in mournfull Elegie,
            T'whom rather now, than your selfe should I flie?
            Dayne then for her sake, that the like long since
            Daynde, to protect me and my lines, faire Prince.
         
         
            
            
               
                  ❧ To the thrice high and puissant Prince, King IAMES.
            
            
               With curious eye, view not these Pourtraitures;
               I haue (deare Liege) your losse, limm'd, shadowed thus.
               Let but my loue, which me of grace assures
               Leaue thus farre forth obtaine, that Zoilus
               
               In person of Apelles iudge not this:
               AM I a Zeuxis, true colours not to misse?

               Liuing in Athens subtile temperate ayre,
               Affoord diuiner poesies, heauenlier fits.
               True, Royall Lord. Rude rythmes with vs are rare:
               Your Highnesse though t'accept what Mantua offers,
               ARmour of proofe t'will be gainst enuious scoffers.

            In most melodious sort, to heauens supernall King,
            Where then in happiest heauenly state, my poore heart scarce can skan,
            O may I liue, when rapt by Fate, where Glories crowne Queene Anne.
