I haue looked vpon al the thynges vnder the ſunne, and haue founde none other but vanity. Onely reſerued the Image of God in vs, beyng the ſpirit that ſuſteyneth not the natural lyfe alone, but alſo al the holy and vertuous thoughts, which God hath created immortal vnto his own likenes, as thou maieſt wel parceyue, if thou conſider the ſubſtaunce of the natural body, that hauyng the ſpirit is al liuely, & not only moueth ech finger hand, foote, eye & toung materially, but alſo wyth the thoughte penetrateth the heauens, and in maner conceiueth a ſubſtance in the immortality of Gods euerlaſtyng kyngdom, and wanting the ſpirite, reſteth dead priuate of al thoſe vertues, though wel thou ſhalt ſe that it lacketh nether hand, foote, eye, tunge nor other member.

               ¶The firſt Sermon.
               What thynge God is.
               
                  IGnoraunce ſpecially of the heauenly thinges, is the greateſt lack that cā be in man, and aboue all other the ignoraunce or lacke of knowledge of god. For as it is impoſſible to attaine the ſcience of Philoſophye, Aſtrologie, Geometry or of any other like, without the ground or fyrſt principals. So without the knowledge of God the true be ginnyng and princypall of true deuynitie is impoſſible to haue any lyght of the truth neceſſary & proffitable to the ghoſtly health And lykewiſe, as the knowledge of the firſt principals of one ſcience, depēdeth ye knowledge of all the trouthe and concluſyons that that ſcience conteineth▪ So of the true knowledge of God, dependeth the knowledge of all the circumſtaunces and truthe
 of Theologie or Deuinite. Wherefore ſeing how much peſtiferous and deteſtable the ignoraunce of God is, and how much neceſſary the true knowledge of him is▪ I haue thought it expedient, fyrſt to conſyder what thinge God is.
               It is a moſt eaſy thing to know that god is, or that there is a God, ſithens that there is no Nation, ſo barbarous, but that it beleueth that there is a God, being a general knowledge that God hath ſo imprinted in ye harts of al mē, that if the man haue any iudgement at all, it behoueth him wyth the hart to confeſſe that there is a God. For albeit there haue bene many wicked whiche wyth their mouthes haue ſayde, there is no God. Neuertheles the ſelf ſame, when they haue fallen into any peril or neceſſity, haue bene enforced of that only light and religion of god, to recommend themſelues vnto him, ſo that we muſt of force repute hym a very ydeote,Pſalm. xi
                        •
                     i. that denieth God. And being therfore an euident and eaſy thing to know that there is a God, we muſt now trauayle to know (though it be moſt hard) to knowe what that God is. Many haue bene of opinion that it is impoſſible that we ſhuld imagin what god is, becauſe infiniteli aboue all proporcyons, he excedeth the weakenes
 of our vnderſtanding, ſpecialli becauſe our wittes are drowned in the body, occupyed of fantaſies, & ſhadowed bi y• darke vaines of thinges created, farre of from god. We be weake of ſight, and ſicke and impotente throughe the fall of Adam and oure owne ſynnes. Wherfore they ſay that we cā haue none other knowledge of God, but the negatiue, that is to witte, we may know that God is not material, nor forme imperfecte nor yet ſoule of the worlde, that he is not Earth, Water, Ayre, Fyre, Winde, Sterre Mone, Sonne, Corporal
                     •
                   light nor any vertue ſpred abroade. He is not the beauty that we ſee, the ſwetenes that we taſte, nor other thinge ſenſible, imaginable or intellygyble of vs, but that infinitely he exceadeth al creatures, and althinges that we vnderſtand. In him ther is an inacceſſible lyght ſuch as they, which with theyr thoughtes in maner haue bene rayſed ſo hyghe, that they haue founde what God is, haue deceiued themſelues.Timo. vi And thei who imagin in their minds to haue found God, do fabricate an ydoll, oute of all meaſure dyſtaunt from the true beyng of God,Exodi. xx. as appeareth by his commaundement to the Iewes▪ when he prohibited thē the ſculpture or g
                     •
                  auing of idols, vnderſtanding not of the materyal ydolles
 only, but alſo of the imaginable. For oure wittes are extreme darknes, in comparyſon of gods ineſtimable fyrſt light. So that it behoueth vs with Aaron to enter in Sācta Sanctorum and with Moſes into the celeſtial cloud, if we wil know, that is to ſay, to know yt we know not, in ſuch wyſe y• the more feruentlye a man will profeſſe not to knowe ſo much the better he doth know, & who preſumeth to know, is fartheſt of frō knowledge. And why? becauſe God in hys power aud 
                     •
                  yght ſtandeth ſo hid in darckenes frō vs, that with blyndnes, we ſe hym, with ignoraunce we know him,Pſalme .i. with retyring or with going backe we comprehend him, infleing we find him, with ſcilēce, we prayſe him. And it behoueth hym that wyll know what thyng God is, to ſtudy in the ſchole of ſimplicite and reaſt vāquyſhed of that ineſtimable, in acceſſible and in comprehenſible lyght▪
               
               And I confeſſe that we cannot comprehend God, in ſuch maner as God comprehendeth him ſelf▪ That is to ſay, we cannot haue an infinit knowledge of him, as do the bleſſed ſaintes, that is to ſai, to haue as thei haue the cleare,ſ. Corint. i. naked, opē and viſible ſight of him, to behold him in the fountain of his bryghtnes, face to face in the very being ye
                   he is. But we mai very wel attaine a knowledge what God is though not ſo perfectly as we ſhal know in the other lyfe. Nor it is not poſſible we ſhuld know what thīg god is not, if fyrſt we learne not to know what thing he is, and that his being is ſo perfect that it repugneth y• imperfections of thoſe thynges y• be not. Wherefore cōſidering al y• negatiues y• ar rehearſed of god, ar groū
                  ded vppon one poſptiue and affirmatiue y• we haue, we muſt ſaye of force yt we know God more perfectly, in knowing that that is to be knowen, then in knowing nothinge at al. And therfore ſpeaking of more hygh knowledge affirmatiue, that in this preſent life, the elect communly and without ſpecial priuiledge and miracle had of god, I ſay that fyrſt thou oughteſt to conſider that the creature hath his beinge, although imperfect. And God hath his being without any imperfeccion. Yea his being is infinitely perfect, wherefore to know what thing god is, it behoueth the to do as he doth that wil make an image. Firſt he cutteth of many peces, before he parforme the forme that he deſyreth, and afterwardes paynteth and apparelleth it.
               So is it neceſſarye that with the minde, thou firſt conſider the being of the creature
 And becauſe thou ſhalt fynde hym repleate of imperfeccion, being terminable create, temporal, corruptyble and other like, therfore it behoueth the to clenſe puryfy & take from him al thoſe imperfectyons, and ymagyn him i
                     •
                  finite, interminable, incorruptible and in effect abſtract and lift vp aboue al imperfectiō. Nether yet doth that ſuffice, but alſo it is neceſſary that thou floriſh and adorne him of al perfection poſſible, in ſuch wyſe that thou conceyue to ſee him a terne neceſſary, ſimple, immutable and infinite. Neyther yet doth al that ſuffiſe, but moreouer it behoueth the with thought to puryfy and clenſe of al inperfection the wyl and mynde created, the wyſdom created the iuſtice, bounty, pity, power, charitye, truthe, beauty and al the other vertues and perfections, to which imperfectyon is contrary, and conſequently to enrich him of infinite degrees of perfection, and ſo to behold him in God as a thing purified, to be vnto him diuine and infinite. But becauſe thoſe powers, vertues and operacyons with imperfectyō in maner ruleth in vs, wyl not ſuffer our wittes to conceiue that creature in his being and to clenſe and ſpoyle him of al imperfections, aud ſo to make him infinit, we can not in our being ſe him in God, in whō
                   there can be nothing imperfect, but it muſt ſuffice vs to ſe him in vertue and eminenci. So that albeit in gods proper being ther is the corporal viſion, the imagination, credulitie, opinion, diſcourſes and other actions eſſencially. Neuertheles it muſt ſuffice vs to ſe them in vertue and eminency. For to ſe God clerely it includeth & conteineth all perfection, lyke as the gold conteyneth the perfectyon of all other metals. He then that ſeeth that diuine being with al perfection poſſible, ſeeth what thing God is, becauſe he ſeeth a ſpiritual light, mooſt pure, moſt clere, moſt ſimple and exellently fair, a terne, immutable, neceſſary and infinitely perfect, replete of celeſtial felicite, iuſtice power, bounty, veryte, wiſdom, mercy, charitie and of al the other perfeccions & vertues, infinitely perfect and that in it, in vertue and eminenci be al the colours, odours ſauoures, ſonndes, ſonges, ſwetenes, fairenes, honoures, dignities, treaſures, pleaſures and felicities of the world, infinitely and without proporcion, more perfect then they be of them ſelues here.
               And moreouer it behoueth the to knowe that the being of the creature is a ſhadow & a moſt ſlyght vanite in compariſon of gods being, and the difference more. then is betwene
 our ſhadow and our ſelues.Exod, iii. It is to be ſayde of God, that ſurely he is only the thinge that is. Lykewiſe I ſay of our powers, beauty, truth, charity, iuſtice, wiſdome and of al our other vertues, that compared to the diuine they be as moſt vaine images and ſhadowes infinitely diſtaunt from thē of God. Alſo it behoueth to know, that god is not idel,Ihon, v. but that he continually worketh as (Chriſt ſaith) in ſuch wiſe, that he hathe not only geuē vnto the world his being, but alſo continually conſerueth al the thynges created, and al the vertues, that of al ye miracles and ſtraunge effectes, we knowledg only God to be author and to him we geue al thankes honor and glory. So lykewyſe ought we to knowledge of him al the natural effectes and operacions, and not to extol or praiſe nature but God only, who geueth and preſerueth the being and vertue to all thinges▪ Neither ought there any other chaunce or fortune to be named, but al to be confeſſed of god, and he only to be thanked euen as he continually worketh for vs. And as hys power is neuer ydel, but contynual working in al creatures. So his wyſdome continually ſeeth, diſpoſeth and ordeineth al things moſt beſt, and his boūty lykewiſe continually communicateth vnto vs his benefytes
 and graces. Furthermore it is neceſſary thou know that al that God hath wrought, worketh or ſhal worke in his creatures, is al for man, for whom they be created and preſerued. For al the giftes and benefits that from the beginninge haue bene made or ſhalbe made to the creatures, man is bound to knowledge thē as made to him and accordingly therfore to thancke God▪ And eſpecially the choſen or elect, to whom al creatures do ſerue, both the predeſtinate and reprobate. Yea the aungels and the deuils, euen to the very ſinnes. And becauſe God doth here manifeſt and diſcouer hymſelf, with his omnipotēt wiſdom, truth, iuſtice, bounty and his other vertues and perfectiōs, not onli in his creatures, but much more in his ſcriptures, & eſpecially in chriſt on the croſſe, chefely to them y• by faith conceiue him with ſpirit. Therfore it behoueth him yt wil know what thing God is, to behold him particulerly in Chriſt, & to beſech him to geue him liueli & clere light to know him not only in his creatures, & ſcriptures but ſpecially in Chriſt crucified to the ende that in him & by him, vnderſtāding ye great bounty of God, we may render vnto hym all honoure and glorye by oure Sauyoure Ieſu Chriſt.
               Amen.
            
            
               
               ¶The ſecond Sermon
               Howe to knowe God by hys creatures.
               
                  GOd in his maieſty apparelled with his perfeccions, and in the well of his brightnes (as ſaith Paule) is a certain light inacceſſible and hid.i, Timo. vi. But here he ſome what diſcouereth him ſelfe by hys creatures, as who will enter into Rome muſt of force know bi ye pillers, ſepultures images and bi the great ruines that he ſhal finde there, that the Romains in times paſt hane bene of great power, dominion & wiſdom.Eſay. xv. So he which entereth into this world ſeing this great engine muſt of force know the maker therof to be the God omnipotē, And beholding the order of his creatures muſt not only ſe but alſo maruel at ye wyſdome of God.Pſal. i▪ iii. And with Dauid cry & ſay. Lord thou haſt created al things in wiſdō. And moreouer it behoueth him to ſay that God is beſt, ſeing that continually he dyſpoſeth new gyftes vnto his creatures. And ſeinge that by due meanes he leadeth them to theyr end, he is forced to confes gods deuine prouidence, and ſo in concluſion bi the thinges created, to come to the knowledge of god, & of al hys perfeccions, as far forth
 as they appeare in his creatures, & that becauſe the creatures be vnyted ſo to gethers that eche one hangeth on other, & al of god, in ſuch wiſe that they make a ladder to the vnderſtanding of the natural, by the which they clime and aſcend euen to God. They ſee that this inferyour world, is gouerned of the heauens, and that the heauens keepe their courſes vniformely, by contynual mouing, and therof be conſtrained to conſider that the vertue which moueth them, beyng 
                     •
                  faticable and neuer wery, is ſpiritual, for if it wer corporal, it ſhuld end or at the leaſt waxe weake. And ſo going farther, they cō
                  ſyder that that ſpirytuall vertue, not being the ſupreame, is gouerned bi an other. And becauſe they can not attayne the infinite euerlaſting, they are forced to come to a firſt ſupreame intellygence, the whych moueth wythout beyng moued, and to a fyrſt cauſe independent, and ſo they aſcend to ye knowledge of God. Moreouer, by the beauty of the creatures, they aſcend to the knowledg of the beauty of God. By the order, Armony and conſēt that appear in the creatures they attain the conſyderacion of gods infinite ſapyence or wyſdom. And ſo by the viſyble workes of God (to the regard wherof Dauid calleth vs,Pſaim. lv. ſayinge come and behold
 the workes of the Lord) they attain to conſider the inuiſyble perfeccyons of god, hys euerlaſtyng power and Deuinitie as Paule writeth.Roma. i Ther is no creature ſo bace nor ſo vyle, in whome there ſhineth not the glory of God, in which thou maiſt ſee hys greate power, wyſdome, bounty, beauty & the other perfeccyons. And by how muche the creatures be more noble, hygh, worthy, and excellent,Pſal, viii. by ſo much the more do they diſcouer God. Lyke as the heauens which particulerly do ſhew the glory of God. And the more perfectly we know the creatures. Yea God in them, ſo much the more we ryſe to the knowledge of God, and by ſo much the more our vnderſtandings who ly and wyth perfect light is vnited and copulate vnto hym. It is true that many conſyder the creatures in them ſelues, without reſpect to hym that hath created them, and ſo conſerueth and gouerneth thē. But thoſe are of more groſſe condicion then is y• owl, which, becauſe he can not behold the ſonne, forceth him ſelf and taketh pleaſure to behold hym in the ſterres. Aud they, not ſeing God in hys glory, ſeke not at y• leaſt wiſe, to ſe him in the mirroure of hys creatures.
               But know thou fyrſt that thys ladder of the creatures to clyme vuto God is peryllous,
 becauſe that God hauing put in them a certayne beauty and ſwetenes, to the end that mans vnderſtādyng of the taſte of the ſwete running water ſhuld be prouoked to ſeke the fountayn or ſpryng, and therby to ſeke god with more vehemeucy. Many ſtai or rather fixe them ſelues in the degres, and neuer arriue to the heygth.
               And ſome of the ſight of the beauty created, fall into vyle, baſe, vncleane and fylthy thoughtes. And other ſwell in pryde of that theyr vayn ſcience, without climing to taſt the ſwetenes of gods bounty, fyxe them ſelues in the degrees, & ther ſhew them ſelues contented for reward to be ſene and reputed for learned, of the blinde folyſh and frā 
                  
                     •
                  yke world.
               Furthermore, this ladder is very hard & imperfect becauſe that by the ſinne of our fyrſt parentes we are ſo blynded of ſyght, that wyth great difficulty we may ſe god in the darkenes of things created, ſpecyallye becauſe the wyſe of the world, couetyng to ſearch al the properties, vertues and qualityes of the creatures, haue entangled them ſelues with their curious thoughtes to the vayn ſhadowes of the world, that fyrſt thei are attrapped of death or euer they are a little eleuated their mindes towardes God.
               
                   It is alſo a very lōg ladder, for the great diſtaunce that is betwene the low ſenſyble creatures (at the which, as at the fyrſt ſtep or degree it behoueth to begynne to clyme) and God▪ For it requireth extreme labour to aryſe to the knowledge of the materyall ſubſtaunces, and much more then to clyme with the thought to the knowledg of the in material. And when thou art arriued at the perfect knowledge of ye ſupreame creature becauſe betwene that and God there is infinite diſtaunce, before that with y• thought thou arriue at God, thy wits ſhalbe in mā
                  ner ſo weakened that in the end thou ſhalte attayn none other but a weake, inperfect & darke concept. Therfore to haue ſuffycient light of God to the knowledge of him by y• creatures, ſuffiſeth not to our ſaluacyon▪
               
               For though wythal natural lyght we did arryue by the creatures at the knowledg of God, yet cā we be none other but good Me

                   god. We might wel leaue our goods for pleaſure, & one an other for honour, as in tymes paſte certaine Phyloſophers haue done, whyche lefte one vyce perceiuing other. But no mā
                   can willingly forſake the world, him ſelfe, and al thynge, and haue God for God, and for hys onlye laſte ende, but he alone to whome the bounty of God is dyſcouered, in ſuche wyſe that he may more in hym, thē all the rycheſſes, pleaſures and dygnytyes of the worlde.Roma. i. Whereunto ſuffyſeth not the bounty of God dyſcouered in hys creatures, nor all our naturall lyght, as Paule wryteth to the Romaines. Whome he ſheweth that the naturall lyght, whyche leadeth to the knowledge of God by the creatures, was not ynoughe, becauſe there of they had no lyghte to gloryfy nor yelde the due thankes vnto God.
               Wherefore they are not to be excuſed whyche thynkynge the naturall lyghte to ſuffyſe, and truſting in theyr proper forces, or ſtrengthes, demaunde none other lyght of God, but are to be reputed wycked. For as much as we al haue nede of the deuyne grace and lyght to knowe God ſuffycientlye. Neyther is it ynoughe to beholde hym in hys creatures. But it behoueth wyth the ſpirite and ſupernaturall lyghte to vnderſtande hym in Chriſte, where he dyſcouereth hym ſelfe wyth ſo greate exceſſyue bountye, that hee rauyſheth and draweth vnto hym the heartes, in ſuche wyſe, that
 delyuerynge them of the worlde, he ſaueth them▪ Lette vs therefore fyxe oure eyes in that deuyne ſpectacle, to the ende, that feelyng in hym and by hym the bountye of the father, we may render vnto hym all honoure and glorye by our Sauioure Ieſu Chriſt. Amen.
            
            
               ¶The .iii. Sermon.
               If Philoſophi ſerue to tru Theology or diuiniti, & in what maner
               
                  THere be ſome the whych denying al ſupernatural light thinke that in yt world ther is none other Theology or diuitite but yt natural, whiche they cal Metaphylica. And becauſe that a man can not be a good Metaphyſicus, vnles he be firſt a good philoſopher, therfore thei be conſtrained to ſay that Philoſophy ſerueth to Theology or deuinite. Some other, not being able to deny Theology or diuinity to be ſuper
                     •
                  aturall, ſay that it is grounded vpon the natural, in ſuch wiſe that (after theyr ſaying) as yt knoledge intellectiue requyreth the ſencytyue, becauſe therof it hath original, groweth & hangeth or dependeth, ſo hath Theology or
 diuinitye nede of Phyloſophy, becauſe of it it taketh begining, groweth & is eſtabliſhed
               Philoſophy then after their opinion, is the guide that leadeth vnto Santa Santorum, to behold the celeſtial things. The ladder by the whych it behoueth, to clyme to true Theology or diuinity. And mans reaſon is the rule to the whych (accordynge to theyr iudgmentes) reſort al the knowledge of the deuyne lyght. And in ſo much they do allow them, in as much as they agree, not wyth the holy ſcryptures nor wyth the ſpyrite, but wyth theyr blynde humayn iudgement, whiche they hold for the ſceptre that ſheweth al, euen to God.
               But I ſay, that as our humain reaſon by the ſynne of our fyrſt Parentes, is weake, blynde, frantyke and folyſh. So is likewiſe theyr Philoſophy. And that becauſe that albeit after the ſynne, God left vnto a man a lyght of the natural thynges, neceſſary to the humaine lyfe and conuenient to our miſerable ſtate. Man neuertheles, in whom reſteth a 
                     •
                  ertayn pryde and curioſyty, wolde not contēt him ſelf wyth ſo ſymple a knowledge. As whether a certayn Philoſopher, geuing him ſelf thyrty yeres to ſtudye the knowledge of al the propertyes of the Bee could neuer perfectly attayn hys deſyre.
 The others haue geuen thē ſelues to ſearch the knowledge of al the propertyes, qualytyes, vertues and operacions of euery ſenſible thing and not only of the baſe and corruptyble but alſo of the celeſtial bodies. Yea (and which is more) they haue enterpriſed to ſpeake of the ſonie, of the aungels, of God and of the thynges ſupernatural. In ſuch wyſe that (paſſyng the limites of their ſmal light, and walking blindely) eche one hath fabrycate in hys mynde hys own fantaſye, and to the purpoſe haue ſo ſpoken & wrytten euery one according to his proper freneſy, wherof is growen ſo great variete of opinions, ſo many confuſyons, errours ſec
                     •
                  es and hereſyes, that (as ſainte Ierome iuſtly calleth them) the Philoſophers are ye Patryarkes of the heretykes, and the fyrſt begotten of Egipt. And it is an old prouerb a great Phyloſopher a great heretike.
               The natural reaſon therfore, that is not healed by fayth, is frenetyke and folyſh, as thou mayeſt wel thinke when thou conſyde reſt the preſumptyon, in that it pretendeth to be the guyd, foundacion and ladder of ye deuine knowleges. Wheras it f
                     •
                  rneth not to raiſe the man to the knowledge of God, but much leſſe geueth hym cauſe to confes wyth Socrates that not only he knoweth
 not, but alſo that without the diuine grace he can do nothyng. Albeit that that Phyloſophy is now ſo proud, that wyth the ſuppreſſyng and perſecutyng of Chriſt, the goſpel, the grace & faith, it hath alwayes magnifyed the carnal man, his light & hys powers. And is become ſo frenetyke, that onles it be healed by fayth, it wyll beleue nothing to be true, but that it thynketh good, nether is it poſſyble to perſwade hym in any truth if fyrſt declared vnto hym by hys frenetike reaſons, it be not conformable to hys blind iudgement. Conclude therfore, that Philoſophy lyeth low in the darke vale of vnderſtandyng, and cannot lift the head to ye high and ſupernatural thynges, in reſpect wherof, it is vtterly blynde, and knoweth not, nether by experyence nor reuelatyon, ſo that in it, it is impoſſyble to eſtablyſh the foundacyon of the faith. For as ye feling paſſeth not the region of the ſenſyble thynges. So lykewyſe cannot humayn reaſon nor Phyloſophy paſſe the regiō of the natural thinges▪ The natural man (as wryteth Paule) vnderſtandeth not the thyngs of the ſpirit and becauſe he is not capax, that is perſeneth it not, he mocketh and ſcorneth it. Yea he perſecuteth, baniſheth with ſtandeth, denyeth and repugneth the myracles, reuelacyons,
 prophetes, the grace, fayth, the holye ſcryptures, God, Chriſt and his members. If they hear the Goſpel preached of a faithful man,Ihon. x. they ſay he is mad, furyous or poſſeſſed of the deuel,Mark. v. as was ſaid of Chriſt, If of a learned man, they ſay his great ſtudye hath brought hym out of hys wyts, whych alſo was layed to Paule.Ace. vii. If of an ignoraūt how ſay they can he be learened that neuer ſtudyed letters. And if of a pore wretch (as touchynge the worlde) they ſaye to hym as was ſayed to the borne blynde man.Ihon. ix. Thou waſt borne in ſynne, and wylte thou teache me? And ſo in effect can in no wyſe abide to heare the thynges of God. Go read the holy ſcriptures, and thou ſhalt fynde that the carnal wyſdome and humayne reaſō hathe alwayes rebelled agaynſt God. She is the ſame that fygured by the ſerpent, perſwaded our fyrſt parentes to taſt of the prohibited apple, and that beleued not the word of God, and that afterwardes taughte them ſelues. That made Cain to ſlea hys brother Abel, and that perſwaded the worlde in the tyme of Noe, that the general diluge or flud ſhuld not come. She cauſed the buyldynge of the towre of Babel. She prouoked Pharao to reſyſt God. She induced the people of God to murmure agaynſt hym, and to
 worſhip the goldē calfe, & moued the Gentiles to ydolatry. It is that harlot yt made Salomon, looſe hys wittes, and ſtirred his father to kyl Vri
                     •
                  . And fynallye, ſhe is the ſame that perſecuted the Patriarckes, prophetes, Apoſtles, Martirs, & ſaintes of the old and new teſtamente. Beholde whether ſhe be a wycked fole or not that put Chriſt on the croſſe, and wher as Chriſt crucifyed is the ryght wyſdome of God ſhe accounteth it for a mere madnes. Sureli ther is no thyng that hath ſo much fauoured the kingdome of Antechriſt as ſhe which hath introduced all the ſuperſticions, hipocriſies. Idolatryes and euyls that haue bene cōmitted vnder color of holines. The faith hath not hadde a greater ennemy then ſhe. The church of Chriſt was a paradyſe whyles ye ſymple fayth reygned. But takyng in hand the Scepter of humain reaſon, it is become a confuſed Babilō. And wheras the cleare, ſure, and infallyble fayth, by geuyng light of the truth, magnyfying Chriſt, hys grace and the Goſpell, doth adnichilate or bryng to nought the fleſhlye man, and maketh the parſon, ſymple, pure, immaculate, vertuous and holye. The darke, blynde deceitful frenetyke foolyſh and heretical carnal reaſon, wyſdome and Phyloſophy, condem

 and oppreſſeth the truth. And to proue and extolle the erroures, perſecuteth, crucyfyeth and buryeth Chriſt, the grace & the goſpel, and magnifieth the carnal man euē to the heauen. Al the harlots together haue not ſo much corrupted the world, as this only carnal reaſon, prudence and falſe Philoſophye. No nor the ſymple ignoraunce hath not ſo much confuſed the world as y• humayne ſcyence, wyſdome and Philoſophy, which maketh men bold, vnſhamefaſt hoote, lyers, proud, contencious, frenetike folyſh and wycked.Colloſ. iii. Wherfore Paul exhorted the Coloſſions to beware of her deceyt becauſe (as God ſayth by the Prophet Eſay) ſhe begyleth the parſons.Eſay. xlvii. For the wiſe of the world be ye moſt deceiued, moſt foles moſt wicked and moſt contrary to Chriſt. And it requireth a ſpeciall miracle to conuert one of thē. Read the chriſtian hiſtories & thou ſhalt fynde that thoſe be they which euermore haue bene the firſt to perſecute ye goſpel. And they are very wycked and folyſh that wyl ground Chriſt vpō Ariſtotel euen lyke vnto theym that wyll b

                  ylde a Iowre vpon a wheaten ſtraw. Chriſt and not the Phyloſophy is the only true foundation of his church and of the true ſupernatural diuinity of the which he is the onli
 workmaſter and not Ariſtotell, I praye the what hath Ariſtotle to do with Chriſt. Many haue enforſed them ſelues to agre Ariſtotle wyth Plato, but they could neuer bring it to paſſe, becauſe Ariſtotel, beginning at y• loweſt of the ſenſible thynges, ryſeth in the ende to as hygh as maye be. And Plato beginneth wheras Ariſtotle endeth. Conſyder now how it is poſſyble to agree hym wyth Chriſt, though many wyl make hym a piller of the goſpel & a ladder to clyme to heauen. Let vs therfore repute the ſciences of the world as vain being lyke vnto the harlots, that with theyr flattering wordes and deceites corrupt the mindes. And let vs cō
                  ſyder that if the prieſtes of the old Teſtamēt wer prohibited to take a commune woman for a wyfe, how much more the Chriſtian that is al wholy conſecrate and dedycate to God ought to flee and eſchewe the vayne ſcyences and only ſeruing him ſelf of them as of moſt viſe handmaidens, to knit hymſelf in ſpyryte and wyth hart & mynde to apply hym ſelf to that pure and immaculate virgin of the holy Theology or deuinity? To the intēt that euerlaſtingly we may render to God al laud honour and glorye, by oure Sauioure Ieſu Chriſt.

                   For therto it behoueth hym to haue the ſpirite and ſupernatural lyght that God with hys fauour do open and penetrate yt minde by hys deuyne grace. So that therefore we muſt not accōpt the holy ſcriptures for our laſt end, or for our ſupreame Quene or Empereſſe, but for meanes that ſerue to y• faith to the ſpirite and to the true knowledge of God, much more then the creatures. And we ought to ſerue our ſelues of them in dyuers wayes, for that they fyrſt incyte and teach vs to repayre to God, ſayinge in him is the cheif boūty, go to him, for he is faithful, and hath promyſed to make you taſt al vertue and goodnes in him.

                  , and ſeke none other light but that. Yea I ſay that for one houres ſtudye, they ought to prai a thouſand, & to demaūd of God the true vnderſtandyng of theym▪ And lyke as the Pa

 to ſtudy in the boke of the minde in whiche (they ſay) is imprynted al the verity. So muſt we couſyder that the holy ſcryptures do cal vs to Chriſt, in whome (as Paul ſayeth) be hyd al the treaſures of wyſdom and knowledge. This is no leſſe then true, that lyke as if thou haddeſt a frend whom thou haſt not tryed (though alwayes thou haſte trauayled to proue hym) thou woldeſt not inwardly know hym for a frynde (though he wer euer in thyue eye) becauſe the profe hath not roted hym in thy minde. So albeit the holy ſcriptures do cal and exhort the to ſeke God in ſpyryte, it is yet impoſſyble yt thou ſhuldeſt fynde god in truth in ye ſcryptures, if fyrſt by ſpyryt, thou haue hym not at the harte.
               They ſerue alſo an other maner, that many tymes happeneth. As wher god maketh the in ſpyryte wyth lyuely faythe to feele a

                   Prophecyes veryfyed the ſhadowes, fygures and ſcryptures of the olde Teſtamēt he that readeth it and ſeeth all fulfylled in Chriſt, is forced to ſatyſfy hym ſelfe of the truthe, and to eſtablyſh hym ſelf in fayth. For Chriſt ſēt the Iewes (that wold not beleue hym) to the holy ſcryptures, as to thē that wytneſſed of hym. Afterwardes, albeit that in the church of God, to be ſatyſfied grounded and eſtablyſhed in the deuyne, celeſtyal and ſupernaturall veryty, it behoueth in effect to come to the inward witnes of the holy ghoſt, without whome we can not know whych ſcryptures be of God, be holy and whych not. Neuertheles, after y• our holy ſcriptures be of god, we ought to ſerue ourſelues of them, as of a certayn infallyble & ſupreame outward rule to teach reprehend, correct and exhorte the others & to conuynce thē that ſpeake agaynſt it.

               The .v. Sermon.
               Of thin conueniences that are happened and daylye happen by the abuſe of the holy ſcriptures.
               THe holy ſcryptures of them ſelues be the good gyftes of God and of the holy Ghoſt. Neuertheles they may be vſed of vs wel or euyl, as by experyence it is manyfeſt. For wheras gods elect ſerue thē ſelues of it to Gods honour, the reprobate contrarywyſe ſerue them ſelues of it to his dyſhonour, through theyr own faute & not of the ſcryptures, in ſo much that in reſpect of theyr wicked maligniti it hath perehaūce done hurt in ſom waies to ye world, though At length, God of hys infynyte bounty reduceth al thynges to hys honoure and glory. For fyrſt the ſcryptures annoyed them who haue bene diligent to gather together many bokes, and neglygent to ſtudy them. Thynkynge them ſelfes fully learned whē they haue had theyr lybrary ful of bokes. Other ſome ſtudying, haue not attained to imprynte the truthe that they found in their myndes, and therefore haue wrytten it in papers, ſo that rea
                     ••
                  yng mooſt ignoraunt, al theyr learnynge conſyſteth in theyr wrytyngs, and loſyng them, they alſo loſe their
 ſcyence. Whych was one of the argumēts that cauſed Plato to condempne letters, ſayinge that before ſcrypture was founde, the menne were much better learened then ſince, becauſe they were forced to wryte in theyr myndes that that afterwardes they haue wrytten in paper. I paſſe ouer that many haue conſumed theyr tyme in the diſhonoure of God, in readynge and wrytynge of thynges curyous and peruycious to the health And that many tranſported of Curioſity, haue wylled to ſe ſo many bokes that in the end they remained cōfuſed with out frute. As doth the fyelde whereon they caſt ouermuch ſeede. And of ſome that by thoſe meanes haue loſt their wits. But that whych importeth much more is that they thynke the true knowledge of Theolegy or deuynyty conſyſteth in letters, whych is vtterly falſe, becauſe they geue not true and lyuely lyght of the ſupernatural thynges, y• cannot otherwyſe be knowen of vs but by ſpyryte, reuelatyon, fayth, ſpyrytuall taſte, lyuely vnderſtandyng and ſure experiēce. For lyke as the Phyloſopher wythout experyence can haue no knowledge although he beare in mynde al that is wrytten, & not hauynge practyſed, he muſt reaſt only in opynyon grounded vpon Aryſtotle, Plato
 and the other Philoſophers, which moueth hym to beleue theyr wrytyng to be true, being neuertheles in very dede more ignoraūt then is the poore paiſaunt or huſbandman, that by labouryng of the earth, wythout ſekynge letters, fyndeth the operacion of many natural thynges, that proueth hys ſcyence to be ſomewhat & theirs none, though well they ſtudy foreuer and wante experyence. So lykewyſe one ſymple ydeot wythout learnynge, if he haue fayth, lyuely taſte and ſpyrytuall vnderſtandyng of God, is a greater deuyne then all the learened men of the worlde that be wythout ſpirite. Yea he is a deuyne and they none. For that of ye heauenly ſupernatural thynges he knoweth ſo much as he taſteth, and experimēteth by fayth, and the learned man hath onlye a barrayne, ydle, colde and deade opynyon whyche ſtandeth wythout faythe in deſperacyon and accompanyed of euery vyce. Now therfore it appeareth that of thys erroure, by thynkynge that true Theology or deuynyty conſyſteth in learnyng, there are innumerable inconueniences growen, and chefely that many, wantynge letters, & not hauynge tyme to ſtudy, thynkyng that by other wayes it is impoſſyble to become dyuynes, haue not dyſpoſed them ſelues to demaund
 of God with meke hart and feruēt deſyre the lyght of the deuyne thyngs. And moreouer they haue fled and wythdrawen them ſelues from the intellygence or vnderſtandynge of the holy ſcryptures, as from aterryble ruyne, becauſe theyr wyſe learened and holy men haue perſwaded them y• no man may vnderſtand it but they only y• are learned.

               Ther be many that ſtudying the holy ſcriptures wythout ſpyryt, lyuely fayth aud ſupernatural lyght, haue not only not attayued the true knowledge of the boūty of god and theyr owne proper myſeryes, but the more they haue ſtudied, the more, by the dri and deade letter, they are become blynde of God and of them ſelues.

               ¶The .vi. Sermon.
               If to be good deuynes it behoue vs to haue the humain ſciences or not.
               THere be many that thinke it is not poſſyble to attayne the perfection of Theology, if fyrſt a man learne not Gramer, Dialectica, Philoſophy & Metaphiſica, Yea Scotus Thomas Bonauenture & ſuch other. I confeſſe my ſelfe to haue bene in that errour, and therfore am now moued to compaſſyon of them that reaſte blynded wythal. If it wer as they ſay, we ſhulde be mooſt boūden vnto the inuentours of thoſe ſcyences, ſyns that by thē we may be good deuynes, and wythout them not. And then I praye you if they happened to peryſhe or thoſe authours to be loſte ſhoulde it not follow that alſo the world ſhuld lacke deuinity? And lykewyſe if the learned menne i
                     •
                   thoſe ſcyences be onelye the good deuynes, and conſequentlye ſainctes (the contrarye wherof is clearly ſeene) then might wel the ſimple and vnlearned people deſpayre of al ghoſtly health and the true and neceſſari diuinity hange vpon humayne ſcyences. So by that reaſō it ſhuld behoue vs to ſay that the Apoſtles and in maner al the ſaynctes.
 Yea and the bleſſed virgin Mary were not good deuynes, not withſtandyng that they haue taughte others. No nor Chriſte neuer learned thoſe humayne ſciences, & yet was he the moſt excellent deuyne.Ihon. iii. Therfore we muſt knowe that one humayne ſcyence leadeth v

And becauſe faith is a gift of God,Ephe. ii. and the true deuinity a ſupernatural light, not attaynable or can not be attayned of vs, but geuen of God to his elect. Therfore euery ſymple ydeote and ignoraūt of the humain ſcyences, may by the grace of God,Act. viii. ſodenly become a perfect deuine, and Chriſtian, as in the actes of the Apoſtles
 it is red of the

                  unucho. It is poſſyble then, that a ſymple olde woman maye haue more of the true Theology or deuinity, then al the learned mē of the world. For the humayne ſciences do fyl our mindes of ſmoke and pryde, and occupy them in ſuch wiſe (that diſtract with Marta) they be not attentyue wyth Mary to receiue the knowledge of God It is ſene by experyence that rather and more lightly the ſymple haue accepted the goſpel then the learned men of ye world. Yea where the ſymple, the ydeotes, the lytle chyldren & the Samarytanes magnified Chriſt, the learned ſcrybes and Phariſeis perſecuted hym to the deathe of the croſſe. And when the world conuerteth, ſeldom the learned men come to the faith, but haue bene euer the laſt. Ther could none enter into Sancta Sanctorum by the old law but the high biſhop. But Chriſt dying on ye croſſe,Colloſ. ii. hath ouerthrowen the vayle of the tē

Thy wordes be open, they lyghten and geue vnderſtandyng to the litle ones. That hygh and deuyne wiſdom is become
 ſo low and open in Chriſt, that euery ſimple may vnderſtand. For that Chriſt is not come as an humayne man to teache vs letters, but is deuinely and ſpiritually deſcended to kindle the ſpirit, light chariti & grace in the hartes of his electe, and ſo hathe he made them to vnderſtand, euen to the children which magnifi him,Math. xxi. ſaying: Bleſſed is he that is come in the name of the Lorde. And Chriſte reproued hys Apoſtles when they letted the chyldren of comming to him though now their be many that wil not allow the holy ſcriptures to be had in the vulgare tounge,Luke. xviii nor red and declared to ye ſimple, as if they could not vnderſtand thē, no

               The .vii. Sermon.
               Howe a Chriſtian oughte to make his laſt wil and teſtament.
               
                  IT is commonly the cuſtome of men in their teſtamētes, and laſt wyls to ſai: I leaue, I bequeath, I geue, wythoute once ſayinge I take or cari with me wherein certes they be farre deceiued becauſe they take that, whych they ought to leaue be hynde thē, and go wythoute caryinge that whyche is very behofeful and neceſſary. Wherfore to the entent they ſhuld no more erre on yt behalfe. I wold we ſhuld conſyder and weyghe how a true Chriſtian ſhuld make hys wyll.
               Men that be either fooles, mad, phrantyke, neyther 
                     〈◊〉
                  , nor yet know how to make a wyll, by reaſon they haue not wytte to deſcerne good from euyll, what is theires, or what is not, what to take, nor what to reſtore or be queath, nor yet to whome nor in what manner. And if happely they go about
 to make theyr teſtamēt, it ſhuld be but vain and of no force God alloweth it not as a thing made of a parſon witles. Wherefore he that is willing to make a teſtament effectual (as expedient is to him that will be ſaued) behoueth to haue very good ſpiritual iudgment, a liueli faith in Chriſt, and an vnderſtanding and light aboue a natural mā, he muſt alſo be the ſonne, and lawful heyre of God.
               And then he may ſay: I ſound of mynde, and ready of ſpirit and remembraunce, albeit as touching my fleſh ſyck make my teſtament, and

                  equeath fyrſt of al my being and ſubſtaunce to god: he gaue it to me and alſo preſerued it, and of hym I recogniſe to haue it, and for it I render him thanckes. I leaue to him like wiſe the giftes, graces, benefites temporal, bodely and goſtly, that I haue had, or ſhall heare after receyue: for they

                  e his, and from hym by grace I acknowledge to haue receyued all, as Paule ſayeth, what haſt thou, that thou haſt not receiued at gods handes. Yea for aſmuch as al the ſlaunders, miſreportes, perſecuciōs, ſickenes, and miſfortunes, which I haue already or ſhal from hence forth ſuffer, and euen death ſelf, I confeſſe (by the vnderſtanding that the Lord hath geuen me) that thei
 haue beue and ſhalbe his giftes and graces geuen and graunted of a great loue for my wealth and profit: wherfore as his deuyne rewardes I graunt to haue had thē of god, for them I thancke him, and as hys owne I leaue and reſtore them to him.
               And for ſo much as I cānot but acknowledge that I haue gone alwaies backward from him ſo often as I wolde rule my ſelfe by my blynde iudgement, folyſhe wiſdome and deueliſhe ſpirite, nether did ſo much as go one ſteppe forthe toward God, but whē I was moued, dryuen, and thruſt forwarde of his holy ſpirit. Wherefore I commit to the higheſt God my moſt deare father, and to his gouernance, al the world and ſpecially my ſelf, in him (as I may) I wil help my ſelfe with myne owne wytte, and fredome, namely by makynge it obedyent to hym▪

 myne own, and al other thinges he his.
               Thus be my ſinnes if I ſhuld go before gods preſence. I were but dampned, if I were mynded to make ſatiſfaction I could not, no nor yet anye ſayncte that euer was, ther is none whoſe loue is ſo greate to take my ſinnes vppon him and ſatiſfy for them, and appeaſe gods anger ſaue Chriſt alone, wherfore to him I bequeath my ſynnes. I leaue to hym my pride, vnkindenes, vnbeleue, miſtruſt, arrogancy, enuy, wrath, ambitiō, and al my vnnumerable wickednes, I geue to him my euil thoughtes, affectiōs, and deſires: to be ſhort I make one fagot & boundel of al my offences preſent, paſt and to come, and geue them to Chriſt hauynge ſure fayth, and ſtedfaſt hope, that he wil accept them for his own, and hath euen already taken them, and for them hath ſatiſfyed on the croſſe, hys father layed them on hys necke,Eſaye, lii

                        •
                     . as my father hath made me hys heyre ſo nowe I ordein you. I wil that as you be my brethren ſo you ſhalbe my folowers. And in another place he ſayeth: I haue loued you, as mi father hath loued me ſithen I am nowe through Chriſte ſo ryche of treaſures, vertuouſe, and graces▪ I ſhal be hable not onely to ſatiſfy for my dettes, but alſo to purchaſe infinite paradiſe, when
 ſoeuer they ſhalbe ſoulde.
               Who ſhalbe nowe either to accuſe or cō
                  demne me, after that Chriſt hathe thus clothed me with his innocenſy, rightwiſenes, holynes, loue, with all his vertuſe, graces, treaſures, merites, and with his own ſelfe. I may with no leſſe boldenes and ſuretye, then Chriſt, appeare before God, I am his ſonne, as he is, and heyre of heauen, ſemblably I am innocent as Chriſt is now that he hathe ſatiſfied for me, and payed my raunſome, and rewarded me wyth his innocency, Chriſte ſaied: I hallow my ſelf that they alſo maye be holye, euen he is oure holynes and we be his members. Wherfore it is as poſſible for God not to loue me, as it is poſſible that he ſhuld not loue Chriſt, by reaſon wherof Paule ſayeth:Roma. viii. who ſhall deuide me from the loue of God that is in Chriſte Ieſu. It muſt nedes be that he be ſaued which wyth lyuynge faythe embraceth Chriſte for hys owne. And conſideringe that the treaſures, and merites of Chriſte are infinite, and able to enryche a thouſande worldes, I entende not to carye with me anye other merites, nor ſpirituall ryches ſaue thoſe that Chriſte hathe prouyded for me, for they be not onlye ſufficient for me, but alſo ouer aboundaunce and vnmeſurable.
               Then ſhoulde I do no ſmall iniurye to
 Chriſt, if I ſhuld ſearch to ſtore my ſelfe by any other meane or ſhift, although I might do it neuer ſo eaſely, nay rather wyth Paul wyl I recken al other thynges as myre and dyrt ſo that I haue Chriſte,Philip, iii. wyth whome alone I wil appeare before God, and of and by hym wyl I glorye and make boaſte,Galath. vi. yea God for byd, that I ſhuld make my auaūte of any thing, ſaue of the croſſe of our Lorde Ieſu Chriſt of whome only hangeth al our health. And albeit al the ſaintes be ryche by meane of Chriſt, neuertheles, if they had merytes of theyr owne moſte plenteouſe, and wolde geue them to me, yet wolde I none, my Chriſt is inoughe for me, with him had I rather ſuffer, then take pleaſure and ioye without him. It would be a thing pleaſaūt to me, if euerye man ſhulde make prayer to God for me, not becauſe I myght purchaſe or haue anye other treaſures then thoſe that I haue of Chriſt, but that I might by liuely faith euery day acknowledge, poſſeſſe and embrace thoſe y• I haue receyued of Chriſte and counte them for myne and ſo enforme my ſelfe, I my ſelfe were it not by Chriſte, ſhoulde not knowe what to aſke, for in him is al and without him al other things be but mere vanitie, onely this peticion I make to him, that he vouchſafe euery dai to geue me light and vnderſtandinge, that I may haue
 wyt to accounte and take hys treaſures for mine owne. Wherfore if any man wil pray for me let hym not tarye tyll I be deade, for then I canne no more encreaſe in lighte and grace. Let him pray now, that I may grow in faith and more and more inſtruct my ſelf of Chriſtes riches. I am wel aſſured that in purgatorye I ſhall not come, bothe becauſe there is founde no other purgatorye but Chriſte in whome at the full be purged and puniſhed al the ſynnes of the elected, and al ſo becauſe in caſe there were one, yet Chriſt not by my merites, but by hys mere goodnes dothe ſatiſfie for al my ſynnes, treſpaſſes, and paynes, and for as muche as hope neuer made any man aſhamed, nor confounded anye perſone,Rom. iii. that hadde it in hys harte (as Paul wrote) therfore am I ſure and ſecker that he wyll ſaue me without other purgacion.

 godly, and knowe that they ſhal neuer lack that be hys, and put theyr truſt in hym. To whom be alwayes, honoure and glory through Ieſu Chriſt our Lord Amen.
            
            
               ¶The .viii. Sermon.
               Howe we ſhoulde anſwer the deuel when he tempteth vs & name lye in the ende of oure lyfe.
               THe Deuel (as Peter wryteth) ſeketh alwaye to deuoure vs but chefelye he is buſye at the houre of death,i. Peter. v. by reaſon then it ſtandeth hym in hand ſo to do for his owne behooue, and our greater endomage and harme. Then vſeth he al myght, power ſleyghte, deceyte, and malice: wherefore I thynke good that we ſhulde ſearch howe to make hym aunſweare and by the aſſiſtence and ayde of gods grace to vnderſtand him aud get the vpper hande of hym.
               He is conſtrayned ſpeciallye when wee aproch nere to oure death, to throw vs into a biſſe and pit of deſperacion, or els to ſet vs in pride and preſumpciō: if he ſhal perceyue that thou either put truſt in thy ſelf, or confidence in thyne owne worckes, he will not 
                     •
                  oo in hande to make the deſpayre and miſtruſt
 gods mercy, but rather ſtabliſhe the in that erronyouſe opinion of pryde of thy dedes, on the other ſyde if he fele that thou haſt all thy hope in God: then wyl he ſhew the on the one partie the multitude and wickednes of thy ſynnes, and on the other partie goddes wrathe and ſeuere iuſtice, he wyl tell the how thou art in a maze and perplexitie not able to be ſhaken of, or wonden out of, and by makyng the to fele thyne offences, otherwiſe then euer thou dyddeſt in thy healthe wyll go aboute to take oute of thy harte the paſſion of Chriſt, and all the great goodnes, mercy, and loue of God, & finally to proue the damued, he wyl bryng for hys purpoſe, euen the holy ſcriptures.
               But I wyll that al hys temtacions ſerue the to the honour of God and ſaluacio
                     •
                   of thy ſoule as they do ſerue the turne of the elected, to whom all thynges woorke to gether for theyr wealth,Roma. viii. fyrſte of all I warne the, that thou maintein not thy ſelf for good but admit and graunte all the euill that he ſhall reherſe of the and thynke, that he hath not ſaied ſo muche,i. Ihon. ii. but that it is much more and thanke God that now at laſte he hathe bene ſo fauorable, to make the cōſider thy ſinnes, wherin he vſeth the deuel for an inſtrument, to the entent that by the knowing of them, thou ſhuldeſt take occaſion to humble
 thy ſelfe, and to cal Chriſt to thy remembraunce, whyche to ſcoure and clenſe them hath not onlye reputed them for hys owne, but alſo dyed for them vpō the croſſe, graūt thou hardely that thou art a greate rybalde and noughtye withoute excuſynge thy ſelfe in any wiſe, and that thy ſinnes are innumerable. Confeſſe that thou could neuer ſatiſfye for one alone, and that thou were the moſt damned ſinner of the world if Chriſte had not deliuered the, and ſtyl prompte thy ſelfe with thoſe matters, whyche maye further the to come into deſperacion of thy ſelf
               But if the deuel wait to bryng the to deſpayre of Chriſt, thou may in no wyſe cōſent therto, but ſtedfaſtly put thy truſt in hym. And my mynd is that thou ſay to him thus: If it were good for me to miſtruſt Chriſt, yu neuer wouldeſt haue perſwaded me therto but rather haue drawen me from it, wherefore in that thou woldeſt putte me in mynde to miſtruſt Chriſt, thou makeſt me ſtronger in my hope and truſt.
               Thou ſhalt ſay to him, that when he cauſed iniuſtly Chriſt to dye, whych was an innocent, he loſt al his interpriſe and inriſdiction, that euer he had or poſſible might haue ouer man. Aud if he procede forth to induce the to deſpayre, by ſettynge before the thy greate ſynnes. I wyll the to ſay to hym. Go
 to Chriſt,
                     
                        •
                     , Ihon, ii. which (as Ihon wryteth) is myne attournei and aduocate, he can make the an aunſwere for me, reaſon there with hym, if thou haue any claime or title in me, as thou ſayeſt, doeſt thou not know that he hath taken my ſynnes for hys owne, and hathe for them made ſatiſfactyon moſt plentuouſly, therfore haſt thou no ryght in me at al.
               If he chaunce to ſay his death is not inough to ſane the, anſwere him: if Adam by taſting one apple with one only ſinne was hable to damne me: how is it that ſo manye holy workes of Chriſt, which taſted for my ſake of great loue the moſt bytter death, be not ſufficient to ſaue me. If the diſobedience of Adam had power to condemn me,Roma. vi. much more the obedyence of Chriſte is ſtronge inough to ſaue me, yea the gift of Chriſt is aboue and excedeth the ſynne of Adā, Chriſt hath more auayled and holpen vs, then Adam annoied and harmed vs, by reaſon the light of Chriſt is of more force & effect then the darkenes of our fyrſt parent, the goodnes of Chriſtes ſurmounteth and paſſeth y• malice of man, and his vertue preuaileth aboue oure frailty: one teare of Chriſte hathe bene more pleaſaunt to God, thē al the ſins of the world be diſpleaſaunt, Chriſt hath be able to do more to appeace hym, then we to prouoke hym to anger, Chriſtes liuing was
 more formal and ordinary, then oures was out of order and frame. Chriſt hath doone more to the honour of God, then we haue done to his diſhonoure. Wherfore I maye wel ſay, Chriſt that is my wiſdom, right wiſnes, holynes, and redempcion is ſufficient inough to ſaue me.i. Corin, i.
               
               And if haply he ſhuld ſay, it is not ſufficient for thy ſaluacion to beleue in Chriſte, the be houeth to keepe his commaundementes, thou muſt loue God wythal thy hart, & thy neyghbour as thy ſelf, and deſire nor couet any thing worldly, which thinges becauſe thou doeſt not, ergo, thou art dampned, if fayth only wer inough I alſo and al the deuels ſhuld be ſaued, becauſe (as it is writtē) euen the deuels beleue and feare.Iacob. ii. They beleue that God made and created heauē and earth, and that Chriſt came, dyed, roſe, aſcē
                  ded into heauen, that he ſent the holy ghoſt, and that he ſhal come to iudge the quicke & dead, and yet are not we therfore ſaued, and that becauſe we obſerue not his deuine preceptes. Wherfore thou alſo art but loſt, he wyl thus labour to bring the vnder the law to thinke that thou muſt be iuſtified not by Chriſt, but by perfourminge and fulfillinge of the lawe, to the end yt thou ſhuld deſpair.
               But I wyl that thou make anſwere and ſay: if thou diddeſt beleue as by gods grace
 I beleue: that is, that God for thy wealthe hath created the worlde, and ſemblably preſerueth it, in ſuch ſort that thou couldeſt fele in the creatures the loue of God, and lykewyſe wold beleue firmely, that Chriſt came and dyed for thy ſinnes, for to ſaue the, and for thy ſake and profit, and in lyke manner of the other articles, thou alſo ſhould be ſaued, and then, when thou haddeſt a liuely feling of the goodnes and loue of God thou woldeſt loue hym, and thy neyghbour likewyſe, and beynge rauyſhed into God wouldeſt begynne to ſet litle ſtore by the world as al good Chriſten men and women do. If it fortune that he ſay:Deu. xxvii he is curſed that kepeth not and obſerueth the lawe, wherfore thou arte one of myne,Galath. iii. Roma. vii. ſaye to hym agayne, for that cauſe Chriſt dyed on the croſſe, for to delyuer me from all curſes, and in ſo much as I am alreadye of Chriſt, I am deade to the lawe.
               Agayne if he replye ſaying: wher be thy workes, whereby thou truſteſt to be ſaued? anſwer, I truſt not to be ſaued bi mi works for they be ſuch that if I ſhuld haue regard or reſpect to them. I feare me to be damned yea I were ſurely acertained of my damnacion. I hope only to be ſaued by Chriſt, and hys workes,Rom. viii. whyche be myne owne, and ſo much rather myne, then they I dyd myſelf
 as that the ſpirite of Chriſte geuen to me is more entyer to me then myne own life or any other thyng.
               Further if he ſhulde endeuour to proue the to be none of the elect, by reaſon of the innumerable, and outragiouſe ſynnes that thou haſt committed, for proſperites, or aduerſities thou haſt had, for the great euylles wherin thou art founde at thy deathe, or for the temptacyons thou haſte ſuſteyned, ſayinge, that God preſerueth his elected from the lyke euyls.Rom. viii. Make hym anſwer and ſay: rather dothe God practyſe them in diuerſe ſuch manners, albeit of euerything they be certified to the honoure of God, thou ſhalt moreouer ſay to hym thus. I geue more credite and truſte to Chriſte, whiche when he was deade for me on the croſſe, tould me I was ſaued, then to the, that arte alwayes a lyer and father of erroures. I wyll thou tel hym, how thou geueſt more fayth to Chriſt alone, then to al the reaſons and authorities of the world: thou may by ſyde thys ſaye to him, the ſpirit of God beareth witnes to mi ſpirit, that I am the ſonne of god and to him muſte I rather truſte then to the. When he ſhall ſaye, if thou were the ſonne of God he would not leaue the in ſuch puniſhmentes, as thou art in, but would geue the ſonne releaſe and eaſement, anſwere hym: In caſe it
 were as thou ſayeſt Chriſt ſhulde not haue bene the ſonne of God, ſithen on the croſſe he had no comfort, nor ſenſual taſt or feling ſo that he ſayd: my God, my god why haſt thou forſaken me:Mark. xv. it ſufficeth to me that he ſheweth me ſo much fauoure, for I am contented with all that pleaſeth hym, as Chriſt alſo was, yea in his ſufferinge, he felt excedingly the infinite loue of the father.
               Beſide theſe if he ſay: thou art the ſonne of Adam,Epheſi. ii. ergo thou art accurſed, Anſwere thou thus: I am bleſſed agayne by brynge borne of God,Ihon. i. and by meane of that bleſſed ſede Chriſt as God long agone promiſed Adam when he ſayed: In thy ſede al nacyons ſhalbe bleſſed,Gene. xii. thou ſhalt tel hym: how thou art deſpoiled and bereft of the old Adam, & clothed with Ieſu Chriſt as Paul teacheth and aduertiſeth the,Roma. xiii.
               
               What time as he ſhal declare to the that Chriſt is wroth, angry and ſharp: make him anſwere how Chriſt is not ſuch one, for he is the health and hope of ſinners, and whyleſt we be in this life preſent he is vttered to vs, pitifull, ſweete, and oure Ieſus, that is, our ſauiour
                     •
                  , and al be it he ſeme to ſpeake ſharpe, and cruel wordes to the woman of Canany:yet in heart he gaue her confidēce and boldnes,Math. xv. and ſhewed him ſelf to her ful of ſwetenes and loue. In dede at the day of
 iudgement to the damned ſhall he be ſhewed angry, & wrathful but in the meane tyme till that day while we be here in this preſent life, he is ſhewed pitiouſe to al, and pryncipally to the greate ſynners.
               And if it ſo were that he wolde ſaye thou art not truly confeſſed, nor haſt rehearſed al thy ſynnes, and the circumſtaunces of the ſame, ne haſt examyned ſufficiently thy conſcience, nor yet haſte no
                     •

                  hat pure perfecte greate and vnſayned ſorowe for thy ſynnes that thou of dutye ſhuldeſt haue, thou haſte not ſatyſfyed for thoſe ſo great an vnnumerable dettes, that thou haſte towarde God, make hym thys aunſwere aud ſay: thou art a ſeruaunt and not a iudge: or to ſaye more truly, thou art al ready iudged and condemned, ſeing thou beleueſt not in Chriſt,Ihon. iii. & woldeſt thou iudge me? trouble thy ſelfe no longer in prouynge that I haue failed in al, for ſure I am, and fully I beleue to be ſaued, not by workes by reaſon they be vnperfect nor yet by the worthynes of my fayth, for in that alſo I am not perfect, becauſe I beleue not with ſo great a faith as I oughte, but I beleue I ſhalbe ſaued by Chriſte, and not by my workes.
               He wyl ſay: thou art not worthy to be ſaued, ſay thou to him for a ful anſwer: the vnworthy be ſaued ſo often as they acknoweledge
 theyr owne vnworthines, go hartelye for healpe to Chriſte, by whoſe meane they be come worthye.
               Where as he ſhal laye to thy charge that thou arte one of the worſte of the world, ſay to hym on thys wyſe: oure infyrmytyes be but ſmall in compariſion of the infinite merites of Chriſte, and of the incomprehenſyble mercye of God: and the more great that my ſinnes be and without number, ſo much greater ſhalbe hys glorye in deliuering me, and I with ſo muche the greater truſt pray as that if he wyll heare me, it ſhall be more to hys honoure and glorye. And when I cō
                  ſyder and call to remembraunce, that my ſweete and louinge brother Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, whyche for my ſake dyed on the croſſe, and wolde agayne innumerable tymes for me, if neede were, and that I am hys owne for ſo manye cauſes, and that he may determyne of me after his own mind. For ſo muche as hys father hathe geuen hym full power in heauen and earth: when I conſyder thys, I ſay, I canne in no wyſe doute of my ſaluacion.
               If he efte ſoones reaſon thus: thou haſte done no penannce for thy ſynnes, anſweare on thys manner: that can I neuer doo, if I ſhoulde alwaye ſtande in the fyre, Chriſte hathe done that for me on the croſſe moreouer
 Chriſte is myne, the father hathe geuen hym to me wyth al his merites, al the good worckes, that euer he dyd are myne, wherefore I maye with his deuine riches, aud treſures ſatiſfy for al.
               After thys manner I wolde thou ſhulde aunſwere him, when ſo euer he ſetteth afore the thy ſinnes, and infinite dettes, that thou oughteſt to God for the benefites, thou haſt receyued wyth dyuerſe and ſundrye vyces whyle he tempte the, but ſpecyallye wyth deſperacion, wherwith he tempteth euen ye ſayntes he wyll put the in mynde and myſtruſte that Chriſte hathe forſaken the: but make anſwere that he neuer forſoke perſon that truſted in hym, but becauſe he wold for ſake none of vs, he was myneded to be forſaken him ſelfe on the croſſe, and if he ſhuld at anye tyme forſake and refuſe vs (the whiche is a thinge impoſſible) it ſhoulde be for more glorye of God, and we oughte not on lye to be contented, but alſo to take it for a ſynguler priuiledge and prerogatyue. It be houeth vs to ſtande ſtronge in the faythe, and thynke that afore God the paſſyon of Chriſt can do more to cauſe him to loue vs, then oure ſynnes canne procure hys hate to ward vs, we had nede to bewel armed with ſpirite, faythe, and grace, for learning ſufficeth

Then it is expedient for the to ſay thus, Thou wouldeſt that I ſhuld truſt in my workes, and I haue no feare of being dampned, wer it not for my workes, I geue thankes to my Lord Chriſt Ieſus, whych hath geuen me the grace to counte my workes for a thing of nought, & for ſuch, that euery one of them I deſerue to be punyſhed, thou magnifieſt my workes, to draw me backe from the confydence of Chriſt, but by gods grace, thou ſhalt not be able to do it, I fynde that I am vpon a litle bourd in the ſea toſſed with myghty wynds and haue embraced and be clepped a ſtrōg pyller or rocke, and thou counceleſt me to leaue it, and to ſticke to the rotten thynges whych I ſhuld do, the windes would carye bothe me and them into the ſea▪ Rather I wyl periſh with Chriſt which is a thyng

Wherfore it is neceſſary that we deſpoile our ſelfes of al truſt in our own workes, and by fayth and hope, clothe vs and arme vs with Chriſt and in hym put our hope, and although we haue not that great fayth, yet in no wyſe ought we to deſpayre, becauſe if at the firſt he do not, yet at length he geueth it to hys elected at theyr death, as the Prophet Abacucke told a fore hand, when he ſayed, Lord when they ſhal be neare to the death at the latter ende, betwene thys way and the other, thou wylt make knowen to them Chriſt and his great benefits, and wilt open to them the boſome of thy graces by Ieſu Chriſt our Lord.

               And if it wer ſo, that by force thou ſhuld he drawen to the court of iuſtice, crye oute wyth Eſay, & ſay to Chriſt: O Lord I ſuffer violence,Eſ. xxxviii. make anſwere for me, healpe me, forſake me not, I choſe and wil haue the for my attorney and ſpeach manne: not becauſe thou ſhuld defend my iuſte accomptes, and true reckenynges, for I haue none ſuch, but to the intente thou ſhuld take my ſynnes for thyne, and reward me with thine innocency holynes and ryghtwyſenes. Thou haſt all readye ſatiſſfied for me on the croſſe and appoynted me by adopcion to be the ſonne of God, wherfore I cānot be damned, no not one ſhalbe found that dare accuſe me,Rom. viii. being one of goddes elected.
               Moreouer if thou be myneded aud wyllynge to appeare wythoute daunger at the benche of goddes ryghtewyſenes dyſpoyle
 fyrſte thy ſelfe of the olde Adam, and apparel the with Chriſte (as Paul exhorteth vs) & thou ſhalbe ſafe.Colloſſ. iii. For in ſo muche as thou haſte embraced him for thine own, thou can not be damned although thou haddeſt committed al the ſinnes of the worlde. As a woman greate with childe cannot be puniſhed no more can thou,Apoca. iii. if thou haue Chriſt in thy harte,Ihon. iii. or rather (as Chriſte ſayeth) he that be leueth in the ſon is not iudged he is ſo aſſured of hys ſaluacion, that there nedeth no examinacion to be hadde of him, he is one of Chriſtes mēbers, and hath his ſpirit, wherfore he can no more be dampned then Chriſt becauſe he is knit to him by liuelye faythe.
               If it be ſo that God woulde make there with the a reckenynge, ſaye to hym howe thou haſt made it wyth Chriſt,Eſaye. liii. for as he put on Chriſt al our iniquities and ſinnes (as Eſaye ſayeth) and with greate loue accepted them for hys owne, and bounde him ſelfe to make ſatiſfaction for them. Wherfore thou ſhalt ſay. Lorde if thou haſte anye reconing or matter agaynſte me, make it with Chriſt he knoweth wel how to anſwere aud can declare that he hathe ſatiſfied for them.
               In caſe be that any muſt be dampned for the ſynnes I haue doone, it is Chriſte, that muſte be dampned, and not I good Lorde,
 for albeit I am he that commytted them, neuertheles Chriſte bounde hym ſelfe to ſatiſfye for them, and that by conſente and good wyll of hys father, wherefore who ſo euer beleueth lyuelye in Chriſte is all to gether ſafe and ſure.
               Beſyde thys if God wolde needes make the audite and accompt wyth vs, and wold ſaye: I am not contente wyth Chriſtes ſatisfactyō for you.

               ¶The .x. Sermon.
               By what meane to come to heauen.
               
                   Experyence proueth that euerye creature hathe naturallye a deſyre and appetite to reſort to it own proper place and manſyon, and namely man, becauſe he is the moſt ſouerein creature of al other.
               And for ſo much as our natyue country is not heare vpon the earth,Heb. xv. Colloſſi. i. but in heauen is our place of reaſt (conſideringe that al men haue thys deſyre to go to heauen) I take it to be expedyente to weigh and po
                     •
                  der how we maye go together.
               God hathe geuen vs Chriſt for an only
                     •
                   mirrour, glas, ſquier, Maiſter, and guide, wherfore who
                     •
                  ſo
                     •
                  is willinge to walke thyther I meane to heauen, muſte go the ſame path, that he hathe gone and troden before vs, becauſe he knoweth ye way moſt perfectly, and taught it to vs wythout any gile as wel by his examples, as by his words, therfore he that entēdeth, to go to heauen muſt follow him. And firſte as he beynge in the ſhape and fourme of God was not proud, nor an arrogāt vſurper, nor aſcribed to him ſelf that he myght conueniently haue done,Phillip. ii. but contrariwiſe, was louely humble, of no reputacion, and to ke vpō him the ſhape of a ſeruaunte, or rather of a ſynner, and God layed on hym all oure wyckedneſſe,Eſay. liii. ye and moſt louingly admitted and allowed them
 for hys own, as though he had commytted them hym ſelf.
               Now in lyke maner, a Chriſten man being al ready regenerate and born agayn by Chriſt, & graffed into him by a liuing faith. Commeth down from heauen, that is from hys own pryde, and falſe excellency, for (as Chriſt ſayeth) no man goeth vp into heauen but he that commeth down,Ihon. iii. that is the ſon of man and hys members. Wherfore by & by as a Chriſten man hath a liuely taſt and feling of Chriſt, and his great bene fyt he is humble, counteth him ſelf of no value & nothing in his reputacion, for whē he ſeeth by deuine influence, the mekenes of Chriſt, his liberality, pacience, loue, goodnes, innocē
                  cy, wyth other of his vertues, he is of force conſtrayned to feele his own pride, vnkindnes, vnpacientnes, wyckednes, vngodlynes, and his other iniquities. And as God put vpon Chriſt al our ſynnes, and he with moſt tender loue receiued them: ſo wil this Chriſten man aſcribe to him ſelf al the offē
                  ces of the world: by reaſon that he perceaueth, that if God had with drawen frō him hys grace and had not born him vp, but miniſtred to him occaſion and oportunity to offend, ther had not ben a ſyn in al ye world but he had don it wherfore he wyl attribute
 to hym ſelf al, as though he had committed them in dede ſo that albeit in Chriſt, and by Chriſt he perceiueth him ſelf innocent and ſafe, not withſtanding of him ſelf he taketh it, that he is moſt damned, and greateſt ſynner of al the world and is forced to ſay that (whych Paul ſpake long a go) Chriſt came into the worlde to ſaue ſynners,i, Timo, i. whereof I am one of the chefe.
               The ſecond act of Chriſt was, that, after he was thus humbled, clothed wyth oure frayle nature, borne, and ſhewed forth to ye world, he liued al together for hys neyghbour, and ſought only y• glory of his father and ſaluacyon of hys brethren, without any regard or reſpect to hym ſelf (& cauſe whye is) for that he was ſo full of loue,Ihon. i. grace, fauour, truth, godlines, and all light, vertue, and perfeccion, wherfore cōſidering he had no nede to enrych hym ſelf, he lyued holy to the wealth and benefyte of others, as Paul ſayeth Chriſt hath not pleaſed hym ſelfe he was inflamed in ſuch wyſe wyth a feruent deſyre to ſaue the world,Colloſſi. i. Rom. xv. for the glory of his father, that he being cleane ſwalowed vp in God, had no mynde nor conſyderacyon of hym ſelf. Nowe in ſemblable forte that true Chriſten man, that ſeeth hym ſelf the ſonne and heyre of God, as Lord of all ſtudyeth,
 not to lyue to hys own vſe, but is holy ben
                     •
                   to the benefitinge of hys brethren for gods glory, and beinge as it were chaunged into theyr nature feeleth al theyr good, and euyl as Paule dyd.
               Next enſueth the thyrd acte, that lyke as ye world perſecuted Chriſt, ſo it purſue hym and that becauſe in ſauynge his neighbour and ſekyng the glory of God, he auaunceth and ſet forthe the grace, the goſpell, and the great mercy of God: thruſting down ſubmittyng, throwing down to the ground, & makyng nothynge of man: and becauſe the world repyneth at thys, therfore immediatly foloweth perſecutyon, in lyke caſe therefore as the hoole life of Chriſt was one contynual perſecution becauſe it was godly, ſo chaūceth fytly and agreably to a true chriſtian, that magnifieth the greate benefyte, whych we haue receiued by Chriſte,Actes▪ ix. which thing is open and manifeſt in ſundry places of the Actes of the Apoſtles. For immediatly as the Apoſtles had preached the goſpel, they wer purſued, and ſo the caſe goeth in thys our time. More ouer as Chriſt was done on the croſſe, from whence, he wolde not come down, althoughe in ſcorne it was ſayed to hym,Mat. xxvii that if he were the ſonne of God, he ſhoulde come downe of the croſſe,
 and they woulde beleue hym, but becauſe he was the ſonne of god, he wold not come downe, but adyde there, and wyth his own death make perfect our ſaluacion, in lyke maner alſo a Chriſten man muſt be tranſformed and changed into Chriſt crucified, ſo that wyth Paule he may ſay I am crucified with Chriſte,Galath. ii
                        •
                     
                   in ſuch wiſe alſo knitte to hym on the croſſe, that nothinge is hable to part me from the loue of God,Rom. viii. whych is in Chriſte Ieſus.
               Furthermore as Chriſt dyed on y• croſſe ſo a Chriſten man, that lyueth in Chriſt, dieth to the world in ſuch ſort, that he paſſeth not of riches, honour, dignity, kinred, frēds worldly pleaſures, or proſperity cōſidering that he ſeeth by fayth that he is ſafe, happy, and ſonne, and heyre of God, yea euen as Chriſt was buryed, ſo is he, ſo that y• world counteth him not only for a thing dead,Rom. vi. but rotten, ſtynkyng and lothſome, wherfore he muſt ſay wyth Paule,Galath. iii the world is crucifyed to me, and I to the world. He beſyde this muſt ryſe with Chriſte in newnes of lyfe, lintug after another maner then be did before that he was regenerate by Chriſte,Rom. vi. becauſe he is be commen ſpirituall he lyueth to the glory of God.
               And thus finally with Chriſt he aſcēdethColloſſ. iii.
                   into heuē ſtāding, as touching his thoughts affeccions, and deſyres, aboue in his celeſtial country, ſo that he ſay with Paul our conuerſacion is in heauen,Phillip. iii. where he enioyeth & taketh pleaſure and comforte in God. To whome be alwayes al honoure and glorye, through Ieſu Chriſt our Lord. Amen.

And he right louingly, although he were a verye innocent, toke them for hys own, and was contented to ſatiſfy for oure offences, to ſuffer that we had deſerued, and dye vpon the cros, according to his fathers

He was contended that vppon hym ſhuld come al thoſe infrmies, ſlaūders & rebukes, which we haue deſerued for our ſyns, which thing Dauid ſingnified in ſpirit in the parſon of Chriſt where he ſayeth,Pſa. lxviii. the rebukes, and reproches, wherwith they ſlaunderd the, fel al vpon me, yea and thoſe curſes alſo, that wer due to vs fel vpō him, (as Paule ſayeth) he hath redemed vs from the curſſe,Galath, iii in that he became a curſt for vs, And lyke a godly ſhepherd hauyng on hys backe the loſt ſhepe (for he hath his kingdō vpon his ſhulders) hath he born our ſynnes on the croſſe,Eſay. vi.

It was gods wyl and mynd, that he which was moſt innocēt ſhould be don on ye croſſe as though he wer not only a ſynner but euē lyn it ſelf and thus (as Daniell propheſyed was iniquity conſumed) and in one day god toke it out of the world, according to ye propheſy of Zachary,Zachar. v. wherfore ſaynt Ihon ſaieth he appeared to take away our fyns,Ihon. iii. and ſaynt Ihon Baptiſt ſayeth of Chriſt that he is the lambe of God yt taketh away the ſins of the world.Heb. i. Therfor when Chriſt ſuffered moſt louingly al that, which we haue deſerued, he ſatiſfied for vs, and purged vs from our ſynnes. He after the manner of the prodygal ſonne, of an excedyng loue, yt he bare to the ſoul, when he had geuen hys deuyne treaſures of grace to the very open ſynners and harlots and had taken to hym ſelfe our ſynnes, as if he had done them hym ſelf, he made prayer to hys father that he wold pardon them to hym, and to hym he pardoned them, for we were not worthy: nether wold he yeld vp hys ſpirit tyl fyrſt he had bowed down hys head that is vntyl he had moued

Cor. xi. not becauſe he committed them, but becauſe he admitted them for his own & ſo hath he ſatiſfied for thē, not only ſufficiently, but alſo more thē was requiſite. For to God is one teare of Chriſt more pleaſaunt, then al the ſins of the world dyſpleaſaunt, and that lyfe & death of his were more to the honour of god, thē our life was to his diſhonour, yea he hath not only ſatiſfyed for our ſynnes, but hath purchaſed for vs lyfe euer laſtynge.
               But happely wylt thou ſay, then nede I to take no paynes nor trauail to ſatiſfy for my ſins, nor to deſerue paradiſe, I mai take myne eaſe, or do what euil that liketh me geuing me to pleſure, and good chere, for if it be as thou ſaieſt, I cannot but be ſaued. I anſwere thus. Firſt I ſay yt truth it is thou oughteſt not to labour thy ſelf for the entēt to ſatyſfy for thy ſyns nor yet to deſerue paradyſe: for that is only Chriſtes offyce, nor thou canſt haue any ſuch entent without doing greate iniurye and wronge to God, but wheras thou ſayeſt, yt thou wold lyue idelye or do euel, after that Chriſt hath now delyuered the from al euil, and purchaſed the
 the greateſt felicity: I make the anſwere on thys wyſe. If caſe wer that one were led to the gallowes for hys rybaldry and noughtynes, and hys Lorde or maiſter of mere fauour and good wil ſhuld delyuer hym, and count him for his ſonne, and yet would ſay: My Lord or maſter hath deliuered me frō al euell, and taken me for hys ſonne & heyre therfore wyl I go my way and be idle, and in folowing myne own luſtes, and wyll do hym wronge: how thinke you, in this caſe, be not theſe wycked wordes? euen the lyke ſayeſt thou, Chriſt hath delyuered me from hel, and made me the ſon of God, and heyre of heauen, wherfore I wyl ſtand lyke an idle parſō, or rather do more euil, Chriſt certes died not for the, nor ſatiſfied for thy dets nor yet merited for the paradiſe to the intēt thou ſhulde ſtand idle, commit ſyn, and become a ſtarke rybald, but that thou, ſeynge hys great loue, and how greatly ſynne dyſpleaſed hym ſeeing he was willynge to dye becauſe to take them out of the world, ſhuld no more do ſyn, but honour hym, loue him, thanke hym, put thy truſt in hym, and work vertuous and good works plenteouſly, not as a bonde ſeruaunte to eſcape hel, ſythen Chriſt hath deliuered the, ne yet to get paradyce, the which Chriſte hathe purchaſed for
 the, but as a uatural ſonne for the glorye of God, moued thereto by mocion of faythe, loue, and ſpirit, not by mans wytte, ſenſualitie, or thy behofe or cōmodity. More ouer eyther thou beleueſt that Chriſt hath ſatiſſied for the or not, if thou beleue not, that he hath delyuered the from hel and gotten the Paradiſe, if thou be wyſe, thou wylt ſearch to healpe thy ſelf, and ſo wylt thou not be yble, muchles wylt thou commit ſinnes: but rather enforce thy ſelfe to make ſatiſfaction for thy ſelfe and to deſerue paradiſe, which is a thing impoſſible, but if thou beleue liue lye, that he had ſo loued the, that to ſaue the he died on the croſſe, thou ſhuld be conſtrained to loue hym agayne, and to doo for his glory, maruelous workes plenteouſly aud redily to beleue that we are ſaued by Chriſt maketh not vs negligent and naughtye but feruente and holye.
               Let vs therefore render thankes to oure Lorde God, ſeinge he hathe wyth ſo greate loue ſaued vs by ſo hyghe rych, happy, & gloryous meane. To whome be alwaye all honoure, laude and glorye through Ieſu Chriſt out Lorde.

                  et it, it ſhuld neuer be preached, & that is becauſe it ſemeth thē to geue offēce and ingender cōfuſion amonge the people, ☞ I cannot denye, that many curiouſe perſons wyth theyr darcke natural lyght (willing to ſe thynges ſupernatural that cannot be ſene but by fayth) do fal into thouſandes of errours, and cauſe other to fall into the lyke. Al that they maye imagine by force of wyt, pleaſynge to theyr owne corrupt reaſon (of that hyghe ſecrete) they thyncke it to be true, wythout other teſtimonye of holye ſcripture. And thereby haue intangled their braynes, darkened theyr myndes, and offen ded theyr conſciences. Curyoſytye is an vnſatiable beaſt, it would pearce thorowe all thynges, and yet cānot get out of his darke and intricate laborinthes, nor once lyft vpthe heade to deuyne ſecretes. And if we ſuffer our ſelues to be guyded of it (in thinges ſpeciallye ſupernaturall) neyther wyll it at
 any tyme be ſatiſfied, nor we ſhall neuer perceyue the trueth. For immediatly after it paſſeth the borders of the natural lyghte, it goeth alwaies blinded and at aduenture. Therefore it muſt be put aſyde and (bryngynge hys vnſaciable wyl to an ende) walke by fayth to deuyne ſecrettes honoring them wythout further dyſcuſſion. And if we be prouoked to ſerch them out by the wantonnes of humayne wyt: we oughte to remember that,Proue. xxv which is written: He that ſearcheth the maieſtie of God, ſhalbe ouercome with the glorye thereof. It is our offyce, to be cō
                  tēt, with as much as God hath vouchſafed to open vnto vs in the ſacred Scripturs, in the whych, he hath geuen vs lyght ſufficyently, But note, that as it is euel to be curiouſe in wyllynge to knowe more then that whych in the ſcripture is conteyned, and to vs reueled, ſo is it alſo euell, to be ignoraunt and not to ſeke to vnderſtande as much as therin is: for that in them ſpeaketh the holye goſt who gyueth none offence but edifyeth In them is writen nothyng pernicious, vnprofitable, or vayne, but only commodious and neceſſary. Neyther ought it to offende any man, when it is ſpoken of, in the maner that Paulle ſpeaketh of it. And we neyther maye nor ought,Galath. ii. to be more circumſpecte in
 ſpeakyng therof then Paule, ye then God, that ſpake in hym. Thynckeſt thou haplye that Paule (yea rather Chriſte that lyued in hym, and moued hym to wryte) dyd erre in yt he wrote of it in ſuche ſort, as he dyd? The holy ghoſt would neuer haue gyuen vnderſtandynge thereof in the holy ſcripture, if it hadde bene euell. Thou wylte ſay, the preachynge of it in ſuch maner as Paule wrytteth: geueth offence, as it is euidente. I anſwere that Chriſt crucified, was an offence to the Hebrues:i. Corin. i. therfore the Apoſtles did euell to preache it, The goſpel ſemed folyſhnes to the wyſe of the world: And therefore it ſhoulde not be taughte. The truth is dyſpleaſaunt to the falſe chriſtians, they fynde offence of the goſpell, and Iuſtificacion by Chriſt, ſhould it then be kepte in ſilence?
               Wherfore wilt yu that we holde oure peace of that thyng whych Paule writteth? How can the wordes of the holy goſt offend, that haue bene pronounced and wrytten onelye for oure ſaluacion? If thou be offended therwyth, it is not becauſe it geueth the occaſiō but for that thou takeſt it without any gift. Neyther oughte we thereof to ceaſſe, more then the Apoſtles left preachynge, thoughe many were offended therwyth. Thou wylt ſaye, to preache the Goſpell is neceſſarye.
 Wherfore that oughte not to be lefte for offence: and I ſaye that predeſtinacion is a great parte of the Goſpell. Wouldeſt thou not thynke thys a goodlye Goſpell or glad tydynges, that God from wythout begynnyng, had by his mere grace, and by Chriſt crucified, elected vs to be hys chyldren, and that we be ſure in hys handes? It is a thing moſte neceſſarye, to preache thoſe good newes, in the whyche ther is diſcouered vnto vs the exceadynge goodnes of God, that aboue all other thynges doeth moue vs to be ennamored of hym. And he that is offended wyth predeſtinacion, preached in the maner it ought to be, is alſo offended wyth the Goſpell. 
                     •
                  uoweſt thou (that whyche in dede doth hurt, althoughe it appeare not to the blynde and frantyke worlde) that anye man preacheth it after yt humayne doctrin? But it maye be thou wylt ſaye, let vs come therefore to the particulars. Doeth it not ſeeme to the offence, to preach that god hath electe ſome and not other ſome? He that hereth theſe wordes, wyll thyncke God to be parciall. I aunſwere and fyrſt I ſaye, that God cannot erre: nor wyll otherwyſe then iuſtly: Yea hys wyll is ſo ryghte, that as he alway wylleth any thing, it is euen by that wyllynge moſt iuſt. Therefore none ſhould
 be offended wyth hys workes, for as much as he maye dyſpoſe vs after hys own way, and ſhewe hys pleaſure vpō vs more then yt potter vpon hys pottes: and al with iuſtyce & equite. For what bond hath god with vs? Moreouer,Roma. ix. by the ſynnes of Adam we are al loſt, aud he myghte iuſtlye damne vs al, but he ſaueth as manye as hym pleaſeth: and yet we complayne, where we are not worthy by ſufferyng al puniſhmente to ſet furthe the bryghtnes of hys glorye. Yea it oughte to be preached that God hathe elected ſome, and not other ſome: for to ſmite to the earth the wiſdome of man, and to make him al humble and ſubiecte to God.Roma. iii. Nowe is it not neceſſary to be knowē that we ſhal not all be ſaued, and that many ſhalbe damned? And conſequentlye God hath many electe and manye reiected. Thou wouldeſte ſaye, thys ſhoulde gyue no occacion of offence, if it were preached, that thoſe that he hathe choſen, are choſen for theyr merites, and thoſe he hath forſaken, are forſaken for their wickednes but thei ſay yt thoſe he hath elect, are elected by hys mere grace, wythout workes, and that oure election and ſaluacyon dependeth hollye vpon God. And thys gyueth the offence to the worlde.Epheſi. i. Roma. ix. I anſwere. If this be offence, Paul hath geuen it hym ſelfe, becauſe it is the doctrin of him
 ye rather of the holy goſt. Wylt thou be offended if Paule magnifie y• fre mercye,Rom. viii. Epheſi. i. ſeyng God hath elected vs to the laud of hys glory, as he wrytteth? We cannot magnify it ſufficiently. But thou feareſt it ſhould be lauded aud exalted to much. If it were told thee thou were elected by thy workes, then would I thou ſhuldeſt be offended, for that it woulde make the beleue thy ſaluacion, to depend vpon thy ſelfe, wherby thou ſhouldeſt be begiled.Oſe. xiii. For of thy ſelfe cōmeth thy damnacion, and of God thy ſaluacion, Yea as often as thou thynckeſt thy ſaluacion in anye parte to depende vpon thy ſelfe, it driueth the, eyther to dyſpare or to be exalted in preſumptyon. And in ſuch caſe thou canneſt neuer put in God al thy hoope, nor all thy loue, neyther haue perfect quyetneſſe of mynde, nor of conſcyence. Thou wouldeſt ſay, that who ſo knoweth that God aboue is reſolued vpon all thynges: wareth colde in well doyng, and ſayth, what nede I more to trauayle, God hath immutably determined and reſolued all that is to be, I maye paſſe my tyme in pleaſure, for if I be electe I ſhall euery way be ſaued. And if I be reprobate, I cannot ſaue my ſelfe, thoughe I neuer ceaſed to axe it, on my bare kuees.
               Thou perceyueſt not, that he which ſayeth
 ſo, doth dyſcouer hym ſelfe ſhewynge that he neuer dyd good workes, & yet he would hys ſaluacion ſhoulde depende vppon hym ſelfe. Thys ſort of men, if they do any good (as they call it) it is to wyn heauen, and not for the glorye of God. Therefore if they ſhoulde beleue that theyr ſaluacion and elec

The electe doo neuer become colde, but are the more feruent, by hearynge that their election and ſaluacion is onely in the handdes of God, they knowe by fayeth, that the Lord loueth them ſo much (ſpeciallye ſynce Chriſte hath dyed for theym on the croſſe) that they are ſure of theyr ſaluacion. Yea they feele ſo much the goodnes of God in Chriſte, and by Chriſt, that if it were poſſyble (whyle that ſpirituall felynge dyd remayne in them) that they could beleue them ſelues to be reprobate (for as muche as by thys,i.

Cor. xi. & not to feele in Chriſt the great goodnes of God. Sathan is he that being tranſformed into the ſimilitude of an Aungell of lyght, trauayleth to perſwade that our eleccion dependeth vpon vs. This was the opinion of Pelagius: and the Pelagians are they that be offended with this great mercy of God: they thinke that God nether may, can, or wyll do other then reaſon. Then of force muſte it be good to be preached,Eſay. lx. to the end it may be knowen, yt the time is already come of the couenaunt and promiſed peace that he which hath eares to vnderſtād, may vnderſtād, as haue ye ſhepe of chriſt yt heare their paſtour, It is alſo good to be ſpokē of to the ende yt that be not hyd but declared,Ihon. x. which (by ye wyll of God & for oure profit) is written therof in holye ſcripture: & yt the ſpecial cure yt god hath of vs, may be knowen,
 & how we ſhuld ſerue him frely as chyldren, & not as timerous ſeruauntes & hyrelinges. Yea & that it may be vnderſtād, that God (being abſolutelie the Lord) may do al that he wil, & what he willeth is iuſt, & to ye end alſo, ye in our electiō may be diſcouered to vs, in ſuperabūdāt maner▪ his fre mercy, & that it may be ſene how we are preuented by innumerable benifites, & alſo yt mā maye know yt he is only vaniti, & euer an vnprotitable ſeruaunt.Pſ. xxxviii Paradiſe wer litle worth if with our workes we could wyn it, but it is the inheritaunce of ſonnes, & not a rewarde for ſeruauntes. I wolde knowe what men wold ſay, if God ſhulde ſaye to them: chuſe whether ye wyl ſtand to my eleccion and ye which I haue determined for you, or yt I diſanulling (if this wer poſſible) al that I haue purpoſed to do with you, ſhulde reſolue me holi to put it in you.

 And therfore for euery reſpecte, euerye one ſhuld ſtand to gods determinaciō, it it wer but to doo honoure to him. It is a thynge more magnificent, and to God more conuenient, to geue paradiſe by fre mercy, then if he ſhuld ſel it: his liberality is therby moſt diſcouered. Then for his greater glorye I would alwayes ſaye, God hathe geuen me thys. And alſo for my owne commodytye, that wheras now I hold my ſaluacion ſure (for that I know it hāgeth only vpon god) I wold thinke me dāned, or at the leaſt preſuming on my ſelf, ſtande indoute, if in the leaſt point it did repend vppon me, becauſe God in comparably doth loue me more thē I can do my ſelfe. Yea, I am the greateſt enemy & traitor to my ſelf y• mai be. Therfor mē ought by euery conſideracion to cōtent then that their ſaluacion doth ſtād in the hād of God: yea in taking y• whole cure of vs, he hath ſhewed vs moſt dere loue he hathe wylled vs to be ſure of it. And therefore he wolde not truſt to vs, knowinge we are ſo vnpefect, yt if we had paradiſe in our hands we ſhould let it fal to the earth wher nowe we are ſure knowinge that al our ſyns can not let the deuine eleccion, neither quenche or diminiſh the diuine charitie. Yea, here of our ſins toke occaſion to be ſhewed with exceſſe
 of more loue.Rom. v. We are not by this inuited to more Idleneſſe, nor to watche when we ſhall haue Manna from heauen, nether to be wickedly occupyed, but we are drawē and moued ſo much more to loue him, as he is diſcouered to vs by more bounty and charitie. But thoſe that are not by Chriſte regenerate, ar of ſo baſe & vyle a minde through ſinne, that they cannot thincke God to be ſo liberall as to geue heauē without our workes. But they ought at the leaſte to thynke, that to bye it the bloud of Chriſt is ſufficiēt without adioyninge therto theyr workes to hoote: which ſurely are rich iuels to be mingled with hys. God is ſo frāke, that he hath geuen vs Chriſt, and in him al thinges, and canſt thou not thinke he hath geuen the heauen?Rom. viii. It is alſo our greater glory, that God hath loued vs ſo muche, that hys own ſelfe hath willed to take the care & charge of our ſaluacion. And ſo to that ende hathe wylled his only ſonne to die vpon the croſſe, ſo that if with all our trauaile we might enter into heauen by our ſelues: the glory only of the croſſe is a far greater glory then any other which by our ſelues we could attaine. Yea, there is no other trew glory, then to glorye to be ſo much loued of God, that he hath to ſaue vs, put his ſonne vppon the croſſe. He
 may not dwel in hys own loue, that willeth to be happy, and only glorye in God. If we myght glory of our ſelues, we ſhould haue wherof to ware proude and prefer our ſelues afore oure brethren, where otherwyſe we ſhould haue occaſion to be humble, and geue to God all honoure and glorye as to him it apperteineth.i. Timo. i. And further ſuch as beleue thē ſelues to be by grace elected, ſaued ſonnes of God, heyres and ſure therof, not only becauſe ther remaineth no more to get (God in Chriſt hauing geuen them all) but alſo by the great vnderſtandyng they haue of the goodnes of the Lord: they are cōſtrained to worke as childrē for the glori of their father, and not for their owne gaine, and ſo alſo ſure of their ſaluacion, with Chriſt thei turne them withal their force, to ſeke the ſaluacion of their brother: they demaund alſo grace with a bolder ſpirite and confidence, ſence they are it not for theyr owne lucre, but for the honour of God,Ephe. i. Rom. vi. Pſal. xxxii. and to his laud and glory: ſo that in the worldes to come, may be ſene the abundant riches of his fre mercye. Moreouer ſuch hoope to be hearde for that they thinke not to deſerue grace, nether put their truſt in their owne woorkes, but in the goodnes of God, beinge inſpired and moued there to by the holye goſt. Such
 alſo as feele that our ſaluaciō depēdeth not vpon vs, but our damnacion, and that it ſtā
                  deth wholy in the hande of God: are forced to turne their backes to thē ſelues, & theyr faces to God, Wher as the cōtrary belefe, wold make y• cōtrary operaciō, they would withdraw them from God, and ſeke to reſt with hope in them ſelues: alſo if God had elected vs with this condicion: If we wolde do well, we ſhould be vnder the lawe contrary to Paul,Epheſi. i. neither we ſhould be ſaued, for the law ſaueth not but worketh wrath, and is the miniſter of curſing and damnacion. Let him therfore that luſteth haue Chriſt for his iudge, for I wil none of him, but as a ſauiour. If our election by fre mercy dyd harme vs, he wold not thē haue elected vs ſo. But note them that thinke to haue theyr eleccioon in their owne hands, & thou ſhalt ſe that thei are in their owne loue and truſt, preſumtuous, and full of vice: and yet for all thys they be ſo blind and arrogant, that they wyl haue heauen by iuſtice.

               ¶Howe excellente oure eleccyon is.
               PAul magnifieth oure eleccion, firſte in his behalfe that hath elected vs, ſaying We are elected nether by man nor Angell, bnt by God: Hyer can not he go. Then concernynge hym that elected vs, our eleccion is moſt excellente. And lykewiſe concernyng the circumſtance of time, although aboue there is properlye no courſe of time. He elected vs (as Paule wryteth) before the conſtitucion of the worlde:Epheſi. i. meanyng from wythoute begynnynge, ſooner coulde he not electe vs.
               And moreouer he ſaith, that he elected vs which are moſt baſe, moſt vile, moſt abiect, worms in compariſon of him. By the ſinne of Adam we were all defyled, infected, in firme, frayle, blynde, malignaunte, full of venum cōtrary to god, enemies & rebels▪ ſo that a thyng more myſerable coulde not haue binne choſen. Paule doth alſo magnifye oure election, in reſpect of the dignitye, to the which we are elected, a

                  d ſayeth, he hath not choſen vs to be hys ſeruauntes or frendes, but to be hys children, nothing to god cā be more nyghe, entire and deare, thē
                   his children, nether is it poſſible to imagine a greater dignitie. It doth include al other vertues and goodnes, it is ſo hyghe and excellent. Being then elected from ſo miſerable an eſtate, to be the ſōnes of god. He hath alſo choſen vs to be the brethren of Chriſte & therby with him coheires of god:Rom. viii. yea the worlde is oures. Chryſt with al his gyftes, al that is the fathers is the ſonnes, therfore al is ours yt is gods, whoſe goodes we mai dyſpoſe as children their fathers. And bycauſe we ſhoulde ſhame to be the ſonnes of God, not hauinge the maners, graces, and vertues conuenient to ſuch a dygnitie, therfore not onlye oure heauenlye father, hath choſen vs to be his ſonnes, but hath bleſſed vs, not wyth wordes onlye, but wyth effectes, not as Iſaac bleſſed Iacob or Eſau▪ but wyth all ſpirituall bleſſinge in thinges celeſtiall.Ephe. i. Colloſſi. i. And ſo accordyng to Paule, hathe made vs mete to be partakers of ye feloweſhip of lyght, & delyuering vs frō the power of darkenes, hath ledde vs into the kingedome of hys beloued ſonne: God then withoute beginninge did determyne to iuſtifye, glorifye,Roma. viii and magnifye thoſe that he hadde elect, and euen ſo he hathe done: as Paule wryteth, who alſo exalteth our election for that cauſe, ſainge: that it was not our good
 worckes, which God forſawe wythout beginning, that were the cauſe of our electiō, but he choſe vs by mere mercye, accordyng to the decreed purpoſe of his owne wyll, to the laud and glorye of his mercie, we were not then choſen bycauſe we were Holye, but becauſe we ſhoulde be holly bi his election, and to ſhewe in the worldes to come, the abundaunte riches of his grace.Epheſ. i. ii. Paule alſo ſhewyth the worthines of our electiō, by reſpecte of the dignitie of the perſon by whoſe meanes we are choſen, and ſaithe, he hath willed, that betwene vs and him there ſhuld be our mediator, nether he wold it to be an angel,i. Timo. ii. Ephe. i. but Chriſt the ſōne of God. He meaneth not onlie a mediator with wordes but with his owne bloud, and death Paule doth exalt our electiō as concerning ye end. For bicauſe he hathe elected vs for his ſonnes, to the end we may taſte (not only in the life to come, but alſo in this preſent) thinges ſo highe, happye, rych, & pure, that the eye hathe not ſene, nor the eare hath not heard, nor into the hart of man (being carnal) hath at anye tyme enterd,i. Corin. ii. he hath then elected vs to the ende (that regenerate by Chriſt Ieſu) we ſhuld walke to God by good workes, y• we maie be holye and inreprehēſible,Ephe. ii. before his preſence. Our election is alſo excellente
 by the ſuerty therof, for that the elect are in the handes of God.Ephe. i. Ihon, x. Therefore ſhal not thei peryſhe, as Chriſt ſaith, yea they can not peryſhe, euen as they can not be pluckte oute of hys handes. Therefore oure election is mooſte happye, ſo that nothynge oughte ſo muche to bee reioyſed in, as to bee the elected and choſen of God. Therfore it is read, the diſciples returning to Chriſt, and reioiſinge with greate gladnes, that euen the veray deuelles were ſubiecte to them,Luke. x. Chryſte amonge the reſte of wordes, bade them thei ſhulde not reioyſe of the ſubiection of the deuels, but that their names were wrytten in heauen: by which wordes, he did ſhew, that we ought to make a ſynguler Ioye of our elecciō, for that includeth, and bringeth with it the ſinne of all our wealth, ſince then that our eleccion is ſo excellent, ryche, ſure, and hapy. Let vs pray to God to geue vs lighte and grace, to perceyue it, to the end, that taſting in it (with the ſpirit) the myghtie goodnes of God, we may render him al laud honor: and glory, by Ieſu Chriſt our lord, Amē

                  lect or not, nor alſo whether he be in the fauour of God: we may only haue ther of an obſcure, confuſed, vncertein and faylyng knowledge by cōiecture of ye outward lyfe and workes, of whom Chriſt ſpeaking, ſayd.Math. vii. Ye ſhall knowe them by their frutes. But for aſmuch as we ſee not the hertes of
 men,i. Corin. ii. Luke. xvi. which oftentymes (although wythin they are vngodly and abhominacion itſelfe in the ſyght of God, neuertheles coueringe them with the veyle of hipocriſie maſkinge therin) they appeare to be ſainctes. Therfore without ſpeciall oracle, we can haue no certeine knowledge therof. But I ſaye yt euery elect, whyle he is in this preſent lyfe, beinge come to the yeres of diſcreſſion, maye, and ought to know it of him ſelf, not by natural lyght (by meanes wherof thinges ſupernatural can not be perceiued, as the excellente diuine wyl toward vs) but by faithe, without other ſpeciall priuilege. And this not wt hauing reſpect to them ſelues, where is nothing ſene but worthy damnation, neyther with cōſideringe or beholding thē ſelues in God without Chriſt, for in yt caſe he muſte ſhew himſelf to vs a iuſt iudgful of wrath, then we neither ſe our ſelues hys ſōnes, nor in fauour. But with liuely fayth beholding both our ſelues, & God in Chriſt, we ſe our ſelues to be in the fauour of god, & his elect ſonnes, & god to be pacified with vs in loue and our only father. Such then as liuely beleue, yt Chriſt for thē hath died vpō ye croſſe, haue the holy goſt within them, & are in the fauour of God, bicauſe that faith doth purifie the herte. And further I ſay, that al they
 which in this preſent lyfe do beleue liuelye in Chriſt (yea were it for a moment of time) ſhalbe ſaued. They are electe aud ſonnes of God, and may be ſure and certeine, of their ſaluation. And y• this is true, the words of ſainte Ihon ought to ſuffiſe, whiche ſaythe, that he is the ſonne of God, therefore electe and ſaued, who ſo beleueth Ieſu Chriſte to be the ſonne of God.i. Ihon. v. And alſo Chriſt ſayde who ſo beleueth in me hath lyfe euerlaſting neuertheleſſe it may clearlye be proued that none beleueth liuelye in Chriſte, but he that beleueth Chriſt to be wholy his rightwiſenes and that he is ſaued thorowlye by him, and he that ſeeth this with ſupernatural vnderſtandinge hauinge no reſpect to him ſelf nor his workes, but only to the goodnes of God diſcouered in Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, cānot by any meanes be diſceiued, becauſe that light which he hath to be in the fauor of God, elect to ſaluacion, can not growe but onlye of the bountye of God, conſydered in Chriſt, wherof can ſpring no falſe nor deceitfull knowledge. Full well may he be be giled and ſhalbe, that doth behold his workes, and by them thincketh that he is in the fauour of God and his ſōne. But ſeing him ſelfe in Chriſt ſaued, choſen & in the fauour of God, it muſte nedes be ſaid, that he ſeeth
 the truthe, and that which is once trewe although it were but for the twincke of an eie muſt be ſaide to be euer true, he then which beleueth in Chriſte, were it but a mynute of an houre, in perceyuynge of hym ſelfe elect by Chriſt, ſeeth that which is true, therfore ſhall it euer be true, that he is one of the legitima
                     •
                   ſonnes of God, ſo that the ſame his faythe, be not in anye maner founded vpon him ſelf, nor his own worckes, but in chriſt, and the diuine excellence, and that it be not a certeine trifleinge, lighte, baren and deade opinion, but a liuely faithe. It muſt be ſaid then that Iudas had neuer perfect faith, nether was elect to ſaluaciō, although he was choſen to the apoſtelſhippe, and the like ſay I of al y• reprobate: al ſuch thē as haue had at ani time liuely belefe to be ſaued bi chriſt may be ſure of their ſaluation. And ſo alſo they, whiche haue once at the leaſt bene perfectely geuen to God, and committed to his gouernaunce, vpon the couenaunte, that he ſhall ſerue him ſelfe of them accordynge to his owne purpoſe, and with truſte that by Chriſt and his mere goodnes he hath accepted them for hys owne, they maye alſo beleue that they are ſaued, bycauſe that he ſhal be no leſſe God to them, then they ſhal be promyſed of hym.
               
                   Therfore hauing had in that couenaunte lyuely faythe,Thys is not ſpoke

For hys goodnes paſſeth their euelnes he wold not haue inſpired thē to gyue them ſelfes, if from without beginning, he had not elected them and takē thē for his own. Some peraduenture wyl ſay, if we were onlye ones ſure to haue ben for a litle time in the fauour of god to haue had his ſpirit in vs, and liuely faith in him, that we did beleue ſurely to be his elect: yet we know not if it haue bene a perfect fayth or not, wee feare it to haue bene a certeyne cold opinion and leaſt we were begyled in beleuing to be in gods fauoure & elected of him. I anſwer that thys is an euidēt ſygne, that ye neuer had hytherto liuely fayth and knowledge of Chriſt. For as it is vnpoſſible to haue fyre within the breſt and not

                  ele it, ſo is it impoſſible to haue in the hart chriſt,
 the holy ghoſt, ardent charity and the fiery light of fayth, and not to perceiue it, & thys is, for that his lighte is ſo clere and effectuous, that not only it maketh them to ſe, and lyuelye to fele with the ſpirite, that Chriſte is deade for them vpon the croſſe, that they are electe and ſaued, but alſo it dothe make them knowe, that it whyche they ſee, is by diuine inſpiracion, that it is the holye ſpirit whiche teſtifieth vnto theyr ſpirite, that thei are the ſonnes of God.Roma. viii. Whoſe teſtimonye is more clere, open, firme, and certein, then al the outward oracles and miracles of the world, which without the inward teſtimonie of the ſpirit, can leaue vs none other thē doutful. Now, yt he that hath in him Chriſt and the ſpirite of God, doth fele, know, and perceiue it: it is clere by Chriſt which ſayde that the world knew not the holy goſt, but that he was knowen of them in whome he was. And by ſaynct Iohn, which ſayd alſo In this we know that Chriſt is in vs,i. Ihon, iii. euen by the holy goſt whiche he hathe geuen vs. Therfore ſayd Paul,ii. Cor. xiii. trie your ſelues, make ſome profe of your ſelues, is it poſſible that ye ſhould not knowe Chriſt in you, if ye be not reprobate? And in an other place▪ know ye not how ye are the temple of God, & that the holy goſt dwelleth in you? The holy ſpirite
 goth ſearching throughout,i. Corin. ii. Eſai. xxxii. Rom. xv. Luke. i. and iudgeth euery thing, & fayth is ſo clere, yt it ſheweth vs the profūditie of god: & thou wilt that it be blynde of it ſelfe. Yea Paul ſayth, that the holy goſt is geuen to vs, to the ende we might know thoſe thinges that haue ben geuen vs of Chriſt.i. Theſſa. i. The kyngdome of God is peace (as wryteth Eſai and Paul) without ſeruile feare, in much certentie. Therefore as Chryſt ſawe, that he was in the fauoure of his father, and his beloued ſonne, ſo alſo do the electe ſe them ſelues, all thoughe not wyth ſo cleare lyghte and certenty, but that they goo ſomtyme doubtynge, ſtumbling, and wauering, Bnt they ought wyth the Apoſtles to pray Chriſt to augmēt their faith And ſeke with their good workes continually to make knowē to thē ſelfs more perfect their ſaluacion and vocaciō, that therby as by the effectes or fruites they ſhuld come in to the ful riches of certein perſwacion, and vnderſtandinge of their election and ſaluation.i. Theſſa. i. ii. Tim. iiii. Rom. viii. Galath. ii,ii. Cori iiii. Paule alſo knew he was in the fauour of God, in faith, hope and charitye, elected the ſonne of God, ſafe and ſure, and that he had the holy goſte and Chriſt wythin hym, when he ſayd that he was one of them that Chriſt was come to ſaue, and that he knew in whome he beleued, that he looked for the
 Crowne, that nothynge could ſeperate hym frō the loue of God, which had elected him before the conſtitution of the world, that he had the ſpirite of adopcion of the ſonnes of God, and that Chriſte was he, who lyued and ſpake in him. Saint Ihō alſo ſaied: we are ſure we know God, and that we liue in him, worldlie and carnall beaſtes are they, which know not God in the holye goſt, nor thoſe thynges which be his,Galath, ii. Ihon. xiiii. i. Cor. ii. euen as mē not regenerate, they are ruſtical payſaūts of ſo abiecte and baſe a ſpirite, that they can not beleue that God hath loued them ſo much, that by the death of his onlye begotten and moſt intierly beloued ſonne, he would ſaue them, take them for his chyldren, and make them hys hepres: But aſtonied of theyr ſinnes, they are euer afrayed of hell. Where the regenerate fele in ſuch ſorte the charitie of God in Chriſt, that they knowe them ſelues to be ſaued, Neyther canne they once thyncke that Chriſte (who hathe all his fathers power and ſhall be theyr iudge) wyll refuſe, loſe, or dampne them, and geue ſentence agaynſt hys brethren and members, for whom he dyed on the croſſe,mat. xxviii and would dye agayne if it were neceſſarie. They haue in them alſo the holye ghoſte for an earneſt of theyr ſaluation.Ephe, i. But if God had geuen
 vs nothyng but our beynge, ſhould not we for that onlye benefite, feele ſo muche the greate goodnes of God, that we myghte be ſure and certayne of our ſaluacyon? And nowe he in euery creature doth ſparkle towardes vs loue, wyth innumerable benefites, yea in Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, caſteth he the flame of perfecte charitye, and ſhall not we feele ſo muche the goodnes of God that we ſhould beleue to be hys electe? If one onlye ſhoulde be ſaued I wolde truſte ſuerly to be he, if all the men & angels wold tel me that I were dampned. I cold not beleue them, although they dyd alledge al the reaſonnes poſſible, but I wolde euer gyue, more truſte to Chriſte alone, who vpon the croſſe, wyth hys bloude and deathe, doeth tel me I am ſaued, thē I wold to al the reſt, for he alone, hath more power in me, thē all the reaſons & authorities without him. Prouided only yt I ſe him wt liuely faythe, dead for my ſaluacion. Yea in that caſe ſeing my ſelfe, by Chriſte, to be the ſonne of God, I wold with Paule excommunicate the very angels as ſuperior to them,Galath. i. if they wold ſai the contrary, or gaineſaie the goſpel, and y• great loue and benefit, which in that caſe I ſhuld fele by Chriſt. Paraduenture yu wilte ſay it ſemeth me not, that I cā be ſure of my
 ſaluacion, becauſe I am fre to do euell, ſo may I ſinne and be damned. Our lyfe is in ſuch ſort variable, y• to giue a certeyne iudgment, we muſt tarye the end, for euerye one wold haue thought, that Iudas ſhuld haue bene ſaued when he was called of Chriſt, & yet it is ſene, that it is contrary. I auſwere, thou begileſt thy ſelfe, in thinking thy ſaluacion dependeth vpon the lykelyhode of thy worckes.Ephe. i. Paule affirmeth, that God hathe 
                     •
                  ected vs by his mere mercy in Chriſte, not becauſe we wer holy, or for that he fore ſaw oure good workes, but becauſe we ſhoulde be holy, and ſhould do good works, & perſeueryng in thē, we ſhould dye in his fauonr and grace: Inwardlye dothe God call hys electe, geueth them knowledge of hym, and doth iuſtifie & glorifie them.Rom. viii. Therfore doth Paul adde and ſay, if god be with vs, who cā be againſt vs? And he ment if we be once electe, we can no more loſe our ſelues: meanyng, there is nothing that can let the eleccion of God. Yea euery thing ſerueth to ſaluacion, euen ſinne. Therfore wher thou ſaieſte, thou mayſt ſinne, it is true, and peraduenture thou ſhalt ſyn. Neuertheles if thou be the electe, thou ſhalt algates ryſe agayne and be ſaued, wherof thou mayſt be certein and ſure, ſo that once at the leaſt thou haue
 perceyued thy ſelfe in Chriſt, and by Chriſt ſaued, neither thou oughteſt ſo much to diſpayre in thy ſelfe, as that thou ſhuldeſt not muchemore truſte in the goodnes of God, knowynge that the Goſpel is not the lawe, but mercye, and knowe thou that when the electe fall in anye ſynne (whyche God doth not permytte but for the benefyte of them, and the other electe) whileſt they are in that erroure, they fele in them ſelues, a certeyne hydden vertue, whyche wyth holdeth and refrayneth them, from doynge worſſe, it biteth, nyppeth, and reprehendeth them of the euel fact, and doth enduce and ſpurre them to conuerte. There remayneth euer a certeyne hate of ſynne, althoughe they be ſome time ouercome of frailtye. So that they are neuer turne from God with al their power nor run wholy to vyce wyth a loſe brydell. God hath them euer for hys owne, and gouerneth them as hys lawefull Chyldren.
               And ſpeaking oftē in their hertes he ſaith y• which he ſaid to his Apoſtles:Luke. xii. feare not litle flocke, for it hathe pleaſed youre father, to giue you his kingdom of his mere goodnes although you be vnworthi. And if thou woldeſt bring in Salomō, who ſayth, none knoweth whether he be worthy of hate or loue, I anſwere. It is clere (chyflie by the words
 whych folow) that he ment, that man were he neuer ſo iuſt & wiſe, was ſo blinde in this world, that he cannot know by the worckes of God, y• is by proſperity or aduerſiti, whether of him ſelf, he be worthy of hate or loue And this is bicauſe God giueth his gifts ſo indifferently, to the good and euell, to theelect and reprobat. Thou wilt ſay yet, Paul ſaid: mi cōſciēce doth not reproue me yet am I not therby iuſtified before God,i. Cor. xiiii. therefore it can not be knowen. But I anſwere, that thentent of Paul was to ſaye, that thoughe by grace of the Lorde he had miniſtred the Goſpell, in ſuche ſorte, that hys conſcyence dyd not rebuke hym of any erroure (which was imputed vnto hym for a ſclaunder of falſe chriſtians) neuertheles he held not him ſelfe iuſte for this, neyther was he iuſte, he iudged him ſelfe iuſte by Chriſt, and not by preaching the Goſpel irreprehenſibly in the ſyght of man, but yet not in the preſence of God, for that he hath not preached it wt the whole force of ſpirit, fayth, and loue. So y• here Paul did condēne the opiniō of them which iudge thē ſelues iuſte by theyr owne workes, but he doth not reproue the iudgement of thoſe, which iudge thē ſelues righteous & ſaued by the bountie of God, & death of his only begotten ſōne: but doth approue
 it. Wyth Paule alſo a greeth Iob, when he ſayde,Iob. ix. that although he were iuſte, he durſte not iudge him ſelfe ſo, that is, he durſte not holde hym for ryghteous, by hys owne proper ryghtuouſenes and worckes, but by the iuſtice of Chriſte.
               Sence then that it maye and oughte to bee knowen of vs, that wee are in the fauoure of God, and hys electe, lette vs force vs continuallye to encreaſe in more knoweledge of the goodnes of God: ſo that firmelye eſtabliſhed in the lyuelye faythe of oure ſaluacyon, we maye as children render him all honoure, laude, and glorye:

               SOme ſaye that it is euell to beleue that we are electe, bycauſe, that as the beleif to be reprobate, bringeth men in diſpeyr ſo y• belief of elecciō, is cauſe of preſumpciō But the iuſt & the holy flye both ye one & the other extremiti. They are not exalted in preſūpcion, beleuing to be elect: nor fallen in ye bottomles pytte of dyſpeyre, wyth beleif of dampnacion, but kepe the meane waye, euer ſtanding betwene both. And I ſay that

                   to preſume, but aſſuredlye to hope and beleue to be ſaued and elected: Mary by oure owne worckes, this is an euyll vyce, and ought to be fled, But to beleue to be elected and ſaued by the liberalitie of God, by the deathe of Chriſte vpon the croſſe, and hys workes: thys is no preſumpciō, but a hope which hath regard (as diuine & theological vertue) not to oure merytes, but onelye to God by Chriſt. And as we cā not loue him ſo much, but y• we euer lacke of y• perfectiō ſo can we not to much hope & truſt in hym. Yea we lacke euer bycauſe we do not promiſe of god ſo much as we ſhould do, he y• beleueth to be ſaued, becōmeth not proud nether magnifieth him ſelfe, nor his workes, but the goodnes of God, & the grace y• we haue by Chriſt. Therfore is it not euel. Per aduēture yu wilt ſaie one ought to ſtande in fere. I agre therto, in the reurēd & ſōnelike feare, y• which importeth obſeruaūce of reuerē

                  e to God, but now not ſo vile: for we ar no more ſeruātes but ſōnes,Rom. viii. not Hebrues but Chriſtians, we are not vnder the lawe but grace, we haue God for oure father, & not onelye for a Lorde. Therfore our office is to loue him like chyldren,Rom. vi. & not to feare him, as ſeruauntes, ſence that we haue the
 ſpirit not of ſeruitude but of adopciō,Rom. viii. of y• ſonnes of God. If our ſaluaciō did depēde in any part vpon our ſelfes: I woulde ſaye we ought to fere our dānaciō yea to be ſure therof: but ſence it is al in y• hādes of God. therfore beholdinge not our ſelues,i. Iohn. iiii but his goodnes diſcouered in Chriſt vpō the cros we may be ſure and certayne of our ſaluaon. Perfect chariti chafeth away al ſeruile feare, & faith neuer douteth if it be perfecte the feare then of our dānacyon groweth of imperfecciō of our charitye, fayth & hope. We ought neuer to frare the mercyfulnes of God, but our owne wyckednes. Thou woldeſt ſaye, if we were wholie cōfirmed in grace, we ſhuld not nede to feare, but we ſynne dayly, therfore it is neceſſary to ſtād in doubte, I aunſwere that yet thou goſt aboute, to builde my hope vpon my workes the whych ſhuld be no hope but a preſumpcion. If we ſhoulde hope wyth condiciō if we do well, and perſeuer therein, my hope ſhuld ſtande wyth deſperaciun, for of my ſelfe I know I ought to deſpaire. If I had the ſynnes of the whole world, yet wold I moſt ſtedfaſtly beleue to be ſaued without any feare of dāpnaciou, neyther maye thys be ſayde to be euell, for that I woulde not builde my hope but vpon Chriſte. If thou
 woldeſt ſay, y• feare of d
                     •
                  mpnaciō cauſeth mē to abſtain frō ſinne, therfore it is good I aunſwer, that it cauſeth men to refrayne in their own loue, as doth the fear of death wherby they become dayly more ſenſual in them ſelues, and therefore trulye, worſe inwardly. Feare worketh wrathe in God, euen as the law doth: and although it cauſe the abſtaine frō ſome euill outward worke uenertheleſſe the venime remaineth within the which is ſo much y• worſe, as it is more vnited to the inward partes, yea that feare geuen to the vngodly, is the ſcorge of God The electe (knowing that God in this preſent life doth punyſhe more the legittimate childrē then the baſtardes) abſtaine alſo by thys feare more thē the other. But truly the loue of God, the quycke feelynge of hys great goodnes, to beleue firmely by Chriſt and his grace to be the ſones of God, elect and ſure in deede, are thoſe thinges whiche mortifie vs to the world and to our ſelues, and maketh ſynne diſpleaſaunt to vs, euen frō the botome of the hert, Therfore wher y• ſeruice feare maketh Ipocrites, y• ſonlyke loue maketh true chriſtiās. If yu woldeſt ſay to beleue, ſo is a thynge verye perilous becauſe y• hereof they take occaſiō to lyue idle yea to geue thē ſelf to alvice, ſaying I wyll
 make my paradiſe in this world, for euery wai I ſhalbe ſaued, ſēce y• alredi I am elect. I anſwer that whē one beleueth to be elect and perceiueth in ſpirit the mercifulnes of God in Chriſte, then God taſted in Chriſt hath in the hert ſuch efficacie and ſtrength, that he cannot offende, but is forced to dyſpraiſe the world, & is rapt to ſo hygh eſtate that he falleth to obliuion of the world him ſelfe and his paradiſe, ſetting only God be fore his eies.Ihon, iii. Therfore ſayth ſaynte Iohn. Who ſo hath thys fayth, ſanctyfyeth hym ſelf. So as thē of chariti ſpringeth but goodnes▪ euen ſo is it, of thys faith & hope. Knoweſt thou wherin is the paril? In beleuing to be elected, by their workes, and by beleuynge in Chriſte not ſted faſtly, but to haue only a certaine barraine, idle and a dead opinion therof, the which ſtādeth in y• worſt life, in ſuche ſorte that of that colde and vnfruteful fayth, they maye take occaſyon to geue thē to Idelnes, and al vice. But nowe not of that perfect fayth, the whych is effectuous in doing worckes by loue, being an enflamed lyght,Galath, v. the whiche is neuer wythoute burning. If alſo thou wouldeſt ſay in beleuinge to be elect thou ſhouldeſt peraduenture be begyled, therefore it is euell. I wold yet anſwer, that I would ſoner geue
 faithe to the holy goſt, whiche teſtifieth in ye hartes of the electe, that thei are the ſonnes of God (as Paule wryteth) then to the that woldeſt put me in doubt of it.Rom, viii. The electe to heare inwardlye in their hertes a ſpirituall voyce, quycke and deuyne, whiche biddeth theym not doubte, and that they are ſure of theire ſaluacion, & that God loueth them, and hathe taken them for his chyldren,Ihon. i. and that they cannot periſhe: the teſtymonye of God is greater then mans.
               Therfore not onlie he is to be beleued afore man, but he deſeruethe to haue giuen vnto him vndoubted credite, If thou woldeſt ſai it might be, not the ſpirite of God but their imagynacyons. I ſaye, that what ſo euer it is they knowe better then thou, for that (as Paule ſaythe) none knoweth what is in mā but the ſpyryte of man,i. Cor. ii. that is wythin hym Farder I am ſure, that the ſame ſpyryt whiche ſaith to me, I am elected is the ſpyrit of God becauſe the faythe I haue of the eleccion, ſpryngeth not of my worckes, but onlye of the goodnes of god, vnderſtād in Chriſte and for that of hys goodnes can growe nether gyle nor falſhod, therfore am I ſure to be in the trueth. Deceites & falſhedes, mai, & do come, of the belefe to be ſaued, by workes, and elected: Moreouer the lyght whyche
 the electe haue of theyr ſaluacyon, is ſo cleare, that they do not onlye ſe them ſelues ſure thereof, but they knowe alſo, that the lyghte and knowledge they haue, is ſupernaturall & deuyne. But we ſuppoſe as thou ſayſt, that in beleuynge to be electe only by Chriſte and the goodnes of God, I myghte be begiled (whiche is falſe and impoſſyble) yet wolde I ſtyll ſay, let me be deceyued for it is good to be ſo begyled, ſence I can fynd nothyng, that ſo much doth kyndel me into a ſyncere and pure loue of god, as to beleue to be elected bi his mere goodnes. Therfore vſinge it to make me inamored of God, I ought not to be wythdrawen, chifely for y• I am happy, only by that fayth, of ye whyche whoſoeuer is voide, is not yet entred in to the kyngdom of God, wher is nothynge but ryghtuouſnes peace and Ioie.Rom. iiii.
               
               Finally Paul beleued to be elected as in many places he ſaythe, yea he gloryed therin (neuertheleſſe in God) and ſo to beleue he induced others, the whiche, if it had bene euel, he wolde not haue done. Therefore if it be not euel, let vs alſo with Paule, glorivs by God in Chriſte,Luke. x. Math. xv. Math. xvi. who lykewyſe induced the Apoſtles, to beleue y• theyr names were writē in heauen, that theyr heauēly reward was plētuous, & that they ſhulde iudge the

Thou wilt ſaie, thou oughteſt not to compare thy ſelfe, equall wyth the ſainctes. I ſaie it is true that I oughte not to preſume to be like them, or holy by myne owne worckes, for while I preſume of my ſelf, I muſte of force become a deuell, but it is not euell to compare with the ſaintes in veritie for they were humble, and in beleuing that they were elect, they gaue to God all laude and glorye becauſe they did not beleue to be of the electe for their merites, but for Chriſtes. And wold to God, I mighte beleue y• firmelye and with ſtedfaſt fayth, the ſacred ſcriptures are ful, that we ought not to deſpeire of our ſaluacion, but that we ought to hope and beleue to be all readye ſaued, and dayly to certifie our ſelues therof bi doinge good worckes,ii. Peter, i. i. Ihon. iiii. which are a teſtimonie to vs of oure election, and that we ſhulde alſo increaſe in charitye, to take from vs all feare of oure dampnaciō to the end we may ſerue God without feare, in rightuouſnes and holineſſe as Zacharie ſayde. And likewiſe we ought to demaūd perſeueraūce in the good
 wt faith to obtein it,Luke. i. Therfore to truſt to be ſaued, & of the elected & to hope & beleue to
 be ſaued & of the elect, is not euel. Paul al ſo ſaith: oure hope was neuer confounded nor dyd ſhame to them that had it.
               And lykewyſe that fayth, was neuer begiled. Wherfore then is it euyll that I bleue ſtedfaſtly to be ſaued by Chriſt? Let vs beholde then with open eyes of liuely fayeth, Chriſt vpon the croſſe, in whome we ſe preſentelye the goodnes of God in the face in ſuch ſort, as we may beynge pylgrimes, to the ende we may render to him al laud, honour and glory through Ieſus Chriſt oure Lorde. AMEN.
            
            
               ¶The .xvi. Sermon
               Whether it be neceſſary to ſaluacion to beleue that we are elected or not,
               FAyth is very neceſſarye,Heb. xi. Mar. xvi. Ihon, iii. becauſe that wythout it, not onlye God can not be pleaſed, but he that beleueth not ſhalbe condempned, and is already iudged, But it is alſo impoſſible, that one that doth not beleue to be elected ſhoulde beleue as he ought to do any of the artycles neceſſarye to ſaluacion. And to proue that this is true, if thou beleueſt not that thou art on

 not to haue a certeine dead opiuiō that God is, but thou muſt effectuouſlye beleue that he is thy God, yt he loueth the, that he is propiciatory to the, yt he is cōtinually beneficial to y•, that he hath moſt ſpecial cure of the & cauſeth euery thinge to ſerue the to ſaluacion, & therfore that yu arte electe. Yea who ſo beleueth not that he is electe, doeth not fele in ſpirite, the benefyte of Chriſte. Therfore being without Chriſt,Epheſi. i. Galat. iiii. he is with oute God, and knoweth him not as Paule wryteth. Then how is it poſſible that thou mayſt beleue perfectli that he is thy father if thou do not beleue that thou art his ſōne, and therfore his heire & ſaued.Gala. iiii. Thou canſt alſo neuer earneſtly beleue that God is omnipotente, if thou vnderſtande not, that cō
                  tinually he vſeth his omnipotēcy towards the, in doynge the good. Whyche when wt  the ſpirite thou didſt proue, thou ſhouldeſt of force beleue thy ſelfe to be hys heyre, if thou beleue not thou art electe, how canſte thou beleue that God hathe created the heauens, and the earth, & that he ſuſteineth & gouerneth all to thy behofe hauing of the moſt ſingluler cure? it is nedeful, that with liuely fayth, embraſing al the world for thy owne, thou perceiue effectuallye the goodnes of God, in euerye creature. And when
 that is, thou ſhalte be inforced to beleue, y• thou arte the ſonne of God. Thou canſte not alſo beleue in Ieſu, that is that he is to the Ieſus and ſauioure, if thou beleue not that thou art ſaued, neyther canſte tho

The which if thou dydſt beleue thou ſhuldeſt alſo beleue to be elected. Howe ſhalt yu beleue yt Ieſus is the only bego

It is neceſſarye to beleue, that Chriſt vpon the cros hath ſatyſfyed for thy ſynnes, and that he hath reconciled the, ſatyſfyed to his father and ſaued the, & therefore that yu art the ſon of God: he that beleueth (as he ought) y• Chriſt is ryſē to inſtify vs, doth alſo know him ſelf ſaued, & ſo he y• perfectly doth vnderſtand that Chryſt our

Neither is it inough that there is a church of God,Rom. viii. but thou muſt beleue to be a porcion thereof, & one of the lyuely ſtones, & therfore one of the electe. And to beleue the cōmuniō of ſayntes, thou muſt feele, that as a mēber of Chriſt, he doth perticipate his grace wt the, and y• thou art therby ſaued, yu muſt alſo be leue ye remiſſion of ſyns, y• is not ouly that he dothe pardon ſynnes, but that he hathe pardoned the thine, and ſo elected the. Euē ſo thou muſt beleue, that thou ſhalt ryſe glorious, and haue life euerlaſting, Thē there
 is no article of oure fayth, y• can be beleued in ſuche ſorte as it ought to be, of thoſe whiche doo not beleue they are elected. To the Chriſtian it is then neceſſary to beleue that God is hys God, and father: that he worketh all for his benefite▪ and that Chriſte is come, was borne, hath liued, dyed and riſen agayne for his ſaluacion, ſo that wt lyuelye faith he ēbraceth Chriſt wholi for his owne with al his treaſure & grace.

Otherwiſe they ſhall neuer truſte in God, but wyth Adam ſhal feare hym, and flye, ſeking to hide hym ſelfe from the face of God, nether is it poſſyble to loue God in veryty, honor hym as he ought to be honored and approue for iuſt and holy all his workes, and ſo delite wholye in hym, if he fele not in Chriſt ſo muche the goodnes of God, that he ſe hym ſelfe hys ſonne & alſo heire.Galat▪ iiii.

But let vs praye to God to open oure eyes, to the ende they maye no longer blaſpheme, but render to God all honoure, lande, and glorye, by Ieſu Chriſte oure Lorde. Amen.
            
            
               The .xvii. Sermon..
               If it be good to ſeeke to know wherefore God hathe ſome electe and ſome reprobate.
               THy deſyre maye be wycked, as it is in manye, to whome it appeareth that it ſhould haue bene better, if God (who beinge of power as he is) had elected al mē
                  ▪ and ſemeth theym, that in thys God hathe
 lacked of charitye, yea in theyr language, they ſaye in theyr heart ſecretely. If we had bene God, we woulde haue elected all, and would haue had more charitie thē he. Now behold, whether this be vngodlye, folyſhe, proude plaſphemy, or not. They Imagyne to haue more loue to the ſouls, then he, that for to ſaue theym gaue hys onlye begotten and dearlye beloued ſonne vpon the croſſe,i. Ihon. iiii. There are ſome other, to whome it ſemeth on the one ſyde, that God can not erre: and on the other parti, hearinge that he hath reproued many, they thinke the cōtrary. Thei are not certeine by fayth, that God can not erre, and that al that he willeth, muſt nedes be iuſte. Therfore to make it cleare, they go ſearchyng, wherfore he hath not elected all men, and they would fynd a cauſe where is none. If ſuch were godly, they ſhuld quiete and ſatiſfie thē ſelues, & ſhuld haue their felicitie in the deuine pleſure, wtout ſearching to aſſēd anyhier. It is euyl thē to ſeke wherfore god hath elected ſome, & other ſome not if this grow of the ſuſpicion that God may or haue erred. The godly knoweth certeinli by faith yt he cānot erre, & hereupō reſteth. There are ſome that aſke after it of arrogē
                  cie and preſumpcion. They woulde be anſwered, that god had elected them for theyr
 good workes, to haue wherein they myght glory of them ſelues. And whē they hear ſai that God hath elected them by grace, it diſpleaſeth them, they gainſa
                     •
                  e it, ſeming them there reſteth nothinge to glory in. And they perceyue not that this is the whole glory of the humble and true chriſtiane, to be ſaued by the mere grace of God, and Chriſt crucified, and to glorye onlye in God by Chriſte and in them ſelues not to ſee, but thynges worthy to be a ſhamed of, to thend y• to god only be honour and glory. It groweth alſo to many of vnreuerence,i. Tim. iiii. for if they coulde ſe howe inacceſſible the maieſtie of God is howe irreprehenſible is hys wyll, and how incōprehēſible is his wiſedome, they wolde not ſet them ſelues to diſpute wyth god, ſpecially if they knewe howe blynd, darke, frā
                  ticke and foliſhe they be.Roma. ix. And who art thou ſayd Paul, that wilt diſpute with God, anſwer and contend with God? Paul was returned from the thyrd heauen, where he had heard ſecrets, ſo hygh that it was not lawfull to ſpeake to man. Neuertheles doynge reuerence to the diuine ſecret iudgementes he ſayd: O profoūd riches of the wiſdome and ſcience of God, how incōprehēſible are his iudgementes? And man, blynd, folyſhe and vngodly, is ſo high minded, that he wil
 do wronge to God, condēpning him, and reproue his holy, iuſt, & irreprehenſible iudgementes. And how many are thei that ſeke to knowe, ſpeake & wryte of it, aud he commē
                  ded therfore? And al that they can Imagine by force of their owne wytte, and natural knowledge (which can not perce ſo high ſecretes) they put in wryting. And they are as arrogant, as if they wer in goodnes and ſapi

                  nce ſuperior to God: to be adored of the worlde, they condemne the workes of god. Ther are mani which ar not cōtēt to know aſmuch as God hath vouchſaued to opē to vs, but they wold know alſo a greate deale more, But it is not the offyce of a good ſer

Yea Chriſt him ſelf ſaid that he had made knowne,Ihon. xv. all that he hadde
 heard of the father, oure office is to ſeke, to taſte and fele with the ſpirite, that which he hath opened to vs, and we maye alſo deſyre to know all that pleaſeth God to reuele vs, forthe benefite of oure ſoule, and his glory nowe for that God (to beate downe carnall man, to the ende that to him, be geuen al honoure, laude and glorye) hath vouche ſafed to open in the holy ſcriptures, wherefore he hath elected ſome, & other ſome he hathe not Therfore we mai & ought to ſeke to know it that we may ſo much ye more honour god: but we oughte to beleue it to be ſo, as God hath declared, & to cōtent vs with that way God hath taken, in electing & reprobating, neither to thinke nor ſuſpect, that god hathe erred, nor ought to deſpre anye other waye, but to be ſatiſfied and pleaſed, with ſomuch as pleaſeth the lord, without being curious in wyllyng to know more then that whych pleafeth God to reuele vnto vs, & al that to the end by Ieſus Chriſt we may render him al honor, lande and glory.

               ¶Th .xviii. Sermon.
               ☞ Of the diuerſe effectes that it worketh in mā to beleue that our eleccion is al in the hands of god and that of him only it depēdeth.
               
                   IT is ſeene by expeience, that of one ſelfe cauſe, doth grow ſometymes contrary effectes. And is euydent by the ſun, whych hardneth myre, and melteth waxe: and this is by theyr dyuerſe diſpoſicions. Euen ſo of the belief that our eleccion is wholye in the handes of God, dothe ſpringe in men contrary effectes, by theyr contrary diſpoſicyons. The vngodlye perceyuyng that in the deuyne mynde is reſolued theyr beynge, to be ſaued or dampned, they are wroth wyth God, they blaſpheme hym wyth their heart they call hym parcyall and vniuſte, they gyue them ſelues to do euell ynoughe, ſayinge euerye waye: that ſhall be which God hathe infallyblye foreſene, and immutably determyned, yea their faltes they caſt in the face of God, thynkynge that he is the cauſe therof, many alſo deſpaire of their ſaluacyon & preſume more of them ſelues, then they hope in God, they beleue that they ſhuld be ſaued, if theyr ſaluacion dyd depende vpon them ſelues, and therefore if they could diſturbe the deuyne counſayles, and make that theyr ſaluacyon ſhoulde not be in the handes of God, they woulde do it. And thys is for that they knowe not theyr owne greate myſerye howe blynde, infirme, frail and vnprofytable, they are to God impotent
 of them ſelues to goodnes, & full of all wickednes, and that they dyd neuer worke (if it were put in ye balēce of deuine iuſtice) that merited not to be puniſhed, and ſo lyke wiſe they fele not y• great goodnes of God, nor the benefits of Chriſt but thinke him to be Irefull, reuengable, diſdaineful, proude, parpetual, vniuſt and malignaunt, as them ſelfes are, There are ſome whiche haue not perfecte fayth, but they are not ſo vngodly as the fyrſt. Now theſe when they here ſay, or thincke yt their ſaluacion is all in the handes of God, they remayne confuſed and euell contented. And this is alſo for want for knowledg of the goodnes of god, they truſt partly in God, & partly in them ſelues, they loue not God, nor truſt nor hope perfectlye in him they remain doubtful, and know not whether it be beſt to depend al vpon god or not, and it ſemeth them that it ſhoulde haue bene beſte that in ſome part it ſhuld depend vpon them ſelues: and yet they thyncke it wel being al in the hands of God, troubled in ſuch ſort, that they canne not tel which to chuſe: Therfore they liue in a great perplexiti. They conſult ſometimes wt the holy ſcripture or wt thē yt haue yt knowledge of y• truth & they find that it is al in the hands of God, 
                     •
                   they iudge (when their eies are ſomewhat
 opened to the goodnes of god & theyr owne miſeries) that it ſtādeth wel, and that ſo it is beſte, but then harkenynge to humane prudence, the whyche not being wholye mortyfyed, wolde haue parte of the glorye to it ſelfe (ſo proude it is.) And as that, that is blynd, and ſeeth not the impotencie and malignitie of man, it perſwadeth hym yt ma
                     •
                   might in ſome parte be ſaued by hym ſelfe, wher els he mai deſpair, if it ſtād al in yt hād of God. Therfore it cōcludeth, that it were better if it dyd depend vpon vs, and chiefly for that men become negligēt, in thynkyng that it depēdeth whol
                     •
                   vpō God, wher thei wold ſtyrre them ſelues to be feruēt, if they dyd beleue that in any part it reſted in thē. And although ſuch finde the contrary in the ſacred ſcriptures, neuertheles they forcethē wyth ye obſcure lyghte of theyr blynde prudēce, to draw it out of the texte, expounding it as may beſt ſerue to theyr purpoſe. But y• godly perceyue on the one ſyde, in ſuch ſort theyr own proper ignoraūcy, fraylty, impotency. & malice: And on the other partye the great boūty of god in Chriſt crucyfyed, yt it contenteth them to be ſo, al in the hand of God, not only for yt it hath ſo pleaſed god, but alſo for theyr own commoditie, becauſe that wheras if in the leaſte iote it depended
 vpon them, they ſhould hold thē ſelues dā
                  ned. Now they fele ſo much the excellencie of god, that certified of their ſaluacion, thei know thē ſelues elected, & hold it to be ſure ſeyng by fayth that it is al in the hād of one their ſo mighty, ſapyēt, excellēt & loving father. Wherfore by this benefite, thei ar ſtirred to loue hym ſingularly, to thāke, laude, and ſerue hym as childrē for his mere glori without reſpecte at all to them ſelues, their hel or heauen. And if god wold ſet in theyr handes, although he woulde be bound that they ſhould be able to do al thinges wt eaſe toward theyr ſaluaciō, yet they wolde not accept the bargayne: & that is becauſe they knowe that they are contrary enemies and traitours to them ſelues: ſo that if they had para
                     •
                  yſe in theyr handes, then they ſhould let it fal to the ground. And alſo for yt, they do make experiment and proue ſo gret charyty of god in Chriſt, that it certifieth them of their eleccyon. They cannot thynke that Chriſt beyng theyr iudge, and dying vpon the croſſe for them, ſhould geue ſentence againſt them: yea they know, that who ſo be leueth in hym ſhall not be iudged,Ihon. iii. but ſhal be ſo certayne of his ſaluacion, that he ſhal not nede to mak
                     •
                   diſſcuſſion of his lyfe, for there ſhal not be any to accuſe hym, nether
 ſhould it be cōueniēt that thoſe which haue the ſpirite of God, and are hys ſonnes, the brethren and members of Chriſt,Rom. viii. ſhould be examined & iudged. But with Chriſte they ſhalbe iudges of the other. Therfore the elect, ſure of theyr ſaluaciō, wolde not chāge Chriſt theyr udge wyth any in this world,Math. xix. although it were theyr deare frynd or 
                     •
                  ere parent. Yea if God did put in their arbitrement to haue Chriſte for theyr iudge or els to be their owne iudges of thē ſelues, with full power to geue ſentence in their fauour althoughe it were not iuſte, yet to be approued, they wold for all thys, chuſe Chriſte to be theyr iudge, for that they truſte more in him then in them ſelues. Alſo thei loue god ſo much, that they wold not glory, but only in him by Chriſte, And this is al there true glorye. Yea if they could let or diſturbe the deuine counſayle, or if it were neceſſary to be dampned they would chuſe, rather to be in payne for the wyll of God, then in al the pleaſures, diſagreinge to the deuine wil (if it were poſſible) they count them ſelues vnworthy to ſuffer for the wyl of God.

               ¶The .xix. Sermon
               Howe it ought to be anſwerd to thē that lament that God hath created them forſeyng theyr damnacyon.
               THere are many the whych althoughe of God they haue had their beynge, & many other benefytes, neuertheleſſe they thanke hym not, but are vngratefull. They are ſorye, and lamente of all the wealth they haue had of hym, ſaying: Lord if the beyng wher thou haſt geuen vs, with the reſt of thi gyftes, dyd ſerue vs to ſaluacicō, we ſhuld thāk ye therfore, But bicauſe they ſerue vs not, but to dāpnaciō, therfore
 we cānot but cōplaine vs of the. Nowe to theſe oughte to be of anſwered thus: Eyther you beleue to be yt elect or not. If thei ſai yea: it ought to be ſaid to thē, ye ſhuld thāk God of ſo much grace, that he hath ſhewed to you alreadye, in choſynge you frō ſo baſe a being, to ſo high an eſtate, & you lamēt your ſelfes: behold if your ingratitude be great. And if thei wold ſai we are not ſory for our ſelues, for we beleue to be elect, but for cōpaſſiō on thoſe pore ons y• reprobate. Then I would to be ſayd, it is no true pity to haue compaſſiō vpō them, yt are vu godlye, agaynſt the deuine goodnes ſhewed chiefly in Chriſte crucyfyed. Think you happelye, to haue more charitye thē God? take heede that youre demaunde, wherfore God hoth creat the reprobate, grow not of the doubte, that God can do them ani iniuſtyce. Do ye feare yt God, being very rightuouſnes,Ephe. i. yea charitie it ſelfe, cā do thē any wrong? But if you lyuely & verilie dyd beleue to be electe by Chriſt, by mere grace & mercye of God, ye ſhuld feele in ſuch ſorte the deuine goodnes, that ther could not enter into youre minde ſo vngodly conceyts. They are in good cuſtodie, being in the hā
                  des of God. They are in the power of one whych neuer did, nor may do one of ye leaſt
 cruelties, yea he neuer doth iuſtice, but it is wyth great mercie. Will ye know more of the deuine ſecretes then Paul? which rapt to the thirde heauen,i. Corin. i. heard thyngs ſo highe and ſo ſecrete, that to man it is not lawfull to be ſpokē of? ioCor. i. It ſuffiſed him only to know Chriſt crucified. Is it not thinke ye inough to you to know Chriſt crucified, in whom are hydden all the treſures of the wiſdome and ſcience of God? And if that ſuffyce you in Chriſt is ſene none but the electe, the reprobate are wythoute Chriſte, & in Chriſte only ought we to contemplate and behold our eleccion, your offyce ſhuld be to attend to your ſelues, to encreſe dayly by Chriſte in greater knowledge of the bounty of god and to make certayne to ye worlde wt good workes,i. Tim. iiii. youre vocacion and eleccion, and not to be ſo curyous of other, forgettynge your ſelues. And if they woulde ſaye, we dout & fere alſo leaſt we he reprobat,ii. Peter. i. & therfore we complain vs, and wold know why he hath created vs, forſeyug our dampnaciou: nowe theſe muſt be exhorted not to deſpaire, but to contemplate & loke in Chriſt in whom they ſhall ſe them ſelues elected. And ſo they ſhal not haue wherof to take occaſion to lament, after it muſt be ſaid to thē for as much as ye do not beleue verely yet
 to be of the electe, it is a ſygne that ye haue not lyuely lyghte of Chriſt, nor of his great benefite, & not knowyng Chriſt, it behoueth to ſaye wyth Paule that ye know not God iu veryty,Galat. iiii. and that ye are wythout him. And how is it poſſyble then that you being with out God and wythout the true knowledge of hym,Ephe, ii, ſhould vnderſtand and knowe hys high ſecretes? It is not poſſible to know ſoner the deuine iudgements then God. Ye be therfore wythout fayth, and I proue that it is true, becauſe that if ye had faith, ye ſhuld ſe ſo clerely that God doth euery thyng wel and can not erre, that you wold aſke none other reaſon. And for that who ſo is wythout fayth, is frantycke concernynge the deuyne thynges, it muſt nedes be ſayd that you are euen ſo, and now is it a frauſy▪ your demaū
                  dyng a reaſon of the creacyon of the reprobate, neyther ſhould it be poſſyble to ſatiſfy you, tyl ſuch tyme your reaſon were healed by fayth. Yea whyle that ye are ſo wythout lyght ſupernaturall, beyng thereof not able to conceyue, he that ſhuld ſerch to quiet you with reaſones, ſhuld alſo enter into a franſy with you. Humble then your ſelues to God and aſke him faith and not reaſous, becauſe that thynges ſupernaturall, can not be ſene but by fayth. Inſatiable is the gyft of foliſh
 and franticke curioſitie, the godly odo
                     •
                  e, the hygh & iucōprehenſible iudgemētes of God and wyth humility, they are content to taſt in them by faythe, ſome drop of the deuyne ſapience & goodnes: wher the vngodly preſumyng wythout fayth, haue a wil to perce to the iuacceſſible counſayl of God, and remaynyng in darckenes become madde and foliſh: ye perceyue not that ye want the true conceiuyng of God. If ye thynke that God may erre or do anythyng vniuſtly: you wil perhappes adde lyght to that perfect lyght rule the diuyne ſapyence, correct that infyuite goodnes, iudge that iudgeles iuſtyce, and condempne that ſupreme mercye and charitye. If thou dyddeſt ſee the hyghnes and magnificence of God, and on the other ſyde, the baſenes and vanity of man, & how in all thynges he dependeth vpon hym, ye ſhuld ſe that he neuer puniſhed them in ſuch ſorte yt they deſerued not to haue a greater punyſhmēt, beyng ſo frātycke & proude, ye are not capeable nor worthy to haue lyghte of the hygh iudgemēt of God, yea you deſerue to remaine ſo confuſed. And for that it is the iuſt iudgemēt of God, that for the earneſt pain of your hell, ye ſhuld go euer with your troubleſome thoughtes, cōpaſſyng by ſuch darke & in extricable maſes. Therefore
 although I could geue you a reaſō of al the workes of God. I wold not do it. Humble you thē to God, & aſke him faith, for with y• only ladder, we aſcēd to ye intelligēce of the ſecretes of God. And thē whē ye ſhal haue faith, ſeinge wyth cleare and ſupernaturall lyght, that god doth al thynges wel, ye ſhal no more care for a further reaſon. And if alſo thou ſhuldeſt ſeke it, it ſhulde be wyth a godlye mynde to be ſo muche the more able the better to beholde God, in hys iuſte and holye iudgementes. And then I wolde ſaye to you, that God myght haue ſaued al, but he hath not wylled it, yea foreſing the damnacyon of the vngodlye▪ he created theym, not for to ſaue them,Rom. vi. or to the end thep ſhuld be ſaued, but to ſerue hym ſelfe of theym, ſo much the more to be ſhewed bright and gloryous,Pro. xix. to the worlde. The whych is a more beutyfull, more ryche, more happy, & more wonderfull ordynaunce, then if ſynne had neuer ben in the world. And this is becauſe Chriſte and hys electe (of ſynne) haue taken occaſyon, to honoure God more then if the world had neuer ben innocēt, and god with greateſt ſapience, dyd reduce all the dyſorders, into a more meruelous order, then if the world had neuer heue diſordred by ſinne If ſinne had not bene, the ſaintes had neuer
 bene perſecuted, impriſoned, and ſlayne, no more Chriſte crucified. Where then ſhulde haue bene theyr vyctorye, theyr Palme, triumphes and crownes? And if the reprobate wold ſay: we are forced to confeſſe yt God hathe done well to permit the ſynnes of the electe, that after as the prodygall ſonne, of his errour & miſeries, toke occaſion to open his eies & know him ſelf, yea, & to returne to his father, to humble him ſelf to repēt with hart, & axe him pardō and therby to taſt the fatherly charitie, when he pardoned him, in more perfecte maner, then he had done before: ſo the electe, of theire ſinnes take occaſion the better to know themſelues, and the bountie of God, and it is no ſmall benefyte of God, that he ſuffer him ſelfe to be wounded of his children, and beare wyth it, to the eude that ſome day, opening their eies, they maye ſe their great ingratitude, and the exceſſiue loue that he beareth them. God alſo of theſe, may be afterwarde ſurelye ſerued, at euerye noble and greate enterpryſe, as of them that are altogether his, not only for y• he hath created and preſeruedthē, but much more becauſe that by ſinne being loſt, with the bloud of his only begottē ſonne, he hath recouered them. And ſo was Chriſte ſerued of Paul, & of his other mighti chāpions, we
 muſte of force confeſſe alſo, that God doth well to permitte the ſynnes of the reprobat to exerciſe the elect in vertues, for the greater tryumphe of Chryſte and his glori. But it ſemeth that it ſhoulde haue bene better, y• after that God had ſerued his tourne wyth them, he ſhoulde touche theyr hearte, and geue them his knowledge, and his grace, ſo that they alſo of theyr ſynnes ſhoulde take occaſion, to reknowledge theyr vyce, and the goodues of God, ſo that they might be ſaued, to them ye ought to ſay: ſen
                     •
                  e ye confeſſe, that God hath done well, to permitte the ſynnes of the reprobate, ye can not deny but that for thē thei deſerue to be dampned. Ye are alſo forced to ſai, that god dampneth them iuſth, fence that thei haue ſinned: God then doth wel to permitte them to ſinne, and when they haue ſinned, he may iuſtli damn thē becauſe that voluntarilie thei did ſinne, and the fa
                     •
                  te was theires and not Goddes. Ye can not then complayne you of God, if he dampne you, but are conſtrained to ſaye he doeth wel, And if they ſaye it is true, but yet it ſhulde ſeme vs to be better, and wyth h
                     •
                  s greater glory, if after he were ferued of thē, he wold ſaue them. To theſe I anſwer fyrſt that is beſte, whiche pleaſeth God, & becauſe it pleaſeth him to dampne thē, therfore
 that is beſte. Then if God in the end of the life, ſhuld geue light to al. And ſo at laſt euery one ſhuld conuerte, they wold do many more enormious ſinnes thē they do. For the vngodlye wolde ſay, we may do euerye euell, let vs take oure pleaſure and lyue frely, wythout any feare, for euery way in the end we ſhalbe ſaued. And for that one only ſinne is worſe thē al the peines of the dampned, therfore it is beſte, that they be dampned. Theire dampnacion ſerueth alſo to the electe, in as much as that ſernauute whiche when he ſeeth iuſtice done to his felowe ſeruaunte that before woulde haue ſtrangled hym, knoweth the goodues of hys Lorde, and the malignity of the man: ſo the electe by ſeinge in the damyned the iuſtyce of god do come to more knowledge of hys mercye and iuſtice, and alſo of theyr owne miſerye. God is ſerued then of the reprobate, to illuſtrate and ſet forth hys glory, and vſeth thē for inſtrumentes, not onlye whyle they are in thys lyfe, but in death and in hel. His glory alſo is more dyſcouered (as Paule wryteth) by hauynge in hys great houſe veſſels of golde, of ſyluer, of wodde, and earthe, of mercy, & of wrath. But let vs thanke God that he hathe elected vs, and pray hym that he geue vs ſo muche lyght of his goodnes,
 and ſo muche feruencye, that althoughe he wold neuer be angry wyth vs, not only we ſhould be content, but that we holde it fora ſynguler pryueledge, that he wyl vouchſafe in ſuch maner to ſerue him ſelf of vs, to the ende that in euery ſtate, & for euer, we maye render him all laude, honoure and glorye, by Ieſu Chriſte oure Lord. Amen.
            
            
               The .xx. Sermon.
               Wherefore God hathe elected vs:
               IT ſhuld be no leſſe then a very folyſhnes when one entendynge to ſpeake of couloures, ſhoulde brynge in the opynion of one that is borne blynde, and not illumpnate by myracle. So is it madneſſe in the thynge ſupernaturall, to alledge the iudgement of them that are not inſpired but with naturall vnderſtandynge. And by aduenture haue talked, of hygh, hydde and deuine ſecretes, euen as it hath ſemed well, in their owne blynde and darcke vnderſtandynge, hauinge therby their eies euer open, to magnifie man. Now bicauſe that of the ſupernatural matters, ther is ſo much knowē as is reueled and opened to vs. Therfore loking in the holy ſcriptures,Ephe, i. I find that god hath elected vs by Chriſte, that is, that God lokinge
 in the progeny of Adam, ſaw nothing there that was worthy of oure election: but tourninge the regarde to his own goodnes and Chriſtes,Math. iii. in whom he was ſo wel pleaſed, that by him he did electe vs,Ephe. i. he therfore choſe vs not becauſe we were holy, but becauſe we ſhulde be, ſo that the deuine grace founde no ſaintes but made ſaintes. Therfore did Paule geue thanches to God, that had made vs mete to the enherptaunce of ſayntes. He choſe vs then becauſe it pleaſed him ſo, for he loued vs frelie without ſeinge in vs anythynge worthy therof. He elected vs (as writeth Paule) after the decreed purpoſe of his owne will,Epheſi. i. to the laud and glory of hys fre mercye and not for our worckes. So that not bicauſe we were iuſte and worthy in hys ſyght, he did elect and cal vs, but (as Paule ſaieth) bicauſe he hathe elected,Rom. viii. therefore he doeth cal, iuſtifye and glorifpe vs. In ſuch ſorte▪ that he willed not the end for the begynnyng ſake, but the begynnyng for ye end ſake. He hath ſaued vs after Paul not by the worckes that we haue done, but by his mercy. In another place he ſaieth, y• he hath deliuered and called vs with his holye vocation not after our worckes but accordynge to hys purpoſed mercie, giuen alreadie to vs before the creaciō of the world:i
                        •
                     . Tim. i.
                   ſo then, as of the ſecretes reueled to the litel ones and hidden from the wiſe and prudent Chriſte did giue none other cauſe, but for y• ſo it pleaſed the father,Math. xi. ſo of our electiō ther may no nother cauſe be alleged, but only becauſe it is the pleaſure of God. Paule wylleth that the purpoſe that God hathe made vs, maye not depende vpon our workes, becauſe it ſhulde not be firme as it is, nor we ſure, as Chriſt ſayth we are, and Paul alſo. If thou woldeſt ſai, that Paul to the Rom. ſpake of the eleccion of Iacob & Eſau,Rom. ix. concerning the fyrſt byrth,Iohn. x. & not cōcerninge the heauenly inheritaūce.Rom. viii. I wold anſwer that Paule with that trope,Rom. ix. doth declare the maner of the eternal eleccion to paradiſe, other wyſe the elecciō of Iacob, ſhuld be in vain, in the which is ſene (touching the things of the preſent life) nothing but calamiti & trouble. But the principall intent of Paul is to proue that although the carnal Hebrues be not ſaued, it reſteth not therfore, that Ieſus is not the Meſſias, for yt the promiſes were made to the ſpiritual Hebrues, the which in faith do imitate & folow Abrahā, & they ar y• elect.Mala. i. When God alſo in Mala. ſheweth to the Iues that he hath loued thē, becauſe he loued Iacob of whom they deſcended, and hated Eſau: His reaſon had bene vnuailable
 if God dyd loue and choſe by workes. For the Iewes might haue anſwered: if thou dideſt loue Iacob and the Hebrues, it was becauſe thou dydeſt foreſe theyr good works: and in lyke caſe thou woldeſt haue done to Eſau and the Gentils,Rom. ix. if thou haddeſt foreſene and good workes in them. But Paule ſheweth that the Meſſias is come alſo to ye gētils, becauſe God geueth hys gyfts with out hauinge reſpect to workes. If thou demaund wherfore he hath elected thē. Paul anſwereth, becauſe it is written: I wil ſhew mercye on whom it pleaſeth me.Rom. ix. Therfore Paule doth in ferre and bring in, that paradyſe is not hys that wil, nor that runnethor laboreth by hym ſelfe to get it, but his that God wyl ſhew mercy vnto. He myght alſo haue anſwered, that althoughe God hated Eſau before he was borne, & before he dyd ſinne, he is not therefore wicked, for he had hym not in hate or he did foreſe his wickednes. But he ſaith that he doth indurate whō he wyl, to ſet forth the brightnes of his glorye. And to hys purpoſe he doth alledge the example of Pharao. Now tell me how it is poſſible that God can forſe in vs any good, if he determin not to geue it vs. Thou wilt ſay, he ſaw that ſome could vſe well frewil and ſome not▪ therfore he choſe the firſt, and
 refuſed the ſeconde, they coulde not vſe it wel, wythout his grace. Wherfore then did he determyne to geue yt grace of wel vſyng to the one and not to the other?
               It behoueth to returne to the deuine wyll, and ſay, becauſe it pleaſed hym not: for the vſing wel of fre wyl is the effecte and frute and not the cauſe of election. Peraduēture thou wylte ſaye, he dyd determyne to geue grace to all, but he ſawe that ſome wold vſe it wel and thoſe he choſe, and ſome euel, and thoſe he forſoke. But tell me, the vſe of that grace is alſo the gyft of god, wherfore dyd he not determine to geue that grace to all, & alſo to vſe it? Thou muſte nedes ſayat laſte alſo, becauſe it pleaſed hym not. If yu wylte ſay, thoſe that vſed it not well, was not becauſe they lacked y• grace to vſe it, no more then the other, but they dyd not occupye
                     •
                  t when they had it, the defalt was theirs and not of God, nor of the grace. If it were ſo, we ſhuld haue wherin to glorye in our ſelues. But Paul is in the contrarie, & willeth that to God ought to be rendred all honour and glorye,i. Cori iiii. ſo as frō hym commeth al goodnes. We might alſo of our ſelues,Rom. iiii. ſeperate vs frō the reprobate,i. Timo. i. and ſo our hope ſhuld not be al wholy in God, our ſaluaciō could not be certeyn and ſure,Iacob. i. as Chriſt ſaide: nor
 the cauſe of our eleccion ſo hidde,Ihon. x. as Paule ſaieth it is,Ro. viii. vi ix, and. xi. yea fre mercye ſhuld be no more fre merci, if we might be ſaued by worckes and paradiſe ſhuld be a rewarde, and not a gyfte cleane agaynſt Paule. The Hebrues dyd mo worckes thē the gentils, and neuer theles he did choſe the gentils, and reproued the Iewes, that ſoughte to be iuſtified by theyr workes. God from the beginning for ſawe in vs nothing but repugnancy and rebelliō agaynſt his grace, being by the ſinne of Adam,Epheſ. ii. the childrene of ire, prone and enclined to all euyl.Gene. viii. Paul calleth our election the eleccion of fre mercye.Roma. xi. Dauid ſayth: he ſaued me,Pſal. xvii. ii. Reg. xxii becauſe he loued me, and becauſe it pleaſed him. He ſaueth then his electe becauſe he delyteth in them,Pſal. xliii. i. Cor. ii. and dyſtrybuteth hys mercy, after his own wyl. Thē he hath begotten vs voluntarily by mere mercye,Iacob. i. and not by our workes:Ihon. xv. ſo that the, xii. Apoſtels dyd not choſe Chriſte, but he choſe thē to the Apoſtelſhip. So wee be not they that haue choſen God to ſaue vs, but God is he that hathe choſen vs to ſaluacion. Euen as Paul was called withoute workes by free mercy,Actes. ix. becauſe it pleaſed God: ſo he was elected to ſhewe his mercye,Galath, i, i. Tim. i. and the aboundaunt ryches of his glorie. It is humility it ſelfe,Epheſ. ii. to beleue that we are choſen by grace
 Thys opynion geueth al glory to god, and to vs onlye confuſion. And becauſe we can not erre in glorifying to much the fre mercye and bountye of God, and a batinge the pryde of man. Therfore it is moſt ſure, yea, although it ſtode not wyth the holye ſcryptures as it doth. And the more it diſpleaſeth the carnal man, becauſeit cōfoundeth al his glory, ſo much the more it is pleaſing to the ſpiritual becauſe it magnifieth God, Chriſt his fre mercy, & the goſpel. And to ſay my opinion it pleaſeth me beſt, to be all wholy in the hande of God. Yea if mine elecciō wer in my cuſtody, I wold (if I myghte) render it vnto God, in whoſe hand it muſt of force be better and more ſure. Yea woe to vs if in the leaſt point it did depend vpō our ſelues. Sethen what becommeth of them that imagine (although falſely) that it dependith only vpon the goodly workes that they do, to make thē ſelues elected again, wher on ye other partie, yu ſhalt ſe that thoſe which with lyuely faith, beleue to be by the mere mercy of God, and by the deathe of Chriſte, in the noumber of the electe, and ſonnes of God (for that they fele in Chriſte and by Chriſt, the greate charitie of God) are by ſtrengthe of the ſpirite and loue, forced to do worckes to bee wondered at: not ſeruile, for they ſee
 them ſelues heyres, but the workes of a ſon ſincere and pure to the glory of their lyuely father, beynge preuented by ſoue. If thou woldeſt beleue, we ar
                     •
                   not worthy to be ſo elected by fre mercy, I wold anſwer, nether that Chriſt ſhuld ſuffer for vs vpō the c
                     •
                  oſſe but dyd he not therfore die? Chriſt hath not elected vs, becauſe we were worthy therof, but for the glory of his goodnes:Ephe. i. The cauſe of oure eleccyon is not theu to bee ſoughte, but at the deuyne wyll.
               Of the reprobat, I entend not to dyſpute wherfore god hath caſt them of, becauſe it is nether nedeful to vs nor profitable to know It ſerneth to humble vs, and to knowe better ye great goodnes of God, that we are elected by his grace, and not by our workes. The Chriſtiane oughte to beleue to be one of the choſen,Ephe. 
                        •
                     . i. Cor. ii. v. and it ought to ſuffiſe hym to haue Chriſte for hys booke, in the whych he ſeeth hymſelfe electe, and to knowe that that apperteyneth to hym. And althoughe Paule to the Romanes ſpake a worde therof it was but incidently or by the waye, for it doth apeare it was not his pr
                     •
                  ncipal intēt to ſeke the cauſe wherfore God dothe reprobate and caſte them of. It is inoughe for vs to thynke y• the omnipotencyye of God, beyng infinite, hath neither limites nor bōdes
 therfore may he do with his creatures with out contradiccion: and the deuine wyl may do of them, determine and wyll al that, that with his whole power he maye do, beynge the whole ruler, and neceſſarily moſt ryght in all hys wyll, yea the very ryghtuouſnes it ſelfe. Wherfore honoringe the bright and lyght iudgementes of God, lette vs beleue that God dothe not condempne, but wyth iuſt and irreprehēſible counſayle, albeit the iuſtice of his iudgementes be to vs incomprehenſible, and that none is in hell, but by hys owne wyckednes: Our office is then to humble vs,Rom. xi. and cōtent vs in the deuine wil, reknowledgyng that we be not worthy, although we ſuffer al puniſhment, to ſetforth the brightnes of the glory of god, to whom, for al his workes, is due all honoure, laude and glorye by Ieſus Chriſte oure Lorde.

                     . iii. i. Ihon, iii. ii. Theſſ. ii. god ſeeth frō ye beginning & foreuer al things, & hath of alcertein & infallible ſcience, & particularly knoweth his elect, their life & their end So then as god, by the neceſſiti of his being
 cānot be corrupted, nether diminiſh nor augment, being infinite and wythout ende, nor be altered, beyng moſt ſimple and pure, nor chaunge place, beynge vnmeaſurable, fyllyng al places: ſo alſo maye not his determinacions be chaunged:Roma. ix. neither by ignoraūce for lacke of foreſight and conſideracion, neither for defaulte of power, ſince he can not be letted or weakened, nor his wyl reſiſted. Neyther may he chaunge by malyce, or for want of plētiful goodnes, for hys purpoſes are mooſte good and fyrme.Mala. iii. God then is immutable in all hys doynges, chaungeth not as chyldren, nor lyke olde men, but as Dauid ſaith. The counſayl of the lord ſhall ſtande for euer: that muſt nedes be that god hath determined, neither is it in our power to chaunge his purpoſe, diſturbe the diuine counſayles, deſtroye dyuyne ordinaunces, nor lete hys wyll, whych is Empreſſe, and oures of the hand mayden. Therfore what God wylleth, muſte bee, and not y• he muſt wyl after our phantaſye. Nowe becauſe we are not to be elected,Ephe. i. but (as Paul wryteth) God hath elected vs before the conſtitucion of the worlde, and is in hys determanacions immutable, it is of force therefore to be as he hath determyned. So lyke wyſe he ſeeth and knoweth all thynges from the begynnyng,
 wyth cerreyne & infallible knowledge: it is therefore neceſſitie that, that bee,whyche he hathe foreſeene, or elles it muſte nedes be that God maye chaunge, and that of oure lyte and eude he hathe no perfecte knowledge, but a doubtful opynyon, wher in alſo he may be beguyled, and that ſaying were a moſt wyckednes. Thou wylte ſaye to me, thou arte deceyued in imaginynge that aboue is tyme, and ſucceſſion of tyme, and that God hathe foreſeene and determyned all that is yet to be, ſo that hys determynacyon and knowledge is al ready paſſed, in ſuche ſorte, that he can not other wayes, knowe, nor wyl, wythout hys chaunge whiche is impoſſyble. And therfore thou iudgeeſt it neceſſytye, that all that come to paſſe, whyche he hath foreſeene and determyned, But it is not ſo, for aboue there is no ende or ſucceſſyon of tyme, nyght nor daye, neyther was nor ſhal be, as there is here vnderneath the heanens, ther is onlye all the preſente tyme, and onlye one mooſte clere day of one inſeperable inſtaunte, the whyche by hys eternitie extendeth to the ſucceſſion and proceſſe of all tyme. And I anſwere, that I knowe ryghte wel, that to▪ God euery thing is preſente, although beyng vnder thys celeſtial Shpere, where is folowing of tyme.
 to make vs better vnderſtand, we vſe wyth Paule to ſaye he hathe elected vs: but tell me, doeſt thou beleue that the eleccyon of thoſe that are in thys preſent lyfe, and lyke wyſe thoſe that ſhall be, is nowe in beynge in effecte and preſente before God, or not? If thou ſayeſt no, thē ſhal it neuer be, for wt him is no time to come. If thou ſai yea, then maye it not be withoute mutacion in God, ſence thou graunteſt it once to be.
               If thou woldeſt ſaye it myght be no beynge, yet it coulde not be no beynge, but in the inſtaunt of the godhead, in whych thou graunteſte all thynges to bee, for as muche as aboue is no ſucceſſion or courſe of tyme, and ſo iu that ſelfe inſtaūt in diuiſible, thou woldeſt haue it poſſible, not to be any thing and yet a beyng: for aſmuche as it is not ſo. Therfore if thou conſente that God (I ſaye not hath ſene) but doth ſe and determyne al thynges, ſence that God is immutable, and his ſciēce infallible, & that ther is no courſe of tyme, by all meanes, lykewyſe it is to be ſayde, that, that muſt nedes be, which God with parfect infallible knowledge doth for ſee, and ſtedfaſtly determyne. Becauſe that (if with God there were any time paſt) euē as that coulde not be whyche God hadde foreſene by his infallible precence, and immutably
 determined: no more cā that thing not be, which he doth preſently ſe and determyne. Thou wylt ſay, I graunt that al that ſhal be, which God doth foreſe and ordeyn and ſo God ſhall not bee begyled, nor yet chaunge, but yet neuertheles it myght be yt cōtrary although it ſhal neuer be. But thou 
                     •
                  eeſt not how thou art deceyued, thou graū
                  teſt that al the electe ſhal be ſaued, neuertheleſſe thou ſaieſt they may be dampned: And wherto ſerueth this, may be, if in effect thei ſhall not be dampned. Therfore thys argueth but in wordes, it is courtouſe and vnprofytable. Nowe as if thou woldeſt graunte that an elect could be dāned, thou ſhuldeſt be forced to ſaye that God maye chaunge. Therfore thou ſayeſt, that all may be ſaued whych argueth yet that the elect may be dā
                  ned, and ſo thou muſte nedes confeſſe, that god may alſo be begyled, & vary in his ordinaunce, which is impoſſible. That the elect then may be dampned, it is a thynge falſe, heretycal, and vnpoſſyble: it can not be verefied by no ſentence compound nor deryued ſence that in God cā be no mutaciō nor ſucceſſiō. Therfore if he be elect, he muſt nedes be ſaued, and it muſt nedes be ſayd; that the eleccion of them that ſhall be ſaued (I wyll not ſay hath ben but ſtanding in that eterni

                  teth (as Paule writeth) it is of neceſſirye to ſay that the electe be ſaued.Roma. xi Paule wryteth that the elecciō of God is firme, and the diuine purpoſes ſtedfaſte, and that the Lorde knoweth his wyth perfect infallible knowledge,Roma. iiii. whych ought to be to vs a ſure foundacyon,Roma. ix. whereupon we maye ſtablyſhe vndoubted fayth of our ſaluaciō. To this purpoſe Paule ſayd, that thoſe that God hath knowen for his, and therfore elected & purpoſed to ſaue them, thoſe he hath predeſtynate to be conformable to the Image of his ſonne, and thoſe hauynge them after created, he doth call wyth an inward callynge,in ſuch ſort, that they aunſwere agayne, for becauſe they are the ſōnes of God, therfore they heard hys voyce, and beleue by beinge ordeined to eternall lyfe. Yea he draweth them, and geueth them a newe hearte, and theſe that he calleth he iuſtifyeth, he geueth them Chriſt, and the 
                     •
                  yght of hym, faythe, hope, and charity, and all other chriſtyane vertues apparelynge them, he doth enriche
 them wyth many gyftes, treaſurs, and graces, & afterward doth happely glorify them Therefore from the fyrſte to the laſte it foloweth, that the electe muſt nedes he ſaued. Paule added and ſayd: if God be wyth vs, who can be agaynſte vs: meaninge, if God hath elected vs, and determined to ſaue vs, he beynge omnipotente, and hathe taken vp on him this enterpriſe to ſaue vs, who ſhall let him? Yea he would haue ſayde, no man, becauſe that Chriſte ſayde,Ihon. x. none can take them out of the handes of my father: it happeneth not to God as to man, whyche manye tymes doeth wyll a thynge, ſeketh and canne not fynde,Roma. xi as the Hebrewes whyche ſought theyr ſaluacyon, and coulde not atchieue it, and that becauſe they foughte it not by Chriſt, by fre mercye, nor by faythe but by workes. It is not ſo wyth God, becauſe that he, when he wylleth any thynge, it commeth to paſſe, and his elecciō (as writeth Paule) commeth to effecte. Moreouer God hath geuen hys electe to Chriſte,Ihon. x. xi. and. xvii. and braweth them to hym, and thoſe that go to hym drawen of the father, he chaſeth not awaye, as hym ſelfe ſayde: he loſeth them not, but knoweth them for hys ſhepe, he calleth them to hym, they heare hys voyce, he prayeth for them moſte effectuouſly, and is
 euer hearde. For them he ſhed hys bloude, and gaue his life,Math. xvi euen as for them onely he was ſent, and came into the world, to them he doth manyfeſt God, geueth theym lyfe, and maketh them happye. They are then in good handes, beinge in Chriſtes, out of the whyche non
                     •
                   ſhall take them, as hym ſelfe hath ſayde. They may peryſhe that are the ſonnes of perdicion,Ihon. xi. and. xvii. as Iudas, but not the chyldren of eleccion. The elect are ſure, for ther was neuer one of them that peryſhed nor neuer ſhal,Mat. xiii. yea it is vnpoſſible, for chriſt ſpeking of y• fals prophets which ſhould be in y• kingdō of Antichriſt, ſaid they ſhuld ſeduce the very elect, if it were poſſible, for to ſhew that it was nor 
                     •
                  oſſible, yea for theyre ſakes, thoſe dayes ſhall be ſhortened.
               Al that God hath wrought aud ſhal worke is for his electe, for whome he dyd create the world, & preſerue the ſame, ſente Chriſte into the world, and wylled that for them he ſhuld dye vpon the croſſe, for them he hath mooſt ſpeciall care. If God made ſuche accompt of yt Hebrues,Deut. xv. yt to thend their name ſhuld not be forgottē on yt earthe, he dyd ordeine, yt if y• firſt brother died without chyld the ſeconde was bounde to rayſe vp ſede to his brother: thinkeſt thou yt he wil not make rekning of his elect whoſe nams are writtē
                   in heauen? Yea, I wyll thou know, that although Chriſte be he,Luke. x. by whoſe meanes all ye elect are ſaued, neuertheles not by his impotēcy, being geuen to hym all power,Marke. x. mat. xxviii but becauſe the thynge of it ſelfe is impoſſible. Chriſt cā not ſaue a reprobate, nor dam an elect▪ Now much leſſe is it in oure power, if we be elect, to dāpne our ſelues, or if we be reprobate to ſaue our ſelues, yet ought we not to ceaſe to worke well, becauſe yt if we are ſure to be dampned, we are yet bounde euery way, for his infinite goodnes, mooſte highly to honour him. Let vs then geue thā 
                  
                     •
                  ses to god that hath not only by mere mercy elected vs for his, but to thend we might be ſure of our ſaluaciō, hath ordeyned yt our dampnacion ſhal not lye in our own power (beyng his electe) and wyth thys geueth vs ſuch grace, that we may in thys preſente life, render him al laude, honour, and glory by Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.

               ¶The .xxii. Sermon.
               Whether God do agrauate, harden and blynd the heartes of men or not, and in what maner.
               IT is reade in the holye ſcriptures,ii. Reg. xvi iii. Re. xxix ii, Re. xxiiii that God put in Saul a wycked ſpirit to vexe him & a liyng ſpirit in the mouth of ye prophetes
 to begyle Achab,Exod. i. vii x. xi. & xiiii Eſay. xliii. Ihon. xii. ii. Cor iiii. Rom. ix. xi Galat. iii▪
                   & that by Sathan he moued ye hert of Dauid to nūber the people agaynſt his precepte. And moreouer he doth harden, blynd, and make groſſe ye hertes of perſons, and geueth them ouer into a peruerſe mynd. And Paul wryteth, that he hath ſhut vp al mē in vnbeleif & ſinne. And although manye helde for vngodlines this maner of ſpeaking, & therfore thei do not only abſtayn frō pronoūcing ſuch like words but alſo go about to expoūd & make thē better, emēdinge them, forcecyng thē ſelues to bring them after their phantaſye, to ſuche a way, yt they haue a kind of godlines therin. And I thynke they are moued to do this, to thend yt of theſe things men ſhould not take occaſion to thinke that God were the cauſe of ſynne, or els to imagine wyth the Maniches to be .ii. firſt beginnings, the one good cauſe of the good, the other euell cauſe of ye euell▪ Neuertheleſſe I will not, oughte not may not wyll to be more holye then God, that ſpeaketh in holye ſcriptures. And it is more wyckednes to wyl to correct the tōge of the holy goſt, becauſe that none ſpeaketh nor can ſpeake more circūſpectlye then he, nor with greater thyrſt of our ſaluacion, wt the zeale and honour of God. With al this euery one oughte to knowe that we are the
 cauſe of ſynne and not God: yea it can not be thought, that God is a God, if it be not thought, that he is wythout faulte, without euell infinitely good and iuſt. Therefore as to vs is due all coufuſion, ignominie, diſhonor, reproch and euel, ſo to God al honour, laude, and glory. It is not euel then to pronoūce theſe wordes, to the maner that they are writtē, ſaying that God doth agrauate, harden, and blynd, but it is good.
               Thou wylte ſaie, tell me how theſe wordes are to be vnderſtande, that God dothe harden, blynd, aud ſuch ſyke: ſo that thereby I may not take any occaſion of offēce. I aunſwere, that after the opynyon of ſome, God doth harden, and ſo blynde the hearte of a perſon, in as muche as he foreſe
                     •
                  th and fore preacheth his hardenes, as he did foreſe and foreſay the obſtinacye of Pharao. But knowe thou, that when he ſayde to Moſes, I wyll harden the hert of Pharao, he wold not onely ſaye, I forſee that he wyl be harde hearted, and I tel it the before, for then the wordes whiche he ſpake after, ſhoulde not haue agreed therwyth, whyche were: for to ſhewe my power, that my name may be declared throughoute the whole worlde.
               But wyth thoſe wordes he threatened to punyſhe hym, as it is read that he puniſhed
 mo people for theyr ſinnes, wyth blyndyng them,Dent. ii. Eſay. vi. Ihon. xii. Pſal. lxxx. Roma. i, hardenynge them, wyth lettyng them do after theyr deſyres of their owne hertes geuinge them ouer into a frowarde mynd, in paſſions and ſhamefull effectes.
               Therefore there are ſome whyche ſaye that God manye tymes dothe harden and blynde ſinners, when ſuffering, yea geuing them proſperitie, and diſtributyng his mercy and benefytes, when they ought to open theyr eyes to ſo greate be
                     •
                  ignityes of hym, and be inuited therby to repent and change theyr lyfe, they, of thys boūty of God take occaſion to become worſe, euery daye more blynde and indurate. But I ſaye that the vertue and alſo the vice ſtandeth not in proſperity nor yet in aduerſytye, but in the men them ſelues. So that as to the electe euerye thing worketh to ſaluaciō,Rom. viii. and by the ſpeciall grace that they haue of God ſerue hym in aduerſitie as in proſperiti: ſo to the reprobate, euery thyng ſerueth contrarye, & hurteth, yet by theyr defalts as not only proſperity & aduerſity, but alſo yt preching of ye goſpell, & the miracles do hurt & hynder them. Therfore Paule ſaid, yt as to ye elect Chriſte was the odour of life, ſo to the reprobate, he was the odour of death.ii. Cori. ii. It is nedefull then to ſay that God doth harden and blinde the
 heartes of the reprobate, not becauſe he geueth thē aduerſiti or proſperiti, nor becauſe he ſuffreth thē, & ſheweth them many benefites, but for that he geueth them not grace to vſe them, & the commodyte therof, to the glory of God: It may be truly ſayd that he dothe hurden & blinde the hertes of the ſynners, when he taketh from them, or gyueth thē not hys grace, nor the vnderſtanding of hys wil becauſe that in ſuch caſe, it is force that mā wil remayne blynd and indurate, & that euery thynge ſerue them, to the dyſhonor of God, where as if they hadde that inward grace euē of theyr ſynnes, they ſhuld ta
                     •
                  e occaſiō to honour him, god doth blynd men, whē with drawyng hys lyghte, he hydeth his face,Deu. xxxi. & as Moſes was vayled, ſo ſpredeth he the vayle of ignorance ouer the hert of the reprobate:ii. Cor. iii. ſo that god in wt drawing his lyght of his grace, blyndeth the hert of infydels, in ſuche ſorte, that not onely the goſpel is hyd from them (as Paul writeth) and they erre, but ſtandynge in that darckenes, they cānot beleue, And ſo alſo doeth he harden,ii. Theſſ. ii. not for that he geueth proſperity or aduerſity (of the which the elect alſo are partakers) nor becauſe he withdraweth not the grace,Ihon. xii. but the ſwetenes and the ſenſuall felyng therof, of the which many ſaintes wer
 voyde: nor yet for that he moueth their hertes to euell, or cauſe in them any obſtancye or euell qualite:Ezech. xi. but only in wythdrawynge hys grace, whych molifieth a herte of ſtone and maketh it fleſhe, it is of neceſſitye yt the hert remayn hardened. And ſo lykewyſe he chaſeth away yt ſinner, whē he doth not call hym, & draw hym to hym before, Yet for all this god ſinneth not, for he is not holdē nor boūd to geue vs this grace, he may hardē & mollify after his owne pleaſure, yea the ſinner meriteth not only to be punyſhed wyth payne and priuacion of paradyſe, but alſo wyth priuacion of his grace: and that thys is true, iudge, if God had kylled Pharao, when he cauſed all the Hebrues chyldren to be caſte into the floude: wouldeſt thou haue ſayd that God had bene vniuſt? Surely no And yet if then he had dyed, he had bene dāned, & remayned obſtinate for euer. Where fore myght not god execute iuſtly, the ſame ſentence, as concerning blyndyng and hardening, vpon others wyth wythdrawynge hys grace? And on the other partye (as they are preſerued) that ſhalbe not amiſſe to preſerue him in life for a few mo daies to be ſerued of hym, as of an inſtrument of wrathe prepared from the begynnyng, to excerciſe his people in vertue, to thende that delyuering
 them ſo diuinelye,Rom. ix. they myghte knowe the great goodnes, power, & iuſtice of god. And ſo beyng his name celebrate throughoute the world,Exo. xxiiii. he myght be feared & loued. And finally all to hys owne glory,Pſal. lxxi. as waxteth Paul & Moſes. The iudgementes that we geue vpon the ſecrets of God, are verye madnes,Rom. viii. if by faith we do not enter into his ſantuarye. God doth inwardlye call the electe, as Paul wryteth, and they beleue that god, as theyr only father, wyl neuer forſake them, but ſhall endue thē wyth ſuch grace, that al thynges ſhal ſerue them to ſaluaciō, euen ſinne, in the whych god wil neuer lette them fall, but for theyr benefyte. They art not offended to heare ſaye,Rom. viii. that god by abſtaining his grace from the vngodlye doth blynd and harden theyr hertes, but vnderſtandinge by fayeth to be in the number of the electe, and knowing that god ſaueth not but by mercye, and dainneth not but iuſtly, ſo much the more are they moued to lyue in pure feare, to humble them ſelues, & render thankes to god, to whom be euer all laude, honour and glory, through Ieſu Chriſt our Lord. Amen.
            
            
               ¶The .xxiii. Sermon.
               ¶How God doth diſpoſe his grace.
               
                   THere are manye whyche thyncke that god to euery one cōtinuallie doth offer his grace, and that it is in the power of man to accepte it or not, as though
                     •
                   they had it in a boudget, & were in their arbytrement to open and take at their owne wyll. And that of thys their dead, falſe, & erronyous opinion, groweth yt they liue moſt wickedly, thynking & ſaying: god neuer faileth wyth hys grace, and it is at our choiſe to receyue it at oure wyll.
               Therfore we may take leiſure & lyue a vicious life after our owne way, for we ſhalbe ſaued always, a moment of time is enough for vs to repent & be ſaued, ſence it is in our power. Therfore for to flye ſuch an euell, I haue iudged it good to ſhewe yt it is not ſo It is no doute yt God hath created y• world for his electe, ſo that if god had forſene that none ſhould haue bene ſaued, he would not haue created it.Hebrues. i. i, Corin. i. Rom. viiii. For thē alſo he dyd preſerue it, to them he hath geuen the Angels for kepers, and of them as a father he hath moſte ſinguler care & prouidēce. God wil not ſuffer yt they be tēpted aboue their power, yea euery thing worketh & ſerueth well to their ſaluaciō. Seuē times in a dai y• iuſt ſhal fal & riſe againe,Pro. xxiiii. becauſe God is with thē, and
 helpeth them in ſuch ſort, that the more thei are in great perils & neceſſity, ſo muche the more is god beneficial to them. For thē god gaue the law to the world, ſent Moſes and the Prophetes, them he calleth inwardly in ſuche maner, that they heare his voice, and anſwere him of them he mollifieth the hert, and draweth them to Chriſt, as the adamāt doeth Iron: If they erre, he dothe correcte and chaſten them as chyldren, as it is reade of Dauid,Pſa. xxxi. to them he doth not impute theyr ſynne,Ihon. x. he doth quicken and glorify thē, and finally al that god hath wrought,Ihon. ix. and ſhall worke for him ſelfe, is for the elect, for them he ſent Chriſt, and when he came, for them he toke vpon hym theyr ſynnes, only for thē he prayed, for them he wepte, preached, and dyd miracles, for them he ſhed hys bloude, dyed, roſe, aſcended into heauen, ſent the holye goſte, and ſhal come to iudge the quicke and the deade: yea all that he hath ſuffered wrought and ſhall worcke, is for the electe, whom he loueth in ſo exceſſiue maner, that he doth atribute to hym ſelfe al that is done to them,Ihon. x. God then beyng gratified with the elect in Chriſt, doth geue vnto them his ſpirite, the linelye lyghte of hym, faythe, hope, with al the reſte of vertues & graces eſſencial & neceſſary to ſaluacion. And moreouer
 he geueth them grace to vſe in the honor of god, and be ſerued in his glorye, of all the gyftes and graces which may be commune both to the good, & to ye euel, to be vſed well & euel, as riches, honour, dignitye, healthe, long lyfe, chyldrē, frindes, ſciēce, the gyfts of the tonge, to do miracles and ſuche lyke. Of them in parte, Paule made mencyon, writinge to the Corinthes.i. Cor. xii. And alſo geueth them grace to vſe in his glorye, pouerty, ignommie, in fame, infirmitie, wyth al aduerſity, and the priuacion of lyke gyftes, euen to the death, god geueth them ſuch grace y• wyth euery wind, they ſaile to the port, and they know that they are no leſſe bounde to thanke god when they are without ſuch giftes, and in all aduerſitie, then when they haue ſuche things wyth the proſperitye of y• world, ſence that by the grace which god geueth them, al thynges worke to good.
               Therfore they are euer contented to be in the ſtate whych pleaſeth the Lord, neyther wolde they chaunge it, if they myght (with out the wyl of God) and only for that they fele the deuine goodnes, no leſſe in aduerſity then in the worldly proſperite. In thend when they are fallen to any ſinne, god openeth their eies, & maketh thē ſe, not only the euell yt they haue done, but alſo y• he hath ſo
 permited 
                     〈◊〉
                   for then benefite, to thende they may the better know theyr owne miſeryes and the bountye of God. But ſpekyng of ye reprobate, I ſaye that it is inough for vs to knowe that god is not bonde, nor neceſſited to geue them hys grace for theyr good workes: becauſe that the grace findeth no good worckes, but doth make theym to be done, wyth hys creatures The bondes are all oures wyth god, and ſo muche the more as that we beyng all loſſe in Adam, he myghte iuſtly, not only obādon vs, but damne and punyſhe vs. He is not alſo compelled of his perfect goodnes, mercy and charyty to not haue created the worlde, he myghte nowe brynge it to nothinge, and dyſpoſe all creatures after hys owne waye beynge ſtyll moſte perfectelye iuſte, as he is nowe, and was from without beginning, before he did create the worlde. God maye geue of hys grace as much as it pleaſeth him, whē & to whome he thincketh good, yea, and not to geue it without beyng vniuſt, or doyng any iniury.Math. xx. God alſo hath ben of power wythout doing any vnrightuouſnes to creat the reprobat, fore ſeynge theyr dampnacyon to ſerue his owne turne, and to vſe them for in ſtrumentes, or exerciſe the elect in vertue, to
 the ende that their victories and triumphs, & likewiſe Chriſtes, myght be the more glorious, & finally al for his own greter glory.
               And moreouer I ſaye,Ihon. vii. that Chriſte hydeth hymſelfe and hys grace manye tymes from perſons,Prou. i. ſo that althoughe they ſeeke hym, crye after hym, and recommend them ſelues to hym, they fynde hym not, nor he heareth them not, notwythſtandynge thoſe ſuch as are not moued to ſeke hym, or cōmit them ſelues to hym, by the ſpirite, nor for the zeale of the honour of God, but for their proper intereſt, yea and many times he doth blynde and indurate the people, and all is moſt iuſtly done. And although it be writtē y• God hath 
                     •
                  ure of al, calleth al, wold ſaue all, dyed for all, doeth illumynate all, dothe rayne and power his grace vpon all, & lyke ſentences: I ſay, it is to be vnderſtand, that he hath cure of al ingeneral, but of the elect in ſpecial, and ſo he calleth al, with a vocacion vniuerſall, but the elect with an inwarde and ſinguler. When Paule ſayd alſo, that he wold ſaue all, he vnderſtode that, to be of euery ſorte of perſons. Hys death alſo was ſufficient to ſaue al, but it is not effectuous but to the elect, and ſo where it is writtē, y• he doth illuminat and geue grace to al▪ it is vnderſtand of ye elect of thoſe that are illuminate.
 Therfore ſayde Chriſte to the Apoſtles, to you it is geuen to knowe the miſteryes of the kyngdome of heuen,Math. xiii. Paule ſaid lykewyſe,Ephe. ii. that the faith which is the gift of God,ii. Theſſ. ii. is not al mēs. It is wel true alſo, that God doth illumynate al, in aſmuch as ther is no perſon that hath not had ſome lyght & knowledge of God. Let vs then geue hym thankes, ſence that of hys mere goodneſſe, he hath cōnumerat vs among the elect, and praye we him that he geue vs ſo much light of his goodnes, that in euerye place & tyme we may render him perfect land, honoure and glory▪ by Ieſu Chriſt our Lorde.
               Amen.
            
            
               The .xxiiii. Sermon.
               If a man haue lybertye or not and in what maner.
               SOme myght thynke it ſuperfluous for a chriſtian, to thynke whether he be fre or not, but that it is inoughe to force hym ſelfe to make al poſſible reſyſtence agaynſt euell, and hys beſte power to do well, geuynge all honoure and glorye to God, becauſe that in ſuche a caſe they walke to god ſurely, neyther falling into the depth of idlenes. But herein cōſiſteth the difficulty, in geuinge
 al the glory to god. Yea it is not poſſible that man while arrogātly he preſumeth of hym ſelfe (thinkyng to do that whych he doth not) can geue al the glory to god. Therfore haue I iudged it neceſſarye to ſhewe what man can do, to thend yt beyng hable to knowe and diſcerne betwene that which in dede is hys, and that that is goddes, he can and maye render all prayſe and laude vnto him to whom of duty it belongeth. Fyrſt, al though the beyng of the creatures, compared to the beyng of god (by beyng infinitely far from the perfecciō of the diuine eſſence) is but a ſhadowe,Roms. iiii. yea rather no beynge, ſo that truly it may be ſayde that God only is that which is:Exod. iii. neuertheleſſe wyth al thys, it can not be ſaide but that the creatures haue a beynge, although imperfect, in comparyſon of the diuine. And ſo is it true, that they haue vertue, during the which they worke, although principally in the vertue of God.
               Therfore when the Lord had created the world, he cōmaunded the earth to ſprynge, and the waters to bringe forthe. Then falſe is the opinion of theym that Imagine that god, & not the ſunne dothe geue lyght, & god not the fyre doth geue heate, and ſo of al the reſte of thinges created, that God dothe worke in thē, & not the creatures, but euery
 creature euen to the moſte vile, hath his proper vertue, duringe the whiche, it worketh. True it is, that in the creatures inferiour to man, there is no libertie at all, becauſe that beinge not let, they muſte of neceſſiti worke according to the vertue that thei haue in the diſpoſition of thinges poſſible or ſufferable directlye ſet before them as it is fene in burninge, and ſo it is neceſſarye, they moue accordyng to theyr vertue, ſtrength, and apetyte, the whyche is ſeene in the waters, that runne to the ſea, nether it is in the power of lyuing ſoules vnreaſonable, to moue or not to moue weaklye or ſtrong lye, to the obiectes that they appetyte or deſire. Take away the impedimentes, they muſte of neceſſitye moue them ſelues there vnto, after the meaſure of the ſtrength and apetyte they haue. Therfore in them is no libertie at al, as ther is in man, in whome I conſider fiue ſortes of mouynges and operacyōs. The fyrſt are mere natural as if a mā ſh

                  ntarrlye throw hym ſelf down, it ſhuld not be in hys lybertie to withholde him ſelfe, but ſhoulde be by his weighte, compelled like a ſtone to diſcende euen to the earthe. True it is that the ſame faul was in his liberti, in aſmuche as he myghte not haue throwen hym ſelfe downe at all. The ſeconde monynges that
 I cōſyder in men, are vegatyue, as y•

                  rowynge when they are chyldrē, and noryſhyng and ſuch lyke, the whych alſo doth plantes. And ſpeakynge of choſe, I ſay that they are not in the lybertye of manne, ſauynge that he maye kyll hymſelfe, and depryue hymof that lyfe whych he can not do.
               The thyrde are operacions animall, as to ſee, heare, and taſte, and ſuche lyke, of the whych ſpeakyng, I ſaye that albeit it be in the power of man not to heare a voyce that is preſent wythout cloſynge hys eares, and ſo of the other lyke operacyous, neuertheleſſe it is in hys lybertye to ſhut vp thoſe ſē
                  ces, in the preſence of the obiectes or preſent thyngs y• delyght hym, & to wythdraw hym ſelfe frome them, and ſo not to moue, or to moue to one ſyde or another, ſoftlye or ſtrongly as he wyll, the whych the other anymalles or lyuynge ſoules can not do, beinge neceſſytate, to moue accordyng to their apetytes. But ſpeakynge of the foure operacyons whych are humayne, as to thynke one or an other thynge, to ſpeake or not in thys maner or

 watche, praye, to heare the word of God, to communicate or not, and ſo of all the other like operacions, I ſaye, that they are in the power of man, that is that men (without other ſpecial grace and miracle but only duringe the generall influence of God) haue in their power to do them, & alſo not to doo them, and alwaies they ſhal do them, if thei effectuouſlye ſhal wil to do them, not being letted of God, or of ſome other ſtronger thē they, and ſo alſo ſhall they not do them beinge not forced, and not willinge to do thē, men are not images. Yea that they are free in thinges humane, it is ſo cleare, that it can not be declared by a rule more knowne, but ſpeakinge of the laſte worckes, that are holie, ſpiritual and deuine, the which are gratfull and acceptable to God, as to haue liuely lyght, and ſpirituall knowledge and vnderſtandinge of god, to haue in hym fyrme faythe and hope, to loue him, honoure hym, aud reuerence hym, wythal thy hearte, to order all thy lyfe to his glorye, to obeye and commit thy ſelfe wholy to his gouernaūce wyth mortifying and denying thy ſelfe, the fleſhe and his owne prudence, and to loue thy neyghbour as thy ſelfe, euen to thy enemies for the lo

                  e of god, wyth the hearte to praye for thē, and do them al the good poſſible:
 And finallye to do ſuche worckes to the glorye of god is not in the lybertye of them that are carnal, & not regenerate by Chriſt, becauſe that it is not in their power to haue the ſupernatural knoweledge of god, ſence it is aboue all their myght.
               It is not alſo in theyr power to haue liuely faythe in God, hope, and charitye, for as muche as they are the gyftes of god, diuine vertues & ſupernatural. Therfor it is not in theyr libertie to honour god in any wyſe as is due to hym, and that thys is true, let thē proue to make experience in them ſelues, in deuoringe theym to haue more knoweledge of god then they haue, to haue in hym greater faythe and hope, and to loue hym more, and they ſhal perceyue that it wil not come to effecte: wherof it foloweth that being not in yt power of infidels, and not regenerate by Chriſt to loue God wyth al theyr hearte no nor aboue al other thynges, that alſo it is not in theyr power, not to loue the thynges created, but in Chriſte and by Chriſt, nether is it in theyr power, not to loue them ſelues dyſordynatelye, or theyr parentes, fryndes, dygnyty, honoure, goodes, pleaſures, & the reaſte of thynges that are to them profytable, commodyons and delectable, and more ouer it lyeth not in theyr power, not to hate

                   howe it is in theyr power to loue them ſpecyally ſpyrytuallye in Chriſt: and to the glory of God ſuche like paſſyons and effectes are not in oure power, as euery one hathe experyence contynuallye in hym ſelfe.
               A wycked man myght abſteyn from kyllyng hys enemy, when he might do it, yea & do hys beſt to healp hym, but it ſhoulde not be in hys power, to loue hym in hys hearte, and much leſſe in Chriſte and to God.
               Therefore all be it, it is in hys libertye not to kyll hys enemye and ſo to do hym good, neuertheleſſe it is not in his power, to refrayne from kyllynge hym, or to do hym anye benefyte for the glory of god. The vngodlye myghte, wyth all hys connyng and power conſyder all thoſe thynges that ſerue to the dyſprayſe of the worlde, to the mortifyinge of them ſelues, to the louing of theyr neyghbour and alſo god: yet by no meanes ſhould they come to ſuch lyght of the goodneſſe of God, of theyr owne myſeryes and vanyty of the worlde, that they ſhould loue God to the hate of theym ſelues, and dyſprayſe of the worlde, as he is bounde to do.
               It is not then in the lyuertye of the carnall man to do worckes ſpyrytual, he hathe neede of the grace of God, of faythe, and
 knowledge ſupernaturall, nor it is not 
                     〈◊〉
                   hys power to get, neyther in all nor in part any gyft of God, grace or ſpiritual vertue. Yea before that by Chriſt he be regeuerate, he can not neyther wyth thynkynge, deſyring, or working, nor by any other meanes dyſpoſe or prepare hym ſelf neyther whole nor partelye, to one of the leaſte graces of god: ſo that by thoſe hys thoughtes, deſires or worckes, he maye be worthye, or haue i
                     •
                   all or in parte deſerued that grace.
               And moreouer I ſaye, that as before hys regeneracion he is vngodly & wicked, euen ſo is ſin al his thoughtes, deſires, & workes and this is, bicauſe that while he is carnall, beinge the ſeruaunte of ſinne and concupyſcence whiche reigneth in hym, he is dead to God, and a lyue to him ſelf, he neither doth worcke nor can worcke, to the glory of god as he is bound, for want of y• liuely light of him, but being as he is carnal & in hys own loue he is moued to woorcke, onlye for hys owne intereſt, he ſinneth then, not for doing almoſſe and lyke woorckes, but for that he doth them not for the glory of God. And althoughe the vngodlye abſteine ſome tymes from robbinge and killinge, with ſuch like wicked iniquities, yet alwais he ſinneth (although not ſo muche) not in abſteining, but
 that he abſteineth not for the loue of God as he is bounde to do, but for hys owne proper accompte intereſte and vtylitie. And ſo is it true in carnall manne, whyle he is carnal, ſynne doth euer reygn, for that he cānot but ſinne,Rom. viii. yea and euer doth ſynne contynuallye,Rom. ix. becauſe that althoughe he abſteyne from homicide,Roma, vii. thefte and committing ſuch like iniquities, neuertheleſſe he ſinneth euer continually, in leauing behind him the loue of God wythall hys hearte, as he ought to loue his neyghbour as hym ſelf, to worcke for the health of hys neyghboure & the glorye of God as he is bounde, abſteining for hys honoure from all ſynne. Their ſynnes are then innumerable, and yet they thincke in confeſſyon to number them al being then al the worckes of the carnal, ſynne and worthye of punyſhmente: ſee howe they can by any meanes be worthy to be rewarded, and how they may be true preparacions, or dyſpoſycyōs to grace? Therfore as a deade mā cānot rayſe hym ſelf, or worke toward hys reſurreccyō, nor he that is not, worke to his creatyon,Epheſ. ii. ſo the carnall man, that in Adam is dead,Rom, iiii, and as though he were not can not worke towardes hys regeneracyō and creation, yea euen as a humane bodye wythout the ſoule can not moue but downwarde, ſo
 the dead ſoule without the ſpirite & Chriſte, his life, can not lifte hym ſelfe vp, but muſt of neceſſitie deſcende euer downe, in regardinge his owne intereſt.Ihon. iii. Therfore he cānot but ſinne, he muſt be borne again to do worſies ſpiritual and holye, and by oure ſelues we can not be regenerate by no meanes, for it is onlye the worcke of God. It is nedeful then that God creatinge in vs a cleane hert do geuē vs a new hert,Pſalm, l. as Dauid dyd pray and God did promiſe bi his prophets, wyth oute me, ſayth Chriſte, ye can do nothynge, that is ſpiritual, holi and grateful to God. Chriſte then is wholye our rightuouſnes, & this is the more riche noble and happi rightuouſnes, thē if we were iuſte bi our ſelues, yea none ſhuld be iuſte, if oure iuſtice did in any part depēd vpō vs nor our owne glory excluded,i. Tim. i. as Paul and Moſes wylleth it to be.Roma. iiii. There are many that thynke that as mē choſe to ſerue a Prince,Deut, viii. ſo we choſe to ſerue god, but he him ſelfe in the contrary where he ſayd, you haue not choſen me, but I you. Likewiſe they thinke, as they that beſt ſerue obtein moſt fauour of their Lord, & thoſe yt haue loſte it, the more they humble them ſelues, the ſoner they recouer it: ſo they thynke of vs with god. Thus they build their good lyfe,Galath, v. not vpon Chriſte, but on them ſelues,
 and fall from the deuyne grace. And alſo it is clene contrary: for not for that we repent humble vs, and do good worckes, therefore he geueth vs hys grace: but becauſe he geueth vs hys grace, therfore we do worckes that are holy. So that, not for that the good theefe vppon the croſſe dyd confeſſe Chriſt, therefore he dyd illuminate hym, but for that Chriſte dyd illuminate and touche hys herte, therfore he dyd confeſſe hym: and the lyke happeneth of all vs.
               And what good worke dyd Paule when Chriſt conuerted him? He was moſt ſtrongly agaynſt hys honour, euen as we wer before he called vs. Theſe that are not regenerate, be wyth Saincte Peter in a darke priſon, bounde wyth manye cheynes, in the power of the Deuell, a ſleepe in ſynne, and wylte thou that they bee ſaued by them ſelues? No, the Lorde hym ſelfe muſte needes awake hym, the euell tree canne not brynge forthe good frute,Math. vii. as Chriſte ſayde, no more canne the vngodlye good worckes. Before wee are by Chriſt regenerate, we are fleſhe and that whiche ſpryngeth of the fleſhe, is fleſhe.Ihon. iii. Therefore canne we do no ſpirituall worckes, yea euen as Paule ſaythe, all the effectes and deſyres of the fleſhe are death, vncleane are all oure worckes whych procede
 of our corrupte nature, and finallye he that is not with Chriſte, is agaynſte hym.
               God at the begynnynge made man free, but in ſynnynge he was made in ſuche ſorte the ſeruaunt of ſinne, y• not only he can not, neither in al nor in parte, merite before god any grace, but he can not in hys lyght do otherwyſe but ſinne: yet not for this he ſhuld leaue to heare the worde of God, to praye, to take counſayle, to ſeeke to bee corrected, to do almes and lyke woorcks, not for that he doothe deſerue grace but punyſhmente, euen as he that bi force is compelled to hū
                  ble hym ſelfe, and are pardon of hys ennemye, for that fayned humilitye, he meriteth not to be pardoned, but ſhoulde meryte ſo muche the more to be puniſhed, as that, hauyng vniuſtly offended him, he ought wyth hys hearte, to haue humbled hym, and aſked pardon, and hath not done it, Nowe ſo the vngodlye, in aſkinge mercy of God, doeth ſinne, for he that aſketh not for his glory as he is bounde, but for his owne gain, nor therfore he ought to ceaſſe from aſking help of God, for that he ſinneth not in prayinge but for not prayinge in ſpirite, for the glory of God, and withal due circumſtances in that caſe he did partlye obey God, for if he dyd not pray he ſhuld ſynne much more
 greuouſlye. The Samaritane not onlye deſerued not to haue grace of Chriſte, for aſking him water, but for that her demaund ſhe deſerued to be puniſhed, becauſe ſhe did it not in faythe, and to the glorye of God.
               Neuertheleſſe Chriſte would that ſhe ſhuld aſke, and that it ſhoulde paſſe by thoſe meanes. Now ſo he wil that ſinners aſke grace, and do thoſe worckes that he hath commaū
                  ded them, albeit they do them not to the glory of god, beinge blinde to diuyne thinges, yea darkenes it ſelf, as writeth ſaint Ihon. But after the ſinners are regenerat bi chriſt thē as childrē of god,Ihon. x. Ihon. viii. they are free, and not the ſeruauntes of the deuell nor of ſinne becauſe that althoughe in them remaineth the concupiſcence of ſinne, neuertheles they do not conſente to it,Rom. vii. they obey not vnto it. It dothe not reigne in theym, but they haue ſo much lyght of god, & ſo much ſpirit (which helpeth their infirmitie) that thei are ſtirred to the glory of god,Rom. vi. thoughe not wholye as they wolde, for becauſe of the repugnaunte fleſhe. Therfore ſaid Paul, I do not ye good that I wold do,Rom. vii. but the euell that I woulde not.Pſal. xxxi. But ſuche defectes are not imputed to them,Rom. viii. for that they are by faythe graffed in Chriſt. The regenerate by Chriſt are prone and readye to the good, god hathe illuſtrate
 their mind and toutched their herte, in ſuch maner that wyth all their ſoul, voluntarely frely and gladly, they do holye worckes, to the glory of god, ſo that as god counſayled the ſoules of them that dyd elect Dauid to content thē ſelues in their herte to haue him for their kynge, fo he moueth the hert of the regenerate, willingly to haue god for theyr god, to cōmit them to his gouernaūce, and to delight to be gouerned of him, with hounoryng hym as a celeſtyal father. So thē as yt ſonnes of Adam, before they be regenerate are the ſeruauntes of ſynne, for that they cā not but ſinne, & therfor becauſe they can not worcke, wyl, deſyre, nor ſtyrre in any waye to the glorye of god, as they are holden, but only for their carnal cōmodity, by yt whych al men not regenerate, are called fleſhe, not only the body, but the ſoule, the wil, deſires and thoughtes, wythal the reſt, ſo after that they are regenerate, they be fre from ſynne, (for that they can work to the glory of god) and are ſeruauntes of ryghteouſnes. Therfore although, as concerning the ſubſtaunce and being of the bodie and of the ſoule, thei remayne the ſame: neuertheles, where before they were called fleſhly men, and fleſh for that they ſought not but theyr own proper thynges, afterward they are called ſpirituall
 men and ſpirite, in as muche as they ſeke the glory of God, the which they maye do, for that God hathe geuen them by mere grace liuely lyght and ſpiritual feling, and knowledge of his goodnes, yea durynge in them that perfect light, not only they at fre from ſinne, for that thei be able not to ſinne but alſo they can not ſynne, for that they cā not but loue god and worcke to hys glorye.
               And thys is the perfecte lybertye, the beinge fre frome the power to ſinne, and beinge not of power to ſinne, is not to ſinne, Otherwyſe, neyther the ſayntes that are in the other lyfe, nor the Aungels ſhoulde bee perfectly fre, nether Chriſt nor god, for thei cā not ſinne. It is veri true this, yt god ſome time doth let his electe & holy men fal, with drawing his diuine light for a time (yet for their benefits) therfore we are not abſolutely and wholy fre from the power to ſynne, as we ſhalde in the life to come, but thei are fre frō power to ſinne with this cōdiciō, duryng in thē the liuely & actual lyght of god. So thē as the carnal, before their regeneracion are in ſuch ſort the ſeruauntes of ſinne, that they cā not but ſinne, not therfore abſolutely & without condicion, but ſo longe as they haue not the holy light of god, ſo there generate are in like maner fre frō ſinne that
 they cā not ſinne, yea they can not choſe but work wel, yet not abſolutely, but during in thē that liuely & actual light of god. And wt al this, neyther the wyl of the fleſhe is violē
                  ted to wyl euel, nor the wyl of the ſpiryte to wyl wel. And this is, for that the wil cā not worke, but of wyl (therfore willinglye) but if it were poſſible that of any outward power it were forced thē by that violēce, it ſhuld worcke not voluntarilye. And on the other ſyde, it ſhuld worke willingly for yt it could not worke but of the ſame wil yt it is: therefore it ſhuld worke vnwillingly & willingly the which in a maner is vnpoſſible, & implieth cōtradictiō and gainſaying. So thē as if one being a ſlepe wer throwne down from a hyghe place, and in the fallynge ſhulde awake, perceyuynge hys falle, ſhoulde wyllyngly content hym ſelf, and haue pleaſure ſo to fal down to the botome, when he were at the ground, he were well worthy to haue ſhame & puniſhement, not for that he might in his fal with hold himſelfe, for it was not in his choyſe nor lyberty, but for that he did ſo delight and cōtent him ſelf with that fal with his ful wyl, & would it with the herte in ſuch ſorte, that al beit he myght haue had the power to reſtraine that fal, he wold not haue done it. Euen ſo the lyke becōmeth of
 al the chyldren of Adam, that beinge fallen in him, although when thei come to y• yeres of diſcreſſion, & begyn to diſcerne the good from the euel, they perceiue the ſinnes that they do, euery way they do thē volūtarely, delighting therin, ſo that althoughe they be not of power, not to do thē, they ar neuertheles worthy of puniſhmēt, for yt they inſport cōmit them willingly, that if they had power not to do them, yet euery way they wold do them, beinge their wyll ſo malignaūt, as it is. Their wyll then is not vyolented or forced to do euel of ani outward power, but of his owne proper & entiere or inward malyce: And ſo the other party, the regenerate by the gladſome, entier, lyuely, & enflamed light that they haue of the boūty of god, thei are forced to eleuate thē ſelues, wt an amorous violēce (Therfore volūtarily, & wyth perfect lyberty) to god, to whome for euer be all laude, honoure, and glorye, throughe Ieſu Chriſt our Lorde. Amen.
            
            
               The .xxv. Sermon.
               Of the effectes wrought by the ſpirite of God when it entred into the ſoule.
               EVen as Chriſt entring into y• holy city of Ieruſalē,Math. xxi. the whole citi was moued
 ſo moueth the city of the ſoule when Chriſt eutreth therin, ſpecially, ſence from that as from a fort and ſtrong municioned rocke he hathe the greate deuyl to chaſe awaye. And if in the lunatycke ſōne,Luke. xi. Luke. ix. there was a greate commocion, when Chriſt oute of his bodye wold haue drawen the malignaunte ſpirite yt had poſſeſſed hym: thynck what commocion there is, when he chaſeth hym from the ſoule, in the whyche he dwelleth more wyllyngely. And know, that it maketh a cōmocion not onli outward in ceremonies, as do cōmonly y• falſe chriſtians when it is neare Eaſter, but there is a cōmocion within the verye bowels of the ſoule, and inward part of the herte, there is nothing that ſo cā perce the ſoule, as doth the ſpirite of god, when it entreth into it by ſpeciall ſlidinge. Not only it ſpoileth vs of the olde Adam wyth hys concupiſence,Rom. xiii. Ihou. iii. and doth cloth vs with Chriſt wyth all his vertues, but alſo maketh vs to be borne a new, that as if a poore man were ſodenly made an Emperoure, he ſhoulde be wholy chaunged, ſo he that of a vile ſinner, is made the ſōne of God chaūgeth thoughtes, effectes, deſyres and wyll, chaungeth frenſhipes, practiſes, wordes, worckes and life, and of humayne, beaſtly, carnal, earth, and deuelyſhe: he becommeth heauenly, ſpirituall,
 angelicall, and deuine as did Paul goyng to Damaſco, when Chriſt did enter hys hert. Ther was a mutacion, from the ryghte hande of God.Actes. ix. Pſa. lxxvi. i. Regu. xi. Math. xii. When the ſpirite of the Lorde entreth in a perſon, he is chaunged into a nother man, for that diyng to the world, he beginneth to lyne to him ſelf, And if when Chriſt dyd enter into the temple he purged it from thoſe that bought and ſold, thyncke if whē he entreth into the ſpiritual temple, he clenſeth it from euery vnclennes of ſinne,Rom. viii. there reſteth not in it any thyng of dampnacion, he healeth it moſte perfectly, ſo that if the vncleane woman was healed, at the touche of the hemme of Chriſts garment, yu mayſt thinke what it is whē Chriſt in ſpirite entryng into the ſoule, and the perſon with lyuely fayth, imbraceth him wholy for hys. Alſo as when the ſonne beames enter into thy houſe, thou perceiueſt in the ayre, euē to the ſmaleſt mote whych yu couldeſt not ſe before, ſo whē in the ſoule do enter the beames of lyght of the diuine grace, the ſinnes are perceyued in more cleare maner. Yea, as the prodigial ſōne neuer knew nor perceiued truly his own errour,Luke. xv. til with ſuch pitie he was imbraced of his father, & had profe how greate was ye fatherly goodnes and charitie which he had offended: ſo
 the ſinner when he conuerteth & begynneth with the ſpirit to taſte the diuine goodnes, he beginneth alſo to know his malice, pride and ingratitude with the reſt his vnlawful ſinnes.Luke. xvi. He reſtoreth wt Zacheus that which is not his, if Chriſt enter into his houſe and dyſpenſeth the ſuperfluous thynges, yea beyng rych wyth the treaſures of Chriſt, he leaueth al wyth vnmeaſurable loue. He can not participate or take part of the bountye of god that doth not cōmunicate & diſtribut to others. The lyuelye flame muſte nedes breake forth,Ihon. vii. or els beyng ſmoudered it quē

                  not cōprehēd thē ſelfes.i. Peter. i. Therfore not being able to wthold thē ſelues, they ſpring & leape for ioy with Iohn Baptiſt, with his mother they make exclamaciō,Luke. i. Exodi. iiii. Actes. iiii. Math. vii. & as to Zacharye, ſo are their tōges loſed: ſo yt although in prayſyng of god they perceiue with Moſes that they ſtammer and are of an vnlearned tōg,
 neuertheles with the Apoſtles,Math. vii. they can not kepe ſcilence of that which they haue herd, ſene, & felt, wyth the ſpirit, they muſt nedes ſpeake by the ſuperabundaūce of loue, that they haue, they deſire wyth the woman of Samarye, that euery one ſhoulde taſte that which they them ſelues haue had experiēce of.Ihon. iiii. And although for preachynge the goſpell they be perſecuted, for al that they do not deſiſte and leaue of, but triumphing in al, thei perſeuer and go forth euen to the deth,Roma. v. they feele in ſuch ſorte in the herte the charity of god,Actes. v. that not onlye it is ſwete to thē to ſuffer for his loue, but wyth the Apoſtels they reioice therin. And for that they participate of that greate charitie of Chriſte, by beynge his members. Therfore wyth hym they pardon al men, beyng ready to ſhed their bloud and put theyr lyfe for their enemies,Roma. ix. Acts. vii. & with Paul alſo to be accurſed from Chriſte. And this becauſe that as to Stenen, ſo the heauens are opened to them, in ſuche ſorte, that in ſpirite with clere & ſupernatural lyght of fayth, they ſe the glory of god, in hauing geuen his only begottē & dearly beloued ſōne for them vpon the croſſe, they reſt alſo quiet as the ſhyp when Chriſt entered into it, they haue the peace of cōſcyence,Mark. vi. Roma. v. knowing with certeyne fayth, that god by Chriſt & by hys
 mercy, hath pardoned them. They haue alſo quietnes of mynde, in ſuche maner, that thoughe they were in al the perils & neceſſyties of the world, yet alwayes aprouing for iuſt, the iudgemen

Theſe ſuche for that they walke accordyng to the vocacion of god, haue honour of euery enterpriſe that they take in hand, they can not be letted or reſiſted, no more thē God.

They are daylye more firme & ſtablyſhed in good purpoſes to doo euer better, beyng lyfted vp cōtinualy to a greater perfeccion with Paule, althoughe their mind be conuerſaunt in heauen, neuertheles deſcendyng by Chriſtiā pytye,i. Cor. i. to fele the miſeryes of theyr brethren, they laboure alſo to drawe them to Chriſt, and moue thē to haue the ſpirite, & to be in veryty Chriſtianes & not Ipocrites. As ye very grape doth moue the birdes to taſte therof, and not the pyt fal. And finally although with the Apoſtels, they neuer remayne wyth Chriſt and
 wyth the Canauite, whiche woulde not departe for his vngentle wordes, neuertheles they are prompte and ready for his honour and glorye, to leaue wyth the Samaritane hys ſwete preſence.
