doe I ſpeake of loſſe, ſeeing his gaine doth

great commendation, and a rare patterne

the good prouidence of God, that no ſeruice
performed by any other, being comparably
acceptable to his good Master, in his ſickneſſe
and weakeneſſe; God was pleaſed euen
extraordinarily to raiſe him from the gate of
death, to attend his Master. To the cloſing
of his eyes, which ſeruice ended, that he ſhould
haue a relapſe, and in two dayes alſo end his
life. I may ſay of them both, as Dauid did
of Saul and Ionathan, they were louely
and pleaſant in their liues, and in their
death they were not diuided
               2 Sam. 1. 23.; onely this
difference, he that in life time often rode before,

Sorrow, and death: or, a ſorrowing death.

griefe, to breake out into teares is

milde and melting heart

by beſt Examples. Thus did Ieremy lament

            There were principally three things,
which concurred to make Chriſt weep,
and ſo much to increaſe his ſorrow, that
if he had beene but meere man, as he was
true man
               Si meras homo, vt verus homo., hee had doubtleſſe beene foyled
of his paſſion, as many holy men of
God haue beene: viz. 1. the death of Lazarus;
2. the ſorrow of his Siſters. 3. the
miſerie of the Iewes. Someſay that Chriſt
wept not for Lazarus at all; for he knew
that hee would by and by raiſe him
againeQuomodo fleret cum, quem continuò ſuſcitare vellet. Theod. Herac.
               , as he told his Diſciples before,
Lazarus is dead, and I am glad for your
ſakes, that I was not there, that yee may beleeue
               Iohn 11. 15..
2. Others hold that he wept for
Lazarus, not becauſe hee was dead, but
that for the glory of God, hee was to
raiſe him againe; and ſo bring him, from
reſt and happineſſe, to labour and miſery
               A loco requetis, ad locum laboris & miſeriae. Iſid. in Graec. Cat.
               .
And indeed, whereas there are but three
places of reſidence for Gods Elect: 1. the
Wombe: 2. the Earth: 3. Heauen. The
ſecond doth not ſo farre exceede the
firſt, in libertie and comfort; as the third
exceedeth the ſecond, in all true happineſſe;
as then, it were a miſerable thing
(if it could poſſibly be put in execution)
for a man to leaue the comfort of this

life, and be impriſoned in his mothers
wombe; ſo, a thouſand times more miſerable
were it for a ſoule to leaue the vnconceiueable
ioyes of heauen, and to be
impriſoned in the loathſome dungeon
of the body againe: and therefore little
did the Rich-man know what hee begged,
when hee would haue had Lazarus
to haue left Abrahams boſome, and to
haue gone to his Fathers houſe
               Luke 16. 27.. But I hold
it more probable, that as the godly
weepe for the death of others, abſolutely
conſidering it; whereas Circumſtances
conſidered they ſhould rather reioyce,
as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples,
being full of ſorrow to heare of his
death, If yee loued mee yee would rather
reioyce, becauſe I goe to the Father. So,

conſidering his deathMortem amìcì & ſibi chari, abſolutè conſiderauit, & lachrymatos eſt. Toll. in locum. annot. 10. col. 944., (wept for

euen to ſorrow and weepe for the death

did the Iſraelires bewayle the death of
that good Patriarke Iacob

weepe for that ſingular Prophet Moſes

(hee wept.)
            Thirdly, Chriſt fore-ſaw the miſerie
of the Iewes,
               
                  Fleuit propter Iudaeorū infidelitatem. Hill. in Pſal. 68. Epiph. in Anchorato. that they would be ſo farre
from belieuing this Miracle, and glorifying
God, that (as hereby more hardned)
they would ſeeke to kill him & Lazarus,

and therefore as at another time, hee
mourned for the hardneſſe of their hearts,
               Mat. 3. 5.
ſo now hee weepeth for it. (Ieſus wept.)
And this Circumſtance teacheth vs to
take to heart,Doct. and to mourne for the

yeelded riuers of water when hee ſaw men

Oh ſhall wee weepe to ſee a friend at the

is in them?

threatned, I will turne your Feasts into
mourning, and all your Songs into lamentation,
and I will bring ſackeloth on all loynes,

and baldneſſe vpon euery head, and I will
make it as the mourning of an onely Sonne,
and the end thereof as a bitter day
               Amos 8. 10..
            Now the ends of Chriſt his weeping
come to be conſidered (wherewith I wil
conclude) and they are principally theſe
two. viz. First,
               1. Doct. to ſhew vs the truth of
his humane nature, in that hee had not
onely the ſubſtance of ſoule and bodie,
with fleſh and bones, which a ſpirit hath
not
               Luk. 24. 39.; but alſo the infirmities of both, (ſo
farre as they were generall and blameleſſeM▪ 
                  Perk. on the Creed.)
as in the body, hanger

               Iohn 4. 6., &c. and in the ſoule, ſorrow

            Well did Simeon propheſie by the holy
Ghoſt, that Chriſt ſhould be for a ſigne
that ſhould be ſpoken againſt
               Luk. 2. 34., for euen in
the infancie of the Church, there did ariſe
