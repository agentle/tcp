            TO THE RIGHT VERTVOVS
AND WORTHY KNIGHT, SIR
THOMAS MOVNSON.
            
               SIR, the generall voice of your worthines,
and the manie particular fauours which I
haue heard Maſter Campion (with dutifull
reſpect often acknowledge himſelfe to haue
receiued from you) haue emboldned mee to
preſent this Booke of Ayres to your fauourable
iudgement, and gracious protection; eſpecially
becauſe the firſt ranke of ſongs are of
his owne compoſition, made at his vacant
houres, and priuately emparted to his friends, whereby they grew
both publicke, and (as coine crackt in exchange) corrupted: ſome
of them both words and notes vnreſpectiuely challenged by others.
In regard of which wronges, though his ſelfe neglects theſe light
fruits as ſuperfluous bloſſomes of his deeper Studies, yet hath it pleaſed
him vpon my entreaty, to grant me the impreſſion of part of
them, to which I haue added an equall number of mine owne. And
this two-faced Janus thus in one bodie vnited, I humbly entreate
you to entertaine and defend, chiefely in reſpect of the affection
which I ſuppoſe you beare him, who I am aſſured doth aboue all others
loue and honour you. And for my part, I shall thinke my ſelfe
happie if in anie ſeruice I may deſerue this fauour.
            
               Your Worſhips humbly deuoted,
PH

            TO THE READER.
            
               WHAT Epigrams are in Poetrie, the ſame are Ayres in muſicke, then
in their chiefe perfection when they are ſhort and well ſeaſoned. But
to clogg a light ſong with a long Praeludium, is to corrupt the nature
of it. Manie rests in Muſicke were inuented either for neceſſitie of
the fuge, or granted as a harmonicall licence in ſongs of many parts▪ but in Ayres I find no vſe they haue, vnleſſe it be to make a vulgar, and triuiall modulation
ſeeme to the ignorant ſtrange, and to the iudiciall tedious. A naked Ayre without guide,
or prop, or colour but his owne, is eaſily cenſured of euerie care, and requires ſo much the
more inuention to make it pleaſe. And as Martiall ſpeakes in defence of his ſhort Epigrams,
ſo may I ſay in th' apologie of Ayres, that where there is a full volume, there can be no imputation
of ſhortnes. The Lyricke Poets among the Greekes, and Latines were firſt inuenters
of Ayres, tying themſelues ſtrictly to the number, and value of their ſillables, of which ſort
you ſhall find here onely one ſong in Saphicke verſe, the reſt are after the faſcion of the time,
eare-pleaſing rimes without Arte. The ſubiect of them is for the moſt part amorous, and
why not amorous ſongs, as well as amorous attires? Or why not new Ayres, as well as new
faſcious? For the Note and Tabl
                  •
               ture, if they ſatiſfie the moſt, we haue our deſire, let expert
maſters pleaſe themſelues with better. And if anie light error hath eſcaped vs, the ſkilfull
may eaſily correct it, the vnſkilfull will hardly perceiue it. But there are ſome, who to
appeare the more deepe, and ſingular in their iudgement, will admit no Muſicke but that
which is long, intricate, bated with fuge, chaind with ſincopation, and where the nature of
euerie word is perciſely exprest in the Note, like the old exploided action in Comedies, when
it they did pronounce Memeni, they would point to the hinder part of their heads, if Video,
put their finger in their eye. But ſuch childiſh obſeruing of words is altogether ridiculous,
and we ought to maintaine as well in Notes, as in action a manly cariage, gracing no word,
but that which is eminent, and emphaticall. Neuertheles, as in Poeſie we giue the preheminence
to the Heroicall Poeme, ſo in Muſicke we yeeld the chiefe place to the graue, and well
inuented Motet, but not to euery harſh and dull confuſed Fantaſie, where in multitude of
points the Harmonie is quite drowned. Ayres haue both their Art and pleaſure, and I will
conclude of them as the Poet did in his cenſure, of Catullus the Lyricke, and Vergil the Heroicke
writer:
            
               Tantum magna ſuo debet Verona Catullo:
               Quantum parua ſuo Mantua Vergilio.
