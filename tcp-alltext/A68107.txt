               TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, RIGHT VVorſhipfull, and other my beloued Pariſhioners, Inhabitants of the Precinct of Black-friers LONDON, ſuch ſufficiencie of Grace as may bring them to fulneſſe of Glory.
            
               IF noble Birth, high Honour, great Eſtate, true Piety, bountifull Charity, good Eſteeme of Gods word and Miniſters, and in particular, intire loue of the Author, be inducements to chooſe a Patron for his worke, I, for my part, need not goe farre for a Patron. In mine owne pariſh are all theſe. To you therefore (right Honourable, right Worſhipfull, and other my beloued Pariſhioners, moſt worthy of all due reſpect) doe I dedicate theſe my poore paines about Domeſticall Duties. To teſtifie the equall dutie which I owe, and the impartiall reſpect which I beare to you all, I make you all as one Patron. You were the firſt ouer whom I euer had any miniſteriall charge. To this charge by your free choice was I called. Among you haue I ſpent Since Midſommer. 1608. almoſt two full prentiſhips. You haue alwaies ſo accepted my paines, and reſpected

my perſon, as I neuer had any cauſe to repent my acceptance of this place, and calling: but rather to thanke God for the ſame. My deſire is (if ſo it may ſeeme good to the diuine prouidence) to ſpend all my daies among you: and, while I am among you, to helpe forward your ſpirituall edification. This is the maine end of my calling, and the marke, which, as in the ordinary courſe of my Miniſtry, ſo in the publiſhing of theſe Eight Treatiſes of Domeſticall Duties, and dedicating them to you, I haue aimed at. As in teſtimony of Loue and Dutie I haue preached in your hearing, and publiſhed in your name theſe Duties, ſo doe you manifeſt your kinde acceptance of my former, and latter paines, by a conſcionable obſeruing of them, ſo farre forth as they are agreeable to Gods word: that all who know you, may know by that euident demonſtration, how well you haue reliſhed and approued them. Thus ſhall you gaine much profit, and my ſelfe much comfort by my paines. Oh if the head and ſeuerall members of a family would be perſwaded euery of them to be conſcionable in performing their owne particular duties, what a ſweet ſociety, and happy harmony would there be in houſes? What excellent ſeminaries would families be to Church and Commonwealth?

                Neceſſary it is that good order be firſt ſet in families: for as they were before other polities, ſo they are ſomewhat the more neceſſary: and good members of a family are like to make good members of Church and common-wealth. The ſubiect matter therefore of theſe Treatiſes is worth the handling, if I were able according to the worth thereof to handle it. I haue endeuoured to doe what I could therein, though I haue not attained to what I would. Be you like vnto God, who, if there be firſt a willing mind, accepteth according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. Though for ſuch a matter as is handled in theſe Treatiſes, the worke may ſeeme at firſt ſight to be too copious, yet I hope the obſeruant Reader

will not finde it too tedious. It is the variety of many, M

                not the prolixity of few points which hath made this booke to ſwell to that bigneſſe which it hath. The firſt Treatiſe (which is a fourth part of the booke) containeth a Commentary on that part of Scripture out of which Domeſticall Duties are raiſed: wherein the Apoſtle ſetting forth Chriſt and the Church as patternes to husbands and wiues, liuely declareth the great loue of Chriſt to his Church, and the neere vnion betwixt them, together with other deepe myſteries, the vnfolding whereof hath a little the longer detained me. But as I haue a while inſiſted on maine matters of much moment, ſo haue I very briefly paſſed ouer other points. The other Treatiſes, wherein the Duties themſelues are handled, are euery of them much ſhorter then the firſt. In them I haue barely propounded and briefly proued the truth and equity of the ſeuerall duties, except ſome choice points which are of eſpeciall vſe, or at leaſt through diſuſe much queſtioned: and them I haue more largely handled. And becauſe contraries laid together 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Ariſt. Rhet. lib. 3. cap. 2. doe much ſet forth each other in their liuely colours, I haue to euery duty annexed the contrary fault, and aberration from it. For many that heare the duties thinke all well enough, till they heare alſo the contrary vices, whereby in their conſciences they are moſt conuinced. Concerning the many faults and vices of bad Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Maſters and Seruants, taxed in theſe Treatiſes, let me intreat you, not to apply them too generally to all Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Maſters and Seruants. Hath not wiſe Solomon much taxed the lightneſſe, ſhrewiſhneſſe, pride, flattery, and other vices of women? And ſhall ſober, meeke, humble, honeſt women thinke themſelues taxed thereby? By like reaſon might vnchaſte ſtrumpets, vntruſty goſsips, vnquiet ſhrewes, and proud dames thinke themſelues commended by thoſe excellent commendations which be giueth of good women. Let euery

one, as their conſcience (an impartiall Iudge) ſhall beare them witneſſe, make a right application of euery thing to themſelues. Thus ſhall we Miniſters be freed from many euill ſurmizes. I remember that when theſe Domeſticall Duties were firſt vttered out of the pulpit, much exception was taken againſt the application of a wiues ſubiection to the reſtraining of her from diſpoſing the common goods of the family without, or againſt her husbands conſent. But ſurely they that made thoſe exceptions did not well thinke of the Cautions and Lamitations which were then deliuered, and are now againe expreſly noted: which are, that the foreſaid reſtraint be not extended to the 
                  Paraphernalia. Treat. 3. §. 21. 
               proper goods of a wife, no nor ouerſtrictly to ſuch Ibid. 
               goods as are ſet apart for the vſe of the family, nor to Treat. 3. §. 22. 
               extraordinary caſes, nor alwaies to an Treat. 3. §. 19. 
               expreſſe conſent, nor to the Treat. 3. §. 18. 
               conſent of ſuch husbands as are impotent, or farre and long abſent. If any other warrantable caution ſhall be ſhewed me, I will be as willing to admit it, as any of theſe. Now that my meaning may not ſtill be peruerted, I pray you, in reading the reſtraint of wiues power in diſpoſing the goods of the family, euer beare in minde thoſe Cautions. Other exceptions were made againſt ſome other particular duties of wiues. For many that can patiently enough heare their duties declared in generall termes, cannot endure to heare thoſe generals exemplified in their particular branches. This commeth too neere to the quicke, and pierceth too deepe. But (to interpret all, according to the rule of loue, in the better part) I take the maine reaſon of the many exceptions which were taken, to be this, that wiues duties (according to the Apoſtles method) being in the firſt place handled, there was taught (as muſt haue beene taught, except the truth ſhould haue beene betrayed) what a wife, in the vttermoſt extent of that ſubiection vnder which God hath put her, is bound vnto, in caſe her husband will ſtand vpon the

vttermoſt of his authority: which was ſo taken, as if I had taught that an husband might, and ought to exact the vttermoſt, and that a wife was bound in that vttermoſt extent to doe all that was deliuered as dutie, whether her husband exact it or no. But when I came to deliuer husbands duties, Treat. 4. §. 18. I ſhewed, that he ought not to exact whatſoeuer his wife was bound vnto (in caſe it were exacted by him) but that he ought to make her a ioynt Gouernour of the family with himſelfe, and referre the ordering of many things to her diſcretion, and with all honourable and kinde reſpect to carrie himſelfe towards her. In a word, I ſo ſet downe an husbands duties, as if he be wiſe and conſcionable in obſeruing them, his wife can haue no iuſt cauſe to complaine of her ſubiection. That which maketh a wiues yoake heauy and hard, is an husbands abuſe of his authority: and more preſsing his wiues dutie, then performing his owne: which is directly contrary to the 
                  Epheſ. 5. 33. See Treat. 1. §. 95. Apoſtles rule. This iuſt Apologie I haue beene forced to make, that I might not euer be iudged (as ſome haue cenſured me)

               an hater of women. Now that in all thoſe places where a wiues yoke may ſeeme moſt to pinch, I might giue ſome eaſe, I haue to euery head of wiues duties made a reference, in the margin ouer againſt it, to the duties of husbands anſwerable thereunto, and noted the reference with this marke *, that it might the more readily be turned vnto. Yea I haue further parallel'd, and laid euen one againſt another in one view, the heads of husbands and wiues duties, as they anſwer each other: and in like manner the contrary aberrations: with a reference made vnto the particular ſections where they are handled: that ſo on the one ſide it may appeare, that if both of them be conſcionable and carefull to performe their owne duty, the matrimoniall yoke will ſo equally lie on both their necks, as the wife will be no more pinched therewith then the husband, but that it will be like Chriſts ſpirituall yoke, light and eaſie: and that on the 
                  Mat. 11. 30.
               
other ſide it may be manifeſt that there is commonly as much failing by husbands in their duties, as by wiues in theirs. This parallel and euen-ſetting out of each of their duties, and of the contrary aberrations, I haue annexed next to this epiſtle. And further I haue added thereto a table of the ſeuerall heads of thoſe points that are handled in the eight following Treatiſes, that by this helpe you may the more readily finde out ſuch particular points as you deſire moſt eſpecially to read. To ſhew that the duties preſcribed to Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Maſters, and Seruants, are ſuch as in conſcience they are bound vnto, I haue endeuoured to ſhew how they are grounded on the word of God, and gathered from thence. To auoid prolixity, I haue referred moſt of the quotations to the margin. If your leiſure will ſerue you, you may doe well to ſearch them out. Two things haue beene eſpeciall helpes to me for finding out the many duties noted in theſe Treatiſes, & vices contrary thereunto: Obſeruation and Diſpoſition. Obſeruation both of ſuch duties as the Scripture commendeth and contrary vices as it condemneth: and alſo of ſuch commendable virtues as I well liked in thoſe Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Maſters, and Seruants, that I came among, and ſuch vnſeemely vices as I diſliked in them: and Diſpoſition of one point after another in the beſt order that I could. My method and manner of proceeding brought many things to my minde, which otherwiſe might haue ſlipped by. For by method ſundry and ſeuerall points appertaining to one matter are drawne forth, as in a chaine one linke draweth vp another. There is no better way to finde out many obſeruations in a text, then by a methodicall reſolution thereof. As method is an helpe to Inuention, ſo alſo to retention. It is as the thread or wier whereon pearles are put, which keepeth them from ſcattering. And if a man by abundance of matter be caſt into a labyrinth, by the helpe of method he may eaſily and readily finde

out the way againe. In which reſpects method is fitly ſtiled the Methodusintelligentiae parens eſt, & magiſtra memoriae.

                them, as I did in inuenting and diſpoſing them.
            Becauſe there is not one word to compriſe vnder it both maſters and miſtreſſes, as fathers and mothers are compriſed vnder Parents, and ſonnes and daughters vnder Children, I haue according to the Scripture phraſe compriſed Miſtreſſes vnder Maſters: ſo as the duties enioyned to them belong to theſe, ſo farre as may ſtand with their ſex. To conclude, in recompence of all my paines I heartily pray you all to pray heartily for him who daily praieth for you, euen Church-court in Black-Fryers London. 2.

               EPHES. 5. 21.
               Submit your ſelues one to another in the feare of God.
            
            
               §. 1. Of the Apoſtles tranſition from generall duties to particulars.
               
               
                  AS there are two vocations whereunto it hath pleaſed God to call euery one; one Generall, by vertue whereof certaine common duties which are to be performed of all men, are required, (as knowledge, faith, obedience, repentance, loue, mercie, iuſtice, truth, &c.) the other Particular, by vertue whereof certaine peculiar duties are required of ſeuerall perſons, according to thoſe diſtinct places wherein the Diuine Prouidence hath ſet them in Common-wealth, Church, or family; ſo ought Gods Miniſters to be carefull in inſtructing

Gods people in both kindes of duties; both thoſe which concerne their generall, and thoſe alſo which concerne their particular calling. Accordingly S. Paul (who, as 
                     Num. 12. 7. 
                  Moſes, was faithfull in all the houſe of God) after he had ſufficiently inſtructed Gods Church in ſuch generall duties, as belong to all Chriſtians, of what ſex, ſtate, degree, or condition ſoeuer they be, proceedeth to lay downe certaine particular duties, which appertaine to particular callings and conditions: among which, he maketh choiſe of thoſe which God hath eſtabliſhed in a family. With excellent Art doth he paſſe from thoſe generals, to theſe particulars: laying downe a tranſition betwixt them, in theſe words, Submitting your ſelues one to another in the feare of God; which words haue reference both to that which goeth before, and alſo to that which followeth after. The forme and manner of ſetting downe this verſe, with a participle thus, ſubmitting, ſheweth that it dependeth on that which went before, and ſo hath reference thereunto. Againe, the word it ſelfe being the very ſame which is vſed 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , ſubmitting. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , ſubmit. in the next verſe following, ſheweth, that this verſe containeth the ſumme of that which followeth, and ſo hath reference thereunto, as a generall vnto particulars. This manner of paſſing from one point to another, by a perfect tranſition which looketh both wayes, both to that which is paſt, and to that which commeth on, as it is very elegant, ſo is it frequent with this our Apoſtle. Whereby he teacheth vs, Note. ſo to giue heed to that which followeth, as we forget not that which is paſt: as we muſt giue diligent attention to that which remaineth, ſo we muſt well retaine that which we haue heard, and not let it ſlip: otherwiſe, if (as one naile driueth out another) one precept maketh another to be forgotten, it will be altogether in vaine to adde line vnto line, or precept vnto precept.
            
            
               §. 2. Of ioyning ſeruice to men with our praiſing of God.
               
               As this verſe hath reference to that which was deliuered before, concerning our dutie to God, it teacheth vs this leſſon:
               
                  
                  It is the dutie of Chriſtians as to ſet forth the praiſe of God, ſo to be ſeruiceable one to another. For this purpoſe in the Doct. Decalogue to the firſt table, which preſcribeth that duty which we owe to God, is added the ſecond table, which declareth the ſeruice that we owe one to another: and he that ſaid, 
                     Matt. 22. 38, 39. 
                  The firſt and great Commandement is this, Thou ſhalt loue the Lord, &c. ſaid alſo, The ſecond is like to this, Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour, &c. whereupon the 
                     Heb. 13. 15, 16. Apoſtle declaring what thoſe ſacrifices be wherewith God is well pleaſed, ioyneth theſe two together, to giue thankes to God, and to doe good to man. The ſeruice which in the feare of God we performe one to another, is an euident and reall demonſtration of the reſpect we beare vnto God. 
                     Pſal. 16. 2. 
                  To God our goodneſſe extendeth not. 
                  
                     Iob 22. 3. & 35. 7. He is ſo high aboue vs, ſo perfect and compleat in himſelfe, that neither can we giue to him, nor he receiue of vs. But in his owne ſtead he hath placed our brother like to our ſelues; to whom, 
                     Iob 35. 8. as we may doe hurt, ſo by our faithfull ſeruice we may doe much 
                     Pſal. 16. 3. good: in doing whereof God is much honoured.
               This diſcouereth their hypocriſie, who make great pretence 1. Vſe. A note of hypocriſie. of praiſing God, and yet are ſcornfull, and diſdainfull to their brethren, and ſlothfull to doe any ſeruice to man: Theſe mens religion is vaine. By this note did the Prophets 
                     Iam. 1. 26. Iſa. 58. 3 &c. Mic. 6. 6. &c. Matt. 23. 14. 1 Ioh. 4. 20. in their time, and Chriſt and his Apoſtles in their time alſo, diſcouer the hypocriſie of thoſe among whom they liued: and ſo may we alſo in our times. For many there be, who frequently in their houſes, and in the middeſt of the Congregation ſing praiſe vnto God, and performe other parts of Gods outward worſhip, but towards one another, are proud, ſtout, enuious, vnmercifull, vniuſt, ſlanderous, and very backward to doe any good ſeruice. Surely, that outward ſeruice which they pretend to performe to God, doth not ſo much wipe out the ſpot of prophaneſſe, as their neglect of dutie vnto man brandeth their foreheads with the ſtampe of hypocriſie. 2. Vſe. Put not off one dutie with another. Matt. 23. 23.
               
               For our parts, let vs not vpon pretext of one dutie, though it may ſeeme to be the waightier, thinke to ſhift off another; leſt that fearefull woe which Chriſt denounced

againſt the Scribes and Phariſies fall vpon our pates. As God is carefull to inſtruct vs how to carrie our ſelues both to his owne Maieſtie, and alſo one to another, ſo let vs in both approue our ſelues to him: remembring what Chriſt ſaid to the Phariſies, Theſe ought ye to haue done, and not to leaue the other vndone. The ſame Lord that requireth praiſe to his owne Maieſtie, inioyneth mutuall ſeruice one to another; the neglect of this, as well as of that, ſheweth too light reſpect of his will and pleaſure: What therefore God 
                  
                     Matth. 19. 6. 
                  hath ioyned together, let not man put aſunder.
               
            
            
               §. 3. Of euery ones ſubmitting himſelfe to another.
               
               Againe, as this verſe hath reference to that which followeth, it declareth the generall ſumme of all, which is mutually to ſubmit our ſelues one to another in the feare of God. The parts hereof are two:

                     1. An Exhortation.
                     2. A Direction.
                  
               
               In the exhortation is noted, both the dutie it ſelfe in this word ſubmit, and alſo the parties to whom it is to be performed, one to another.
               
               Both branches of the exhortation, viz. the dutie, and the parties ioyned together, afford this doctrine, that
               
                  It is a generall mutuall dutie appertaining to all Chriſtians, 
                  2. Doct.
                   
                  to ſubmit themſelues one to another: For this precept is as generall as any of the former, belonging to all ſorts and degrees whatſoeuer: and ſo much doth this word one another 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . imply: in which extent the Apoſtle in another place exhorteth to ſerue one another: and againe, euery man to ſeeke 
                  
                     Gal. 5. 13. 1 Cor. 10. 24. 
                  anothers wealth.
               
               Concerning inferiours, it is without queſtion cleare, that Queſt. they ought to ſubmit themſelues to their ſuperiours: yea, concerning equals no great queſtion can be made, but they in giuing honour muſt goe one before another, and ſo ſubmit 
                     Rom. 12. 10. How ſuperiours ought to ſubiect themſelues. themſelues: but concerning ſuperiours, iuſt queſtion may be made, whether it be a dutie required of them to ſubmit themſelues to their inferiours.
               
                  
To reſolue this doubt, we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh betwixt Anſw. ſubiection of reuerence, and ſubiection of ſeruice.
               
               
                  Subiection of reuerence is that whereby one teſtifieth an eminencie and ſuperioritie in them whom he reuerenceth, and that in ſpeech, by giuing them titles of honour; or in geſture, by ſome kinde of obeyſance; or in action, by a ready obeying of their commandement. This is proper to inferiours.
               
                  Subiection of ſeruice is that whereby one in his place is Difference betwixt ſubiection of Reuerence and Seruice.
                   ready to doe what good he can to another. This is common to all Chriſtians: a dutie which euen ſuperiours owe to inferiours, according to the fore-named extent of this word one another: in which reſpect euen the higheſt gouernour on earth is called a miniſter, for the good of ſuch as 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Rom. 13. 4. are vnder him.
               Secondly, we muſt put difference betwixt the worke it Difference betwixt the worke and manner of doing it. ſelfe, and the manner of doing it. That worke which in it ſelfe is a worke of ſuperioritie and authoritie, in the manner of doing it may be a worke of ſubmiſſion, viz. if it be done in humilitie and meekneſſe of minde. The Magiſtrate by ruling with meekneſſe and humilitie, ſubmitteth himſelfe to his ſubiect. In this reſpect the Apoſtle exhorteth that nothing (no not the higheſt and greateſt workes that 
                     Phil. 2. 3. can be) be done in vaine-glory, but in meekneſſe.
               
               Thirdly, we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the ſeuerall places wherein men are: for euen they who are ſuperiours to ſome, Euery one vnder ſome authoritie. Matth. 8. 9. are inferiours to others: as he that ſaid, I haue vnder me, and am vnder authoritie. The maſter that hath ſeruants vnder him, may be vnder the authoritie of a Magiſtrate. Yea, God hath ſo diſpoſed euery ones ſeuerall place, as there is not any one, but in ſome reſpect is vnder another. The wife, though a mother of children, is vnder her husband. The husband, though head of a family, is vnder publike Magiſtrates. Publike Magiſtrates one vnder another, and all vnder the King. The King himſelfe vnder God and his word deliuered by his Ambaſſadours, whereunto the higheſt are to ſubmit themſelues. And Miniſters of the word, as ſubiects, are vnder their Kings and Gouernours.

He that ſaith, Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers, 
                  
                     Rom. 13. 1. excepteth not Miniſters of the word: and he that ſaith, obey them that haue the ouerſight of you, and ſubmit your ſelues, 
                  
                     Heb. 13. 17. Difference betwixt Magiſtrates and Miniſters authoritie. excepteth not kings: only the difference is in this, that the authoritie of the king is in himſelfe, and in his owne name he may command obedience to be performed to himſelfe: but the authoritie of a Miniſter is in Chriſt, and in Chriſts name only may he require obedience to be performed to Chriſt.
               The reaſon why all are bound to ſubmit themſelues one 
                     Reaſon. Euery ones Office for the good of another. to another is, becauſe euery one is ſet in his place by God, not ſo much for himſelfe, as for the good of others: whereupon the Apoſtle exhorteth, that none ſeeke his owne, but euery man anothers wealth. Euen Gouernours are aduanced 1 Cor. 10. 24. to places of dignitie and authoritie, rather for the good of their ſubiects then for their owne honour. Their callings are in truth offices of ſeruice, yea burdens vnder which they muſt willingly put their ſhoulders, being called of God, and of which they are to giue an account concerning the good which they haue done to others: for the effecting whereof, it is needfull that they ſubmit themſelues.
               Let euery one therefore high and low, rich and poore, 1. Vſe. Exhòrtation vnto all to doe ſeruice. ſuperiour and inferiour, Magiſtrate and ſubiect, Miniſter and people, husband and wife, parent and childe, maſter and ſeruant, neighbours and fellowes, all of all ſorts in their ſeuerall places take notice of their dutie in this point of ſubmiſſion, and make conſcience to put it in practice: Magiſtrates, by procuring the wealth and peace of their people, as Mordecai: Miniſters, by making themſelues ſeruants 
                     Eſt. 10. 3. vnto their people, not ſeeking their owne profit, but the 1 Cor. 9. 19. & 10. 33. profit of many, that they may be ſaued, as Paul: Fathers, by well educating their children, and taking heed that they prouoke them not to wrath, as Dauid: Husbands, 
                  
                     Prou. 4. 3, 4. by dwelling with their wiues according to knowledge; giuing honour to the wife as to the weaker veſſell, as Abraham: 
                  
                     Gen. 16. 6. 
                  Maſters, by doing that which is iuſt and equall to their ſeruants, as the Centurion: Euery one, by being of like 
                     Luke 7. 2. affection one towards another, and by ſeruing one another

in loue, according to the Apoſtles rule. Let this dutie of 
                     Rom. 12. 16. Gal. 5. 13. ſubmiſſion be firſt well learned, and then all other duties will better be performed.
               Be not high minded, nor ſwell one againſt another. 2. Vſe. Dehortation from ſwelling one againſt another. Though in outward eſtate ſome may be higher than other, yet in Chriſt all are one whether bond or free: all members of one and the ſame body. Now conſider the mutuall affection (as I may ſo ſpeake) of the members of a naturall body one towards another: not any one of them will puffe it ſelfe vp, 
                     Gal. 3. 28. and riſe againſt the other: the head which is the higheſt 1 Cor. 12. 27. and of greateſt honour will ſubmit it ſelfe to the feet in performing the dutie of an head, as well as the feet to the head in performing their dutie; ſo all other parts. Neither is it hereby implied that they which are in place of dignitie and authoritie ſhould forget or relinquiſh their place, dignitie, or authoritie, and become as inferiours vnder authoritie, no more than the head doth: for the head in ſubmitting it ſelfe doth not goe vpon the ground and beare the body, as the feet; but it ſubmitteth it ſelfe by directing and gouerning the other parts, and that with all the humilitie, meekneſſe, and gentleneſſe that it can. So muſt all ſuperiours: much more muſt equals and inferiours learne with humilitie, and meekneſſe, without ſcorne or diſdaine, to performe their dutie: this is that which was before by the Apoſtle 
                     Epheſ. 4. 2. expreſly mentioned, and is here againe intimated; none are exempted and priuileged from it. We know that it is vnnaturall, and vnbeſeeming the head to ſcorne the feet, and to ſwell againſt them, but more than monſtrous for one hand to ſcorn another: what ſhall we then ſay if the feet ſwel againſt the head? Surely ſuch ſcorne and diſdaine among the members, would cauſe not only great diſturbance, but alſo vtter ruine to the body. And can it be otherwiſe in a politique body? But on the contrarie, when all of all ſorts ſhall (as hath beene before ſhewed) willingly ſubmit themſelues one to another, the whole body, and euery member thereof will reape good thereby: yea, by this mutuall ſubmiſſion, as we doe good, ſo we ſhall receiue good.
            
            
               
               §. 4. Of the feare of God.
               
               Hitherto of the exhortation. The direction followeth. In the feare of the Lord. This clauſe is added, to declare partly the meanes, how men may be brought to ſubmit themſelues readily one to another: and partly the manner, how they ought to ſubmit themſelues. The feare of the Lord is both the efficient cauſe that moueth a true Chriſtian willingly to performe all dutie to man, and alſo the end whereunto he referreth euery thing that he doth. For the better conceiuing whereof, I will briefly declare

                     1. What this feare of the Lord is.
                     2. How the Lord is the proper obiect of it.
                     3. What is the extent thereof.
                     4. Why it is ſo much vrged.
                  
               
               First, feare of God is an awfull reſpect of the diuine Maieſtie. 1. What the feare of God is. The cauſes of it. Sometimes it ariſeth from faith in the mercy and goodneſſe of God: for when the heart of man hath once felt a ſweet taſte of Gods goodneſſe, and found that in his fauour only all happineſſe conſiſteth, it is ſtrucken with ſuch an inward awe and reuerence, as it would not for any thing diſpleaſe Two effects of a filiall feare of God. his Maieſtie, but rather doe whatſoeuer it may know to be pleaſing and acceptable vnto him. For theſe are two effects which ariſe from this kinde of feare of God:
               1. A carefull endeuour to pleaſe God, in which reſpect 
                     Deum timere eſt nulla mala facere, & nulla bona quae faci enda ſunt praete rire. Bernar. de modo benè viuen. ſer. 4. good king Iehoſaphat hauing exhorted his Iudges to execute the iudgement of the Lord aright, addeth this clauſe as a motiue thereunto, Let the feare of the Lord be vpon you: implying thereby that Gods feare would make them endeuour to approue themſelues to God.
               2. A carefull auoiding of ſuch things as offend the Maieſty of God, and grieue his ſpirit: in which reſpect the Wiſeman 2 Chro. 19. 6, 7. ſaith, The feare of the Lord is to hate euill: and of Iob it is 
                     Prou. 8. 13. ſaid that he fearing God departed from euill. 
                  
                     Job. 1. 1.
               
               Sometimes againe, awe and dread of the diuine Maieſtie ariſeth from diffidence: For when a mans heart doubteth of Gods mercy, and expecteth nothing but vengeance, the very thought of God ſtriketh an awe or rather dread into him, and ſo maketh him feare God.
               
                  
From this double cauſe of feare, whereof one is contrary Difference betwixt filiall and ſeruile feare. to another, hath ariſen that vſuall diſtinction of a filiall or ſonne-like feare, and a ſeruile or ſlauiſh feare: which diſtinction is grounded on theſe words of the Apoſtle, ye haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage againe to feare (this is Bernard. loc. citat. a ſeruile feare) but ye haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption 
                  
                     Rom. 8. 15. 
                  whereby we cry, Abba, father: this cauſeth a filiall feare. The filiall feare is ſuch a feare as dutifull children beare to their fathers. But the ſeruile feare is ſuch an one as bondſlaues beare to their maſters. A ſonne feareth ſimply to offend or diſpleaſe his father: ſo as 
                     Eſt timor ne amittatur gratia beneficij. Hic timor caſt us eſt, non eum charitas eijcit, ſed aſciſcit. Auguſt. epiſt. 120. it is accompanied with loue. A bondſlaue feareth nothing but the puniſhment of his offence; ſo as it is ioyned with hatred: and ſuch an one feareth not to ſinne, but to burne in hell for ſinne. Faithfull Abraham like a gratious childe feared God (as Gods Angell beareth witneſſe, Gen. 22. 12.) when he was ready rather to ſacrifice his only ſonne, then offend God by refuſing to 
                     Qui gehennas metuit, non peccare metuit ſed ardere. Aug. epiſt. 144. obey his commandement. But faithleſſe Adam like a ſeruile bondſlaue feared God (as he himſelfe teſtifieth againſt himſelfe Gen. 3 10.) when after he had broken Gods commandement, he hid himſelfe from the preſence of God. This ſlauiſh feare is a plaine diabolicall feare (for the deuils 
                  
                     Jam. 2. 19. ſo feare as they tremble:) It maketh men wiſh there were no hell, no day of Iudgement, no Iudge, yea no God. This is that feare without which we muſt ſerue the Lord. In this 
                     Luke 1. 74. feare to ſubmit ones ſelfe is nothing acceptable to God: It is therefore the filiall feare which is here meant.
               Secondly, of this feare God is the proper obiect, as by 2. How God is the proper obiect of feare. this and many more teſtimonies of Scripture is euident, where the feare of God and of the Lord is mentioned. This feare hath ſo proper a relation vnto God, as the Scripture ſtileth God by a kinde of proprietie, with this title Feare: for where Iaakob mentioneth the feare of Iſaak, he meaneth 
                     Gen. 31. 42, 53. the Lord whom Iſaak feared.
               It is then vnlawfull to feare any but God? Quest.
               
               No: Men alſo may be feared, as Princes, Parents, Maſters, 
                     Ans. How men are to be feared. and other ſuperiours; For the Apoſtle exhorting to giue euery one their due, giueth this inſtance, feare, 
                  
                     Rom. 13. 7.
                  
                  to whom feare is due. But yet may God notwithſtanding be ſaid to be the proper obiect of feare, becauſe all the feare that any way is due to any creature, is due to him in and for the Lord whoſe image he carrieth: ſo as in truth it is not ſo much the perſon of a man, as the image of God placed in him, by vertue of ſome authoritie or dignitie appertaining to him, which is to be feared. If there ſhould fall out any ſuch oppoſition betwixt God and man, as in fearing man our feare would be withdrawne from God, then the rule of Chriſt is to take place, which is this, feare not them which 
                  
                     Matth. 10. 28. 
                  kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule: but rather feare him which is able to deſtroy both ſoule and body in hell.
               
               Thirdly, the extent of this true filiall feare of God is 3. Euery dutie to be ſeaſoned with a feare of God. very large. No one point throughout the whole Scripture is more vrged than this feare of the Lord. It is oft added to other duties, as that whereby they are ſeaſoned, and without which they cannot well be performed: wherefore we are commanded to ſerue the Lord in feare, to perfect holineſſe 
                  
                     Pſal. 2. 11. 
                  in the feare of God, to worke out our ſaluation with feare: and 2 Cor. 7. 1. the Churches are commended for walking in the feare of the 
                  
                     Phil. 2. 12. 
                  
                     Acts 9. 31. 
                  Lord: ſo likewiſe particular men as a Gen. 22. 12. 
                  Abram, 
                  b & 42. 18. 
                  Ioſeph, 
                  c Iob 1. 1. 
                  Iob, and many other: yea the whole worſhip of God is oft compriſed vnder this branch of feare: whereupon our Sauiour Chriſt alleaging this text, thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God, 
                  
                     Deut. 6. 13. thus expreſſeth it, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God. And 
                     Matth. 4. 10. againe where the Lord by his Prophet Iſay ſaith, Their feare 
                  
                     Iſa. 29. 13. 
                  toward me is taught by the precept of men, Chriſt thus quoteth that text, In vaine doe they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines 
                  
                     Matth. 15. 9. 
                  the commandements of men: out of which places compared together, it is euident, that vnder the feare of God, is compriſed the worſhip of God. Yea, all that dutie which we owe to God and man is compriſed vnder this title, the feare of God: for Dauid when he would in one word declare the ſumme and ſubſtance of all that which a Miniſter ought to teach his people, ſaith, I will teach you the feare of 
                  
                     Pſal. 34. 11. 
                  the Lord. 
                  4. Why a feare of God is ſo much vrged.
               
               Fourthly, The reaſon why the Holy Ghoſt ſo much vrgeth the feare of God, and that in ſo large an extent as hath

beene ſhewed, I take to be this; to ſhew a difference betwixt that integritie and perfection of Gods image which was at mans creation firſt planted in him, and the renouation thereof while here he liueth in this world. So compleat and perfect was then Gods image in man, as he needed no other motiue to prouoke him to any dutie but loue. Wherefore when the Holy Ghoſt would ſet forth that perfection of Gods image firſt planted in man, he addeth this title Loue vnto other duties, whether they concerne God or man. Concerning God, Moſes exhorteth Iſrael to loue the 
                  
                     Deut. 11. 13. 
                  Lord and ſerue him: and againe, to loue the Lord, to walke in 
                  
                     Deut. 30. 16. 
                  his waies, to keepe his commandements, &c. Concerning man, the Apoſtle exhorteth to ſerue one another by loue: and to doe 
                  
                     Gal. 5. 13. 
                  all things in loue. Yea, ſometimes the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed 1 Cor. 16. 14. to compriſe all duties vnder loue: In which reſpect Chriſt calleth this commandement (Thou ſhalt loue the Lord) the 
                  
                     Matth. 22. 38. 
                  great commandement, which compriſeth all the commandements of the firſt table vnder it: and for the ſecond table, S. Paul ſaith, that loue is the fulfilling of the law. But by Adams 
                  
                     Rom. 13. 10. fall, and the corruption which thereby infected mans nature, the loue of God hath waxed cold in man, and though the Saints be created againe according to that image of God, yet while in this world they liue, that image is not ſo perfect as it was, the fleſh remaineth in the beſt: in which reſpect God hath faſt fixed this affection of feare in mans heart, and thereby both reſtraineth him from ſinne, and alſo prouoketh him vnto euery good dutie.
            
            
               §. 5. Of the feare of God mouing vs to doe ſeruice to men.
               
               Hauing briefly declared the nature, obiect, extent, and vſe of feare, I returne to the point in hand, viz. to ſhew 1. how it is here laid downe as a motiue to ſtirre vp men to performe the dutie here required: for by this clauſe, in the feare of the Lord, the Apoſtle implieth that
               
                  It is the feare of God which moueth men conſcionably to ſubmit 
                  Doct. 
                  themſelues one to another. This made 2. Sam. 23. 3. 
                  Dauid ſo well to rule the people of God: and 
                     Gen. 42. 18. 
                  Ioſeph to deale ſo well with

his brethren: yea, 
                     Iſa. 11. 2, 3. this is noted to be the cauſe of the righteous regiment of Chriſt himſelfe. Well did that good King Iehoſaphat know this, and therefore when he appointed Iudges ouer his people, as a motiue to ſtirre them vp to execute the iudgements of the Lord aright, he ſaith vnto them, Let the feare of the Lord be vpon you. So alſo S. Peter, 
                  2 Chron. 19. 7. to moue ſubiects to honour their King, prefixeth this exhortation, Feare God. 
                  1 Pet. 2. 17.
               
               By feare of man, may one be brought to ſubmit himſelfe Obiect. to another: as a magiſtrate may be moued to deale iuſtly and mildly with his people through feare of inſurrections and rebellions: ſubiects may by ſeuere lawes and tyrannie be brought to ſubmit themſelues: and ſo other inferiours alſo by threats, by hard vſage, and other by-reſpects.
               1. Though feare of man be a motiue, yet it followeth Anſw. not, that therefore feare of God ſhould be no motiue: it may be another motiue, and a better motiue.
               2. The ſubmiſſion which is performed through feare of Difference betwixt doing a thing for feare of God and feare of man. man is a forced and a ſlauiſh ſubmiſſion, nothing acceptable to God: but that which is performed through a true filiall feare of God, is a free, willing, ready, cheerefull, conſcionable ſubmiſſion: ſuch a ſubmiſſion as will ſtirre vs vp to doe the beſt good we can thereby vnto them, to whom we ſubmit our ſelues, and ſo is more acceptable to God, by reaſon of the cauſe thereof, and more profitable vnto man, by reaſon of the effect and fruit thereof.
               For a true feare of God maketh vs more reſpect what 
                     Reaſon. The power of a feare of God. God requireth and commandeth, than what our corrupt heart deſireth and ſuggeſteth: It ſubdueth our vnruly paſſions, and bringeth them within compaſſe of dutie: It maketh vs deny our ſelues and our owne deſires: and though through the corruption of our nature and inborne pride we be loth to ſubmit, yet will Gods feare bring downe that proud minde, and make vs humble and gentle. It will keepe thoſe who are in authoritie from tyranny, crueltie, and ouer-much ſeueritie: and it will keepe thoſe who are vnder ſubiection from diſſimulation, deceit, and priuie conſpiracies.
               
                  
Behold how neceſſarie it is, that a true feare of the Lord 
                     Vſe. The neceſſitie of a feare of God. be planted in mens hearts, in the hearts of Kings and all Gouernours, in the hearts of ſubiects and all people, whether ſuperiours or inferiours. Where no feare of God is, there will be no good ſubmiſſion vnto man. Abraham 
                  
                     Gen. 20. 11. thought that the men of Gerar would haue no reſpect to him or his wife, nor make conſcience of common honeſtie, nor abſtaine from innocent bloud, becauſe he ſaw no feare of God in that place: and the Apoſtle hauing reckoned vp 
                     Rom. 3. 11, &c.
                   many notorious effects of mans naturall corruption, concludeth all with this, as the cauſe of all, There is no feare of God before their eyes. Wherefore let Magiſtrates, Parents, Maſters, and all in authoritie, haue eſpeciall care that their ſubiects, children, ſeruants, and all vnder them may be taught and brought to feare the Lord. I dare auouch it, that ſuch inferiours which are taught to feare God, will doe better ſeruiee to their ſuperiours, than ſuch as feare their ſuperiours only as men, and feare not God. Let Miniſters eſpecially vrge and preſſe vpon the conſciences of men a feare of God. Let all inferiours pray that the feare of the Lord may be planted in the hearts of their ſuperiours, that ſo they may liue a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſtie vnder them. Happie is that kingdome where Magiſtrates and ſubiects feare the Lord. Happie is that Church where Miniſters and people feare the Lord. Happie is that family where husband and wife, parents and children, maſter and ſeruants feare the Lord. In ſuch a Kingdome, Church, and family, will euery one, to the mutuall good one of another, ſubmit themſelues one to another. But if ſuch as feare not God ſubmit themſelues, whether they be ſuperiours or inferiours, it is for their owne ends and aduantages, and not for their good to whom they ſubmit themſelues.
            
            
               §. 6. Of limiting all dutie to man, within the compaſſe of the feare of God.
               
               Againe, as this clauſe (In the feare of the Lord) declareth the manner of ſubmiſſion, it ſheweth, that
               
                  
                  No ſubmiſſion is to be performed vnto man, but that which 
                  Doct. 
                  may ſtand with the feare of God. Whereby we ſhew that we haue reſpect to God, and labour aboue all to approue our ſelues to him. Thus Dauid is commanded to rule in the 
                  2 Sam. 23. 3. 
                  feare of God: and other Magiſtrates to performe their dutie 2 Chro. 19 9. 
                  in the feare of the Lord: which Nehemiah that good Gouernour 
                     Neh. 5. 15. was carefull to doe. So alſo ſubiects are to obey in the feare of the Lord, which the Apoſtle implieth by prefixing 1 Pet. 2. 17. this precept, Feare God, before that, Honour the King; as if he had ſaid, ſo honour the King, as in and thereby you may manifeſt your feare of God: let not this latter croſſe the former. Seruants likewiſe are commanded to be obedient vnto their Maſters with this prouiſo, fearing the Lord. Such 
                     Coloſſ. 3. 22. phraſes as theſe, For the Lords ſake, As vnto the Lord, In the 
                  1 Pet. 2. 13. 
                  Lord, As ſeruants of Chriſt, with the like, being annexed to 
                     Eph. 5. 22. & 6. 1, 6. the duties of inferiours, doe imply as much.
               Great reaſon there is that all ſeruice ſhould be limited 1. Reaſon. God the higheſt Lord. with the feare of God: for God is the higheſt Lord to whom all ſeruice primarily and principally is due: whatſoeuer ſeruice is due to any man, high or low, is due in and for the Lord. The Lord hath ſet ſuperiours in the places of eminencie, wherein they beare the image of God. The Lord alſo hath ſet inferiours in their places, and commended them as his charge to the gouernment of thoſe who are ouer them. He that obeyeth not thoſe who are ouer him in the feare of God, ſheweth no reſpect of Gods image: and he who gouerneth not thoſe who are vnder him in the feare of God, ſheweth no reſpect of Gods charge.
               Beſides, God is that great Iudge to whom all of all ſorts, 2. Reaſon. God the Iudge of all. ſuperiours and inferiours are to giue an account of their ſeruice. Though by our ſeruice we haue neuer ſo well approued our ſelues to men, yet if we haue not therein had reſpect vnto God, and approued our ſelues to him, with what face may we appeare before his dreadfull iudgement ſeat? 1. Vſe. The folly of all thoſe who feare man more than God. Can the fauour of thoſe whom we haue pleaſed in this world, protect and ſhelter vs from the fury of Gods diſpleaſure?
               Behold the folly of ſuch Gouernours as wholly apply

themſelues to the fancie of their people, yea though it be againſt the Lord and his word. This was Adams folly, who 
                     Gen. 3. 6. at his wiues motion did eat of the forbidden fruit. This was Aarons folly, who to pleaſe the people, erected an 
                     Exod. 32. 1. Idoll. And this was Sauls folly, who againſt Gods expreſſe 1 Sam. 15. 21. prohibition ſuffered his people to take ſome of the ſpoile of the Amalekites. The like may be ſaid of Ioaſh, who 2 Chro. 24 7. hearkned to his Princes to ſet vp Idols: and of Pilate, who 
                     Marke 15. 15. to pleaſe the people, againſt his conſcience, deliuered Chriſt to be crucified. The fearefull iſſue of this their ſubmiſſion, not ſeaſoned with a feare of God, but contrary thereunto, may be a warning to all ſuperiours, to take heed how they ſeeke to pleaſe them that are vnder them, more than God who is aboue them. The iſſue of Adams, Aarons, Sauls, and Ioaſh his baſe ſubmiſſion, is noted by the Holy Ghoſt in their ſeuerall hiſtories. Of Pilate it is recorded, that being 
                     Euſcb. hiſt. Eccl. lib 2. cap. 7. brought into extreme neceſſitie, he laid violent hands vpon himſelfe.
               Neither is it to be accounted folly only in ſuperiours to ſubmit themſelues to their inferiours againſt the Lord, but alſo in inferiours to their ſuperiours: for thereby they ſhew that they feare man more than God, which Chriſt expreſly

                   to fetch Eliah, obeyed their king therein; but what got they thereby? was the king able to ſaue them from the fire which God ſent downe from heauen vpon them? The women 
                     Ier. 44. 19. reproued for offering incenſe to the Queene of heauen, did it not without their husbands, yet were they not excuſed thereby. The children and others in the familie

Wherefore let all of all ſorts ſet the feare of God as a marke before them to aime at in all their actions. Let ſuperiours 
                     Numb. 11. 29. neither doe any thing to giue content to their inferiours: 1 Sam. 24. 8. & 26. 9. nor ſuffer any thing to be done for their ſakes by their inferiours, which cannot ſtand with the feare of God. And let inferiours

               FRom that generall direction concerning mutuall ſubmiſſion, the Apoſtle commeth to certaine particulars, by which he exemplifieth the ſame: and teacheth vs, that
               
                  It is not ſufficient to performe generall duties of Chriſtianitie, 
                  Doct. 
                  vnleſſe alſo we be conſcionable in performing the particular duties of our ſeuerall callings. A conſcionable performance of thoſe particular duties is one part of our 
                     Eph. 4. 1. 
                  walking worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called: and therefore the Apoſtle, for illuſtration and exemplification thereof, doth reckon vp ſundry particulars, both in this and 
                     Col. 3. 18, &c. 1 Cor. 7. 1 Tim. 3. other Epiſtles: and ſo doe 1 Pet. 2. & 3. other Apoſtles. And

               Hereby much credit is brought to our profeſſion, and the

                  doctrine of God our Sauiour is adorned. And much good is hereby both mutually communicated one to another, and receiued one from another: for our particular places and callings are thoſe bonds whereby perſons are firmely and fitly knit together, as the members of a naturall body by nerues, arteries, ſinewes, veines, and the like, by which life, ſenſe and motion is communicated from one to another.
               Let therefore notice be taken of the particular callings Uſe. wherein God hath ſet vs, and of the ſeuerall duties of thoſe

callings, and conſcience be vſed in the practiſe of them. He is no good Chriſtian that is careleſſe herein. A bad husband, wife, parent, childe, maſter, ſeruant, magiſtrate or miniſter, is no good Chriſtian.

                  thereto, are ſuch as Chriſtians are called vnto by God, and in the exerciſing whereof, they may and muſt imploy ſome part of their time. For can we thinke that the Holy Ghoſt (who, as the Philoſophers ſpeake of nature, doth nothing in vaine) would ſo diſtinctly ſet downe theſe priuate duties, & ſo forcibly vrge them, if they did not well become, and neerely concerne Chriſtians? All the places in Scripture which require family-duties, are proofs of the truth of this doctrine.
               The reaſons of this doctrine are cleere; for the family is 
                     Reaſon. The familie a ſeminarie. a ſeminary of the Church and common-wealth. It is as a Bee-hive, in which is the ſtocke, and out of which are ſent many ſwarmes of Bees: for in families are all ſorts of people bred and brought vp: and out of families are they ſent into the Church and common-wealth. The firſt beginning of mankinde, and of his increaſe, was out of a family. For firſt did God ioyne in mariage Adam and Eue, made them husband and wife, and then gaue them children: ſo as huſband and wife, parent and childe, (which are parts of a family) were before magiſtrate and ſubiect, miniſter and people, which are the parts of a Common-wealth, and a Church. When by the generall deluge all publike ſocieties were deſtroyed, a familie, euen the family of Noah, was

preſerued, and out of it kingdomes and nations againe raiſed. That great people of the Iewes which could not be numbred for multitude, was raiſed out of the family of Abram. Yea euen to this day haue all ſorts of people come from families, and ſo ſhall to the end of the world. Whence it followeth, that a conſcionable performance of domeſticall and houſhold duties, tend to the good ordering of Church and common-wealth, as being meanes to fit and prepare men thereunto.
               Beſides, a familie is a little Church, and a little commonwealth, 2 Reaſon. A familie is a repreſentation of Church and commonwealth. at leaſt a liuely repreſentation thereof, whereby triall may be made of ſuch as are fit for any place of authoritie, or of ſubiection in Church or common-wealth. Or rather it is as a ſchoole wherein the firſt principles and grounds of gouernment and ſubiection are learned: whereby men are fitted to greater matters in Church or commonwealth. Wherupon the 1. Tim. 3. 5. Apoſtle declareth, that a Biſhop that cannot rule his own houſe, is not fit to gouerne the Church. So we may say of inferiours that cannot be ſubiect in a familie; they will hardly be brought to yeeld ſuch ſubiection as they ought in Church or common-wealth: inſtance Abſolom, and Adoniah, Dauids ſonnes.
               This is to be noted for ſatisfaction of certaine weake 1 Vſe. Priuat callings in a familie ſufficient callings. conſciences, who thinke that if they haue no publike calling, they haue no calling at all; and thereupon gather that all their time is ſpent without a calling. Which conſequence if it were good and ſound, what comfort in ſpending their time ſhould moſt women haue, who are not admitted to any publike function in Church or commonwealth? or ſeruants, children, and others who are wholly imployed in priuate affaires of the familie? But the forenamed doctrine ſheweth the vnſoundneſſe of that conſequence. Beſides, who knoweth not that the preſeruation of families tendeth to the good of Church and common-wealth? ſo as a conſcionable performance of houſhold duties, in regard of the end and fruit thereof, may be accounted a publike worke. Yea, if domeſticall duties be well and throughly performed, they will be euen enough to take vp

a mans whole time. If a maſter of a family be alſo an huſband of a wife, and a father of children, he ſhall finde worke enough: as by thoſe particular duties, which we ſhall afterwards ſhew to belong vnto maſters, husbands, and parents, may eaſily be proued. So a wife likwiſe, if ſhe alſo be a mother and a miſtris, and faithfully endeuour to doe what by vertue of thoſe callings ſhe is bound to doe, ſhall finde enough to doe. As for children vnder the gouernment of their parents, and ſeruants in a familie, their whole calling is to be obedient to their parents and maſters, and to doe what they command them in the Lord. Wherefore if they who haue no publike calling, be ſo much the more diligent in the functions of their priuate callings, they ſhall be as well accepted of the Lord, as if they had publike offices.
               Yet many therebe, who hauing no publike imployment, thinke they may ſpend their time as they liſt, either in idleneſſe, 2 Vſe. Reproofe of ſuch as hauing no publike office, thinke themſelues freed from all dutie. or in following their vaine pleaſures and delights day after day, and ſo caſt themſelues out of all calling. Such are many maſters of families who commit all the care of their houſe either to their wiues, or to ſome ſeruant, and miſpend their whole time in idleneſſe, riotouſneſſe, and voluptuouſneſſe. Such are many miſtreſſes, who ſpend their time in lying a bed, attiring themſelues, and goſhipping. Such are many young gentlemen liuing in their fathers houſes, who partly through the too-much-indulgencie and negligence of their parents, and partly through their owne headſtrong affections, and rebellious will, runne without reſtraint whither their corrupt luſts lead them. Theſe, and ſuch other like to theſe, though by Gods prouidence they be placed in callings, in warrantable callings, and in ſuch callings as miniſter vnto them matter enough of imployment, yet make themſelues to be of no calling. Now what bleſſing can they looke for from the Lord? The Lord vſeth Gods bleſſing on men diligent in their calling. to giue his bleſſing to men, while they are buſied in their callings.

               As for thoſe who haue publike offices in Church or 3. Vſe. Publike callings may not hinder priuate duties. common-wealth, they may not thereupon thinke themſelues exempted from all family-duties. Theſe priuate duties are neceſſarie duties. Though a man be a magiſtrate or a miniſter, yet if he be an husband, or a father, or a maſter, he may not neglect his wife, children, and ſeruants. Indeed they who are freed from publike functions, are bound to attend ſo much the more vpon the priuate duties of their families, becauſe they haue more leiſure thereunto. But none ought wholly to neglect them.

               §. 9. Of the Apoſtles order in laying downe the duties of husbands and wiues in the firſt place.
               
               There being three eſpeciall degrees, or orders in a familie, Why duties of man and wife firſt deliuered. (as we heard before) the Apoſtle placeth husband and wife in the firſt ranke, and firſt declareth their duties, and that not without good reaſon: for
               Firſt, The husband and wife were the firſt couple that 1. Man and wife were the firſt couple. euer were in the world. Adam and Eue were ioyned in

mariage, and made man and wife before they had children, or ſeruants. So falleth it out for the moſt part euen to this day in erecting, or bringing together a familie: the firſt couple is ordinarily an husband and a wife.
               Secondly, moſt vſually the husband and his wife are the 2. Man and wife are commonly the chiefeſt in a familie. chiefeſt in a familie, all vnder them ſingle perſons: they gouernours of all the reſt in the houſe. Therefore moſt meet it is, that they ſhould firſt know their dutie, and learne to practiſe it, that ſo they may be an example to all the reſt. If they faile in their dutie one to another, they giue occaſion to all the reſt vnder them to be careleſſe, and negligent in theirs. Let an husband be churliſh to his wife, and deſpiſe her, he miniſtreth an occaſion to children and ſeruants to contemne her likewiſe, and to be diſobedient vnto her: yea, to be churliſh and froward one to another, eſpecially to their vnderlings. Let a wife be vntruſtie and vnfaithfull to her husband, let her filch and purloine from him, children and ſeruants will ſoone take courage, or rather boldneſſe from her example priuily to ſteale what they can from their father, and maſter. Thus is their breach of Bis peccat qui exemplo peccat. dutie a double fault: one in reſpect of the party whom they wrong, and to whom they denie dutie: the other in reſpect of thoſe to whom they giue occaſion of ſinning.
               Know therefore, O husbands and wiues, that yee, aboue Vſe. all other in the familie, are moſt bound vnto a conſcionable performance of your dutie. Greater will your condemnation be, if you faile therein. Looke to it aboue the reſt: and by your example draw on your children and ſeruants (if you haue any) to performe their duties: which ſurely they will more readily do, when they ſhall behold you as guides going before them, and making conſcience of your ioynt and ſeuerall duties.

                  Wiues particular duties firſt laid downe, becauſe they are inferiours.
               
               In handling the duties of the firſt forenamed couple, the Apoſtle beginneth with wiues, and layeth downe their particular duties in the firſt place. The reaſon of this order I

take to be the inferiority of the wife to her husband. I doe the rather take it ſo to be, becauſe I obſerue this to be his vſuall method and order, firſt to declare the duties of inferiours, and then of ſuperiours: For in handling the duties of 
                     Eph. 6. 1. children and parents, and of 
                     Epheſ. 6. 5. ſeruants and maſters, he beginneth with the inferiours, both in this, and 
                     Col. 3. 18, 20, 22. in other Epiſtles; which order alſo 1 Pet. 3. 1. 
                  S. Peter obſerueth: yea, 
                     Exod. 20. 12. the law it ſelfe doth in the firſt place, and that expreſly, mention the inferiours dutie, only implying the ſuperiours to follow as a iuſt conſequence, which is this, If the inferiour muſt giue honour, and by vertue thereof performe ſuch duties as appertaine thereto, then muſt the ſuperiour carrie himſelfe worthy of honour, and by vertue thereof performe anſwerable duties.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. Why ſhould inferiours duties be more fully Inferiours duties firſt taught, becauſe they are moſt backward and loth to performe them. expreſſed, and placed in the firſt ranke?
                  
                     Anſw. Surely becauſe for the moſt part inferiours are moſt vnwilling to vndergoe the duties of their place. Who is not more ready to rule, than to be ſubiect?
                  I denie not but that it is a farre more difficult and hard matter to gouerne well than to obey well. For to rule and Greater difficultie in ruling well, than in obeying. gouerne requireth more knowledge, experience, wiſdome, care, watchfulneſſe, diligence, and other like vertues, than to obey and be ſubiect. He that obeyeth hath his rule laid before him, which is the will and command of his Ducem velim qui à fronte pariter, & tergo ſit oculatus. Timoth. apud Plutarch. ſuperiour in things lawfull, and not againſt Gods will. But the ſuperiour who commandeth, is to conſider not only what is lawfull, but alſo what is moſt fit, meet, conuenient, and euery way the beſt: yea alſo he muſt forecaſt for the time to come, and ſo farre as he can obſerue whether that which is now for the preſent meet enough, may not be dangerous for the time to come, and in that reſpect vnmeet to be vrged. Whence it followeth, that the ſuperiour in authoritie may ſinne in commanding that which the inferiour in ſubiection may vpon his command doe without ſinne. Who can iuſtly charge Ioab with ſinne in numbring the 2 Sam. 24. 2, &c.
                      people, when Dauid vrged him by vertue of his authoritie See Treat. 7. §. 37. ſo to doe? Yet did Dauid ſinne in commanding it.

Without all queſtion Saul did ſin in charging the people by an oath, to eat no food the day that they purſued their enemies (a time when they had moſt need to be refreſhed with food, as Ionathans words implie) and yet did not the people 1 Sam. 14. 24. &c.
                      ſinne in forbearing: witneſſe the euent that followed on Ionathans eating, though he knew not his fathers charge. Who ſeeth not hereby, that it is a matter of much more difficultie to rule well, than to obey? which is yet further euident by Gods wiſe diſpoſing prouidence in ordering who ſhould gouerne, who obey. Commonly the younger 
                        Seniores & inter eos optimos, & prudentes & potentes oportet imperare. Iuniores vero parere. Plat. de rep. lib 3. for age, the weaker for ſex, the meaner for eſtate, the more ignorant for vnderſtanding, with the like, are in places of ſubiection: but the elder, ſtronger, wealthier, wiſer, and ſuch like perſons, are for the moſt part, or at leaſt ſhould be in place of authority. Woe to thee ô land (
                        Eccl. 10. 16. ſaith Salomon) when thy king is a childe. And 
                        Iſa. 3. 4. 
                     Iſaiah denounceth it as a curſe to Iſrael, that children ſhall be their Princes, and babes ſhall rule ouer them, and complaineth 
                        Iſa. 3. 12. that women had rule ouer the people.
                  
                  Now to returne to the point, though it be ſo that gouernours haue the heauieſt burden laid on their ſhoulders, yet inferiours that are under ſubiection thinke their burden the heauieſt, and are lotheſt to beare it, and moſt willing to caſt it away. For naturally there is in euery one much Ambition is it which maketh inferiours loth to be ſubiect. pride and ambition, which as duſt caſt on the eies of their vnderſtanding, putteth out the ſight thereof, and ſo maketh them affect ſuperiority, and authority ouer others, and to be ſtubborne vnder the yoke of ſubiection: which is the cauſe that in all ages, both by diuine, and alſo by humane lawes, penalties and puniſhments of diuers kinds haue beene ordained, to keepe inferiours in compaſſe of their dutie: and yet (ſuch is the pride of mans heart) all will not ſerue. What age, what place euer was there, which hath 2. Inferiours duties firſt deliuered, to teach them how to winne their gouernours fauour. not iuſt cauſe to complaine of ſubiects rebellion, ſeruants ſtubbornneſſe, childrens diſobedience, wiues preſumption? Not without cauſe therefore doth the Apoſtle firſt declare the duties of inferiours.
                  Beſides, the Apoſtle would hereby teach thoſe who are

vnder authority, how to moue them that are in authority ouer them, to deale equally and kindly, not hardly and cruelly with them, namely, by endeuouring to performe their owne dutie firſt. For what is it that prouoketh wrath, rage, and fury in gouernours? What maketh them that haue authority, to deale roughly, and rigorouſly? is it not for the moſt part diſobedience, and ſtoutneſſe in thoſe that are vnder gouernment? though ſome in authority be ſo proud, ſo ſauage, and inhumane, as no honour done to them, no performance of duty can ſatisfie and content them, but they will (as 
                        Pſal. 38. 20. 
                     Dauids enemies) reward euill for goodneſſe, yet the beſt generall direction that can be preſcribed to inferiours, to prouoke their gouernours to deale well with them, is, that inferiours themſelues be carefull and conſcionable in doing their duty firſt. If their gouernours on earth be nothing moued therewith, yet will the higheſt Lord in heauen graciouſly accept it.
                  Laſtly, men muſt firſt learne to obey well, before they 3. By obeying, men learne to rule well. Parendo diſces imperare. Ariſt. Polit. lib. 3. c. 3. Uſe.
                      can rule well: for they who ſcorne to be ſubiect to their gouernours while they are vnder authority, are like to proue intolerably inſolent when they are in authority.
                  Learne all that are vnder authority, how to win your gouernours fauour: how to make your yoke eaſie, and your burden light: how to preuent many miſchiefes which by reaſon of the power of your ſuperiours ouer you may otherwiſe fall vpon you: Firſt doe ye your duty.
                  There are many weighty reaſons to moue gouernours Reaſons why gouernours ought firſt to performe their duties. firſt to begin to doe their dutie. For,
                  Firſt, by vertue of their authority they beare Gods image, therefore in doing their duty they honour that image.
                  Secondly, by reaſon of their place they ought to goe before ſuch as are vnder them.
                  Thirdly, a faithfull performance of their duty, is an eſpeciall means to keepe their inferiours in compaſſe of theirs.
                  Fourthly, their failing in duty is exemplary: it cauſeth others vnder them to faile in theirs, and ſo it is a double ſin.
                  Fiftly, their reckoning ſhall be the greater: for of them who haue receiued more, more ſhall be required.
                  
                     
It were therefore to be wiſhed that ſuperiours and inferiours would ſtriue who ſhould beginne firſt, and who ſhould 
                        Vterque ſuum praeoccupet officium. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. performe their owne part beſt, and in this kinde ſtriue to excell, as runners in a race ſtriue in running to out-ſtrip one another.
                  But if queſtion be made who ſhall beginne, I aduiſe inferiours not to ſtand out in this ſtrife, but to thinke the Apoſtle Reaſons why inferiours ought firſt to performe their duties. firſt inciteth them: and that it is the ſafeſt for them to begin: for in this contention inferiours are like to fare the worſt, by reaſon of the power which ſuperiours haue ouer them. And though it be more againſt our corrupt, proud, and ſtout nature, to be ſubiect and obey, yet let vs ſo much the more endeuour to yeeld duty in this kinde. For it is an eſpeciall part of ſpirituall prudence, to obſerue what our corrupt nature is moſt prone vnto, and wherein it moſt ſwelleth up, that therein we may moſt ſtriue to beat it downe: nature is contrary to grace, and the

                     Queſt. Why among other inferiours are wiues firſt brought into the ſchoole of Chriſt to learne their duty?
                  
                     Anſw. Many good reaſons may be giuen of the Apoſtles order euen in this point.
                  Firſt, of all other inferiours in a family, wiues are farre the moſt excellent, and therefore to be placed in the firſt ranke.
                  Secondly, wiues were the firſt to whom ſubiection was inioyned: before there was childe or ſeruant in the world, it was ſaid to her, thy deſire ſhall be ſubiect to thine husband. 
                     
                        Gen. 3. 16.
                  
                  Thirdly, wiues are the fountaine from whence all other degrees ſpring: and therefore ought firſt to be cleanſed.
                  Fourthly, this ſubiection is a good patterne vnto children and ſeruants: and a great means to moue them to be ſubiect.
                  Fiftly, I may further adde as a truth, which is too manifeſt by experience in all places, that among all other parties of whom the Holy Ghoſt requireth ſubiection, wiues for

the moſt part are See Treat. 3. §. 4. moſt back ward in yeelding ſubiection to their husbands. But yee wiues that feare God, be carefull of your duty: and though it may ſeeme ſomewhat contrary to 
                        Exod. 23. 2. the common courſe and practiſe of wiues, yet follow not a multitude to doe euill. Though it be harſh to corrupt nature, 
                        Si propter Deum viro parueris, noli proponere quae ab eo fieri deceant, ſed ea quibus te legiſlator ſecit obnoxiam diligenter exequere. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. yet beat downe that corruption: yea though your husbands be backward in their duties, yet be ye forward, and ſtriue to goe before them in yours: remembring what the Lord ſaith (Mat. 5. 46, 47.) If you loue them which loue you, what ſingular thing doe ye? Yea remembring alſo what the Apoſtle ſaith, (1 Tim. 2. 14.) The woman was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, 
                     
                        Gen. 3. 16. and firſt had her duty giuen vnto her, and 1 Cor. 11. 9. 
                     was made for the man, and not man for the woman.
                  
                  Thus ſhall ye deſerue that commendation of good wiues,

                  Hauing hitherto handled the forenamed generall inſtructions, I will proceed to a more diſtinct opening of the words; and collect ſuch obſeruations as thence ariſe, and then particularly declare the ſeuerall duties which the three orders in a family owe each to other.
               
            
            
               §. 12. Of wiues ſubiection.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 22.
                  Wiues ſubmit your ſelues vnto your owne husbands, as vnto the Lord.

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . word by which the Apoſtle hath noted out the duties of wiues, is of the middle voice, and may be tranſlated paſſiuely as Subditae ſint. Hieron. Vet. Tranſ. Eraſm. many haue done, or Subijcite vos. Beza. actiuely as our Engliſh doth (ſubmit your ſelues) and that moſt fitly: for there is a double ſubiection.
               1. A neceſſary ſubiection: which is the ſubiection of order.
               
               2. A Voluntary ſubiection: which is the ſubiection of duty. The neceſſary ſubiection is that degree of inferioritie,

wherein God hath placed all inferiours, and whereby he hath ſubiected them to their ſuperiours, that is, ſet them in a lower ranke. By vertue thereof, though inferiours ſeeke to exalt themſelues aboue their ſuperiours, yet are they ſubiect unto them, their ambition doth not take away that order which God hath eſtabliſhed. A wife is in an inferiour degree, though ſhe domineere neuer ſo much ouer her huſband.
               The Uoluntary ſubiection, is that dutifull reſpect which inferiours carry towards thoſe whom God hath ſet ouer them: whereby they manifeſt a willingneſſe to yeeld to that order which God hath eſtabliſhed. Becauſe God hath placed them vnder their ſuperiours, they will in all duty manifeſt that ſubiection which their place requireth.
               Becauſe it is a duty which is here required, the Voluntary ſubiection muſt needs be here meant: and to expreſſe ſo much, it is thus ſet downe, ſubmit your ſelues.
               
               Though the ſame word be here vſed that was in the former verſe, yet it is reſtrained to a narrower compaſſe, namely to See §. 3. 
                  ſubiection of reuerence.
               
               Here learne that to neceſſary ſubiection, muſt voluntary ſubiection

                  be added: that is, duty muſt be performed according to that order and degree wherein God hath ſet vs. This is to make a vertue of neceſſity.
               Vnder this phraſe (ſubmit your ſelues) all the duties which a wife oweth to her husband are compriſed, as I ſhall 
                     Treat. 3. §. 2. afterwards more diſtinctly ſhew.
            
            
               §. 13. Of the perſons to whom wiues muſt be ſubiect.
               
               In ſetting downe the parties to whom wiues owe ſubiection, the Apoſtle noteth a particle of reſtraint (
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  owne) and that to ſhew that a wife ought to haue but one huſband, which is more plainly expreſſed in another place by the ſame phraſe, let euery woman haue her owne husband: that 1 Cor. 7. 2. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . See §. 82, 83. is, only one proper to her ſelfe: ſo as
               
                  It is vnlawfull for a wife to haue more than one husband at once.
               
               A wife muſt ſubmit her ſelfe only to that one, proper 2. Obſer.
                  
                  
husband, and to no other man (as ſhe is a wife and yeeldeth the duty of a wife) ſo as the ſubiection of adultereſſes is here excluded: and the duty required is, that
               
                  A wife muſt yeeld a chaſte, faithfull, matrimoniall ſubiection 
                  3. Obſer.
                   
                  to her husband.
               
               Here by the way note the fooliſh 
                     Adamiani ex Adam dicti, cuius imitantur in paradiſo nuditatem. Nuptias auerſantur. Nudi itaque mares foeminaeque conueniunt, &c. Auguſt. de Haereſ. diſtinct. 31. Promiſcuè inter ſe viri & foeminae, Veneri operam dabant. Philaſt.
                   collection of Adamites, Familiſts, and ſuch like licentious libertines, who from the generall words which the Apoſtle vſeth (men 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . and women) inferre that all women are as wiues to all men, and that there needeth not any ſuch neere coniunction of one man with one woman. Which beaſtly opinion as it is contrary to the current of Scripture, and to the ancient law of mariage (two ſhall be one fleſh) ſo alſo to this clauſe (their owne husbands.) The Apoſtle, in vſing thoſe generall words, followed the Greeke phraſe, which putteth thoſe two words (men women) for huſbands and wiues: ſo alſo doe other tongues, yea and our Engliſh. The particular relation, which is betwixt the perſons who are meant by thoſe two words, doth plainly ſhew how they are to be taken, and when they are to be reſtrained to man and wife. To take away that ambiguity, our Engliſh hath well tranſlated them, husband and wife.
               
               To direct and prouoke wiues vnto their duty, the Apoſtle addeth this clauſe (as vnto the Lord) which is both a Rule and a Reaſon of wiues ſubiection. It directeth wiues by noting the reſtraint of their obedience, and the manner thereof.
               The reſtraint in that wiues ought ſo to obey their husbands 
                  4. Obſer. See Treat. 3. §. 51. 
                  as withall they obey the Lord; but no further: they may not be ſubiect in any thing to their husbands, that cannot ſtand with their ſubiection to the Lord.
               The manner in that wiues ought to yeeld ſuch a kind of ſubiection 
                  5. Obſer. See Treat. 3. §. 54. 
                  to their husbands, as may be approued of the Lord.
               
               
                  
Thus the Apoſtle himſelfe expoundeth this phraſe, chap. 5. verſ. 5, 6.
               It prouoketh wiues to ſubmit themſelues to their huſbands, by noting the place of an husband, which is, to be in the Lords ſtead, bearing his image, and in that reſpect hauing a fellowſhip and partnerſhip with the Lord, ſo as
               
                  Wiues in ſubiecting themſelues aright to their husbands are ſubiect to the Lord. And on the contrary ſide, 6. Obſer.
                  
               
               
                  Wiues in refuſing to be ſubiect to their husbands, refuſe to be ſubiect to the Lord.

               §. 14. How an husband is his wiues head.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 23.
                  For the husband is the head of the wife, euen as Chriſt is the head of the Church: and he is the Sauiour of the body.
               
               THe place of an husband intimated in the laſt clauſe of the former verſe, is more plainly expreſſed, and fully explained in this verſe. His place is expreſſed vnder the metaphor of an head: and amplified by his reſemblance therein vnto Chriſt.
               
               The particle of connexion (FOR) ſheweth that this verſe is added as a reaſon: which may fitly be referred both to the duty it ſelfe: and to the manner of performing it.
               The metaphor of an head enforceth the duty.
               
               The amplification thereof by the reſemblance that is made to Chriſt, enforceth the manner of performing the duty.
               
               A wife muſt ſubmit her ſelfe to an husband, becauſe he is her head: and ſhe muſt doe it as to the Lord, becauſe her husband is to her, as Chriſt is to the Church.
               The metaphor of an head declareth two points:
               
                  
                     
                        1. The dignitie
                        of an husband.
                     
                     
                        2. The duty
                         
                     
                  
               
               
                  
1. As an head is more eminent and excellent than the body, and placed aboue it, ſo is an husband to his wife.
               2. As an head, by the vnderſtanding which is in it, gouerneth, protecteth, preſerueth, prouideth for the body, ſo doth the husband his wife: at leaſt he ought ſo to doe: for this is his office and duty: this is here noted to ſhew the benefit which a wife receiueth by her husband: ſo as two motiues are included vnder this metaphor.
               The firſt is taken from the husbands prerogatiue, whence note that
               
                  Subiection muſt be yeelded to ſuch as are ouer vs. For this is a maine end of the difference betweene partie and partie. Obſer. To what end is the head ſet aboue the body, if the body be not ſubiect to it?
               The ſecond is taken from the benefit which a wife reapeth by her husbands ſuperiority: and it ſheweth that
               
                  They who will not ſubmit themſelues to their ſuperiours are 
                  
                     Obſer. See Treat. 3. §. 73. 
                  iniurious to themſelues: as the body were iniurious to it ſelfe, if it would not be ſubiect to the head.
            
            
               §. 15. Of the reſemblance of an husband to Chriſt.
               
               The more to enforce the forenamed reaſon, the Apoſtle addeth the reſemblance that is betwixt an husband and Chriſt, as this note of compariſon (
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  euen as) ſheweth: whence it followeth that
               
                  It is as meet for a wife to ſubmit her ſelfe to her husband, as 
                  Obſer. 
                  for the Church to ſubmit it ſelfe to Chriſt. This amplification is eſpecially added for Chriſtians. Heathens may be moued to ſubiect themſelues to their gouernours, by the reſemblance taken from a naturall body. How much more ought Chriſtians to be moued by the reſemblance taken from the myſticall body of Chriſt?
               Theſe words (and he is the Sauiour of the body) as they doe declare the office of Chriſt, and the benefit which the Church reapeth, ſo they note the end why an husband is appointed to be the head of his wife, namely that by his prouident care he may be as a ſauiour to her. It is here noted rather to ſhew the benefit which a wife reapeth by her

husband, then the dutie which he oweth: for that the Apoſtle declareth afterwards, verſ. 25, &c. The meaning then is, That as Chriſt was giuen to be an head of the Church which is his body, that he might protect it, and prouide all needfull things for it, and ſo be a Sauiour to it, euen ſo How an huſband is a Sauiour to his wife See Treat. 3. §. 73. for that very end are husbands appointed to be the head of their wiues.
               Vpon this ground the Apoſtle inferreth the concluſion in the next verſe.
            
            
               §. 16. Of the reſemblance betwixt
                  
                     The Church to Chriſt.
                     A wife to her husband.
                  
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 24
                  Therefore as the Church is ſubiect to Chriſt, ſo let wiues be to their owne husbands in euery thing.
               
               THis concluſion ſetteth forth not only the dutie it ſelfe, but alſo another Reaſon, and another Rule to prouoke and direct wiues to performe their dutie: and that vnder the patterne of the Church.
               The reaſon may be thus framed, That which the Church doth to Chriſt, a wife muſt doe to her husband. But the Church is ſubiect to Chriſt. Therefore a wife muſt be ſubiect to her husband.
               
               The propoſition is grounded on that reſemblance which is betwixt the Church in relation to Chriſt, and a wife in relation to her husband: for an husband is that to his wife, which Chriſt is to the Church; therefore a wife muſt be ſo to her husband, as the Church is to Chriſt.
               The rule noteth both the Manner (
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     Queſt. Is mortall and ſinfull man to be obeyed as the Lord Chriſt the eternall Sonne of God?
                  
                     Anſw. This extent is to be reſtrained to the generalitie of the things in queſtion. As in other places, where the

Apoſtle ſaith, all things are lawfull for me, he meaneth all 1 Cor. 10. 23. indifferent things, for of them his ſpeech was in that place. And where againe he ſaith, Whatſoeuer is ſet before you, eat, 
                     
                        Vers. 27. he meaneth, whatſoeuer good and wholſome meat: for of that he ſpake.
                  Thus much of the maine drift of the Apoſtle in ſetting before wiues the example of Chriſt, to whom husbands are like in dignitie, and the example of the Church, to whom wiues ought to be like in dutie.
                  I will further conſider theſe examples of Chriſt and the Church more diſtinctly by themſelues, without any relation to man and wife: and out of them note ſuch generall inſtructions as concerne all Chriſtians.

               The title Head, is giuen to Chriſt in two reſpects.
               1. In regard of his 
                     Col. 1. 18. dignitie and dominion ouer the Church.
               2. In regard of the 
                     Epheſ. 4. 15, 16. neere vnion betwixt him and the Church.
               
                  
This vnion is more fully expreſſed afterwards, verſ. 30.
               The dignitie of Chriſt is here principally intended: ſo as Chriſt is the higheſt in authoritie ouer the Church: the titles Doctr. 
                  1 Cor. 8. 6. 
                  Lord, 
                  
                     Mat. 23. 7, 8, 9.

                     Deut. 18. 15. 
                  Prophet, 
                  
                     Col. 1. 18. 
                  Firſt-borne, with the like, being by a kinde of excellencie and proprietie attributed to him, proue as much.
               The cauſes hereof are
               
                  1. The good pleaſure of God his Father.
                  2. The dignitie of his perſon being God-Man.
                  3. The merit of his ſacrifice whereby he hath redeemed and purchaſed his Church vnto himſelfe.
                  4. The omnipotencie of his power whereby he is able to protect it.
                  5. The all-ſufficiencie of ſpirit, whereby he is able to giue to euery member all needfull grace.
               
               Till the Pope of Rome can ſhew ſo good reaſon for this 1 Vse.
                   title (Supreme head of the whole Church) we will account him a blaſphemous vſurper thereof.
               
                  Object. He is not accounted an Imperiall head as Chriſt is, The diſtinction betwixt imperiall and miniſteriall head diſcuſſed. but only a Miniſteriall head.
               
                  Anſw.
               
               1. This diſtinction is without all ground or warrant of Scripture.
               2. It implieth plaine contradiction. For to be a miniſteriall head, is to be an head and a miniſter, which is all one as an head and a member in relation to the ſame thing.
               3. Though in theſe two words (Imperiall, Miniſteriall) they may ſeeme to aduance Chriſt aboue the Pope, yet in their owne interpretation of theſe words they make the Pope equall 
                     Staplet. lib. 6. cap. 16. de princip. doct.
                   to Chriſt, if not aduance him aboue Chriſt. For they ſay that Chriſt is an imperiall head to quicken the Church inwardly: and the Pope a miniſteriall head to gouerne it outwardly. Firſt let it be noted, how little congruitie this expoſition hath with the words expounded. Doth this word (imperiall) intimate a quickning vertue? Doth this word (miniſteriall) implie a gouerning power? Nay, is there not great incongruitie in this, that Chriſt ſhould be the Imperiall head, and yet the Pope an head to gouerne? Beſides, doth not this rend aſunder two of Chriſts offices, and leauing one to Chriſt, giue another to the

Pope, and ſo make him equall with Chriſt? If the particular branches of this gouernment which is giuen by papiſts vnto the Pope by vertue of his headſhip be obſerued, we ſhall finde that to be verified in him, which the Apoſtle hath foretold concerning Antichriſt, that as God he ſitteth in the temple of 
                  2 Theſſ. 2. 4. 
                  God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God. For they giue to him the keyes of heauen and hell, to ſhut or open the one or other as In Decretal. pleaſeth him: they giue him power to diſpenſe with Gods lawes, to coine articles of faith, to make lawes to binde mens conſciences directly and immediatly, to giue pardon for ſinne, to free ſubiects from allegeance to their Soueraignes, to canonize Saints, and what not? But to let theſe impious blaſpliemies paſſe, beſide that this prerogatiue of Chriſt (to be head of 
                  
                     Eph. 1. 21, 22, 23 
                  the Church) is incommunicable (for thereby the Apoſtle proueth Chriſt to be aduanced farre aboue all principalitie, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name, &c.) Chriſt needeth not for the execution of his office therein any Vicar, or Deputie: for as head he filleth all in all things: and by his eternall ſpirit is he in heauen, earth, and euery place where any of his members are, according to his 
                     Mat. 18. 20. & 28. 20. promiſes made vnto his Church.
               Much comfort and great confidence muſt this needs miniſter Vſe. to all ſuch as haue aſſurance that they are of this bodie: for hauing ſo mightie, ſo wiſe, ſo mercifull an head, an head ſo ſufficient euery way, who can inſtruct, direct, guide, gouerne, protect, and helpe them in all their needs whatſoeuer, what need they feare? When we are aſſaulted by Satan, or any way ſet vpon by any of his inſtruments, or are in any diſtreſſe or need, let vs lift vp the eies of our faith higher then we can the eies of our bodie, and in heauen behold this our head, who is inuiſible, and we cannot but receiue from thence much comfort, and incouragement.
            
            
               §. 18. Of the benefit of Chriſts headſhip.
               
               The Goodneſſe of Chriſt is ſet downe in theſe words (and he is the Sauiour of the bodie) Euery word almoſt hath his emphaſis.
               1. The copulatiue particle (AND) ſheweth that
               
                  The goodneſſe which Chriſt doth for his Church, he doth becauſe 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      1. Obſer.
                   
                  he is the head thereof.
               
               
                  
O how happie a thing is it for the Church that it hath ſuch an head! an head that doth not tyrannize ouer it, nor trample it vnder foot: an head that doth not pole, or peele the Church: but procureth peace and ſafetie to it. When Naomi ſought to make a match betwixt Boaz and Ruth, that he might be her 
                     Ruth 3. 1. head, what ſaith ſhe? Shall I not ſeeke reſt for thee that it may be well with thee? It is therefore the office of an head to be a Sauiour, to procure reſt and proſperitie to the bodie whoſe head it is.
               Happie were it for Kingdomes, Common-wealths, Cities, Churches, Families, wiues, and all that haue heads, if they were ſuch heads: that, becauſe they are heads, they would endeuour to be Sauiours.
            
            
               §. 19. Of Chriſt a ſufficient Sauiour.
               In laying forth the goodneſſe of Chriſt three things are noted.
               
                  1. The Kinde of goodneſſe, which is Saluation (the Sauiour)
                  
                  2. The perſon that performeth it (he himſelfe.)
                  
                  3. The parties for whom he performeth it (the body.)
                  
               
               1. The Greeke word tranſlated 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Sotera inſtrip tum vidi Syracuſis. hoc quantum eſt? Ita magnum, vt Latino vno verbo exprimi non poſſit. Is eſt nimirum ſoter, qui ſalutem dedit. Cicer. in Ver. act 4. 
                  Sauiour is ſo emphaticall that other tongues can hardly finde a fit word to expreſſe the emphaſis thereof: it being attributed to Chriſt, implieth that
               
                  Chriſt is a moſt abſolute and perfect Sauiour, he is euery way a ſufficient Sauiour: 
                     Heb. 7. 25. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Mat. 1. 21. 
                  able perfectly to ſaue euen to the very vttermoſt. He ſaueth Soule and Body: he ſaueth from all manner of miſerie: which is intimated by that particular from Doct. which he ſaueth, namely ſinne: he ſhall ſaue his people from their ſinnes. Sinne is the greateſt, and moſt grieuous euill; yea, the cauſe of all miſerie: they who are ſaued from it, are ſaued from all euill: for there is nothing hurtfull to man, but that which is cauſed by ſinne, or poiſoned by it.
               Before ſinne ſeazed on man he was moſt happie, free from all miſerie: and ſo ſhall he be after the contagion, guilt, puniſhment, dominion, and remainder of ſinne is remoued. But he that remaineth in the bondage of ſinne is in a moſt wofull plight. In that Chriſt ſaueth from ſinne, he ſaueth from the wrath of God, the curſe of the law, the venome of all outward

croſſes, the tyranie of Satan, the ſting of Death, the power of the graue, the torments of hell, and what not?
               The puritie of Chriſts nature, and excellencie of his perſon Reaſon. is it that maketh him ſo ſufficient a Sauiour: which reaſon the Apoſtle himſelfe noteth: for where he ſaith that Chriſt is able to ſaue to the vttermoſt, he addeth, for proofe thereof, that he 
                     Heb. 7. 25, 26. is Holy, harmleſſe, vndefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher then the heauens.
               
               Great matter of reioycing, and of confidence doth this miniſter 
                     Vſes. Conſolation. Luk. 2. 10, 11. Luk 1. 47. vnto vs. When the Angell firſt brought this newes, To you is borne a Sauiour, he ſaith, Behold I bring you good tidings of great ioy. This made the Virgin Mary ſay, My ſpirit hath reioyced in God my Sauiour, and for this did Zacharias bleſſe God that redeemed his people, and raiſed vp an horne of ſaluation. 
                  
                     Verſ. 68, 69. When the eies of old Simeon had ſeene this Saluation, he deſired no longer to liue, but ſaid, Lord now letteſt thou thy ſeruant 
                  
                     Luk. 2. 29, 30. 
                  depart in peace.
               
               They who beleeue in this Sauiour will be of like minde: and as they reioyce in him, ſo they will truſt vnto him, and ſay with the Apoſtle, we are more then conquerors through him 
                  
                     Rom. 8. 37. 
                  that loued vs, &c.
               
               This being ſo, to what end ſerueth the ſuppoſed treaſure of 
                  Refut. 
                  the Church, wherein are ſaid to be ſtored vp indulgences, pardons, merits, workes of ſupererogation, and I know not what traſh, to adde to the ſatisfaction of this Sauiour? either Chriſt is not a ſufficient Sauiour, or theſe are (to ſpeake the leaſt) vaine. But vaine they are: & an emptie, filthie, deteſtable treaſure that is, which God will deſtroy with all that truſt therein.
            
            
               §. 20. Of Chriſt the only Sauiour.
               
               This relatiue particle (
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . HEE) hath alſo his emphaſis; for as it pointeth out Chriſt the head of the Church, ſo it reſtraineth this great worke to him: it may thus be tranſlated, he himſelfe: that is, he in his owne perſon, he by himſelfe, he and none but he. So as to ſpeak properly,
               
                  Chriſt is the only Sauiour of men: in which reſpect he is Doct. called 
                     Luk. 1. 69. 
                  the horne of ſaluation, yea 
                     & 2. 30. 
                  Saluation it ſelfe: which titles are giuen to him by an excellency and propriety: and in the ſame reſpect the name 
                     Mat. 1. 21. 
                  Ieſus was giuen vnto him.
               
                  
Here by the way note the blaſphemous arrogancie of thoſe great ſectaries among the Papiſts, who ſtile themſelues Ieſuits: aſſuming that name which is proper to this great office of Ieſus Chriſt.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Why is this name more blaſphemous, then the title Chriſtians?
                  
                  
                     Anſw. One of their owne religion doth thus reſolue that Obiection: We are called Chriſtians of Chriſt, not Ieſuits of Ieſus, becauſe we partake of the thing ſignified by the name Chriſt, that is anointing: for (as the Apoſtle ſaith) we all receiue of his fulneſſe. But he hath not communicated to vs the thing ſignified by the name Ieſus; for it belongeth to him alone to ſaue, as ſaith the ſcripture, he ſhall ſaue his people: as if he ſhould ſay, he alone, and no other. A Chriſto dicimur 
                     Ieſuit a blaſphemous title. 
                     Chriſtiani, non autem à Ieſu Ieſuani, ſeu Ieſuitae: quia rem ſignatam nomine Chriſtus, ſcil. vnctionem nobis communicauit. Nam, ut ait Apoſtolus, omnes nos de plenitudine eius accepimus: ſed rem ſignificatam nomine Ieſus Why we may be called Chriſtians and not Ieſuits. 
                     non communicauit: nam ſaluare ipſi ſoli conuenit: ipſe enim (vt dicitur in ſcriptura) ſaluum faciet 
                     
                        Chriſtus commune dignitatis eſt nomen. Ieſus proprium vocabulum ſaluatoris. Hier. in Mat. 16. 
                     populum ſuum: ac ſi diceret, ipſe ſolus, & non alius. Guil. Lindwood in Prouinc. ſiue Conſtitut. Angl. lib. de Conſuetud.
                  
                  But to returne to our matter, Saint Peter doth moſt plainly and fully proue the forenamed doctrine in theſe words ſpoken of Ieſus Chriſt, 
                        Act. 4. 12. 
                     There is not ſaluation in any other: for there is none other name vnder heauen giuen among men whereby we muſt be ſaued. None is able, 
                        Reu. 5. 4, 5. none is worthy to worke ſo great 1. Vſe.
                      a worke: he muſt doe it, or it can not be done. But

                  What a dotage is it to truſt to other Sauiours? Legions of 
                        Virum multi ſalutares dici poſſint non facile audendum eſt. Solus enim ipſe ſaluator corporis eſt. Aug. in Ioſ. lib. 6. quaeſt. 23. Sauiours haue Papiſts to whom they flie in their need. All the Angels in heauen, and all, whom at any time their Popes haue canonized for Saints (which are many millions) are made Sauiours by them. 
                        Ier. 2. 12, 13. 
                     Be aſtoniſhed, O ye heauens, at this: for they haue committed two euils: they haue forſaken Chriſt the fountaine of liuing waters, and hewed them out ciſternes, broken ciſterns that can hold no water.
                  
                  
                     
Let vs for our parts flie vnto this Sauiour only, and wholly 2. Vſe.
                      rely vpon him, as we deſire to be ſaued. Thus ſhall we honour him by preferring him before all: yea by reiecting all but him: and thus ſhall we be ſure to bring helpe, eaſe and comfort to our owne ſoules.
               
            
            
               §. 21. Of the Church the body of Chriſt.
               
               The perſons who receiue any benefit by this Sauiour, are all compriſed vnder this metaphor the bodie: whereby the ſamething is meant that was meant before by the Church.
               
               
                  Church according to the notation of the Greeke word ſignifieth 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Eccleſia ex vocatione appellata eſt. Aug. in Epiſt. ad Rom.
                   an aſſembly called together. It is in Scripture by a propriety attributed to them who are called to God.
               This calling is twofold:
               1. Outward, which is common to all that make profeſſion 
                     Mat. 20. 16. of the Goſpell: in this reſpect it is ſaid, many are called and few choſen.
               
               2. Inward, which is proper to the elect, none but they, and all they in their time ſhall both outwardly be called by the word to a profeſſion of Chriſt, and alſo inwardly and effectually by the ſpirit to beleeue in Chriſt, and obey his Goſpell. This is ſtiled 
                     Heb. 3. 1. 
                  an heauenly calling, which is 1 Cor. 1. 2. proper to the Saints. Theſe make that Church, whereof Chriſt is properly the head: and therefore in relation to that metaphor of an head, they are called the Bodie: and that in theſe reſpects;
               
                  1. They are vnder Chriſt, as a body vnder the head.
                  2. They receiue ſpirituall life and grace from Chriſt, as a body naturall receiueth ſenſe, and vigour from the head.
                  3. Chriſt gouerneth them, as an head the body.
                  4. They are ſubiect to Chriſt, as a body to the head.
               
            
            
               §. 22. Of the extent of Chriſts goodneſſe to all his body.
               
               This metaphor, by which the perſons that reape the benefit of Chriſts office are ſet forth, noteth two points.
               1. All that are once incorporated into Chriſt ſhall be ſaued. The bodie compriſeth all the parts and members vnder it: not only armes, ſhoulders, breaſt, backe, and ſuch like: but

alſo hands, fingers, feet, toes, and all. Chriſt their head being their Sauiour, who can doubt of their ſaluation?
               2. None but thoſe that are incorporated into Chriſt ſhall be ſaued. For this priuiledge is appropriated to the bodie.
               
               The former point is clearely ſet forth by a reſemblance, which the Apoſtle maketh betwixt Adam and Chriſt, thus: As by the offence of one, iudgement came on all men to condemnation, 
                  
                     Rom. 5. 18. 
                  euen ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came on all men vnto iuſtification of life. Here are noted two roots, one is Adam, the other is Chriſt: both of them haue their number of branches, to all which they conuey that which is in them, as the root conueyeth the ſap that is in it, into all the branches that ſprout from it. The firſt root, which is Adam, conueyeth ſinne and death to all that come from him: and the other root, which is Chriſt, conueyeth grace and life to euerie one that is giuen to him: for ſaith he, All that the Father 
                  
                     Ioh. 6. 37. 
                  giueth me, ſhall come to me: and him that commeth to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out: and a little after, he rendreth this reaſon, This is the Fathers will, that of all which he hath giuen me 
                  
                     Verſ. 39. 
                  I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it vp againe at the laſt day.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Chriſt himſelfe maketh exception of one, where he ſaith, none is loſt but the ſonne of perdition. 
                     
                        Ioh. 17. 12.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. That phraſe ſonne of perdition, ſheweth that Iudas was neuer of this body: for can we imagine that Chriſt is a Sauiour of a ſonne of perdition?
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Why is he then excepted?
                  
                     Anſw. By reaſon of his office and calling he ſeemed to be of this body, and till he was made knowne, none could otherwiſe iudge of him, in which reſpect Saint Peter ſaith, he was 
                     
                        Act. 1. 17. 
                     numbred with vs.
                  
                  2. Anſw. Chriſt there ſpeaketh in particular of the twelue Apoſtles, and to be an Apoſtle of Chriſt was in it ſelfe but an outward calling.
                  This is a point of admirable comfort to ſuch as haue aſſurance Vſe. of their incorporation into Chriſt, they may reſt vpon the benefit of this office of Chriſt, that he is a Sauiour. We need not thinke of climing vp to heauen, and ſearching Gods records to ſee if our names be written in the booke of Life.

Let vs only make triall whether we be of this body or no. How we may know whethe we be of Chriſts body or no. For our helpe herein, know we that this metaphor of a body implieth two things.

                        1. A myſticall vnion with Chriſt.
                        2. A ſpirituall communion with the Saints.
                     
                  
                  
                     1. By vertue of that vnion they who are of Chriſts body,

                           1. 
                                 Eph. 4. 15, 16. Receiue grace, and life from him.
                           2. 
                                 Ioh. 17. 6. Are guided and gouerned according to his will.
                           3. 
                                 Joh. 17. 10 Seeke to honour him in all things they doe.
                           4. 
                                 Gal. 3. 1. Pſal. 116. 136. Are offended and grieued when he is diſhonoured by others.
                        
                     
                     2. By reaſon of their communion with the Saints being fellow members,

                           1. 1 Ioh. 4. 11. They loue the brethren.
                           2. 
                                 Mat. 25. 40. They are ready to ſuccour ſuch as are in diſtreſſe.
                           3. 
                                 Eph. 4. 16. They will edifie one another.
                           4. 1 Cor. 12. 26. They retaine a mutuall ſympathy: reioycing, and mourning one with another.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               §. 23. Of the reſtraint of the benefit of Chriſts headſhip to them only that are of his body.
               
               That none but thoſe who are of Chriſts body, ſhall partake of the benefit of his office, is cleare by other like titles of reſtraint, as 
                     Mat. 1. 21. 
                  his people, and 
                  
                     Ioh. 10. 15. 
                  his ſheepe: but eſpecially by denying to the world the benefit of his interceſſion. 
                     Ioh. 17. 9. 
                  I pray not for the world, ſaith he. In this reſpect this poſition (out of the Church no ſaluation) is without exception true: for the body is the true, Catholike, inuiſible Church: he that is not a member of this Church, but is out of it, hath not Chriſt to be his head 
                     Eccleſia corpus Chriſti eſt: vnde manifeſtum eſt, eum qui non eſt in membris Chriſti Chriſtianam ſalutem habere non poſſe. Aug. de Vnit. Ec l. c. 2. and Sauiour, whence then can he haue ſaluation?
               The former point is not more comfortable to thoſe that haue aſſurance that they are members of this body, then this is terrible to thoſe that giue too great euidence they are no members thereof; as all they doe that haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt ruling in them, but rather rebell againſt him: and beare no loue to the Saints, but rather hate them, and doe them all the ſpight they can.
            
            
               
               §. 24. Of the Churches ſubiection to Chriſt.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 24.
                  The Church is ſubiect vnto Chriſt in euery thing.
               
               THe duty which the Church in way of thankfulneſſe performeth to Chriſt her head for this great benefit, that he is her Sauiour, is Subiection: Vnder which word is compriſed all that obedience and duty, which in any kinde Chriſt requireth of the Church, in and by the word.
               
                  
                     Queſt. Is it poſſible for that part of the Church which is here on earth, to yeeld ſuch obedience?
                  
                     Anſw. It will faithfully endeuour to doe what it can: and that honeſt and vtmoſt endeuour Chriſt graciouſly accepteth for a perfect performance of all.
                  In that it is here taken for grant, that the Church is ſubiect to Chriſt; I may, as from a generall to particular, infer that
                  
                     Whoſoeuer is of the true Catholike Church is ſubiect to Chriſt, and yeeldeth obedience to his word. We will runne after thee, 
                     Doctr. ſaith the Church to Chriſt. My ſheepe heare my voice and follow 
                     
                        Cant. 1. 3. 
                     me, ſaith Chriſt of that flocke, which is his Church. 
                        Iohn 10. 27.
                  
                  For Chriſt conueyeth his owne ſpirit into his myſticall body the Church, and into every member thereof: which ſpirit is Reaſon. much more operatiue, and liuely then the ſoule of man. If therefore mans ſoule quickning euery part of the naturall body, make them ſubiect to the head, much more will the ſpirit of Chriſt bring the members of his myſticall body in ſubiection to himſelfe. If the ſpirit of him that raiſed vp Ieſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, 
                     
                        Rom. 8. 11. 
                     ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies, by the ſpirit that dwelleth in you.
                  
                  Hereby let triall be made of particular viſible Churches and of particular perſons, whether they are in deed of this true Catholike 
                        Uſe. Triall of true Churches. Church or no. Thoſe viſible Churches which refuſe to be gouerned by Chriſts word, and are wholly gouerned by humane traditions, which riſe againſt Chriſt and play the adultereſſes

by committing Idolatry, are not of this Catholike Church which is ſubiect to Chriſt. No more are Infidels that defie Chriſt, Heretiques that deny him, ignorant perſons that know not his will, profane perſons that deſpiſe him, wordlings that lightly eſteeme him, nor any that perſecute or ſcorne him in his members. By this we may ſee that many haue a name that they are of the Church, who in deed are not.
                  
                     Obiect. Many ſuch perſons may belong to Gods election, and ſo be of that body whereof Chriſt is a Sauiour.
                  
                     Anſw. Election in deed giueth them a title to Chriſt, but they cannot reape any benefit by that title till they haue a poſſeſſion of Chriſt by vertue of their ſpirituall vnion with him. Neither can they haue any aſſurance of their election, till they finde by the quickning vertue of the ſpirit, that they are vnited vnto Chriſt. Wherefore ſo long as men remaine deſtitute of the Spirit of Chriſt, and are poſſeſſed with a contrary ſpirit, they may well be iudged for the preſent to be none of this body, nor to haue any part in Chriſt, their future eſtate being referred to him who only knoweth what it ſhall be.
               
            
            
               §. 25. Of the extent of the Churches ſubiection.
               
               The extent of the Churches ſubiection to Chriſt is without any reſtraint at all, in every thing. For there is nothing which Chriſt requireth of her, but ſhe may with a good conſcience, and muſt in obedience yeeld unto. Iuſt, and pure, and perfect are all his commandements, there is no error in any of them: no miſchiefe or inconuenience can follow vpon the keeping of them. This extent being here taken for grant, I may further inferre that
               
                  They who are of the true Catholike Church will yeeld vniuerſall 
                  Doctr. 
                  obedience to Chriſt: they will obey him in all and euery of his commandements. Dauid turned not aſide from any thing that 
                  1 Kings 15. 5. 
                  the Lord commanded him. Ioſiah turned to the Lord with all his 
                  2 Kings 23. 25. Luke 1. 6. 
                  heart according to all the law: and Zacharias, and Elizabeth, walked in all the commandements of God. All theſe were of this Church: and of their minde are all others that are of this Church.
               For the ſpirit of Chriſt which is in them worketh a thorow Reaſon.
                  
reformation: euen as the fleſh leadeth a naturall man on to euery ſinne, ſo the ſpirit of Chriſt ſtirreth him vp to euery good duty. In which reſpect it is ſaid, that whoſoeuer is borne of God 
                  1 John 3. 9. 
                  doth not commit ſinne.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. The beſt Saints in all ages haue tranſgreſſed in many 
                        Iam. 3. 2. things.
                  
                     Anſw. Their ſinnes though grieuous, haue not wilfully in open rebellion againſt Chriſt beene committed, but they haue ſlipped from them partly through their owne weakneſſe, and partly through the violence of ſome temptation. So as that which the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe, may be applied to all that are of the body of Chriſt, That which I doe I allow not: Now then 
                     
                        Rom. 7. 15. 17. 
                     is it no more I that doe it, but the ſinne that dwelleth in me.
                  
                  This extent is a good proofe of the truth of ſubiection, for 
                        Vſe. Triall of integrity. herein lieth a maine difference betwixt the vpright, and the hypocrite; yea betwixt reſtraining and renewing grace. That reſtraining grace which is in many hypocrites ſtirreth them to doe many things which Chriſt commandeth, if at leaſt they croſſe not their honour, profit, eaſe, and the like. Herod that notorious hypocrite did many things. None that beareth the 
                        Mark. 6. 20. name of the Church, but will be ſubiect in ſomethings. But none but the vpright, who are indeed renewed by the ſanctifying ſpirit of Chriſt, will in all things make Chriſts will their rule, and in euery thing hold cloſe to it, preferring it before their pleaſure, profit, preferment, or any other outward allurement. They who ſo doe, giue good euidence that they are of the body of Chriſt, and may reſt vpon it, that Chriſt is their Sauiour.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 26. Of the ſumme of Husbands duties.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 25.
                  25. Husbands loue your Wiues, euen as Chriſt alſo loued the Church, and gaue himſelfe for it.
                  
               
               FRom Wiues duties the Apoſtle proceedeth to preſſe Huſbands duties. And as he propounded to Wiues for a patterne, the example of the Church, ſo to Husbands he propoundeth

the example of Chriſt: and 
                     Uerſ. 28, 29. addeth thereunto the patterne of a mans ſelfe, in regard of that naturall affection which he beareth to his body. Thus he addeth patterne to patterne, Husbands duties moſt preſſed. and doth the more largely and earneſtly preſſe them, becauſe husbands hauing a more honourable place, their failing in duty is the more hainous, ſcandalous, and dangerous.
               The Apoſtle reſtraineth the duties of Husbands to their 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  owne Wiues, as he did the duties of Wiues to their 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  owne Husbands. For though the ſame word be not here vſed which was before, yet a word of like emphaſis is vſed: and as good reaſon there is that our Engliſh tranſlators ſhould haue put in this particle (owne) in this verſe, as in the 22. verſe, for proofe whereof read 1 Cor. 7. 2. Where 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . See §. 82. theſe two words are vſed, and both of them tranſlated owne.
               
               This I haue the rather noted, becauſe many who hold that a Wife muſt haue but one Husband, conceit that a Husband may haue more Wiues then one: which conceit this particle (owne) wipeth away. All the duties of an Husband are compriſed vnder this one word See the reaſons hereof Treat. 4. §. 2. 
                  Loue. Wherein that an Husband might be the better directed, and whereto that he might be the rather prouoked, the forenamed example of Chriſt, and of his loue to the Church, is very liuely ſet forth: firſt generally in theſe words, euen as Chriſt loued the Church: and then more particularly in the words following.

                  Euen as) requireth no equality, as if it were poſſible for an Husband in that meaſure to loue his wife, as Chriſt loued his Church; (for as Chriſt in excellency and greatneſſe exceedeth man, ſo in loue and tenderneſſe) But it noteth an equity, and like quality.
               
               An equitie, becauſe there is as great reaſon that Husbands by vertue of their place ſhould loue their Wiues, as that Chriſt by vertue of his place ſhould loue the Church.
               A like quality, becauſe the loue which Chriſt beareth to the Church is euery way without exception: and a loue which turneth to the good and benefit of the Church. Hence note two points.
               
                  
1. Husbands muſt come as neare as they can to Chriſt in louing their wiues. In which reſpect, becauſe they can neuer loue ſo much as Chriſt did, they muſt neuer thinke they haue loued enough.
               2. Though their loue in meaſure cannot equall Chriſts loue, yet in the manner thereof it muſt be like Chriſts, a preuenting, true, free, pure, exceeding, conſtant loue.
               
               
                  The meaſure and manner of Chriſts loue is diſtinctly noted, Treat. 4. §. 61. &c. and the loue which an husband oweth his wife paralleld & applied therto, which application may be alſo made of that Chriſtian mutuall loue which we owe one to another.
               
               The loue of Chriſt to the Church is amplified,

                     1. By an Effect thereof, in theſe words, He gaue himſelfe for it.
                     
                     2. By the End of that effect, largely ſet downe, verſe 26, 27.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        The effect is noted partly as a
                        Confirmation of the truth
                        of Chriſts loue.
                     
                     
                        Declaration of the meaſure
                         
                         
                     
                  
               
               The Act (he gaue) ſheweth that his loue was in deed and truth: not only in ſhew and pretence.
               The Object (himſelfe) ſheweth that he loued his Church more then his owne life. A greater euidence of loue could not be giuen: for greater loue hath no man then this, that a man 
                  
                     Iohn 15. 13. 
                  lay downe his life for his friend.
               
               The end of Chriſts loue (ſet forth verſ. 26, 27.) is noted to ſhew that he ſo loued his Church for her good and happineſſe, rather then for any aduantage to himſelfe.
               As this example of Chriſts loue to his Church is ſet before husbands: ſo it may and ought alſo to be applied to all Chriſtians: and that in a double reſpect.
               1. As a motiue to ſtirre them vp to loue both Chriſt himſelfe, and alſo their brethren.
               2. As a patterne to teach them how to loue.
               A motiue it is to loue Chriſt, becauſe loue deſerueth loue: eſpecially ſuch a loue, of ſuch a perſon as the loue of Chriſt is. Yea, our loue of Chriſt is an euidence that we are loued of Chriſt, as ſmoake is a ſigne of fire. Wherefore both in thankfulneſſe to Chriſt, for his loue to vs, and for aſſurance to our owne ſoules of Chriſts loue to vs, we ought in all things that we can to teſtifie our loue to Chriſt.
               
                  
A motiue it is alſo to loue our brethren, becauſe Chriſt being in heauen, our 
                     Pſal. 16. 2. 
                  goodneſſe extendeth not to him: but our brethren on earth ſtand in his ſtead, and the loue we ſhew to them, we ſhew to him; and he accepteth it as done to him: 
                     Matth. 25. 35, 40. 
                  Ye fed me, yee viſited me, ſaith Chriſt to them that fed and viſited his brethren. This loue alſo, euen the 1 Joh. 4. 20. loue of our brethren, is an euidence that we are loued of God. Wherefore 
                     & verſ. 11. 
                  if Chriſt ſo loued vs, we ought alſo to loue one another.
               
               How the loue of Chriſt is a patterne, I will Treat 4 §. 61. &c.
                   afterwards ſhew.
            
            
               §. 28. Of Chriſts giuing himſelfe.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 25.
                  And gaue himſelfe for it.
               
               THis fruit and effect of Chriſts loue extendeth it ſelfe to all Chriſt himſelfe, and all that he did and ſuffered, are ours. the things that Chriſt did or ſuffered for our redemption: as, that he deſcended from heauen, tooke vpon him our nature, and became a man; that he ſubiected himſelfe to the law, and perfectly fulfilled it; that he made himſelfe ſubiect to many temptations of the deuill and his inſtruments; that he tooke vpon him our infirmities; that he became a King to gouerne vs, a Prophet to inſtruct vs, a Prieſt to make an attonement for vs: that he ſubiected himſelfe to death, the curſed death of the croſſe, and ſo made himſelfe an oblation & ſacrifice for our ſins; that he was buried; that he roſe againe; that he aſcended into heauen, and there ſitteth at Gods right hand to make interceſſion for vs. For after that Chriſt had taken vpon him to be our head and Sauiour, he wholly ſet himſelfe apart for our vſe, and our benefit: ſo as his perſon, his offices, his actions, his ſufferings, his humiliation, his exaltation, the dignitie, the puritie, the efficacie of all is the Churches, and to her good doe they all tend. This in generall is the extent of this fruit of Chriſts loue, he gaue himſelfe for it.
               
               
                  
More particularly, we may note theſe three points:

                     1. The action, what he did, (he gaue.)
                     
                     2. The obiect, what he gaue, (himſelfe.)
                     
                     3. The end, why he gaue himſelfe, (for it) for the Churches good.
                  
               
               The action hauing relation to the obiect, moſt eſpecially pointeth at the death of Chriſt. The

                     . Greeke word is a compound word, and ſignifieth to giue vp. It implieth two things,
               1. That Chriſt willingly died: the ſimple word (gaue) intimateth ſo much.
               2. That his death was an oblation: that is, a price of redemption, or a ſatisfaction: the compound word (gaue vp) intimateth ſo much.
            
            
               §. 29. Of the willingneſſe of Chriſt to die.
               
               That Chriſt willingly died is euident by the circumſtances noted about his death: when Peter counſelled him to ſpare himſelfe, and not to goe to Ieruſalem (where he was to be put to death) 
                     Mat. 16. 32, 23 he called him Satan, and ſaid, he was an offence to him: when Iudas went out to betray him, 
                     Iohn 13. 27. he ſaid vnto him, That thou doeſt, doe quickly: 
                  
                     & 18. 2. &c. Audiui, Domine, auditum tuū et expani, dum quaeris à quaerentibus quid quaerant, cùm noueris quod te quaerant: & dixiſti te eſſe leſum Nazarenū. Cypr. de Paſſ. Chriſti.
                   When Iudas was gone out to get companie to apprehend him, he went to the place where he was wont, ſo as Iudas might readily finde him; yea, he met them in the mid-way that came to take him; and he asked them whom they ſought, though he knew whom they ſought: and when they ſaid, Ieſus of Nazaret, he anſwered, I am he: When they came to him, he droue them all backward with a word of his mouth, and yet would not eſcape from them: 
                     Matth. 26. 53. He could haue praied to the Father to haue had more then twelue legions of Angels for his ſafeguard againſt thoſe that apprehended him, but would not: 
                     & 27. 42. when by his aduerſaries he was prouoked to haue come downe from the Croſſe, and could haue done ſo, he would not. 
                     Mark. 15. 39. At the inſtant of giuing vp the ghoſt, he cried with a loud voice: which ſheweth that his life was not then ſpent, he might haue retained it longer if he would: and thereupon the Centurion gathered that he was the Sonne of God. 
                     Iohn 2. 19. Matth. 28. 6. When he was actually dead, and laid in a graue, he roſe againe. Theſe & other like circumſtances verifie

that which Chriſt ſaid of himſelfe, 
                     Iohn 10. 18. Indicia dedit nullaſe neceſſita e, ſed obedientia vrgeri ad mortem. Cypr. de coen. Dom. Reaſon.
                   
                  No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it downe of my ſelfe. It was therefore no neceſſitie that compelled him to die, but his voluntarie obedience.
               Chriſt is 
                     Acts 3. 15. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  the Lord, Prince and Author of life, and hath an abſolute power as ouer the life of others, ſo ouer his owne life.
               Thus then we ſee that his ſacrifice was a voluntarie and free gift: the cauſe thereof was his owne will and good pleaſure.
               Exceedingly doth this commend the loue of Chriſt: and aſſureth vs that it is the more acceptable to God, who loueth a cheerefull giuer.

               §. 30. Of the kinde of Chriſts death, an oblation.
               
               That Chriſts death was an oblation, and a price of redemption, is euident by the death of thoſe beaſts which were offered vp for a ſacrifice, and therein were a type of Chriſts death. But expreſly is this noted by this Apoſtle, where he ſaith, 
                     Epheſ. 5. 2. 
                  Chriſt hath giuen himſelfe for vs, an offering and ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſauour: and againe, 1 Tim. 2. 6. 
                  Chriſt gaue himſelfe a ranſome. The phraſes of 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19 
                  redeeming, 
                  
                     Acts 20. 28. 
                  purchaeſing, 
                  2 Pet. 2. 1. 
                  buying, with the like, attributed to Chriſt and his bloud, doe further confirme the ſame.
               Learne hereby to conſider Chriſts death, not as the death of Vſe. a priuate man, but of a publike perſon, of a ſuertie, of a pledge, that in our roome and ſtead 2 Cor. 5. 21. 
                  was made ſinne, and 
                  
                     Gal. 3. 13. 
                  was made a curſe to redeeme vs from our ſinnes, and from the curſe which by ſinne was fallen vpon vs. The comfort and benefit of Chriſts death is loſt, if this be not knowne and beleeued. In this conſiſteth a maine difference betwixt the death of Chriſt, and all other men, not the moſt righteous Martyrs excepted. Their death was but a dutie, and debt: no ſatisfactory oblation, no price, no ranſome, as Chriſts was.
            
            
               §. 31. Of the infinite valew of the prince of our redemption.
               
               The Obiect, or thing which Chriſt gaue for a ranſome was himſelfe, not his body alone, nor his body and ſoule only,

but his perſon conſiſting of his two natures, humane, and diuine.
               
                  
                     Queſt. How could his diuine nature be giuen vp? could it How the perſon of Chriſt being Godman, was giuen for vs. ſuffer? could it die?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. The Deitie ſimply conſidered in and by it ſelfe, could not die: but that perſon which was God, both could and did die. For the Sonne of God aſſuming an humane nature into the vnity of his diuine nature, and vniting them together 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . Symbol. Calced.
                      
                     without confuſion, alteration, diſtraction, ſeparation, in one perſon, that which is done by one nature is done by the perſon, and in that reſpect the Scripture oft attributeth it to the other nature: as where it is ſaid, 1 Cor. 2. 8. 
                     They crucified the Lord of glorie: and 
                        Act. 20. 28. 
                     God purchaſed the Churchwith his owne bloud.
                  
                  2. Though the diuine nature of Chriſt ſuffered not, yet did it ſupport the humane nature, and adde dignity, worth and efficacie to the ſufferings of that nature.
                  3. Chriſts diuine nature had proper and peculiar workes in the worke of redemption, as to ſanctifie his humane nature, to take away our ſinnes, to reconcile vs to God, and the like.
                  Thus then in three reſpects the whole perſon of Chriſt was giuen vnto vs.
                  1. In regard of the inſeparable vnion of both natures.
                  2. In regard of the aſſiſtance of the Deity in thoſe things which the humane nature of Chriſt did.
                  3. In regard of ſome proper actions appertaining to the Deity. Doctr.
                  
                  In that the perſon of Chriſt God-Man was giuen vp, I gather that 1 Pet. 1. 19. Vſes.
                     
                  
                  
                     The price of our Redemption is of infinite value. Nor Chriſt, 
                        Quanta ſe fiducia ſpes credentium consolatur conſiderans quantus quanta pro nondum credentibus paſſus ſit? Aug. de Doctr. Chr. l. 1. c. 15. nor God himſelfe could giue a greater. Heauen and earth and all things in them are not of like worth. Well therefore might Saint Peter call it pretious bloud: and prefer it before ſiluer, gold, and all other things of price.
                  1. What place can be left for deſpaire in thoſe that know and beleeue the worth of this ranſome?
                  2. What can be held too deare for him, that notwithſtanding the infinite excellency of his perſon gaue himſelfe for vs?

can goods, can friends, can children, can liberty, can life, can any thing elſe?
                  3. What iuſt cauſe haue we to giue vp our ſelues a liuing ſacrifice, 
                     
                        Rom. 12. 1. 
                     holy and acceptable to him that gaue himſelfe for vs?
                  4. How vngratefull, how vnworthy of Chriſt are they, that for his ſake will not forſake their vnſtable honours, fading wealth, vaine pleaſures, gariſh attire, and ſuch like traſh?
               
            
            
               §. 32. Of Chriſts ſeeking the good of the Church.
               
               The End why Chriſt gaue himſelfe was, for the Church: ſo 
                  Doctr. 
                  as Chriſt in his death aimed at our good. 
                  2 Cor. 5. 21. He was made ſinne for vs, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him: 
                  
                     Gal. 3. 13. he was made a curſe for vs, and hath redeemed vs from the curſe of the Law: 
                  
                     Gal. 1. 4. he gaue himſelfe for our ſinnes, that he might deliuer vs: 
                  
                     Ioh. 10. 15. he laid downe his life for the ſheepe.
               
               This proues Chriſts giuing of himſelfe to be a fruit of his loue: for 1. Cor. 13. 5. 1. Vſe.
                   
                  Loue ſeeketh not her owne.
               
               Learne we hereby to apply all that Chriſt did to our ſelues. If for vs he gaue himſelf, he, and See §. 28. 2. Vſe.
                   all appertaining to him is ours.
               Learne we alſo hereby how to manifeſt loue: namely by ſeeking, and procuring the good of others. Let no man ſeeke his 
                  1 Cor. 10. 24. 
                  owne, but euery man anothers wealth. If this were practiſed, would there be ſuch oppreſſing, ſuch vndermining, ſuch deceiuing, ſuch wronging of one another as there is? Too truly is the Apoſtles complaint verified in our daies, All ſeeke their 
                  
                     Phil. 2. 21. 
                  owne. But let that minde be in vs which was in Chriſt Ieſus, and thus manifeſt our loue, as we deſire to partake of this fruit of Chriſts loue.
               From hence by iuſt conſequence it followeth that Chriſt merited 
                  Chriſt merited not for himſelfe. 
                  not for himſelfe. Was there any need that Chriſt ſhould come downe from heauen on earth, to purchaſe any thing for himſelfe? When he was going out of the world, thus he praied, Now, O Father, glorifie thou me with the glorie which I had 
                  
                     Ioh. 17. 5. 
                  with thee before the world was. Did Chriſt by any thing which he did on earth merit that glorie which he had before the world was? All the exaltation whereunto he was aduanced euen in his human nature, was due to the dignity of his perſon.
               
                  1. Obiect. He endured the croſſe, for the ioy which was ſet

                     before him.
                  
                  
                     
                     Anſw. He vſed that ioy which of right was due to him as an helpe to ſupport him in the weakneſſe of his humane nature, not as a recompence which he ſhould deſerue.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. He became obedient to the death of the Croſſe, 
                     
                        Phil. 2. 9. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . WHEREFORE God alſo hath highly exalted him.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. That particle (wherefore) doth not declare the cauſe, but the order of his exaltation: nothing a conſequence that followed after his death. After he had humbled himſelfe ſo low, he was moſt highly aduanced.
               
               
                  3. Obiect. Chriſt being man was bound to the Law: and therefore for himſelfe he ought to fulfill it.
                  
                     Anſw. If he had beene meere man, that were true. But he vniting his humane nature vnto his diuine, and making of both one perſon, which perſon was God as well as man, he was bound to nothing further then it pleaſed him voluntarily to ſubiect himſelfe vnto for our ſakes.
                  2. If Chriſt were bound to the Law, of dutie he muſt haue fulfilled it: and if of dutie he was to fulfill it, how could he thereby merit ſo high a degree of honour as he is aduanced vnto?
                  This conceit of Chriſts meriting for himſelfe, doth much extenuate the glorie of Chriſts grace and goodneſſe in giuing himſelfe.
               
            
            
               §. 33. Of the particular ends, why Chriſt gaue himſelfe, and of the condition of the Church before Chriſt tooke her.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 26.
                  That he might ſanctifie it, and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word.
               
               THe generall End of Chriſts giuing himſelfe being before intimated in this phraſe (for vs) is in this and the next verſe particularly exemplified: and that in two branches.
               One reſpecteth the eſtate of the Church in this world, v. 26.
               The other reſpecteth her eſtate in the world to come, v. 27.
               The latter of theſe two is the moſt principall.
               
                  
The former is ſubordinate to the latter, an end for the accompliſhing of the other end, for the Church is here made pure, that hereafter it may be made glorious.
               In laying downe the former he noteth

                     1. The end whereat Chriſt aimed.
                     2. The meanes, wherby he effected that which he aimed at.
                  
               
               That end is ſet forth in theſe words, that he might ſanctifie it, 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . See §. 39. 
                  hauing cleanſed it (thus may they word for word be tranſlated) ſo as that which for order of words is in the latter place, for order of matter is in the firſt place.
               The word (cleanſing) pointeth out our inſtification.
               
               The word (ſanctifying) expreſſeth our ſanctification.
               
               The meanes of effecting theſe, are two.

                     1. Baptiſme compriſed vnder this phraſe, waſhing of water.
                     
                     2. The word.
                     
                  
               
               The two branches of the former end, namely Cleanſing and Sanctifying doe in generall imply two things.

                     1. The Condition of the Church in it ſelfe.
                     2. The Alteration thereof by Chriſt.
                  
               
               The condition is preſuppoſed, which is, that ſhe was impure, polluted, in the common eſtate of corrupt man. Things in themſelues pure, are not cleanſed, but things foule and impure: perſons of themſelues freed, and exempted from a common miſery, need not anothers helpe to free and exempt them. Seeing then that the Church ſtood in need to be cleanſed, and ſanctified, ſurely
               
                  The Church in herſelfe was, as the world, polluted. Very liuely is Doctr. this ſet forth by the Prophet Ezekiel vnder the ſimilitude of a 
                  The Church in her ſelfe polluted. 
                  wretched infant borne of a curſed parentage, whoſe nauell was not cut, who was not waſhed, ſalted, nor ſwadled, but caſt out in the open field, polluted with bloud. Oft doth the Apoſtle, ſetting forth 
                     Ezek. 16. 3. &c.
                   the wretched eſtate of the world, note of the true members 
                     Eph. 2. 3. of the Church, that 
                     Tit. 3. 3. 
                  we our ſelues alſo were ſuch. 
                  1 Cor. 6. 11.
               
               The Church conſiſteth of none other then of ſuch as came out of Adams loines. Now as all the brood which commeth from vipers, adders, toads, ſpiders, and other like venomous dams, are infected with poiſon, ſo all the ſonnes of Adam are polluted with ſinne. That which is borne of the fleſh (as is euery

mothers childe, not the members of the Church excepted: for they haue fathers and mothers of their fleſh) is fleſh; that is, polluted and corrupt. Therefore when we are taken into the Church, we are borne againe. 
                  
                     Ioh. 3. 3, 5.
               
               
                  
                     
                        This our former eſtate by nature is oft and ſeriouſly Our naturall condition oft to be thought of. to be thought of, and that in reſpect of
                        Chriſt.
                     
                     
                        Our ſelues.
                         
                     
                     
                        Others.
                         
                     
                  
               
               1. In regard of Chriſt, the more to magnifie his loue. Our former eſtate, before he caſt the wings of his mercy vpon vs, ſheweth our vnworthineſſe, our vileneſſe, and wretchedneſſe, and in that reſpect it openeth our heart and mouth to thinke and ſay, 
                     Pſal. 8. 1, 4. 
                  O Lord our Lord, what is man that thou art mindfull of him, and the ſonne of man that thou viſiteſt him! 
                  
                     Ioh. 14. 22. 
                  Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelfe vnto vs, and not vnto the world! The right knowledge of our former eſtate, and a due conſideration thereof, maketh vs aſcribe all the glory of our preſent dignity, and happineſſe, to Chriſt that altered our eſtate, as Saint Paul, 
                  1 Tim. 1. 12. &c.
                   
                  I thanke Chriſt Ieſus our Lord who hath enabled mee, who was before a blaſphemer, &c. yea it maketh vs the more to prize and eſteeme the preſent eſtate, as 2 Sam. 7. 18, &c.
                   
                  Dauid.
               
               2. In regard of our ſelues this is to be thought of, to humble vs, and to keepe vs from inſolent boaſting in thoſe priuiledges whereof through Chriſt we are made partakers. To this purpoſe doth the Apoſtle thus preſſe this point, Who maketh 
                  1 Cor. 4. 7. 
                  thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou diddeſt not receiue? Now if thou diddeſt receiue it, why doeſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not receiued it? When a man is exalted from a meane, to a great place, and thereupon waxeth proud and inſolent, we ſay, he hath forgotten from whence he came. So as remembrance of our former condition is a meanes to preſerue humility, and to ſuppreſſe inſolencie.
               3. In regard of others it is to be thought of, to moue vs the more to commiſerate their wofull eſtate, who yet remaine as we once were; to conceiue hope that their eſtate may be altered as well as ours was; to pray and vſe what meanes we can that it may be altered. To prouoke Chriſtians to ſhew all meekeneſſe to them which were without, the Apoſtle

renders this reaſon, for we our ſelues alſo in times paſt were fooliſh, 
                  
                     Tit. 3 3, &c.
                   
                  &c.. read how forcibly this is vrged, Rom. 11. 18, 19, &c.
            
            
               §. 34. Of Chriſts preuenting Grace.
               
               In ſetting downe the alteration of the forenamed condition note

                     1. The manner of laying it forth.
                     2. The matter or ſubſtance thereof.
                  
               
               The manner is implied in this coniunction 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . THAT (That he might ſanctifie it) Chriſt loued the Church, and gaue himſelfe for it, not becauſe it was ſanctified, but that he might ſanctifie it: ſo as
               
                  The Grace which Chriſt ſheweth to the Church, is a preuenting 
                  Doct. 
                  Grace. Sanctification is no cauſe, but an effect of Chriſts 
                     Ipſe nos gratis ſaluos fecit, ipſe nos non eum quaerentes quaeſiuit, inuenit, &c. Aug. in Pſal. 78. loue: and followeth in order after his loue. His loue aroſe only and wholly from himſelfe: in the parties loued, there was nothing but matter of hatred before they were loued. Moſes thus ſaith of the loue of God to Iſrael, The Lord did not ſet his loue vpon you becauſe yee were more in number, but becauſe the Lord loued you. This at firſt ſight may ſeeme to be (as 
                     Non eſt inuenire Domino ſed praeuenire. Bern. ſerm. 78. in Cant.
                   we ſay) Idem per idem. 
                  a womans reaſon, that the Lord ſhould ſet his loue on them becauſe he loued them, but it being duly obſerued, we ſhall finde excellently ſet forth the ground of Gods loue to reſt altogether in himſelfe, and in his owne good pleaſure. 
                     Deut. 7. 7, 8. Yea this being noted as the end of Chriſts loue, that he might ſanctifie it, it further ſheweth that it was not any foreſight of holineſſe in the Church that moued him to loue it: firſt he loued it, and then ſought how to make it amiable, and worthy to be loued.
               Herein differeth Chriſts loue from the loue of all men towards Difference betwixt Chriſts loue and Mans. Eſt. 2 12, &c.
                   their ſpouſes: for they muſt ſee ſomething in them, to moue them to loue. When Ahaſh-veroſh was to chooſe a wife, the maidens out of whom he was to take one, were firſt purified, and then he tooke her in whom he moſt delighted: But Chriſt firſt loueth his ſpouſe, and then ſanctifieth it. Before he loued it, he ſaw nothing in it why he ſhould preferre it before the world.
               Seeing of him, and through him, and to him is all the beauty Vſe.
                  
and dignitie of the Church, the glorie be to him for euer, 
                  
                     Rom. 11. 36.

               §. 35. Of Chriſts ſeeking to make his Church pure.
               
               The Matter or ſubſtance of that ſubordinate end which Chriſt aimed at in giuing himſelfe for the Church, is in theſe words (that he might ſanctifie it hauing cleanſed it) which in generall ſhew that
               
                  Chriſt ſeeketh the purity of his Church. For this end hath he Doctr. ſhed his owne moſt pure and pretious bloud (for 
                  1 Ioh. 1. 7. 
                  his bloud cleanſeth vs from all ſinne) and conueyed his holy Spirit into his body the Church, which is called the 
                     Rom. 1. 4. 
                  Spirit of Sanctification, becauſe it reneweth and ſanctifieth thoſe in whom it is.
               This Chriſt aimeth at, that he might make his ſpouſe like to Reaſon. himſelfe, pure, as he is pure.
               That end which Chriſt aimed at, we that profeſſe our ſelues 1 Vſe. Exhortation. 1 Ioh. 3. 3. to be of this Church, muſt endeuour after: for euery man that hath this hope in him purgeth himſelfe as he is pure. Let vs therefore vſe all good meanes to cleanſe our ſelues from all filthineſſe of fleſh, and ſpirit.
               This being the end which Chriſt aimeth at for the good 2 Vſe. Triall. of his Church to cleanſe it, they who finde themſelues cleanſed haue a good euidence that they are of this Church: they who are not cleanſed can haue no aſſurance thereof.
               How vnworthy are they of this benefit, that liue as the 3 Vſe. Reproofe. world, and like ſwine vpon euery occaſion wallow in the mire, being drawne by euery temptation into ſinne? Doe they not, as much as in them lieth, make the death of Chriſt to be in vaine, and peruert that maine end, which Chriſt aimed at in giuing himſelfe?
               But what may be thought of ſuch as Iſmael-like mocke and ſcoffe at thoſe that labour to be cleanſed?
            
            
               §. 36. Of the Churches Iuſtification.
               
               The two particular parts of the forenamed end, which are Cleanſing, and ſanctifying, doe more diſtinctly ſet forth the puritie of the Church euen in this world. Cleanſing hath relation to the bloud of Chriſt, and ſo pointeth out our Iuſtification.
               
               
                  
                  Sanctifying hath relation to the Spirit of Chriſt, which worketh our Sanctification.
               From this cleanſing of the Church here meant, I gather, that No ſinne lieth vpon the Church: for the bloud of Chriſt purgeth 
                  Doctr. 
                  from all ſinne. This is to be taken of the guilt of ſin, which 1 Ioh. 1. 7. by Chriſts death is cleane taken away: ſo as that ſinne which is in vs, is as not in vs, becauſe it is not imputed vnto vs.
               Behold here the bleſſed eſtate of the Church, for, Bleſſed is 
                  Vſe. 
                  he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiuen, whoſe ſinne is couered. Bleſſed 
                  
                     Pſal. 32. 1, 2. 
                  is the man vnto whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne.
               
            
            
               §. 37. Of the Churches Sanctification.
               
               From the ſanctifying of the Church here mentioned, I further gather, that
               
                  The Church is made holy and righteous: This is here meant of Doctr. that inherent righteouſneſſe which the Spirit of Chriſt worketh in all the members of his body. In which reſpect they are called Saints: ſo as not only the guilt of ſinne is taken away, 1 Cor. 1. 2. but alſo the very body of ſinne is ſo deſtroied in them, as it can 
                     Rom. 6. 6. no more raigne in them, nor they obey it in the luſts thereof: but in ſtead of the dominion of ſinne the ſpirit of Chriſt raigneth in them, and leadeth them vnto all righteouſneſſe.
               Behold here the free eſtate of the Church: whereas the Vſe. world lieth vnder the ſlauerie of ſinne, and tyrannie of Satan, the Church is made free from ſinne, and a ſeruant of righteouſneſſe: 
                  
                     Rom. 6. 18, 11. 
                  dead to ſinne, and aliue to God in Ieſus Chriſt.
               
            
            
               §. 38. Of the Churches purity before God and Man.
               
               From the Connexion of theſe two benefits of Chriſts death, Iuſtification and Sanctification together, we ſee that The Church is both ſpotleſſe before God and blameleſſe before men. The bloud of Chriſt ſo cleanfeth her as in Gods ſight ſhe hath no ſpot of ſinne: and the ſpirit of Chriſt ſo ſanctifieth her, as her righteouſneſſe ſhineth before men: for the Grace of God 
                  
                     Tit. 2. 11, 12. 
                  teacheth her to denie vngodlineſſe, and worldly luſts, and to liue ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world. In this reſpect the Church is ſaid to be all glorious within, and her 
                  
                     Pſal. 45. 13. 
                  clothing alſo to be of wrought gold. And Zacharias and Elizabet, 
                  
                     Luk. 1. 6. members of this Church, are ſaid to be righteous before God, and blameleſſe, namely before men. There is no ſuch

purity in any, as in the Church. For true and perfect beautie 
                     Vera & perfecta pulcl. ritudo in nullo hominum eſt niſi in corpore Chriſti quod interpretatur Eccleſia. Hier. in Ezech. 27. is onely in the body of Chriſt, which is the Church, whereof it is ſaid, Thou art all faire, and there is no ſpot in thee, Cant. 4. 7.
               
                  1. Queſt. Is it poſſible that neither God nor man ſhould eſpie any fault in thoſe that are of the true Church, while here they liue in this world?
                  
                     Anſw. Seeing the fleſh remaineth in the beſt while they remaine Sinne is in the beſt. in the world, it is not poſſible but that both God and man muſt needs eſpie many blemiſhes in the beſt. All things are 
                     
                        Heb. 4. 13. 
                     naked and opened to the eyes of God: if therefore any remnant of ſinne be in the Saints (as there are exceeding many in euerie one; ſo as if we ſay that we haue no ſinne we deceiue our ſelues, 
                     1 Job. 1. 8. 
                     and the truth is not in vs) it is without queſtion manifeſt in his ſight. Yea ſuch is the imperfection and weakneſſe of the beſt Saints, as the fleſh continually luſting in them againſt the Spirit, oft times preuaileth, and ſo ſheweth it ſelfe in ſome euill fruit or other, as the eye of man eſpieth it: inſtance the examples of the beſt that euer liued in any age.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. How then are they ſpotleſſe before God, and How the Saints are ſpotleſſe before God. blameleſſe before men?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. God ſo fully diſchargeth and acquitteth the Church of all her ſinnes, as ſhe is in his account as if ſhe had no ſpecke of ſinne at all. Dauid in this reſpect vſeth the metaphor of couering ſinne, and explaineth his meaning by theſe two 
                        Pſal 32. 1, 2. phraſes, forgiuing, not imputing ſinne.
                  
                  2. The courſe of a mans life, not this or that particular How the Saints are blameleſſe before men. Vna hirundo non facit ver.
                      action, is it which maketh a man blame-worthie, or blameleſſe: as the flocke of ſwallowes, and not one here, or another there, is it which ſheweth the Spring. Now becauſe the conſtant carriage of thoſe who are of the Church is before men blameleſſe, they may iuſtly be ſo accounted, notwithſtanding ſome particular things blame-worthie doe ſometimes paſſe from them. Behold here how the true Saints may boldly lift vp their faces before God and man. The ſoundneſſe of their faith cauſeth confidence before God. The teſtimonie of their conſcience cauſeth courage before men. Let all that deſire this boldneſſe, ioyne a ſound faith and a good conſcience together, and

labour for aſſurance both of their cleanſing by the bloud of Chriſt, and ſanctifying by the Spirit of Chriſt.
               
            
            
               §. 39. Of the order and dependance of iuſtification and ſanctification one vpon another.
               
               The order and manner of knitting theſe two benefits together is worthie to be noted.
               The letter ſetteth ſanctification in the firſt place: but the ſenſe preſuppoſeth iuſtification: for thus he ſaith, that he might ſanctifie it, 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  hauing cleanſed it. Becauſe the cleanſing here ſpoken of is an inward inuiſible worke, and the euidence thereof is ſanctification, which is an outward and ſenſible worke, therefore this is firſt expreſſed, and then that inferred, as a matter neceſſarily to be preſuppoſed.
               Hence ariſe theſe Doctrines. Our Engliſh with this particle (hauing) doth fitly and properly expound the Greeke actiue participles of the Praeterperfect or finite tenſes, which becauſe the Latines want, they are faine to vſe the paſſiue, or a Periphraſis: as, vt illam ſanctificaret mundatam, Eraſm. Poſtquam eam purgaſſet, Beza.
               
               1. Iuſtification in order goeth before 1. Doct. Iuſtificatio non accedit factoribus ſed factores legis praecedit. Aug. de Spir. & lit. cap. 26. ſanctification: I ſay in order, becauſe at that verie moment that Chriſt by his bloud cleanſeth his Church, he beginneth to ſanctifie her: but when he beginneth to ſanctifie her, he hath cleanſed her, ſhe is iuſtified.
               The grace then of iuſtification is a moſt free grace: it is not wrought vpon any righteouſneſſe of ours: for it is before it.
               2. Chriſt ſanctifieth thoſe whom he hath cleanſed. This the 2. Doct.
                   Apoſtle copiouſly proueth in the ſixth chapter to the Romans. Let none therefore boaſt of their cleanſing by Chriſts bloud, till they finde themſelues renewed and ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt. For note the Apoſtles deſcription of thoſe who are iuſtified by Chriſt, which for more perſpicuitie may thus be ſet downe by queſtion and anſwer. To whom is there no condemnation? 
                     Rom. 8. 1. To them that are in Chriſt Ieſus. Who are they? They who walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.
               
               3. Sanctification preſuppoſeth iuſtification: they who are ſanctified 3. Doct.
                   may reſt vpon it, that they are cleanſed and iuſtified.
               
                  
For ſanctification is a fruit of iuſtification, in which reſpect S. Iames ſaith, that we are iuſtified by works, that is, declared ſo 
                     Iam. 2. 24. to be.
               Admirable is the comfort which the Saints in this world Uſe. reape hereby. For their ſanctification being imperfect, and the fleſh abiding in them, and luſting againſt the Spirit: yea ſinne being preſent with them when they would doe good, they are oft forced to complaine and crie, O wretched m
                        •
                     n that we are: 
                  
                     Rom. 7. 24. 
                  who ſhall deliuer vs from this bodie of death! If they had no other ground to faſten the anchor of their hope vpon but their ſanctification, it could not hold them faſt enough againſt the tempeſts of Satans temptations. But in that their ſanctification is a fruit and euidence of their iuſtification, they take heart to themſelues, and thanke God that with the minde they themſelues ſerue the Law of God, though with the fleſh the law of ſinne. And thus vpheld and comforted, they continue to ſtriue againſt ſinne, till it be cleane rooted out of them, as well as remitted.
            
            
               §. 40. Of Sacramentall waſhing of water.
               
               One of the meanes which Chriſt vſeth for the cleanſing and ſanctifying of his Church, is expreſſed vnder this phraſe, with the waſhing of water. Water is the outward element vſed in Baptiſme: Waſhing is the principall Sacramentall rite therein. Water ſetteth forth Chriſts bloud: Waſhing noteth out the application and efficacie thereof, which is the purging and cleanſing of our ſoules. As water without waſhing maketh nothing cleane: ſo the bloud of Chriſt, without a right application thereof, cleanſeth no mans ſoule.
               This waſhing of water here mentioned, being applied to an inward ſpirituall cleanſing, what can it elſe ſet forth but the Sacrament of Baptiſme, wherein both water and waſhing is vſed?
               
                  Obiect.
                  There is but little waſhing vſed in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, nothing but ſprinkling a little water on the face of the partie that is baptized.
                  
                     Anſw. That ſprinkling is ſufficient to ſhew the vſe of water. Why water in baptiſme is but ſprinkled. The partie to be baptized is not brought to the Font to haue

his face, or any other part of his bodie made cleane, but to haue aſſurance of the inward cleanſing of his ſoule. Now that our mindes may not too much dote on the outward thing done, but be wholly raiſed vp to the myſterie, the outward element is no further vſed, then may ſerue to put vs in minde of the inward thing ſignified thereby: anſwerably in the Lords Supper there is not ſo much bread and wine giuen and receiued, as would ſatisfie ones appetite, or ſlake his hunger and quench his thirſt, but only a little bit of bread, and taſte of wine, to declare the vſe of bread and wine, and ſo to draw the mindes of the Communicants to a conſideration of their ſpirituall nouriſhment by the bodie and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt.
               
            
            
               §. 41. How Baptiſme is a meanes of cleanſing and ſanctifying.
               
               The manner of inferring this Sacramentall waſhing vpon the ſanctifying and cleanſing of the Church thus, with the waſhing of water, ſheweth, that
               
                  Baptiſme is a meanes of ſanctifying and cleanſing the Church. All Doctr. thoſe places of Scripture that attribute

                     1. In what reſpect Baptiſme is a meanes of our ſanctifying and cleanſing.
                     2. What kinde of meanes it is.
                     3. How neceſſarie it is.
                  
               
               In foure eſpeciall reſpects it may be ſaid to be a meanes as aforeſaid.
               1. In that it doth moſt liuely repreſent and ſet forth euen to the outward ſenſes the inward cleanſing of our ſoules by the bloud of Chriſt, and ſanctifying of vs by the Spirit of Chriſt. Apply the vſe of water (by the waſhing whereof foule things are made verie cleane) to the vertue of Chriſts bloud and efficacie of his Spirit, and the truth hereof will euidently appeare. For the better helpe in this application, read Rom. 6. 4. &c.
               2. In that it doth truly propound and make tender, or offer of the grace of iuſtification and ſanctification to the partie

baptized. In this reſpect it is thus deſcribed, Baptiſme of repentance 
                  
                     Luke 3. 3. 
                  for remiſſion of ſinnes: and S. Peter to like purpoſe ſaith, 
                     Acts 2. 38. 
                  Repent, and be baptized euerie one of you for the remiſſion of ſins.
               
               3. In that it doth really exhibit and ſeale vp to the conſcience of him that is baptized the forenamed graces, whereby he is aſſured that he is made partaker thereof. Thus Abraham receiued the ſigne of circumciſion as a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of 
                  
                     Rom 4. 11. 
                  faith. Hence is it that the Eunuch and others when they were 
                     Acts 8. 39. & 16. 34. 
                  baptized, went away reioycing.
               
               4. In that it is a particular and peculiar pledge to the partie baptized, that euen he himſelfe is made partaker of the ſaid graces: therefore euerie one in particular is baptized for himſelfe: yea, though many be at once brought to the Font, yet euerie one by name is baptized. To this purpoſe faith the Apoſtle, Whoſoeuer are baptized into Chriſt, haue put on Chriſt; 
                  
                     Gal. 3. 27. 
                  whoſoeuer, whether Peter, Iohn, Thomas, or any other particular perſon. Ananias ſaid to Paul in the ſingular number, Be 
                  
                     Acts 22. 16. 
                  thou baptized, and waſh away thy ſinnes.
               
            
            
               §. 42. Obiections againſt the efficacie of baptiſme anſwered.
               
               
                  1. Obiect. Many that are baptized receiue no ſuch grace at all, they are neither cleanſed nor ſanctified.
                  
                     Anſw. They are only outwardly waſhed with water, they are not baptized with the Holy Ghoſt. The fault is not in that no grace accompanieth that Sacrament, but in that they receiue not, but reiect the grace which appertaineth thereto: what if ſome beleeue not? ſhall their vnbeleefe make the faith of 
                     
                        Rom. 3. 3. 
                     God without effect? God forbid.
                  
               
               
                  2. Obiect. Many receiue the forenamed graces before they are baptized, as Abraham before he was circumcized, and ſuch 
                        Rom. 411. as were baptized after they beleeued. How then is baptiſme a meanes thereof?
                  
                     Anſw. Their ſpirituall cleanſing is more liuely and fully manifeſted thereby, and they the more aſſured thereof.
               
               
                  3. Obiect. Many who long after their baptiſme, haue liued like ſwine in ſinne, and ſo haue not beene cleanſed or ſanctified, yet diuers yeeres after haue beene effectually called: what meanes hath baptiſme beene hereof?
                  
                     Anſw. The vſe and efficacie of baptiſme is not as the act

thereof, tranſient, but permanent and perpetuall ſo long as the partie baptized liueth. Whenſoeuer a ſinner vnfainedly repenteth, and faithfully laieth hold on the promiſes of God, baptiſme, which is the ſeale thereof is as powerfull and effectuall as it could haue beene when it was firſt adminiſtred. For the efficacie of baptiſme conſiſteth in the free offer of grace. So long therefore as God continueth to offer grace, ſo long may a mans baptiſme be effectuall. On this ground we are but once for all baptized: and as the 
                        Ier. 44. Prophets put the people in minde of their circumciſion, ſo the Apoſtles of their baptiſme long after it was adminiſtred. Yea, they ſpeake of it (though the act were long before paſt) as if it were in doing, in the time preſent, Baptiſme ſaueth. 
                     1 Pet. 3. 21.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 43. What kinde of meanes of grace Baptiſme is.
               
               II. Baptiſme is no phyſicall or naturall meanes of working 
                     Aqua exhibet forinſecus Sacramentum gratiae, & Spiritus operatur intrinſecus beneficium gratiae. Aug. Epiſt. 23. grace, as if the grace which is ſealed vp thereby were inherent in the water, or in the Miniſters act of ſprinkling it (as in medicines, ſalues, hearbs, meats, and the like, there is inherent that vertue which proceedeth from the vſe of them: and being applied, they haue their operation, whether a man beleeue it, or no) but it is only a voluntarie inſtrument which Chriſt vſeth, as it pleaſeth him, to worke what grace, or meaſure of 
                     In Baptiſmo praecipua pars eſt Spiritus, per quem & aqua ſit efficax. Chryſ. in Act. Hom. 1. grace ſeemeth beſt to him: ſo as grace is only aſſiſtant to it, not included in it: yet in the right vſe thereof, Chriſt by his Spirit worketh that grace which is receiued by it, in which reſpect the Miniſter is ſaid to baptize with water, but Chriſt with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire, Matth. 3. 11.
            
            
               §. 44. Of the neceſſitie of Baptiſme.
               
               III. A meanes of working a thing may be ſaid to be neceſſarie Things neceſſarie two wayes. two wayes.
               1. Abſolutely, ſo as the thing cannot poſſibly be without it. Ex Hypotheſi. Thus are the proper cauſes of a thing abſolutely neceſſarie, as in this caſe, Gods couenant, Chriſts bloud, and the operation of the Spirit, are abſolutely neceſſarie for attaining any grace.
               2. By conſequence, ſo as according to that courſe and order which God hath ſet downe, things cannot be without them.
               Baptiſme is not abſolutely neceſſarie as a cauſe: for then ſhould it be equall to Gods couenant, Chriſts bloud, and the

worke of the Spirit. Yea then ſhould all that are baptized without any exception be cleanſed.
               
               But it is by conſequence neceſſarie: and that in a double Exhypotheſi. reſpect.

                     1. In regard of Gods ordinance.
                     2. In regard of our need thereof.
                  
               
               1. God hauing ordained this a Sacrament to be vſed, it is neceſſarie it ſhould be vſed, if for no other end, yet for manifeſtation of our obedience. He that careleſly neglecteth; or wilfully contemneth any Sacrament which God ſhall enioyne him to vſe, his ſoule ſhall be cut off. 
                  
                     Gen. 17. 14.
               
               2. Great is the need that we haue thereof, in regard of our dulneſſe in conceiuing things ſpirituall, and of our weakneſſe in beleeuing things inuiſible. We are carnall, and earthly: and by things ſenſible and earthly, doe the better conceiue things ſpirituall and heauenly: therefore hath God ordained viſible elements to be Sacraments of inuiſible graces. Againe we are ſlow to beleeue ſuch things as are promiſed in the word, therefore the more to helpe and ſtrengthen our faith, God hath added to his couenant in the word, his ſeale in and by the Sacrament: that by two immutable things, (Gods couenant and Gods ſeale) in which it is impoſſible for God to lie, we might haue ſtrong conſolation. Beſides, though in generall we doe beleeue the truth of Gods word, yet we are doubtfull to apply it to our ſelues: wherefore for better applying Gods couenant to our owne ſoule, God hath added his Sacrament to his word.
            
            
               §. 45. Of the contrarie extremes of Papiſts and Anabaptiſts about the neceſſitie and efficacie of Baptiſme.
               
               There are two extremes contrarie to the forenamed points about baptiſme.
               One in the exceſſe, which is of Papiſts that attribute too much thereunto, and make it a plaine Idoll.
               Another in the defect, of Anabaptiſts and Libertines, which Papiſts attribute too much to Baptiſme. Bellarm. de Bapt lib. 1. cap. 4. derogate too much from it, and make it an idle ceremonie.
               
                  
                     
                        In two things doe Papiſts exceed,
                        1. In the neceſſitie
                        Of Baptiſme.
                     
                     
                        2. In the efficacie
                         
                         
                     
                  
               
               They make it ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as if any die vnbaptized

A mercileſſe ſentence without any warrant of Gods word: yea againſt his word & againſt the order which he hath preſcribed. He hath eſtabliſhed 
                     Gen. 17. 7. his couenant, & promiſed to be the God of the faithfull & of their ſeed: on which ground S. Peter ſaith, The promiſe is vnto 
                  
                     Acts 2. 39. 
                  you & vnto your children: & S. Paul ſaith, your children are holy.

                     Gen. 17. 12. Joſ. 5. 5. of baptiſme? if ſo, would God haue enioyned circumciſion (which to the Iewes was as baptiſme is to Chriſtians) to be put off to the eighth day, before which day many infants died? or would Moſes haue ſuffered it to be forborne all the time that the Iſraelites were in the wilderneſſe? If it be ſaid that baptiſme is more neceſſarie then circumciſion, I anſwer, the Scripture layeth no more neceſſitie vpon it. If it were ſo neceſſarie as they make it, then the vertue of Chriſts death were leſſe effectuall ſince he was actually exhibited then before. For before it was effectuall for infants without a Sacrament, but belike not now. Had the ancient Churches conceiued ſo of the abſolute neceſſitie of baptiſme, they would not haue had ſet times for the adminiſtring thereof: nor ſuffered it to be put off ſo long as they did.

Spirit; and the vſe of faith, repentance, and ſuch like graces. What can there be more in the water of baptiſme, then was in the bloud of ſuch beaſts as were offered vp for ſacrifices? But it is not poſſible that the bloud of Buls and Goats ſhould take away ſin. 
                  
                     Heb. 10. 4. They themſelues attribute no ſuch efficacie to the word preached, and yet they cannot ſhew where the holy Ghoſt hath giuen more vertue to baptiſme, then to the word. This text ioyneth them both together (that he might cleanſe it with 
                  1 Cor. 1. 21. Rom. 1. 16. 
                  the waſhing of water through the word) What can be more ſaid of a meanes then that which is ſaid of the word? It pleaſed God by preaching to ſaue them that beleeue. The Goſpell is the power of God to ſaluation, &c.
               
               On the other ſide, Anabaptiſts, and ſuch like Libertines, too Anabaptiſts extenuate baptiſme too much. lightly eſteeme this holy and neceſſary ordinance of God, in that they make it only a badge of our profeſſion, a note of difference betwixt the true and falſe Church, a ſigne of mutuall fellowſhip, a bare ſigne of ſpirituall grace, a reſemblance of mortification, regeneration, inſcition into Chriſt, with the like, but no more: Theſe indeed are ſome of the ends and vſes of Baptiſme: But in that they reſtraine all the efficacy thereof hereunto, they take away the greateſt comfort, and trueſt benefit which the Church reapeth thereby, as may be gathered out of the points noted §. 41. before.

               In that with this waſhing of water, Chriſt cleanſeth his Church, I obſerue that
               
                  Whoſoeuer are fully baptiſed are cleanſed from ſinne.
               
               
                  Fully, that is, powerfully and effectually, as well inwardly by the Spirit, as outwardly by the Miniſter.
               
                  Cleanſed, both from the guilt of ſinne by Chriſts bloud, and from the power of ſinne by the worke of his Spirit.
               To this purpoſe tend the many emphaticall phraſes attributed by the Apoſtles to Baptiſme, as that we are baptiſed into Ieſus Chriſt, baptiſed into his death, buried with him by baptiſme; that Baptiſme doth ſaue vs; that Baptiſme is the waſhing of regeneration, 
                  
                     Rom. 6. 3, 4. 1 Pet. 3. 21. Tit. 3 5. with the like.
               Vaine is the reioycing of many, who boaſt of their baptiſme, Vſe. and thinke themſelues by vertue thereof to be as good Chriſtians

as the beſt, and yet liue and lie in their ſinne, being more beſmeered and defiled therewith then they were, when they were firſt borne. Iohn ſaith, Chriſt baptiſcth with the holy Ghoſt

If that fire of the holy Ghoſt burne not vp the droſſe of ſinne in thee, and this water waſh not away the filth of ſinne, thou wert neuer: fully baptiſed. It may be the hand of ſome Miniſter hath ſprinkled a little water on thy face, but Chriſts bloud hath not as yet beene ſprinkled on the ſoule: all the benefit which thou reapeſt by thy baptiſme is, that another day thou ſhalt dearely anſwer for the abuſe of ſo honourable an ordinance.
            
            
               §. 47. Of ioyning the word with Baptiſme.
               
               The other meanes of ſanctifying and cleanſing the Church here expreſſed, is the word. This being applied vnto Baptiſme, and ioyned with it, muſt needs be meant of the promiſe of Grace ſealed vp in Baptiſme, which is Gods promiſe of iuſtifying vs freely and ſanctifying vs effectually, plainly made knowne and truly beleeued: This meanes being thus added to this Sacrament, we may well inferre that
               
                  It is neceſſary that the word and Baptiſme goe together: that Doct. where this Sacrament is adminiſtred, the doctrine thereof be truly, plainly, intelligibly taught, ſo as the nature, efficacy, end, and vſe thereof may be made knowne; and the couenant of God ſealed vp thereby, beleeued. So ſaith Chriſt, 
                     Mat. 28. 19. 
                  Goe teach all nations baptiſing them. So did the 
                     Luk. 3. 3. Baptiſt, and the 
                     Act. 2. 38. & 8. 12, 37. & 10. 47. & 16. 15, 33. Apoſtles, they preached the Goſpell to them whom they baptiſed.
               1. A Sacrament without the word is but an idle ceremony: 
                     Reaſons. Detrahe verbum & quid eſt aqua niſi aqua? accedat verbum ad clementum & fit ſacramentum. Aug. in Ioh. 15. tract. 80. no more then a ſeale without a couenant: for it is the word that maketh knowne the couenant of God.
               2. It is the word which maketh the greateſt difference betwixt the ſacramentall waſhing of water, and ordinary common waſhing.
               3. By the word the ordinary creatures which we vſe are ſanctified, much more the holy ordinances of God, whereof Baptiſme is one of the principall.
               
                  
                     Queſt. Is it not then lawfull to adminiſter Baptiſme without 1 Tim. 4. 5. a Sermon?
                  
                     
                     Anſw. Though it be a very commendable, and honourable manner of adminiſtring that Sacrament, then to adminiſter it when the word is preached, yet I thinke not a Sermon at that time to be ſo neceſſary, as it ſhould be vnlawfull without one, to adminiſter Baptiſme. For the ioyning of the word and Sacrament here ſpoken of is, that they who are baptiſed, or who preſent children to be baptiſed, and anſwer for them, or are preſent at the adminiſtring of Baptiſme, or liue in the places where it vſeth to be adminiſtred, ſhould be inſtructed in the Goſpell, and taught the couenant which Baptiſme ſealeth vp. Beſides, the liturgie and publike forme preſcribed for the adminiſtring of Baptiſme both in our Church and other reformed Churches, laieth downe the nature, efficacy, end, vſe, and other like points appertaining to that Sacrament, & plainly declareth the couenant of God ſealed vp thereby: ſo as in our and other like Churches where ſuch formes are preſcribed to be alwaies vſed, the word is neuer ſeparated from Baptiſme, though at the adminiſtring of Baptiſme there be no Sermon.
                  The Church of Rome doth directly tranſgreſſe againſt the Papiſts ioyne not the word and ſeale. forenamed rule of ioyning the word and Baptiſme together. For though they haue a publike forme preſcribed, yet it being in an vnknowne tongue, not vnderſtood of the people, nor expounded to them, it is all one as if there were no forme at all, no word at all: for that which is not vnderſtood is all one 1 Cor. 14. 9. &c.
                      as if it were not vttered.
                  Much more hainous is their tranſgreſſion who liue vnder the Goſpell, where it is preached plainly to the vnderſtanding and capacity of the meaneſt, and yet are careleſſe in comming to it, or in attending vnto it, and ſo remaine as ignorant as if they liued in places where the word is not preached at all, or in an vnknowne tongue. Such ignorant perſons if they were not baptiſed are not worthy while they remaine ſo ignorant to be baptiſed, nor yet to preſent their children to be baptiſed, or to be preſent at the baptiſme of others. As Miniſters that baptiſe ought to preach the word, ſo ought they who are baptiſed to be inſtructed in the word.
               
            
            
               
               §. 48. Of the Inference of Glorification vpon Iuſtification and Sanctification.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 27.
                  That he might preſent it to himſelfe a glorious Church, &c.
               
               THe moſt principall end, in regard of the Churches good, which Chriſt aimed at when he gaue himſelfe for her, is her glorious eſtate in heauen: this is the end of the forenamed end. For why did Chriſt giue himſelfe for the Church? That he might ſanctifie it, hauing cleanſed it: why did he cleanſe, and ſanctifie it? That he might preſent it to himſeife a glorious Church. Hence note theſe three points.

                     1. Iuſtification and ſanctification muſt goe before glorification.
                     
                     2. The end why the Saints are cleanſed and ſanctified in this world, is that they may be preſented glorious to Chriſt in the world to come.
                     
                     3. The only meanes to make vs glorious before Chriſt our ſpouſe is righteouſneſſe.
                     
                  
               
               1. All thoſe places of Scripture which ſet our righteouſneſſe in this world before our glory in the world to come (as 
                     Tit. 2. 12, 13. 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. very many places doe) doe proue the firſt point, that Iuſtification and Sanctification muſt goe before Glorification. Among Men muſt be iuſtified and ſanctified before they can be glorified. Rom. 8. 30. other proofes note eſpecially the order of the ſeuerall linkes of that golden chaine that reacheth from Gods eternall counſell before the world, vnto our euerlaſting glory after this world, Whom he did predeſtinate them he alſo called; and whom he called them he alſo iuſtified; and whom he iuſtified them he alſo glorified.
               
               1. Heauen, the place of our glorification, is an holy Citie, 
                  
                     Reaſons. Reu. 21. 10, 27. 
                  whereinto no vncleane thing ſhall enter.
               
               2. In that place the Church is to be maried vnto Chriſt, and to be euer with him: ſhe muſt therefore be pure as he is 
                  1 Ioh. 3. 2, 3. 
                  pure: for he will not endure the ſociety of a foule filthy ſpouſe.
               As we deſire aſſurance of our glorification in heauen, ſo Vſe. let vs get, and giue euidence of our iuſtification and ſanctification on earth. The euidence of our iuſtification is a ſound and true faith. The euidence of our ſanctification is a good and cleare conſcience.
               
                  
The forenamed proofes and reaſons doe alſo confirme the We are here cleanſed that we might be hereafter glorified. ſecond point, that The end why the Saints are cleanſed and ſanctified in this world is, that they may be preſented glorious to Chriſt in the world to come.
               
               It is therefore needfull and behouefull, not only in regard of 
                     Ex co quod hic accipit Eccleſia ad illam gloriam quae hic non eſt, perfectionemque perducitur. Aug. Retract. l. 1. c 7. Chriſts honour, but alſo of our owne glory and happineſſe, that here while we liue on earth we be ſanctified and cleanſed. If Chriſt for our ſakes had an eie at our future and euerlaſting glory, and for that end prepared meanes to bring vs thereunto, ought not we ourſelues much rather haue an eie thereat, and both auoid all things which may hinder it, and vſe all meanes whereby we may be aſſured of it? Moſes had reſpect vnto the recompence of the reward. Yea Chriſt for the ioy which 
                  
                     Heb. 11. 26. & 12. 2. 
                  was ſet before him endured the croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame.
               
               3. That Righteouſneſſe is the only meanes to make vs glorious 
                  Righteouſnes the only meanes to make vs glorious. 
                  before Chriſt our ſpouſe, is euident by this, that Chriſt gaue himſelfe to worke and effect this meanes for this end. Chriſt himſelfe by his death, hath conſecrated this, and no other meanes. If there be any other meanes then that which Chriſt by offering vp himſelfe hath procured, what need Chriſt to haue beene offered vp? To ſhew that this is the meanes to make the Church glorious before Chriſt, the holy Ghoſt reſembleth the righteouſneſſe of the Saints to fine linnen, cleane, and white, 
                  
                     Reu. 19. 7, 8. wherewith the wife of the Lambe is made ready againſt the day of mariage.
               Chriſt himſelfe loueth righteouſneſſe and hateth wickedneſſe: 
                  
                     Reaſon. Pſal. 45. 7. they therefore, and none but they that are araied with righteouſneſſe, are glorious in his eies.
               This I haue the rather noted againſt the conceit of our aduerſaries, Vſe. who place all the glory of the Church in outward Papiſts place the glory of the Church in outward pompe. pompe. Wherefore their Pope whom they make head of the Church, and after a peculiar manner the ſpouſe of Chriſt, muſt haue his triple crowne, his ſcarlet robes, his throne aduanced aboue kings: Men muſt be his horſes to beare him: and Kings and Nobles muſt be his men to wait on him. Their Prieſts alſo muſt be araied with glorious copes of the beſt wrought gold. Their temples muſt be decked with curious, carued, gilded images. Their hoaſt caried about in

manner of a triumph. Their people all beſprinkled with water. Their ſuperſtitious houſes muſt be the faireſt buildings in a kingdome, and haue the greateſt reuenues of a kingdome belonging to them: with the like. Dionyſius Ioui Olympio aureum amiculum detraxit, laneum ſubſtituens, non ſine dicterio, laneum viz. ad vtram que anni tempeſtatem eſſe aptius.
               
               Is this glory fit for Chriſts ſpouſe? belike then Chriſt hath carnall eies and eares: and is delighted with thoſe things wherewith the world is delighted. The wiſer among the heathen did ſcoffe at ſuch baſe conceits which their people had of their gods. Shall Chriſtians thinke more baſely of Chriſt, then the heathen of their gods? Too much doe moſt people doat on outward worldly glory: euen ſo much as they neglect true righteouſneſſe.
               For our parts as we deſire to appeare before Chriſt ſo as he Vſe. may thinke vs glorious, let vs be araied with righteouſneſſe & holineſſe, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord, Heb. 12. 14.

               HAuing noted the inference of this verſe vpon the former: I will now handle it diſtinctly by it ſelfe. In it is contained a deſcription of the glorious eſtate of the Church in heauen. Of that eſtate muſt this deſcription be here meant,

                     .
                  
a mariage: firſt the ſpouſe was wooed, and then ſet before her husband that he might take her to wife, to be with him. Thus 
                     Gen. 2. 22. 
                  Eue was preſented by God to Adam that he might take her for his wife: and 
                     Eſt. 2. 13. 
                  Eſther among other virgins was preſented to Ahaſh-veroſh. This ſheweth that Doct.
               
               
                  The Church in heauen ſhall enioy the preſence of Chriſt: 
                  
                     Ioh. 14. 2, 3. Chriſt himſelfe ſaith expreſly to his diſciples, I goe to prepare a place for you, that where I am, there ye may be alſo. On this ground did the Apoſtle deſire to depart, namely 
                     Phil. 1. 23. 
                  to be with Chriſt, and 2 Cor. 5. 8. Reaſon.
                   
                  to be preſent with the Lord.
               
               In heauen is the mariage betwixt Chriſt and the Church ſolemnized, which here on earth hath beene in preparing. God the Father hath giuen his 
                     Ioh. 3. 16. ſonne vnto the Church, and the 
                     & 17. 6. Church vnto his ſonne: yea 
                     Act. 20. 28. Chriſt himſelfe hath purchaſed the Church vnto himſelfe by his bloud, and 
                     Oſe. 2. 19, 20. promiſed mariage vnto her, and the more to aſſure the Church of his loue he hath 
                     Eph. 4. 8. beſtowed many gifts vpon her: he hath further ſent Paranymphi. his Miniſters in his name to 
                     Ioh. 3. 29. wooe and 2 Cor. 5. 20. beſeech the Church to giue her conſent, and to 
                     & 11. 2. prepare her as a pure virgin for himſelfe: Hereupon the Church hath giuen her conſent, for 
                     Eph. 5. 24. as a ſpouſe ſhe is ſubiect vnto Chriſt as vnto an head. Theſe things being ſo, how can it be thought that Chriſt will forſake her, and not receiue her to be with him for euer?
               Can the thought of death be terrible to ſuch as know and Vſe. beleeue the truth hereof? Will not rather the conſideration Incoragement againſt death. thereof make them with the Apoſtle to ſigh, and deſire to depart, that they may be with the Lord? The higheſt degree of the Churches happineſſe conſiſteth in this fruition of the 
                     Totum tibi ſit Deus: quia horum quae diligis, totum tibi eſt. Aug. in Ioh. 3. tract. 13. Reu. 21. 22, 23. Ioh 17. 20, 21. preſence of her ſpouſe: for ſo he becommeth all in all vnto her: not by meanes, as in this world, but immediatly by himſelfe: ſo as there ſhall need no Miniſter, no Sacrament, no ordinance to ſet forth Chriſt vnto vs: no Gouernour in family, Church, or common-wealth, to repreſent his perſon, or to keepe vs in ſubiection: no light to direct vs, no food to ſuſtaine vs; we ſhall be ſo aſſiſted with Chriſt as we ſhall need nothing. If thoſe ſeruants were happy that ſtood continually before Salomon, what are they that alwaies ſtand not as ſeruants 1 King. 10. 8.
                  
but as a wife in his preſence that is infinitly greater then Salomon? If it were a great grace & fauour, that Moſes ſaw the backparts 
                     Exo. 33. 23. of God, what a grace and fauour is it, to behold Chriſt 1 Cor. 13. 12. face to face? For when he doth appeare, we ſhall ſee him as he is. 
                  1 Joh. 3 2. Though now we be abſent from the Lord, yet let vs vphold our ſelues with the expectation and aſſurance of this, that we ſhall be preſented before Chriſt.
            
            
               §. 50. Of the Glorie of the Church in heauen.
               
               
                  The quality of the Church in heauen is as excellent as may be, 
                  Doctr. and therefore here ſaid to be glorious: all beautie, all comelineſſe, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . all grace, whatſoeuer may make the Church amiable, louely, or any way to be deſired, or admired, is compriſed vnder this word glorious. In this reſpect the Saints are ſaid to ſhine, and that as 
                  
                     Reu. 21. 11. 
                  pretious ſtones, yea as the 
                     Dan. 12. 3. 
                  firmament, as the ſtarres, and as the 
                     Mat. 13. 43. 
                  ſunne: and to be 1 Ioh. 3, 2. 
                  like Chriſt himſelfe: and to 
                     Col. 3 4. 
                  appeare with him in glory.
               
               This glory of the Saints extendeth both to ſoule and body, and whole perſon.
               In regard of their ſoules they ſhall be all 
                     Pſal. 45. 13. 
                  glorious within: for they are 
                     Heb. 12. 23. 
                  Spirits of iuſt men, made perfect: 
                  1 Cor. 13. 12. perfect knowledge, wiſdome, and all manner of purity ſhall be in them.
               In regard of their bodies, they ſhall be 
                     Phil. 3. 21. 
                  faſhioned like to Chriſts glorious body: and that in incorruption, immortality, 
                     Eccleſia in fine ſeculi expectat quo l in Chriſti corpore praemonſtratum eſt, &c. Aug. Epiſt. 119. beauty, brightneſſe, grace, fauour, agility, ſtrength, and the like. It is therefore truly ſaid, that the Church in the end of the world expecteth that which is before demonſtrated in Chriſts body.
               In regard of their perſon, as a wife is aduanced to the honour and dignity of her husband, ſo ſhall they to the honour and dignity of Chriſt, ſo farre as they are capable of it: for they ſhall be 
                     Luk. 22. 30. next vnto Chriſt, yea 
                     Ioh. 17. 21 one with him, and ſo 
                     Heb. 1. 14. aboue the moſt glorious Angels.
               Much more might be ſpoken of the glory of the Church: but neuer can enough be ſpoken thereof, no not by the tongue of men or Angels: for 1 Cor. 2. 9. 
                  eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, neither haue entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them which loue him. When Paul was rapt vp into the third heauen, and ſaw but a glimps of this

glory, 2 Cer. 12 4. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . he heard vnſpeakable words, which are not poſſible for man to vtter. Wherefore 2 Cer. 4. 17. when he ſpeaketh of it, he vſeth ſuch a tranſcendent kinde of phraſe, as cannot in any tongue be fully expreſſed: we thus as well as we can by one degree of compariſon vpon another tranſlate it, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glorie.
               Is not this ſufficient to vphold vs againſt all the reproach and diſgrace which the world layeth vpon vs, becauſe we are Uſe. of the Church of Chriſt? The world hath 
                     Iſa. 62. 4. of old counted her, to whom Chriſt ſaith, Hephzibah (that is, my delight in her) and Beulah (that is, maried) forſaken and deſolate, yea 1 Cor. 4. 13. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  as the filth of the world, and the off-ſcowring of all things. Among Heathen, none ſo vildly eſteemed of as Chriſtians; and amongſt Papiſts, none ſo as Proteſtants; & amongſt carnall Goſpellers, none ſo as they who endeuour 1 Ioh. 3. 3. to purifie themſelues as Chriſt is pure, and to auoid the common ſins of the world. When for Chriſts ſake we are baſely accounted of, let vs thinke of this.
            
            
               §. 51. Of the Churches freedome from all deformity in heauen. Not hauing ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing.
               
               The firſt point noted by the Apoſtle in his exemplification of the forenamed glorie, is a remouing of all deformitie. The word tranſlated 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  ſpot, is taken for a ſtaine on a garment, and a foule ſpecke on a mans face, or other part of the bodie: or a ſcarre, or other blemiſh in his fleſh by a ſore, wound, blow, or the like. The other word (
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  wrinkl-) is taken for a creaſt in the face through old age, for it ſignifieth a gathering together of the skin by old age: by it is meant any manner of breaking (as we ſpeake) by age, ſickneſſe, trouble, paine, or the like. Becauſe there may be alſo deformities other wayes, the Apoſtle addeth this clauſe (or any ſuch thing.) Theſe things applied to 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . the Church, ſhew that
               
                  No manner of deformitie ſhall cleaue to the Church in heauen. 
                  Doctr. Thereſhall be in her no ſtaine or contagion of ſinne receiued from others, no ſcarre of any euill humour ariſing from it ſelfe, no wrinkle, no defect of ſpirituall moiſture, no ſigne of the old man, nor any thing that may any way make it ſeeme deformed, or vncomely in the ſight of Chriſt. Not only great,

hainous, capitall ſins, (which are as botches and boiles, and as open, wide ſores, gaſhes and wounds) but all ſpots and ſpecks, all wrinkles and defects, all manner of blemiſhes whatſoeuer within, or without, ſhall be cleane taken away. Sinne ſhall not only be ſubdued in vs, but vtterly rooted out of vs: no relique, no ſigne thereof ſhall be left remaining. In this reſpect it is ſaid, that God ſhall wipe away all teares, that is, ſhall take away all 
                     Reu. 7. 17. & 21. 4. matter of mourning, ſorrow, and griefe. Now there is nothing that miniſtreth matter of more ſorrow to the Saints then ſinne. That remnant of ſin which was in the Apoſtle euen after his regeneration, made him thus cry out, O wretched man that I am. 
                  
                     Rom. 7. 24.
               
               Though this be but a priuatiue good, yet it addeth much to the heauenly happineſſe of the Saints. If it were poſſible that we ſhould enioy the reſt and glorie prepared for the Saints in heauen, and withall there ſhould remaine on vs the ſpots and wrinkles of ſinne, theſe ſpots and wrinkles would be as the hand-writing which appeared to Belſhazzer in the midſt of 
                     Dan 5. 5. his iollitie: they would be as gall mixed with wine: they would turne all our ioy into heauineſſe, and take away the ſweet relliſh of all our happineſſe. The conſideration therefore of this priuatiue benefit cannot but breed in the hearts of all ſuch as are members of this Church a longing deſire after this perfect purging of them from all deformitie.
            
            
               §. 52. Of the perfect puritie of the Church in heauen.
               
               But that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.
               The laſt branch whereby the celeſtiall glorie of the Church is ſet forth, is the perfect puritie thereof: the aduerſatiue particle (BVT) ſheweth that the holineſſe here ſpoken of is no imperfect 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . holineſſe, ſuch as the ſanctification of the Saints is in this world, but an abſolute perfect holineſſe in all the parts and degrees thereof: ſuch as is without ſpot or wrinkle: without relique, or ſigne of ſinne: and therefore by way of explanation is added, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  without blemiſh, or blameleſſe: ſuch as man, Angell, nor God himſelfe can finde fault withall. 
                     Heb. 9. 14. This attribute is oft applied to the perſon and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, and therefore 1 Pet. 1. 19. it muſt needs ſet forth perfect puritie. Whence we may obſerue that
               
                  
                  The Sanctification of the Saints ſhall be perfect in heauen. They ſhall not only be iuſtified by hauing their ſinnes couered to them, nor only haue their ſanctification truly begun in them, but alſo in euerie part, point, and degree thereof abſolutely perfected: in which reſpect they are ſaid to be iuſt men made 
                  
                     Heb. 12. 23. 
                  perfect. Adam in his innocencie was not more pure then the Saints ſhall be in heauen: yea they ſhall farre ſurpaſſe Adam as in the meaſure, ſo in the ſtabilite and perpetuitie thereof.
               In our endeuour after holineſſe let vs haue an eye to this Vſe. perfection: and not faint, if we attaine not to that meaſure which we deſire. Perfection is reſerued for the world to come. Yet know we, that the more holy and blameleſſe we are, the neerer we come to that heauenly eſtate: the more ſpots and blemiſhes of ſinne we haue, the more vnlike we are vnto it, and the leſſe hope we haue of enioying that heauenly happineſſe.
               All the forenamed ſeuerall points of the glorious eſtate of Generall vſes of the glorious eſtate of the Church in heauen. the Church in heauen ſhould rauiſh our ſpirits, and euen breake our hearts with an holy admiration of Chriſts good-neſſe, and fill our mouths with praiſes for the ſame, and make vs ſigh, and long after the ſame, and with all good conſcience and diligence vſe all the meanes we can to attaine thereunto: no labour will be loſt herein. Surely, this is either not knowne, or not beleeued, or not remembred, or not duly and ſeriouſly conſidered by ſuch as make light account thereof. Let that which hath beene but briefly touched be further meditated vpon, and let vs pray that the eyes of our vnderſtanding may be enlightned, 
                  
                     Epheſ. 1. 18. 
                  that we may know what is the riches of the glorious inheritance of the Saints. Were it not for this hope, the Saints were 1 Eor. 15. 19. of all the moſt miſerable; whereas now they are the moſt happy.
            
            
               §. 53. Of the application of the things which Chriſt hath done for the Church, vnto husbands.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 28.
                  
                     So ought men to loue their wiues, &c.
               
               THE firſt clauſe of this verſe ſerueth both for an application of the former argument, and alſo for a tranſition to another argument.
               The particle of relation (So) ſheweth that that which hath

before beene deliuered of Chriſts loue to his Church, ought to be referred and applied to husbands. For as Chriſt loued his Church, So ought husbands to loue their wiues.
               
                  
                     Queſt. Why are theſe tranſcendent euidences of Chriſts ſurpaſſing loue to his Church ſet before husbands? can any ſuch things be expected from husbands to their wiues?
                  
                     Anſw. No, See §. 27. not for meaſure, but for likeneſſe. For in this large declaration of Chriſts loue, there are two generall points to be noted.
                  1. That the Church in her ſelfe was no way worthie of loue.
                  2. That Chriſt ſo carried himſelfe towards her that he made her worthie of much loue.
                  This ought to be the minde of husbands to their wiues.
                  1. Though they be no way worthie of loue, yet they muſt loue them.
                  2. They muſt endeuour with all the wit and wiſdome they haue, to make them worthie of loue. I ſay endeuour becauſe it is not ſimply in the husbands power to doe the deed. Yet his faithfull endeuour ſhall on his part be accepted for the deed.
                  Of theſe points I ſhall hereafter more fully ſpeake.
               
            
            
               §. 54. Of the application of the loue which a man beareth to himſelfe, vnto an husband.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 28.
                  
                     
                        So ought men to loue their wiues as their owne bodies.
                     
                  
               
               THe forenamed particle (So) hath alſo relation to another patterne, namely, of a mans ſelfe to his bodie: and ſo it is a tranſition from one argument to another.
               There is ſome more Emphaſis here vſed in ſetting downe an husbands dutie, then was before, verſ. 25.
               There it was laid downe by way of exhortation, Husbands loue your wiues.
               
               Here it is laid downe with a ſtraiter charge: Husbands ought to loue their wiues. So as this dutie is not a matter arbitrarie, left to the husbands will to doe it, or leaue it vndone:

there is a neceſſitie laid vpon him: he muſt loue his wife. Woe therefore vnto him if he doe it not.
               In ſetting downe this argument taken from a mans ſelfe, the Apoſtle reſembleth a mans wife vnto his bodie: wherein he hath relation to verſ. 23. where he ſaid, the husband is the head of the wife. Whereby he ſheweth, that as an husbands place is a motiue to his wife, for her to performe her dutie: ſo to himſelfe, See Treat. 4. §. 74 76. Why the patterne of a mans ſelfe is added to the patterne of Chriſt. for him to performe his dutie.
               He is her head, therefore ſhe muſt be ſubiect to him.
               She is his bodie, therefore he muſt loue her.
               This example of a mans ſelfe is both a reaſon, the more to moue husbands to loue their wiues, and alſo a rule to teach them how to loue them.
               The reaſon is implied vnder that neere vnion that is betwixt 
                     Sicut corpus nunquam à ſe diſſidet, ne
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         anima aduerſus ſeipſum, ita virum & mulierem non conuenit diſſidere. Chryſ. in Gen. hom. 45. a man and his wife: ſhe is as neere to him as his owne bodie: therefore ſhe ought to be as deere to him. The bodie neuer diſſenteth from it ſelfe, nor the ſoule againſt it ſelfe. So neither ſhould man and wife.
               The rule is noted vnder the manner of a mans louing his owne bodie: as intirely as he loueth his bodie, ſo intirely he ought to loue his wife.
               Of the manner of a mans louing himſelfe, ſee Treat. 4. §. 74. 76.
               The more to enforce this compariſon, the Apoſtle addeth, He that loueth his wife, loueth himſelfe. 
                  
                     Epheſ. 5. 28.
               
               By this clauſe two things are implied.
               1. That a wife is not only as a mans bodie, namely, his outward fleſh, but as his perſon, his bodie and ſoule. She is as his bodie, becauſe ſhe was taken out of his bodie: and becauſe 
                     Gen. 2. 23. ſhe is ſet vnder him, as his bodie vnder his head. She is as himſelfe, by reaſon of the bond of mariage, which maketh one of two. In which reſpect a wife is commonly called a mans 
                     Matth. 19. 5, 6. 
                  ſecond ſelfe.
               
               2. That an husband in louing his wife loueth himſelfe: ſo as the benefit of louing his wife will redound to himſelfe, as well as to his wife.
            
            
               
               §. 55. Of the amplification of a mans loue of himſelfe.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 29.
                  For no man euer yet hated his owne fleſh: but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, euen as the Lord the Church.
               
               THe former patterne of a mans ſelfe is here further amplified. For firſt the Apoſtle proueth, that a man loueth himſelfe: and then he ſheweth how he loueth himſelfe.
               Two arguments are vſed to proue the point.
               One is taken from the contrarie: No man euer yet hated his owne fleſh. Therefore he loueth it.
               
               The other is taken from the effects of loue: To nouriſh and cheriſh ones fleſh is a fruit of loue: But euerie man nouriſheth and cheriſheth his fleſh. Therefore he loueth it.
               
               This latter argument ſheweth the manner of a mans louing himſelfe: and therein a mans loue of himſelfe is a rule to teach him how to loue his wife.
               This indefinite particle (no man) is to be reſtrained to ſuch as haue the vnderſtanding and affection of a man in them: as if he had ſaid, no man in his right wits: for furious, franticke, mad, deſperate perſons will cut their armes, legs, and other parts, mangle their fleſh, hang, drowne, ſmother, choake, and ſtab themſelues. Euen ſo they are as men out of their wits, who 
                     Quia ſe diligat, & prodeſſe ſibi velit, dubitare dementis eſt. Aug. de doct. Chriſt. lib. 1. cap. 25. hate, or any way hurt their wiues: yea, it is the part of a mad man to doubt of louing, and doing good to himſelfe.
               Theſe two words (to nouriſh and cheriſh) comprize vnder them a carefull prouiding of all things needfull for a mans bodie.
               To nouriſh, is properly to feed. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
               
               To cheriſh, is to keepe warme. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
               
               The former is done by food: the latter by apparell. Vnder Proprie dicitur de galina fouente oua, quum illis incubat. food, and apparell the Apoſtle comprizeth all things needfull for this life, where he ſaith, Hauing food andraiment, let vs therewith be content. 
                  1 Tim 6. 8.
               
               This applied to an husband, ſheweth that he ought to haue a prouident care for the good of his wife in all things needfull for her.
               
                  
That he may yet further preſſe this point, he returneth againe to the example of Chriſt (euen as the Lord the Church) The Apoſtle thought that this naile of loue had need be faſt beaten into the heads and hearts of husbands, and therefore addeth blow to blow to knocke it vp deepe, euen to the head: before he confirmed Chriſts example with the example of our ſelues: here he confirmeth the example of our ſelues with the example of Chriſt againe. This he doth for two eſpeciall reaſons.
               1. The more forcibly to vrge the point: for two examples adde weight one to another: eſpecially this latter which is ſo farre more excellent as we heard out of verſ. 25, 26, 27.
               2. To giue husbands a better direction for their prouidence towards their wiues, whom they muſt nouriſh and cheriſh, not only as their bodies, but as Chriſt nouriſheth and cheriſheth his Church, not only with things temporall, but alſo with things ſpirituall and eternall.
            
            
               §. 56. Of mans naturall affection to himſelfe.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 28, 29.
                  So ought men to loue their wiues as their owne bodies: he that loueth his wife loueth himſelfe. For no man euer yet hated his owne fleſh: but nouriſheth, and cheriſheth it, euen as the Lord the Church.
               
               HAuing briefly ſhewed the generall ſcope of the 28 and 29 verſes, I will proceed to a more diſtinct handling of them.
               They ſetforth The naturall affection of a man to himſelfe. 
                  Summ
                        •

               Two points are here to be noted.
               1. The generall propoſition, that a man is well affected to himſelfe.
               
               2. The particular amplification, and manifeſtation of that affection.
               This is manifeſted two waies.
               
                  
                     
                        1. Negatiuely, No man hateth his owne fleſh.
                        
                         
                         
                     
                     
                        2. Affirmatiuely, and that in two branches
                        1. Nouriſheth
                        
                        it.
                     
                     
                        2. Cheriſheth
                        
                         
                         
                     
                  
               
               
                  
Both theſe are iuſtified by the like affection of Chriſt to the Church which is his body (Euen as the Lord the Church) In that the Apoſtle propoundeth the naturall affection of a mans ſelfe to his body as a motiue and patterne to Chriſtians, to loue their wiues, and alſo iuſtifieth the ſame by a like affection of Chriſt to his Church, I obſerue that
               
                  Naturall affection is a thing lawfull and commendable: it is Doctr. an affection which may ſtand with a good conſcience: which Gods word is ſo farre from taking away, as it doth eſtabliſh it. For ſuch as are 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  without naturall affection are directly condemned: and we are 
                     Rom. 12. 10 commanded to be ſo kindly affectioned 
                     Rom. 1. 30. one to another as 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   we are to our ſelues. Yea the law in 2 Tim. 3. 3. the ſtrict rigour thereof laieth downe that naturall affection which is in a man to himſelfe as a rule for the loue of his neighbour (
                     Mat. 22. 39. 
                  thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.) Hence is it that the 
                     Leu. 19. 18. Iſa. 58. 7. Prophets, 1 Cor. 12. 26. Jam. 2. 8. Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelfe doe oft call vpon vs to haue an eie to that affection which we beare to our ſelues. Of this patterne Chriſt ſaith, 
                     Mat. 7. 12. 
                  This is the Law, and the Prophets, this is the briefe ſumme of them, this is it which they doe much vrge and preſſe.
               1. Naturall affection was at firſt created of God, by him Reaſons. planted in man, ſo that as ſoule, body, the powers, and parts of them, are in their ſubſtance good things, this affection alſo in it ſelfe is good.
               2. There are the ſame reaſons to loue our ſelues, as our brethren. For we our ſelues are made after Gods image, redeemed by Chriſts bloud, members of the ſame myſticall bodie, keepers of our ſelues, to giue an account of the good or hurt we doe to our ſelues, with the like. In the Law, vnder this word neighbour, our ſelues are compriſed: and euery commandement of the ſecond table is to be applied to our ſelues.

                     Obiect. Louers of themſelues are condemned in Gods word, as 2 Tim. 3. 2. Phil. 2. 21. 1 Cor. 10. 24. Rom. 15. 1.
                  
                     Anſw. There is a double louing of a mans ſelfe. The ſeuerall kindes of ſelfe-loue.
                  
                  One good and commendable:
                  
                     
The other euill, and damnable.
                  
                     
                        
                           Good and commendable louing of a mans ſelfe is
                           1. Naturall.
                        
                        
                           2. Spirituall.
                            
                        
                     
                  
                  That which is naturall is in all by the very inſtinct of nature: and it was at firſt created, and ſtill is by Gods prouidence preſerued in our nature, and that for the preſeruation of nature. Were there not ſuch a naturall loue of himſelfe in euery one, man would be as careleſſe of himſelfe, as of others, and as loth to take paines for himſelfe, as for others. Wherefore that euery one might haue care at leaſt of one, euen of himſelfe, and ſo the world be better preſerued, God hath reſerued in man this naturall affection, notwithſtanding his corruption by ſin. Yea further becauſe euery one is not able to looke to himſelfe, at leaſt when he is young, ſicke, old, or any other way impotent, God by his wiſe prouidence hath extended this naturall affection towards otheralſo as they are neerely linked vnto vs by the bonds of nature. The next to a mans ſelfe are (by bloud and bond of nature) children. Admirably much is that which parents doe for their children, which they would neuer doe, if there were not a naturall affection in them to their children. From children againe this affection ariſeth towards their parents, that when parents grow old, impotent, or any way vnable to helpe themſelues, they might haue ſuccour from their children. And becauſe parents and children are not alwaies together, or not able to helpe one another, or vnnaturall, God hath yet further extended this naturall affection to brethren, couſins, and other kindred. And for a further extent thereof hath inſtituted mariage betwixt ſuch as are not of the ſame bloud, and by vertue of that bond raiſed a naturall affection not only in husband and wife one to another, but alſo in all the alliance that is made therby. Moreouer this affection is wrought in neighbours, friends, fellowes, and other by like bonds knit together, that the bow of Gods prouidence might haue many ſtrings, and if one breake, another might hold. In all theſe kinds, the neerer a man commeth to himſelfe, the more doth this affection ſhew it ſelfe, according to the prouerbe, Neare is my coat, but nearer is my skin. God hauing wrought this naturall affection in the ſeuerall

kindes thereof, and there being good ends and vſes thereof, it is not to be condemned.
               
            
            
               §. 58. Of ſpirituall ſelfe-loue.
               
               Spirituall ſelfe-loue is that which is ſupernaturally wrought in man by Gods Spirit: whereby he is both inlightned to diſcerne what is moſt excellent, and beſt for him, and alſo moued to chooſe the ſame: ſo as this ſerueth to rectifie the former. Hence it commeth to paſſe that their chiefeſt care is for their ſoules, and for the eternall ſaluation thereof: for the furthering whereof they can be content as need requireth, to 1 Cor. 9. 27. beat downe their body, to 2 Cor. 11. 27. denie them ſometimes their ordinary refreſhing by food, reſt, and other like meanes, yea and to 
                     Heb. 11. 36, 37. ſuffer them to be impriſoned, racked, and otherwaies tortured, and life it ſelfe to be taken from them. This men doe, 
                     Non propterea quiſquam dicendus eſt non diligere ſalutem, atque incolumitatem corporis ſui, quia amplius aliquid diligit: nam a

Chr. lib. 1. cap. 25. and ſuffer, not for want of naturall affection, but by reaſon of ſpirituall affection which perſwades them that it is good for them it ſhould be ſo, A man is not therefore to be ſaid not to loue the health and ſafety of his body becauſe he loueth ſomething more. For a couetous man though he loue his money, yet he can be content to part with it for bread to nouriſh his body: ſo a ſpirituall man though he loue his life, yet he can be content to loſe it for his ſoules ſaluation. For he loueth himſelfe ſufficiently, who doth his beſt to enioy the chiefeſt and trueſt good. This ſpirituall affection extendeth it ſelfe as 
                     Ille ſo ſatis diligit qui ſedulo agit vt ſummo & vero perfruatur bono. Aug. de mor. eccl. l. 1. c. 26. farre as, naturall affection, namely to wiues, husbands, children, parents, brethren, coſins, friends, &c. Much is this vrged and preſſed in the Scriptures, as Iſa. 55. 1, 2, 3. Mat. 6. 19, 20, 33. Ioh. 6. 27. 1 Tim. 6. 11, 19.

               1. In the Obiect, when it is caſt vpon our corruptions, our luſts, our euill humors: when we affect and loue them, and for them purſue whatſoeuer may ſatisfie them: as the ambitious, luſtfull, riotous, gluttonous, and other like perſons. This is expreſly forbidden, Make not prouiſion for the fleſh to fulfill 
                  
                     Rom. 13. 14. 
                  the luſts thereof.
               
               2. In the Meaſure, when our loue is wholly and only caſt

vpon our ſelues, ſo ſeeking our owne good, as we regard no mans good but our owne: nor care what dammage another receiueth, ſo we may get aduantage thereby. This is alſo forbidden: 
                     Phil. 2. 21. 1 Cor. 13. 5. & 10. 24. for it is contrary to the property of true loue, which ſeeketh not her owne, namely to the preiudice of another. This hath the title of 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  Selfe-loue appropriated to it. It ſprang from the corruption of nature, and is daily increaſed by the inſtigation of Satan for the deſtruction of mankinde. It manifeſteth it ſelfe by the many tricks of deceit which moſt men vſe in their dealings with others: by making aduantage of others neceſſities as in the caſe of vſurie, of raiſing corne, and other commodities in time of ſcarcity, with the like: by mens backwardneſſe to helpe ſuch as ſtand in need of their ſuccour: by want of compaſſion in other mens miſeries: and by many other like vnkindneſſes: all which verifie the prouerbe, Euery man for himſelfe.
               
               But by diſtinguiſhing the forenamed points we may ſee that notwithſtanding euill ſelf-loue be a moſt deteſtable vice, yet it is both lawfull and commendable to loue ones ſelfe aright.

                   rooted out of man, is contrary to this patterne, and vnworthy to finde any entertainment among Chriſtians: for what doe they aime at, but to root that out of man, which God hath planted in him, and to take away the meanes which God hath vſed for the better preſeruation of man? That wiſe man whom they frame to themſelues is worſe then a brute beaſt: he is a very ſtocke and blocke. Not only the beſt and wiſeſtmen that euer were in the world, but alſo Chriſt himſelfe had thoſe paſſions and affections in him, which they account vnbeſeeming a wiſe man. Their doatage hath long ſince beene hiſſed out of the ſchooles of Philoſophers, ſhould it then finde place in Chriſts Church?
            
            
               §. 61. Of well vſing naturall affection.
               
               Let vs labour to cheriſh this naturall affection in vs, and to 2. Vſe.
                   turne it to the beſt things, euen to ſuch as are not only apparently, but indeed good: and among good things to ſuch as are moſt excellent, and the moſt neceſſary: ſuch as concerne

our ſoules, and eternall life. For this end we muſt pray to haue our vnderſtandings inlightned (that we may diſcerne 
                  
                     Phil. 1. 10. 
                  things that differ, and approue that which is excellent) and to haue our wills and affections ſanctified, that we embrace, purſue, and delight in that which we know to be the beſt. Thus ſhall our naturall affection be turned into a ſpirituall affection.
               Here we ſee how we may make nature a ſchoolemaſter vnto vs: for as Chriſt ſendeth vs to the fowles of the aire, and lillies

We cannot complaine that we haue no ſchoolemaſter neere vs (as many in the country whoſe children for want of one are rudely brought vp) our ſelues are ſchoolemaſters to our ſelues. Wherfore as the Apoſtle hereby teacheth husbands to loue their wiues, ſo let vs all more generally learne to loue one another: for 1 Cor. 12. 12. we are all mutuall members of one and the ſame body: and our brother or neighbour is

               §. 62. Of Mans forbearing to wrong himſelfe.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 29.
                  For no man euer yet hated his owne fleſh: but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.
               
               THe firſt particle (for) ſheweth that in this verſe an euidence and manifeſtation of a mans loue of himſelfe is giuen. The firſt part thereof, which is ſet downe negatiuely, ſheweth that
               
                  It is againſt the common inſtinct of nature for a man to hate 
                  Doctr. 
                  himſelfe. It is noted as an euidence that deuils were in the Gadarene, in that he cut himſelfe with ſtones: had not the deuils 
                     Mar. 5. 5. forced him, he would neuer haue done it.
               Hatred is contrary to loue: it being therefore before proued Reaſon. that euery man by nature loueth himſelfe, by neceſſary conſequence it followeth, that no man hateth his fleſh: for two contrary effects proceed not from the ſame cauſe: no fountaine can yeeld both ſalt water and freſh. 
                  
                     Iam. 3. 12.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Many doe macerate their bodies with faſtings, watchings, labours, trauels, and the like: others teare and gaſh

their fleſh with whips, kniues, ſwords, yea and with their teeth alſo: others lay ſuch violent hands vpon themſelues, as they take away their owne liues.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. None of theſe things are done by the inſtinct of nature which God hath ſet in man, but through the corruption of nature which the deuill hath cauſed. Now nature and corruption of nature are two contrarie cauſes: no maruell then that contrarie effects come from them.
                  2. They thinke they doe theſe things in loue to themſelues; as ſuperſtitious perſons to merit ſaluation, by macerating their bodie: others to free themſelues from ignominie, penurie, ſlauerie, torment, or ſuch like euils: ſo as there is an apparent good that maketh them ſo to doe, and not ſimply hatred of themſelues. They that ſo doe, are either poſſeſſed with a Deuill, or blinded in their minde, or bereaued of their wits, or ouerwhelmed with ſome paſſion, ſo as they know not what they doe: they doe it not therefore in hatred.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. Holy and wiſe men deliberately, and on good aduice, haue beaten downe their bodies, and yeelded their liues 1 Cor. 9. 27. Heb. 11. 35. &c.
                      to be taken away, not accepting deliuerance.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. That was farre from hatred, and in great loue to themſelues, as was ſhewed §. 56. before.
               
            
            
               §. 63. Of vnnaturall practiſes againſt ones ſelfe.
               
               The forenamed doctrine diſcouereth many practiſes vſed 1 Vſe.
                   by ſundry men to be againſt nature, and in that reſpect moſt horrible and deteſtable.
               1. The practiſe of the idolatrous Baalites, who to moue their I doll to heare them, cut themſelues with kniues and lancers, till 
                  1 King. 18. 28. Caſſian. Collat. 19. 
                  the bloud guſhed out vpon them. Not much vnlike to whom are Popiſh Eremites, Anchorites, Monks flagellants, Grandimontenſes, ſundrie ſorts of Franciſcans, and other Friers, whereof 
                     D. Willet Synopſ. Papiſm. Contr. 6. quaeſt. 6. ſome weare ſhirts of haire-cloth, ſome ſhirts of maile next their bodie, ſome goe bare-foot, ſome daily whip themſelues till bloud follow, and ſome waſte their bodies with lying hard, watching, faſting, going on pilgrimage, &c.
               2. The practiſe of Gluttons, Drunkards, vnchaſte and voluptuous perſons, who to ſatisfie their corrupt humours, impaire their health, pull diſeaſes vpon them, and ſhorten their dayes.
               
                  
3. The practiſe of Swaggerers, who by quarrels cauſe their fleſh to be wounded, and their liues taken away. Among theſe may be reckoned ſuch as bring themſelues to great ſtraits, diſtreſſes, and dangers for lucre ſake: and they who by felonie, treaſon, and the like euill deeds, caſt themſelues vpon the ſword of the Magiſtrate.
               4. The practiſe of them that giue the reines to griefe, feare, wrath, and other like violent paſſions, ſo as thereby they weaken their bodies, and ſhorten their dayes.
               5. The practiſe of ſelfe-murtherers: who herein breake the rule of loue (as thy ſelfe) and end their dayes in a moſt horrible 
                     Matth. 22. 39. ſinne, depriuing themſelues of the time, place, and meanes of repentance: ſo as, whatſoeuer fond pretence they make for their ſinne, little better can be thought of them, then that they thruſt their ſoules headlong into hell, vnleſſe the Lord betwixt the act done, and the expiration of their breath, extraordinarily touch their hearts. Religion, nature, ſenſe, and all abhorre this fearefull fact: ſo as not only thoſe who haue beene enlightned 
                     —Quam vellent aethere in alto, Nunc & pauperiem, & duros perferre labores. Uirg. Aen. 6. by Gods word, but alſo the Heathen, who had no other then the light of nature, haue adiudged it to be a moſt deſperate ſinne.
            
            
               §. 64. Of haters of others.
               
               2. By that affection which nature moueth men to beare to their fleſh, we may ſee how nature more preuailes with men, then conſcience and obedience to Gods word, yea then the 2. Vſe.
                   Spirit: for where nature keepeth all men from hating their owne fleſh, nothing can keepe many husbands from hating their wiues, and wiues their husbands; nor brothers, coſens, & neighbours (yet theſe are our owne fleſh) no nor many of thoſe 
                     Iſa. 58. 7. who profeſſe themſelues to be of the myſticall bodie of Chriſt, from hating one another. What ſhall we ſay of theſe? Is nature of greater power, and more mightie in operation then the Spirit? Surely, ſuch either deceiue themſelues and others, in pretending to be members of the bodie of Chriſt: or elſe the Spirit is verie weake in them, and the fleſh beareth a great ſway. Let haters of their brethren thinke of this and bee aſhamed.
            
            
               
               §. 65. Of mans care in prouiding and vſing things needfull for his bodie.
               
               The ſecond euidence of that loue which a man beareth to himſelfe, is noted in two ſuch branches (nouriſheth and cheriſheth) as comprize See §. 55. all needfull things vnder them, ſo as the Apoſtle implieth thereby, that
               
                  Nature teacheth all men to prouide ſuch things as are needfull for 
                  Doctr. 
                  them: needfull for life, as food: and needfull for health, as apparell. Nature is here propounded as a Schoolemaſter to Chriſtians: this therefore which nature teacheth is a bounden dutie. It is much inſiſted vpon by Salomon, who in this reſpect 
                     Eccl. 2. 24. & 3. 13. & 5. 18. & 8. 15. ſaith, It is good and comely for one to eat and drinke, and enioy the good of all his labour.
               
               If he be worſe then an Infidell that prouideth not for his 1 Tim. 5. 8. Inconcuſſa naturae lege diligimus nos ipſos, quae in beſtias etiam promulgata eſt. Aug. de Doct. Chr. li. 1. ca. 26. owne, what is he that prouideth not for himſelfe? euen worſe then a beaſt: for nature hath taught the bruit beaſts to nouriſh and cheriſh themſelues. If any thinke that it more befitteth beaſts, or naturall men then Saints, let them tell me which of the Saints at any time guided by Gods Spirit, hath wholly neglected himſelfe. To omit all others, it is expreſly noted of Chriſt, that as there was occaſion, he 
                     Mat. 8. 24. ſlept, he 
                     Luke 14. 1. eat, he 
                     Iohn 4. 6. reſted, and otherwiſe refreſhed himſelfe.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Though he were 
                        Ioh. 4. 31. &c.
                      hungry, and meat prepared for him, yet he refuſed to eat.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. Forbearing one meale, is no great hinderance of Lawfull faſts no hinderance to the cheriſhing of the body. cheriſhing the body.
                  2. Extraordinarie and weightie occaſions may lawfully make a man a little neglect himſelfe: that ſo he may ſhew he preferreth Gods glorie, and his brothers ſaluation, before the outward nouriſhing of his body: to which purpoſe Chriſt ſaith, My meat is to doe the will of him that ſent me: that is, I 
                        Iohn 4. 34. preferre it before my meat. And Saint Paul ſaith, I will very 
                     2 Cor. 12. 15. 
                     gladly be ſpent for your ſoules. We muſt here therefore take heed of the extremes on both hands.
                  1. Of vndue, and ouermuch neglecting our bodies, ſo as the ſtrength of them be waſted, and the health impaired.
                  2. Of too much caring for it, ſo as vpon no occaſion we will

loſe a meales meat, or a nights reſt. Faſting and watching as occaſion requireth, are bounden duties.
                  But to returne to the point of nouriſhing and cheriſhing our fleſh.
                  1. For this end hath God prouided food, apparell, and all 1. Reaſon.
                      things needfull for our weake bodies, that they ſhould be nouriſhed and cheriſhed thereby: not to vſe them therefore, is to refuſe Gods prouidence.
                  2. By well nouriſhing and cheriſhing our bodies, they are the better enabled to doe that worke and ſeruice which God appointeth to be done: but by neglecting them, they are diſabled thereto. As this is a motiue, ſo ought it to be an end whereat we aime in nouriſhing and cheriſhing our bodies.
               
            
            
               §. 66. Of them that neglect to cheriſh their bodies.
               
               Againſt this good inſtinct of nature doe many offend. Uſe.
               
               1. Couetous miſers, who ſo doat vpon their wealth, and ſo 1. Couetous miſers. delight in abundance of goods treaſured vp, as they afford not themſelues things needfull to nouriſh and cheriſh their bodies. Salomon doth much taxe ſuch: of them he ſaith, that riches are 
                  
                     Eccl. 2. 23. & 5. 11, 12, 13, 14. 
                  kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. Daily experience giueth euidence to the truth thereof: for, beſide that ſuch men make their riches 1 Tim. 6. 9. to be ſnares, and 
                     Mark. 10. 23, &c.
                   hinderances, to keepe them from eternall life; they make this preſent life to be very irkſome, 
                     Eccl. 2. 23. filling their heads full of much carking care, and keeping them from quiet reſt. Many in this caſe are ſo beſotted, Semper eget liquidis, ſemper abundat aquis. Ouid. in Jbin. as, though they haue abundance, yet they will not in health afford themſelues a good meales meat, nor ſeemly apparell: nor in ſickneſſe, needfull phyſicke, no nor fire, and ſuch like common things. Their caſe is worſe then theirs who want: for others will pitie and ſuccour ſuch as want, but who will pitie and ſuccour ſuch?
               2. Such as are too intentiue vpon their buſineſſes, euen the affaires 2. They who are too intentiue on their calling. of their lawfull callings (for in good things there may be exceſſe) herein many Students, Preachers, Lawyers, Tradeſmen, Farmers, Labourers, and others offend, when they afford not ſeaſonable times of refreſhing and reſting to their bodies, but faſt, watch, and toile too much in their calling. They who by ſuch meanes diſable themſelues, doe make themſelues

guiltie of the neglect of ſo much good as they might haue done, if they had nouriſhed and cheriſhed their bodies. Some are ſo eager on their buſineſſe, that they thinke all the time miſpent, which is ſpent in nouriſhing and cheriſhing their bodies; and thereupon wiſh, that their bodies needed no food, ſleepe, or other like meanes of refreſhing. Theſe thoughts and Vnlawfull to deſire that our bodies needed no refreſhing. deſires are fooliſh and ſinfull in many reſpects, as
               1. In manifeſting a ſecret diſcontent and grudging againſt Gods prouidence, who hath thus diſpoſed our eſtate for the clearer manifeſtation of mans weaknes, & Gods care ouer him.
               2. In taking away occaſions of calling vpon God, and giuing praiſe vnto him. For if we ſtood not in ſuch need of Gods prouidence, ſhould we ſo oft pray vnto him for his bleſſing: if by the good meanes which he affordeth vnto vs we felt not the ſweetneſſe and comfort of his prouidence, ſhould we be ſo thankfull to him?
               3. In taking away the meanes of mutuall loue: for if by reaſon of our weakneſſe we ſtood not in need of ſuccour and help one from another, what triall would there be of our loue?
               3. Such as ſever theſe two duties of nature (nouriſhing and 3. They who make exceſſe in one needfull thing, an hinderance to another. 
                  cheriſhing) and make them an hinderance one to another: ſome ſo nouriſh their bodies, as they cannot cheriſh them; that is, they ſpend ſo much in eating and drinking, as they haue nothing to cloath themſelues withall. Others ſo cheriſh them, as they cannot nouriſh them; that is, they ſo prancke vp themſelues with braue apparell aboue their abilitie, as they haue not competent food for themſelues. Theſe fall into two contrarie extremes: into the exceſſe in one thing: and into the defect in another.
            
            
               §. 67. Of contentment in that which is ſufficient.
               
               As the Apoſtle by naming theſe two (nouriſh, cheriſh) ſheweth that both of them are needfull, ſo by naming them only, and no more but them, he ſheweth that they two are ſufficient: whence we learne, that
               
                  Hauing food and raiment, we muſt be therewith content. 
                  Doct.
               
               The Apoſtle in theſe very words laieth downe this doctrine in 1 Tim. 6. 8. another place. The 
                     Prou. 30. 8. praier of Agur, and the tenour of the 
                     Matth. 6. 11. fourth Petition proue as much.
               
                  
                  Queſt. Is a man then ſtrictly bound to care for no more then food to nouriſh, and apparell to cheriſh him?
               
                  Anſw. So this nouriſhing and cheriſhing be extended to that eſtate wherein God hath ſet vs, to the charge which God hath giuen vs, and to the calling which he hath appointed unto vs, we ought to care for no more.
               Let vs therefore take heed of that exceſſe which ariſeth from the corruption of nature, and content our ſelues with that competency which nature requireth.
            
            
               §. 68. Of Chriſts forbearing to hate the Church.
               
               
                  EPHES. 6. 29.
                  Euen as the Lord the Church.
               
               THis confirmation of the patterne of a mans ſelfe by a like patterne of the Lord, hath relation to both the parts of the manifeſtation of a mans loue to himſelfe: both to the negatiue, and ſo it ſheweth, that
               The Lord hateth not his Church.
               And to the affirmatiue, and ſo it ſheweth, that
               The Lord nouriſheth and cheriſheth his Church.
               That difference which is made betwixt Eſau a type of the world (Eſau haue I hated) and Iaakob a type of the Church 
                     Mal. 1. 2, 3. 
                  (Iaakob haue I loued) ſheweth that the Lord is farre from hating his Church. The world, not the Church, is the obiect of Gods hatred.
               
                  Obiect.
                  The 
                        Deut. 1. 27. Church her ſelfe, and the 
                        & 9. 28. enemies thereof oft conceiue by Chriſts dealing with her, that he hateth her.
                  
                     Anſw. It is the fleſh abiding in them that are of the Church which maketh them ſo to conceiue, not the ſpirit: and in the enemies of the Church the fleſh altogether reigneth. But the things of God, and his minde and affection, nor can, nor may be iudged by carnall eies, eies of fleſh. The 
                        Heb. 12. 6. Spirit of God accounteth ſuch things euidences of Gods Ioue, which fleſh iudgeth to be tokens of hatred; namely, corrections.
                  It is not, becauſe there is no matter of hatred in the Church, Reaſon. that Chriſt hateth it not: for by nature all are of one and the ſame curſed ſtocke, 
                        Epheſ. 2. 3. 
                     children of wrath: and after our ſanctification is begun, the fleſh abiding in vs, we daily giue much

occaſion of hatred if Chriſt ſhould take that aduantage againſt vs which he might: but it is that neere vnion which Chriſt hath made betwixt himſelfe and the Church that keepeth him from hating her: he hath made her his Spouſe, and he will not hate his Spouſe: all the occaſion of hatred that ſhe giueth, he will either wipe away or couer.
                  Admirable is the comfort which euery true member of the 1. Vſe. Comfort. Catholike Church may reape from hence: for ſo long as the wrath and hatred of the Lord is turned from vs, nothing can make vs miſerable: we may in this reſpect reioyce not only in proſperitie, but alſo in all manner of affliction. No calamitie can moue Chriſt to hate his Church, but rather the more to pittie it, as we doe our bodies. Nay, though by ſinne he be prouoked, and ſee it needfull to correct his Church, yet in loue, not in hatred, in mercy, not in wrath will he correct it.
                  What now if all the world have vs? Seeing Chriſt hateth 2. Uſe. In couragement. vs not, we need not feare nor care. The ſubiect which is ſure of his Kings fauour, little regardeth the hatred of others. This therefore is to be thought of, both to comfort vs vnder the croſſe, and to encourage vs againſt the hatred of the world. That none may peruert this comfortable doctrine, let me adde two caueats.
                  1. That men deceiue not themſelues with a naked name, thinking themſelues to be of the Church, when they are only in it, 
                        Ier. 12. 8. ſuch may Chriſt hate.
                  2. That being of the Church they waxe not inſolent, and too much prouoke Chriſt to anger: for though he hate not ſuch, yet in wiſdome he may ſo ſeuerely correct them as if he hated them: and make them repent their folly and inſolencie againe and againe.
               
            
            
               §. 69. Of Chriſts nouriſhing and cheriſhing his Church.
               
               2. That The Lord nouriſheth and cheriſheth his Church, is euident by his continuall prouidence ouer her in all ages. When firſt he created man, he 
                     Gen. 1. 28, 29. prouided before hand all things needfull to nouriſh and cheriſh him. When he was moued to deſtroy the earth and all liuing things thereon, he had care of his Church, and prouided an Arke to keepe her out of

her. When he purpoſed to bring a famine on the world, he ſent a man before hand to lay vp prouiſion for his Church. When 
                     Gen. 45. 7. Exo. 16. 15. and 17. 6. his Church was in a barren and drie wilderneſſe, he gaue them bread from heauen, water out of the rocke, and kept their raiment from waxing old, and their feet from ſwelling. After this 
                     Deut. 8. 4. he brought his Church into a land flowing with milke and honie: and ſo long as it remained faithfull he preſerued it in that pleaſant and plentifull land. Thus he dealt with the Church in her non-age: and thus alſo hath he dealt with her in her riper age vnder the Goſpell, as experience of all ages may witneſſe. Neither hath he only nouriſhed and cheriſhed her with temporall bleſſings, but alſo with all needfull ſpirituall bleſſings: his word and Sacraments, his Spirit and the graces thereof hath he in all ages giuen her for that purpoſe: yea with his owne fleſh and bloud hath he fed her, and with 
                     Ioh. 6. 55. his owne righteouſneſſe hath he clothed her.

                     Ezek. 20. 11, 12. regarded not the meanes of ſpirituall

Oh take we heed that the like be not vpbraided to vs. The Lord hath not ſparingly, but moſt liberally and bountifully nouriſhed and cheriſhed vs in this land, and that both with temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings, ſo as he may iuſtly ſay, what could haue beene done

Chriſt will not ſuffer his Church to famiſh for want of food, nor ſtarue for want of cloathing, whether temporall for body, or ſpirituall for ſoule. He that can and will performe it hath ſaid, I will neuer leaue thee nor forſake thee. Lazarus was not 
                     Heb. 13. 5. forſaken; witneſſe the Angels that caried his ſoule into Abrahams 
                  
                     Luk. 16. 22. boſome. If any of Chriſts Church doe periſh for want

of outward meanes, it is becauſe Chriſt by that meanes will aduance them to that place where they ſhall ſtand in need of nothing: ſo as he doth not forſake them.
            
            
               §. 70. Of the vnion betwixt Chriſt and the Saints.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 30.
                  For we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones.
               
               THe reaſon of the forenamed loue of Chriſt, and fruits Inference. thereof to his Church, is here laid downe, as both the cauſall particle (FOR) and the inference of this verſe vpon the former doe ſhew. This reaſon is that neere vnion which is betwixt Chriſt and his Church, ſet forth by a metaphor of the members of our bodie. Whereby he implieth, that though there were no other reaſon to moue an husband to loue his wife then the neere vnion which is betwixt them (they being 
                     Verſ. 23. one bodie, 
                     Verſ. 31. one fleſh, 
                     Verſ. 28. one ſelfe) that were enough, for thereby only is Chriſt moued to loue his Church.
               The myſterie of our ſpirituall vnion with Chriſt is here laid downe, and that as fully, and diſtinctly (though very ſuccinctly) Summe, as in any place of Scripture. I will endeuour to open it as plainly as I can.
               
                  We are] The Apoſtle here changeth both perſon and number: 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Paul ranketh himſelfe among the members of Chriſt. for before he ſpake of the Church as of another in the third perſon, and of one in the ſingular number: but here he ſpeaketh of the ſame in the firſt perſon including himſelfe, and in the plurall number, including all others like himſelfe (elect of God, and Saints by calling) whereby he giueth vs to vnderſtand what he meaneth by the Church, namely the companie of Saints, to which, though he were a Preacher of the Goſpell, an extraordinarie Preacher, an Apoſtle, he aſſociateth and ioyneth himſelfe: noting thereby that he was made partaker of the ſame grace, and ſaued by the ſame meanes that others were. Well might he in this priuiledge not thinke much to ranke himſelfe, becauſe it is the higheſt degree of honour that can be 
                  Obſer. 
                  to be a member of the bodie of Chriſt: much more then to be a Preacher, a Prophet, an Apoſtle, or of any other eminent calling.
               
                  
The metaphor here vſed (members of his body) ſetteth Metaphors which ſet forth our vnion with Chriſt. forth the neere vnion which is betwixt Chriſt and the Saints. Many other metaphors are vſed in Scripture for the ſame purpoſe, as 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6. 
                  foundation and edifice, 
                  
                     Ioh. 15. 5.

                  2 Cor. 11. 2. 
                  husband and wife, with the like, which are all of them very fit, but none more proper and pertinent to the point then this of a body, the Head and members thereof. What neerer vnion can there be then betwixt the head and members of the ſame body?
               If the Apoſtle had here ſtaid, we might haue thought that he had here meant no other thing then he meant 
                     Eph. 1. 23. and 4. 16. and 5. 23. before, where he ſtiled Chriſt an head, and the Church a body: but in that he addeth (Of his fleſh and of his bones) he declareth yet a further myſterie.
               In the generall there is a difference betwixt this phraſe (
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . OF his body) and theſe (OF 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  his fleſh; and OF his bones) the former is a note of the Corporis. genetiue caſe, the two latter are a Ex. praepoſition: for diſtinction ſake the two latter might haue beene tranſlated, out of his fleſh, out of his bones, or from his fleſh, from his bones (for ſo a like phraſe is tranſlated 
                     Eph. 4. 16. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . before, From whom) but ſeeing theſe particles out of, or from are ambiguous, the former tranſlation may ſtand as the beſt, ſo as a difference be made in the ſenſe though there be none in the words.
               The former (members of his body) declareth the vnion it ſelfe.
               The latter (of his fleſh and of his bones) declareth the meanes 
                  How we are of Chriſts fleſh. of making that vnion. This latter hath relation to that which Adam ſaid of Eue, This is now bone of my bones, and fleſh of my fleſh, (Gen. 2. 23.) which is manifeſt by the next verſe which the Apoſtle taketh out of the ſame place. It implieth then, that as Eue was made a woman out of Adams fleſh and bones, ſo the Church is made a Church out of Chriſts fleſh and bones.
               
                  1. Queſt. Was the very ſubſtance of the Saints, their fleſh and bones taken out of Chriſt, as the ſubſtance of Eue was taken out of Adam?
                  
                  
                     Anſw. Not ſo, if the words be literally taken. For ſo may Chriſt rather be ſaid to be of our fleſh, and of our bones, becauſe he tooke our nature, and that from a daughter of Adam: in

which reſpect he is ſaid to be 2 Tim. 2. 8. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     of the ſeed of Dauid, and 
                        Rom. 9. 5. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     of the Iewes, as concerning the fleſh. Beſides, the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith (verſ. 32.) that This is a great myſterie. The myſterie therefore muſt be ſearched out. For this end Chriſt muſt be conſidered as another Adam (and ſo the holy Ghoſt ſtileth him 1 Cor. 15. 45, 47. 
                     The laſt Adam, The ſecond man) that is, a ſtocke, a root that giueth a being to branches ſprouting out of him.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. What being is that which we receiue from Chriſt? What being we receiue from Chriſt.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. Not our naturall being (that we haue of the parents of our fleſh) but a ſupernaturall, and ſpirituall being, which the Scripture termeth 
                        Tit. 3. 5. 
                     a new birth, 
                     
                        Epheſ. 4. 24. 
                     a new man, 
                     2 Cor. 5. 17. 
                     a new creature. This ſpirituall being is not in regard of the ſubſtance of our ſoule, or bodie, or of any of the powers or parts, faculties or members of them (for all theſe we haue by lineall deſcent from Adam, and all theſe haue all ſorts of men, as well they who are not of the Church, as they who are of it) but in regard of the integritie, goodneſſe, and diuine qualities which are in them 2 Pet. 1. 4. Epheſ. 4. 24. euen that holineſſe and righteouſneſſe wherewith the Church is endued and adorned. As we are naturall men we are of Adam, as we are ſpirituall men we are of Chriſt.
                  
               
               
                  3. Queſt. Why is mention made of fleſh and bones in this Why we are ſaid to be of Chriſts fleſh. Gen. 2. 23. ſpirituall being?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. In alluſion to the creation of Eue, that by comparing this with that, this might be the better conceiued.
                  2. In regard of the Lords Supper, where the fleſh of Chriſt is myſtically ſet before vs to be ſpirituall food vnto vs. That as before (verſ. 26.) he ſhewed the myſterie of one Sacrament, Baptiſme; here he might ſhew the myſterie of the other Sacrament, The Lords Supper.
                  
                  3. In relation to Chriſts humane nature, by vertue whereof we come to be vnited vnto Chriſt. For the diuine nature of Chriſt is infinite, incomprehenſible, incommunicable, and 
                        Diuinitas vnigeniti facta eſt particeps mortalitatis noſtrae, vt & nos participes eius immortalitatis eſſemus. Aug. Epiſt. 57. there is no manner of proportion betwixt it and vs, ſo as we could not be vnited to it immediately. But Chriſt by taking his humane nature into the vnitie of his diuine nature, made himſelfe one with vs, and vs one with him: ſo as by his partaking of our mortalitie, we are made partakers of his immortalitie.
               
               
                  
                  4. Queſt. Are we then vnited only to his humane nature?
                  
                     Anſw. No: we are vnited to his perſon, God-Man. For as We are vnited to Chriſts perſon. the diuine nature, in and by it ſelfe, is incommunicable; ſo the humane nature ſingly conſidered, in and by it ſelfe, is vnprofitable. The Deitie is the fountaine of all life and grace: the fleſh quickneth not: but that ſpirituall life which originally and primarily floweth from the Deitie, as from a fountaine, is by the humanitie of Chriſt, as by a conduit-pipe, conueyed into vs.
               
               
                  5. Queſt. How can we who are on earth, be vnited to his How Saints on earth are vnited to Chriſt in heauen. humane nature, which is contained in the higheſt heauen?
                  
                     Anſw. This vnion being ſupernaturall and ſpirituall, there needeth no locall preſence for the making of it. That eternall Spirit which is in Chriſt is conueyed into euerie of the Saints (as the ſoule of a man is into euerie member and part of his bodie) by vertue whereof they are all made one with Chriſt, and with one another: by one Spirit we are all baptized into one bodie, 
                     1 Cor. 12. 12, 13. which bodie is Chriſt.
                  
                  This is to be noted againſt theſe two errours. The firſt is I. Error. this, We are vnited firſt to the diuine nature of Chriſt which is euerie where, and by vertue thereof to his humane nature.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. 1. The Deitie (as we ſhewed) is immediately incommunicable: ſo as this cannot be.
                  2. Our vnion with Chriſt is ſpirituall, not phyſicall or naturall, ſo as this locall preſence needeth not.
                  The ſecond errour is this,
                  
                     The humane nature of Chriſt hath all the diuine properties in it, 
                     II. Error. ſo as it is euerie where preſent, and by reaſon thereof we are vnited vnto Chriſt.
                  
                     Anſw. This alſo is impoſſible and needleſſe. The properties of a true bodie cannot poſſibly admit the incommunicable properties of the Deitie: that implieth direct contradiction, which is, that finite ſhould be infinite. Needleſſe alſo this is, becauſe the vnion we ſpeake of, is (as we ſaid) ſpirituall.
               
               
                  6. Queſt. What kinde of vnion is this ſpirituall vnion? Our vnion with Chriſt a true and reall vnion.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. A true, reall vnion of our perſons (bodies and ſoules) with the perſon of Chriſt (God and man.) For as the holy Ghoſt did vnite in the virgins wombe the diuine and humane

natures of Chriſt, and made them one perſon, by reaſon wherof Chriſt is of our fleſh & of our bones: ſo the ſpirit vniteth that perſon of Chriſt with our perſons, by reaſon whereof we are of his fleſh, and of his bones. A great difference there is betwixt the kindes of theſe vnions: for the vnion of Chriſts two natures is hypoſtaticall and eſſentiall, they make one perſon: but the vnion of Chriſts perſon, and ours, is ſpirituall and myſticall: they make one myſticall body: yet is there no difference in the reality and truth of theſe vnions: our vnion with Chriſt is neuer a whit the leſſe reall and true becauſe it is myſticall and ſpirituall: they who haue the ſame ſpirit ar
                        •
                      as truly one, as thoſe parts which haue the ſame ſoule. The effects which proceed from this vnion doe ſhew the truth thereof: for that ſpirit which ſanctified Chriſt in his mothers wombe ſanctifieth vs alſo, that which quickned him quickneth 
                        Rom. 8. 11. Eph. 2. 6. vs, that which raiſed him from death, raiſeth vs, that which exalted him exalteth vs. The many reſemblances which the Scripture vſeth to ſet forth this vnion, doe ſhew the truth thereof: but moſt liuely is it ſet forth by that reſemblance which Chriſt maketh betwixt it and his vnion with his Father. I pray (ſaith he of all his Saints) That they may all 
                     
                        Ioh. 17. 21, 22. 
                     be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in vs: that they may be one, as we are one. This note of compariſon (as) is not to be taken of the kinde, but of the truth of theſe vnions, our vnion with Chriſt is as true as Chriſts vnion with his Father.
                  So true is this vnion, as not only Ieſus himſelfe, but all the 
                        Unuſquiſque Chriſtianus non incongruè ſuſtinet perſonam Chriſti. Aug. de Gen. l. 2. c. 24. vide eundem quaeſt. 69. Saints which are members of this body together with Ieſus the head thereof are called CHRIST, 1 Cor. 12. 12. Gal. 3. 16.
                  This is to be noted againſt their conceit, who imagine this vnion to be only in imagination and conceit: or elſe only in conſent of ſpirit, heart, and will: or at the moſt, in participation of ſpirituall graces.
               
               
                  7. Queſt. What is the bond whereby this vnion is made: With what bonds we are vnited to Chriſt. 1 Joh. 4. 13. namely whereby Chriſt and the Saints are made one?
                  
                     Anſw. There is a double bond, one on Chriſts part, euen the ſpirit of Chriſt (for hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in vs, becauſe he hath giuen vs of his ſpirit) another on the

Saints part, euen faith (for Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by faith) 
                     
                        Eph. 3. 17. The ſpirit is conueyed into vs when we are dead in ſinnes, wholly fleſh, but being in vs, it breedeth this bleſſed inſtrument of faith whereby we lay hold on Chriſt, and grow into him as the ſcience into the ſtocke. Thus Chriſt laying hold on vs by his ſpirit, and we on him by faith, we come to be incorporated into him, and made one body, as the ſcience and ſtocke one tree.
               
               
                  8. Queſt. To what end hath Chriſt thus truly and neerely Why Chriſt made the Saints one with himſelfe. vnited vs vnto himſelfe?
                  
                     Anſw. Not for any benefit vnto himſelfe: but meerely for the honour and good of the Church. By this vnion the honour of Chriſt is communicated to the Church, as the honour of an husband to his wife, and of an head to the body. Great alſo is the benefit which the Church reapeth thereby: for by this meanes is Chriſt made more fit to doe good to the Church, as an head to the body, and the Church is made more capable of receiuing good from Chriſt, as a body from the head, being knit to it by the ſoule, and by veines, ſinewes, nerues, arteries, and other like ligaments.
                  Thus hauing as plainly as I can by queſtions and anſwers laid open this great myſterie, I will further note out ſome of thoſe excellent priuiledges which by vertue thereof appertaine to the Saints, and alſo ſome of the principall duties which in regard thereof the Saints are bound vnto.
               
            
            
               §. 71. Of the priuiledges appertaining to the Saints euen in this life by reaſon of their vnion with Chriſt.
               
               The priuiledges of the Saints which ariſe from their vnion with Chriſt reſpect this life, the time of death, and the life to come.
               In this life theſe,
               1. A moſt glorious condition, which is to be a part of Chriſt, a 1. Saints are members of a glorious body. member of his body. All the glory of Adam in Paradiſe, or of the Angels in heauen is not comparable to this. In this reſpect the Saints are ſaid to be crowned with glory and honour, and to haue all things put vnder their feet. Compare Pſal. 8. 4, 5. &c. with Heb. 2. 6, 7. &c. and ye ſhall finde the Apoſtle apply that to Chriſt, which the Prophet ſpake indefinitly of man.

Now thoſe two places cannot be better reconciled, then by 
                     Coelo, & Angelis, & omni creatura honorabilior eſt ecclesia. Chryſ. de Pentecoſt. ſerm. 26. this vnion of Chriſt and Saints: for ſeeing both make one body, which is Chriſt, that which is ſpoken of the body may be applied to the head, and that which is ſpoken of the head may be applied to the body: for the ſame honour appertaineth to both. In which reſpect the Church is more honourable then Heauen, Angels, and euery other creature.
               2. The attendance of good Angels, who are ſent forth to miniſter 
                  2. Saints attended by Angels. 
                  for them who ſhall be heires of ſaluation, becauſe thoſe heires are of the body of Chriſt, who is their Lord. Theſe are thoſe horſes, and charets of fire which were round about Eliſha: 
                  
                     Heb. 1. 14. 2 King. 6. 17. which are alſo round about euery of Gods Saints in all their diſtreſſes, though we ſee them no more then the ſeruant of the man of God ſaw them, till the Lord opened his eies. That charge which is giuen to the Angels ouer the Sonne of God to keepe him in all his waies, and to beare him in their hands leſt 
                  
                     Pſal. 91. 11, 12. 
                  he daſh his foot againſt a ſtone, hath relation to this body which is Chriſt.
               
               3. An honour to make Chriſt himſelfe perfect: for as the ſeuerall 3. Saints make Chriſt perfect. members make a naturall body perfect, ſo the ſeuerall Saints, this bodie which is Chriſt. In this reſpect the Church is ſaid to be the fulneſſe of him that filleth all in all. 
                  
                     Eph. 1. 23. Chriſt filleth all things, and yet the Church maketh him full: which is to be vnderſtood of that voluntary condition whereunto Chriſt ſubiected himſelfe, to be the head of a body: ſo as without the parts of the body he is imperfect, as a naturall body is maimed and imperfect if it want but the leaſt member thereof. How can we now thinke but that he will preſerue and keepe ſafe all his Saints? Will he reſtore to vs all the parts of our naturall body at the generall reſurrection, and will he loſe any of the parts of his owne myſticall bodie?
               4. A kinde of poſſeſſion of heauen while we are on earth: for 4. Saints aſſured of ſaluation: and how. that which the head hath a poſſeſſion of, the body and ſeuerall members haue alſo a poſſeſſion of. In this reſpect it is ſaid, he hath raiſed vs vp together, and made vs ſit together in 
                  
                     Eph. 2. 6. 
                  heauenly places. And, he that beleeueth on him hath euerlaſting 
                  
                     Ioh. 5. 24. 
                  life: is paſſed from death vnto life. And, he that hath the Sonne, 
                  1 Ioh. 5. 12. 
                  hath life. This is ſomewhat more then hope: and ſerueth exceedingly

to ſtrengthen our hope, and giue vs aſſurance of that heauenly inheritance.
               They know not the power of God, nor the vertue of this vnion, who denie that the Saints haue aſſurance of ſaluation. For (to follow this metaphor a little) ſuppoſe a man were caſt into a riuer, and his head able to lift and keepe it ſelfe aboue water, would we not ſay, that man is ſafe enough, he is aboue water. This is the caſe of this myſticall body: it being caſt into the ſea of this world, Chriſt the head thereof hath lift, and keepes himſelfe aloft euen in heauen. Is there now any feare, any poſſibility of the drowning of this body, or of any member thereof? If any ſhould be drowned, then either Chriſt muſt be drowned, or elſe that member pulled from Chriſt; both which are impoſſible. Thus then by vertue of this vnion we ſee how on Chriſts ſafety, ours dependeth: if he be ſafe, ſo are we: if we periſh, ſo muſt he.
               In this reſpect yee may be ſecure O fleſh and bloud: yee haue 
                  Securi eſtote caro & ſanguis: vſurpaſtis coelum in Chriſto: negent & in coelo Chriſtum qui vobis coelum negant. Tertul. de Reſur. 
                  got heauen in Chriſt: they who denie heauen to you, may alſo denie Chriſt to be in heauen.
               
               Learne here how to conceiue of the reſurrection, aſcenſion and ſafety of Chriſt, euen as of the reſurrection, aſcenſion and ſafety of an head, in and with whom his body and all his members are raiſed, exalted, and preſerued.
               5. A moſt happy kinde of regiment vnder which the Saints are: euen ſuch an one as the members of an head are vnder. An head ruleth the body not as a cruell lord and tyrant, rigorouſly, 5. Difference betwixt in humanely, baſely, and ſlauiſhly, but meekely, gently, Chriſt gouerning the Saints and the world. with great compaſſion, and fellow-feeling. Euen ſo doth Chriſt, his Church, binding vp that which is broken, healing that which is maimed, directing that which wandreth, and quickning that which is dull; which priuiledge is ſo much the greater becauſe it is proper to the Church. Though he haue a golden ſcepter of grace and fauour to hold out to his Church (as Ahaſh-veroſh held out his to Eſther) yet he hath alſo 
                     Eſt. 5. 2. a rod of iron to breake the men of this world, and to daſh them 
                  
                     Pſal. 2. 9. 
                  in peeces like a potters veſſell. Though he be gone to prepare a place for his Saints, that where he is they may be alſo, yet will 
                  
                     Ioh. 14 3. 
                  he make his enemies his footſtoole.

6. An aſſurance of ſufficient ſupply of all needfull things which 6. Aſſurance of all needfull ſupply. the Saints want, and of ſafe protection from all things hurtfull. For by reaſon of this vnion, Chriſt our head hath a ſenſe of our want and of our ſmart. On this ground he ſaid to them which fed and viſited his members, Ye fed me, ye viſited me: and againe, 
                     Mat. 25. 35. Act. 9. 4. to Saul that perſecuted his members, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?
               
               
                  Obiect. How is it then, that the Saints want many things, Why Chriſt ſuffereth the Saints to want, and ſuffer. and oft ſuffer much ſmart, and hurt?
               
                  Anſw. Chriſt in his wiſdome ſeeth it behouefull that they ſhould want, and feele ſmart (and that we are to be perſwaded of) or elſe he would not ſuffer them to want or feele that which they doe. Wherefore in all need, in euery diſtreſſe and danger, let vs lift vp our head to this our head.
               
               7. A right to all that Adam loſt. For Chriſt is the heire of all, (the 
                  7. Saints haue a right to what Adam loſt. 
                  earth is the Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof) yea as mediator and head of the Church is he heire of all: his body therfore hath a right to all. On this ground the Apoſtle ſaith, All things are 
                  
                     Heb. 1. 2. 
                  yours. So as the Saints & only the Saints can with good conſcience 
                     Pſal. 24 1. vſe the things of this world. They who are not of this 1 Cor. 3. 21. bodie (what right and title ſoeuer they haue before men) are but vſurpers of the things they enioy and vſe. They are like to bankrupts, who being not worth one peny, deceitfully borrow of others, and therewith keepe a great table, decke and furniſh their houſes very ſumptuouſly, put themſelues, wiues and children, into braue apparell, are frolicke and riotous: what is like to be the end of ſuch?
               8. A right to more then Adam euer had: namely, to Chriſt 8. Saints haue a right to Chriſt. See §. 28 himſelfe, and to all that appertaineth vnto him: as to the puritie of his nature, to the perfection of his obedience, the merit of his bloud, the power of his death, the vertue of his reſurrection, the efficacie of his aſcenſion, all is ours: euen as the vnderſtanding, wit, iudgement, ſight, hearing, and all that is in the head, is the bodies: if the Church it ſelfe were of it ſelfe as pure in nature, as perfect in righteouſneſſe, as powerfull ouer death, and deuill, and graue, and hell, as able to riſe from death, and to aſcend into heauen, as Chriſt, it could receiue no greater benefit thereby, then it doth by them in the perſon of

Chriſt: ſo truly and properly is Chriſt himſelfe, and all things appertaining to him, the Churches. What can more be ſaid? what can more be deſired? O bleſſed vnion! bleſſed are they that haue a part therein!
               
                  
                     Queſt. How is it then that the Church is ſo baſely and miſerably Why the Church baſely accounted of. 1 Ioh. 3. 1. reſpected in the world?
                  
                     Anſw. The world knoweth vs not, becauſe it knoweth not Chriſt. It knoweth not Chriſt the head of this body: it knoweth not the body which is Chriſt. Let not vs who know both head and body, the neere vnion which is betwixt them, and the priuiledges which follow thereupon, be danted, neither with the ſcoffes or ſcornes of the world, nor with our owne outward weakneſſes, wants, and calamities. What would he that hath Chriſt, haue more?
               
            
            
               §. 72. Of the priuiledge of our vnion with Chriſt in the time of death.
               
               The priuiledge which the Saints receiue by their vnion with Chriſt in the time of death (euen all that time that paſſeth from the departure of the Saints out of this world vnto the generall Reſurrection) is admirable: for when body and ſoule are ſeuered one from another, neither ſoule nor body are ſeparated from Chriſt, but both remaine vnited to him: euen as, when Chriſts body and ſoule were by death ſeuered one from another, neither his ſoule, nor his body were ſeparated from the Deitie, but both remained vnited thereunto. This inuiolable bond that holdeth the Saints, (yea, euen their very bodies as well as their ſoules) vnited to Chriſt in death, is the benefit of a ſpirituall vnion. If our vnion with Chriſt were corporeall, it could not be ſo.
               
                  
                     Ob. Is it poſſible that the body which is dead ſhould remaine Corruption of the body no hinderance to our vnion with Chriſt. vnited to Chriſt, when as it receiueth no vertue from him?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. If a member of a naturall body may doe ſo, why not a member of the myſticall bodie? That a member of a naturall body may doe ſo, is euident by thoſe who haue an hand, arme, foot, leg, or any other member taken, with a dead palſie: they are ſometimes ſo taken, as thoſe parts receiue no manner of ſenſe, or any vigor, or life from head or heart at all: and yet remaine true members of that body.
                  
                     
2. The very dead bodies conſumed with wormes or otherwiſe, doe receiue a great preſent benefit from their vnion with Chriſt: for by vertue thereof there is a ſubſtance preſerued, and they are kept from deſtruction: there is nothing deſtroied in the Saints by death, but that which if it were not deſtroied, would make them moſt miſerable, namely ſinne: that is vtterly, totally, finally deſtroied in them, and all the concomitances thereof, which are all manner of infirmities: but the rotting of the body, is but as the rotting of corne in the earth, 1 Cor. 15. 36. that it may ariſe a more glorious bodie. The metaphor of ſleepe, 
                     1 Theſ 4. 13. attributed to the Saints when they die, ſheweth that their bodies are not vtterly deſtroied.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. The bodies of all men, euen of thoſe that are not Difference betwixt the preſeruation of the Saints bodies and others in the graue. of this vnion, are preſerued from vtter deſtruction. This therefore is no benefit of our vnion with Chriſt.
                  
                     Anſw. Though in the generall thing it ſelfe, which is a preſeruation of the ſubſtance of the body, the ſame thing befalleth the Saints and the wicked: yet the meanes whereby both are preſerued, and the end why they are preſerued is farre different.
                  1. The Saints are preſerued by a ſecret influence proceeding 1 Theſ. 4. 14, 16. from Chriſt, as an head: in which reſpect they are ſaid to ſleepe in Ieſus, and to be dead in Chriſt. But the wicked are reſerued by an Almightie power of Chriſt, as a terrible Lord and ſeuere Iudge.
                  2. The bodies of the Saints are preſerued to enioy eternall glory together with their ſoules: but the bodies of the wicked are reſerued to be tormented in hell.
                  In regard of theſe differēces, the graue is as a bed to the Saints, 
                        Iſa. 57. 2. for them quietly to ſleepe therein free from all diſturbance till the day of reſurrection: but it is a priſon to the wicked to hold them faſt againſt the great Day of Aſſiſe, that at Doomes day they may be brought to appeare at the barre of Gods iudgement ſeat, and there receiue the ſentence of condemnation.
               
            
            
               §. 73. Of the priuiledge of our vnion with Chriſt after death.
               
               The priuiledge which the Saints by vertue of their vnion with Chriſt receiue after death, farre ſurpaſſeth all before. It may be drawne to two heads.

                     
                        
1. Their Reſurrection.
                     2. Their glory in heauen.
                  
               
               That which was before ſaid of the difference betwixt the preſeruation of the bodies of the Saints and wicked in death, may be applied to the difference of their Reſurrection.
               Reſurrection ſimply in it ſelfe is not the priuiledge of the Saints, but Reſurrection of life: to the wicked appertaineth the 
                     Ioh. 5. 29. 
                  Reſurrection of condemnation. The benefit of Reſurrection ariſeth from the glory which followeth therupon in heauen. That glory hath the Apoſtle excellently ſet forth §. 49, 50. &c.
                   before verſ. 27.
            
            
               §. 74. Of the duties which are required of the Saints by vertue of their union with Chriſt.
               
               The myſterie of our vnion with Chriſt, as it is a matter of great comfort, and incouragement (which ariſeth from the forenamed priuiledges) ſo alſo is it a matter of direction and inſtigation vnto vs for the performing of ſundry duties, whereof they who deſire aſſurance of the forenamed priuiledges, and comfort by them, muſt be carefull and conſcionable. Some of the moſt principall of thoſe duties are theſe.
               1. Confidence in Chriſt. Chriſt being our head, ſo mighty, 
                     Heb. 3. 6. ſo wiſe, ſo tender, euery way ſo ſufficient an head as he is, we ſhould highly diſhonour him, if we ſhould not wholly and only repoſe our ſelues vpon him for euery good thing, and againſt euery euill.
               2. Subiection anſwerable to his manner of gouerning vs. 
                     Mat. 6. 10. Chriſtus habet ſanctos voluntate, peccatores verò neceſſitate ſibi ſubiectos.
                   The world is ſubiect to Chriſt perforce, as he is an abſolute and Almighty Lord: but he gouerning vs as an head, we muſt be ſubiect vnto him as members, willingly, and readily. What member will riſe vp, and rebell againſt the head? yea, what member is not as ready to obey, as the head to command? 
                     Hier. in Eph. 1.
               
               3. A cleanſing of our ſelues from all filthineſſe of fleſh and 2 Cor. 7. 1. ſpirit. Shall we defile the members of Chriſt? The ſinnes of the 1 Cor. 6. 15. Saints are in this reſpect the more hainous becauſe that body, euen Chriſt, whereof they are members, is defiled thereby. Wherefore in regard of Chriſt the head, of other Saints their fellow members, and of themſelues, muſt all that profeſſe themſelues to be of this bodie be watchfull ouer themſelues, and cleanſe themſelues from all filthineſſe. Otherwiſe

they giue iuſt occaſion to thinke that they are no members of this bodie. If a Lions foot, or Beares paw were held out, and ſaid to be the member of a man, would any beleeue it? Can we then thinke that worldlings, drunkards, profane, riotous, vncleane perſons, and ſuch like limbs of the Deuill, are members of Chriſt?
               4. A conformitie vnto the image of Chriſt in true holineſſe 
                     Epheſ. 4. 24. and righteouſneſſe. It is not therefore ſufficient for the members of Chriſt to abſtaine from polluting themſelues, for they are created in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good works. He that abideth in 
                  
                     Epheſ. 210. 
                  me (ſaith Chriſt) and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit. 
                  
                     Ioh. 15. 5.
               
               5. Heauenly affections. If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of 
                  
                     Col. 3. 1, 2. 
                  God. Set your affections on things aboue, and not on things on the earth. Where our head is, there alſo ought our heart to be. Earthly affections come not from that head which is in heauen: nor from that Spirit which proceedeth from him. They 
                  
                     Rom. 8. 5. 
                  who are after the ſpirit minde the things of the ſpirit.
               
               6. Courage againſt death: ſeeing that in death we are Chriſts, what cauſe haue we to feare death? Be not afraid of 
                  
                     Luke 12. 4. 
                  them that kill the body, and after that, haue no more that they can doe. The ancient worthies would not accept deliuerance, that 
                  
                     Heb. 11. 35. 
                  they might obtaine a better reſurrection.
               
               Hitherto of the vnion it ſelfe. The meanes of effecting it, remaine to be handled.
            
            
               § 75. Of their regeneration who are members of Chriſt.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 30.
                  —Of his fleſh, and of his bones.
               
               This clauſe declareth the meanes whereby we come to be members of Chriſt, namely by receiuing a new being from Chriſt, which is to be, not of the fleſh, and of the bones of Adam, but of the fleſh and of the bones of Chriſt, which being ſpiritually taken, as hath beene expounded §. 70. before, ſheweth that
               
                  They who are true members of Chriſt body, are truly regenerate. 
                  Doct. 
                  If any be in Chriſt he is a new creature: theſe words are ſo 2 Cor. 5. 17. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . laid downe by the Apoſtle, as they ſerue both for a demonſtration, and an exhortation (he is, or let him be a new creature)
                  
neither is expreſſed, but either, or both may be vnderſtood. As many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt (that is, made 
                     Gal. 3. 27. members of this body) haue put on Chriſt, (that is, haue beene borne againe) the firſt branch noteth out our incorporation into Chriſt, the latter our regeneration.
               This ſecond man, and laſt Adam Chriſt Ieſus is a quickning 
                  Reaſon. 
                  ſpirit: he diffuſeth life and grace into all his members: if his 1 Cor. 15. 45. Rom. 8. 11. ſpirit be in vs, it will quicken our mortall bodies. If the head of our naturall bodies conueigh ſenſe into all our members: if the root of a tree diffuſe ſap into all the branches: ſhall not Chriſt much more giue life to all his members?
               This then is a matter of triall, whereby we may proue whether Vſe. indeed we are of this body or no, and ſo haue a true right Triall whether we be members of Chriſt. to the forenamed priuiledges. Many boaſt of this honour that they are members of Chriſts body, and yet are not of his fleſh and of his bones: they haue no other being, then what they receiued from their parents. Theſe vaine profeſſors are like woodden legs, or armes on a man, which may be couered ouer with hoſe and ſleeues for a time, but ſhall not be raiſed at the reſurrection with the other parts of the mans body: ſo neither ſhall thoſe profeſſors be raiſed to glory with Chriſt, though they may be couered ouer with the hoſe and ſleeues of profeſſion, and thereby ſeeme to be members.
            
            
               §. 76. Of the author of our regeneration Chriſt.

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  and of HIS bones) ſheweth that
               
                  Regeneration is of Chriſt. 
                  
                     Ioh. 5. 21. 
                  The Sonne quickneth whom he will. 
                  Doctr.
               
               
                  
                     Object. This worke is attributed in Scripture to the 1 Pet. 1. 3. Father, to the 
                        Ioh. 3. 5. Spirit, to the 
                        Iam. 1. 18. word, and to the 1 Cor. 4. 15. Miniſters of the word.
                  
                     Anſw. Chriſt may very well ſtand with all theſe. The three perſons in Trinitie are all one: One in nature and eſſence: 
                        Philem. verſ. 10. The worke of the three perſons in our regeneration. One in will and conſent: One in vertue and power: what the one doth the other doth alſo. Yet becauſe there is a difference in their manner of working, this worke (as other workes) is diſtinctly attributed to each of them.
                  The Father is (as I may ſo ſpeake) the beginner of this

worke. His will it was that his Sonne ſhould be the head of a bodie, and that there ſhould members be made fit for that head, and haue a new being (of his owne will begat he vs) for 
                        Iam. 1. 18. this end he ſent his Sonne into the world to be made fleſh. The Sonne put in execution the will of his Father: he tooke fleſh vpon him, that we might be of his fleſh. Thus ſaith Chriſt of himſelfe, I came downe from heauen to doe the will of him that 
                     
                        Joh. 6. 38, 39. 
                     ſent me; And this is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath giuen me I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it vp againe at the laſt day. The Spirit applieth vnto vs the vertue and efficacie of the fleſh of Chriſt, and ſo finiſherh this bleſſed worke. It is the Spirit that quickneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing, 
                     
                        Ioh. 6. 63. namely, of it ſelfe without the Spirit.
                  Thus we ſee that the applying of this worke of regeneration vnto Chriſt, excludeth not the worke of the Father, or of the Holy Ghoſt therein, but excludeth the worke of man: ſo as it is not of our ſelues, nor of our parents, nor of any other man: for we are borne not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God: in which reſpect our new birth 
                        Ioh. 1. 13. is ſaid to be 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     from aboue.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. How is it then attributed to the word, and to the 
                        Ioh. 3. 3. miniſterie of man? How regeneration is attributed to the word, and to Miniſters thereof.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. As vnto inſtruments which the Lord is pleaſed to vſe: Of the word it is ſaid, God hath begotten vs with the word: of himſelfe a Miniſter thus ſaith the Apoſtle, In Chriſt Ieſus I haue begotten you: ſo as God and Chriſt are ioyned 
                        Iam. 1. 18. with theſe inſtruments, or elſe they are no whit powerfull and 1 Cor. 4. 15. effectuall for ſo great a worke: for neither is he that planteth any 
                     1 Cor. 3. 7. 
                     thing, nor he that watreth: but God that giueth the increaſe.
                  
                  The worke of regeneration is a new creation, a diuine Reaſon. worke, aboue humane ſtraine. It muſt therefore be wrought by the Lord, or it cannot be wrought at all.
                  This is to be noted both of thoſe that haue not yet aſſurance Uſe. of this bleſſed worke wrought in them: and alſo of thoſe who haue aſſurance thereof.
                  The former may here learne whither to haue recourſe for it: namely, to him who came downe from heauen for that purpoſe, and who ſaith, Him that commeth vnto me I will in no wiſe 
                     
                        Ioh. 6. 37.
                     
                     caſt out. In all the meanes that we vſe, let vs looke vp vnto him, and ſeeke a bleſſing of him.
                  The latter muſt with the tenth leper returne backe vnto 
                        Luke 17. 16. Chriſt, and glorifie God. Whatſoeuer the meanes were, or whoſoeuer the Miniſter was, the praiſe and glorie of all muſt be giuen to him.
               
            
            
               §. 77. Of the matter of our regeneration, Chriſt.
               
               The prepoſition (OF) twice ſet downe (OF his fleſh, and 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . OF his bones) being a proper note of the materiall cauſe, ſheweth that
               
                  Chriſt is not only the author, but the matter alſo of our new birth. The new ſpirituall being which the Saints haue, commeth out of him. 
                     Col. 2. 19. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  From him all the bodie hauing nouriſhment increaſeth with the increaſe of God. In this reſpect we are ſaid to be 
                     Epheſ. 1. 3. bleſſed with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt. The metaphor of a 
                     Joh 15. 5. 
                  vine, which Chriſt taketh vnto himſelfe, proueth alſo as much: ſo doe theſe phraſes, 
                     Ioh. 6. 55. 
                  My fleſh is meat indeed, my bloud is drinke indeed.
               
               This Chriſt commeth to be by his incarnation. God in himſelfe is as a bottomleſſe and a cloſed fountaine: from him Reaſon. immediately we can receiue nothing. But Chriſt made fleſh is 
                     Zach. 13. 1. 
                  a fountaine opened: 
                  
                     Col. 1. 19. 
                  In him all fulneſſe dwelleth. 
                  
                     Ioh. 1. 16. 
                  And of him haue all we receiued, euen grace for grace.
               
               Behold here the benefit of Chriſts incarnation: by his taking 1 Vſe:
                   part of our mortall fleſh, are we made partakers of his ſpirituall fleſh, namely, of that ſpirituall life and grace which commeth from him, who was made fleſh, to conuey the ſame into vs. To ſtrengthen our faith the more firmly herein, the Lord hath inſtituted the holy Communion of his bodie and bloud. With what conſcience, reuerence, and confidence, ought this bleſſed Sacrament to be celebrated?
               By this Doctrine we may further learne how to ſeeke euery 2. Vſe.
                   thing at Gods hands which we deſire to obtaine, and how to offer that ſacrifice of praiſe vnto God, which wee would haue 
                     Ioh. 16. 23. to be accepted; namely in and through Ieſus Chriſt, by whom 
                     Heb. 13. 15. only we haue all that communion which we haue with God. 
                     Col. 3. 17. Well therefore doth the Church conclude all her formes of

Prayers and Praiſes with this, or ſuch a like clauſe, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.
               
            
            
               §. 78. Of the excellency of Regeneration.
               
               The particular matter of our regeneration (the fleſh and bones of Chriſt) here expreſſed, ſheweth that
               
                  Regeneration is a moſt excellent worke. The excellencie hereof Doctr. will the better appeare, if we compare it with the great and glorious worke of our creation, and ſhew how farre it ſurpaſſeth it: wherein I will hold cloſe to this metaphor, and touch Difference betwixt regeneration and creation. no other differences then it doth point out vnto vs.
               1. In our creation Chriſt was only a worker: but he is the verie matter of our Regeneration, we are of his fleſh.
               
               2. The relation that then was betwixt Chriſt and man,
               
                  
                     
                        was
                        
                           Creator,
                        
                        but here
                        
                           Head,
                        
                        
                           We are members of his bodie.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Creature,
                        
                         
                        
                           Bodie,
                        
                         
                         
                     
                  
               
               The bond is now much neerer.
               3. The being which then we had, was from Adam: But the being which now we haue is from Chriſt, of HIS fleſh.
               
               4. That being was but naturall. This is ſpirituall: for that 
                  
                     Ioh. 3. 6. 
                  which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit.
               
               5. Then our being was different from Chriſts: but now it is the verie ſame with Chriſts, Of his fleſh.
               
               6. Then might man cleane fall from that eſtate wherein he was created (as he did) and yet Chriſt remaine as he was. Now it cannot be ſo. For if any of the Saints now fall away, either Chriſt muſt fall with them, or they muſt be pulled from Chriſt, and ſo Chriſt remaine a maimed bodie.
               Behold the riches of Gods mercie. One might thinke it The riches of Gods mercie. ſufficient, and more then man could euer haue beene thankfull enough for, that God at firſt created man after his owne image in a moſt happie eſtate. From which when we wittingly and wilfully fell, God might iuſtly haue left vs, as he did the euill Angels. But he hath not only reſtored vs againe to that former eſtate, but aduanced vs to a farre more excellent and glorious eſtate: wherein his goodneſſe appeareth to be as his greatneſſe, infinite, incomprehenſible. Who can ſufficiently ſet it forth? For as the heauen is high aboue the earth, ſo great 
                  
                     Pſal. 103. 11. 
                  is his mercie toward them that feare him.
               
            
            
               
               §. 79. Of the ancient Law of mariage.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 31.
                  For this cauſe ſhall a man leaue his father and mother, and ſhall be ioyned vnto his wife: and they two ſhall be one fleſh.
               
               THe ſame points which were before laid downe, concerning the neere vnion of man and wife, and of Chriſt and the Church, are here further confirmed by the ancient law of mariage: which the Apoſtle doth the rather mention, becauſe it followeth vpon that text, whereunto he alluded in the former verſe. For when Moſes had alledged theſe words of Adam concerning Eue, This is bone of my bones, and fleſh of my fleſh, he 
                     Gen. 2. 23, 24. addeth this law, Therefore ſhall a man leaue his father, &c. In this place theſe words haue both a literall and a myſticall ſenſe. A literall of man and wife. A myſticall of Chriſt and the Church. The maine thing which the Apoſtle aimeth at, is to Inference. ſhew how neerely man and wife are linked together: that thereby they may the rathet be moued to performe thoſe mutuall and ſeuerall duties which they owe each to other. But becauſe he propounded to husbands and wiues the examples of Chriſt and the Church, as patternes and motiues to them, to doe their dutie, he applieth that which was firſt ſpoken of man and wife, vnto Chriſt and his Church, to ſhew that there being ſo fit a reſemblance betwixt theſe two couples, the patterne propounded is the more pertinent to the purpoſe, and the reaſon enforced from thence the more forcible.
               Becauſe the opening of the literall ſenſe will giue great light to the myſterie, I will firſt handle this text according to the meaning of the letter.
               The firſt clauſe (for this cauſe) implieth a neceſſarie connexion 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . with that which went before. The neere vnion of man and wife, as well as of Chriſt and his Church, was before noted. A wife was ſaid to be as the 
                     Verſ. 28. Gen. 2. 23. 
                  bodie of a man, yea as 
                     Verſ. 28. Gen. 2. 23. 
                  himſelfe. Adam called her his fleſh and bones. Hereupon both Moſes and Paul inferre, Therefore, or, For this cauſe ſhall a man leaue father. Becauſe man and wife are ſo neere by Gods

inſtitution, they muſt alſo be moſt deare each to other in their mutuall affection.
               The Man (meaning an husband) is here in particular mentioned, Meaning of the words. becauſe at the firſt making of this Law the woman was brought to him to ſee how he would like her: and hauing caſt his affection on her, he was to be bound hereby to continue that good liking towards her: as alſo becauſe of the preheminencie which man hath aboue his wife. Yet is not the man only tied hereby, but the wife alſo: the nature and rule of relation requireth as much: if a man muſt inſeparably cleaue to his wife, the wife muſt anſwerably cleaue to her husband.
               Theſe words (ſhall leaue father and mother) are neither generally to be taken of all duties, as if no dutie were to be performed to parents by children after they are maried: nor ſimply, as if indeed parents were vtterly to be forſaken: but they are meant,
               1. Of that daily ſeruice which children vnder their parents gouernment performe vnto them, ſeeking to pleaſe them in all things. When children are maried, then their daily attendance muſt be vpon their wiues, or husbands, taking care how 1 Cor. 7. 33, 34. to pleaſe them.
               2. Of erecting a new family: for which end their parents houſe muſt be left, and the husband and wife muſt dwell each with other.
               3. Of the difference to be put betwixt parents, and wife or huſband. So as if by any ineuitable occaſion it ſhould ſo fall out, that a man muſt leaue his parent, or his wife (as in caſe parent and wife were both giuing vp the Ghoſt, and in places ſo farre remote, as the husband could not poſſibly be with both, yet both inſtantly deſired his companie) by this Law he muſt leaue his parent, and cleaue to his wife.
               Hereby then the bond of mariage is declared to be the moſt inuiolable bond that can be. For all men know, that the bond betwixt parent and childe is a firme and inuiolable bond: but the bond betwixt husband and wife is more firme and inuiolable.
               To ſet forth the firmneſſe of the mariage bond he addeth this Emphacicall phraſe, ſhall be ioyned, (or as the word properly,

cording to the naturall notation thereof ſignifieth, ſhall be glued) 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Glue. to his wife. Things well glued together are as faſt, firme, and cloſe as if they were one intire peece. Yea we obſerue by experience that a table will oft times cleaue in the whole wood, before it will part aſunder where it is glued: ſo as an husband ought to be as firme to his wife as to himſelfe: and ſhe to him.
               Fitly doth this agree with that which followeth (they two ſhall be one fleſh) Our Engliſh cannot well expreſſe the Greeke 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . in good ſenſe word for word (which is thus, they two ſhall beinto, or in one fleſh) the meaning is, They which were two before mariage, by the bond of mariage are brought into one fleſh, to be euen as one fleſh: as neerely vnited, as the parts of the ſame body, and the ſame fleſh. This vnitie is not in regard of carnall copulation (for if they be maried they are one fleſh, 
                  
                     Matrimonium non facit coitus, ſed voluntas. Chryſoſt. in Mat. hom. 32. though they neuer know one another) nor in regard of procreation, because one childe commeth from them both (for though they neuer haue childe, yet are they one fleſh) but in regard of Gods inſtitution, who hath ſet it downe for a law, and as another nature, that man and wife ſhould be ſo neere one to another. Their conſent in mariage (by vertue of Gods inſtitution) maketh them to be one fleſh.
               
               Well doth our Engliſh note the emphaſis of the originall in this particle THEY (they two) which ſheweth that the bond 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . of mariage knitteth only two together: one man, and one woman, and no more.
               This Law ſetteth forth the Vnion betwixt man and wife. 
                  Summe.
               
               Therein three things are noted concerning the ſtate of mariage.
               1. The praeeminencie of it (a man ſhall leaue father and mother.)
               
               2. The firmneſſe of it (and be ioyned to his wife.)
               
               3. The neereneſſe of it (they two ſhall be one fleſh.)
               
            
            
               §. 80. Of preferring husband or wife before parents.
               
               The firſt point ſheweth, that
               
                  A wife, or an husband muſt be preferred before parents. The Doct. examples of 
                     Gen. 31. 14. 
                  Leah and Rachel, yea and of 1 Sam. 19. 11 
                  Micol, are commendable in this reſpect.
               
                  
1. The bond of mariage is more ancient, more firme, more Reaſon. neere. There was husband and wife before there was parent and child: and there is a time when parents & children may depart one from another, and that while both liue: but no time, wherein man and wife may part aſunder till death part them. And children though they come from the fleſh of their parents, yet are made two (ſo as of one are two) but husbands and wiues though they were two before, yet are made one (ſo as of two is one.)
               
               What wrong then doe ſuch parents vnto their children, as Vſe. keepe them, euen after they are maried, ſo ſtrait vnder ſubiection, Parents may not keepe their children being maried too ſtraight. as they cannot freely performe ſuch duty as they ought to their husband, or their wife? This is more then a parents authority reacheth vnto. Yet many thinke that their children owe as much ſeruice to them after they are maried as before: which is directly againſt this law.
               Greater is the wrong, and more ſinfull is the practiſe of Nor keepe them from husband or wife. ſuch as keepe their children from their husbands, or from their wiues. The match (ſay they) falleth out much worſe then we looked for. But this ſhould haue beene looked to more carefully before hand. After mariage it is too late to ſeeke ſuch a redreſſe.
               On the other ſide, there be many children who ſo reſpect Children may not preferre their parents before huſband or wife. Apud Romanos ſponſa obtecta flammeo capite quum extuliſſet pedem è paternis aedibus, vertebatur in gyrum, itaque duceb

                   their parents, as they neglect their husband or their wife. Some husbands will beſtow what they can on their parents, and keepe their wiues very bare, ſuffering them to want neceſſaries; not caring how they vex and grieue them ſo they pleaſe their parents. Some wiues alſo will priuily purloine from their husbands to beſtow on their parents.
               Others can neuer tarrie out of their parents houſes, but as oft as they can, goe thither. The ancient Romans, to ſhew how vnmeet this was, had a cuſtome to couer the brides face with a yellow veile, and ſo ſoone as ſhe was out of her fathers houſe to turne her about and about, and ſo to carrie her to the houſe of her husband, that ſhe might not know the way to her fathers houſe againe. All thoſe pretenſes of loue to parents are more prepoſterous then pious: and naturall affection beareth more ſway in ſuch, then true religion. Their pretence

of piety to parents is no ruſt excuſe for that iniury they doe to husband and wife.
            
            
               §. 81. Of the firmneſſe of the matrimoniall bond.
               
               The ſecond point concerning the firmneſſe of the mariage knot in theſe words (ſhall be ioyned to his wife) affor deth two doctrines.
               1. Man and wife muſt aſſociate themſelues together by continuall 
                  See Treat. 2. part. 2. §. 14. 
                  cohabitation: for this end they leaue their parents family, and erect a new family.
               2. Man and wife are ioyned together by an inuiolable bond. It See Treat. 2. part. 2 §. 2. muſt neuer be cut aſunder till death cut it. Body and ſoule muſt be ſeuered one from another before husband and wife.
               Be carefull therefore to preſerue this indiſſoluble knot: and ſo liue together, as with comfort you may liue together, becauſe you may not part.
            
            
               §. 82. Of two only to be ioyned together in mariage.
               
               The third point concerning the neereneſſe of man and wife, in theſe words (they two ſhall be one fleſh) affordeth two other doctrines.
               1. Mariage can be but betwixt two, one man, and one woman: for it is impoſſible that more then two ſhould ſo neerely, and firmely be ioyned together, as man and wife are. Euery word almoſt in this law proueth this doctrine. For it ſaith a man, not men: to a wife, not to wiues: to his wife, not to anothers wife: two, not more then two: they two, not any two: one fleſh, not many fleſhes.
               
                  
                     Obiect. This particle (two) is not in the law as Moſes recordeth 
                        Gen. 2. 24. it.
                  
                     Anſw. It is there neceſſarily implied, for at that time there were but two in the world: God then ſpeaking of them, meaneth but two. The ſame ſpirit that guided Moſes, guided alſo the 
                        Mat. 19. 5. Euangeliſts, and the 1 Cor. 6. 16. Apoſtles: ſo as by their inſerting of this particle (two) it is certaine that it was intended by Moſes: as the particle (only) which Chriſt putteth into this text, 
                        Deut. 6. 13. Mat. 4. 10. 
                     him only ſhalt thou ſerue.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. Why did God at firſt make but one man, and one woman?
                  
                     
                     Anſw. The 
                        Mal. 2. 15. Prophet anſwereth, that he might ſeeke a godly ſeed.
                  
                  If therefore there be more then two, it is an adulterous ſeed which proceedeth from thence.
               
            
            
               §. 83. Of Polygamy and Bigamy.
               
               Can Polygamy (the hauing of many wiues) or Bigamy (the hauing of two wiues at once) haue any good warrant againſt ſuch an expreſſe law? Are not both of them againſt the firſt inſtitution of mariage, ſo as we may ſay, 
                     Mat. 19. 8. 
                  from the beginning it was not ſo? Yea alſo and againſt 
                     Deut. 17. 17. Leu. 18. 18. other particular lawes? 
                     Gen. 4. 19. Magis pertinere ad nuptiarum bonum, non vnum & multas, ſed vnum & vnam, ſatis indicat ipſa prima diuinitus facta coniugum copula, &c. Aug. de Nupt. & concup. l. 1. c. 9. Gen. 2. 18. Gen. 16. 5. & 21. 11. 
                  Lamech one of Cains curſed ſtocke was the firſt that we read of to haue preſumed againſt that ancient law.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Afterwards many Patriarkes, and other Saints tooke that liberty vnto themſelues.
                  
                     Anſw. It was their ſinne, and a great blemiſh in them. The common error of the time, & their vnſatiable deſire of increaſe made them fall into it. Many inconueniences followed thereupon: neither can it be thought but that much miſchiefe muſt needes follow vpon hauing more wiues then one: for whereas God at firſt made a wife to be as an helpe vnto man, two, or more wiues cannot but be a great griefe and vexation vnto him by reaſon of that emulation that is betwixt them. Through Hagars meanes was Sarah ſtirred againſt Abraham, and Abraham grieued at Sarahs words. Though Leah and Rachel were ſiſters, yet great were their emulations: the like whereof is noted of Peninnah and many others.
                  Conſidering the hainouſneſſe of this ſinne, our lawes 
                        Stat. 1. Iacob. 11. haue iuſtly made it felony for a man to haue more wiues then one, or a woman more husbands.
               
            
            
               §. 84. Of the neere coniunction of man and wife together.
               
               2. The neereſt of all other are husband and wife one to another. 
                  Doctr. Euery clauſe in the forenamed law proueth as much.
               1. Parents muſt be left for wife: who neerer then parent and childe? if man and wife be neerer then the neereſt, then they are the neereſt of all.
               2. A man is glued to his wife. This metaphor ſetteth forth the neerneſſe of a thing as well as the firmneſſe of it: for things glued together are as one intire thing.
               
                  
3. Man and wife are one fleſh: many of one are made two, but no two ſo neerely and truly made one as man and wife.
               As God hath limited a propinquity, and vnity of things, so Reaſon. are they to be accounted: but God hath thus neerely knit man and wife together, and made them one fleſh. Thoſe whom 
                  
                     Mat. 19. 6. GOD hath ioyned together, ſaith Chriſt of man and wife: in which reſpect matrimoniall coniunction is called the couenant 
                  
                     Pro. 2. 17. 
                  of God: ſo as this couenant cannot be releaſed by any, no not by the mutuall conſent of man and wife (Thoſe whom GOD hath ioyned together, let no man put aſunder) yet may many other couenants made betwixt partie and partie, be releaſed and diſanulled by mutuall conſent of both parties.
               1. This ſheweth that the tranſgreſſions of man and wife Vſes. one againſt another are of all the moſt hainous, more then of 1. Mutuall tranſgreſſions of man and wife moſt hainous. friend, fellow, brother, childe, parent or any other. Who would not cry fie vpon that child that hates his parent, or fie vpon that parent that hates his childe? The heathen & ſauages would not thinke them worthy of humane ſociety. What then may be thought of the man that hateth his wife, or the wife that hateth her husband? Apply this to all other tranſgreſſions: and well note how the Lord is a witneſſe thereof. 
                     Mal. 2. 14.
               
               2. This alſo ſheweth how monſtrous a thing it is to ſow 2. Monſtrous to make debate betwixt man and wife. any ſeeds of diſcord, and ſtirre debate betwixt man and wife. The deuils inſtruments they are therein, and a diabolicall ſpirit is in them. For Satan moſt laboureth to vnlooſe thoſe knots which the Lord knitteth moſt firmly. Children of ſeuerall venters, and ſeuerall friends of each partie, are much faultie herein. Curſed be they all before the Lord.
               
               3. 1 Sam. 26. 19. This neere coniunction betwixt man and wife is a great 3. All duties betwixt man and wife to be cheerefully performed. Iſa. 58. 7. motiue to ſtirre them both vp, cheerefully to performe all the duties which God requireth of either of them. For thereby they doe dutie, and ſhew kindneſſe to their owne fleſh. No man may hide himſelfe from his owne fleſh at large: that is, no man may neglect any dutie of mercie, or iuſtice to his neighbour who is of the ſame ſtocke that he is: ſhall then an husband or wife hide themſelues from one another who in the neereſt reſpect that poſſibly can be are one fleſh? not becauſe they come from one fleſh, but becauſe they come

               §. 85. Of the matrimoniall coniunction of Chriſt and the Church.
               
               The forenamed ancient mariage law is here applied myſtically 
                     Quod per hiſtoriam impletum eſt in Adam, per prophetiam ſignificat Chriſtum qui reliquit patrem, &c. Aug. de Gen. lib. 2. c. 24. to Chriſt and the Church, as is euident by the next verſe, where the Apoſtle hauing reference to this verſe ſaith, This is a great myſterie. There is then a myſterie contained in it. But of what, or of whom is that myſterie? The Apoſtle himſelfe maketh anſwer, in theſe words: I ſpeake concerning Chriſt and the Church.
               
               The myſterie in generall is this,
               
                  Chriſt and the Church are to one another as husband and wife.
               
               The particulars of this myſterie are theſe.
               
                  
                     
                        The matrimoniall coniunction betwixt Chriſt & the Church is a moſt
                        Preheminent
                        coniunction.

               Firſt of the generall.
               The many eſpouſall, and matrimoniall titles, which in Scripture are giuen to Chriſt and the Church in mutuall relation of one to another, euidently ſhew that they are ioyned together by the honourable, inſeparable and inuiolable bond of mariage: He is ſtiled a 
                     Ioh. 3. 29. 
                  Bridegroome, ſhe a Bride: he 
                     Cant. 1. 13, 15. 
                  Welbeloued, ſhe Loue: he an 2 Cor. 11. 2. 
                  Husband, ſhe a Wife: he an 
                     Eph. 5. 23. 
                  Head, ſhe the Body: both 
                     & verſ. 31. 
                  one fleſh.
               
               2. All things requiſite to ioyne man and wife together, doe fitly concurre betwixt Chriſt and the Church.
               1. They are perſons fit to be ioyned. Though Chriſt be the things which make Chriſt and the Church fit to be husband and wife. God, yet for 
                     Ioh. 17. 19. this end he became man: and though the Church were impure, yet for this end is ſhe cleanſed and ſanctified.
               2. They haue their parents conſent: for God is the 
                     Ioh. 20. 17. common father of both. And God hath giuen 
                     Rom. 8. 32. Chriſt to the Church, and the 
                     Ioh. 6. 39. Church to Chriſt.
               3. They haue giuen their 
                     Cant. 2. 16. mutuall conſent each to other.
               4. He 
                     Eph. 5. 23, 24. beareth an husband like affection to her, and ſhe is willing to yeeld a wife-like ſubiection to him.
               
                  
5. He hath 
                     Eph. 4 8. giuen her many fauours and gifts as pledges of his loue: and ſhe in teſtimony of her faithfulneſſe was vnder the Law circumciſed, and is vnder the Goſpell baptized: and doth binde her ſelfe with all the ſacred bonds and couenants which God to that purpoſe hath ſanctified.
               6. He hath prepared 
                     Ioh. 14. 3. places of habitation for them both together, and 
                     Reu. 22. 17, 20. ſhe earneſtly deſireth to be with him.
               Behold another euidence of Chriſts admirable loue to the 1. Vſe.
                   Church, and of the neere vnion betwixt Chriſt and her. The An high fauour to be the ſpouſe to Chriſt. former was that ſhe was his body. This, that ſhe is his wife: well might the Church ſay as Abigaile did, Behold, let thine handmaid be a ſeruant to waſh the feet of the ſeruants of my 
                  1 Sam. 25. 41. 
                  Lord: and as the prodigall child, Make me as one of thine hired 
                  
                     Luk. 15. 19. 
                  ſeruants: or as the Baptiſt, I am not worthy to ſtoope downe to 
                  
                     Mar. 1. 7. 
                  vnlooſe thy ſhoe-latchets. What a fauour then is it to be made his ſpouſe, his wife, his Queene. Great was the fauour which Ahaſh-veroſh ſhewed to Eſther, when he made her his wife: he was a great Monarch, reigning from India to Ethiopia ouer 127 prouinces: but Eſther was a poore orphane and captiue: yet was not this fauour comparable to Chriſts: for there was no ſuch diſparity and inequality betwixt Ahaſh-veroſh and Eſther, as betwixt Chriſt and the Church: neither is Eſthers aduancement to be compared with the Churches: and yet there was ſome cauſe in Eſther to moue Ahaſh-veroſh to doe what he did, for ſhe was very beautifull, and louely, and worthy to be loued: but §. 33, 34. in the Church when Chriſt firſt caſt his loue on her, there was no ſuch thing. No patterne of loue can be giuen any way comparable to this.
               Let the Church therefore, and all that profeſſe themſelues 2. Vſe.
                   to be of the Church, take ſuch notice hereof, as they may endeuour 
                     Direction. How Chriſts ſpouſe muſt cary her ſelfe. to carry themſelues worthy of this honour and aduancement: not to wax proud and inſolent thereupon, but to deſpiſe all vaine and worldly toies: to anſwer loue with loue, as the Church is ſet forth in Salomons ſong; to be ſubiect to her husband, to reuerence and obey him, and to performe all duties appertaining to ſuch a wife: ſeeking by all good meanes to maintaine the honour of her place. The Church is made a patterne of dutie to all wiues: if ſhe ſhould faile, greater

inconuenience would follow from thence, then from Vaſhties 
                  
                     Eſt. 1. 16. &c.
                   diſobedience.
               This is the rather to be regarded becauſe it is not only a 3. Vſe.
                   matter of inſtruction but of triall alſo, ſhewing both what they 
                     Triall. Who are Chriſts ſpouſe. which are of the Church ought to doe, and alſo §. 24. what indeed they will doe. Wherefore no prophane perſon that lightly eſteemeth the Lord Ieſus, no Idolater that caſteth his loue on other husbands, no ſwearer or blaſphemer that diſhonoreth the great Name of Ieſus, none that any way are rebellious againſt him, none that hate, ſcorne, ſcoffe, or hurt any of his members, can haue any comfort in this aduancement of the Church, becauſe they haue no part therein, nor right thereunto.
               But great is that comfort which the true Saints may receiue 4. Vſe.
                   therein. For by vertue of this matrimoniall bond, 
                     Conſolation. The priuiledges of Chriſts ſpouſe.
               
               1. Chriſt is made a yoakefellow with his Church, and her companion. Vnder all the burdens which are laid vpon her, he putteth his ſhoulder to make it the more eaſie: yea, the great burdens of Gods wrath, the curſe of the law, and ſinne the cauſe thereof, hath he ſo taken on him, as he hath cleane freed his Church from them, becauſe they would elſe haue cruſhed her downe to hell.
               2. Chriſt is as her champion to anſwer all challenges ſent vnto her, as her aduocate to plead and anſwer all the complaints that ſhall be made againſt her, as her ſuretie to diſcharge all her debts: the Church being couert-baron vnder Chriſt, he is as her ſelfe, all in all for her, and to her.
               3. All his honours, goods, priuiledges are hers: ſhe hath

Able he is to doe all, for he is omnipotent: willing alſo he muſt needs be, becauſe willingly he hath taken vpon him this place: he hath made himſelfe a patterne to other huſbands: will he not then doe that himſelfe which herequireth of others?
               
                  
If euer any wife might receiue comfort in a match, the Church may receiue comfort in this match.
               The benefit of this match will yet more liuely appeare by a particular conſideration of the three forenamed properties of this matrimoniall bond, the preheminencie, firmneſſe, and neereneſſe thereof.
            
            
               §. 86. Of Chriſts leauing his Father and mother for his ſpouſe.
               
               I. The preheminencie of the matrimoniall bond betwixt Chriſt and the Church herein appeareth, that
               
                  Chriſt left his Father and his mother for his ſpouſe the Church. As Chriſt is God, God is his Father; as man, the Virgin Marie was his mother. Now the leauing of his Father muſt be taken only by way of reſemblance, in that he came from the place of his Fathers habitation, to the place where his Spouſe was. The Scripture ſaith, that he was in the boſome of his Father: 
                  
                     Ioh. 1. 18. 
                  by him, as one brought vp with him, his daily delight, reioycing alway 
                  
                     Prou. 8. 30. 
                  before him: yet deſcended he into the loweſt parts of the earth 
                  
                     Epheſ. 4. 9. 
                  where his ſpouſe was. He came out from the Father, and came into 
                  
                     Ioh. 16. 28. 
                  the world.
               
               But truly and properly did he preferre his Spouſe before his mother. For when he was inſtructing his Spouſe, and his mother came to interrupt him, he ſaid to his mother, who is my 
                  
                     Mark. 3. 33, 34. 
                  mother? and to his Spouſe, behold my mother.
               
               Of the Vſe. ſame minde muſt the Church, and all that are of the Church be vnto Chriſt: ſhe muſt forget her owne people, and fathers 
                  
                     Imitation. All to be forſaken for Chriſt. Pſal. 45. 10. 
                  houſe. Seeing Chriſt hath gone before vs, and giuen vs ſo good an example, what an high point of ingratitude would it be for vs, to preferre father, mother, or any other before Chriſt our husband? Note what he ſaith in this caſe, He that loueth 
                  
                     Matth. 10. 37. 
                  father or mother more then me, is not worthie of me. And againe, If any come vnto me, and hate not his father and mother, he cannot 
                  
                     Luke 14. 26. expounded. How parents to be hated for Chriſt. 
                  be mine. To hate here, is to be ſo farre from preferring father & mother before Chriſt, as rather then not to loue Chriſt, to hate father and mother. Or, ſo intirely to loue Chriſt aboue all, as our loue of parents in compariſon thereof to be an hatted. Thus Leui ſaid vnto his father and mother, I haue not ſeene him: 
                  
                     Deut. 33. 9. 
                  for they obſerued the word, and kept the couenant of Chriſt.
               
               
                  
This then is our dutie, that we ſuffer not any naturall affection and dotage on our parents to ſwallow vp that loue we owe to Chriſt, as Pharaohs ill-fauourèd and leane-fleſhed kine eat 
                  
                     Gen. 41. 4. 
                  vp the ſeuen well-fauoured and fat kine. How much leſſe ſhould any loue of this world, of the profits, promotions, or pleaſures of this world, draw away our hearts from Chriſt; ſhould we not rather ſay and doe as the Apoſtles did, Behold, we haue for ſaken 
                  
                     Matth. 19. 27. 
                  all and followed Chriſt?
               
            
            
               §. 87. Of the indiſſoluble vnion betwixt Chriſt and the Church.
               
               II. The firmneſſe of that bond whereby Chriſt and the Church are ſaid to be glued together, is greater and more inuiolable then that whereby man and wife are ioyned together: Death parteth man and wife: but death cannot make a diremption betwixt Chriſt and the Church: ſo as we may well from this metaphor inferre, that Chriſt and the Church are inſeparably 
                  
                     Hoſea 2. 19. 
                  knit together. I will betroth thee vnto me for euer, ſaith Chriſt vnto the Church. The couenant which Chriſt maketh with his Church, is an euerlaſting couenant. The mountaines ſhall depart, 
                  
                     Isa. 61. 8. & 54. 10. 
                  and the hils be remoued, before his kindneſſe ſhall depart from the Church.
               
               The ſtedfaſtneſſe and vnchangeableneſſe of his will, is the Reaſon. only cauſe thereof. Whom he loueth, he loueth vnto the end. 
                  
                     Ioh. 13. 1. 
                  His gifts and calling are without repentance. He is not like the 
                     Rom. 11. 29. hard hearted Iewes, who vpon euerie ſleight occaſion would put away their wiues. The Lord hateth putting away. Though 
                     Mal. 2. 16. therefore the Church, through her weakneſſe, doe depart from him, and play the harlot, yet returne againe to me, ſaith the 
                     Ier. 3. 1. Lord.
               Learne we by this patterne to cleaue cloſe vnto the Lord, 
                     Vſe. Cleaue to Chriſt. which is a dutie moſt due to Chriſt who cleaueth ſo cloſe to vs, and therefore oft 
                     Deut. 10. 20. & 13. 4. Acts 11. 23. expreſſed in the Scripture.
               Three vertues there are which are of ſpeciall vſe to this purpoſe, Faith, Hope, Loue.
               
                  Faith is the hand whereby we lay faſt hold on Chriſt, and as it were knit him to our ſelues, as he by his Spirit knitteth vs to himſelfe. This maketh vs reſt and repoſe our ſelues on him for all needfull things: and not to leaue him for any thing.
               
                  
                  Hope is the anchor, which holdeth vs faſt againſt all the ſtormes of Satan, ſo as they can neuer driue vs out of our harbour, which is the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
               
                  Loue is the glue and ſoader which maketh vs one with Chriſt: for it is the propertie of loue to vnite thoſe that loue one another in one. Ionathans ſoule was knit with the ſoule of 
                  1 Sam. 18. 1. 
                  Dauid. For why? Ionathan loued him as his owne ſoule. He that loueth is well pleaſed with him whom he loueth, and ſeeketh alſo to pleaſe him, that they may mutually delight one in another. Were theſe three vertues well rooted in vs, we would ſay, who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, 
                  
                     Rom. 8. 35. &c.
                   
                  or diſtreſſe, &c.
            
            
               §. 88. Of the equall priuiledge of all the Saints.
               
               III. Concerning the phraſe, whereby the neereneſſe of All the Saints made one Spouſe. man and wife is ſet forth (they two ſhall be one fleſh) it may be demanded how this can be applied to Chriſt and the Saints, who are more then two?
               
                  Anſw. Chriſt by one Spirit knitteth vs all into one bodie, 1 Cor. 12. 13. and ſo maketh all ioyntly conſidered together one Spouſe. The multitude of Saints doth no more imply many wiues, then the multitude of members which the naturall bodie of a wife hath. This point then teacheth vs, that
               
                  In the myſticall mariage betwixt Chriſt and the Church, all and euerie of the Saints haue an equall priuiledge. Some are not See §. 22. Concubines, ſome wiues, nor ſome more loued, or preferred to another, but all one wife. All are one in Chriſt Ieſus. 
                  
                     Gal. 3. 28.
               
               Neither the Father that gaue them all, nor the Sonne who Reaſon. tooke them all, ſaw any thing in one more then in another; their meere grace moued them to doe what they did. Well may euerie one apply all the forenamed priuiledges vnto themselues: and not one emulate another.
               This affordeth inſtruction to the more eminent in the Vſe. Church, that like proud dames they inſult not ouer others, as if they were their hand-maids: and conſolation to the meaner ſort, that they may vphold themſelues, and poſſeſſe their ſoules with patience, and not enuie, or grieue at the outward proſperitie and priuiledges of others. In the greateſt priuiledge they are equall to the greateſt.
               
                  
This of the parties coupled to Chriſt. For theſe words (they two) ſhew that all the Saints are but one: Chriſt is the other of the two. The next words (are one fleſh) ſhew how neere thoſe Saints are to Chriſt.
            
            
               §. 89. Of the neere vnion betwixt Chriſt and the Church.
               
               The maine point here to be noted is, that
               
                  Chriſt and the Church are moſt neerely linked together. What 
                     Chriſtus nihil aliud deputat corpus ſuum (i.) Eccleſiam, quam ſeipſum, quia de Chriſto & eccleſia verius intelligitur, Erunt duo in carne una. Aug. de pec. mer. lib. 1. cap. 31. can be neerer, then that two ſhould come into one fleſh?
               
               This is ſomewhat more then to be of Chriſts fleſh. That ſhewes we are as it were cut out of Chriſt: this ſhewes that we are againe knit to him. That was a preparation vnto this: this is as the conſummation and perfection of all. See §. 70. Many metaphors are vſed to ſet forth the neere vnion betwixt Chriſt and his Church, but this ſurpaſſeth them all. As here we and Chriſt are ſaid to be one fleſh, ſo in another place, one ſpirit. Well therefore might the name and title Chriſt be giuen to this Spouſe of Chriſt.
               
                  §. 84. It was noted on a like ground to this, that of all other perſons 1 Cor. 6. 17. & 12. 12. the tranſgreſſion of a wife againſt an husband is moſt hainous. What then are the tranſgreſſions of the Church againſt Chriſt? As we are much more bound vnto Chriſt for the priuiledges we receiue from him as an Head and Husband, and ſo our Sauiour hauing made with vs an euerlaſting couenant of mariage, then for thoſe we receiued from him as our Creator, Lord and Maſter: ſo are the rebellions now committed againſt him more monſtrous. To Adam that broke the firſt couenant whereby like a rebellious childe and ſeruant he ſinned againſt his Father and Maſter, mercy and pardon was giuen: but to ſuch as now breake the bond of this euerlaſting couenant, and make a totall and finall deſertion, vtterly renouncing this Husband, or by their adulterie cauſe him to giue them a bill of diuorce, there remaineth no more ſacrifice 
                  
                     Heb. 10. 27. 
                  for ſinnes; but a certaine fearfull looking for of iudgement, and fierie indignation which ſhall deuoure the aduerſaries. This is to be noted, to make vs the more circumſpect ouer our waies, reſiſting ſinne in the beginning, and looking diligently leſt any 
                  
                     Heb. 12. 15. 
                  man fall from the grace of God; and giuing no place at all vnto 
                  
                     Eph. 4. 27. 
                  the Deuill. Satan will moſt endeuour to diſſolue the neereſt

bonds that God maketh. This then being the neereſt of all, we ought to be the moſt carefull in preſeruing it.
            
            
               §. 90. Of the myſterie of the vnion of Chriſt and the Church.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 32.
                  This is a great myſterie: but I ſpeake concerning Chriſt and the Church.
               
               THis verſe is a concluſion of that excellent digreſſion which the Apoſtle hath made concerning the neere vnion of Chriſt and the Church.
               In it two points are to be noted.
               1. A patheticall exclamation (This is a great myſterie.)
               
               2. A particular application of the forenamed law (but I ſpeake concerning Chriſt and the Church.
               
               Here firſt note that
               
                  The vnion betwixt Chriſt and the Church is a great myſterie.
               
               The Apoſtle could not haue ſaid more of it then to call it a myſterie, a great mysterie.
               
               A myſterie is a diuine ſecret. Of a myſterie ſee more in the whole armour of God, Treat. 3. §. 168. on Eph. 6. 19.
               
               A Secret it is in two reſpects.
               1. Becauſe it is not knowne.
               2. Becauſe it is vnſearchable: the depth of it cannot be fathomed.
               It is a Diuine ſecret, for two other reſpects.
               1. Becauſe it could not haue beene opened but by diuine reuelation.
               2. Becauſe when it is opened it cannot be conceiued but by the illumination of the Spirit. That Spirit which openeth and reuealeth the myſterie, muſt alſo open the eies of our vnderſtanding to diſcerne aright of it.
               It is further ſaid to be a great myſterie.
               1. Simply in it ſelfe, becauſe the matter thereof is deepe, 1. Vſe. The myſterie of our vnion with Chriſt not to be meaſured with the laſt of our reaſon. difficult, waightie, and of great moment.
               2. Comparatiuely in relation to other myſteries: no myſterie reuealed in Gods word comparable to it.
               Let vs not preſume to meaſure it with the line of our owne reaſon. It being a great myſterie, it is aboue our capacitie: yet becauſe it is reuealed we muſt beleeue it, as we doe the

myſteries of the Trinitie, of Chriſts eternall generation, of the perſonall vnion of his two natures, of the proceeding of the holy Ghoſt, with the like; becauſe the word hath reuealed them, though we cannot fully ſee the reaſon of them. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt our eſtate in this world and in the world to come: here we muſt beleeue what we know but in part: there we ſhall perfectly know whatſoeuer is to be beleeued. Preachers can but in part make knowne this myſterie, and hearers can but in part conceiue it, let vs therefore wait for perfect vnderſtanding of it, till all things be perfected in Chriſt: but in the meane time beleeue without doubting or wauering, that which is reuealed of it.
               In our meditation of this myſterie, let vs conceiue no carnall, 2. Uſe. No carnall thing in our vnion with Chriſt. Eccleſia Chriſto in occulto vxor eſt. Occultè quippe at
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         intus in abſcondito ſecreto ſpiritali anima humana inhaeret verbo Dei, vt ſint duo in carne vna. Aug. contr. Fauſt. Man. lib. 22. cap. 38. no earthly thing of it, becauſe it is a myſterie: it is altogether ſpirituall and heauenly. From the naturall vnion of our head and bodie, and from the matrimoniall vnion of man and wife, we may and ought to take occaſion by way of reſemblance, to helpe our vnderſtanding in the vnion of Chriſt and his Church: for this end are theſe reſemblances vſed, and by this meanes may our vnderſtanding be much helped, as by the outward elements and rites which are vſed in the Sacraments: but if becauſe of theſe compariſons we draw this which is only and wholly ſpirituall, to any carnall matter, we ſhall make that to be a thicke miſt, and darke cloud, which is giuen for a light.
               The dotage of our aduerſaries is here plainly diſcouered. They make our vnion with Chriſt meerely carnall. For they conceit it to conſiſt in a corporeall commixtion of Chriſts fleſh with ours, by our eating his fleſh with the teeth of our bodies, and drinking his bloud downe our throats, and digeſting both 3. Uſe. Papiſts make our vnion with Chriſt a carnall matter. Joh 6. 52. Ioh. 3. 4. in our ſtomacks as our bodily food, that ſo it may turne into our ſubſtance. Thus they ſhew themſelues like the dull-headed Capernaitans, and like ignorant Nicodemus. There is a great deale of groſſe abſurditie, but no great myſterie in that conceit.
            
            
               §. 91. Of the Popes vſurping to be Spouſe of the Church.
               
               The Apoſtles application of this myſterie to Chriſt and the Church, diſcouereth two groſſe errours of the Papiſts.
               One, that they make the Pope a Spouſe of the Church. With what face can any apply that to the Pope and the Church,

which the Apoſtle ſo expreſly ſaith is meant of Chriſt and the 
                     Multos adulteros video qui ſponſam tanto pretio emptam poſſidere volunt, & id agunt vt pro ſponſo amentur. Aug. in Ioh. Tract. 12. Uide Bern. ep. 237. ad Eugen.
                   Church? yea, what arrogant preſumption is it, to attribute that to mortall ſinfull man, which is proper to the eternall and holy Sonne of God? Is not this to conferre Chriſts prerogatiues vpon himſelfe, and ſo make himſelfe plaine Antichriſt? Who gaue the Church to the Pope, or the Pope to the Church? When did ſhe giue her conſent? (I ſpeake of the true Catholike Church of Chriſt.) What hath he done for her? or rather what hath he not done againſt her? The See §. 17. diſtinction of Imperiall and Miniſteriall Spouſe, cannot here ſerue the turne. As the metaphor of an head, ſo much leſſe the metaphor of a Spouſe will admit a miniſteriall Spouſe. As he is an adulterer that taketh vpon him to be a miniſteriall husband, ſo is ſhe an adultereſſe that yeeldeth her ſelfe to ſuch an one. The Apoſtle ſaith, I haue eſpouſed you to ONE husband. 
                  2 Cor. 11 2.
               
            
            
               §. 92. Of the falſe Sacrament of Mariage.
               
               The other error is, that Mariage is a Sacrament: the maine ground whereof they haue taken from this text, which ground by the Apoſtles application of this myſterie to Chriſt and the Church, is as plainly remoued, as if the Apoſtle had purpoſely ordered his ſtile, to preuent this erroneous collection: as if he had ſaid, That none may miſtake this myſterie, and apply it to a matrimoniall coniunction of man and woman together, know that I meane no ſuch thing: the myſterie which I ſpeake of, is concerning Chriſt and the Church. I maruell how they dare miſapply that which is ſo plainly expreſſed. Though the Apoſtle had not ſo clearely ſhewed his minde and meaning, yet the verie thing it ſelfe would lead vs ſo to iudge of it. For, that which in Chriſt

                  and the Church is a great myſterie, in man and wife is but a ſmall matter. The vulgar Latine tranſlation firſt led them into this error, for it tranſlateth the word myſterie, a Sacrament. But a tranſlation is no ſufficient ground to proue a doctrine. Beſides the word Sacrament vſed by that Tranſlator, hath as large an extent as a myſterie: if they ſhould make euerie thing which he tranſlateth Sacrament, a proper Sacrament of the Church, there would be many more Sacraments then the Papiſts themſelues doe make.
               1. As for this ſuppoſed Sacrament, no Papiſt could euer

ſhew when or where God ordained it to be a Sacrament. Nay, they agree not among themſelues about the time, how long it hath beene a Sacrament. 
                     Alphonſ. à Caſtro contr. haer. lib. 3. Some of them hold, that euer ſince the firſt inſtitution of mariage in Paradiſe, it hath beene a Sacrament. But the greater number of Papiſts hold it to be a Sacrament 
                     Petrus à Soto de Matr. lect. 2. Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 24. Can. 1. of the new Teſtament vnder the Goſpell, becauſe their Tridentine Councell hath ſo decreed it. Where we may note how the greater number of them, when two abſurdities are queſtioned, are readie to fall into the worſt. Vnder the Law the nonage of the Church needed, and had more Sacraments then vnder the Goſpell: yet that which was in vſe as much vnder the Law as vnder the Goſpell, and had then as much to make it a Sacrament as now, was then none, yet now is one.
               2. As they cannot ſhew where it was ordained for a Sacrament, ſo neither can they ſhew what is the Sacramentall ſigne thereof. Some make carnall copulation to be it. But there may be a true mariage, though the parties maried neuer know each other.
               Others make the Parents giuing to be the ſigne. But they hold that that is a true mariage, which is done without parents conſent.
               Others the Prieſts bleſſing. Yet they hold the mariage of Infidels and Heretiques who haue no Prieſts, to be a true mariage.
               Others, the conſent of the parties themſelues. Thus ſhall a partie adminiſter a Sacrament to himſelfe.
               Others, other things. Thus they wanting the light of Gods word, one ſtrayeth in one by-path, another in another, and none of them hit vpon the right.
               3. A like difference there is about the forme of this Sacrament.
               4. If other poſitions deliuered by them concerning matrimonie be noted, a man would thinke that they ſhould be farre from making it a Sacrament. They preferre virginitie before it. Yea, they account it a kinde of pollution. They hold it vnlawfull for Prieſts, Monks, Nuns, and ſuch like holy orders (as they eſteeme them) to marie: ſo as there is a Sacrament, whereof their holy ones may not partake. The order of

Prieſthood is a Sacrament (in their account) yet that order keepeth from mariage, ſo as one Sacrament fighteth againſt another. Yea, Infidels may be partakers of a Sacrament, and ſo their holy and precious things ſhall be denied to their holy ones, and caſt vnto ſwine. Thus we ſee a rotten building erected vpon a ſandie foundation: a falſe Sacrament eſtabliſhed vpon a falſe application of this text. Can it then ſtand?
            
            
               §. 93. Of the Summe of husbands and wiues duties.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 33.
                  Neuertheleſſe, let euerie one of you in particular ſo loue his wife, euen as himſelfe: and the wife ſee that ſhe reuerence her husband.
               
               THe Apoſtle hauing made a large digreſsion about the mutuall relation betwixt Chriſt and the Church, whom he propounded as patternes to husbands and wiues, he now returneth to the maine point intended, namely to the duties of husbands and wiues: and ſo much doth the firſt particle imply (Neuertheleſſe) as if he had thus ſaid, Though I haue a little digreſſed 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  into the myſterie of the vnion of Chriſt and the Church, yet neuertheleſſe doe ye, ô husbands and wiues, call to minde that which I principally aimed at, euen your duties.
               
               This verſe then containeth a concluſion of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, concerning the duties of husbands and wiues.
               Two points are eſpecially noted therein.

                     1. A declaration of their ſeuerall and diſtinct duties.
                     2. A direction to apply their owne proper duties each of them to themſelues.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        Their diſtinct duties are noted in two words,
                        Loue.
                     
                     
                        Feare.
                         
                     
                  
               
               Theſe two, as they are diſtinct duties in themſelues, ſo are they alſo common conditions which muſt be annexed to all other duties. Loue as ſugar to ſweeten the duties of authoritie, which appertaine to an husband. Feare as ſalt to ſeaſon all the duties of ſubiection which appertaine to a wife. The Apoſtle therefore hath ſet them downe as two marks for husbands and wiues to aime at in euerie thing wherein they haue to deale one with the other.
               
                  
Of theſe I will more diſtinctly ſpeake in the treatiſes of the particular duties of husbands and wiues.
            
            
               §. 94. Of applying the word to our ſelues.
               
               The direction for a particular application of their owne proper duties to either of them is here eſpecially to be noted. In this direction two things are to be obſerued.
               1. That euery particular perſon apply to himſelfe that which by a Miniſter is indefinitly deliuered to all. Euery one 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  of you in particular, ſaith the Apoſtle: which is as much as if he had thus more largely expreſſed his minde, I haue laid downe ſuch generall duties as all husbands and wiues without exception of any of what ranke or degree ſoeuer they be are bound vnto; which though by name I haue not ſeuerally deliuered to euerie one, one by one, but generally to you all, yet doe euerie one of you apply thoſe things to your ſelues in particular.
               
               2. That euery one apply his owne peculiar dutie vnto himſelfe. Loue being peculiar to an husband, to him he ſaith, Let him loue his wife: and reuerence being peculiar to a wife, to her he ſaith, let the wife ſee that ſhe reuerence her huſband.
               
               The direction in euery of thoſe ſeuerall Epiſtles which were ſent to the ſeuen Churches of Aſia, (in theſe words, He that 
                  
                     Reu. 2. 7. 
                  hath an eare, let him heare what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches) doth teach euerie member in any of thoſe Churches to apply to himſelfe that which was deliuered to the whole Church: ſo doth a like 
                     Luk. 8. 8. exhortation which Chriſt with an exclamation made to the people whom he taught in parables: and this declaration of the extent of Chriſts counſell, what I ſay to 
                  
                     Mar. 13. 37. 
                  you, I ſay to all. To this purpoſe many precepts giuen to whole Churches, and to all ſorts of people are ſet downe in the ſingular number as giuen to one, as, Awake THOV that 
                  
                     Eph. 5. 14. 
                  ſleepeſt. THOV ſtandeſt by faith: be not thou high minded &c. 
                  
                     Rom. 11. 20.
               
               The life and power of Gods word conſiſteth in this particular 
                     Reaſon. The life of Gods word in application. application thereof vnto our ſelues. This is to mixe faith with hearing: faith, I ſay, whereby we doe not only beleeue the truth of Gods word in generall, but alſo beleeue it to be a truth concerning our ſelues in particular: and thus will euery precept thereof be a good inſtruction and direction

on to vs to guide vs in the way of righteouſneſſe: euery promiſe therein will be a great incouragement, and conſolation to vs to vphold vs, and to make vs hold on: and euery iudgement threatned therein will be a curbe, and bridle to hold vs in, and to keepe vs from thoſe ſinnes againſt which the iudgements are threatned. But otherwiſe, if we bring not the word home to our own ſoules, it will be as a word ſpoken into the aire, 
                  1 Cor. 14 9. vaniſhing away without any profit to vs. Nothing maketh the word leſſe profitable, then the putting of it off from our ſelues to others, thinking that it concernes others more then our ſelues.
               That we may make the better vſe of this doctrine, let vs obſerue both what are generall duties belonging to all Chriſtians, and apply them as particular to our ſelues: and alſo what duties appertaine to ſuch perſons as are of our place, calling, and condition, and more eſpecially apply them to our ſelues: let all manner of husbands, and all manner of wiues of what ranke or degree ſoeuer they be that ſhall read the duties hereafter following, know that they are ſpoken to them in particular. Let Kings and Queenes, Lords and Ladies, Miniſters and their wiues, Rich men and their wiues, Poore men and their wiues, Old men and their wiues, Young men and their wiues, all of all ſorts take them as ſpoken to them in particular. It is not honour, wealth, learning, or any other excellency, nor meanes of place, pouerty, want of learning, or any other like thing that can exempt an husband from louing his wife, or a wife from reuerencing her husband. He that ſaith euery one, excepteth not any one. Therefore euery one in particular doe yee ſo. The like application may be made to all Parents and children, Maſters and ſeruants, concerning their duties.
            
            
               §. 95. Of euery ones looking to his owne dutie eſpecially.
               
               In the forenamed application an eye muſt be had rather to the dutie which we owe, and ought to be performed by vs to others, then to that which is due to vs, and others ought to performe to vs: for the Apoſtle ſaith not to the husband, ſee that thy wife reuerence thee, but ſee that thou loue her: ſo to the wife.
               
                  
For this purpoſe the holy Ghoſt preſſeth particular duties vpon thoſe particular perſons who ought to performe them: as Subiection on wiues: loue on husbands: and ſo in others. This therefore is eſpecially to be conſidered of thee, how thou 
                     Vnum duntaxat tibi conſiderandum eſt, quo pacto te praeſtes innoxium. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. maiſt ſhew thy ſelfe blameleſſe. I denie not but that one ought to prouoke another, and one to helpe another in what they can to performe their dutie, eſpecially ſuperiours who haue charge ouer others, but the moſt principall care of euery one ought to be for himſelfe, and greateſt conſcience to be made of performing his owne duty.
               1. It is more acceptable before God, and more commendable Reaſons. before men to doe duty, then to exact duty. As in matters of free charity, ſo alſo of bounden duty, It is more bleſſed to 
                  
                     Act. 20. 35. 
                  giue, then to receiue. In particular it is better for an husband to be a good husband, then to haue a good wife: ſo for a wife. To haue others faile in duty to vs may be an heauy croſſe, for vs to faile in our dutie to others is a fearefull curſe.
               2. Euery one is to giue an account of his owne particular 
                     Rom. 14. 12. duty. That which the Prophet ſpeaketh of father and ſonne, may be applied to husband and wife, and to all other ſorts of people, If a father doe that which is lawfull and right, he is iuſt, he 
                  
                     Ezec. 18. 5. &c.
                   
                  ſhall ſurely liue: if he beget a ſonne that doth not ſo, he ſhall ſurely die, his bloud ſhall be vpon him. Againe, if a father doe that which is not good, he ſhall die in his iniquity: but if his ſonne doe that which is lawfull and right he ſhall ſurely liue. The righteouſneſſe of the righteous ſhall be vpon himſelfe: and the wickedneſſe of the wicked ſhall be vpon himſelfe. That this ſhall be ſo betwixt huſband and wife, may be gathered out of theſe words, Two ſhall 
                  
                     Luk. 17. 34. 
                  be in one bed, the one ſhall be taken, the other left.
               
               Let this be noted againſt the common vaine apologies which are made for neglect of duty, which is this, Dutie is not performed to me, why ſhall I doe dutie? when my husband doth his dutie, I will doe mine, ſaith the wife. And I mine, ſaith the husband, when my wife doth hers. What if he neuer doe his dutie, and ſo be damned, wilt thou neuer doe thine? This looking for of dutie at others hands, makes vs the more careleſſe of our owne.
               Doe you therefore O husbands looke eſpecially to your Vſe.
                  
owne duties, doe you loue your wiues: and you ô wiues looke Non quae alijs data ſunt praecepta quaerimus quando alicuius criminis ac. cuſamur. Chryſ. loc. citat. you to yours eſpecially, doe you reuerence your husbands. For this end, let husbands read thoſe duties moſt diligently which concerne husbands, and wiues thoſe, which concerne wiues. Let not the husband ſay of the wiues duties, there are goodleſſons for my wife, and neglect his owne: nor the wife ſay the like of husbands duties, and not regard her owne. This is it that maketh the ſubiection of many wiues very harſh and irkeſome to them, becauſe their husbands that vrge and preſſe them thereto ſhew little, or no loue to them at all: and this is it that maketh many husbands very backwards in ſhewing loue, becauſe their wiues which expect much loue, ſhew little or no reuerence to their husbands. Wherefore Let euery one of you in particular ſo loue his wife, euen as himſelfe: and the wife ſee that ſhe reuerence her husband.
               
            
            
               §. 96. Of the meaning of the firſt verſe of the ſixt Chapter.
               
               FRom thoſe particular duties which concerne husbands and wiues the Apoſtle proceedeth to lay down ſuch as concerne children and parents. As before he laid downe wiues duties before husbands, ſo here he beginneth with childrens (who are inferiour to their parents) and that for the ſame reaſons which were rendred §. 10. before.
               Beſides children are the fruits of matrimoniall coniunction, therefore fitly placed next vnto Man and Wife.
               
               That which concerneth children is laid downe in the ſixt Chapter of Eph. verſ. 1, 2, 3. The meaning whereof we will diſtinctly open.
               EPHES. 6. 1. Children obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
               The firſt word (children) is in the originall as proper a word 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . at could be vſed, for according to the notation of it, it ſignifieth ſuch as are begotten and borne. Anſwerable is the other word (parents) which ſignifieth ſuch as beget and bring forth 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Who are to be accounted children, who parents. children. Yet are they not ſo ſtrictly to be taken as if none but ſuch as begat and brought forth, or ſuch as are begotten and brought forth of them were meant: for vnder the title parents,
                  
he includeth all ſuch as are in the place of naturall parents, as Grandfathers and Grandmothers, Fathers in law, and Mothers in law, Foſter-fathers and Foſter-mothers, Guardians, Tutors, and ſuch like gouernors: and vnder the title children he compriſeth Grand-children, Sonnes and daughters in law, Wards, Pupils, and ſuch like. For there is an honour and a ſubiection due by all who are in place of children, to all ſuch as are in place of parents, though in a different kinde, as we ſhall 
                     Treat. 5. §. 56, 57, &c. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . after ſhew. This word children which in the originall is of the neuter gender, doth further include both ſexes, males and females, ſonnes and daughters: ſo as either of them are as carefully to apply the duties here ſet forth to themſelues as if in particular both kindes had beene expreſſed.
               He expreſſeth parents in the plurall number, to ſhew that he 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . meaneth here alſo both ſexes father and mother, as the law expreſſeth both: and addeth this relatiue particle your, as by way 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . of reſtraint, to ſhew that euery child is not bound to euery parent, ſo by way of extent to ſhew that whatſoeuer the eſtate of parents be honourable or meane, rich or poore, learned or vnlearned, &c. their owne children muſt not be aſhamed of them, but yeeld all bounden dutie to them: if they be parents to children, they muſt be honoured by children.
               The word (Obey) vnder which all duties of children are 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . compriſed, according to the Greeke notation, ſignifieth with an humble ſubmiſſion to hearken, that is, to attend and giue heed to the commandements, reproofes, directions, and exhortations which are giuen to them, and that with ſuch a reuerend reſpect of the parties who deliuer them, as they make themſelues conformable thereto.
               A dutie proper to inferiours, and implieth both reuerence and obedience: the 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . verbe noteth out Obedience; the 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . prepoſition, Reuerence.
               
               Vnder this word (Obey) the Apoſtle comprehendeth all All duties of children compriſed vnder obedience.
                   thoſe duties which thorowout the Scripture are required of children: as is manifeſt by his owne exemplification thereof in the ſecond verſe by the word honour which the law vſeth: ſo as this word (obey) is to be taken in as large an extent as that word (honour.)
               
               
                  
                  
                     Queſt. Why is obedience put for all the reſt?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. Becauſe it is the hardeſt of all the reſt, and that which children are loatheſt to performe they who willingly yeeld to this, will ſticke at no duty.
                  2. Becauſe it is the ſureſt euidence of that honour which a childe oweth to his parent: and ſo of performing the fift commandement.
                  3. Becauſe children are bound to their parents: the duties which they performe are not of curteſie, but neceſſity. Their parents haue power to command, and exact them.
                  The clauſe added (in the Lord) is in effect the ſame which 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . was vſed 
                        Chap. 5. verſ. 22. before (as vnto the Lord) and it noteth forth a limitation, direction, and inſtigation: a limitation ſhewing that childrens obedience to their parents is to be reſtrained to the obedience which they owe to Chriſt, and may not goe beyond the limits thereof: a direction ſhewing that in obeying their parents, they muſt haue an eye to Chriſt, and ſo obey them as Chriſt may approue thereof: an inſtigation ſhewing that parents beare the image of Chriſt, and in that reſpect children muſt the rather obey their parents.
                  The laſt clauſe of this verſe (for this is right) is an expreſſe 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . reaſon to inforce the forenamed point of obedience: and it is drawne from equity: and ſheweth that it is a point agreeable to all law: yea that in way of recompence it is due: and if children be not obedient to parents they doe that which is moſt vniuſt, they defraud their parents of their right.
                  The former phraſe (in the Lord) implying one reaſon, this plainly noteth out another, as the firſt particle (for) declareth.

                  Honour thy father and mother (which is the firſt commandement with promiſe.)
               
               THe very words of the fift commandement are here alleaged Why the morall law is alleaged. by the Apoſtle as a confirmation of the forenamed reaſon, that, it is iuſt and right to obey parents, becauſe God in the morall law enioyneth as much. The law is more generall then

the Apoſtles precept: for the law compriſeth vnder it all thoſe duties which all kinde of inferiours owe to their ſuperiours, whether they be in family, church, or common wealth: but the Apoſtles precept is giuen only to one kinde of inferiours in the family: yet the argument is very ſound and good from a generall to a particular, thus, All inferiours muſt 
                  A genere ad ſpeciem. 
                  honour their ſuperiours, therefore children their parents.
               
               By adding the expreſſe words of the law the Apoſtle ſheweth that the ſubiection which he required of children is no yoke which he of his owne head put on their neckes: but that which the morall law hath put on them: ſo as this may be noted as a third reaſon, namely Gods expreſſe charge in his morall law.
               If I ſhould handle this law according to the full extent thereof, I ſhould wander too farre from the Apoſtles ſcope. I will therefore open it no further then it may concerne the point in hand, viz. the duty of children.
               
                  Honour compriſeth here all thoſe duties which children in Honour compriſeth all childrens duties. any reſpect owe to their parents. It implieth both an inward reuerend eſtimation, and alſo an outward dutifull ſubmiſſion. Yea it implieth alſo recompence, and maintenance.
               
               
                  Honour in relation to parents, is vſed for two reaſons eſpecially.
               1. To ſhew that parents beare Gods image: for honour is properly due to God alone: to the creature it is due, only as it ſtandeth in Gods roome, and carieth his image.
               2. To ſhew, that it is an honour to parents to haue dutifull children: euen as it is a diſhonour to them to haue diſobedient children.
               Both father and mother are expreſly mentioned, to take away Why both father and mother expreſſed. all pretence from children of neglecting either of them: for through the corruption of nature we are prone to ſeeke after many ſhifts to exempt vs from our bounden dutie; and if not in whole, yet in as great a part as we can. Some might thinke if they honour their father, who is their mothers head, they haue done what the law requireth: others may thinke they haue done as much, if they honour their mother who is the weaker veſſell: but the law expreſſing father and mother,
                  
condemneth him that neglecteth either of them. Yet to ſhew that if oppoſition ſhould ariſe betwixt them, and by reaſon thereof both could not be obeyed together, the father commanding what the mother forbiddeth, the father is to be preferred, (eſpecially if it be not againſt the Lord) the father is ſet in the firſt place.
               Theſe words following (which is the firſt commandement 
                  How the fift commandement is the firſt with promiſe. 
                  with promiſe) are fitly included in a parentheſis, becauſe they are not the words of the law, but inſerted by the Apoſtle as a reaſon to inforce the law, and ſo make a fourth reaſon.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. In what reſpect is this commandement called the firſt with promiſe?
                  
                  
                     Anſw. 1. The * word here vſed by the Apoſtle properly 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . ſignifieth an affirmatiue precept, as our Engliſh word (commandement) doth. Now then of the affirmatiue precepts it is the firſt with promiſe.
                  
                  2. The Scripture oft appropriateth the law to the ſecond table, as where he ſaith he that loueth another hath fulfilled the 
                     
                        Rom. 13 8. 
                     law, and ſo in other places.
                  Now this is the firſt commandement of the ſecond table.
                  3. It is generally true of all the commandements: for among the ten it is the firſt with promiſe.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. The ſecond commandement hath a promiſe annexed Difference betwixt the promiſe in the ſecond, and fiſt commandement. to it.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. That which is annexed to the ſecond Commandement, is not expreſly a promiſe, but rather a declaration of Gods Iuſtice, in taking vengeance of tranſgreſſors, and of his mercie in rewarding obſeruers of the Law: yet I denie not but that a promiſe by conſequence is implied: but here it is expreſſed.
                  2. The promiſe there implied is only a generall promiſe made to obſeruers of the whole Law, and therefore he vſeth the plurall number, Commandements: but here is a particular promiſe made to them that keepe this Commandement in particular.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. Why is it then ſaid the firſt, when no other Commandements with promiſe follow? 
                        Firſt ſimply taken.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. This particle (firſt) hath not alwayes reference to

ſome other following, but is oft ſimply taken, to ſhew that none was before it: ſo is the word firſt-borne vſed in the Law: 
                        Exod. 13. 2. Matth. 1. 25. and ſo Chriſt is called the firſt-borne Sonne of Marie.
                  
                  The word promiſe ſheweth, that this fourth reaſon includeth ſome benefit redounding to thoſe children themſelues that honour their parents: the benefit is expreſly mentioned in the next verſe, which we will afterwards diſtinctly conſider.
               
            
            
               §. 98. Of aiming at our owne, in ſeeking the good of others.
               
               Here in generall we may note, that
               
                  It is not vnlawfull to aime at our owne good and benefit in doing the duties which God requireth at our hands to others: for that which God himſelfe propoundeth and ſetteth before vs, we may ſeeke and aime at. Many like promiſes there be in Scripture, and many approued prayers grounded on thoſe promiſes whereby the truth of the doctrine is confirmed vnto vs. Hezekiah 
                  
                     Iſa. 38. 2, 3. maketh the good ſeruice he had done to God and his Church, a ground to obtaine longer life: ſo others.
               For God layeth no dutie on any man, but therein he aimeth at the good of him who performeth the dutie as well as of him to whom the dutie is performed. Whereby he would ſhew that his Commandements are no ſtrait yokes and heauie burthens, but meanes of procuring their good who fulfill them.
               How highly doth this commend the good reſpect that 1. Vſe.
                   God beareth to all the ſonnes of men: ſeeking their good in euerie place wherein he ſetteth them, either of authoritie, or ſubiection?
               How ought this to ſtirre vs vp willingly and cheerefully to 2. Vſe.
                   obſerue the Lawes which God commandeth vs, and performe the ſeruices he requireth of vs, ſeeing thereby we procure our owne good?
               How fully may this ſatisfie, and euen ſtop the mouthes of 3. Vſe.
                   all ſuch as are diſcontent with their places, and mutter againſt that ſubiection which God enioyneth to them?
               What a good direction and reſolution may this be to many, 4. Vſe.
                   who being moued in conſcience to ſeeke the good of others, doubt whether therein they may aime at their owne good or no? To make this caſe cleare by an inſtance, which may ſerue in ſtead of many. A Miniſter faithfull in his place, and verie

painfull, and in that reſpect of a good conſcience, but withall of a tender and weake conſcience, doubteth whether thereby he may ſeeke maintenance to himſelfe, fearing that ſo he ſeeketh himſelfe, and not ſimply the edification of Gods Church. But by the forenamed doctrine we ſee that both may be aimed at: for God commandeth the one, and promiſeth the other. As we haue one eye on Gods Commandement for direction, ſo we may haue another on his promiſe for incouragement.
               Yet becauſe through the corruption of our nature, we are too Cautions in ſeeking our owne good. prone to ſeeke our ſelues, ſome cautions are in this point carefully to be obſerued.
               1. That we ſeeke not our owne good by any tranſgreſſion, for it is promiſed vnto obedience.
               
               2. That we doe not ſo wholly ſeeke our ſelues and our owne good, as we neglect others: for God hauing ioyned both together, no man may put them aſunder.
               3. That we aime at our owne good, as a reward following vpon the dutie which God commandeth, and ſo be as willing to doe the dutie, as deſirous of the reward.
               4. That our owne benefit be not the only, no nor the chiefeſt thing we aime at in doing our dutie, but rather come as a motiue to adde an edge, and to ſharpen other motiues of greater moment. And thus much the order which the Apoſtle obſerueth in ſetting downe his reaſons, noteth vnto vs: for the three former haue reſpect to God, and to that good conſcience which children ought to carrie towards him: the firſt pointeth at Gods image which parents carie (in the Lord:) the ſecond ſetteth forth that right which God hath preſcribed to children: the third declareth Gods charge: this fourth only, which is the laſt, hath reſpect to the profit and benefit of children themſelues.
            
            
               §. 99. Of preferring honeſtie before commoditie.
               
               From the forenamed order we may further gather, that Equitie and good conſcience ought more to moue vs to doe our dutie then our owne profit, and the benefit that thereby redoundeth to vs. If there ſhould come ſuch an oppoſition betwixt theſe that they could not both ſtand togethet, but that for doing that which is right, and which God hath commanded, our

proſperitie muſt be hindred and life ſhortned, we ſhould ſo ſtand to that which is right and commanded of God, as proſperitie, life and all be let goe. To this purpoſe tend all the exhortations in Scripture, to forſake goods, lands, life, and euerie thing elſe for righteouſneſſe ſake. So cleare is this point, 
                     Cic. lib. 2. de Offic. & Paradox. 1. that the Heathen diſcerned it by the glimpſe of that light of nature which they had: for they could ſay, that that which is honeſt and right, is to be preferred before that which is commodious and profitable.
               There is no compariſon betwixt honeſtie and commoditie, right and profit. The one is abſolutely neceſſarie for attaining to eternall ſaluation, the other giueth but a little quiet and contentment in this world: nay, if profit be without right, it can giue no true contentment or quiet at all.
               Vnworthie therefore they are of the name of Chriſtians, who Vſe. ſo wholly and only aime at their outward profit and proſperitie, as they regard not what is right, and what God hath commanded. If by obeying God, and doing that which is right they may reape ſome benefit to themſelues they can be content 
                     Nihil bonum Scriptura niſi quod honeſtum aſſerit. Ambr. Offic. lib. 2. cap. 3. to yeeld thereunto: but if not, farewell all right, farewell all Gods commandements. Though they thinke euery thing that is profitable, be it right or wrong, to be good, yet Gods word accounteth nothing good but that which is honeſt: ſuch therefore can looke for no bleſſing from the Lord.
            
            
               §. 100. Of the meaning of the third verſe.
               
               
                  EPHES. 6. 3.
                  
                     
                        That it may be well with thee, and thou maiſt liue long on the earth.
                     
                  
               
               THe promiſe mentioned before in generall, is here particularly ſet downe. The firſt words (that it may be well with thee) are not in the Hebrew text 
                     Exod. 20. 12. there where the Law is firſt recorded, and thereupon not ſet in that vſuall forme of the ten Commandements, which is in vſe among vs: but yet in 
                     Deut. 5. 16. another place where the Law is repeated, they are ſet downe: and the Greeke tranſlation, commonly called the Septuagint (which (as is probable) the Church in the Apoſtles time vſed) hath expreſly noted it in both places. Now this part of the promiſe

                  (that it may be well with thee) is prefixed as an amplification of the other part concerning long life, which is the moſt principall thing intended, as appeareth in that it only is mentioned where the Law is firſt recorded. It ſheweth that the long life 
                  Longlife and proſperitie ioyned together. which God promiſeth, ſhall not be a life of woe and miſerie, (for then were it no bleſsing, but the longer life laſted, the worſe it would be) but a life full of comfort and happineſſe: therefore Moſes fetteth this former clauſe in the latter place after long life thus (that thy dayes may be prolonged, and that it 
                  
                     Deut. 5. 16. 
                  may goe well with thee) to ſhew that the well being here ſpoken of, is an amplification of the benefit of long life.
               
               Whereas the Apoſtle ſetteth downe the place where the benefit of this promiſe is to be enioyed in a moſt large phraſe, thus (on earth) the Law bringeth it to a more narrow compaſſe thus (in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee) meaning the land of Canaan which was giuen of God as a peculiar inheritance to the Iewes: ſo that the promiſe (as the Law ſetteth it downe in peculiar to the Iewes) implieth long life, and proſperitie in their owne inheritance: for long life to the Iewes was counted no life out of their owne Countrey. But the Apoſtle writing to all nations, leaueth out that deſcription of Canaan, and retaineth only the generall ſubſtance in this word (on earth) which he ſetteth downe to ſhew that euen outward proſperitie, and a long life in this world is here promiſed.
            
            
               §. 101. Of proſperitie: how farre forth it may be a bleſſing.
               
               For further clearing of this text, and for better application thereof, I will reſolue ſundrie queſtions ariſing out of it, and gather ſuch profitable inſtructions as it affordeth.
               The promiſe conſiſteth of two branches.
               The firſt branch (that it may be well with thee) is very ample 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . and large: all good things, all manner of bleſſings whatſoeuer, ſpirituall and temporall, belonging to ſoule and body, concerning this life, and the life to come, make to a mans wellbeing. Whence may firſt be demanded;
               
                  1. Quſt. What may be the extent of this phraſe in this place? Temporall proſperitie promiſed. 1 Tim. 4. 8.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. It may generally be extended to all manner of good things. For Godlineſſe hath promiſe of the life that now is and of
                     
                     that that is to come. But (as I take it) temporall proſperitie is here principally intended: and that for theſe reaſons.
                  1. It is ioyned with long life, which is a temporall bleſsing.
                  2. The laſt word (on earth) may be referred to this branch of well-being, as well as to the other of long life.
                  
                  3. In the Law (from whence this clauſe is taken) it is expreſly ſet downe, thus, that it may goe well with thee in the 
                     
                        Deut. 5. 16. 
                     land, &c.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. Is then outward temporall proſperitie (as honour, Proſperitie a good thing. health, peace, libertie, goods, &c.) a token of Gods loue and fauour?
                  
                     Anſw. Yea: in it ſelfe it is a bleſsing, and fruit of Gods loue: as appeareth by theſe reaſons.
                  1. As at firſt it was made and ordained of God, it is a good thing.
                  2. It tendeth to mans good, if it be rightly vſed.
                  3. It was beſtowed on man before he had offended.
                  4. It is promiſed of God as a reward to them that feare him 
                        Leuit. 26. 4. &c. Deut. 28. 1. &c.
                      and keepe his Commandements.
                  5. The Saints haue prayed for it, and haue beene thankfull 
                        Gen. 28. 20. & 32. 10, 11. for it.
                  6. The contrarie was firſt inflicted as a puniſhment of ſinne, 
                        Leuit. 26. 15. &c.
                      and is oft threatned as a token of Gods wrath, and ſo hath alſo beene inflicted on tranſgreſſors. 
                        Deut. 28. 16. &c.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               §. 102. Of proſperitie beſtowed on the wicked, how it proues a curſe.
               
               
                  3. Queſt. Why then is it beſtowed vpon the wicked, euen ſuch as are 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . haters of God, and are hated of him? And why are Gods friends, ſuch as are 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . loued of him, and loue him againe, depriued thereof? This ſore ſcruple made Dauid ſtumble, 
                        Pſal. 73. 13. Ier. 12. 1. Hab. 1. 3. and moued other Prophets to complaine. But the anſwer is readie.
                  
                     Anſw. Outward proſperitie is of that nature, as it may turne to the good or hurt of him that enioyeth it. And herein is Gods admirable and vnſearchable wiſdome ſeene, in that he is able to turne bleſſings into curſes, and curſes into bleſſings. How proſperitie proues a curſe to the wicked. He can worke by contraries.
               
               
                  4. Queſt. How is proſperitie a curſe to the wicked?
                  
                     
                     Anſw. By meere conſequence, through their abuſe of it. God giues it to them to ſhew the riches of his mercie: and that all may taſte thereof, he doth good to the euill and the good. Beſides, 
                        Matth. 5. 45. Rom. 2. 4. he thus trieth if by any meanes they may be brought to repentance: which gift becauſe they haue not, their proſperitie proueth to be a meanes to make them the more inexcuſable, and the more to increaſe their iuſt condemnation. For the more Gods bleſsings abound towards them, the more they abuſe them, adding to all their other ſinnes, that moſt odious ſinne of ingratitude, which maketh vp the heape of all. And in theſe reſpects I may ſay of the proſperitie of the wicked, as the Prophet of their King, God giues it in his anger, and takes it away in 
                     
                        Oſe. 13. 11. 
                     his wrath. For by their abuſe thereof, it proueth Satans bait to allure them, his ſnare to catch them, and his hooke to drowne 1 Tim. 6. 9. them in perdition and deſtruction. In a word therefore, the wicked are fed in a faire paſture like oxen appointed to the ſlaughter: they are exalted on high, as on a ladder or ſcaffold, like theeues and traytors, to be brought downe with ſhame and deſtruction, as Pharaohs Baker was lift vp.

               §. 103. How both hauing, and wanting proſperitie is a bleſſing to the Saints.
               
               
                  5. Queſt. How is the inioying, or wanting of proſperitie a bleſſing to the righteous?
                  
                     Anſw. God in wiſdome knowing what is beſt for them accordingly deales with them, he beſtoweth proſperitie on them ſo farre as he ſeeth it will turne vnto their good: and denieth it to them ſo farre as he ſeeth it will turne to their hurt. Whenſoeuer therefore God beſtoweth any temporall bleſſing on his Saints, it is a token of his favour: and whenſoeuer he denieth any, the very deniall is alſo a fruit of his fauour. Herein is it verified that All things worke together for good to them 
                     
                        Rom. 8. 28. 
                     that loue God, ſo as, if they abound, it ſhall goe well with them: if they want, it ſhall goe well with them: if they be in high place, it ſhall goe well with them: if in meane place, it ſhall got well with them: if they be at libertie, if in priſon: if they be in health, if ſicke: in what eſtate ſoeuer, it ſhall goe well with them.
               
               
                  6. Queſt. How is it then that Saints are oft brought to ſuch

extermities that they are forced to complaine that it is very Complaints of Saints impeach not their well being. ill with them?
                  
                     Anſw. There is fleſh and bloud in them, by reaſon of the weakneſſe whereof they are forced to complaine: but the preſent apprehenſion of weake fleſh, is not ſufficient to impeach the truth of Gods promiſe: they conſider not in their preſent extremitie what is Gods minde, what his manner of dealing with them, how needfull it is that ſo they ſhould be dealt withall, what end and iſſue the Lord will giue: in truth it is better with them then they wot of. Some weightie reaſons there be which moue God to bring them to that extremitie wherein they are, and thoſe reſpecting his

               §. 104. Of long-life: how farre forth it is a bleſſing.
               
               Concerning the ſecond branch of Gods promiſe (long-life) other queſtions are to be reſolued.
               
                  1. Queſt. Is long-life a bleſſing? Long life a bleſſing.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. Yea, elſe would not God here and in other places haue promiſed it as a reward, nor haue beſtowed it on his Saints.
                  The reaſons to proue it to be a bleſſing may be drawne to three heads. 1. Gods glorie. 2. the good of the Church where they liue. 3. their owne good.
                  
                  1. Gods glorie is much aduanced by the long life of the Saints: for the longer they liue the more they doe themſelues obſerue Gods wonderfull workes, and the more they doe make them knowne and declare them to others. But in the graue all 
                        Pſal. 6. 5. Iſa. 38. 18. is forgotten.
                  2. Gods Church is greatly edified thereby: in which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith, to abide in the fleſh is more needfull for 
                     
                        Phil. 1. 24. 
                     you: In the Saints that is true which Elihu ſaith ſhould be, namely that daies ſpeake, and multitude of yeeres teach wiſdome. 
                     
                        Iob. 32. 7. The longer the Saints liue, the more good they doe: but after death they doe none: when the night commeth no man can worke: 
                     
                        Iob. 9. 4.
                     
                     
                        Gal. 6. 10. vpon which ground the Apoſtle exhorteth to doe good while we haue time.
                  
                  3. The Saints by long liuing purchaſe to themſelues great honour, and dignitie among Gods people, and a ſtrong ſtedfaſt confidence in God. Men regard a good old ſeruant: much more will God. Two ſtrong props haue old Saints to eſtabliſh them, and make them bold: one is a remembrance of Gods former fauours, whereby their hope of eternall life is made more ſure vnto them: another is a kinde of preſent expectation of the accompliſhment of Gods promiſes which they haue long waited for.
                  By this it appeares that this particular promiſe is no light matter, of ſmall moment: but a ſtrong motiue to ſtirre vp children to obedience.
               
            
            
               §. 105. Of long life prouing a curſe to the wicked.
               
               
                  2. Queſt.
                  
                  Why then is long life giuen to many wicked ones? and why are many Saints cut off?
                  Anſw. Long life is of the ſame kinde that proſperitie is: it may be turned to a curſe, as well as proue a bleſſing.
                  The wicked by liuing long on earth make their ſins grow to the full (as is implied of the Amorite) they make their 
                        Gen. 15. 16. name to ſtinke the more on earth, as a carion the longer it remaineth aboue ground the more it ſtinketh: and they cauſe the greater torment in hell to be inflicted vpon them: for as 
                        Rom. 2. 5. ſinne is increaſed, ſo ſhall that torment be increaſed.
                  The righteous haue their daies ſhortned for their good, when they are ſhortned, and that in theſe, and ſuch like reſpects

                        1. That they may be 1 King. 14. 13. taken from the euill to come.
                        2. That they might be made an 1 King. 13. 14. example to others.
                        3. 
                              Iſa. 17. 1. That 1 Cor. 11. 32. by a temporall death eternall condemnation might be auoided.
                        4. That their 
                              Gen. 5. 24. Heb. 11. 5. chiefeſt and greateſt reward might be haſtened.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               §. 106. Of limiting the promiſes of temporall bleſſings.
               
               Thus we ſee there may be iuſt cauſe to alter, as the former branch of this promiſe, proſperitie, ſo the latter branch of it, long-life, and yet no wrong thereby redound to the righteous, nor benefit to the wicked.
               
                  
                  3. Queſt.
                  
                  Is not the truth of the promiſe impeached thereby?
                  Anſw. No whit at all. For firſt all promiſes of temporall bleſſings are limited with ſuch a condition as this, if the performance of it may ſtand with Gods honour, and the good of the partie to whom it is made. 2. God doth neuer ſimply depriue his Saints of that which is promiſed, but only in ſtead of it giueth a better: as in taking away wealth, he giueth the more ſtore of grace: in reſtraining liberty of body, he giueth freedome of conſcience: with affliction he giueth patience: by taking away this temporall life, he giueth eternall life. God herein dealeth, as if one who hauing promiſed ſo much iron, ſhould in ſtead thereof giue as much ſiluer: or for ſiluer giue gold: and ſo for one pound giue the worth of hundreds or thouſands.
               
            
            
               §. 107. Of appropriating proſperity and long-life to the obedience which children yeeld to their parents.
               
               
                  4. Queſt. Why is long-life and proſperity appropriated to this kinde of righteouſneſſe?
                  Anſw. It is not ſo appropriated to this, as if it appertained to no other: for it is elſewhere in generall promiſed to the 
                        Deut. 6. 2. obſeruers of the whole law, and to other particular branches thereof beſide this: yet in theſe and ſuch like particular reſpects 
                        Pſal. 34. 12, 13, 14. is it applied to the obedience of children.
                  1. Becauſe obedience to parents is one of the ſureſt euidences of our conformity to the whole law: in that thereby we ſhew our reſpect of Gods image, and lay a good foundation for the performing of all dutie to man.
                  2. Becauſe a childes performing of his dutie to his parents is vnder God an eſpeciall meanes that they doe well, and liue long (for as rebellious children make their parents with griefe to come the ſooner to their graues, ſo dutifull children make them to continue the longer in proſperity) the Lord in recompence promiſeth to ſuch a childe proſperity and long life.
                  3. Becauſe parents are an eſpeciall meanes to procure the welfare and long life of their children, partly by their prouident
                     
                     care, as Noami ſaid to Ruth, ſhall I not ſeeke reſt for thee, 
                     
                        Rut. 3. 1. 
                     that it may be well with thee? and partly by their inſtant praier: for the faithfull praier of parents is of great force with God for dutifull children: whence hath riſen the cuſtome of childrens asking their parents bleſſing, and of parents bleſſing their children. In this reſpect the law thus ſetteth forth the bleſſing of the fift commandement, they ſhall prolong thy daies. 
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                  
                  4. Becauſe diſobedience to parents bringeth much miſchiefe on childrens heads, and oft ſhorteneth their daies, and that many waies.
                  1. In that parents are oft prouoked by their childrens diſobedience How diſobedient children hinder their welfare and ſhorten their daies. to diſinherit them, at leaſt to allow them the leſſe portion, ſo as hereby it goeth not ſo well with them: yea ſome are prouoked to bring their rebellious children to the Magiſtrate, who by Gods law was to cut them off, ſo as 
                        Deut. 21. 21. thereby their life is ſhortened.
                  2. In that parents are prouoked to complaine vnto God of their childrens diſobedience, and God thereby moued both to lay heauie iudgements vpon ſuch children in their life time, and alſo to ſhorten their daies: for parents complaint doth make a loud crie in Gods eares. It is ſaid that God by cutting off Abimelech with an vntimely death rendred the 
                     
                        Judg. 9. 5 6. 
                     wickedneſſe which he did to his father.
                  
                  3. In that, when parents are too indulgent ouer their children, God doth puniſh the ſinne both of parent and childe, by ſhortning the childes daies. Inſtance the examples of 1 Sam. 2. 34. 
                     Hophni and Phinehas, 
                     2 Sam. 18. 14. 
                     Abſolom, and 1 King. 2. 25. 
                     Adonijah.
                  
                  4. In that diſobedience to parents, is a ſinne that ſeldome goeth alone: for an vndutifull childe is commonly a verie lewd perſon many other waies. Conſidering the proueneſſe of our nature to all ſinne, it cannot be auoided but that they who in the beginning ſhake off the yoake of gouernment, ſhould run headlong into all riot, looſeneſſe, and licentiouſneſſe: thus then ſinne being added vnto ſinne, it muſt needs bring miſchiefe vpon miſchiefe, till at length life be cut off.
                  Wherefore in that theſe miſchiefes are auoided by performing due obedience to parents, it may well be ſaid that it ſhall be well with obedient children, and they ſhall liue long.
                  
               
            
            
               
               §. 108. Of Gods ordering his fauours ſo as they may appeare to be true bleſſings.
               
               The particular branches of Gods promiſe hauing beene How fitly proſperity and long life are ioyned together. diſtinctly opened, we will conſider them ioyntly together, for they doe exceedingly amplifie one another: proſperity ſweetens long life and makes it acceptable: otherwiſe to liue long, namely in miſery and wretchedneſſe, is very irkſome and grieuous. Againe, long life added to proſperity maketh it ſo much the greater bleſſing. For a good thing the longer it continueth the better it is. If proſperity were but as a flower, ſoone gone, the very thought of the vanity thereof would much diminiſh the ioy and comfort of it. But both of them ioyned together, doe ſhew that this is no ſmall bleſſing which is promiſed.
               From the connexion of them both together, I obſerue that
               
                  God ſo ordereth his fauours as they appeare to be true bleſſings, 
                  God makes his ſauours true bleſſings. Gen. 17. 19. tending indeed to the good of thoſe vpon whom he beſtoweth them. Thus when God gaue Abraham a ſonne, he eſtabliſhed his couenant with him, that this gift might be a true bleſſing.
               The like I might inſtance in all the children of promiſe, as Sampſon, Salomon, Iohn Baptiſt, &c. So in other fauours. When God added fifteene yeares to Hezekiahs life, he alſo promiſed 
                     Iſa. 38. 5, 6. & 39. 8. him deliuerance from his enemies, and peace, and truth all his daies: And when God gaue Dauid a kingdome, he gaue him 2 Sam. 7. 9. &c.
                   great victories and long life, and eſtabliſhed his kingdome to his poſterity: ſo alſo dealt he with Salomon. But not to inſiſt on any more particulars, excellently is this doctrine confirmed in the 28 Pſalme.
               
               Thus God will ſhew that in loue he beſtoweth euen the temporall bleſſings which he giueth to his Saints, that accordingly they may eſteeme them, and that their hearts may be the more inlarged both to admire his goodneſſe, and to be thankfull for the ſame.
               This vſe we muſt make of thoſe things which the Lord is 1. Vſe.
                   pleaſed to beſtow vpon vs, as of long life, good health, honour, peace, plenty, liberty, and all proſperity: we muſt receiue and vſe them as God beſtoweth them, namely as tokens

of his fauour: and thereby be the more ſtirred vp to performe the duties he requireth of vs, and not abuſe them to his diſhonour and our owne hurt: but rather ſo as he may haue honour, and we profit thereby.
            
            
               §. 109. Of Gods high account of dutifull children.
               
               More particularly by this promiſe we may learne what high 2. Vſe.
                   eſteeme, and great account God maketh of dutifull children, and of that obedience which they performe to their parents: which ought ſo much the more to prouoke children to all obedience, if at leaſt they haue any care of Gods fauour, and of the tokens of his loue. Oh conſider this all yee that haue parents to honour: conſider how carefull, how earneſt God is euery way by all meanes to draw you to obedience: he contents not himſelfe to vrge the equity of the point, the place of your parent, the charge that himſelfe hath giuen, but moſt preſſeth your owne profit: and that not only in hope for the time to come, but euen in preſent fruition for this life: and that becauſe we through our childiſhneſſe are moſt affected with things ſenſible and preſent: dealing with vs as a tender father who prouideth not only a good calling, and a faire in heritance for his childe, but giueth him alſo plums, peares, and ſuch things as for the preſent he is delighted withall, the more to allure him.
            
            
               §. 110. Of childrens doing good to themſelues by honouring their parents.
               
               Children may further learne out of this promiſe, that in 3. Vſe.
                   performing their dutie they doe good not only to their parents, but alſo to themſelues: they procure their owne welfare and long-life. What egregious fooles then are diſobedient children: they regard neither God, their parents, nor themſelues, but depriue themſelues of their eternall happineſſe, hinder their welfare, and ſhorten their daies. Fitly hereupon I may applie to vndutifull children theſe words of the Pſalmiſt, Marke the obedient childe, for the end of him is peace: 
                  
                     Pſal. 37 37, 38. 
                  but the rebellious ſhall be deſtroyed: he ſhall be cut off: and theſe of the wiſe-man, I know that it ſhall be well with the dutifull 
                  
                     Eccl. 8. 12, 13. 
                  childe, but it ſhall not be well with the diſobedient, he ſhall not prolong his daies: and theſe of the Prophet, Say ye to the obedient
                  
                  childe, it ſhall be well with him, he ſhall eat the fruit of his doings, 
                  
                     Iſa. 3. 10, 11. 
                  but woe to the tranſgreſſor, it ſhall be ill with him.
               
            
            
               §. 111. Of parents doing good to their children by keeping them vnder obedience.
               
               Out of this promiſe parents may learne how to doe good 4. Uſe.
                   for their children, how to prouide for their welfare, and long to preſerue their life on earth (a thing whereunto moſt parents are naturally giuen, and whereof they are much deſirous) namely by teaching children their dutie, by keeping them vnder obedience: thus haue they Gods promiſe to aſſure them, that it ſhall goe well with their children, and that they ſhall liue long. When parents are vpon their death-beds they may reſt more ſecurely vpon this promiſe then vpon great ſtore of treaſure laid vp for them, and great reuenues reſerued for them. Many parents neglect themſelues: they moile and toile, they carke and care, they pinch and ſpare, to leaue their children ſtore of wealth, thinking thereby to doe good to their children, when as withall they too much cocker their children, giue the reines vnto them, and care not how little dutie they performe. Gods curſe will lie vpon all the ſtore that is laid vp for ſuch children, as a fire to conſume it all. Doth not daily experience verifie the truth hereof? The iudgements which are laid on ſome ſuch children, doe euidently manifeſt Gods iuſt indignation againſt all. Let not rich men therefore thinke they haue left their children well enough if they leaue them a large portion, but rather if they haue obſerued them to be obedient children: and if poore mens children be ſuch, let them not feare but that it ſhall goe well with them.
               It is ſaid, that a good trade is better then houſe and land, but by vertue of this promiſe we may ſay that obedience in a childe is better then trade and all: this is the trade of a childes 
                  
                     Prou. 22. 6. 
                  way which parents ſhould teach children. Wherefore as parents are deſirous of their childrens good, ſo they ought to be wiſe in procuring it, which is by teaching them this trade of obedience: and ſo they ſhall bring much comfort to themſelues while they liue, and good to their children after them.
            
            
               
               §. 112. Of the perpetuitie of the ſubſtance of ſuch things as in their circumſtances reſpecting the Iewes are vaniſhed.
               
               In laying downe this particular promiſe, the Apoſtle in ſtead of the limitation thereof vnto the Iewes in theſe words (in the land which the Lord thy God ſhall giue thee) putteth a generall word, which extendeth it to all nations, namely this (in the earth) whence I gather that
               
                  The ſubſtance of theſe things which in ſome circumſtances were 
                  
                     Doctr. Subſtance of promiſes made to the Iewes ſtill remaineth. 
                  after a peculiar manner reſtrained to the Iewes, remaineth in force to all Chriſtians. The ſubſtance of this promiſe was, that it ſhould goe well with obedient children, while here on earth they liued, and in this welfare they ſhould long liue. The circumſtance was, that in Canaan they ſhould inioy that bleſſing. Though Chriſtians liue not in Canaan, which is the circumſtance, yet well it ſhall goe with them, and long they ſhall liue, which is the ſubſtance. Thus though the circumſtance of Gods couenant with Abraham (which was circumciſion) be aboliſhed, yet the ſubſtance (which is, to be our God, and the God of our ſeed) remaineth. This might further be exemplified in many hundred inſtances: for the ſubſtance of all the Iewiſh ſacrifices, and Sacraments, both ordinarie, and extraordinarie, of their Sabbaths, of their faſts, of their feaſts, and the like, remaine, though the circumſtances, as ſhadowes, be vaniſhed away. Hence is it, that many promiſes made to them, are applied by the Apoſtles to Chriſtians, as this, I will not faile thee, 
                  
                     Heb. 13. 5. Act. 2. 39. 
                  nor forſake thee: and in generall it is ſaid, The promiſe to you and to your children, and to all that are afarra off.
               
               Hereby we may learne what vſe to make of the old Teſtament, Vſe. euen of thoſe promiſes and priuiledges which in ſome particular reſpects were appropriated to the Iewes: namely, by obſeruing the ſubſtance, and diſtinguiſhing it from the circumſtance; thus ſhall we finde that to be true which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of all the things which were written afore time, namely, that they were written for our learning. In this reſpect 
                     Rom. 15. 4. the ſame Apoſtle ſaith of the things recorded of Abraham, they were not written for his ſake alone: and againe of the 
                     Rom 4. 23. things recorded of the Iſraelites, they are written for our admonition. 
                  1 Cor. 10. 11. By this we may learne how to applie the preface to the

ten Commandements, which mentioneth the deliuerance of Iſrael out of the bondage of Egypt.
               Pray therefore for the ſpirit of illumination to diſcerne betwixt ſubſtance and circumſtance, in reading the old Teſtament eſpecially.
            
            
               §. 113. Of the determined period of mans life.
               
               Hauing declared ſuch orthodoxall points as this text affordeth, I will further note out two hereticall poſitions, which our aduerſaries thence raiſe. One is of thoſe, that to the diſhonour of him whom God raiſed vp to be a worthy inſtrument in diſpelling the miſt of Poperie, which had much darkned the light of the Goſpell, call themſelues Lutherans: the other of Papiſts.
               
               The former is this, God hath not determined the ſet period of 
                  Hinc pateſcit humanae vitae terminum, non eſſe decreto ſimplici & abſoluto conſtitutum, &c. Zach. Muthel. in hunc loc. & N. Heming. alij
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     . 
                  mans daies, but it is in mans power to lengthen or ſhorten them: for if it were otherwiſe, ſay they, this and ſuch like promiſes of long life were to no purpoſe, nor yet the contrary threatnings of ſhortning mans daies.
               For full anſwer hereunto, I will firſt ſhew, that the poſition it ſelfe is directly contrarie to the current of Scripture, and then diſcouer the vnſoundneſſe of their conſequence.
               Touching the determined period of mans daies, thus ſpeaketh the Scripture: Is there not an appointed time to man on 
                  Mans time ſet. Iob 7. 1. 
                  earth? are not his daies alſo as the daies of an hireling? Note with what emphaſis the point is ſet forth; euen ſo, as if it were a point ſo cleare, as none could doubt of it. Note alſo two metaphors here vſed, which doe much cleare the point: one taken from ſouldiers, the other from hired ſeruants. That of ſouldiers is implied in the meaning of the originall word tranſlated appointed time, but properly ſignifieth him that hath 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   his time appointed for warfare, or the time it ſelfe ſo appointed: the other expreſſed. Now we know that theſe times are appointed to an houre: ſo is the time of mans life. In this reſpect Iob ſaith againe, all the daies of my appointed time will I 
                  
                     Iob 14. 14. 
                  wait, &c. where he vſeth the ſame word that before in the ſame ſenſe. To this purpoſe are theſe, and ſuch like phraſes frequently vſed in Scripture, determined daies, number of daies, 
                  
                     Iob 14. 5. Eccleſ. 2. 3. Iob. 7. 30. 
                  houre, &c. Did not the Prophet expreſly declare to Hezekiah
                  
that he ſhould liue iuſt 15 yeeres after his ſickneſſe? He could 
                     Iſa. 38. 5. not haue told it, if the Lord had not before ſet that period. Chriſt ſaith, our haires are numbred, are not much more our 
                     Mat. 10. 30. & 6 27. daies? Againe he ſaith, who can adde one cubit to his ſtature? 
                  
                     Stat ſua cui
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         dies, &c. Virg. Aenied. 10. Can then any adde to his daies? So euident is this point, that the heathen noted it.
               Touching their conſequence (if a mans time be determined all the promiſes of long life are to no purpoſe) I anſwer, that God who hath ſet downe the iuſt time and period of mans life, hath alſo ſet downe the meanes of attaining to that period. Now the time he hath kept ſecret to himſelfe, the meanes he hath reuealed to vs. In regard of vs therefore who know not the time appointed of the Lord, it may be ſaid that by vſing ſuch and ſuch meanes we prolong our daies, or by doing ſuch and ſuch things we ſhorten them. Now becauſe theſe meanes only ſhew them to be long, or ſhort, Gods decree remaineth firme and ſtable, and is not altred thereby: yet this worke of lengthening or ſhortning is attributed to vs, becauſe we doe what lieth in vs thereto, and that freely without any compulſion. For Gods decree though it cauſe a neceſſitie in the euent, yet it impoſeth no conſtraint on the will of man, but leaueth it as free (in regard of the manner of working) as if there were no decree at all. And herein Gods admirable wiſdome is manifeſted, that notwithſtanding his determined purpoſe of matters, man hath no ground of excuſe to ſay he was forced to this or that.
               The knowledge of this determined period of mans life is of great vſe: for it teacheth vs,
               1. Wholly to ſubmit our ſelues to God: and to be prepared Vſes to be made of the determined time of mans life. either ſoone to depart out of this world, or long to liue in it, as God ſhall diſpoſe of our time: nor deſiring longer to liue then God hath appointed: nor grieuing to liue ſo long as he hath appointed.
               2. Not to feare the threats of any man, thereby to be drawne 
                     Dan. 3. 17, 18. from God.
               3. To doe Gods worke while we haue time, &c. 
                     Iob. 9. 4.
               
            
            
               
               §. 114. Of reward promiſed to obedience, that it implieth no merit.
               
               The other hereſie which Papiſts gather from this text, is Againſt merit. this, Mans obedience is meritorious.
               
               
                  Anſw. The reward here promiſed is no matter of wages and due deſert, but of meere grace and fauour.
               Of this error I haue

                  EPHES. 6. 4.
                  And ye fathers, prouoke not your children to wrath: but bring them vp in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
               
               THe Apoſtle hauing vrged children to performe their duties to their parents, he turneth his ſpeech to parents, ſaying, AND ye fathers, &c. That copulatiue particle AND, ioyning an exhortation to parents, for performing their duties to the forenamed exhortation made to children, giueth vs to vnderſtand, that
               
                  Parents are as well bound to dutie as children. Their duties 1. Obſeru. Parents bound to duties. indeed be different, yet (notwithſtanding their ſuperioritie and authoritie ouer their children) they are bound to dutie. All the directions and exhortations throughout the Scripture giuen vnto parents, concerning their dutie, and all the threatnings denounced, and iudgements executed on parents for neglect of their dutie, are pregnant proofes of this point.
               Though parents be ouer their children, and by them cannot be commanded, yet they are vnder God: and he it is who hath enioyned them their dutie: ſo as they are bound thereunto, as they will anſwer it to their Father in heauen.
               The authoritie which parents haue, is not ſo much for their owne aduancement, as for the better gouerning of their children, which being ſo, their verie gouernment is a dutie.
               
                  
                     Object. In the morall Law the dutie of children only is expreſſed. How parents duties are implied in the 5. Commandement.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. Parents dutie (as many others duties) is by iuſt and neceſſarie conſequence implied, which is equiualent, and as

much bindeth, as if it were expreſſed. It is thus implied. They who haue honour, muſt carrie themſelues worthie of honour. Now the way to carrie themſelues worthie of honour, is to be carefull in doing dutie to them that honour them. This is ſo equall, as it needed not to be expreſt.
                  Wherefore let Miniſters follow this patterne of the Apoſtle, 1. Vſe. Miniſters muſt prouoke parents to their dutie. and carrie an euen hand towards all of all ſorts: let them not be partiall in laying all the burden of dutie on childrens necks, and none on parents: holding in children verie ſtraitly, but leauing parents to their owne will. Parents are fleſh and bloud as well as children, and as prone to tranſgreſſe in their place, as children in theirs. Yea, Miniſters ought of the two to be more earneſt in vrging parents to performe their dutie, becauſe they are vnder no ſuch power and authoritie as children are. Feare of parents authoritie keepeth children much in awe. There is no ſuch thing to keepe parents in awe. They will be more readie therefore to take the greater libertie, if by feare of God, and by a good conſcience, they be not kept in compaſſe.
                  Now ye (ô parents) as you looke for honour, carrie yourſelues 2. Uſe.
                      worthie of honour: as ye looke for dutie from your children, performe dutie to them. Know that another day, euen you ſhall be called to an account before the higheſt Iudge: your authoritie will then be no pretence to excuſe, but an euidence to aggrauate your fault. For you being elder in yeeres, and more eminent in place, of more experience, and hauing a charge ouer your children, ought to be a light to ſhew them the way, an example to allure them, that they ſeeing you carefull and conſcionable in performing your dutie, may be the more prouoked to performe theirs, or at leaſt made aſhamed of their neglect of dutie. But if you be careleſſe of your dutie, how can ye expect dutie at their hands? nay if by your ill example they haue beene made negligent, their bloud ſhall be required at your hands.
               
            
            
               §. 116. Of the extent of theſe words, Fathers, Children.
               Though the word (Fathers) be here vſed, which properly 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . ſetteth forth naturall parents, and of naturall parents the male kinde, yet (as in many other places) it is to be taken in a larger extent: euen in as large as this word (children) was before,

that ſo there may be a iuſt and equall relation betwixt children 
                     Verſ. 1. and parents: wherefore both ſexes of naturall parents are compriſed vnder it, euen mother as well as father, and they alſo who are in place of parents, whether by mariage as all ſorts of fathers and mothers in Law, or by appointment, as all they who of right haue the cuſtodie and charge of children, as Guardians, Tutors, and other like Gouernours: and ſo it is euerie way anſwerable to the word (parents) vſed in the firſt verſe: and the word (children) is alſo here to be taken in the ſame extent, as it was there.
            
            
               §. 117. Of parents prouoking children.
               
               The next phraſe (prouoke to wrath) is the expoſition of one 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Greeke word, which being a compound word, cannot by one Engliſh word be fully expreſſed: the beſt and neereſt that I can thinke of is (exaſperate.) The word ſignifieth an extremitie in the vſe of authoritie: euen too much auſteritie and ſeueritie, whereby children are prouoked to wrath: which becauſe it is a fault, it is here expreſly forbidden (prouoke not, &c.) In this word there is a trope: the effect is put for the cauſe: The Apoſtles meaning is, that parents ſhould take ſuch heed of their cariage toward their children, as they giue them no occaſion to be ſtirred vp to wrath. Vnder this word then are forbidden Occaſions of prouoking children to wrath. all ſuch things, as may kindle wrath in children, as too much auſteritie in cariage, ſowreneſſe in countenance, threatning and reuiling in words, too hard handling, too ſeuere correction, too much reſtraint of libertie, too ſmall allowance of things needfull, with the like. Parents being fleſh and bloud are ſubiect in this kinde to abuſe their authoritie: yea, euen they who fall into the other extreme of too much indulgencie and cockering of their children, are verie prone to fall alſo into this extreme: as many who for the moſt part too much ſuffer their children without due reſtraint and correction to runne into all riot, will ſometimes on a ſudden, like Lions, flie vpon them, and after their owne pleaſure correct them, and ſo exceedingly prouoke 
                     Heb. 12. 10. their children. Such as are moſt cockering, are moſt prone to prouoke to wrath: for, 1. Such leaſt know how to keepe a meane: one will ſooner leape out of one extreme into another,

then goe from an extreme to the meane. 2. The children of ſuch are ſooneſt prouoked.
               
                  
                     Queſt. Is it a thing lawfull and iuſtifiable in children to be prouoked to wrath by their parents?
                  
                     Anſw. 
                     See Treat. 5. §. 31, 41. No. This prohibition intendeth no ſuch thing: the Apoſtle hath here to doe with parents: and inſtructeth them how to preuent ſuch miſchiefes as their children through their weakneſſe may fall into. So as here only he ſheweth what is vnlawfull for parents, not what is lawfull for children. Hence then by the way I obſerue that
                  
                     Parents muſt be ſo watchfull ouer their cariage, as thereby they 
                     2. Obſer.
                      
                     make not their children to ſinne.
                  
                  If they doe, they make their owne ſinne the more hainous, and alſo they pull downe vpon their owne pates a farre more heauie vengeance, euen the vengeance of their owne ſinne, and the vengeance of their childes ſinne. For euery parent is made a watchman ouer his childe. If a watchman doe not 
                        Ezec. 3. 18. what he can to hinder the ſinne of ſuch as are vnder his charge, he pulls their bloud on his owne necke. What doe they then that being watchmen, miniſter occaſion of ſinne to them that are vnder their charge?

               That parents by auoiding the rocke of prouoking, fall not into the gulfe of cockering, the Apoſtle addeth a BVT, which is 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . as a ſtop vnto them, and teacheth them that

                  children may fall into, but they muſt alſo ſeeke their good. All the precepts in Scripture charging parents to ſeeke their childrens good, proue the point. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt the affection which parents and ſtrangers ought to beare toward children, and the dutie which one and the other owe to them. Meere ſtrangers ought not to prouoke them: but parents ought moreouer euery way to ſeeke their good.
               The maine good which parents ought eſpecially to ſeeke after in the behalfe of their children, is noted out in theſe words: Bring them vp in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
               
               The word tranſlated (bring vp) properly ſignifieth to feed

Fr. at firſt ſight to be here placed only to make vp the ſenſe, as if he had thus ſaid, nurture your childe in the wayes of God. But if the ſcope of the Apoſtle, and ſignification of the word be well weighed, we ſhall finde that it further implieth a generall dutie, which nature it ſelfe teacheth parents, euen this, that
               
                  Parents ought to prouide all needfull things for their children:

But the Apoſtle hath thus neerely and conciſely ioyned them together, to ſhew that Nurture and inſtruction is as needfull and profitable, as food and apparell.

Both ſenſes will here ſtand, and our Engliſh word (as well as the Greeke) will beare both: for to nurture children, is as well to correct them, as to inſtruct them. Verie fitly is this aduice in this large acceptation inferred vpon the former prohibition: for leſt parents ſhould thereupon take occaſion to lay the reines vpon their childrens necks, and let them run whither they liſt, the Apoſtle hereby teacheth, that
               
                  Parents, as they may not be too auſtere, ſo neither too remiſſe.

                   Greeke notation thereof doth further ſet forth the meane betwixt the two forenamed extremes: for it noteth out ſuch a diſcipline as befitteth a lad, or a young childe: ſo as the thing it ſelfe, diſcipline, by inſtruction and correction keepeth

from one extreme of remiſneſſe: the kinde or manner of diſcipline being ſuch as befitteth a childe, keepeth from the other extreme of rigour and crueltie. Extremes on either ſide are dangerous and pernicious, and that to parent and childe. For remiſneſſe will make children careleſſe of all dutie to God and parent: rigour will make them deſperate. But vertue and ſafetie conſiſteth in the meane betwixt both.

               The more paines is taken in this kinde, the leſſe labour will be loſt. That which at firſt is little heeded, by much vrging and preſsing will for euer be held, as a naile that at one blow ſcarſe entreth, with many blowes is knockt vp to the head.
            
            
               § 121. Of adding information to diſcipline.
               
               The addition of this word admonition vnto nurture, is not (as ſome take it) a meere explication of the ſame point, but alſo a declaration of a further dutie, which is this:
               
                  As parents by diſcipline keepe their children vnder, ſo by information 
                  8. Obſer.
                   
                  they muſt direct them in the right way. Salomon doth both deliuer the point, and alſo adde a good reaſon to inforce it: for ſaith he, Traine vp a childe in the way that he ſhould goe; there is the dutie: and when he is old, he will not depart from it; there 
                     Pro. 22. 6. is the reaſon. Keeping a childe vnder by good diſcipline, may make him dutifull while the father is ouer him: but well informing

his vnderſtanding and iudgement, is a meanes to vphold him in the right way ſo long as he liueth.
            
            
               §. 122. Of parents teaching their children the feare of God.
               
               The laſt word (of the Lord) intimateth the beſt dutie that

Admonition of the Lord, declareth ſuch principles as a parent hath receiued from the Lord, and learned out of Gods word: ſuch as may teach a childe to feare the Lord, ſuch as tend to true pietie and religion: whence further I obſerue, that

               §. 123. Of the ſubiection which beleeuing ſeruants owe.
               
               Becauſe there is yet another order in the family beſides thoſe which haue been noted before, namely the order of Maſters & ſeruants, the Apoſtle preſcribeth alſo vnto them their dutie.
               As he began with wiues and children, in the two former orders, ſo here he beginneth with ſeruants who are the inferiours, for the ſame reaſons §. 10. Why the Apoſtle is ſo copious in vrging ſeruants to their dutie. before rendred.
               The Apoſtle is ſomewhat copious in laying forth the duties of ſeruants, and in vrging them to performe their dutie; and that for two eſpeciall reaſons: One in reſpect of thoſe, whoſe maſters were infidels: another in reſpect of thoſe, whoſe maſters were Saints.
               1. Many ſeruants there were in thoſe daies wherein the 
                     Seruus beneuolentia proſequatur dominum, quamuis impiū. Qui fidelem habet dominum, ſaluo eius dominio, diligat vt patrem. Conſlit. Apoſt. li. 4. ca. 12. Gal. 4. 28. Goſpell was firſt preached to the Gentiles, that by the preaching thereof were conuerted, whoſe maſters embraced not the Goſpell: whereupon thoſe ſeruants began to conceit that they being Chriſtians, ought not to be ſubiect to their maſters that were infidels.
               2. Other ſeruants there were whoſe Maſters beleeued the Goſpell as well as they: now becauſe the Goſpell taught, that there is neither bond nor free, but all are one in Chriſt Ieſus: they thought that they ought not to be ſubiect to their maſter who was their brother in Chriſt.
               Theſe two prepoſterous and preſumptuous conceits doth the Apoſtle intimate, and expreſly meet with in 1 Tim. 6. 1, 2. another

place. And becauſe they had taken too deepe rooting in the mindes of many ſeruants, the Apoſtle here in this place laboureth the more earneſtly to root them out, and that by a thorow preſſing vpon their conſcience that ſubiection wherein they are bound to their maſters, as maſters, whatſoeuer their diſpoſition were. Hereof more Treat. 7. §. 2, 3. afterwards.
               Here by the way, note three points.

               THis title (Seruants) is a generall title, which may be applied

                   Apoſtles indefinite title (ſeruants) admitteth no exception of any.
               The other title (Maſters) hath as large an extent compriſing 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . What maſters are meant. vnder it both ſexes, Maſters and Miſtreſſes: and of theſe all ſorts, great and meane, rich and poore, ſtrong and weake,

faithfull and infidels, true profeſſors and profane; ſuperſtitious, idolatrous, hereticall perſons, or the like: ſo as
               
                  No condition or diſpoſition of the maſter exempteth a ſeruant 
                  5. Obſeru.
                   
                  from performing dutie to him.
               
               Among other degrees and differences, moſt eſpecially let it be noted that both ſexes, miſtreſſes as well as maſters, are here meant, that ſo the duties which are enioyned to be performed to maſters may anſwerably be performed to miſtreſſes (ſo farre as they are common to both) and that both by maidſeruants, and alſo by men-ſeruants that are vnder miſtreſſes. In families miſtreſſes are as ordinary as maſters, and therefore I thought good to giue an eſpeciall item of this.
               Vnder this word (obey) are compriſed all thoſe duties which 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . ſeruants owe to their maſters: it is the ſame word that was before vſed in the firſt verſe: and it hath as large an extent here being applied to ſeruants, as it had there being applied to children: It ſheweth that
               
                  The rule of ſeruants (as ſeruants) is the will of their Maſter. 
                  6. Obſeru. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
               
               This clauſe (according to the fleſh) is by ſome referred to the action of obedience, as if it were added by the Apoſtle to ſhew what kinde of obedience ſeruants owe to their maſters, namely a ciuill, corporall obedience in temporall things, oppoſed to that ſpirituall obedience which is due to God alone.
               
                  Anſ. Though diſtinction may be made betwixt that ſeruice which is due to God, and that which is due to man, yet this application of this phraſe in this place may giue occaſion to ſeruants to thinke that if they performe outward ſeruice to their maſters all is well, they owe no inward feare, or honour, which is an error that the Apoſtle doth here mainly oppoſe againſt.
               But becauſe this clauſe (according to the fleſh) is immediatly Why maſters are ſaid to be after the fleſh. Dominis carnalibus. vet. tranſl.
                   ioyned to Maſters, I referre it to the perſons to whom obedience is to be giuen, and ſo take it as a deſcription of them, as if he had ſaid, to fleſhly or bodily Maſters.
               
               The Apoſtle thus deſcribeth maſters for theſe reaſons.
               1. For diſtinction: to ſhew he meanes ſuch maſters as are of the ſame mould that ſeruants are: ſo diſtinguiſhing them from God who is a ſpirit: thus doth the Apoſtle diſtinguiſh betwixt fathers of our fleſh, and father of ſpirits. 
                  
                     Heb. 12. 9.
               
               
                  
2. For preuention: left ſeruants might ſay, our maſters are fleſh and bloud as we are, why then ſhould we be ſubiect to them? To meet with that conceit, the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith that obedience is due to maſters after the fleſh.
               
               3. For mitigation of their ſeruitude: for their maſters being fleſh, they haue no power but ouer the bodies of their ſeruants: their ſpirits are free from them: in which reſpect the Apoſtle calleth Chriſtian ſeruants the Lords freemen. 
                  1 Cor. 7. 22.
               
               4. For conſolation againſt their preſent condition, which is but for a time, becauſe their maſters are fleſh: whatſoeuer is according to the fleſh is of no long continuance, but hath his date.
               5. For direction: to ſhew in what things eſpecially that obedience which properly belongeth to a maſter conſiſteth: namely in ciuill, outward things: for euery one muſt be ſerued according to his nature. As God being ſpirit, muſt in ſpirit be ſerued: ſo man being fleſh muſt in fleſh be ſerued. Now this ſeruice in the fleſh is not oppoſed to ſincere and vpright ſeruice, but to ſpirituall. Thus by conſequence that may be intended, which ſome would haue principally to be meant.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Maſters may command ſpirituall things, namely to worſhip God, and after ſuch and ſuch a manner.
                  
                     Anſw. Of his owne head he cannot command ſuch things: there muſt be an higher warrant for the doing of them then the commandement of a man.
                  A maine point here intended is this, that
                  
                     Maſters are not to be lightly reſpected becauſe they be after the 
                     7. Obſeru.
                      
                     fleſh: that is, weake, fraile, of ſhort continuance, of the ſame nature that ſeruants are.
                  Leſt vpon the forenamed deſcription of maſters, ſeruants Seruants feare of their maſters. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . ſhould take to themſelues too much heart, the Apoſtle annexeth this clauſe (with feare and trembling, &c.) which hath relation to the manner of their obedience. No ſlauiſh feare is here meant, as if ſeruants ſhould liue in continuall dread, or tremble at the ſight of their maſters: a ſeruant by the tyrannie of ſome maſter may be brought ſo to doe: but to doe ſo is no Chriſtian dutie: that which the Apoſtle here requireth is a

dutie belonging to all Chriſtian ſeruants towards all ſorts of maſters, euen the mildeſt that be. It is therefore an awfull reſpect of the authority of a maſter, and a dutifull reuerence to his perſon which is here required: and it is oppoſed to ſawcineſſe, malepartneſſe, boldneſſe, ſtoutneſſe, anſwering againe, murmuring and muttering againſt their maſters, and other like vices. To ſhew how foule thoſe faults be, and what great reſpect ſeruants ought to beare to their maſters, theſe two words (feare, and trembling) are ioyned together: which in Difference betwixt feare and trembling.
                      effect declare one and the ſame thing: but yet for explication ſake they may be diſtinguiſhed. For

                     Feare ſignifieth a reuerend reſpect of one: it is that which in the former Chapter was required of wiues: though the thing in generall which is required of wiues and ſeruants is the ſame, yet the particular manner and meaſure of a ſeruants feare is farre different.

                        . 
                     Trembling is more proper to ſeruants: it is a dread of puniſhment: and it is required of ſeruants, not as if they ſhould doe all things ſimply for feare of puniſhment, but becauſe God hath put a ſtaffe into a maſters hands, ſeruants muſt tremble at that power their maſters haue, and feare to prouoke them to ſtrike. To this purpoſe ſaith the Apoſtle to ſubiects in regard of the power which a Magiſtrate hath, be afraid, for 
                     
                        Rom. 13. 3, 4.

                  Hence learne that
                  
                     The authority of a Maſter ought to ſtrike a ſeruants heart with

                     dread.
                  
                  The dread which ſeruants ought to haue of their maſters power and authority maketh many to care for no more then to auoid their maſters diſpleaſure: wherefore the Apoſtle addeth a further degree of a ſeruants ſubiection, namely that 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . it be in ſingleneſſe of heart, that is, honeſt, intire, vpright: for this is oppoſed to hypocriſie, diſſimulation, and fraud: yea of YOVR heart, not anothers: another in the ſimplicity of his heart may thinke you doe a thing better then you doe, by a charitable conſtruction of euerie thing, but if in ſingleneſſe of your owne heart you doe it, it will in truth be as it appeareth to be. So as
                  
                     
                     All the ſeruices which ſeruants performe to their maſters muſt

                  The Apoſtle giues this direction to Chriſtians who haue to doe not only with maſters according to the fleſh (who only ſee the outward appearance) but alſo with the maſter of ſpirits 1 Sam. 16. 7. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . who looketh on the heart: and therefore alſo he added this clauſe, as vnto Chriſt: teaching ſeruants thereby that
                  
                     Seruants in their obedience to their maſters, muſt approue 
                     10. Obſeru.
                      
                     themſelues to Ieſus Chriſt as well as to their maſters after the fleſh.
                  
                  This phraſe (as vnto Chriſt) implieth as much as that (in the Lord) whereof we ſpake §. 96. before.

                  EPHES. 6. 6.
                  Not with eie ſeruice, as men-pleaſers, but as the ſeruants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart.
               
               THis and the verſe following are added as a further explication of the laſt clauſe of the former verſe. It ſhould ſeeme that ſeruants, howſoeuer they might in ſome meaſure performe the maine dutie of obedience, yet failed exceedingly in the manner of performing it. Becauſe maſters were but men, maſters according to the fleſh, who neither had power ouer the heart, nor could diſcerne the diſpoſition thereof, ſeruants thought they had well done their dutie, if they had outwardly performed what their maſter required: now to root out this bitter weed, and to reforme this corrupt conceit, the Apoſtle is more large in cleering the point of ſincere and vpright ſeruice: therefore, the more fully to expreſſe his minde and meaning, firſt he layeth downe the vice contrarie to the foreſaid ſincerity (for contraries laid together doe much ſet forth one Oppoſita iuxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt. another) and then returneth more diſtinctly to declare the vertue. Whence note
               
                  Thoſe points are moſt to be vrged vpon people, wherein they

               The vice here noted to be contrarie to ſincere ſeruice is termed 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  eie-ſeruice. Our Engliſh word doth properly and fitly anſwer

the originall, both in the notation, and in the true ſenſe and meaning of it. It implieth a meere outward ſeruice only What eie-ſeruice is. to ſatisfie the eie of man:
               
                  
                     
                        And that is twofold,
                        
                           Hypocriticall,
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Paraſiticall.
                        
                         
                     
                  
               
               
                  Hypocriticall ſeruice is that which is meerely in ſhew: when that is pretended to be done which indeed is not done; as if a ſeruant ſhould come from his maſters worke all in a ſweat, as if he had taken extraordinary paines therein, whereas he hath done nothing at all, but otherwiſe made himſelfe to ſweat, or only made a ſhew of ſweat.
               
                  Paraſiticall ſeruice is that which is indeed done, but in preſence of the maſter: ſuch ſeruants are they who will be very diligent and faithfull in doing ſuch things as their maſters ſee, or ſhall come to their notice: but otherwiſe behinde their maſters backe, and in things which they hope ſhall neuer come to his knowledge, they will be as negligent, and vnfaithfull as if they were no ſeruants. Yet to ſatisfie their maſters, and to ſooth them, they will doe any thing though neuer ſo vnlawfull.
               From this vice thus diſcouered note, that
               
                  God requireth more then that which may ſatisfie mans eie. 
                  11. Obſer.
                   Gods eie is a piercing eie, and can ſee much foulneſſe, where to mans eie all things ſeeme very faire: ſo as they much deceiue themſelues who thinke all is well becauſe no man can ſay to them, blacke is thine eie.
               
               Thoſe that content themſelues with doing eie-ſeruice the Men pleaſers. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   Apoſtle here termeth men-pleaſers: which title he giueth vnto them for two eſpeciall reaſons.
               1. To ſhew the ground of eie-ſeruice: which is becauſe all their care is to pleaſe their maſter, who is a man: for well they know that man can ſee but the outward ſhew, or that which is done before his face.
               2. To ſhew the hainouſneſſe of that ſinne: for it is tainted with Atheiſme, in that the man guilty thereof hath no reſpect to God: but preferreth his maſter before God: he careth not to pleaſe God ſo he pleaſe his maſter: for this is the emphaſis of that word (men-pleaſers) It is ſpoken in oppoſition to God,

as the Apoſtle implieth in another place, ſaying, If I yet pleaſed 
                  
                     Gal. 1. 10. 
                  men, I ſhould not be the ſeruant of Chriſt.
               
               
                  Obiect. How can it be ſo hainous a ſinne to be men-pleaſers, 
                  
                     Tit. 2. 9. when the Apoſtle aduiſeth ſeruants to pleaſe their maſters in all things?
               
               1. Anſw. The aduice there giuen is not ſimply to pleaſe, but to 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  pleaſe well, as the originall word properly ſignifieth, and the Kings tranſlators haue fitly turned it.
               2. Anſw. That generall particle (all things) muſt be reſtrained How maſters are to be pleaſed in all things. to the duties of a ſeruant, and to all the parts of obedience, which he there mentioneth in the words immediatly going before. Seruants therefore muſt pleaſe their maſters in all things that their maſters haue power to require at their hands, and they are bound to doe. Men-pleaſing, here ſpoken of, is oppoſed to pleaſing of God. Pleaſing of men there mentioned is ſubordinate to our pleaſing of God: here to pleaſe men is to ſooth them vp in euerie thing good or euill: there to pleaſe them is conſcionably to obey them in euerie lawfull thing. Here is condemned a ſeeking to pleaſe men in the firſt place, and that only, and wholly in euery thing, whereas we ought firſt to ſeeke Gods approbation, then the teſtimony of a good conſcience, and after theſe a pleaſing of men, but in, for, and vnder God. Hence then obſerue that
               
                  A ſeruant muſt not wholly giue himſelfe to ſooth and pleaſe 
                  12. Obſeru.
                   
                  his maſter: for ſo may he in many things highly diſpleaſe Almighty God.
               To auoid the two forenamed ſinnes, eie-ſeruice, and men-pleaſing, the Apoſtle giueth an excellent direction in theſe words, as the ſeruants of Chriſt doing the will of God from the heart, where we may obſerue Seruants of Chriſt to be oppoſed to men-pleaſers, and doing Gods will from the heart to eie-ſeruice.
               
               
                  Seruants of Chriſt, are they who know that their maſters are in 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Chriſts place, beare his image, haue their authority from him, and are vnder him: ſo as in ſeruing their maſters they ſerue Who are ſeruants of Chriſt. Chriſt: and ſo farre as they may ſerue both together, they will: but if they proue contrarie maſters, and thereupon one of neceſſity muſt be left, then they will cleaue vnto the higheſt maſter, which is Chriſt: and in this reſpect they are called the
                  
                  Lords freemen, 1. Cor. 7. 22. Thus we ſee how a ſeruant may 
                     Quo pacto ſervus non eſt ſervus? Cum prop ter Deum omnia facit. Chryſ. in 1 Cor. 7. hom. 19. be no ſeruant, if he doe all things for the Lord.
               From this oppoſition betwixt men-pleaſers and ſeruants of Chriſt, note that
               
                  They who in all things giue themſelues to pleaſe men are no ſeruants of Chriſt.
               
               That we may the better know who are ſeruants of Chriſt, 13. Obſeru.
                   the Apoſtle addeth a deſcription of them in theſe words (doing the will of God from the heart.) Chriſts will is Gods will: for as Chriſt is God, the fathers will and his is all one: as he is man he wholly ordereth his will by his fathers, he ſeeketh not 
                  
                     Ioh. 5. 30. 
                  his owne will, but the will of the father that ſent him.
               
               This deſcription of a ſeruant of Chriſt the Apoſtle addeth partly as a direction to ſeruants to teach them how in ſeruing their maſters, they may be ſeruants of Chriſt, (namely, in hauing an eie to Gods word, whereby his will is reuealed both for the matter and manner of all things which they doe) and partly as a motiue to perſwade them to be content with their place, and cheerefully to doe their dutie, becauſe ſo is the will of God.
               
                  Gods will is that which muſt direct and ſettle euery one in the 
                  14. Obſeru.
                   
                  things which they doe: for Gods will is the rule of that which is right. Euery thing is very right which he willeth: and nothing is right that ſwerueth from his will.
               To put a difference betwixt Chriſt and other maſters, and to ſhew that he looketh not (as man doth) vpon the outward appearance, but beholdeth the heart, the Apoſtle annexeth this clauſe (from the heart.) And it declareth that
               
                  A good thing muſt be well done. To doe that which is Gods 15. Obſeru.
                   will, commended by his word, is for ſubſtance a good thing: to doe it from the heart, is the right manner of doing it: That which being good is done after a right manner, is well done.
               
            
            
               
               §. 126. Of the meaning of the ſeuenth verſe.
               
               EPHES. 6. 7. With good will doing ſervice as to the Lord and not to men.
               IN this verſe the Apoſtle doth yet againe inculcate the forenamed point concerning ſeruants manner of obeying their maſters, and their care therein to approue themſelues to their higheſt maſter: whence obſerue that
               
                  Matters needfull and weightie are againe and againe to be preſſed. 
                  16. Obſeru.
                   This is a needfull point, becauſe ſeruants exceedingly faile therein: and a weightie point it is, becauſe all the comfort and benefit of ſeruice conſiſteth in Gods approbation. But the former point is not here meerely and barely repeated, but ſo ſet downe as other good directions are afforded to ſeruants What it is to ſerue with good will. for their manner of obedience.
               1. To ſerue with good will, is ſomewhat more then with ſingleneſſe of heart. For it further implieth
               1. A readineſſe and cheerefulneſſe in doing a thing; a doing it with a good minde, as the notation of the Greeke word 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . ſheweth.
               2. A deſire and endeuour that their maſters may reape profit and benefit by their ſeruice: whereby they ſhew that they beare a good will, and good minde to their maſters.
               In ſetting downe ſeruants duties, the Apoſtle vſeth another word then before in the fift verſe, namely this (doing ſeruice) 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . wherby he ſheweth that a ſeruants place and dutie is of a more abiect and inferiour kinde then the place and dutie of a childe or a wife: the former word (
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  obey) was common to all: this word (
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  doing ſeruice) is proper to ſeruants: and the very title of a 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  ſeruant, is deriued from thence. Hence note that
               
                  Though wiues and children be inferiours as well as ſeruants, yet 
                  17. Obſeru.
                   
                  may not ſeruants looke for ſuch priuiledges as they haue. Another manner of ſubiection muſt be performed by ſeruants.
               The clauſe annexed (as to the Lord) is in effect the ſame 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . with that in the 5. verſe (as to Chriſt) for by the Lord he here meaneth The Lord Chriſt. But it is added to meet with a ſecret Obiection. For if ſeruants ſhould ſay, You require us to ſerue 
                  Obiect.
                  
                  our maſters with good will, but what if they be hard-hearted and regard not our good will, but peruert our good minde? The Apoſtle Anſw. giueth them this anſwer, Looke not ſo much to men and their reward, as to God and his reward: ſerue men in and for the Lord, euen as if you ſerued God: ſo ſhall not your ſeruice be in vaine. The inference of the eighth verſe vpon this, ſheweth that this is it which the Apoſtle here intendeth. Learne therefore that
               
                  An eie is to be caſt vpon God euen in thoſe duties which we performe 
                  18. Obſeru.
                   
                  to men: and that both for approbation and reward from God.
               The negatiue clauſe which followeth in theſe words (and not to men) is not ſimplie to be taken (for then would it thwart the maine ſcope of the Apoſtle in this place) but comparatiuely in relation to God, and that in two reſpects.
               1. That ſeruice be not done only to men.
               2. That ſeruice be not done to men in and for themſelues. Seruice muſt be done to God as well as men: yea In that ſeruice 
                  19. Obſeru.
                   
                  which we doe to men, we muſt ſerue God. Men muſt be ſerued for the Lords ſake, becauſe the Lord hath commanded it, becauſe they beare the Lords image, and ſtand in his ſtead: in the Lord, and vnder the Lord.
               From this large declaration of the manner of doing ſeruice Difference betwixt ſeruants of men, and of Chriſt. to maſters note the difference betwixt ſuch ſeruants as are ſeruants of men, and ſuch as are ſeruants of Chriſt.
                  
                     1. They doe all to the eie. Theſe all from the heart.
                     2. They ſeeke to pleaſe men. Theſe doe the will of God.
                     3. They doe their ſeruice diſcontentedly. Theſe cheerefully.
                     4. They doe all vpon ſelfe-loue. Theſe with good will.

                  EPHES. 6. 8.
                  Knowing that whatſoeuer good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receiue of the Lord whether he be bond or free.
               
               GReat is the ingratitude of many maſters: they will exact Why ſeruants are put in minde of Gods reward. all the ſeruice that a poore ſeruant poſſibly can doe, but ſlenderly recompence his paines: yea, it may be, very euilly reward

the ſame, not affording competent food, clothing, lodging, but frownes, checkes, and blowes. Now to vphold ſeruants in ſuch ſtraits, and to incourage them to doe their dutie whether their maſters regard it or no, the Apoſtle in this verſe laboureth to raiſe vp their mindes to God: and to ſhew vnto them that he regardeth them, and will ſufficiently reward them, ſo as
               
                  Seruants labour ſhall not be in vaine in the Lord. To preſſe 20. Obſer.
                   this incouragement the more vpon them, he ſetteth it downe as a thing granted by all, ſo cleere as none of them can be ignorant thereof (Knowing) as if he had ſaid, ye all well enough 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . know that what I now ſay is moſt true: hence note that
               
                  Gods reſpect of faithfull ſeruants is ſo well knowne, as none that 
                  21. Obſer.
                   
                  haue any vnderſtanding can be ignorant thereof.
               
               The Apoſtles argument is drawne from the generall to a particular, 
                  A genere ad ſpeciem. and the generality is noted in the thing done (whatſoeuer) and in the perſon that doth it (any man.) But becauſe the generalitie of the thing might be too farre ſtretched, he addeth this limitation (good) and becauſe the generalitie of the perſon might be too much reſtrained, he addeth this explication (whether bond or free.) This diſtinction is vſed becauſe in thoſe daies many ſeruants were bond-men and bondwomen. Now the Apoſtles argument may thus be framed: Euery one of what eſtate and degree ſoeuer he be, ſhall be rewarded of God for euery good thing he doth, be it great or ſmall. Therefore euery ſeruant ſhall be rewarded of God for euery good ſeruice.
               
               The recompence promiſed is ſet forth vnder a conciſe ſpeech (the ſame ſhall he receiue) meaning that he ſhall receiue

                     . a reward for the ſame: that phraſe hath relation to the crop which an husbandman receiueth of the corne he ſowed, which is of the ſame kinde he ſowed: 1 Cor. 15. 38. the ſeed being wheat, the crop is of wheat: the 2 Cor. 9. 6. ſeed being plentifully ſowed, the crop will be plentifull: to the ſame purpoſe ſaith this Apoſtle in another place, whatſoeuer a man ſoweth 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  reape. Now to applie this, ſeruants that by their faithfull ſeruice bring honour and glory to God, ſhall againe receiue honour and glorie. If they aske of whom they ſhall receiue it, the

Apoſtle expreſly anſwereth, Of the Lord: for it is the Lord that 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . ſaid, 1 Sam. 2. 30. 
                  Them that honour me will I honour. God will not forget them, though their maſters may.
               From this verſe thus opened, I gather theſe particular obſeruations, concerning ſeruants.
               1. Seruants may and ought to applie vnto themſelues generall 
                  22. Obſer.
                   
                  promiſes made to Chriſtians. Otherwiſe this generall argument of the Apoſtle is to little purpoſe in this place.
               2. A Chriſtian may be a bond-ſlaue: for the Apoſtle directeth this incouragement to Chriſtians, among whom he preſuppoſeth 23. Obſer.
                   ſome to be ſlaues, oppoſing them to free-men, who alſo were ſeruants.
               3. Faithfull ſeruice performed to men is a good thing: for the 24. Obſer.
                   good things which ſeruants eſpecially doe is in their ſeruice.
               4. As God accepteth not men becauſe they are free, ſo neither 
                  25. Obſer.
                   
                  reiecteth he them becauſe they are bond. It is not the perſon, but the worke that he regardeth.
               5. The faithfull ſeruice of ſeruants is as good ſeed ſowen: it 26. Obſer.
                   will bring forth a good crop. The metaphor here intimated implieth as much.
               6. God is honoured by the faithfull ſeruice of ſeruants: this is 27. Obſer.
                   intimated by the application of Gods reward to them, for God honoureth none but them which honour him.
            
            
               §. 128. Of the connexion of maſters duties with ſeruants.
               
               
                  EPHES. 6. 9.
                  And ye maſters doe the ſame things vnto them, forbearing threatning: knowing that your maſter alſo is in heauen: neither is there reſpect of perſons with him.
               
               TO the duties of ſeruants the Apoſtle adioyneth the duties of maſters, ſaying, AND ye maſters: whence learne that
               
                  Maſters are as well bound to dutie as ſeruants. A like doctrine was noted from the connexion of parents duties with childrens: there you may ſee this generall further amplified, 
                  1. Obſer.
                   §. 115.
               1. Gods law requireth as much: for it expreſly inioyneth

many duties to maſters (as in the eighth treatiſe following we ſhall ſee.)
               2. So doth alſo the law of nature which hath tied maſter and ſeruant together by a mutuall and reciprocall bond, of doing good, as well as of receiuing good.
               3. The law of nations requireth alſo as much: For in all nations where euer there was any good gouernment, and where wiſe, and good lawes were made, particular lawes of the duties of maſters haue beene made.
               4. The law of equitie doth ſo alſo. One good deſerueth another good: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith to maſters, giue vnto your ſeruants that which is iuſt and equall. 
                  
                     Col. 4. 1.
               
               Now let maſters take notice hereof: and know that God the great Lord of all hath made this relation betwixt maſter and ſeruant, and hath ſet each of them in their ſeuerall and diſtinct places for the mutuall good of one another, ſo as ſeruants are no more for the good of maſters, then maſters are for the good of ſeruants. Wherefore, as they looke for dutie, let them performe dutie: if ſeruants faile in their dutie, let maſters ſee if they themſelues be not the cauſe thereof, by failing in theirs. Their authoritie will be no excuſe before Chriſt, but a meanes to aggrauate their fault, and increaſe their condemnation: for the greater the talent is, the more diligence is expected, and the ſtraiter account ſhall be exacted.
            
            
               §. 129. Of the meaning of this phraſe, Doe the ſame things.
               Theſe two titles (Maſters, Seruants) are ſo taken here as they were §. 124. before in the fift verſe.
               All the duties of maſters are compriſed vnder this phraſe, doe the ſame things: which at firſt ſight may ſeeme to be ſomewhat 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . ſtrange: for may ſome ſay, The things which ſeruants muſt doe are theſe, to feare, to obey, to doe ſeruice, with the like, and are maſters to doe the ſame things?
               
               
                  Anſw. 1. Theſe words are not to be referred to thoſe particular duties which are proper to ſeruants, but to thoſe generall rules of equitie which are common to maſters as well as ſeruants; namely, that in their ſeuerall places, with ſingleneſſe of heart, as vnto Chriſt, not with eie ſeruice as men pleaſers, but as the ſeruants of Chriſt they doe the will of God from the heart.
               
               
                  
2. Thoſe words may be referred to the eight verſe, the verſe going immediatly before, which laieth downe a generall rule for all men in their ſeuerall places to doe the good things of their places. Now then as ſeruants muſt haue an eie to their places to doe the good things thereof, ſo maſters muſt doe the ſame things: that is, they muſt haue an eie to their places, to doe the good things thereof.
               3. Thoſe words may be taken without reference to any former words, and expounded of a mutuall, reciprocall, and proportionable dutie that ought to paſſe betwixt maſter and ſeruant: not in the particulars, as if the ſame duties were to be performed by each of them, for that were to ouerthrow the order and degrees which God hath ſet betwixt maſter and ſeruant, to croſſe Gods ordinance, and inferre contradiction: but in generall, that duties are to be performed of each to other: in which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaid §. 3. before of all ſorts, ſuperiours, and inferiours, Submit your ſelues one to another. And thus by this phraſe the doctrine before mentioned is confirmed, that Maſters are as well bound to dutie as ſeruants.
               
               None of theſe anſwers thwart another, but all of them may well be admitted, and all of them well ſtand together. They all imply a common equitie betwixt maſters and ſeruants, but no equalitie: mutuall duties, but diuers and diſtinct duties, appertaining to their ſeuerall places. Compare with this text, that which the Apoſtle himſelfe hath more plainly and fully noted (Col. 4. 1.) and we ſhall obſerue him to expound his own meaning, for that which here he implieth vnder this phraſe (the ſame things) that he expreſſeth there vnder theſe two words, iuſt, equall: whereof we ſhall Treat. 8. §. 20, 44. hereafter more diſtinctly ſpeake.
               Purpoſely doth the Apoſtle infold maſters duties vnder this generall phraſe (the ſame things) to preuent a ſecret obiection raiſed from the eminency and ſuperioritie of maſters aboue ſeruants, which maketh them thinke, that ſeruants are only for the vſe of maſters, and that maſters are no way tied to their ſeruants. But if in the generall maſters muſt doe the ſame things, then they are for their ſeruants good, as well as ſeruants for theirs.
            
            
               
               §. 130. Of maſters forbearing threatning.
               
               The Apoſtle in theſe words (forbearing threatning) doth 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . not ſimply forbid all manner of threatning, but only preſcribe a moderation thereof: and Or, moderating. ſo much haue the Kings tranſlators well expreſſed in the margin againſt this Text. Threatning is a dutie which, as occaſion ſerueth, maſters ought to vſe, and that to preuent blowes. But men in authoritie are naturally prone to inſult ouer their inferiours, and to thinke that they cannot ſhew their authoritie but by auſterit ie: for which reaſon the Apoſtle dehorteth husbands from 
                     Col. 3. 19. 
                  bitterneſſe, and parents from 
                     Epheſ. 6. 4. 
                  prouoking their children to wrath. Beſides, the See Treat. 8. §. 14. Gentiles and Heathen thought that they had an abſolute power ouer ſeruants, and that of life and death: whereupon the Roman Emperors made lawes to reſtraine that rigour: for they would vſe their ſeruants like beaſts. Now that Chriſtian maſters ſhould not be of the ſame minde, the Apoſtle exhorteth them to forbeare threatning. Hence note that
               
                  Authoritie muſt be moderated and kept in compaſſe: elſe will 2. Obſer. Authoritie to be kept in compaſſe. it be like a ſwelling riuer without bankes and wals.
               
                  Threatning is here put for all manner of rigor, whether in heart, looke, words, or actions: for it is vſuall in Scripture to put one inſtance for all of the ſame kinde.
               
                  Forbearing, implieth a reſtraint of all manner of exceſſe, as
               1. In time and continuance: when there is nothing but continuall threatning vpon euery ſmall and light occaſion.
               2. In meaſure; when threatning is too fierce, and violent, ſo as it maketh the heart to ſwell againe, and as it were fire to come out of the eies, and thunder out of the mouth, and the body to ſhake in euery part thereof.
               3. In execution; when euery vengeance once threatned ſhall ſurely be put in execution, though the partie that cauſed the threatning be neuer ſo ſorie for his fault, and humble himſelfe, and promiſe amendment, and giue good hope thereof. Woe were it with vs the ſeruants of the high God, if he ſhould ſo deale with vs.
               Here note that men may exceed in doing a bounden dutie: and 3. Obſer. Exceſſe in dutie not good. ſo turne a needfull vertue into an hurtfull vice: great reſpect

therefore muſt be had to the manner of doing good and lawfull things.
               Yet further for the extent of this prohibition, we are to know that vnder the vice forbidden the contrarie vertues are commanded, as mildneſſe, gentleneſſe, patience, long ſuffering, with the like.
            
            
               §. 131. Of maſters ſubiection to a greater maſter.
               
               The latter part of this verſe containeth a reaſon to enforce the directions in the former part. The reaſon in ſumme layeth downe that ſubiection wherein maſters are vnder God. A point whereof none of them could be ignorant, and therefore he thus ſetteth it downe, knowing: for, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
               
               
                  All men know that there is an higher then the higheſt on earth. 
                  4. Obſeru.
                   The light of nature reuealeth as much, no Pagan, much leſſe Chriſtian, can be ignorant thereof. In that ſpeaking to maſters he telleth them that they haue a maſter, thereby he giueth them to vnderſtand, that
               
                  They which are in authoritie, are alſo vnder authoritie: maſters 5. Obſeru. 1 Tim. 6. 15. Gen. 50. 19. haue a maſter. For God is Lord of Lords, Maſter of maſters. In this reſpect ſaith Ioſeph a great Gouernour, am not I vnder God?
               
               Theſe two little particles (euen your, or your alſo) adde ſome 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . emphaſis: hauing reference to ſeruants, as if he had ſaid, as well your maſter, as your ſeruants maſter. Some Greeke copies, for more perſpicuitie, thus read it (both your and their maſter) 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . the ſenſe is all one which way ſoeuer we read it: It ſheweth that in relation to God,
               
                  Maſters and ſeruants are in the ſame ſubiection, and vnder a 6. Obſeru. Matth. 23. 8. & 18. 28. like command. There is one maſter, euen Chriſt: and all men whoſoeuer are brethren, fellow-ſeruants.
               
            
            
               §. 132. Of Gods being in heauen.
               
               That great Maſter, vnder whom all maſters on earth are, is here ſaid to be in heauen, the more to commend and ſet forth his dignitie and authoritie: and to make maſters to ſtand in the more awe of him: To like purpoſe Dauid hauing ſet forth God 
                     Pſal. 2. 4, 10, 11. ſitting in the heauens, inferreth this exhortation vnto the great Commanders on earth, Be wiſe now therefore, ôye Kings, be inſtructed, ye Iudges of the earth: Serue the Lord with feare, and reioyce with trembling.
               
               
                  
                     
                     Object. This placing of God in heauen, maketh ſuch as feare not God the more inſolent and ſecure: for they will be readie to thinke and ſay, How doth God know? can he iudge thorow the 
                     
                        Iob 22. 13, 14. 
                     darke cloud? Thicke clouds are a couering to him that he ſeeth not, and he walketh in the circuit of he auen?
                  
                  
                     Anſw. 1. The Apoſtle wrote to Chriſtian maſters, who thought better of God then ſuch Atheiſts did.
                  2. The placing of God in heauen doth not bound him within the compaſſe thereof: for 1 King. 8. 27. 
                     the heauen, and the heauen of heauens cannot containe him. 
                     
                        Ier. 23. 23. 
                     He filleth heauen and earth. 
                     
                        Matth. 5. 34, 35. 
                     Though heauen be his throne, yet the earth alſo is his footſtoole. But becauſe the Lord doth moſt manifeſt his glorie in heauen, and from heauen, therefore 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     by an excellencie is he ſaid to be in heauen: and that in three eſpeciall reſpects.
                  1. To ſhew that there is no proportion betwixt him and earthly maſters, be they neuer ſo great. For as the heauen is higher then the earth, ſo is God more excellent, yea infinitely more excellent then any man. Who is like vnto the Lord our God 
                     
                        Pſal. 113. 5. 
                     who dwelleth on high? There is no ſuch difference betwixt maſters and ſeruants on earth.
                  2. To ſhew that he hath his eyes continually on all his ſeruants: he ſeeth euerie thing that they doe, as one placed aboue others ſeeth all that are vnder him. 
                        Pſal. 102. 19. 
                     From heauen doth the Lord behold the earth. 
                     
                        & 33. 13. 
                     The Lord looketh from heauen, he beholdeth all the ſonnes of men. 
                     
                        Prou. 15. 3. 
                     The eyes of the Lord are in euerie place, beholding the euill and the good. So as this phraſe noteth the cleane contrarie to that which was before obiected by wicked Atheiſts.
                  
                  3. To ſhew that he is Almightie: able both to recompence his faithfull ſeruants (whereupon Dauid ſaith, Unto thee lift I 
                     
                        Pſal. 123. 1. 
                     vp mine eyes, ô thou that dwelleſt in the heauens) and alſo to execute vengeance on thoſe that are vnfaithfull to God, and cruell to their ſeruants (whereupon ſaith Salomon, if thou ſeeſt oppreſſion 
                     
                        Eccleſ. 5. 8. 
                     &c. maruell not: for he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth.)
                  
                  From this place of God (in heauen) we learne theſe leſſons.
                  1. The eie of faith is needfull to behold God withall, for heauen 7. Obſeru. Heb. 11. 27. is too high for any bodily eie to pierce into. But by Faith did Moſes ſee him who is inuiſible.
                  
                  
                     
2. Though maſters had none on earth aboue them, yet is there 
                     8. Obſeru.
                      
                     one higher then they. There is a maſter in heauen.
                  3. They who cannot be heard on earth, haue yet one to appeale 
                     9. Obſer.
                      
                     vnto. There is a maſter in heauen.
                  4. The command vnder which earthly maſters are, is farre 
                     10. Obſeru.
                      
                     greater then that which they haue: for their commander is in heauen.

                  perſon: it ſignifieth both face and perſon. Now we know that the face of a man is outward, and that which of all other parts maketh him moſt amiable in anothers eie. It is oppoſed to that which is inward, euen the heart: in which reſpect it is ſaid that the Lord ſeeth not as 
                  1 Sam. 16. 7. 
                  man ſeeth, for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart. Here by a Synecdoche, face or perſon is put for euery outward quality, ſtate, or condition which maketh one to be preferred before another in mans approbation, as beautie, comelineſſe, ſtature, wealth, honour, authoritie, and the like. Now in that God receineth not, or reſpecteth not perſons, it ſheweth that God preferreth not any one before another for any the forenamed outward reſpects, or any other like to them. Elihu plainly expoundeth this phraſe in theſe words, he accepteth not the perſon of princes, nor regardeth the 
                  
                     Iob. 34. 19. 
                  rich more then the poore. The phraſe is taken from them that ſit in thrones of iudgement, where their eies ſhould be blinded, that they may not ſee the face or perſon of thoſe that are brought before them: but only heare the cauſe.
               This properly is here noted of God, to meet with a vaine conceit of many maſters, who though they know that God is their maſter as well as their ſeruants maſter, yet thinke that God will not call them ſo ſtraitly to account, but wil ſuffer and tolerate them, becauſe they are of a higher ranke, and in a better condition then ſeruants: But by this phraſe the Apoſtle ſheweth that
               
                  To God all are alike: he putteth no difference betwixt any. 11. Obſer.
                  
                  
He will ſhew fauour to the meaneſt, as well as to the greateſt: he will take vengeance of the greateſt as well as of the meaneſt.
               Many good leſſons may be learned from hence: as among other, theſe,
               1. The pooreſt and meaneſt that be may haue as free acceſſe to God as the wealthieſt and greateſt: and their ſure ſhall be as ſoone receiued.
               2. The great ones on earth, haue as great cauſe to feare the reuenging hand of God for any ſinne, as meane ones.
               3. It becommeth magiſtrates and all in authority to carrie themſelues impartially towards all that are vnder them: for they are in Gods roome. Reſpect of perſons is the cauſe of all that iniuſtice and wrong which magiſtrates doe.
               4. It becommeth miniſters to be faithfull in all Gods houſe, and with an euen hand to ſow the ſeed of Gods word, and to keepe themſelues pure from the bloud of all men: for they are Gods ſtewards and ambaſſadors; and therefore they muſt haue no reſpect of perſons.
            
         
         
            
            
               The ſecond Treatiſe. PART I. Of Husband and Wife, who are ſo to be accounted.
            
            
               §. 1. Of thoſe who may ſeeke to be maried.
               
               
                  HAuing in the former treatiſe laid downe the foundation of all domeſticall duties, by expounding the words of the Apoſtle, I purpoſe now diſtinctly to lay them forth in order: beginning with the firſt and chiefeſt couple in the family, Man and Wife.
               
               Here we are firſt to ſpeake of the perſons who are to be accounted true and lawfull husband and wife: and then of the duties which they owe each to other.
               So as this Treatiſe conſiſteth of two parts.

                     1. The firſt declareth, who are man and wife.
                     2. The ſecond noteth out thoſe common mutuall duties which they owe one to another. Firſt of the firſt.
                  
               
               Husband and wife are they who are rightly ioyned together Who are husband and wife. by the bond of mariage. See Treat. 1. §. 82. & 84. Whereby two are made one fleſh.
               
               For the better cleering of this point, we will conſider both the parties that may be ſo nearely ioyned together, and alſo the manner how they are rightly ioyned in ſo firme an vnity.
               About the parties we are to ſearch,

                     1. Who may ſeeke a mate for mariage.
                     2. What kinde of mate is to be taken.
                  
               
               1. All they who are able without ineuitable danger to their Who may marie. yoake fellow to performe the eſſentiall duties of mariage, may be maried.
               
                  
Out of this propoſition ariſe three queſtions to be diſcuſſed.

                     1. Who are to be accounted able?
                     
                     2. What danger is ineuitable?
                     3. Whether mariage be free for all but ſuch?
                  
               
            
            
               §. 2. Of ripeneſſe of yeares in them that are to be maried.
               
               1. They are to be accounted able who haue

               1. Ripeneſſe of yeares is abſolutely neceſſary for conſummating a iuſt and lawfull mariage: wherefore as God at firſt, made Adam of full age, ſo when he ſought out a wife for him, he made her of full age too: he made her a woman, not a childe. 
                     Gen. 2. 22. 1 Cor. 7. 36. Where the Apoſtle aduiſeth parents to take care for the mariage of their children, he putteth in this prouiſo, if they paſſe the floure of their age. Child-hood is counted the floure of age. While the floure of the plant ſprouteth, the ſeed is greene, vnfit to be ſowen.

                     Salomon was but a childe when he came to the crowne, and yet 2 Chro. 12. 13. he had then a childe of a yeare old at leaſt.
                  
                     Anſw. He was ſaid to be a childe not ſimply, but comparatiuely, 1 King. 2. 22. in relation to his other brothers which were elder then he, & 
                        & 3. 7. in regard of that great worke he was to vndertake. In the time of his reign he is ſaidto be 1 King. 11. 4. 
                     old: which could not be

if he had beene in yeares a childe when he began to reigne: for he reigned but fortie yeares.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. Ahaz was but twentie yeare old when he began to reigne, and reigned but ſixteene yeares, and yet when he died Hezekiah his ſonne was fiue and twentie yeare old, 2 Chro. 28. 1. & 29. 1. by which computation Ahaz had a childe when he was but eleuen, or twelue yeare old at moſt.
                  1. Anſw. Some ſay that this was extraordinary, and render this reaſon, Ahaz ſo young a father as Elizabet an old mother,

                  2. Anſw. The beginning of that reigne when Ahaz was but twentie yeare old, is to be referred to Iotham his father; for Ahaz was twentie yeare old when he (namely Iotham) began to reigne: as 2 Chro. 36. 9. 
                     Iehoiachin was eight yeare old, when he (namely his father Iehoiachim) began to reigne: for Iehoiachin was 2 King. 24. 8. eighteene, when he himſelfe began to reigne.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Iotham was but 2 Chro. 27. 1. twentie and fiue yeare old when he began to reigne, how then could Ahaz his ſonne at that time be twentie?
                  
                     Anſw. Iotham was fiue and twentie yeare old when his father Vzziah was ſtrucke with leproſie, from which time he 2 Chro. 26. 21. reigned as King euen in his fathers life time. But after his father was dead, the kingdome was eſtabliſhed to him alone Parents ſinne in marying children vnder age. after a more ſolemne manner; in which reſpect it is ſaid that then he began to reigne: and then was his ſonne Ahaz twentie yeare old, Iotham himſelfe being about fortie.
                  Contrarie to the forenamed fitneſſe of age is the practiſe of 
                        Puella dum ei aetas matura non eſt, nulli dari vel promitti debet. Aug. epiſt. 233. Matrimonium contractum verum non eſt ſi impubes fuerit qui contraxit. Azpilcuet. Conſil. & reſp. l. 4. de ſponſ. Conſ. 8. ſuch parents, or other friends of children, as make matches for them in their child-hood, and moue them to conſent, and ſo cauſe them to be maried: ſuch mariages are mock-mariages, and meere nullities. For children cannot know what appertaineth to mariage, much leſſe can they performe that which is required of maried perſons: their conſent therefore is iuſtly accounted no conſent, vnleſſe they doe ratifie it after they come to yeares.
               
            
            
               §. 3. Of impotent perſons that ought not to ſeeke after mariage.
               
               2. They are to be accounted impotent, and in that reſpect

vnable to performe the eſſentiall duties of mariage, who (to vſe the Scripture phraſe) were borne Eunuchs from their mothers 
                  
                     Mat. 19. 12. 
                  wombe: or by any accidentall occaſion are ſo made: as they who are defectiue, or cloſed in their ſecret parts: or taken with an incurable palſie: or poſſeſſed with frigidity, or any other ſuch like impediment.
               Theſe ought not to ſeeke after mariage: for by thoſe ſignes of impotencie God ſheweth that he calleth them to liue ſingle.
               Contrarie to this manifeſtation of Gods will doe they ſinne, A ſinne to conceale any impotencie. who conceale their impotencie and ioyne themſelues in marriage, whereby they fruſtrate one maine end of mariage, which is procreation of children; and doe that wrong to the partie whom they marie, as ſufficient ſatisfaction can neuer be made.
            
            
               §. 4. Of barrenneſſe, that it hindereth not mariage.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. Are ſuch as are barren to be ranked among thoſe impotent perſons?
                  
                     Anſw. No, there is great difference betwixt impotencie and barrenneſſe.
                  1. Impotencie may by outward ſenſible ſignes be knowne 
                        Sterilem coniugem fas non eſt relinquere. Aug. de Nup. lib. 1. cap. 10. and diſcerned, barrenneſſe cannot: it is not diſcerned but by want of child-bearing.
                  2. Impotent perſons cannot yeeld due beneuolence: but ſuch as are barren may.
                  3. Impotencie is incurable: but barrenneſſe is not ſimply ſo. Many after they haue beene a long while barren haue become fruitfull: and that not only by an extraordinary worke of God aboue the courſe of nature (as 
                        Gen. 18. 11. 
                     Sarah and 
                        Luk. 1. 7. 
                     Elizabeth, with whom by reaſon of age it ceaſed to be after the manner of women) but alſo by ſuch a bleſſing as might ſtand with the courſe of nature, being obtained by praier (as 
                        Gen. 25. 21. 
                     Rebeckah and 1 Sam. 1. 5, 20. 
                     Annah) whereof daily experience giueth good euidence: for many after 10, 15, 20, and more yeares barrenneſſe haue brought forth children.
                  On theſe grounds many Saints, who haue beene barren, haue maried, and their practiſe therein not diſallowed, nor their mariage diſſolued. 
                        Tantum valet ſociale vinculū coniugum, vt cùm cauſa procreandi colligitur, nec ipſa cauſa procreandi ſoluetur. Aug. de bon. Coniug. cap. 7. For though procreation of children

be one end of mariage, yet is it not the only end: and ſo inuiolable is the mariage bond, that though it be made for childrens ſake, yet for want of children it may not be broken.
               
            
            
               §. 5. Of that ineuitable danger which hindereth mariage.
               
               3. They who are infected with ſuch contagious diſeaſes, as diffuſe themſelues into thoſe who haue ſocietie with them, and infect them alſo, ought not to ſeeke after mariage: for that cannot but turne to the danger of the partie with whom they marie. It was for mutuall good one of another 
                     Gen. 2. 18. that God ordained the law of mariage; to vſe it to the hurt and danger of one another, is againſt the maine end of the firſt inſtitution.
               The law of ſhutting vp a leper from all ſocietie with men proueth as much; for if lepers might not haue mutuall ſociety 2 Chro. 26. 21. with any man, much leſſe might they haue matrimoniall ſocietie with a wife or an husband.
               By contagious diſeaſes not only both the parties which company together will be infected, but alſo their iſſue: whereby their diſeaſe which otherwiſe might die with themſelues, is propagated to their poſterity. A like reſtraint may be applied to ſuch foule and loathſome diſeaſes, as make the company and ſociety of that perſon, who is infected therewith, irkcſome, and odious to their companion.
               Contrarie to the end and vſe of mariage doe they ſinne, A ſinne to conceale a contagious diſeaſe. who conceale ſuch diſeaſes, and ſo ioyne themſelues in mariage, to the vnanſwerable preiudice of the partie whom they marrie.
            
            
               §. 6. Of the lawfulneſſe of mariage to all ſorts of perſons.
               
               Where there is no ſuch iuſt impediment as hath beene before mentioned, it is lawfull for all ſorts of people of what 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . calling or condition ſoeuer to marrie. For Mariage is honourable 
                  
                     Heb. 13. 4. 
                  in all, or among all, namely in, or among all ſorts of people: whereupon it is accounted a Doctrine of deuils to forbid 
                  1 Tim. 4. 1, 3. 
                  to marrie. For it is a Doctrine contrarie to Gods word, and a Doctrine that cauſeth much inward burning, and outward pollution, and ſo maketh their bodies, which ſhould be temples of the holy Ghoſt, to be ſties of the deuils.
               The diſeaſe, for the redreſſing whereof mariage is ſanctified,

is a common diſeaſe which hath infected all ſorts of people: why then ſhall not the remedy be as common?
               In this caſe the Apoſtle ſaith indefinitly of all, without exception of any, to auoid fornication let euery man haue his owne 
                  1 Cor. 7. 2, 9. 
                  wife, and let euerie woman haue her owne husband. And againe, If they cannot containe let them marie: for it is better to marie then to burne.

                  Anſw. That is ſpoken of ſome particular perſons to whom the gift of continency was giuen: not of any diſtinct conditions, and callings, as if all and euerie one of this or that calling had ſo done or were able ſo to doe: whereupon Chriſt addeth this clauſe, He that is able to receiue it, let him receiue it, and the Apoſtle to the ſame purpoſe ſaith, 1 Cor. 7. 7. 
                  euery one hath his proper gift of God.
               
               Contrarie to this neceſſarie and warrantable libertie, is the impure and tyrannicall reſtraint of the Church of Rome, whereby all that enter into any of their holy orders, are kept from mariage.

               They who haue power to marie muſt be carefull in chuſing an helpe meet for them: for 
                     Gen. 2. 18. Neceſſarie for the eſſence of mariage. this was Gods care when firſt he inſtituted mariage. To make an helpe meet for mariage, ſome things are abſolutely neceſſary for the very eſſence or being of mariage; others, neceſſarie for the comfort and happineſſe of mariage.
               In regard of the former ſort, there muſt be choſen,
               1. One of the ſame kinde or nature: for among all the creatures which were made, 
                     Gen. 2. 20. Buggerie. 
                  there was not found an helpe meet for man: therefore God out of his bone and fleſh made a woman of his 1. Perſons of the ſame kind. owne nature and kinde.
               Contrarie to this is the deteſtable ſinne of buggerie with beaſts, expreſly forbidden by the 
                     Leu. 18. 23. law. A ſinne more then beaſtly: for the bruit beaſts content themſelues with their owne kinde: Monſtrous it is in the kinde thereof: and a cauſe of abominable monſters. 
                     Vide Aug. de Ciuit. Dei lib. 15. cap. 23. & Lud. Uivem in eundem de Incubis, & Succubis.
                   Contrary alſo is that copulation which witches haue with deuils: then which none more vnnaturall, none more prodigious and odious.
               2. One of the contrarie ſex: the male muſt chooſe a female: the female a male. Thus God hauing made Adam a male, 2. Perſons of diuers ſexes. Maritalis copula requirit ſexuum aptitudinem. Bern. in Cant. ſerm. 66. Vnnaturall commixtions. Rom. 1. 25, 26. made Eue a female, and ioyned them in mariage. A coniunction of theſe different ſexes is only fit for increaſe of mankinde, and other mariage duties.
               Contrarie are thoſe vnnaturall commixtions of parties of the ſame ſex: which the Apoſtlereckoneth vp as iudgements inflicted on the heathen, becauſe they changed the truth of God into a lie, and worſhipped, and ſerued the creature more then the Creator.
               
               3. One beyond thoſe degrees of conſanguinitie and affinitie which 
                  Perſons without the degrees of conſanguinity. 
                  are forbidden by the law of God: theſe degrees are expreſſed by Moſes Leuit. 18. 6, 7, &c. and explained in a table of the degrees

of conſanguinitie and affinitie within which none may mary, appointed to be hung vp in euery Church.
               Contrary is inceſt, a ſinne not only forbidden by Gods Inceſt. O mulieris ſcelus incredibile, & praeter hanc vnam in omni vita inauditū. O libidinem effrenatam & indomitam! O audaciam, ſingularem! Non timuiſſe vim deorum, hominumque famam? Vicit pudorem libido, timorem audacia, rationem amentia. Cic. pro. A. Cluent.
                   word, but ſo horrible euen to the heathen as (to vſe the Apoſtles words, 1 Cor. 5. 1.) it is not ſo much as named among the Gentiles. Excellently is that cenſure verified by the heathen Orators patheticall exclamation againſt one Saſſia who maried her ſonne in law, in theſe words: O incredible wickedneſſe of a woman, not heard of in any age but this! O vnbridled and vntamed luſt! O ſingular boldneſſe! Not to feare the power of God, and fame of men! &c. Luſt, impudencie, madneſſe, ouercame ſhame, feare, and reaſon.
               
               What may we now thinke of the diſpenſations which the Pope giueth for inceſtuous mariages, allowed vnto great Princes euen by the §. 24. cap. 5. Tridentine councell? doth he not herein ſhew himſelfe to be that man of ſinne, who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelfe aboue all that is called God?
               
               4. One that is free: nor maried, nor betrothed to another: the law of mariage noteth thus much in this clauſe, 
                     Mat. 19. 5. 
                  They two ſhall be one fleſh. And in that 
                     Deut. 22. 22, 23, 24. the law inflicteth the ſame puniſhment 2 Theſ. 2. 3, 4. 4. Perſons that are free. vpon the perſon which being betrothed committeth vncleanneſſe, that it doth vpon a maried perſon, it is euident that it is vnlawfull to marie one betrothed to another, as well as one maried to another. So firme is a contract, as the law calleth a betrothed maid, a wife: and a betrothed maid might not be put away without a bill of diuorce.
               Contrary is Bigamy, and Polygamy, whereof 
                     Treat. 1. §. 83. before: vnto which head may be referred mariages with ſuch as haue beene eſpouſed to others before. Theſe are vtterly vnlawfull.
            
            
               §. 8. Of the lawfulneſſe of other mariages after one of the maried couple is dead.
               
               
                  1. Queſt. Are they who haue buried their husband or wife ſo free, as they may marie againe?
                  
                     Anſw. Yea, as free as they who were neuer before maried. The law doth not only permit a widow to marie againe: but 
                        Deut. 25. 5, 9. if her husband died before he had any children, it commanded the next kinſman that was liuing and free to marie her, that he might raiſe vp ſeed to his brother deceaſed: which if

he refuſed to doe, a penalty of ignominy was inflicted on him: the widow reiected was to looſe his ſhooe from his foot, 
                     
                        Non concederet hoc Paulus niſi liceret. At parum dico concedit: vult quo

                           . Volo, inquit, adoleſcentiores nubere: nec dubium quin viduas dicat. Bern. ſerm. 66. in Cant.
                      
                     and to ſpit in his face in the preſence of the Elders. The Apoſtle expreſly ſaith that a woman, when her husband is dead, is at liberty to be maried (1. Cor. 7. 39.) yea ſpeaking of young widowes he further ſaith, I will that they marie (1. Tim. 5. 14.) This libertie which the Prophet of God, and Apoſtle of Chriſt grant to a wife, can by no ſhew of reaſon be denied to an huſband: for the bond of mariage giueth them a like power ouer one anothers body, (1 Cor. 7. 4.) and knitteth one as inuiolably as the other, (Mat. 19. 6.) Husbands therefore as well as wiues haue vſed this libertie, as Abraham (Gen. 25. 1.) 
                        Rom. 7. 2. The Apoſtle that giueth this libertie, rendreth a reaſon thereof, taken from the limitation of that time wherein maried perſons haue power one ouer another, and that is the time of this life only: For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband, ſo long as he liueth: but if the husband be dead ſhe is looſed, &c. On this ground all the §. 24. Quid largam benedictionem nuptiarum reſtringis? Bern. loc.

                  2. Queſt. May this libertie be extended any further then to a ſecond mariage?
                  
                     Anſw. We finde no reſtraint from a third, or fourth, or more mariages, if by the diuine prouidence ſo many wiues, or huſbands one after another be taken away while there is need for the ſuruiuing partie to vſe the benefit of mariage. The woman of Samaria that had fiue husbands one after another, is not blamed for being maried to ſo many, but for liuing with one (after the other were dead) that was not her husband, (Ioh. 4. 18 Neither did the Lord condemne that woman which was ſaid to haue ſeuen husbands one after another, (Mat. 22. 25, &c.)
                  Contrarie is the opinion of 
                        Secundas nuptias pro fornicationibus habent. Aug. de haer. §. 26. Montaniſts, and Cataphryges, ancient heretiques that accounted thoſe mariages which the ſuruiuor made after the death of a yoke-fellow, to be adulterous: with which hereſie

                     Tertullian an ancient and learned father was ſo farre infected, as he wrote a treatiſe in defence thereof. It ſeemeth by their arguments that one maine ground

of their error was a miſinterpretation of thoſe Scriptures which forbid men to haue two wiues at once, and women to haue two husbands at once, as, Two ſhall be one fleſh, Gen. 2. 24. A Biſhop and a Deacon muſt be the husband of one wife, 1 Tim. 2. 2, 10. Let a widow be taken that hath beene the wife of one husband, 1 Tim. 5. 9. Theſe are indeed expreſſe texts againſt ſuch Digamiſts, and Polygamiſts as haue beene deſcribed Treat. 1 §. 83 before: but they make no more againſt ſecond or other after-mariages one mate being dead, then againſt firſt mariages. Into the roll of theſe heretiques may they be put, who denie ſuch after mariages to any kinde of Miniſters. So doe our aduerſaries: they 
                        Miniſterijs minorum ordinum exercendis ſuffici poſſunt coniugati, dummodo non bigami. Concil. Trid. §. 23. c. 17. Vide Bellarm. de Cler. l. 1. c. 23. exclude ſuch as are maried againe after one wife is dead from ſuch functions of inferiour orders, as they admit thoſe who are but once maried vnto. They alleage many of thoſe Scriptures which Montaniſts doe (as 1 Tim. 2. 2, 10. and 5. 9) which ſheweth that they are infected with the ſame hereſie, though they pretend to renounce it.
               
            
            
               §. 9. Of equalitie in yeeres betwixt husband and wife.
               
               That matrimoniall ſocietie may proue comfortable, it is requiſite 
                     Acqualē ducito Pittaci dictum. Sivis nubere, nube pari. Ouid. 1. Equalitie in age. that there ſhould be ſome equalitie betwixt the parties that are maried in Age, Eſtate, Condition, Pietie.
               
               1. For Age, as the partie that ſeeketh a mate muſt be of ripe yeeres, fit to giue conſent, and able to performe mariage duties, ſo the mate which is taken muſt be ſomewhat anſwerable 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Ariſt. Eth. l. 8. c. 12. Luk. 1. 7. in age: if one young, both young: if one of middle age, both ſo: if one growne to yeeres, the other alſo. It is noted of Zacharie and Elizabeth, that both were well ſtriken in yeeres. If both were old together, then both alſo were young together. Equalitie in yeeres maketh maried perſons more fit for procreation of children, for a mutuall performance of mariage duties each to other, and for making their companie and ſocietie euery way more happie.
               This equalitie is not ouer ſtrictly to be taken, as if the maried couple were to be iuſt of the ſame age, but only for ſome anſwerableneſſe in yeeres: which may be though there be a diſparitie Moſt meet that husbands be elder then wiues. of fiue or ten, or ſomewhat more yeeres: eſpecially if the exceſſe of yeeres be on the husbands part: for beſides that according to the ordinarie courſe of nature a mans ſtrength

and vigour laſteth longer then a womans, it is very meet that the husband ſhould be ſome what elder then his wife, becauſe he is an head, a gouernour, a protector of his wife. The Scripture noteth many husbands to be elder then their wiues (as Abraham was tenne yeeres elder then Sarah; and if we 
                     Gen. 17. 17. narrowly marke the circumſtances of the hiſtories of Iſaac and Iacob, and their wiues, we ſhall finde that the husbands were elder then their wiues) To my remembrance an approued example of an husband younger then his wife cannot be giuen out of Scripture.
               Contrary to this equalitie in yeeres, is the practiſe of many Vnmeet for aged perſons to mary young ones. men and women, who being aged, to ſatisfie their luſt, or for ſome other by-reſpect, mary ſuch as are but in the floure of their age, wherein they doe many times much faile of their expectation: for thoſe young ones finding the ſocietie of aged folkes to be burdenſome, and irkſome vnto them, ſoone begin to loath the ſame, and thereby cauſe more griefe and vexation, then euer they did giue comfort and contentment.
               On the other ſide, others there be who in the prime and Vnmeet for young perſons to mary aged. ſtrength of their age, for wealth, honour, or ſuch like reſpects, mary thoſe that with age begin to be decrepit, and vnfit to be maried, hoping that they will not long liue, but that with a little trouble they ſhall purchaſe much dignitie or riches, & after a while be free againe. But God oft meeteth with ſuch in their kinde, by prolonging the life of thoſe aged perſons, and ſo making the burden to be much more grieuous and tedious then was imagined, and by taking away thoſe young ones ſooner then they looked for, whereby it commeth to paſſe that all their hopes periſh.

                  nſult ouer the other more then is meet: for if a man of great wealth be maried to a poore woman, he will thinke to make

her as his maid-ſeruant, and expect that ſhe ſhould carrie her ſelfe towards him ſo as beſeemeth not a yoake-fellow, and a bedfellow: ſo as ſuch an one may rather be ſaid to be brought vnto bondage, then mariage. And if a rich woman mary a poore man, ſhe will looke to be the maſter, and to rule him: ſo as the order which God hath eſtabliſhed will be cleane peruerted: and the honour of mariage laid in the duſt. For where no order is, there can be no honour.
               3. The like may be ſaid of outward condition, that therein 3. Equalitie in condition. Eas vxores quas inferioris gradus homines ducant, hi qui altioris dignitatis ſunt ducere legibus propter dignitatem prohibentur.
                   alſo there be ſome equalitie: that Princes, Nobles, and Gentlemen, mary ſuch as are of their owne ranke: and the meaner ſort ſuch as are of their degree. Note what ſort of wiues Abraham, Iſaac, and Iaacob maried, and it will appeare that they had reſpect to this paritie. Diſparitie in condition as well as in eſtate, is a meanes to make men and women ſwell and inſult aboue that which is meet: yea and to twit one another in the teeth with their former eſtate and condition.
               Contrary on the one ſide are the practiſes of ſuch as affect 
                     Digeſt. lib. 23. cap. 2. §. 49. A fault to affect to mary a perſon much aboue ones ranke. Qui longè praeſtantiores ſe ducunt, non coniugum viri, ſed ſerui fiunt dotiū. Plut. de Inſtit. liber. Pro. 14. 1. and 12. 4. to mary aboue their owne eſtate and degree: thinking by ſuch mariages to aduance themſelues. This is the only thing which many ſeeke after in ſeeking wiues and husbands; whereby it commeth to paſſe that they oft meet with the worſt matches, and make their mariage a kinde of bondage vnto them. Great portions make many women proud, daintie, lauiſh, idle, and careleſſe; a man were much better, euen for helpe of his outward eſtate, to mary a prudent, ſober, thriftie, carefull, diligent wife, though with a ſmall portion, then ſuch an one. A proud backe, a daintie tooth, and a lauiſh hand will ſoone conſume a great portion; but a wiſe woman buildeth her houſe: and a vertuous woman is a crowne to her husband. Many wiues alſo that are maried to very rich husbands, are more ſtinted and pinched in their allowance, then ſuch as are maried to men of meaner eſtate. It is not the meanes which a man hath, but his minde and diſpoſition that maketh him free and bountifull to his wife.
               Contrarie are the mariages which men of great authoritie A fault to mary a perſon much vnder ones ranke. and abilitie make with meane women, yea their owne maids many times, and thoſe of the loweſt ranke, their kitchinmaids.

parties part that is to be maried: and then if that partie be vnder the gouernment of parents, the matter muſt be moued to them, before there be any further proceeding therein, as Sampſon who ſeeing and liking a daughter of the Philiſtims, 
                     Judg. 14. 2. told his father and his mother thereof. Yea though the partie be not vnder the gouernment of any, yet it is very meet that counſell be taken of wiſe and vnderſtanding friends: that in a matter ſo weightie as mariage is, there may be the aduice of more heads then one, for the preuenting of ſuch miſchiefes as through raſhneſſe might fall out. After a liking is thus taken by one partie of a meet mate, that liking muſt be moued to the other partie ſo liked, to know whether there be a reciprocall affection of one towards another. Thus Sampſon went and 
                     Iudg. 14. 7. talked with that woman whom he liked to be his wife. If at firſt there be a good liking mutually and thorowly ſetled in both their hearts of one another, loue is like to continue in them for euer, as things which are well glued, and ſetled before they be ſhaken vp and downe, will neuer be ſeuered aſunder: but if they be ioyned together without glue, or ſhaken while the glue is moiſt, they cannot remaine firme.
               Mutuall loue and good liking of each other is as glue.
               Let the parties to be maried be herein well ſetled before they come to meet with trials through cohabitation, and that loue will not eaſily be looſened by any trials.
               Contrarie is the adulterous and brutiſh practiſe of ſuch as Too eager and haſty purſuing after mariage, a brutiſh thing. ſo ſoone as they caſt their eie on any whom they like, neuer aduiſe or conſult about a right and due proceeding vnto mariage, but inſtantly with all the eagerneſſe and ſpeed they can, like brute beaſts, ſeeke to haue their deſire and luſt ſatisfied. Though to keepe themſelues free from the penalty of the lawes vnder which they liue, they procure meanes to be maried, yet they declare a luſtfull and adulterous minde. And their practiſe is too like to the practiſe of the Beniamits, who catcht wiues from among the daughters of Shiloh as they were dancing: or elſe to the practiſe of the old world, which ſo grieued the Spirit of God, that it repented him that he had 
                     Iudg. 21. 23. made man, and thereupon he was moued to bring a generall deluge on the whole world. Their practiſe was this, that they
                  
                  tooke them wiues of all that they choſe: that is, they raſhly and 
                     Gen. 6. 2. ſuddenly maried whomſoeuer they liked, without any conſideration of their condition.

This rightly made is a contract, which is the beginning of a mariage.
               The right making of a firme contract conſiſteth in two things:
               1. In an actuall taking of each other for eſpouſed man and wife.
               2. In a direct promiſe of marying each other within a conuenient time. So as a forme of contract may be made to this purpoſe; Firſt the man taking the woman by the hand to ſay, I A. take thee B. to my eſpouſed wife, and doe faithfully promiſe to marie thee in time meet and conuenient. And then the woman againe taking the man by the hand to ſay, I B. take thee A. to my eſpouſed husband, and doe faithfully promiſe to yeeld to be maried to thee in time meet and conuenient. This mutuall and actuall taking of one another for eſpouſed man and wife in the time preſent, and a direct promiſe of marying one another afterwards, ſetleth ſuch a right and property of the one in the other as cannot be alienated without licence had from the great Iudge of heauen, who hath by his diuine ordinance ſetled that right.

Hom. 43. in all ages, yet I dare not pronounce it to be ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as the want thereof ſhould nullifie a mariage, and make it to be no lawfull mariage. But ſurely it is ſo meet and requiſite, as I would aduiſe all Chriſtians that deſire a bleſſing and good ſucceſſe on their mariage to be contracted before they are maried.
                  
                     
If there were no other ground for it but this, that God hath ſanctified it, and commended it vnto vs by his word, it were enough to perſwade ſuch as feare God to vſe it.
                  For I demand, why doth God commend vnto his Church any thing by his word, but that his Church ſhould make conſcience of vſing it? Now that by Gods word it is commended, is without contradiction moſt euident. For, not to inſiſt on that argument which, not without good probability, is alleaged for the antiquity of a contract, and thus collected from Gods ordering of that firſt ancient mariage betwixt Adam and 
                        Gen. 2. 22. 
                     Euah, God brought Euah to Adam on the firſt day that they were created to ſee how he would like her, and vpon the ſight of her, and notice which withall he had of her, by that wiſdome which God gaue him, he then tooke her to himſelfe: which taking is ſuppoſed to be but a contract, becauſe 
                        Gen. 4. 1. he did not know her till after his fall. If it be obiected that Adam and Euah are called 
                        Gen. 2. 25. 
                     man and wife in the time of their innocencie. It may bee anſwered that thoſe titles 
                        Deut. 22. 24. Gen. 19. 14. Conſuetudine Scripturarum ſponſi viri, & ſponſae vocantur vxores. Hier. in Mat. 1. are in Scripture giuen to ſuch as are only contracted, to ſhew the neere and firme coniunction betwixt parties eſpouſed.
                  But not to inſiſt on that which is but probable, it is more then probable that Lots daughters were contracted: for it is ſaid that 
                        Gen. 19. 14, 8. Quia iam deſponſatio facta erat, ideo vocat eos generos. Chryſ. in hunc loc.
                      
                     Lot had ſonnes in law which maried (or rather ſhould marie) his daughters: and withall it is ſaid that they had not knowne man: now then it muſt needs follow that they were called Lots ſonnes in law becauſe his daughters were eſpouſed to them. But moſt euident for this purpoſe is that difference which the 
                        Deut. 22. 22, &c.
                      law putteth betwixt a pure virgin, an eſpouſed maid, and a maried wife. So as contracted perſons are in a middle degree betwixt ſingle perſons, and maried perſons: they are neither ſimply ſingle, nor actually maried. To ſhew that this cuſtome of a contract before mariage continued in Gods Church among the Saints, it is expreſly noted that Marie the mother of the Lord 
                        Luk. 1. 27. Ieſus who liued many hundred yeares after that law, was contracted.
               
            
            
               
               §. 16. Of the reaſons which ſhew how requiſite a contract is.
               
               Many good and weightie reaſons may be alledged to ſhew how requiſite it is that a contract ſhould go before mariage. For
               1. It addeth much to the honour of mariage, that it ſhould be deliberatly and aduiſedly ſtep after ſtep, by one degree after another conſummated and made vp.
               2. It putteth a difference betwixt ſuch as intend mariage in the feare of the Lord, for ſuch holy ends as are warranted in the word, and ſuch as intend it only to ſatisfie their luſt, or for other like carnall ends. For theſe can admit no delay, as was noted In the end of §. 13. before. But they that vſe this ſolemne preparation by a contract before mariage, ſhew that they deſire to haue all things fit for ſo ſacred a matter duly performed; and therefore they are content to make ſome ſtay for the better effecting thereof.
               3. It is a meanes of knitting the hearts of the two parties to be maried more firmely and inuiolably together before they come to dwell together. For a contract being the beginning of a mariage, it is an euident demonſtration of Gods counſell concerning the parties contracted, that God hath prepared them each for other to be man and wife: ſo as after the contract is made, they may ſimply and abſolutely pray each for other, that God would bleſſe them one to another, to liue comfortably and happily together. Before a contract is made, they can but vpon ſuppoſition (if God haue appointed them to be man and wife) pray one for another. For oft it falleth out that after many great hopes and likelihoods of proceeding in ſuch or ſuch a match, by ſome occaſion or other it is cleane broken off: but a lawfull contract knitteth ſo firme a knot as cannot be broken: ſo as a man may conclude that being contracted to a woman ſhe ſhall be his wife: and ſo may a woman conclude of a man. The conſideration hereof will further moue them more narrowly to obſerue what good qualities, or what other things, which may make them more louely one to another, are in each other.
               4. It is a meanes to make them before hand prepare themſelues to perfome ſuch mariage duties as Gods word requireth of man and wife. For a contract giueth them aſſurance of

mariage if they liue vnto it: ſo as then they cannot but know that it is high time for them to thinke how they are to carrie themſelues, when they come to liue in houſe together: and withall to conſider, what croſſes ordinarily doe accompanie the maried eſtate, that they may be before hand prepared wiſely to paſſe them ouer, or patiently to vndergoe them.
               5. It may be a meanes of diſcouering many hidden and cloſe inconueniences, which otherwiſe would neuer come to light. For many friends fearing leſt the diſcouering of ſome euils which are carried cloſely, ſhould make a breach betwixt themſelues and their friends, will not make them knowne till they ſee ſome vrgent neceſſitie to moue them ſo to doe. Though the euill be ſuch, as being knowne would hinder mariage, yet till they ſee ſome ſure euidence, that they ſhall indeed be maried (if no iuſt exception be put in) they will hope that ſome other occaſion may fall out to hinder the mariage, and in that reſpect conceale their exception. But becauſe a contract is the beginning of mariage, after they haue notice therof, they will not forbeare to diſcloſe what they know. For this end is it, that the contract is three ſeuerall times openly publiſhed in the Church, that if any doe know any iuſt cauſe why ſuch perſons as are contracted may not lawfully proceed to mariage, they make knowne the ſame. A commendable cuſtome: and great pitty, that it is ſo much neglected as it is.
               6. It may preuent many plots and practiſes of inueigling, or ſtealing away maids and widowes. For it oft falleth out, that when parents or other friends haue prouided a good match for their daughter, or for ſome other vnder their gouernment, and all things on all parts well concluded, the wedding day appointed, and all things fitted and prepared for the ſolemnizing of the wedding, ſome deſirous to foreſtall that mariage, by ſecret and cunning deuices get the bride away a few daies before, if not on the very morning of the intended wedding day, and mary her out of hand to another. That which maketh men ſo bold is, that they know a clandeſtine mariage being conſummate ſhall ſtand firme in law. But a legall contract preuenteth ſuch miſchiefes, becauſe it maketh ſuch a furtiue mariage vtterly void. None therfore knowing

that a contract is lawfully made before hand, will be ſo bold, or rather ſo mad, as to offer to fruſtrate a mariage after any ſuch manner.
               7. It is a meanes to ſtirre vp the parties which are to be maried, more carefully and diligently to prouide all things fit for their dwelling together, and well ordering their houſhold before hand; that they be not to ſeeke for neceſſaries when they ſhould vſe them. For being contracted, they know that it cannot be long ere they muſt come to dwell together.
            
            
               §. 17. Of abuſing, or neglecting a contract.
               
               There are two extremes contrarie to the forenamed doctrine of a contract. One of attributing too much to it: another of derogating too much from it. Many make it a very mariage, and thereupon haue a greater ſolemnitie at their contract, then Nonnullis ſponſis tam impotens eſt ardor libidinis, vt corpuſculo puellari vim adferant. Eraſ. in Inſt. Matr. at their mariage: yea many take libertie after a contract to know their ſpouſe, as if they were maried: an unwarrantable and diſhoneſt practiſe. Lots daughters were See §. 15. contracted to husbands, and yet they are ſaid to haue knowne no man. The law ſtileth her that is contracted 
                     Deut. 22. 24. 
                  a maid, to ſhew that ſhe ought to keepe her ſelfe a virgin till the mariage be conſummate. Therefore Mary is thus deſcribed, 
                     Luk. 1. 27. 
                  a virgin eſpouſed. But it is the common courſe of moſt to make light account of this warrantable and honourable proceeding to mariage by a contract. Few there be in compariſon of the multitudes that are maried, who make any conſcience thereof. They thinke it needleſſe, and vtterly neglect it. No maruell that they meet with many miſchiefes and inconueniences, when the meanes of preuenting the ſame are not vſed. Let ſuch duly weight the reaſons rendred in the former ſection.
            
            
               §. 18. Of the diſtance of time betwixt the contract and mariage.
               
               
                  
                     Quest. What diſtance of time muſt paſſe betwixt the making of a contract, and conſummating of mariage?
                  
                     Anſw. This muſt be left to the wiſe conſideration of the parties contracted, and of their friends, for the ſame time cannot preciſely be preſcribed to all. Occaſions may fall out either of haſtening, or putting off the mariage. Only extremes on both ſides muſt be auoided. Neither ought the mariage be

too ſuddenly ſolemnized vpon the contract: (then the ends and reaſons of a contract, before mentioned, are made void) nor yet too long put off (then may Satan take occaſion to tempt them for their incontinencie.) The laudable cuſtome of our and other Churches ſheweth, that at leaſt three weekes muſt paſſe betwixt contract and mariage. For the contract is 
                        Rubr. before the forme of ſolemnizing of matrimony. to be three times publiſhed, and that but once a weeke before the wedding be celebrated. And we read that the virgin Mary was at leaſt three moneths contracted before Ioſeph tooke her to wife. For when the Angell firſt came to her ſhe was 
                        Luk. 1. 27. 56. eſpouſed: after that ſhe went to her coſen Elizabeth, with whom ſhe abode three moneths: and then being returned home Ioſeph was warned by an Angell to take her to wife. I 
                        Mat. 1. 20. note not this as a rule for euery one preciſely to follow. For the virgin Mary had a iuſt occaſion to tarrie three moneths with her old coſen Elizabeth: and ſo may others haue occaſions to put off their mariages: which may be lawfull, ſo the mariage be not put off too long, and that there be a mutuall and ioynt conſent of both parties. For after the contract is made, neither the man nor the woman haue the power of their owne body.
                  Contrary is that vnwarrantable courſe which many take, to Vnlawfull for parties contracted long to abſent themſelues each from other. Deut. 24. 5. be affianced and made ſure to a wife, and then to trauell beyond ſea, or to any other place, and be abſent from their ſpouſe a yeere, or two, or three, or it may be more yeeres. If a man might not goe to warre, nor be charged with any buſineſſe that ſhould draw him from his wife the firſt yeere of his mariage, much leſſe may he abſent himſelfe for any long time after he is contracted but not maried. This may be a meanes to alienate the heart of his ſpouſe from him for euer.
               
            
            
               §. 19. Of a religious conſecrating of mariage.
               
               III. The laſt degree of conſummating a mariage, is the open and publike ſolemnization thereof: which conſiſteth
               
                  
                     
                        1. In a religious conſecration
                        
                        thereof.
                     
                     
                        2. In a ciuill celebration
                        
                         
                     
                  
               
               A religious conſecration of mariage is performed by the bleſſing of a publike Miniſter of the word in the open face of the Church in the day time. This of old hath beene vſed of

Chriſtians, and ſtill is continued among vs. Though we haue neither expreſſe precept, nor particular patterne in Gods word for this manner of ſolemnizing a mariage (for there is no particular forme thereof ſet downe in the Scripture) yet it being agreeable to the generall rules thereof, we ought in conſcience to ſubiect our ſelues thereto.
               The generall rules are theſe, Let all things be done decently, 
                  1 Cor. 14. 40. 
                  and in order. The Churches of God haue ſuch a cuſtome. Submit 
                  1 Cor. 11. 16. 
                  your ſelues to euery ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, with 1 Pet. 2. 13. the like. But the foreſaid manner of conſecrating mariage, is very decent and in good order, a laudable cuſtome of the Churches, and an ordinance of thoſe gouernours vnder whom we liue. Therefore warrantable, and to be obſerued. Neither is this order, cuſtome, and ordinance appointed without iuſt and weightie reaſons. For
               1. Mariage is a kind of publike action: the well or ill ordering therof much tendeth to the good or hurt of family, Church, and common-wealth. For by mariage families are erected, and Church and common-wealth increaſed and continued.
               2. 
                     Heb. 13 4. 
                  Mariage is honourable.

                   The moſt ſacred and inuiolable bond that knitteth any two perſons together.
               3. Mariage is 
                     Prou. 2. 17. Gods couenant, wherein he himſelfe hath a maine and principall ſtroke. For God is the chiefeſt agent in ioyning man and woman in mariage.
               On theſe grounds it hath beene thought very requiſite that mariage ſhould be ſolemnized in the day time (as a worke of light that need not be couertly and cloſely done) and that in a publike place, whether any, that will, may haue free acceſſe, either to except againſt it, and hinder it (if there be iuſt cauſe) or to be a witneſſe thereof, and to adde his bleſſing thereto. And among publike places the Church is thought the fitteſt, becauſe it is the houſe of praier, where perſons and actions are moſt ſolemnly bleſſed. And of all perſons a publike Miniſter is thought to be the meeteſt to celebrate mariage, and to ioyne 
                     Coniugium benedictione ſacer dotali ſanctificari oportet. Ambr. epiſt. 70. the parties to be maried, together, becauſe he ſtands in Gods roome, and in and by his miniſterie God ioyneth them together, and bleſſeth them: ſo as after the miniſter hath rightly ioyned man and wife together in matrimony, it may be well

ſaid, Thoſe whom God hath ioyned together, let no man put aſunder. The forme of conſecrating mariage, which is preſcribed in our liturgie or common-prayer-booke, doth ſo diſtinctly, perſpicuouſly, and fully ſet downe whatſoeuer is to be obſerued and done by the parties to be maried, their parents, or other gouernours, and the Miniſter that ioyneth them together, that I can adde nothing thereunto. There are declared the grounds, ends, and vſes of mariage. There open proclamation is made whether any can except againſt the intended mariage. There each partie is ſolemnly charged, that if either of them doe know any impediment, why they may not lawfully be maried, to diſcloſe it. There alſo each partie is openly demanded if freely and willingly they will take one another for man and wife. There the duties of maried perſons are declared, and they ſeuerally asked whether they will ſubiect themſelues thereto or no. All which being openly profeſſed, the parent or ſome in his ſtead is called forth to giue the Bride to the Bridegroome. Then they two actually taking each other to be man and wife, and teſtifying the ſame by expreſſe words, and by mutuall pledges, the Miniſter in Gods name ioyneth them together, pronounceth them to be lawfull husband and wife, and by prayer craueth Gods bleſſing vpon the action, and vpon their perſons. Thus is the mariage conſecrated, and they two made one fleſh, that is, lawfully ioyned together by the inuiolable bond of mariage.
            
            
               §. 20. Of clandeſtine mariages.
               
               Contrary are clandeſtine mariages, ſuch as are made in priuate houſes, or other ſecret places, or in Churches without a ſufficient number of witneſſes, or in the night time, or without a lawfull Miniſter of the word, with the like. As ſuch ſeeking of ſecrecie taketh much from the honour and dignitie of mariage, ſo it implieth ſome euill cleauing thereto: For euery 
                  
                     Ioh. 3. 20. 
                  man that euill doth hateth the light. There is little hope that ſuch mariages ſhould haue any good ſucceſſe. For where ſuch meanes as are ſanctified for obtaining a bleſſing on mariage are neglected, what bleſſing can thereupon be expected?
            
            
               
               §. 21. Of a ciuill celebrating of mariage.
               
               Though vpon the forenamed conſecrating of mariage it be in regard of the ſubſtance thereof fully conſummate, yet for the greater ſolemnity of ſo honourable a thing, it is very requiſite that further there be added a ciuill celebration of it: vnder 
                     Magnifico conuiuio nuptiae celebrantur: laeta omnia, munera ſponſalia, &c. Greg. Naz. ad Vital. vide plura ibid. de coniugij ſolennitate. Mariage a time of reioycing. which I compriſe all thoſe lawfull cuſtomes that are vſed for the ſetting forth of the outward ſolemnitie thereof, as meeting of friends, accompanying the Bridegroome and Bride both to and from the Church, putting on beſt apparell, feaſting, with other tokens of reioycing: for which we haue expreſſe warrant out of Gods word.
               For the generall, that the mariage time is a time of reioycing, ſome gather from the notation of the word, as if it were ſtiled mariage of merry age. But to let that paſſe, The Scripture vſeth to ſet forth a time of reioycing by the 
                     Iſa. 62. 5. 
                  ioy of the Bridegroome ouer his Bride, and ſtileth 
                     Ier. 33. 11. 
                  the voice of a Bridegroome and a Bride, the voice of ioy and gladneſſe. And on the contrary counteth it a iudgement, when 
                     Ier. 7. 34. Ioel 2. 16. ioy is taken away from the Bridegroome and the Bride.
               For meeting of friends at the time of mariage, it is noted that 
                     Gen. 29. 22. 
                  Laban gathered together all the men of the place, when his daughter was maried. And when Sampſon was maried, 
                     Iudg. 14. 11. 
                  they brought thirtie companions to him. And when a friend of the virgin Marie was maried, 
                     Ioh. 2. 2. Ieſus and his Diſciples, beſides many other, were inuited thereto. And in the parable of the mariage of the Kings ſonne, it is noted that 
                     Mat. 22. 3. 
                  many gueſts were bidden to the wedding. In all which hiſtories it is further noted, that feaſts were made at the ſolemnizing of thoſe mariages. And the phraſes which the Prophet vſeth of 
                     Iſa. 61. 10. Ier. 2. 32. 
                  a Bridegroomes decking himſelfe with ornaments, and a Brides adorning her ſelfe with Iewels, giue warrant for putting on the beſt apparell at that time.
               Here by the way let good heed be taken, that the things which may lawfully be vſed, be not vnlawfully abuſed, as commonly mariage-feſtiuities, and that eſpecially in feaſtings, are.

And for the more cheerefulneſſe therein, witty queſtions and doubtfull riddles may be propounded (as Sampſon did) to exerciſe the wit

Yea further, that the mariage meeting, mirth, and feaſting may be the better ſanctified, good choice is to be made of the gueſts that are inuited thereto. Hereof we haue a worthy patterne in thoſe who were maried in Cana of Galile, 
                     Ioh. 2. 1, 2.

                  nd inuited to their feaſt Ieſus, his mother, and his Diſciples. Such as Ieſus, will miniſter occaſion of ſauourie and ſanctified communication, whereby all the gueſts may be much edified.

               Aboue all, that the mirth and ioy of mariage be not dampt,

as Belſhazzars was, let them that are maried, and all that come 
                     Dan. 5. 5. to reioyce with them, be ſure that they haue true aſſurance of their ſpirituall mariage with Chriſt, and of a good right in him to the creatures which they vſe. Otherwiſe their ſinnes will be as that hand-writing which appeared to Belſhazzar on the wall.
               Finally, in regard of that libertie which God giueth with plentie and abundance to eat of the fat, and drinke of the 
                     Nehe. 8. 10. ſweet, let the poore that ſcarce haue ſufficiencie be remembred.
               Thus by a right celebrating of mariage, is it much honoured: and man and wife with much honour are brought together.
            
            
               §. 23. Of the honour of mariage in regard of the firſt inſtitution thereof.
               
               Great reaſon there is why mariage ſhould with ſuch honour be ſolemnized. For it is a moſt honourable thing. Honourable in the inſtitution, ends, priuiledges, and myſterie thereof. No ordinance was more honourable in the firſt inſtitution thereof, as is euident by the Author thereof, the Place where it was inſtituted, the Time when it was inſtituted, the Perſons who were firſt maried, and the Manner of ioyning them together.
               1. The Author and firſt Inſtitutor of mariage was the Lord 
                     Gen. 2. 18, 21, 22 God. Could there haue beene a greater, or any way a more excellent Author?
               2. The Place was Paradiſe; the moſt faire, glorious, pleaſant, honourable, commodious, and euery way moſt excellent place that euer was in this world, Place, though it be but a circumſtance, addeth much to the honour of a thing. Solemat ordinances are made in honourable places. Thus with vs mariages are ſolemnized in Churches, not in priuate houſes.
               3. The Time was the moſt pure and perfect time that euer was in the world, when no ſinne or pollution of man had ſtained it, euen the time of mans innocencie. Puritie addeth much to the honour of a thing.
               4. The Perſons were the moſt honourable that euer were euen the firſt father and mother of all mankinde, they who had an abſolute power and dominion ouer all creatures, and

to whom all were ſubiect. None but they euer had a true monarchy ouer the whole world.
               5. The Manner was with as great deliberation as euer was vſed in inſtituting any ordinance. For firſt the three glorious 
                     Gen. 2. 18. Cui hoc dicitur? non creatae alicui potentiae, ſed ei qui exſe natus eſt, Conſiliario admirabili, &c. Chryſ. in Gen. hom. 14. perſons in the Trinity doe meet to aduiſe about it. For The Lord God ſaid, and to whom ſhould he ſpeake? not to any created power, but to him that was begotten of himſelfe, that Wonderfull, Counſeller, &c. In this conſultation this ordinance is found to be very needfull: (It is not good for man to be alone) thereupon a determination is ſet downe, to make an helpe meet for man. For the better effecting hereof the Lord proceedeth thereto very deliberatly, by ſundry ſteps, and degrees.
               1. All the creatures that liued on the earth, or breathed in the aire, are brought before man, to ſee if an helpe meet for him might be found among them.
               2. Euery of them being thorowly viewed, and found vnfit, another creature is made and that out of mans ſubſtance and ſide, and after his image.
               3. This excellent creature thus made is by the maker therof preſented to man, to ſee how he would like it.
               4. Man manifeſting a good liking to her, ſhe is giuen to him to be his wife.
               5. The inuiolable law of the neere and firme vnion of man and wife together is enacted.
               Let all the forenamed branches concerning the firſt inſtitution of mariage expreſly recorded by the holy Ghoſt be well weighed, and we ſhall eaſily ſee that there is no ordinance now in force among the ſonnes of men ſo honourable in the inſtitution thereof, as this.
            
            
               §. 24. Of the Ends of Mariage.
               
               2. The Ends for which mariage was ordained adde much to the honour thereof. They are eſpecially three. 
                     Prima ſocietas in ipſo coniugio eſt &c. Id autē eſt principium vrbis, & quaſi ſeminarium reip. Cic. Offic. lib. 1.
               
               1. That the world might be increaſed: and not ſimply increaſed, but with a legitimate brood, and diſtinct families, which are the ſeminaries of cities and common-wealths. Yea alſo that in the world the Church by an holy ſeed might be preſerued, and propagated, Mal. 2. 15.
               2. That men might auoid fornication (1 Cor. 7. 2.) and

poſſeſſe their veſſels in holineſſe and honour. In regard of that 
                     Qui tentationum procell as cum difficultate ſalutis tolerant, coniugij portum petant. Greg. in Poſt. part. 3. admon. 28. proneneſſe which is in mans corrupt nature to luſt, this end addeth much to the honour of mariage. It ſheweth that mariage is as an hauen to ſuch as are in ieopardy of their ſaluation through the guſts of temptations to luſt. No ſinne is more hereditary; none whereof more children of Adam doe partake, then this. Well might Chriſt ſay (Mat. 19. 11) all men receiue not this ſaying.
               
               Of all the children of Adam that euer were, not one to a million of thoſe that haue come to ripeneſſe of yeares haue beene true Eunuches all their life time. Againſt this hereditary diſeaſe no remedie is ſo ſoueraigne as this. Yea for thoſe that haue not the gift of continency this is the only warranted, and ſanctified remedy.
               3. That man and wife might be a mutuall helpe one to 
                     Ad adiumentum mulier data eſt viro. Ambr. Offic. l. 1. c. 28. another, (Gen. 2. 18.) An helpe as for bringing forth, ſo for bringing vp children; and as for erecting, ſo for well gouerning their family. An helpe alſo for well ordering proſperity, and well bearing aduerſity. An helpe in health and ſickneſſe. 
                     Ut non ſolum honeſtè, ſed & commodè viuat. Chryſ. in Gen. 2. hom. 14. An helpe while both liue together, and when one is by death taken from the other. In this reſpect it is ſaid (Pro. 18. 22.) who ſo findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, which by the rule of relation is true alſo, of an husband. Licet adiuvent hominem laboribus ſuis multa irrationabilla, nullum tamen par eſt rationali mulieri. Chryſ. ibid.
               
               No ſuch helpe can man haue from any other creature as from a wife; or a woman as from an husband.
            
            
               §. 25. Of the Priuileges of mariage.
               
               III. If (
                     Rom. 3. 1. as once of circumciſion) it be demanded what is the priuilege, aduantage, and profit of mariage, I anſwer, Much euery way.

               3. It is the ordinarie meanes to make them Maſters and Miſtreſſes. All theſe are great dignities, wherein the image and glorie of God conſiſteth.

                     Appian. lib. 2. debel. ciu.
                   In pleading cauſes, or giuing ſentence, they had the firſt place; and in choice of offices they were preferred. Sucton. in Aug. In meetings they had the vpper hand. 
                     Ariſt. Polit. li. 2. cap. 7. & Codic lib. 10. tit. 63. And if they had many children they were exempted from watchings, and other like burthenſome functions. Among vs, if the younger ſiſter be maried before the elder, the preheminency and precedency

                  s giuen to the younger.
               The priuileges and honours which are giuen to maried perſons, were queſtionleſſe the ground of that cuſtome which Laban mentioneth of his country; that the younger was not to 
                     Gen. 29. 26. be maried before the elder.
            
            
               §. 26. Of the myſterie of Mariage.
               
               IIII. Great is that myſterie which is ſet forth by mariage, namely the ſacred, ſpirituall, reall, and inuiolable vnion betwixt Chriſt and his Church: which is excellently deciphe

               Hereby man and wife who intirely, as they ought, loue one another, haue an euident demonſtration of Chriſts loue to them. For as parents by that affection which they beare to their children, may better diſcerne the minde, and meaning of God towards them, then ſuch as neuer had childe, ſo may maried perſons better know the diſpoſition of Ieſus Chriſt, who is the ſpouſe of euery faithfull ſoule, then ſingle perſons.
            
            
               §. 27. Of Mariage and ſingle life compared together.
               
               Let now the admirers and praiſers of a ſingle eſtate bring forth all their reaſons, and put them in the other ſcole againſt mariage. If theſe two be duly poiſed, and rightly weyed, we ſhall finde ſingle life too light to be compared with honeſt mariage. All that can be ſaid for the ſingle eſtate, is grounded vpon accidentall occaſions. Saint Paul, who of all the pen-men of holy Scripture hath ſpoken moſt for it, draweth all his commendations to the head of Expediency, and reſtraineth all vnto 1 Cor. 7. 26. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  preſent neceſſity.
               
               
                  Obiect. He vſeth theſe words (
                     Verſ. 1. 
                  good, and 
                     Verſ. 38. 
                  better.)
               
               
                  Anſw. Thoſe words haue relation not to vertue, but to expediencie: neither are they ſpoken in oppoſition to vice and

ſinne, for then would it follow, that to marie (which is Gods ordinance, and honourable in all) were euill and ſinfull: which is to reuiue 
                     Saturniliani de quibus Epiph. haer. 23. that ancient hereſie, that mariage is of the deuill. 
                  Si quis coinquinationem vocet legitimā commixtionem, habet inhabitatorem draconem Apoſtatam. Ignat. Epiſt. ad Philad. Of old they who haue called lawfull mariage a defilement, haue beene ſaid to haue the Apoſtate dragon dwelling in them. But the Apoſtle ſtileth that good, which is commodious, and that better which is more expedient: and yet not ſimply more expedient, but to ſome perſons at ſome times. For if any haue not the gift of continency, it is not only commodious or more expedient that they marie, but alſo abſolutely neceſſarie. They are commanded ſo to doe (1 Cor. 7. 9.) Yet on the other ſide, if any haue the gift of continency, they are not ſimply bound from mariage; there be other occaſions, beſide auoiding fornication, to moue them to marie. It is therefore truly ſaid that Virginity is not commanded, but aduiſed vnto. 
                  
                     Uirginitas non eſt iuſſa ſed admonita. Bernard. de modo benè viu. ſerm. 21. 
                  We haue no precept for it, but leaue it to the power of them that haue that power. So farre forth as men and women ſee iuſt occaſion of abſtaining from mariage (being at leaſt able ſo to doe) they are by the Apoſtle perſwaded to vſe their liberty and keepe themſelues free. But all the occaſions which

Apoſt. li. 4. cap. 14. moue them to remaine ſingle ariſe from the weakneſſe and wickedneſſe of men. Their wickedneſſe who raiſe troubles againſt others, their weakneſſe who ſuffer themſelues to be diſquieted and too much diſtracted with affaires of the family, care for wife, children, and the like. Were it not for the wickedneſſe of ſome, and weakneſſe of others, to pleaſe an huſband 
                  1 Cor. 7. 32, 33, 34. 
                  or a wife, would be no hiderance to pleaſing of the Lord. If therefore man had ſtood in his intire and innocent eſtate, no ſuch wickedneſſe or weakneſſe had ſeized vpon him: and then in no reſpect could the ſingle eſtate haue beene preferred 
                     S. Eccleſia & virginitatem glorificat, & nuptias pudicas honorat. Epiph. haer. 48. before the maried. But ſince the fall, Virginity (where it is giuen) may be of good vſe: and therefore the Church doth giue due honour both to virginity and mariage.
            
            
               §. 28. Of celebrating mariage with ſorrow.
               
               Contrary to the forenamed ioyfull celebrating of mariage are all thoſe indirect courſes which bring much griefe, trouble and vexation thereunto: as forced, ſtolne, vnequall, or any other way vnlawfull mariages: mariages without parents, or

other gouernours and friends conſent: or hudled vp to auoid the danger of law for former vncleanneſſe committed, with the like. Many by their prepoſterous and vndue performing of ſo weightie a matter, doe not only cauſe great trouble and diſquietneſſe on the mariage day, but alſo much ſorrow all the daies of their life. If ſuch finde no ioy, comfort or helpe in mariage, but rather the contrary, let them not blame Gods ordinance, but their owne folly and peruerſneſſe.
            
         
         
            
               The ſecond Treatiſe. PART. II. Of common-mutuall duties betwixt Man and Wife.
            
            
               §. 1. Of the heads of thoſe common-mutuall duties.
               
               IN the firſt part of this Treatiſe concerning Man and Wife, hath beene declared, who are ſo to be accounted: in this ſecond part their common-mutuall duties are to be laid forth. Theſe are either De neceſſitate ad eſſe. 
                  abſolutely neceſſary for the being and abiding of mariage: or De honeſtate ad benè eſſe. needfull and requiſite for the well being and well abiding of it, that is, for the good eſtate of mariage, and for a commendable, and comfortable liuing together.
               
                  
                     
                        There are two kindes of the former,
                        1. Matrimoniall Vnity.

               The latter alſo may be drawne to two heads: for they are either ſuch as the maried couple are mutually to performe each to other: or ſuch as both of them are ioyntly to performe to others.
               
               
                  
                     
                        Thoſe mutuall duties are
                        1. A louing affection of one to another.

               §. 2. Of Matrimoniall vnitie.
               
               The firſt, higheſt, chiefeſt, and moſt abſolutely neceſſarie common-mutuall dutie betwixt Man and Wife, is Matrimoniall Vnitie, whereby husband and wife doe account one another to be one fleſh, and accordingly preſerue the inuiolable vnion whereby they are knit together. This is that dutie which the Apoſtle inioyneth to husbands and wiues, in theſe words, Let 
                  1 Cor. 7. 10, 11. 
                  not the wife depart from her husband: Let not the husband put away his wife. He there ſpeaketh of renouncing each other, and making the matrimoniall bond fruſtrate, and of no effect: which bond he would haue to be kept firme and inuiolable, and they two who are thereby made one, conſtantly to remaine one, and not to make themſelues two againe. This matrimoniall vnitie is ſo neceſſarie, as it may not be diſ-united or diſſolued though one be a Chriſtian, the other a Pagan. If any brother 
                  1 Cor. 7. 12, 13. (ſaith the Apoſtle) hath a wife that beleeueth not, let him not put her away. And the woman which hath an husband that beleeueth not, let her not leaue him.
               
               The reaſons of this inuiolable vnion are eſpecially two: One taken from the Author of mariage: the other from the Nature thereof.
               1. The Author of mariage is God. It is his ordinance: and 
                     Gen. 2. 18, 22, 24 he it is that by his ordinance hath made of two, one fleſh. Now marke the conſequence which Chriſt as a ruled caſe, and vndeniable principle inferreth thereon, What God hath ioyned together 
                  
                     Mat 19. 6. 
                  let no man put aſunder: If no man, then nor wife, nor huſband himſelfe.
               2. Such is the Nature of the matrimoniall bond as it maketh

of two one, and See Treat. 1 §. 79, 80. more firmely bindeth them two together, then any other bond can binde any other two together, how then ſhould they be two againe?
            
            
               §. 3. Of Deſertion.
               
               The vice contrary to matrimoniall vnitie is Deſertion, when one of the maried couple through indignation of the true religion, and vtter deteſtation thereof, or ſome other like cauſe, ſhall apparently renounce all matrimoniall vnitie, and withdraw him or her ſelfe from all ſocietie with the other, and liue among Infidels, Idolaters, heretiques, or other ſuch perſecutors, as a faithfull Chriſtian with ſafetie of life, or a good conſcience, cannot abide among; and though all good meanes that can be thought of be vſed to reclaime the partie ſo departed, yet nothing will preuaile, but obſtinatly perſiſteth in renouncing all matrimoniall fellowſhip.
               This Deſertion is in the caſe of mariage ſo capitall, as it 
                     Infidelis diſcedens in matrimonium peccare dignoſcitur: ita
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         non eſt ei fides ſeruanda coniugij. Ambr. in 1 Cor. 7. freeth the innocent partie from any further ſeeking after the other. In which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith, If the vnbeleeuing depart, let him depart. A brother or a ſiſter is not vnder bondage in ſuch caſes, 1 Cor. 7. 15. By bondage he meaneth matrimoniall ſubiection (by reaſon whereof neither of the maried perſons haue power of their owne body, but one of the others.) Now they that are not vnder this bondage, are not bound to ſeeke after it. That Deſertion therefore on the delinquents

                   part is ſuch diſſolution of mariage, as freeth the innocent partie from the bondage thereof. In many reformed Churches beyond the ſeas Deſertion is accounted ſo farre to diſſolue the very bond of mariage, as libertie is giuen to the partie forſaken to marie another: and it is alſo applied to other caſes then that which is aboue mentioned: as when an 
                     P. Martyr in 1 Cor. 7. 13. Melanct. in loc. de Coniug.
                   Infidell, Idolater, or Heretique ſhall depart from one of the true religion for other cauſes then hatred of religion: or when both man and wife hauing liued as Idolaters among Idolaters, 
                     Zanchius de Oper. Dei lib. 4. cap. 1. one of them being conuerted to the true faith, leaueth his abode among Idolaters, and goeth to the profeſſors of the true faith, but can by no meanes get the other partie to remoue: or when one of the true religion ſhall depart from another of the ſame profeſſion, and will by no meanes be brought to liue

with the partie ſo left, but openly manifeſteth peremptorie obſtinacie; the matter being heard and adiudged by the Magiſtrate, the mariage bond may be broken, and libertie giuen to the partie forſaken to mary another. But becauſe our Church hath no ſuch cuſtome, nor our law determined ſuch caſes, I leaue them to the cuſtome of other Churches.
            
            
               §. 4. Of matrimoniall Chaſtitie.
               
               The ſecond neceſſarie common-mutuall mariage-dutie is Matrimoniall chaſtitie. Chaſtitie in a large extent is taken for all manner of puritie in ſoule or body: in which reſpect the Apoſtle calleth the Church of God a chaſte virgin. But in the 1 Cor. 11. 2. ſenſe wherein we here vſe it, it eſpecially appertaineth to the body: which is that vertue whereby we poſſeſſe our veſſels (to 1 Theſſ. 4. 4. vſe the Apoſtles phraſe) in holineſſe and honour: or more plainly to our purpoſe, whereby we keepe our bodies vndefiled.
               
                  
                     
                        Chaſtitie thus reſtrained to the body is of
                        
                           Single life.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Wedlocke.
                        
                         
                     
                  
               
               That of ſingle life is oppoſed to fornication: and it is either of ſuch as neuer were maried. Such an one was S. Paul, in which reſpect he wiſheth that all were as he, 1 Cor. 7. 7. Or of ſuch as are lawfully freed from the bond of mariage. Such an one the Apoſtle calleth 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 1 Tim. 5. 5. Paphnutius congreſſum cum legitima vxore caſtitatem eſſe dicebat. Socr. hiſt. Eccl. l. 1. cap. 11. 
                  a widow indeed. Chaſtitie of wedlocke is that vertue whereby parties maried, obſeruing the lawfull and honeſt vſe of mariage, keepe their bodies from being defiled with ſtrange fleſh: thus the Apoſtle commandeth wiues to be chaſte, Tit. 2. 5. So as Qui leges coniugij ſeruat homini continenti par ſit. Greg. Naz. Cygn. Carm. they that keepe the lawes of wedlocke are as chaſte as they that containe.
               Here by the way note the dotage of our aduerſaries, who thinke there is no chaſtitie, but of ſingle perſons: whereupon in their ſpeeches and writings 
                     Clerici caſtitatem profeſſi matrimonium contrahere non poſſunt. Concil. Trid. § 24. Can 9. they oppoſe chaſtitie and matrimonie one to another, as two contraries.
               Some of their holy Fathers and Popes, and thoſe not the leaſt learned, nor of worſt note among them, haue inferred by their arguments againſt Prieſts mariage, that Mariage is a liuing in the fleſh, a ſowing to the fleſh, a pollution of the fleſh. To that 
                     Siricius & Innocentius 3. Gratian. Decr. diſtinct. 31. 82. 1 Cor. 7. 5. purpoſe S. Pauls aduice to man and wife to abſtaine, that they may giue themſelues to faſting and prayer, is vrged: but directly contrarie to the intent of the Apoſtle. For,
               
                  
1. He ſpeaketh there of extraordinarie humiliation. 2. He interpoſeth this limitation, for a time. 3. He ſaith not ſimply, that ye may pray, but that ye may giue your ſelues. (or haue

               But how can the forenamed ſpots and blots of mariage ſtand with that beautie and glorie wherewith the Apoſtle ſetteth it forth in theſe words, Mariage is honourable in all, H
                        •
                     b. 13. 4. If mariage were as Papiſts ſet it forth to be, the mariagebed were verie vnfitly called a bed vndefiled.
               
               Behold how contrarie the ſpirits of S. Paul and of their Popes were. I wot well farre more contrarie then chaſtitie and matrimonie.
               But to returne to our matter, cleare it is, that maried perſons may be chaſte, and accordingly they ought to be chaſte. To which purpoſe the Apoſtle counſelling men and women, for auoiding fornication, to haue wiues and husbands, inſerteth this particle OWNE (Let euerie man haue his OWNE wife, 
                  1 Cor. 7. 2. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  and euerie woman haue her OWNE husband) whereby he implieth, that they ſhould not haue to doe with any other. That which 
                     Prou. 5. 19. See more of this text in Treat. 4. §. 11. 
                  Salomon expreſſeth of an husband, by the rule of relation muſt be applied to a wife. As the man muſt be ſatisfied at all times in his wife, and euen rauiſht with her loue; ſo muſt the woman be ſatisfied at all times in her husband, and euen rauiſht with his loue. By the like rule the precept giuen to wiues, to be chaſte, muſt husbands take as directed to themſelues 
                     Tit. 2. 5. alſo, and be chaſte. This dutie did Iſaak and Rebekah faithfully and mutually performe each to other.
               1. It was one maine end, why mariage (eſpecially ſince the Reaſons for mariage-chaſtitie. fall of man) was ordained, to liue chaſtely. This the Apoſtle implieth, where he ſaith, to auoid fornication, let euerie man haue his owne wife, and let euerie woman haue her owne huſband. 1. Chaſtitie one end of mariage. 1 Cor. 7. 2. Ibid. verſ. 9. And againe, If they cannot containe let them marrie.
               
               2. By chaſtitie is a godly ſeed preſerued on earth. By this reaſon doth the Prophet Malachie inforce this dutie. For after he had ſaid, that the Lord made one, meaning of two one fleſh 2. By chaſtitie a godly ſeed preſerued. Mal. 2. 16. by mariage, he inferreth this exhortation, Therefore take heed to your ſpirit, and let none deale vnfaithfully againſt the wife of his youth.
               
               
                  
3. An eſpeciall part of the honour of mariage conſiſteth in 3. Chaſtitie the honour of mariage. Heb. 13. 4. chaſtitie: whereupon the Apoſtle hauing giuen this high commendation of mariage, that it is honourable in all, addeth this clauſe (and the bed vndefiled) to ſhew the reaſon of that honour. As if he had ſaid, Becauſe the mariage-bed is in it ſelfe a bed vndefiled, mariage is therefore in it ſelfe honourable, and doth ſo farre remaine honourable, as the bed remaineth vndefiled.
            
            
               §. 5. Of Adulterie.
               
               The vice contrarie to matrimoniall chaſtitie is Adulterie, one of the moſt capitall vices in that eſtate: a vice whereby way is made for Diuorce: as is cleare and euident by the determination of Chriſt himſelfe, concerning that point, firſt 
                     Matth. 5. 32. propounded in his ſermon on the mount, and againe 
                     Matth. 19. 9. Chriſtus ab adultera vero ſeparari permittit. Greg. Naz. Orat. 36. Vir poſt fornicationem non eſt vir, Chryſ. hom. 19. in 1 Cor. 7. repeated in his conference with the Phariſies, where condemning vniuſt diuorces, he excepteth the diuorce made for adulterie.
               And great reaſon there is thereof. For 1 Cor. 6. 16. the adulterer maketh himſelfe one fleſh with his harlot. Why then ſhould he remaine to be one fleſh with his wife? Two (ſaith the Law) ſhall be one fleſh: not three. The like may be ſaid of a wife committing adulterie.
            
            
               §. 6. Of pardoning adulterie vpon repentance.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. Seeing by adulterie iuſt cauſe of diuorce is giuen, may this fault vpon the repentance of the delinquent perſon be ſo forgiuen, as no diuorce be ſought by the innocent perſon, but both continue to liue together in wedlocke as before?
                  
                     Anſw. Though it be not meet in this caſe, to impoſe it as an inuiolable law vpon the innocent partie, to retaine the delinquent, becauſe of repentance (for we haue direct and ſtrict warrant for it) yet I doubt not but they may ſo doe, if they will, and that without iuſt exception to the contrarie, they ought ſo to doe. For the law of diuorce did not neceſſarily enioyne any to ſue out the bill, but only afforded them libertie to vſe that puniſhment if they ſaw cauſe. I doubt not but for warrant of this libertie, we may take Gods patterne, in retaining Churches and people after they haue committed ſpirituall adulterie: and Chriſts forgiuing the woman that had committed adulterie. For, 
                        Poſtquam Chriſtus ait adulterae, nec ego te damnabo: vade, deinceps noli peccare, quis non intelligat, debere maritum ignoſcere quod videt ignouiſſe Dominum ambor um: nec iam ſe debere adulteram dicere cuius poenitentis crimen diuina credit miſeratione deletam? Aug. de adult. Coniug. lib. 2. cap. 6. 
                     Seeing Chriſt ſaid to an adult ereſſe, I condemne thee not, goe and ſinne no more, who cannot conceiue that an husband ought to
                     
                     forgiue that which he ſeeth the Lord both of husband and wife hath forgiuen: and that he ought not to account her an adultereſſe, whoſe fault he beleeueth to be blotted out, by the mercie of God, vpon her repentance?
                  
               
            
            
               §. 7. Of the difference of adultery in a man, and in a wife.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. Is the bond of mariage as much violated on the Adultery as great a ſinne in a man as in his wife. Lex Jul. de Adult. l. 1. Orif. Codic. in l. Illuſt. Greg. Sayr. Clau. reg. l. 9. c. 16. mans part when he committeth adulterie as on the womans when ſhe doth ſo?
                  
                     Anſw. Though the ancient Romans and Canoniſts haue aggrauated the womans fault in this kinde farre aboue the mans, and giuen the man more priuiledges then the woman, yet I ſee not how that difference in the ſinne can ſtand with the tenour of Gods word. I denie not but that more inconueniences may follow vpon the womans default then vpon the mans: as, greater infamy before men, worſe diſturbance More inconueniences of a womans adultery, then a mans. of the family, more miſtaking of legitimate, or illegitimate children, with the like. The man cannot ſo well know which be his owne children, as the woman; he may take baſe children to be his owne, and ſo caſt the inheritance vpon them; and ſuſpect his owne to be baſely borne, and ſo depriue them of their patrimony. But the woman is freed from all ſuch miſtakings. Yet in regard of the breach of wedlocke, and tranſgreſſion againſt God, the ſinne of either partie is alike. Gods word maketh no diſparity betwixt them. At the beginning God ſaid of them both, 
                        Mat. 19. 5. 
                     they two ſhall be one fleſh: not the woman only with the man, but the man alſo with the woman is made one fleſh. 
                     1 Cor. 7. 3, 4. Their power alſo ouer one another in this reſpect is alike. If on iuſt occaſion they abſtaine, 
                        Verſ. 5. it muſt be with mutuall conſent. If the husband leaue his wife, 
                        Verſ. 15. ſhe is as free, as he ſhould be, if ſhe left him. Accordingly the puniſhment 
                        Tanto grauius viros puniri oportet, quanto magis ad eos pertinet & virtute vincere, & exemplo regere ſoeminas. Aug. de adult. Coning. l. 2. c. 8. which by Gods law was to be inflicted on Adulterers is the ſame, whether the man or the woman be the delinquent, (Deut. 22. 22.) If difference be made, it is meet that adulterous husbands be ſo much the more ſeuerely puniſhed, by how much the more it appertaineth to them to excell in vertue, and to gouerne their wiues by example.
               
            
            
               §. 8. Of the hainouſneſſe of Adulterie.
               
               But to returne to the diſcouery of the hainouſneſſe of Adulterie,

               2. By it the goods of the family are much waſted: the adulterous husband ſpending that wherewith he ſhould prouide for his family, on his harlot: and the adulterous wife purloining what ſhe can from her husband.
               3. By it husbands and wiues are ſtirred vp to wiſh, and long after one anothers death: and not only inwardly in heart to wiſh it, but outwardly alſo in deed to practiſe it.
               4. If from this ſinne there ariſe not a gauling and terrifying

conſcience (as oft there doth) then (which is worſe) a ſeared conſcience, an hard heart, a reprobate ſenſe, and an impudent face.

                  time (that it be not vainly and idly ſpent) to omit, I ſay, theſe and other like remedies.) One of the beſt remedies that can be preſcribed to maried perſons (next to an 
                     Gen. 39. 9. Pro. 2. 16. awfull feare of God, and a continuall ſetting of him before them, whereſoeuer they are) is, that husband and wife mutually delight each in other, and maintaine a pure and feruent loue betwixt

themſelues, yeelding that 1 Cor. 7. 2, 3, 5, 9. 
                  due beneuolence one to another which is warranted & ſanctified by Gods word, and ordained of God for this particular end. This due beneuolence (as the Apoſtle ſtileth it) is one of the moſt proper and eſſentiall acts of mariage: and neceſſary for the maine and principall ends thereof: as for preſeruation of chaſtitie in ſuch as haue not the gift of continency, for increaſing the world with a legitimate brood, and for linking the affections of the maried couple more firmely together. Theſe ends of mariage, at leaſt the two former, are made void without this duty be performed.
               As it is called 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  beneuolence becauſe it muſt be performed with good will and delight, willingly, readily and cheerefully; ſo it is ſaid to be 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  due becauſe it is a debt which the wife oweth to her husband, and he to her. 1 Cor. 7. 4. 
                  For the wife hath not the power of her owne body, but the husband; and likewiſe alſo the husband hath not the power of his owne body, but the wife.
               
               I haue my warrant from the Apoſtle to preſcribe this dutie as a remedie againſt adulterie. For 1 Cor. 7. 2, 3. 
                  to auoid fornication, he aduiſeth man and wife to render due beneuolence one to another. If then this queſtion be moued (How will mariage keep men and women from adulterie?) this anſwer out of the Apoſtles words may be giuen (by rendring due beneuolence:) which he further inculcateth by declaring the miſchiefe that may follow vpon the neglect of this dutie, namely 
                     Verſ. 5. 
                  a caſting of themſelues into the ſnares of Satan. Well might he preſſe this dutie to that end, becauſe no other meanes is of like force: nor faſting, nor watching, nor hard lodging, nor long trauell, nor much labour, nor cold, nor ſolitarineſſe, nor any thing elſe. Dum ſolitudinis me deſerta vallarent, ardorem naturae ferre non poteram: quem cùm crebris ieiunijs frangerem, mens cogitationibus aeſtuabat. Hier. ad Ruſt. Mon. Lege eundem ad Euſtoc. de cuſtod. virgin. Some that haue by theſe meanes endeuoured much to beat downe their bodies, and ſubdue luſt (but neglected the forenamed remedie) haue notwithſtanding felt luſt boiling in them.
               There are two extremes contrarie to this dutie. One in the defect: another in the exceſſe.
               
               
                  Defect therein is, when in caſe of need it is not required, or being required by the one, it is not yeelded by the other. Modeſtie is pretended by ſome for not requiring it: but in a duty ſo warrantable and needfull, pretence of modeſty is (to ſpeake the leaſt) a ſigne of great infirmitie, and a cauſe of much iniquitie.

To denie this dutie being iuſtly required, is to denie a due debt, and to giue Satan great aduantage. The puniſhment inflicted on Onan, (Gen. 38. 9, 10.) ſheweth how great a wrong this is. From that puniſhment 
                     Hebraei inquiunt perinde vt homicidam reum eſſe qui temerè ſemen profundit. Merc. in Gen. 38. 9. the Hebrews gather that this ſinne is a kinde of murther. It is ſo much the more hainous when hatred, ſtoutneſſe, niceneſſe, feare of hauing too many children, or any other like reſpects, are the cauſe thereof.
               
                  Exceſſe is either in the meaſure, or in the time. In the meaſure, when husband or wife is inſatiable; prouoking, rather then aſſwaging luſt, and weakning their naturall vigor more then ſuppreſſing their vnnaturall humor. Many husbands and wiues are much oppreſſed by their bedfellowes vnſatiableneſſe in this kinde.

                     m ſuch polluted copulation, but a leprous and loathſome

Abſtinence in this time is ſet in the catalogue of thoſe notes which declare a man to be righteous (Eccleſ. 20. 7.) and the contrary intemperancy is put in the roll of ſuch abominations as prouoked God to ſpue out the Canaanits (Leuit. 18. 28.) and to forſake his owne inheritance (Ezek. 22. 10.)

               §. 10. Of mutuall loue betwixt man and wife.
               
               Hitherto of thoſe common mutuall duties which tend to the preſeruation of the very being of mariage, and are in that reſpect abſolutely neceſſarie. The other common mutuall duties (though they be not of ſo abſolute neceſſitie as the former) are in their kinde neceſſary for the good eſtate of mariage, and for the better preſeruing of that knot: ſo as, if they be not performed, the end and right vſe of mariage will be peruerted, & that eſtate made vncomfortable, & very burdenſome.

The firſt of theſe is Loue. A louing mutuall affection muſt paſſe betwixt husband and wife, or elſe no dutie will be well performed: this is the ground of all the reſt. In ſome reſpects Loue is proper and peculiar to an husband, as Treat. 4. §. 2. I purpoſe to ſhew when I come to ſpeake of an husbands particular duties. But Loue is alſo required of wiues, and they are commanded to be louers of their husbands, as well as husbands to loue their wiues: 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Tit. 2. 4. Col. 3. 19. ſo as it is a common mutuall dutie belonging to husband and wife too: and that is true wedlocke, when man and wife are linked together by the bond of loue. Vnder loue all other duties 
                     Hoc verum eſt coniugium, quando vinculo charitatis ſunt concatenati. Chryſ. hom. 45. in Gen.
                   are compriſed: for without it no dutie can be well performed. 
                     Rom. 13. 10. 
                  Loue is the fulfilling of the Law, that is, the very life of all thoſe duties which the law requireth. It is the 
                     Col. 3. 14. 
                  bond of perfection, which bindeth together all thoſe duties that paſſe betwixt partie and partie. Where loue aboundeth, there all duties will readily and cheerefully be performed. Where loue is wanting, there euery duty will either be altogether neglected, or ſo careleſly performed, that as good not be performed at all: in which reſpect the Apoſtle willeth, that all things be done 
                  1 Cor. 16. 14. 
                  in loue. Loue as it prouoketh the partie in whom it ruleth to doe all the good it can; ſo it ſtirreth vp the partie loued to repay good for good. It is like fire, which is not only hot in it ſelfe, but alſo conueigheth heat into that which is neere it: whence ariſeth a reflection of heat from one to another. Note how admirably this is ſet forth betwixt Chriſt and his Spouſe in the Song of Salomon: and it is further manifeſted in the examples of all good husbands and wiues noted in the Scripture: they did mutually beare a very louing affection one to another.
               Though loue be a general duty which euery one oweth to another, 
                     Matth. 5. 44. euen to his enemie, yet the neerer that God hath linked any together, the more are they bound to this dutie, and the more muſt they abound therein. But of all others are Treat. 1. §. 79, 80. man and wife moſt neerely and firmly linked together. Of all others therefore are they moſt bound hereunto, & that in the higheſt degree that may be, euen like to Ionathans loue, who loued Dauid 
                  1 Sam. 18. 1. Prou. 18. 22. 
                  as his owne ſoule. Salomon ſaith, He that findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth fauour of the Lord: which by the

rule of relation is alſo true of an husband, Shee that findeth an husband findeth a good thing, and obtaineth fauour of the Lord. Man and wife therefore are each to other an eſpeciall pledge of Gods fauour, and in this reſpect aboue all others vnder God to be loued. If this be the ground (as it ought to be) of their mutuall That which in Treat. 4. §. 2. 9. 11. is ſpoken of an husbands loue and intire affection, may alſo be applied in ſome reſpects to a wife: and ſo ſerue to amplifie this common mutuall dutie of loue. loue, their loue will be feruent and conſtant. Neither will the want, or withering of any outward allurements, as beautie, perſonage, parentage, friends, riches, honours, or the like, with-hold or with-draw, extinguiſh or extenuate their loue: neither will any excellencies of nature or grace in other husbands and wiues draw their hearts from their owne to thoſe other: nor yet will the loue of a former yoake-fellow dead and gone, any whit leſſen the loue of the liuing mate.
               This inſtance I haue the rather mentioned, becauſe in many, Loue of after venters to be as intire as of former. who are farre from ſetting their affection on ſtrange fleſh, their loue of a former husband or wife departed is ſo faſt fixed in their heart, as they can neuer againe ſo intirely loue any other. They who are ſo minded are not fit to be ioined with another yoke-fellow after they are looſed from one. If they mary againe, and manifeſt ſuch a minde, they plainly ſhew that they reſpect this or that perſon more then Gods ordinance. By Gods ordinance man and wife are no longer bound one to another then they liue together. Death is an abſolute diremption, and maketh an vtter diſſolution of the mariage bond. If the man 
                  
                     Rom. 7. 2, 3. 
                  be dead, the wife is deliuered from the law of the man, ſo as ſhee may take another man. Which liberty is alſo giuen to the man. Being now free, if they mary another (that other being now a true husband or wife) their loue muſt be as intire to that other as it was to the former: yea, and more intire, if there were any defect in the former. For as children maried out of their parents houſe muſt not retaine ſuch a loue of their parents as ſhall ſwallow vp their loue of the partie to whom they are maried, but muſt according to the law, leaue father and

mother, and cleaue to their yoke-fellow: ſo neither muſt the loue of a former husband or wife be predominant when they are maried to another. This other muſt be as cloſe cleaued vnto, as if they had neuer beene ioined to a former. The liuing husband or wife is the preſent pledge of Gods fauour. He is now thine owne husband: and ſhe is now thine owne wife: and not the partie that is dead. I denie not but the memorie of a vertuous husband or wife ought to be pretious to the ſuruiuing partie: for the memoriall of the iust is bleſſed. 
                  
                     Prou. 10. 7. But as the vertue of a perſon deceaſed may not be buried with the dead corps: ſo neither may the perſon be kept aboue ground with the memorie of his or her vertue: which after a ſort is done, when loue of the partie deceaſed either taketh away, or extenuateth the loue of the liuing. This is to giue dominion to the dead ouer the liuing: which is more then the law enioyneth.
            
            
               §. 11. Of husbands and wiues mutuall hatred contrary to loue.
               
               There is a generation of ſo crabbed and crooked a diſpoſition * See Treat. 3. § 8. & Treat. 4. §. 10. as they cannot loue, but rather hate one another becauſe they are man and wife: for many husbands hauing wiues, and wiues husbands euery way worthy to be loued, will notwithſtanding ſay to the aſtoniſhment of the hearers, I haue indeed a good husband, or I haue a good wife: but I cannot loue him, or I cannot loue her: and being demanded a reaſon, ſticke not openly and impudently to reply, I thinke I could loue him if he were not mine husband, or I thinke I could loue her if ſhe were not my wife. O more then monſtrous impudencie! Is not this directly to oppoſe againſt Gods ordinance, and againſt that order which he hath ſet betwixt man and woman? Is it not to trample vnder foot Gods fauour? Though there were nothing elſe to moue loue but this, that ſuch an one is thine huſband, or ſuch an one is thy wife, yet this ſhould be motiue enough. And ſhall this be the ground of thine hatred? Aſſuredly ſuch a ſpirit is a plaine diabolicall ſpirit, contrary to that ſpirit which is from aboue; and if it be not

caſt out, it will caſt thoſe whom it poſſeſſeth into the fire of hell.
            
            
               §. 12. Of mutuall peace betwixt Man and Wife.
               
               Among other meanes of maintaining an inward louing affection betwixt man and wife, outward mutuall peace, concord, and agreement is one of the principall. Whereupon the Apoſtle exhorteth to keepe the vnitie of the ſpirit in the bond of 
                  
                     Epheſ. 4. 3. 
                  peace: for peace is a bond that tieth one to another, and maketh them to be as one, euen one in ſpirit: as on the contrary ſide outward diſcord diſunites mens ſpirits. We are enioined to follow peace with all men: how much more of all perſons ought 
                     Heb. 12. 14. husbands to haue peace with their wiues, and wiues with their husbands? they are neerer then brothers and ſiſters. Behold then how good and pleaſant a thing it is for them to dwell together in vnity. §. 14. Prou. 21. 9. Dwell together they muſt: but without peace there is no dwelling together: It is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe. Perſons at variance were farre better be out of ſight and place, then preſent together. Out of ſight and place man and wife muſt not be, at peace therefore 
                     Portus eſt mulier, & maximū ſecuritatis remedium. Si ventis & fluctibus portum liberaueris ex foro reuerſus tranquillè viues. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. they muſt be. Mutuall peace betwixt them is a great refreſhing to their mindes, being beaten with the diſcords of others. It is ſaid that a wife is in this reſpect as an hauen to man (how much more man to his wife?) If the hauen be calme, and free from ſtormes and tempeſts, what a refreſhing will it be to the Mariner that hath beene toſſed in the ſea with windes and waues?
               For maintaining peace,
               1. All offences ſo much as poſſibly may be muſt be auoided. Directions for maintaining peace betwixt Man and Wife. The husband muſt be watchfull ouer himſelfe that he giue no offence to his wife: and ſo the wife on the other ſide. Offences cauſe contentions.
               2. When an offence is giuen by the one partie, it muſt 1. Auoid offence. not be taken by the other; but rather paſſed by: and then will not peace be broken. The ſecond blow makes 2. Take not offence. the fray. 3. Offer reconciliation.
               
               3. If both be incenſed together, the fire is like to be the

greater: with the greater ſpeed therefore muſt they both labour to put it out. Wrath muſt not lie in bed with two ſuch 
                     Eph. 4. 26. bed-fellowes: neither may they part beds for wrath ſake. That this fire may be the ſooner quenched, they muſt both ſtriue firſt to offer reconciliation. Theirs is the glory who doe firſt begin, for they are moſt properly the bleſſed peacemakers. Not 
                     Mat. 5. 9. to accept peace when it is offered is more then heatheniſh: but when wrath is incenſed, to ſeeke atonement is the dutie of a Chriſtian, and a grace that commeth from aboue.
               4. Children, ſeruants, nor any other in the family muſt be 4. Take no part with others. bolſtred vp by the one againſt the other. The mans partaking with any of the houſe againſt his wife, or the wiues againſt her husband, is an vſuall cauſe of contention betwixt man and wife.
               5. They muſt forbeare to twit one another in the teeth 5. Make not compariſons. with the husbands or wiues of other perſons: or with their owne former husbands or wiues (in caſe they haue had any before.) Compariſons in this kinde are very odious. They ſtir vp much paſſion, and cauſe great contentions.
               6. Aboue all they muſt take heed of raſh and vniuſt iealouſie, 6. Be not iealous. which is the bane of mariage, and greateſt cauſe of diſcontent that can be giuen betwixt man and wife. Iealous perſons are ready to picke quarrels, and to ſeeke occaſions of diſcord: they will take euery word, looke, action, and motion, in the worſe part, and ſo take offence where none is giuen. When iealouſie is once kindled, it is as a flaming fire that can hardly be put out. It maketh the partie whom it poſſeſſeth implacable.

Pleaſe one another. them ſuffer their owne will to be croſſed, rather then diſcontent to be giuen to the other. Saint Paul noteth this as a common 1 Cor. 7. 33, 34. mutuall dutie belonging to them both, and expreſſeth their care thereof vnder a word that ſignifieth more then ordinarie 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               §. 13. Of contentions betwixt man and wife.
               
               Contrary to mutuall peace are contentions betwixt man and wife: which are too frequent in moſt families, and by which 
                     Cùm vir & vxor domi diſſentiunt, nihilo melius naui iactata domus illa diſponitur, cùm gubernator aduerſus prorae directo. rem diſſentiat. Chryſ. loc. citat. Gen. 13. 8. the common good is much hindered. Diſcord betwixt man and wife in an houſe is as contention betwixt the maſter and pilot in a ſhip: may not great danger, and much miſchiefe be thence iuſtly feared? We heard before that man to his wife, and ſhe to him, is as an hauen. Now by experience we finde that if the hauen be tempeſtuous it is much more troubleſome, and dangerous to the Mariner then the wide ſea. Wherefore let man and wife be of the ſame minde one to another as Abraham was to Lot, and when occaſions of diſcord are offered, ſay, Let there be no ſtrife betwixt thee and me, for we are man and wife: no more two, but one fleſh.
               
            
            
               §. 14. Of husbands and wiues dwelling together.
               
               From a mutuall affection of loue proceedeth a mutuall prouident care in husband and wife one for another. In handling whereof we will firſt note the meanes whereby their mutuall prouidence may be the better effected and manifeſted, and then the matter whereabout it muſt be conuerſant. The meanes in one word is cohabitation. For a dutie it is that man and wife dwell together. The phraſe vſed in ſetting out the womans creation (he built a woman, whereby the erecting of 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Vide Muſc. in Gen. 2. 22. See Treat. 1. §. 79. a family is intimated) implieth as much: ſo doth the law of mariage whereby man is enioyned to leaue father and mother, and to cleaue vnto his wife, that is, to goe out of his fathers houſe, and to dwell with his wife: and ſo doth this phraſe (forget 
                  
                     Pſal. 45. 10. 
                  thy fathers houſe) taken from the dutie of a wife, and myſtically applied to the Church. Saint Peter expreſly chargeth huſbands 1 Pet. 3 7. to dwell with their wiues: and Saint Paul layeth it to 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13. the charge both of husbands and wiues not to leaue one another, but to dwell together, yea though the one be an infidell. Surely it was conſcience of this dutie which made the 
                     Iudg. 19. 3. Leuite to goe after his wife, that went away from him, to bring her home againe: and which made 
                     Gen. 31. 14. 
                  Iaakobs wiues to leaue their fathers houſe, and goe with their husband.

                     vxor.
                   The word vnder which Saint Peter compriſeth this dutie is a title appropriated to an husband: and an anſwerable title is appropriated to

a wife: from which the notation of our two vſuall Engliſh words (husband, houſewife) doth not much differ.
               The power which the one hath of the others body, and Reaſons for cohabitation. the aduantage which by liuing aſunder, they giue vnto Satan, (both of which are expreſly noted, 1 Cor. 7. 4, 5.) doe ſhew the neceſſity of this dutie: and the many benefits ariſing from thence doe further preſſe the equity of it. By husbands and Benefits of cohabitation. wiues dwelling together all mariage duties are better performed: mutuall loue is better bred, preſerued, and increaſed: the good gifts of either of them are better obſerued by the other: better helpe and ſuccour is mutually by each afforded to the other: and in fine they are made more capable of doing good one to another, and of receiuing good one from another. Why then ſhould they haue any minde of liuing aſunder, vnleſſe they be forced by extraordinary occaſions, as captiuity, cloſe impriſonment, contagious ſickneſſe, and ſuch like, which are no faults of theirs, but croſſes to be borne with griefe; and inſtant praier, together with all other good meanes, to be vſed to bring them together againe? Yea if the impriſonment, baniſhment, or other like kinde of abſence, D. Fulke againſt Rhem. on 1 Cor. 7. §. 6. be ſuch as one may if they will come at the other, the partie that is free ought to come to the other, if at leaſt that other require it.

                     Queſt. May there be any iuſt cauſes for man and wife willingly to liue aſunder?
                  
                     Anſw. There can nor ought to be any cauſe of vtter relinquiſhing one another, which is a kinde of §. 3. 
                     deſertion: but for liuing aſunder for a time there may be iuſt cauſes, as
                  1. Weighty and vrgent affaires which concerne the good of the Church, or commonwealth: as when a man is ſent forth to warre, or on an ambaſſage (in which caſe though he may take his wife with him, yet is he not neceſſarily bound there to, eſpecially if the place whither he is ſent be farre off, the paſſage thereto difficult and dangerous, and his abode there not long.) When 
                        Numb. 32. 26, 27. 
                     Reuben, Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manaſſch paſſed ouer Iorden to helpe their brethren in their battels

againſt the Canaanites, they left their wiues behinde them in their families: 2 Sam. 11. 3, 6. when Vriah went to warre, he left his wife at home: and 
                        Exo. 18. 2. when Moſes was to bring Iſrael out of Egypt, his wife remained at her fathers houſe.
                  2. Maine duties of their particular calling: as of Mariners, who are oft to be on the ſea: Merchants who trade in other countries: Lawyers who attend publike places of iuſtice: Courtiers, who in their months, or quarters, attend their Prince: Keepers of women in child-bed, and ſicke perſons: and other nurſes.

               Contrarie to the dutie of cohabitation is the doctrine of Papiſts, whereby they teach, that
               
                  Separation may be made betwixt man and wife for many cauſes from bed, or cohabitation, for a certaine or vncertaine time. The Councell of Trent is bold to denounce Anathema againſt ſuch as ſay, the Church erreth therein. If the many cauſes which they alledge, beſides adulterie, be well weighed, we ſhall finde them without all warrant of Gods word.

               §. 17. Of husbands and wiues vnlawfull abſenting themſelues one from another.
               
               Contrarie alſo to the forenamed dutie of cohabitation, is the practiſe of many men, who liuing themſelues in one place (ſuppoſe at London) ſend their wiues vnto ſome countrey houſe, and there euen mew them vp, as Hawkes, neuer caring to come at them, but are then moſt merrie, when their wiues are fartheſt off. If their wiues liue at home they will be abroad, mealing and lodging where their wiues ſhall not know: their owne houſe is as a priſon to them: they are not well, but when they are out of it. Of the like lewd conceit and practife are many wiues, who on no other occaſion then meere lightneſſe, being eager in purſuing their pleaſures, and ſatisfying their luſts, gad out of their owne houſes in the day, lie out of them in the night, and remaine in other company dayes and nights: or at leaſt are glad when their husbands haue occaſion to be from home; not vnlike to the light huſwife which Salomon deſcribeth, Prou. 7. 10. &c. I ſpeake of matters too famous, or rather infamous. I would there were no iuſt cauſe to taxe this lightneſſe. But let ſuch as deſire to approue themſelues to God or man, take heed of theſe hainous and more then heatheniſh vices. Though Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Iudah

               Too neere to the forenamed kinde of vnlawfull ſeparation Man and wifes fault in parting roomes and beds in the ſame houſe. doe they come, who though they liue both in one houſe, yet make that houſe by their eſtranging themſelues one from another as two houſes: the man abiding in one end thereof, his wife in another: and ſo haue their ſeuerall roomes, ſeuerall tables, ſeuerall ſeruants, all ſeuerall: Or if the ſtraitneſſe of their houſe will not ſuffer them ſo to part other roomes, yet they will haue ſeuerall bed-chambers, or at leaſt ſeuerall beds: ſo as they that ſhall call them bed-fellowes, ſhall but nicke-name them. Thus they rob each other of that due beneuolence which they mutually owe one to another, they expoſe themſelues to the deuils ſnares, they more and more eſtrange their

hearts one from another, and depriue themſelues of ſuch mutuall comforts and helpes, as by matrimoniall ſocietie they might afford to, and receiue from one another.
            
            
               §. 18. Of husbands and wiues mutuall prayers.
               
               The matter whereabout husbands and wiues mutuall prouidence ought to be conuerſant, is in generall the good of one another; that each of them doe that for the other, which Salomon in particular applieth to a wife, viz. good and not euill all 
                  
                     Prou. 31. 12. 
                  the dayes of their life. Now the good of man extendeth to his ſoule, bodie, good name, and goods.
               
               A generall dutie tending to the good of all theſe is prayer. 
                  Prayer a mutuall dutie. 1 Pet 3. 7. 
                  S. Peter requireth ſuch a cariage of man and wife one towards another, as their prayers be not hindred: whereby he taketh it for grant, that prayer is a mutuall dutie which one oweth to the other: which dutie Iſaak performed for his wife. Herein may 
                     Gen. 25. 21. man and wife be helpfull each to other in all things needfull to either of them: for it is the meanes which God in wiſdome 
                     Matth. 7. 7. I am. 5. 16. hath ſanctified for the obtaining of euerie needfull bleſsing for ourſelues or others. By many it is counted but a ſlight dutie and of ſmall vſe; but the truth is, that to performe it aright, in truth and faith, is both difficult in the deed, and powerfull in the effect. It is the beſt dutie that one can performe for another, and the leaſt to be neglected. We heard before, that Iſaak prayed for his wife: and to ſhew the good he did to her thereby, it is noted, that the Lord was intreated of him: ſo as ſhe, being 
                     Gen. 25. 21. 
                  barren before, by that meanes conceiued. All the phyſicke in the world could not haue done her ſo much good.

                     . Luke 18. 1. 
                  Alwayes therefore, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 1 Theſſ. 5. 17. 
                  without ceasing is this dutie to be performed. Whenſoeuer man and wife make any prayer, therein they muſt be mindfull of one another: yea and oft muſt they of purpoſe take occaſion to make prayers in ſpeciall one for another: and that both in abſence, and alſo in preſence of one another.
               This latter doth eſpecially concerne the husband, who is as a Prieſt vnto his wife, and ought to be her mouth to God when they two are together: yet I doubt not, but that the wife may pray in the husbands preſence when they two are alone, 
                     •
                  ither for triall (that he may haue knowledge of her abilitie and gift in that kinde) or for helpe (if the wife be much better

able to performe that duty then the man is, as many wiues are.) Not without cauſe therefore haue I reckoned this among common mutuall duties.
            
            
               §. 19. Of the things for which husbands and wiues are to pray alone.
               
               There are ſundry needfull bleſſings which husbands and wiues are to pray for that appertaine only to themſelues, and are moſt meet to be mentioned in priuate praier betwixt themſelues, as
               1. That as they two are one fleſh, ſo they may be alſo one ſpirit: that their hearts may be as one, knit together by a true, ſpirituall, matrimoniall loue: alwayes delighting one in another, euer helpfull one to another, and readie with all willingneſſe and cheerefulneſſe to performe all thoſe duties which they owe one to another.
               2. That their mariage bed may be ſanctified: and as it is by Gods ordinance, ſo it may remaine to them by their well vſing it, a bed vndefiled. There is no other thing, for which mutuall prayer in priuate betwixt man and wife is more needfull: and that ſo much the rather, becauſe of the naturall heat of luſt which is in moſt: which if it be not by prayer (the beſt meanes for that purpoſe) aſſwaged, it may proue a defilement 
                     Intemperans in coniugio quid aliud niſi quidam adulter vxoris eſt? Aug. ex Ambr. contr. Iulian. lib. 2. of the vndefiled bed: and man and wife become adulterers one to another. As other things, ſo this alſo is ſanctified by the word and praier. The word giueth a warrant and direction for the vſe of it: praier both ſeaſoneth it, and procureth a bleſſing vpon it.
               3. That they may haue children, and thoſe ſuch as may be heires of ſaluation, and liue in this world to their owne and others good: that they may be comely and well proportioned children: nor ideots in vnderſtanding, nor monſters in bodily ſhape, nor yet lewd and infamous in their liues: which could not but be a griefe to their parents, and might alſo open the mouthes of the wicked againſt them.
               4. That God would giue them competencie of this worlds goods, and other good meanes well to nouriſh, nurture, and place forth their children: and a ſufficiencie for the maintenance

of their family, and of that eſtate wherein God ſetteth them.
               5. That ſuch needfull gifts and graces as are wanting in either of them may be wrought: and ſuch vices and infirmities as they are ſubiect vnto may be redreſſed.
               Theſe and many other like things giue occaſion to man and wife in ſpeciall manner to pray one for another, and one with another.
            
            
               §. 20. Of husbands and wiues hatefull imprecations and wiſhes one againſt another.
               
               Contrary to that holy and heauenly dutie of praier are thoſe direfull and helliſh imprecations and execrations, which ordinarily doe paſſe out of the mouthes of many husbands and wiues againſt one another (and that many times for very light occaſions) curſing the day that euer they knew one another, and wiſhing that one of them had beene vnder the ground before they came together. Moſt odious are theſe and ſuch like execrations in any mans mouth, but more then moſt odious in the mouth of man and wife againſt one another.
               Many who for outward ſhame for beare to belch forth ſuch 
                     •
                  rotten ſtinking ſpeech, make ſmall conſcience of wiſhing the like in their hearts. If an husband be any whit harſh, and a wife ſhrewiſh: or if through ſickneſſe, or any other like occaſion they ſeeme burdenſome each to other: or if any diſlike of one ariſe in the heart of the other: or if their hearts be ſet vpon others: or if the ſuruiuor be to carry away the goods and 
                     •
                  ands, their hearts will be filled with a thouſand wiſhes of one anothers death. Yea, many times ſuch as haue very good huſbands or wiues, without any ſhew of reaſon (only through an inward corrupton of their heart, and malicious inſtigation of Satan, not taking notice of their owne good) are ready to wiſh they were in heauen: making thereby a pretence of their eternall bliſſe to whom they ſo wiſh, whereas indeed their only deſire is to be looſed and freed from them. God oft meets with ſuch wicked wiſhers (whereby he ſheweth how hatefull ſuch wiſhes are to him) for ſometimes according to their wiſh he taketh away good husbands and wiues from thoſe that are euill: and when they are gone he maketh their loſſe to be ſo

ſenſibly felt, as thoſe vngodly wiſhers doe, (as we ſpeake) in euery veine of their heart repent them of their raſh wiſhes. Yea, to aggrauate their wretchedneſſe the more, he giueth them ſuch crabbed and peruerſe husbands and wiues in the roome and ſtead of thoſe good ones (for ſeldome comes a better) as they are forced with many deepe ſighs and groanes to wiſh (but all in vaine) their former wiues and husbands Quam chara ſint carendo intelligunt. Cic. in Orator. aliue againe, and ſo to verifie the prouerbe, A good thing is not ſo well diſcerned by enioying, as by wanting it. Sometimes againe God in anger croſſeth their wiſhes, and firſt taketh away the wiſhers of others death: or elſe prolongeth the life of both to Amicitiae quid haberent voluptatis carendo magis intellexi quàm ſruendo. Idem in oration. poſt red. their greater vexation.
            
            
               §. 21. Of husbands and wiues neglect of mutuall praier.
               
               The very neglect of mutuall prayer in husbands and wiues for each other is alſo a ſinne contrary to the forenamed dutie of praier: whereof if all that are guiltie were as well knowne to man as to God, how many vnkinde husbands and wiues careleſſe of one anothers good would be noted, more then are? Rare are thoſe husbands and wiues, that haue their ſeaſons to pray alone together one with another, if euer they pray one for another. Though in outward complements they may ſeeme very kinde, and in the outward things of this world, very prouident, yet if they pray not one for another, they are neither kinde, nor prouident. Heartie, feruent, frequent prayer is the greateſt token of kindneſſe, and beſt part of prouidence that can be.
            
            
               §. 22. Of husbands and wiues mutuall care for one anothers ſaluation.
               
               From the generall dutie of praier which is profitable to all things, I come to the particular branches of man and wiues 
                     Admonendi ſunt coniuges vt exhortantes inuicem ſaluent. Greg. in Paſt. part. 3. Adm. 28. mutuall prouident care: and will firſt begin with that which is firſt to be ſought, the good of one anothers ſoule: which the Apoſtle intimateth to be a thing to be ſought after, where he ſaith, 1 Cor. 7. 16. 
                  What knoweſt thou, ô wife, whether thou ſhalt SAVE thine husband, or what knoweſt thou, ô man, whether thou ſhalt SAVE thy wife? 
                  1 Pet. 3. 1. 
                  S. Peter enioyneth wiues to doe their endeuour to win their husbands: and 
                     Epb. 5. 25. 
                  S. Paul ſetteth before huſbands

the patterne of Chriſts loue, which had eſpeciall reſpect Of the particular dutie of husbands in this reſpect, See Treat. 4. §. 47. to the ſoule and the ſaluation thereof: ſo as this is a mutuall dutie appertaining to them both, which S. Peter further implieth where he ſtileth them coheires of the grace of life.
               
               It is the greateſt good that one can poſſibly doe for another, to be a meanes of helping forward his ſaluation. And there is 1 Pet. 3. 7. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . nothing that can more ſoundly and firmely knit the heart of one to another, then to be a meanes thereof.
            
            
               §. 23. Of husbands and wiues care to win one the other, when one of them is not called.
               
               That the ſaluation of the ſoule may be the better effected, reſpect muſt be had to the preſent and particular eſtate of huſband or wife. If one be a beleeuer the other not, the beleeuer muſt vſe all the meanes that may be, to draw on the other alſo to beleeue. If both be beleeuers, their mutuall care muſt be to 
                     •
                  edifie one another in thier moſt holy faith.
               For the firſt, it is the maine drift of S. Peters exhortation to 1 Pet. 3. 1. beleeuing wiues, about their conuerſation, to draw on their vnbeleeuing husbands to the true faith. His phraſe (that they 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  may be wonne or gained) as in generall it hath reſpect to their ſoules ſaluation, ſo in particular to their firſt conuerſion. Now if this dutie appertaine to a wife, much more to an husband, who is appointed an head to his wife, and a Saniour. To this end doth S. Paul aduiſe beleeuing husbands and wiues that 
                     Eph. 5. 23. 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13 are maried to vnbeleeuers, to dwell with them.
               For what a wofull thing is it, that two which in this world A wofull thing that one fleſh ſhould be in heauen and hell. Luk. 17. 34. are ſo neerely linked together as to make one fleſh, ſhould in the world to come be ſo farre ſeparated one from another, as heauen is from hell. This indeed ſhall ſo fall out in many: for Chriſt hath expreſly foretold it, that of two that were in one 
                  
                     •
                  ed together (who are more fitly ſet forth vnder this phraſe then man and wife, who moſt vſually are ſtiled bedfellowes?) 
                     
                        •
                     ne ſhall be taken (to mercy and glory) the other ſhall be for ſaken or left to endleſſe and eaſeleſſe torture and torment.) But though it be foretold that thus it ſhall fall out with many a 
                     •
                  ouple, yet our care muſt be, and that with our vttermoſt power, Meanes of conuerſion the beſt cauſe of loue. to preuent it, as in our ſelues, ſo in our bedfellow.
               If it pleaſe the Lord to giue ſuch a bleſſing to the endeuour

of an husband or wife, as to be a meanes of the conuerſion of their bedfellow, then will the partie conuerted both intirely loue the other, and alſo heartily bleſſe God (as there is iuſt cauſe) that euer they were ſo neerely linked together.
               This dutie of winning one another, is to be applied to ſuch as are maried not only to plaine infidels, but alſo to Papiſts or other like Idolaters, to Atheiſts, or any other profane perſons, to heretiques, ſeparatiſts, ſchiſmatiques, or any that beleeue not aright.
            
            
               §. 24. Of husbands and wiues edifying one another.
               
               The ſecond dutie tending to the ſoules ſaluation is, that two beleeuers being maried together, they endeuour mutually to build vp one another more and more. 1 Theſſ. 5. 11 One Chriſtian oweth this dutie to another: much more man and wife. 
                     Heb. 12. 15. 
                  Take heed (ſaith the Apoſtle) that no man fall away from the grace of God. If no man, then nor wife nor husband.
               A ſpirituall edifying of one another is the beſt vſe which Spiritual edification a main end of matrimoniall coniunction. we can make (and ought to make) of thoſe 
                     Col. 2. 19. 
                  ioynts and bonds whereby we are knit one to another. By vertue of them 
                     Eph. 4. 16. 
                  the body (namely the myſticall body of Chriſt) receiueth increaſe to the edifying of it ſelfe, and 
                     Col. 2. 19. 
                  increaſeth with the increaſe of God. Now the bond of mariage being of all other the firmeſt, and that whereby we are neereſt knit together, by vertue of what bond ſhould we edifie one another, if not by vertue of the mariage bond?
               
            
            
               §. 25. Of husbands and wiues hindering ſinne one in another.
               
               Two things are requiſite vnto ſpirituall edification.
               One reſpecteth the hinderances of growth in grace.
               The other the helpes thereof.
               The hinderances of grace are all manner of ſinnes. Sinne to grace is as water to fire: it ſlaketh the heat of it, and if without hoe it be powred on it, it will cleane put it out. In regard hereof there ought to be a mutuall care in husbands and wiues, both to preuent ſinne before it be committed, and alſo to make what redreſſe they can after it is committed.
               That it is a mutuall dutie for husbands and wiues ſo much Man and wife to preuent ſin in one another. as they can, to preuent ſinne one in another is euident, by that reaſon which the Apoſtle vſeth, to keepe them from defrauding

one another, in theſe words, that Satan tempt you not. 
                  1 Cor. 7. 5. For out of the ſcope and matter of thoſe words, this generall doctrine may be gathered, Husbands and wiues ought to be carefull to keepe one another from the temptations of Satan, that is, from ſinne, whereunto all his temptations tend. 
                     Gen. 27. 6, &c.
                   
                  Rebekah performed the dutie of a good wife in keeping Iſaak from bleſſing Eſau: which if he had done, he had ſinned againſt 
                     Gen. 25. 23. Gods expreſſe word. Though ſhe failed in the manner of doing it, yet her end was good.
               As that loue they owe one to another, ſo that care which they By preuenting ſinne in each other, they keepe iudgements from themſelues. ought to haue of themſelues requireth as much, for ſinne prouoketh Gods wrath, his wrath ſendeth downe vengeance, that vengeance which falleth on the husband can hardly miſſe the wife, or that the husband, which falleth on the wife; and that by reaſon of their neere vnion: though it fall not on both their pates, yet it cannot but much affect, and euen afflict the partie that eſcapeth. The wiues of thoſe rebells who were 
                     Num. 16. 27, 32 ſwallowed vp quicke in the wilderneſſe, periſhed in like manner with their husbands. For they who are ſo neere as husbands and wiues, and doe not what they can to preuent one anothers ſinnes, make themſelues acceſſary thereto.
               For the better effecting of this dutie, husbands and wiues Direction for preuenting ſinne. muſt be watchfull ouer one another, and obſerue what ſinnes either of them are giuen vnto, or what occaſions are offered to draw either of them into ſinne. If either of them be cholericke or prone to be angry on a ſudden, the other muſt endeuour to take away all occaſions of offence: and if both ſhould be teſtie and haſtie to wrath, when the one ſeeth the other firſt moued, the partie whoſe paſſion is not yet ſtirred, ought the rather to be ſetled and compoſed to all meekneſſe and patience, leſt, if both together be prouoked, the whole houſhold be ſet on fire. If either of them be giuen to drunkenneſſe, couetouſneſſe, or any other ſinne, the other ought by wiſe and gentle perſwaſions to keepe them (as much as they can) from thoſe ſinnes. Yea they may alſo get others, that are diſcreet and able, to diſſwade them: or vſe what other good meanes they can to that purpoſe.
            
            
               
               §. 26. Of husbands and wiues redreſſing ſinne in one another.
               
               When either husband or wife is fallen into any ſinne, a mutuall dutie it is for the other, to vſe what redreſſe may be of that ſinne: as if one of them were wounded, the other muſt take care for the healing of that wound. Abigail performed 1 Sam. 25. her dutie in this kinde, when, after ſhe had heard what churliſh entertainment her husband gaue to Dauids ſeruants, ſhe haſtened to carry ſtore of prouiſion to Dauid, and humbled her ſelfe before him, and ſo moued Dauid to aſſwage his wrath: yea ſhe tooke a ſeaſonable time alſo to tell her husband his fault, and the danger whereinto he brought himſelfe thereby.
               More directly, and with better ſucceſſe did Iaakob redreſſe the ſuperſtition, or rather Idolatrie of his wife Rachel, as may

               A brother at large muſt not ſuffer ſinne to lie on his brother: 
                     Leu. 19. 17. much leſſe may husband or wife the one vpon the other.
               
                  Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother (ſaith the law) and ſuffer 
                  It is a branch of hatred to ſuffer ſin to lie on any. 
                  ſinne to lie on him. To doe this then is a token and fruit of hatred. If an husband ſhould ſee his wife, or a wife her husband lying in the fire, or water, ready to be burnt or drowned, and not afford their beſt helpe to pull them out, might they not iuſtly be thought to hate them? But ſinne is as fire and water, which will burne and drowne men in perdition.
               This dutie may be performed by meeke inſtructions, pithy perſwaſions, gentle reproofes: yea, and by the helpe of ſome

               Hitherto of preuenting, and redreſſing hinderances of grace. Hereunto muſt be added an helping forward of the growth thereof: which man and wife muſt mutually endeuour to effect one in another. The care which Elkanah had to carry his 1 Sam. 1. 4. &c.
                   wiues along with himſelfe vnto the Tabernacle of the Lord yeere by yeere, ſheweth that his deſire was to vphold them in the feare of God: yea the gifts and portions, which at that time he vſed to beſtow on them, implie the care that he had to

encourage them to hold on in ſeruing the Lord. It was without queſtion the maine end which the Shunamite aimed at in 2 King. 4. 10. prouiding lodging for the Prophet, that both ſhe and her huſband might be built vp in Grace.
               This duty may be the better effected by theſe means following. How growth in grace may be helped forward.
               
               1. By taking notice of the beginning, and leaſt meaſure of Grace: and approuing the ſame.
               2. By frequent conference about ſuch things as concerne the ſame: mutually propounding queſtions one to another thereabouts, and anſwering the ſame.
               3. By their mutuall practiſe and example: making themſelues each to other a patterne of pietie.
               4. By performing exerciſes of religion, as praying, ſinging pſalmes, reading the word, and the like together.
               5. By maintaining holy and religious exerciſes in the familie. 
                     Nemo magiſter ita perſuadere poterit quemadmodum vxor. Chryſ. hom. 19. 1 Cor. 7. Though this dutie eſpecially appertaine to the husband, yet the wife muſt put her husband in minde thereof, if he forget it; and ſtirre him vp, if he be backward: Thus did the good Shunamite, 2 King. 4. 9, 10. No mans perſwaſion in this kinde, can ſo much preuaile with a man as his wiues.
               6. By ſtirring vp one another to goe to the houſe of God, Maritum co adducito vt ſanctorum dierum rationem habeat. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp. to heare the word, partake of the Sacrament, and conſcionably performe all the parts of Gods publike worſhip.
               Great need there is, that husbands and wiues ſhould endeuour to helpe forward the growth of grace in each other, becauſe we are all ſo prone to fall away and wax cold, euen as 1. Great need thereof. water if the fire goe out, and more fewell be not put vnder. 2. Husbands and wiues may be very helpfull one to another therein. And of all other, husbands and wiues may be moſt helpfull herein, becauſe they can ſooneſt eſpie the beginning of decay by reaſon of their neere, and continuall familiaritie together.
            
            
               §. 28. Of the ſinnes of husbands and wiues contrary to a mutuall care of one anothers ſaluation.
               
               The vices contrary to that generall mutuall dutie of huſbands and wiues in procuring the Saluation of one another, and to the particular branches compriſed vnder it, are many: As
               1. A careleſſe neglect thereof: when as husbands and wiues 1. Care only for temporall things. ſo minde earthly things, as they thinke it enough if they be prouident one for another in the things of this life. Hereof

moſt that liue in this earth are guiltie: and among others, euen many of them who haue the name of very good and kinde husbands and wiues. But whatſoeuer the opinion of others be of them, the truth is, that if they faile in this point, they goe no further then the very heathen haue done, and their kindneſſe may be as the apes kindneſſe, which cauſeth death.
               2. The vnworthy walking, and vnchriſtian cariage of a beleeuer 
                  2. Vnworthy walking. 
                  that is maried to one that beleeueth not: hereby the vnbeleeuer is kept off from embracing the Goſpell, and made the more to diſlike and deteſt it. If a popiſh or profane husband be maried to a wife that maketh profeſſion of the truth of the Goſpell, and ſhe be ſtout, proud, wanton, waſpiſh, waſtefull, or giuen to any other like vices, will he not be ready thereupon to inueigh againſt the religion ſhe profeſſeth, and vtterly proteſt againſt it? So alſo a popiſh or profane wife, if ſhe be maried to ſuch an husband.
               3. Negligence in obſeruing one anothers diſpoſition or conuerſation: 
                  3. Negligence in preuenting ſin. whereby it commeth to paſſe that they keepe not backe, nor reſtraine one another from running into any ſinne: but proue ſuch husbands and wiues one to another as Eli proued a father to his ſonnes: whence it fell out, that Gods ſeuere vengeance fell vpon the necke of the one, and of the other. Pilats wife though an heatheniſh woman, ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt many ſuch wiues, for ſhe did what ſhe could to keepe 
                     Mat. 27. 19. her husband from ſhedding innocent bloud.
               4. Acomplement all ſoothing of one anothers humour, and ſeeking 4. Man-pleaſing. mutually to pleaſe one another in all things, without reſpect of good or euill. Such as theſe the Scripture termeth 
                     Eph. 6. 6. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  men-pleaſers. Hence it commeth to paſſe that husbands and wiues are ſo farre from drawing one another from ſinne, that the better rather yeelds vnto the worſe, and both runne into 
                     Diabolus ſaepe ſollicitus eſt ſubuertere viros per os coniugum. Orig. in Iob. lib. 2. euill, as Adam was perſwaded by his wife to tranſgreſſe againſt Gods expreſſe charge: and wiſe Salomon was drawne by his wiues vnto Idolatrie, 1 King. 11. 4. and Sapphira conſented to the ſacriledge of Ananias her husband, Act. 5. 2.
               5. An vndue feare of offending one another by Chriſtian inſtruction, 5. Vndue feare of offence. admonition, reproofe, and the like. Many who are oft

moued in conſcience to make knowne to their husbands and wiues the ſinnes wherein they liue, and the danger wherein they lie by reaſon thereof, doe notwithſtanding through careleſſe and cauſeleſſe feare, refraine and forbeare to doe ſo.
               6. An impious, and enuious diſpoſition, whereby many huſbands 6. Scoffing at the ſignes of grace. and wiues are moued to mocke, and ſcoffe at that holy zeale, and forwardneſſe which they obſerue in their bedfellowes: as Michal who reſembled Dauid to a foole, or 2 Sam. 6. 20. vaine-fellow, becauſe he manifeſted his zeale by dancing before the Arke. Thus doe many nip the worke of the ſpirit in the very bud, and cauſe grace ſoone to wither. But curſed be that husband, or wife, that thus peruerteth the maine end of their neere coniunction.
            
            
               §. 29. Of husbands and wiues mutuall care ouer one anothers body.
               
               After the good of the ſoule followeth the good of the body, wherein husband and wife muſt ſhew their prouident care each ouer other: and doe what lieth in them to procure the well-fare of one anothers perſon, and to nouriſh and cheriſh one anothers body. This dutie the Apoſtle layeth down vnder the compariſon of a body which he calleth fleſh, ſaying, 
                     Eph. 5. 29. 
                  No man hateth his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it: now man and wife are 
                     Eph. 5. 31. 
                  one fleſh. This dutie the Apoſtle in particular applieth to husbands. At the firſt inſtitution of mariage it was in particular applied to the wife, whom God made to be 
                     Gen. 2. 18. 
                  an helpe meet for man: ſo as it is a mutuall dutie appertaining to both. It ſeemeth that 
                     Gen. 27. 14. 
                  Rebecha was ſo carefull of Iſaak in this reſpect, that ſhe could readily make ſauory meat for him, ſuch as he loued.
               
               This dutie extendeth it ſelfe to all eſtates both of proſperity and aduerſity, of health and ſickneſſe: for ſo much doe they mutually couenant and promiſe when they are firſt ioyned together in mariage, I take thee (ſaith each to other) for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſſe and in health to loue and to cheriſh. Wherefore they ought mutually both to reioyce in the well-fare of one another, and alſo in all diſtreſſe to ſuccour and comfort each other, putting their ſhoulders vnder one anothers burden, and helping to eaſe one another

as much as they can. That which Salomon ſaid of a friend and a brother, may fitly be applied in this caſe to husband and wife, a friend loueth at all times, and a brother is borne for aduerſity, 
                  
                     Pro. 17. 17. that is, a truſty and faithfull friend is conſtant in his goodwill, and ready to performe all duties, of kindneſſe at any time, whether it be proſperity or aduerſity: the change of outward eſtate maketh no alteration in his louing affection and friendly cariage: yea he ſeemeth to be as it were borne and brought forth againſt the time of trouble and affliction, becauſe then is his prouident care and tender affection moſt manifeſted. Of all friends none ought to be more carefull, none more faithfull one to another then man and wife. How then ought they to loue at all times, and if any triall come to either of them, the other ſo to carrie himſelfe, as it may be truly ſaid they were ioyned together for aduerſity?
               Thus ſhall they verifie the truth of that whereby God was moued to creare of mankinde male, and female, namely that it was not good for man to be alone, but that it was rather good, 
                     Gen. 2. 18. that is, needfull, profitable, and comfortable for man and woman to be together. In which reſpect the wiſe-man ſaith, he that findeth a wife findeth a good thing; and by the rule of 
                     Pro. 18. 22. relation we may inferre, ſhe that findeth an husband findeth a good thing.
               
            
            
               §. 30. Of husbands and wiues backwandneſſe to helpe one another in time of need.
               
               Contrary to this duty is a certaine vnnaturall affection in ſundry husbands and wiues, who much grudge to prouide the things that are needfull for one another. The man commonly thinkes the charge too great, the woman thinkes the paines too much: they are affected one to another as if they were meere ſtrangers: nay many ſtrangers will be more ready to performe, and more cheerefull in performing needfull duties (as occaſion is offered) then ſuch vnnaturall husbands and wiues. If a little ſickneſſe, or other like croſſe fall on one of them, the other thinkes, neuer any had ſuch a burden; and by their diſcontent make the burden much more heauy then otherwiſe it would be: euen as when two oxen are in one yoke, and the one holdeth backe, the draught is made much

harder to the other. Thus doe they peruert one of the principall ends of mariage, which is to be a continuall comfort and 
                     Gen. 2. 18. 
                  helpe each to other, and to eaſe the burdens of one another: in which reſpect they are made yoke-fellowes. Iobs wife by her vnnaturall cariage towards him in his affliction 
                     Iob 2. 9. did much aggrauate his miſery: when he ſtood in moſt need of her helpe, ſhe afforded leaſt vnto him: it appeares by Iobs complaint of her, in theſe words, my breath is ſtrange to 
                  
                     Iob 19. 17. 
                  my wife, that ſhe altogether neglected him in his miſery. The common ſpeech of many after their husband or wife hauing long lien ſicke is departed, bewrayeth their vnnaturall affection: their ſpeech is this, if my husband (or wife) had died ſo much ſooner I had ſaued ſo much mony. What doth this intimate but that they could haue beene contented their husband (or wife) ſhould haue died ſooner that they might haue ſpared the more.
            
            
               §. 31. Of Husbands and Wiues mutuall reſpect of one anothers good name.
               
               The prouident care of husbands and wiues ought further to extend it ſelfe to the credit and good name of one another. As deare ought the good name of the wife be vnto the huſband, and of the husband to the wife, as their owne. 
                     Mat. 1. 19. The great regard that Ioſeph had of the credit of Marie his eſpouſed wife, made him thinke of putting her away priuily when 
                     •
                  e obſerued her to be with childe and knew not of whom: 
                     •
                  or he was not willing 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  to make her a publike example. The

                  Bethſheba to ſend ſecretly to Dauid, and 
                     •
                  ell him that ſhe was with childe. The commendation which he good husband (
                     Pro. 31. 28. 1. A good name is pretious. noted by Salomon) giueth of his wife being approued by the holy Ghoſt, ſheweth how man and wife 
                     ••
                  aght in that reſpect to honour each other: and that on good 
                     •
                  ounds. For
               1. A good name is a moſt pretious thing: 
                     Eccl. 7. 3. 
                  better then pre

                     oue great riches. 
                  2. The good name of the one is the honour of the other.
               
               2. So neerely are husbands and wiues ioyned together, the good name of the one cannot but tend to the honour

and credit of the other; ſo that herein they ſeeke their owne honour alſo.
            
            
               §. 32. Of husbands and wiues preuenting each others diſcredit.
               
               For direction herein, conſider we how this dutie may be Directions concerning a good name. 
                  performed, and how it may be manifeſted.
               
               For the better performing of it, care muſt be had both to preuent and redreſſe an ill name, and alſo to procure and preſerue a goodname.
               
               To preuent an ill name reſpect muſt be had of theſe three things following, 1. Preuent an ill name, and that
                  
                     1. What one relateth of another, and how.
                     2. What eare they giue to things related by others.
                     3. What cenſure they giue of one another.
                  
               
               For the firſt, husbands and wiues may in no caſe delight to 1. By concealing things of ill report. diſcouer vnto others, and ſpread abroad the infirmities, and imperfections of one another, or any thing that may tend to the diſcredit of either of them: but rather couer and conceale them as much as they may with a good conſcience. It is expreſſed that 
                     Mat. 1. 19. 
                  Ioſeph being a iuſt man laboured to conceale that blemiſh which he imagined to be in his wife, ſo as this may ſtand with iuſtice: yea alſo it is a part of Ioue, for 1 Pet. 4. 8. 
                  loue couereth a multitude of ſinnes.
               
               For the ſecond, husbands and wiues muſt not haue their 2. By cloſing eares againſt ill reports. eares wide opened to heare euery tale and report that ſhall be brought to one againſt the other, but rather ſhew themſelues diſpleaſed and offended with them that are ready to relate things of euill report. If an husband or wife manifeſt a willingneſſe to hearken after tales and reports of one another, the deuill will ſtirre vp inſtruments enow to fill their heads with tales, and thoſe for the moſt part both friuolous and forged: not only ſtrangers, but children, ſeruants, and they which are of the ſame family will euer be telling ſome tale or other, to currie fauour, as we ſpeake. But an vtter diſlike of ſuch flattering tale-bearers, will take away occaſion from them of telling vntrue, or ſlight reports.
               For the third, the iudgement and cenſure which husbands 3. By forbearing to cenſure raſhly. and wiues giue one of another muſt either be very charitable,

or verie ſparing. If one heare reported any notorious crime of the other, they may not be ouer-headie or haſtie to iudge and condemne, no though they thinke they ſee ſome euidence thereof, but rather ſuſpend their iudgement. This ſeemeth to be the minde of Ioſeph: though he obſerued Marie to be with 
                     Mat. 1. 19. childe, yet would he not preſently iudge her to be a notorious adultereſſe, or condemne her for an hypocrite, vnworthie to liue, and therefore would not make her a publike example.
               In briefe, that husbands and wiues may be the more ſparing in cenſuring one another, they muſt not raſhly beleeue any euill report of one another, but rather ſuppreſſe all light ſuſpitions as much as they can.
               That the iudgement which they giue one of another, may be charitable, in iudging they muſt well obſerue the properties of loue, which are 1. To interpret doubtfull things in the better part. 2. To mitigate, ſo farre as truth and iuſtice will ſuffer, the faults which are euident. Michal offended againſt 2 Sam. 6. 20. the firſt in an high degree, and was curſed. Abigail obſerued 1 Sam. 25. 25. the latter, and was bleſſed.
            
            
               §. 33. Of the wiſdome of husbands and wiues, in redreſſing one anothers ill name.
               
               To redreſſe an ill name, husbands and wiues muſt firſt giue one another notice of the report that goeth of them, and endeuour 2. Redreſſe an ill name. to worke in them both a ſight, and alſo a ſenſe of thoſe euils which are in the mouths of others: after notice giuen, they muſt labour to bring them to repentance of thoſe ſinnes, for which they are ill reported of, and to a manifeſtation of repentance, by doing things meet for repentance, which is by a zealous and conſcionable practiſe of ſuch vettues as are cleane contrarie to the vices for which they were euill ſpoken of. It may with good probabilitie be gathered out of the hiſtorie of the Leuite, whoſe wife plaid the whore, that thus he 
                     Iudg. 19. 1, 2, &c.
                   dealt with her. And thus Abigail endeuoured to deale with her husband. 1 Sam. 25. 37.

               To procure a good report, husbands and wiues muſt 3. Procure a good report. Firſt, take notice of the good qualities which are in one

another, and as one hath occaſion to ſpeake of the other, to make thoſe good qualities the ſubiect of their ſpeech: as we l Pro. 31. 28, 29. heard it before commended in the husband of that wife which is deſcribed by Salomon.
               
               Secondly, they muſt lend a willing and ioyfull eare to ſuch as ſhall (ſo farre as they can conceiue) truly and vnfainedly, without flatterie or hypocriſie, ſpeake any thing in commendation of the one or of the other: not thinking themſelues diſpraiſed (which is the conceit of many) when their bed-fellow is praiſed: but rather hauing their hearts the more enlarged to praiſe God, for beſtowing on them ſuch an excellent token and pledge of his fauour.
               Thirdly, they muſt imitate thoſe good things which they behold, or heare to be in one another, and ſo imitate them as they which haue before time knowne both husband and wife, may ſay, this ſhe learned of him, or this he learned of her.
            
            
               §. 35. Of husbands and wiues wiſdome, in preſeruing each others good name.
               
               To preſerue a good name, it will be meet for an husband or 4. Preſerue a good name. wife, wiſely and ſeaſonably to giue one another notice of that good fame which is raiſed of them, thereby to prouoke them both to giue glorie to God for the ſame (
                     Col. 1. 3, 4. as the Apoſtle thanketh God for that report which was ſpred abroad of the faith and loue of the Coloſsians) and alſo to walke worthie of that good report (as the Apoſtle who had giuen a great teſtimony of the bountie of the Corinthians, earneſtly exhorteth them to finiſh their beneuolence, leſt (ſaith he) I ſhould be aſhamed in 
                  2 Cor. 9. 4. 
                  this my conſtant boaſting.) For if they of whom there is once a good report raiſed, decay, wax cold, grow backward, or fall into notorious and ſcandalous ſinnes, they will cleane extinguiſh and put out their good name among men, and turne it into an euill report, according to that which Salomon ſaith, Dead flies cauſe the ointment of the Apothecarie to ſendforth a

               §. 36. Of husbands and wiues like affection towards one anothers credit.
               
               In the laſt place, to manifeſt a mutuall prouident care of one

anothers good name, husbands and wiues muſt be ſo affected with the report that goeth of either of them, as if the report were of their owne ſelues. If the report be good, to be glad thereof, and to reioyce thereat; if it be euill, to be grieued, and after an holy manner vexed at it: thus ſhall they ſhew a true ſympathie and fellow feeling of one anothers credit, according to that generall rule of the Apoſtle, 
                     Rom. 12. 15. 
                  Reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe.
               
            
            
               §. 37. Of the vices contrarie to that mutuallcare, which man and wife ſhould haue of one anothers credit.
               
               Vices contrarie to theſe duties concerning the good name of Contrarie vices. an husband and wife, are in generall two.
               One is a readineſſe to diſgrace and diſcredit one another, 1. To diſcredit each other, and that like Michal the wife of Dauid, of whom we heard before. A hatefull and deteſtable vice this is, which cannot ſtand with 2 Sam. 6. 20. true matrimoniall loue, but rather argueth an vtter diſlike, and a plaine hatred of one another.
               Husbands and wiues diſcredit one another, either by procuring an ill name, or hindring a good name.
               An ill name in procured by theſe meanes following.
               1. By blazing abroad one anothers infirmities: as when 1. By blazing one anothers infirmities abroad. tatling Goſsips meet, their vſuall pra
                     •
                  e is about their husbands, complaining of ſome vice or other in them: My husband, ſaith one, is couetous: I cannot get of him any thing almost: he maketh me goe as no body goeth. And my husband, replieth another, is ſo furious as none can tell how to ſpeake to him: ſo one after another goeth on in this tracke, ſome diſcouering ſuch infirmities as ſhould be concealed; others (which is worſe) plainly belying their huſbands. In like manner alſo husbands when they meet with their boone companions, make their wiues the common ſubiect of all their talke: one accuſing his wife of one vice; another his, of another. There are two reſpects for which this vice (moſt deteſtable in it ſelfe) is made more odious in an husband or a wife. 1. Becauſe they know more then any other of one anothers infirmities: ſo as if they be ſo euilly minded, they may much more diſcredit one another, then any other can. 2. Becauſe in regard

of their neere vnion they are moſt bound to conceale and couer each others imperfections. 
                     Gen. 9. 22, 25. 
                  Cam was curſed for reuealing his fathers nakedneſſe. but a more horrible curſe doe husbands and wiues deſerue, that ſo doe.
               2. By opening their eares, and giuing credit to euery light 2. By hearing and beleeuing others ill reports. report that any ſhall raiſe. More ſecret heart-burning of one againſt the other, and more open quarrels and contentions betwixt them, ordinarily ariſe from hence then from any other thing.
               3. By peruerting and miſ-interpreting one anothers actions, 3. By turning euerie thing to the worſt. words, yea and thoughts alſo: taking euery thing in the worſt part.
               4. By concealing from one another the common euill rumors 4. By concealing euill rumors. which are raiſed of them, and are in euery mans mouth: of all other, bedfellowes are moſt fit to diſcloſe ſuch things one to another: and moſt bound to doe it. Moſt fit, becauſe of their mutuall familiaritie: moſt bound, becauſe of their neere vnion.
               Many husbands and wiues doe hinder one anothers good 5. By enuying and gaineſaying good reports. name by enuying one at the good report that is made of the other, and gainſaying the ſame: as if the credit of the one muſt needs turne to the diſcredit of the other. Thus as water quencheth hot iron, ſo this enuious diſpoſition is a meanes to extinguiſh the heat of fame, and to put out the glorious light of a good name. Whereby as they impaire the credit and honour of one another, ſo they monſtrouſly diſcredit and diſhonour themſelues.
               The other generall vice in this kinde, is a careleſſe regard, 2. Neglect of each others fame. or plaine neglect of one anothers fame: when the husband is no way affected with any report that goeth of his wife, nor the wife with any of the husband: but as if they were meere ſtrangers one to another, they paſſe by all reports made of one another. What mutuall loue can there be in ſuch? howſoeuer their hands haue beene ioyned together, ſurely their hearts were neuer vnited, ſo as it had beene better they had neuer knowne one another, vnleſſe the Lord doe afterwards knit their hearts, and vnite their affections more neerely and firmely together.
            
            
               
               §. 38. Of husbands and wiues mutuall prouidence about the goods of the family.
               
               Yet there remaineth one thing more, whereabout husbands Treatiſe 3. §. 29. and wiues ought to manifeſt a mutuall prouident care each ouer other: and that is about the goods of this world. Howſoeuer the husband, while he liueth with his wife, hath the trueſt propertie in them, and the greateſt title vnto them, yet I referre this to thoſe mutuall duties which man and wife owe each to other, in three reſpects.
               Firſt, becauſe in conſcience they appertaine to the vſe of the wife, as well as of the husband.
               Secondly, becauſe the wife is by Gods prouidence appointed a ioynt gouernour with the husband of the familie, and in that reſpect ought to be an helpe in prouiding ſuch a ſufficiencie of the goods of this world, as are needfull for that eſtate wherein God hath ſet them, and for that charge which God hath committed to them.
               Thirdly, becauſe the wife, if ſhe ſuruiue the husband, ought to haue ſuch a portion of thoſe goods, as are meet for her place and charge.
               In theſe reſpects we ſee it requiſite, yea a bounden dutie, that husband and wife, euen in a mutuall regard one of another, be as prouident as they can be with a good conſcience in getting, keeping, and diſpoſing competent goods and riches for the mutuall good one of another. Concerning the huſbands dutie in this reſpect no queſtion is made: the practiſe of all good husbands mentioned in Scripture, the care of prouiding for their 1 Tim. 5. 8. See Treat. 4. §. 46. 
                  owne enioyned to them, their place and office to be their wiues head, with many other like arguments, whereof we ſhall more diſtinctly ſpeake, when we come to declare the particular duties of husbands, doe proue as much. The greateſt queſtion is concerning the wife, whether ſhe be bound to take any care about the goods. But if the Scripture be tho
                  
                     •
                  owly ſearched, we ſhall finde proofe enough to ſhew that euen 
                     •
                  he alſo is bound hereunto. For firſt, the generall end which God aimed at in making the woman (namely to be 
                     Gen. 2. 18. 
                  an helpe 
                  
                     •
                  o man) implieth as much: for herein may ſhe be a verie great helpe, as we ſhall ſee by and by in ſundry particulars. 2. That

generall property attributed to a wife to be 
                     Prou. 18. 22. 
                  a good thing, confirmeth as much: for that which is profitable is called good: and it is one reſpect wherein a wife is termed a good thing, that ſhe may by her prouidence and diligence bring much profit to her husband: and therefore in this, among other reſpects, the good wife which Salomon deſcribeth, is ſaid 
                     Prou. 31. 12. to doe good to her husband all the daies of her life: for by her induſtry and prouidence ſhee did ſo preſerue and increaſe his goods, that 
                     Verſ. 11. 
                  the heart of her husband truſted in her, and he had no need of ſpoile. If the particular actions whereby that good wife is deſcribed be well noted, we may eaſily obſerue that ſhe was an eſpeciall helpe vnto her husband, euen in his outward eſtate. From all which, we may inferre theſe two points. Firſt, that this prouident care about outward temporall goods is lawfull, not vnbeſeeming a Chriſtian man or woman. Secondly, that it is a mutuall dutie appertaining both to husband and wife.
               For the firſt, how needfull the goods of this world are for preſeruation of life and health, eſtate of the family, good of Church and Common-wealth, releefe of the poore, with the like vſes, no man can be ignorant. God hath giuen them as bleſſings to his children, and that often times in great abundance; and his children haue accordingly beene thankfull for them: ſo as a prouident care about them is not vnlawfull, but very expedient and needfull.
               For the ſecond, If there ſhould not be a ioint care herein, the care and paines of the one might be altogether in vaine. For ſuppoſe an husband be induſtrious, as 
                     Gen. 31. 40. 
                  Iaakob was, and get much abroad, if the wife either by her vnthriftineſſe, idleneſſe, negligence, or the like vices, ſuffer that which is brought home to be embeaſeled and waſted; or by her prodigalitie, brauerie, or loue of vaine companie, conſume it her ſelfe, where will be the profit of the husbands paines? Or on the other ſide, if a wife ſhould be as painfull and proſperous in getting, as 
                     Prou. 31. 10. &c.
                   the good houſwife before mentioned was, and the husband by carding, dicing, drinking, reuelling, or other like meanes ſhould waſte all away, what fruit would remaine of the wiues prouidence? In this mutuall prouident care of husband and wife, each of them muſt haue an eye to their owne place:

affaires abroad doe moſt appertaine to the man, and are eſpecially Externa negotia viro permitte. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp. to be ordered by him: that which the wife is eſpecially to care for, is the buſineſſe of the houſe: for the Apoſtle laieth it downe as a rule for wiues (as we ſhall hereafter more particularly declare) that they 
                     Tit. 2. 5. 
                  keepe at home, and 1 Tim. 5. 14. 
                  gouerne the houſe. By this means may they be very profitable each to other.
            
            
               §. 39. Of the vices contrary to the good prouidence of huſband and wife, about the goods of the family.
               
               Contrary to that dutie, are theſe vices following.
               1. Couetouſneſſe, and ouermuch care for themſelues: as Contrary vices. when an husband ſo raketh, and ſcrapeth, and hoordeth vp for himſelfe, as he neither affordeth vnto his wife ſo much as is 1. Couetouſneſſe. meet for her place while he liueth with her, nor thinketh of prouiding ſufficient maintenance for her, if ſhee ouer-liue him, but rather thinketh how to defraud her of that which the law caſteth vpon her. Or when a wife ſecretly hoordeth vp whatſoeuer ſhe can get, either by her owne induſtry, or elſe by purloining from her husband: ſometimes ſelling corne, wares, houſhold-ſtuffe, or other like commodities, ſo priuily as the husband ſhall neuer know it: ſometimes taking money out of his counter, box, bagge, cheſt, or the like, ſo as either it ſhall not be miſſed, or if it be, it ſhall not be knowne who had it. Many there be who in miſtruſt of their husbands prouidence, or in diſlike of them, or on ſome other by-reſpects, commit whatſoeuer they can get to the truſt and cuſtody of others, whereby it oft commeth to paſſe, that they themſelues, meeting with deceitfull friends, are vtterly defeated, euen becauſe they dare not make their fraud knowne. As Couetouſneſſe is in it ſelfe an odious ſinne; ſo it is made much more hainous by defrauding husband or wife, who ought to be as deare each to other as themſelues.
               2. Prodigalitie, and too lauiſh ſpending vpon themſelues, 2. Prodigality. and thoſe things which are moſt agreeable to their owne corrupt humor: as when husbands without any meane or mea
                  
                     •
                  ure, ſpend their goods abroad in hunting, hauking, carding, 
                     •
                  icing, eating, drinking, or the like, and ſuffer their wiues to want at home, and yet tooke their wiues to maintaine them, and therefore had their portion. Or when wiues bring their

husbands into debt, and weaken, if not cleane ouerthrow their eſtate, by gorgeous decking and adorning their houſes, by braue and coſtly apparell, by dainty fare, by goſſipping abroad, with the like. Many wiues are ſo violent herein, that if their deſire and humour be not ſatisfied, their husbands ſhall haue no reſt (forſooth they brought a portion, and maintained they muſt and will be; it skilleth not whether their husbands eſtate can beare it or no) in ſo much as many are forced wittingly, for quietneſſe ſake, to ſuffer their eſtate to ſinke. O fooliſh and wretched wiues! how little do they conſider that they were maried to doe their husbands good, and not euill all the daies of their life? is this to be an helpe to man? or rather is it not cleane to thwart Gods counſell, and peruert his purpoſe? can we thinke that God will forbeare, and not be auenged of them? yet much more will God be auenged of the forenamed husbands, becauſe of that image of himſelfe which he hath placed in them, and becauſe of that place and authority wherein he hath ſet them. The Apoſtle expreſly ſaith of them, that they are worſe then Infidels, which being ſo, they muſt looke for 1 Tim. 5. 8. the greater iudgement.
               3. Idleneſſe, and a careleſſe neglect of their eſtate. Many 3. Idleneſſe. men ſpend day after day, like a bird that flieth vp and downe, as it falleth out, from tree to tree, from twigge to twigge: they goe from place to place, but know not for what end: as they meet with any company, ſo they abide as long as the company tarrieth, and then ſeeke after other company, and are ready to goe with any to Ale-houſe, Tauerne, Play-houſe, Bowlingalley, or other like places. Many women alſo ſpend all the forenoone in lying a bed and tyring themſelues, and the afternoone as occaſion is offered in ſitting idly at home, or walking forth to little purpoſe, but only to weare out time, little regarding their husbands eſtate, whether it increaſe, or diminiſh. Thus by the idleneſſe and careleſneſſe of husband and wife, come faire eſtates many times to ruine, and both of then brought to penury and beggery.
            
            
               §. 40. Of husbands and wiues ioint care in gouerning the family.
               
               Hitherto I haue deliuered ſuch common duties as mutually

reſpect the husband and wife, and are to be performed of each to other. There are other common duties which they are both iointly bound to performe to other perſons: and thoſe either members of the family, or ſtrangers comming to the family.
               Concerning the members of the family, though there be ſome peculiar duties belonging to the maſter, and ſome to the miſtreſſe, ſome to the father, and ſome to the mother, of which we ſhall ſpeake in their due place; yet in generall the gouernment of the family, and the ſeuerall members thereof belongeth to the husband and wife both (if at leaſt they haue a family) and a ioint common dutie it is to be helpfull one to another therein.
               
                  Obiect. Seeing it is not neceſſarily required, that a huſband and wife ſhould haue a family to gouerne, for two may be maried and haue neither children nor ſeruants (as many are) and yet be true husband and wife; why is this care of a family ranked among the duties of husband and wife?
               
                  Anſw. 1. Becauſe ordinarily when two are maried they gather a family, and are the gouernours thereof: ſo as though it faile in ſome particulars, yet for the moſt part it holdeth.
               2. Becauſe the ioint gouernment whereof I ſpeake in this place is by vertue of the mariage-bond: for if a man and a woman ſhould liue together in an houſe, and by mutuall conſent haue a ioint authority and gouernment, this would be very offenſiue to all that ſhould know it, or heare of it: neither were they by any ordinance of God bound to be ſo helpfull one to another as husband and wife: nor the members of a family ſo bound to ſubiect themſelues to both.
               3. The duty whereof I ſpeake, though it be about the gouernment of a family, yet hath it reſpect to an huſband as he is an husband, and to a wife as ſhee is a wife; namely, that by vertue of their mariage-bond, and neere vnion, they be helpfull one to another in well-ordering the things of the family.
               Whether the man ought to look to the good gouernment of

his houſe is a queſtion without all queſtion. He is the higheſt in the family, and hath both authoritie ouer all, and the charge of all is committed to his charge: he is as a king in his owne houſe: as a king is to ſee that land well gouerned where he is king, ſo he that is the chiefe ruler in an houſe. The dutie which the Apoſtle applieth in particular to Biſhops & Deacons, in generall appertaineth to all husbands, 1 Tim. 3. 4. that they rule their owne houſe honeſtly: and againe, 
                     Verſ. 12. that they be ſuch as can rule their children well, and their owne houſholds. The care of many huſbands is in this reſpect commended in Scripture, as of 
                     Gen. 18. 19. 
                  Abram, of 
                     & 35. 2, &c.

                  Dauid, the 
                     Ioh. 4 53. Ruler at Galile, and of many other. That the wife alſo ought to be an helpe to him therein, is very euident: for the Apoſtle layeth it expreſly to their charge, 1 Tim. 5. 14. that they gouerne the houſe: would the Wiſe man haue ſo highly commended a wife 
                     Prou. 31. 11, &c.
                   for well gouerning her huſbands houſe if it had not appertained to her? It is very likely that wiſe Abigail had a great hand in gouerning Nabals houſe, becauſe the ſeruants made complaint to her of Nabals churliſhneſſe, and becauſe ſhe had the ſeruants at command, readily to doe what ſhe would haue them; yea alſo, becauſe ſhe could ſo readily prepare ſuch ſtore of prouiſion for Dauid and his men, as ſhe did. Hence is it that the wife is called Mater-familias. 
                  miſtreſſe of the houſe, as well as the husband Pater-familias. 
                  maſter of the houſe.
               
               
                  Obiect. 
                  1 Tim. 2. 12. 
                  A woman is not to teach, nor to vſurpe authoritie ouer the man.
               
               
                  Anſw. 1. That branch of teaching hath reſpect to publike aſſemblies, and Churches, in which ſhe may not teach: but not to priuate families, in which ſhe may, and ought to teach: for 
                     Pro. 31. 4. 
                  Barthſhebah taught Salomon. When 
                     Acts 18. 26. 
                  Apollos was brought to the houſe of Aquila, Priſcilla the wife of Aquila did helpe to expound to Apollos the way of God more perfectly.
               2. The other branch concerning authoritie, hath not reference to the inferiour members in the family, ouer which the wife of an houſhold gouernour hath authoritie, but only to the husband, ouer whom if ſhe take any authoritie, ſhe vſurpeth it. Therfore neither this place of Scripture, nor any other doth exclude the wife, being iointly conſidered with the husband, to rule & gouerne thoſe in the family which are vnder them both.
               
                  
2. Obiect. This ioint gouernment of the wife doth much impaire the dignity and authority of the husband.
               
                  Anſw. Nothing leſſe: for ſhe is ſubordinate to her husband, and muſt ſo rule others as ſhe be ſubiect to her husband, and not command any thing againſt his command, (prouided that his command be not againſt the Lord, and his word.) We ſee that in all eſtates the king or higheſt gouernour hath other Magiſtrates vnder him, who haue a command ouer the ſubiects, and yet thereby the kings ſupreme authoritie is no whit impaired, but rather the better eſtabliſhed, and he the more honoured. So is it in a family. 1. Reaſon. Husbands and wiues by their mutuall aſſiſtance bring great help one to another. Plus vident oculi quàm oculus. Ariſt. Polit. li. 3. c. 7.
               
               Let therefore husbands and wiues herein aſſiſt one another, for ſo they may be very helpfull one to another, and bring, by their mutuall helpe in gouerning, much good to the family. The husband by his helpe aiding his wife, addeth much authoritie vnto her, and ſo cauſeth that ſhe is not deſpiſed, nor lightly eſteemed. The wife by her helpe cauſeth many things to be eſpied, and ſo redreſſed, which otherwiſe might neuer haue beene found out: for two eies ſee more then one, eſpecially when one of thoſe is more at hand, and in preſence, as the 2. Reaſon. Many things in a family more fit for the one to meddle with, then for the other. wife is in the houſe.
               Beſides there are many things in well gouerning a family more fit for one to meddle withall then for the other: as for the husband to meddle with the great and weightie affaires of the family (as performing Gods worſhip, appointing and ſetling good orders, prouiding conuenient houſe-roome, and other neceſſaries for the family: keeping children when they grow

Yea further, as the man eſpecially is to performe the very actions of prayer, reading the word, catechizing, and other like duties in the family, ſo the wife may be a great helpe in putting her husband in minde both of the dutie it ſelfe, and of the time of performing it, and incouraging him to doe it, in gathering the family together, and exhorting them to be forward,

in making her ſelfe an example to the reſt by her diligent and reuerend attention, in oft vrging and preſſing to her children and ſeruants ſuch points of inſtruction as her husband hath taught; yea, in praying, reading, teaching, and performing like exerciſes her ſelfe, ſo farre as ſhe is able, when her huſband is abſent, or negligent and careleſſe, and will not himſelfe doe them; or it may be, is not able to doe them: or if ſhe performe them not her ſelfe, in getting ſome other to performe them.
            
            
               §. 41. Of the vices contrary to a ioint care of gouerning the family.
               
               The minde and practiſe of many, both husbands and wiues, Vices contrary. is contrary to this dutie.
               Many a husband becauſe the wiues office is eſpecially to 1. When huſbands put off all gouernment to their wiues. abide at home, will put off all gouernment to the wife: leauing it to her not only to order the things in the houſe, but alſo to bring in all needful things, to order and gouerne the children both young and old, yea euen to prouide for them alſo, to take in, to put out, to vſe all ſorts of ſeruants as pleaſeth her: yea, if ſeruants ſhall be ſtubborne and ſtout againſt her, he will take no notice of it, nor endure to be told of it, much leſſe afford her his aſſiſtance, but ſuffer her to be diſgraced and deſpiſed. As for religious duties, he will no way meddle with them. Oh baſe minded men, vnworthy to be huſbands and heads of wiues! ſhall your wiues who were made to be an helpe to you, haue no helpe from you, 
                     •
                  o not in thoſe things which eſpecially belong to your charge? ſhall the weaker veſſels beare all the burden? Aſſuredly as the man carrieth away the greateſt reputation and honour when a family is well gouerned (though it be by the ioynt care and wiſdome of his wife) ſo lieth he moſt open to the iudgement of God if the gouernment thereof be neglected, and through the neglect thereof, children and ſeruants grow impious: inſtance 1 Sam. 3. 12, 13. 
                  Elie, and 2 Sam. 15. 
                  Dauid. For as in a common-wealth, the greateſt honour of good gouernment, victorious battels, happy peace, and proſperity, and the greateſt diſhonor and dammage of the contrary, redoundeth to the king, ſo to the man who is chiefe gouernour in a family: for it is preſuppoſed, that all which doe any good are inſtruments of

the higheſt gouernour: if any euill or miſchiefe fall out, that it is through his negligence.
               On the other ſide, becauſe the husband is the moſt principall, 2. When wiues refuſe to adde their aide. many wiues thinke that the gouernment of the family nothing at all appertaines to them, and thereupon are careleſſe of the good thereof, and will not ſtirre their leaſt finger to order any thing aright: but, if any thing be amiſſe, lay all the blame on their husbands. Doe not ſuch peruert that maine end for which God made them, euen to be an helpe? Doe they not carrie themſelues moſt vnworthy of the place wherein God hath ſet them, namely to be ioynt-gouernours with their husbands, and partakers of their dignities? As by their negligence they make themſelues acceſſary to all the euill which falleth out in the family, ſo aſſuredly ſhall they haue their part in thoſe iudgements which are executed on the head thereof.
               Moſt contrary to the forenamed dutie is the practiſe of 3. When husbands or wiues are hinderances each to other. ſuch as are hindrances one to another in gouerning the family: as when wiues are not only negligent themſelues in comming to religious exerciſes, but keepe backe children and ſeruants, and ſo are a great griefe vnto their religious huſbands: or when they vſe any of the children or ſeruants to be inſtruments of iniquity; or are themſelues diſquiet and troubleſome in the houſe, like to her of whom Salomon ſpeaketh in this prouerbe, It is better to dwell in the corner of the houſe 
                  
                     Pro. 21. 9. 
                  top, then with a contentious woman in a wide houſe.
               
               Husbands alſo are oft an hinderance to that good gouernment which their wiues would helpe forward, when they ſcoffe and ſcorne at that good counſell which their wiues giue them for that purpoſe, or when they will not ſuffer their wiues to meddle with any thing at all, nor endure that they ſhould finde any fault, much leſſe take in hand to redreſſe any thing that is amiſſe. Theſe and ſuch like peruerſe diſpoſitions are in husbands and wiues, whereby it commeth to paſſe that they who were ioyned together to be a mutuall helpe each to other, proue heauy, yea intolerable burdens.
            
            
               §. 42. Of husbands and wiues mutuall helpe in hoſpitality.
               
               The next common duty of husband and wife reſpecteth

ſuch as come to their houſe, but are no particular members thereof, whether they be kindred, alliance, acquaintance, or ſtrangers, eſpecially if they be Saints, to whom 
                     Heb. 13. 2. Rom. 12. 13. 
                  hoſpitality, that is, a kinde and courteous entertainment, is due. Herein therefore muſt husbands and wiues be helpfull one to another: for as it is required of 1 Tim. 3. 2. husbands, ſo alſo of 
                     & 5. 10. wiues to be harborous, namely while they are maried, together with their husbands, and when they are widowes, of themſelues. 
                     Gen. 18 6. &c.
                   
                  Abraham and Sarah were herein an helpe one to another, when the three Angels in ſhapes of men came to their houſe: ſo were 2 King. 4. 8. the Shunemite and her husband when Eliſha the Prophet came to their houſe.
               For hoſpitality, that it is a commendable dutie belonging 
                     Reaſons. 1. Hoſpitality a commendable dutie. to ſuch as are houſe-keepers and able to giue entertainment, is euident by the precepts and examples before ſpecified, as alſo by the bleſſing which God thereupon hath brought to the houſes of them that were giuen thereunto, which the Apoſtle intimateth in theſe words, 
                     Heb. 13. 2. 
                  thereby ſome haue entertained Angels vnawares. Now therfore husbands and wiues being (as we haue heard) ioynt gouernours, as in other things, ſo in this they ought to lend an helping hand each to other, and that for theſe reaſons.
               1. Becauſe in giuing entertainment there are ſundry 2. The entertainment will be the better by a mutuall helpe. things to be done, whereof ſome are proper to the husbands place, and ſome to the wiues. To take order for the prouiſion of things without doores is more fit for the husband, 
                     Gen. 18. 7. 
                  Abraham did it: to order the ſmaller things within doores is more fit for the wife; that was left to 
                     Verſ. 6. 
                  Sarah.
               
               2. Becauſe it is meet that gueſts ſhould know they are welcome 3. Gueſts will be more cheerefull. both to the husband and to the wife, that ſo they may be the more cheerefull.
               3. Becauſe a mutuall conſent, and cheerefull help herein will 4. Mutuall loue will be more firme. be an eſpeciall means, as to manifeſt their mutuall affection, ſo to hold the hearts of man and wife firme and cloſe together, and make them the better like and loue one the other: eſpecially if the husband ſhall ſhew himſelfe as ready and willing to entertaine his wiues friends and kindred as his owne, and ſo the wife her husbands (as they ought.) For as they themſelues

are made one fleſh, ſo ought each of them to eſteeme of the others friends as of their owne.
               4. Becauſe thus they ſhew a mutuall deſire of bringing 5. A deſire of one anothers good manifeſted. Gods bleſſing on each other, and vpon their whole family.
            
            
               §. 43. Of vices contrary to mutuall helpe in hoſpitality.
               
               Contrary to this dutie is for the moſt part couetouſneſſe in the husband, and laſineſſe in the wife. The man, becauſe the charge of the family lieth on him, diſtruſtfully feareth leſt he ſhould want for his owne.
               I denie not but that a prouident care for our owne, & namely for them of the family, is needfull and commendable, 1 Tim. 5. 8. 
                  he that prouideth not for them is worſe then an infidell: ſo as a man may be ouerlauiſh in giuing entertainment, if he goe beyond his meanes, impoueriſh his eſtate, and diſable himſelfe to prouide for his owne, as many doe: yet when a man hath ſufficient, yea and abundance, when there is no iuſt cauſe, but meerely vpon an vndue feare too carkingly, and diſtruſtfully to pinch, and grudge to giue entertaiment to any, is vnbeſeeming a Chriſtian, yea alſo to be worſe then an infidell; not worthy to haue an houſe, or any thing fit for entertainment; no nor worthy of common ſociety.
               The woman on the other ſide grudgeth at the paines ſhe muſt take, and trouble ſhe muſt vndergoe about entertaining gueſts, and thereupon is loth that any at any time ſhould come to their houſe.
               Concerning a wife, I denie not but that an husband may be in this kinde ouerburdenſome to her, by being too ioueall, as they ſpeake, and bringing gueſts too often into the houſe, eſpecially if they be gueſts of no good name; and by that meanes make her euen weary of her life: but yet for a wife to refuſe all paines in that kinde, and to be diſcontented when her husband inuites any friends, or when any come (as the three Angels did to Abraham) vnawares, argueth not a louing affection, nor a wiuelike ſubiection vnto her husband, to be in her.
               Theſe faults are ſo much the greater when the husband, or wife, are free and forward in entertaining their owne kindred

and friends: but are backward, and grudge at the entertainment of each others friends and kindred. Hence commonly ariſeth much heart-burning of one againſt the other: yea much iarre and contention betwixt them: and from diſlike of the practiſe of one another in this kinde oft followeth a diſlike of one anothers perſon: ſo that as the fault is bad in it ſelfe, it proues to be much worſe in the miſchiefes that follow vpon it.
            
            
               §. 44. Of husbands and wiues mutuall helpe in releeuing the poore.
               
               The laſt common and ioynt dutie wherein husband and wife ought to be helpfull each to other, reſpecteth thoſe that are without the houſe, namely the poore, and ſuch as ſtand in need of their helpe, who are to be releeued and ſuccoured. Becauſe man and wife vſually meale together, and are ioynt partakers of Gods good creatures, they muſt put one another in minde of that precept of charity which was giuen to the Iewes when they were at their meales, 
                     Neh. 8. 10. 
                  ſend part vnto them for whom none is prouided. The good wife which is ſet forth by the holy Ghoſt for a patterne and example vnto others to follow, together with her husband, are noted to be helpfull one to another in this dutie: for ſhe is ſaid 
                     Pro. 31. 20. 
                  to ſtretch out her hand to the poore, and to the needy: and he is ſaid 
                     Verſ. 28. 
                  to praiſe her, thereby incouraging her to hold on in doing thoſe good things which ſhe did. What liberty the wife hath, or howfar forth ſhe may be reſtrained in caſe her husband vtterly refuſe to giue conſent, we ſhall 
                     Treat. 3. §. 23. 33. hereafter declare in the particular duties of wiues: the point here noted is, that both the huſband himſelfe muſt according to his abilitie be bountifull to the poore, and ſuffer his wife, yea prouoke her ſo to be, and withall allow her wherewithall to be bountifull: and that the wife alſo muſt ſtirre vp her husband to liberalitie in this reſpect, and her ſelfe open her hand to the poore in the things which lawfully ſhe may giue.
               There is nothing wherby a man or wife can bring more profit to the houſe, then by giuing to the poore: that which is giuen

to the poore is 
                     Prou. 19. 17. 
                  lent to the Lord, and he will repay it with great increaſe: it is as 2 Cor. 9. 6. 
                  ſeed, which being liberally ſowen, will bring forth a plentifull harueſt: yea, it is a meanes to make vs 
                     Luke 16. 9. 
                  friends, to ſpeake a good word for vs at the barre of Chriſts iudgement ſeat: and it bringeth not only the 
                     Iob 29. 13. & 31. 20. 
                  bleſſing of men, but 
                     Matth. 5. 7. 
                  of God alſo, euen the greateſt bleſsing of all, the 
                     Mat. 25. 34. bleſsing of eternall life: for it is 
                     Heb. 13. 16. 
                  a ſacrifice with which God is well pleaſed. The Apoſtle noteth this to be one of Chriſts oracles, which by word of mouth he left vnto his Diſciples, 
                     Acts 20. 35. 
                  It is more bleſſed to giue then to receiue.
               
               Beſides, husbands and wiues in diſtributing almes, may receiue 2. Husband and wife in place to giue good direction one to another. good direction one from another: the husband by telling the wife who are fit to be releeued (for commonly huſbands better know thoſe which are abroad out of the family) the wife by telling the husband what things are fitteſt to be giuen away: for wiues commonly know of what things there is greateſt ſtore, and what may in the houſe be beſt ſpared.
            
            
               §. 45. Of husbands and wiues vnmercifulneſſe to the poore.
               
               Contrarie is the vnmercifulneſſe of many husbands, who Vices contrarie. are not only hard-hearted themſelues (neuer giuing any thing vnleſſe by the law of the land they be forced, & then they part 1. Vnmercifulneſſe of the husband. with that which is giuen, ſo grudgingly, as it is nothing at all acceptable to God (for 2 Cor. 9. 7. 
                  God loueth a cheerfull giuer) but alſo tie their wiues hands, and ſuffer them to giue nothing. Wherein 2. Binding his wiues hands. they bring both the cry of the poore, and alſo the groanes and griefe of a mercifull wife who is thus reſtrained, vpon their owne necks, and aggrauate their ſinne in an high degree.
               On the other ſide, the vnmercifulneſſe of many wiues is alſo contrarie to the forenamed dutie: for there are many, who though they haue libertie to giue of the common goods, and alſo allowance of their owne out of which they may giue, yet couetouſly hoord vp all they can get, giue not a pennies worth, out rather ſuffer victuals and other things to periſh in the houſe, and when they are naught to fling them away, then that any thing whilſt it is good ſhould be giuen out of the houſe. Shall not the creatures which are ſpoiled in an houſe,

and the poore that haue wanted, make a loud crie in the eares Read Iam. 5. 1, 2. &c.
                   of the Lord againſt them? Yea further, many wiues are grieued at their husbands bountie, and ſtill mouing him to ſhut his hand, and giue no more. Are they not plaine deuils herein, oppoſing againſt that which is good?
            
         
         
            
            
               The third Treatiſe. Of wiues particular duties.
            
               §. 1. Of the generall heads of this treatiſe.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 22.
                  Wiues ſubmit your ſelues vnto your owne husbands as vnto the Lord.
                  Verſ. 23. For the husband is the head of the wife, euen as Chriſt is the head of the Church: and he is the Sauiour of the bodie.
                  
                  Verſ. 24. Therefore as the Church is ſubject to Chriſt, ſo let wiues be ſubiect to their husbands in euerie thing.
                  
               
               
                  IN the particular declaration of wiues duties, the Apoſtle noteth two points,

                     1. The dutie required.
                     2. The reaſon to enforce it.
                  
               
               In ſetting forth the dutie, he declareth

                     1. The matter wherin it conſiſteth.
                     2. The manner how it is to be performed.
                  
               
               In the matter we may note,

                     1. The thing required, 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        ſubiection.
                     
                     2. The perſon whom it reſpecteth, their 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        owne husbands.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        The manner reſpecteth,
                        1. The qualitie
                        
                        of that ſubiection.
                     
                     
                        2. The extent
                        
                         
                         
                     
                  
               
               
                  
To declare the qualitie of wiues ſubiection to their huſbands, two rules are ſet downe.
               1. That it be ſuch a ſubiection, as As vnto the Lord. ſhould be performed to Chriſt.
               2. That it be ſuch a ſubiection as the As the Church is ſubiect to Chriſt. Church performeth vnto Chriſt.
               The extent of wiues ſubiection doth ſtretch it ſelfe verie farre, euen to 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , In euerie thing. 
                  all things.
               
               The reaſon to enforce all theſe points is taken from that place of eminencie and authoritie, wherein the husband is ſet aboue his wife: which is,
               1. Propounded vnder the metaphor of an head (for the huſband is the head of the wife.)

               In which reſemblance two points are noted.
               1. That the husband, by vertue of his place, carrieth the verie image of Chriſt (euen as Chriſt is the head of the Church.)
               
               2. That the husband by vertue of his office is a protector of his wife (and he is the ſauiour of the body.)

                  ſubiection in generall.
               
               The firſt point to be handled in the treatiſe of wiues particular duties is the generall matter of all (Subiection) vnder which all other particulars are compriſed, for it hath as large 
                     Maritum habere Dominum meruit mulieris culpa, quod tamen niſi ſeruetur, deprauabitur ampliùs natura, & augebitur culpa. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. lib. 11. c. 37. Ante peccatum non aliter factam fuiſſe decet credere mulierem niſi vt vir ei dominaretur. Ibid.
                   an extent as that Honour which is required in the firſt commandement, being applied to wiues. When firſt the Lord declared vnto woman her dutie, he ſet it downe vnder this phraſe, Thy deſire ſhall be ſubiect to thine husband, Gen. 3. 16.
               
                  
                     Obiect. That was a puniſhment inflicted on her for her tranſgreſſion?
                  
                     Anſw. And a law too, for triall of her obedience, which if it be not obſerued, her nature will be more depraued, and her fault more increaſed. Beſides, we cannot but thinke that the woman was made before the fall, that the man might rule ouer her. Vpon this ground the Prophets and Apoſtles haue oft vrged the ſame. Sarah is commended for this, that ſhe was ſubiect to her husband (1. Pet. 3. 6.) Hereby the holy Ghoſt would teach wiues, that Subiection ought to be as ſalt to ſeaſon

euery dutie which they performe to their husband. Their very opinion, affection, ſpeech, action, and all that concerneth the husband, muſt ſauour of ſubiection. Contrary is the diſpoſition of many wiues, whom ambition hath tainted and corrupted within and without: they cannot endure to heare of ſubiection: they imagine that they are made ſlaues thereby. But I hope partly by that which hath beene before deliuered concerning thoſe common duties which man and wife doe mutually owe each to other, and partly by the particulars which vnder this generall are compriſed, but moſt eſpecially 
                        Quem vocavit ad culpam mulier, iuſtum eſt vt eum gubernatorem aſſuma
                              •
                           , ne iterum foeminea facilitate labatur. Ambr. Hexaem. l. 5. c. 7. by the duties which the husband in particular oweth to his wife, it will euidently appeare, that this ſubiection is no ſeruitude. But were it more then it is, ſeeing God requireth ſubiection of a wife to her husband, the wife is bound to yeeld it. And good reaſon it is that ſhe who firſt drew man into ſin, ſhould be now ſubiect to him, leſt by the like womaniſh weakneſſe ſhe fall againe.
               
            
            
               §. 3. Of an husbands 
                  Treat. 4. §. 6, 7. 
                  ſuperioritie ouer a wife, to be acknowledged by a wife.
               
               The ſubiection which is required of a wife to her husband implieth two things.

                     1. That ſhe acknowledge her husband to be her ſuperiour.
                     2. That ſhe reſpect him as her ſuperiour.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        That acknowledgement of the husbands ſuperioritie is twofold,
                        1. Generall of any husband.
                     
                     
                        2. Particular of her owne husband.
                         
                     
                  
               
               The generall is the ground of the particular: for till a wife be informed that an husband, by vertue of his place, is his wiues ſuperiour, ſhe will not be perſwaded that her owne huſband is aboue her, or hath any authoritie ouer her.
               Firſt therefore concerning the generall, I will lay downe Proofes that the husband is aboue the wife ſome euident and vndeniable proofes, to ſhew that an husband is his wiues ſuperiour, and hath authoritie ouer her. The proofes are theſe following.
               1. God of whom, 
                     Rom. 13. 1. 
                  the powers that be ordained, are, hath power to place his Image in whom he will, and to whom God giueth ſuperioritie and authority, the ſame ought to be acknowledged

to be due vnto them. But God ſaid of the man to the woman, he ſhall rule ouer thee, (Gen. 3. 16.)
               2. Nature hath placed an eminencie in the male ouer the 
                     Mari & foeminae ae natura tribuium eſt, vt hi, praeſit, illa obediat, cum mas praeſtantior ſit. Ariſt. Pol. lib. 1. female: ſo as where they are linked together in one yoake, it is giuen by nature that he should gouerne, ſhe obey. This did the heathen by light of nature obſerue.
               3. The titles and names, whereby an husband is ſet forth, doe implie a ſuperiority and authority in him, as

               5. The circumſtances noted by the holy Ghoſt at the womans creation implie no leſſe, as that ſhe was created after man, for mans good, and out of mans ſide, (Gen. 2. 18, &c.)
               6. The very 
                     Sicapilli pro velamine dati ſunt, qua gratia aliud addendū eſt velamen? Vt non tantum natura, ſed etiam voluntate ſubiectam ſe eſſe confiteatur. Chryſ. in 1 Cor. hom. 26. attire which nature and cuſtome of all times and places haue taught women to put on, confirmeth the ſame: as long haire, vailes, and other couerings ouer the head: this and the former argument doth the Apoſtle himſelfe vſe to this very purpoſe, 1 Cor. 11. 7, &c.
               
               The point then being ſo cleere, wiues ought in conſcience to acknowledge as much: namely that an husband hath ſuperiority 1. Wiues muſt acknowledge a ſuperioritie in husbands. and authoritie ouer a wife. The acknowledgement hereof is a maine and principall dutie, and a ground of all other duties. Till a wife be fully inſtructed therein and truly perſwaded thereof, no dutie can be performed by her as it ought: for ſubiection hath relation to ſuperioritie and authoritie. The very notation of the word implieth as much. How then can ſubiection be yeelded, if husbands be not acknowledged ſuperiors? It may be forced, as one King conquered in battell by another, may be compelled to yeeld homage to the conqueror, but yet becauſe he ſtill thinketh with himſelfe, that he is no whit inferiour, he will hardly be brought willingly to yeeld a ſubiects dutie to him, but rather expect a time when he may free himſelfe and take reuenge of the conqueror.
            
            
               
               §. 4. Of a fond conceit, that husband and wife are equall.
               
               Contrary to the forenamed ſubiection is the opinion of many wiues, who thinke themſelues euery way as good as their husbands, and no way inferiour to them.
               The reaſon whereof ſeemeth to be that ſmall inequalitie Of all that are inferiours, the wife commeth neereſt to a paritic. which is betwixt the husband and the wife: for of all degrees wherein there is any difference betwixt perſon and perſon, there is the leaſt diſparitie betwixt man and wife. Though the man be as the head, yet is the woman as the heart, which is the moſt excellent part of the body next the head, farre more excellent then any other member vnder the head, and almoſt equall to the head in many reſpects, and as neceſſary as the head. As an euidence, that a wife is to man as the heart to the head, ſhe was at her 
                     Gen. 2. 21. firſt creation taken out of the ſide of man where his heart lieth; and though the woman was at firſt 1 Cor. 11. 12. 
                  of the man created out of his ſide, yet is the man alſo by the woman. Euer ſince the firſt creation man hath beene borne and brought forth out of the womans wombe: ſo as neither the man is without the woman, nor the woman without the man: yea, as 
                  1 Cor. 7. 4. Cùm de pudicitia ſermonem habet, magna paritas. Chryſ. hom. 19. in 1 Cor. 7. 
                  the wife hath not power of her owne body, but the husband, ſo the husband hath not power of his owne body, but the wife. They are alſo 1 Pet. 3. 7. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  heires together of the grace of life. Beſides, wiues are mothers of the ſame children, whereof their husbands are fathers (for God ſaid to both, 
                     Gen. 1. 28. 
                  multiplie and increaſe) and miſtreſſes of the ſame ſeruants whereof they are maſters (for Sarah is called 
                     & 16. 4. Obiect. Anſw.
                   
                  miſtreſſe) and in many other reſpects there is a common equitie betwixt husbands and wiues; whence many wiues gather that in all things there ought to be a mutuall equalitie.
               But from ſome particulars to inferre a generall is a very weake argument.
               1. Doth it follow, that becauſe in many things there is a common equitie betwixt Iudges of Aſſiſe, Iuſtices of peace, and Conſtables of townes, that therefore there is in all things an equalitie betwixt them?
               2. In many things there is not a common equitie: for the husband may command his wife, but not ſhe him.
               3. Euen in thoſe things wherein there is a common equity,

there is not an equality: for the husband hath euer euen in all things a ſuperioritie: as if there be any difference euen in the forenamed inſtances, the husband muſt haue the ſtroake: as in giuing the name of Rachels youngeſt childe, where the wife would haue one name, the husband another, that name which the husband gaue, ſtood, (Gen. 35. 18.)
               Though there ſeeme to be neuer ſo little diſparitie, yet God hauing ſo expreſly appointed ſubiection, it ought to be acknowledged: and 
                     Poſſunt coniuges per charitatem ſeruire inuicem, ſed mulierem non permittit Apoſtolus dominari in virum. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. l. 11. c. 37. though husband and wife may mutually ſerue one another through loue: yet the Apoſtle ſuffereth not a woman to rule ouer the man.
            
            
               §. 5. Of a wiues acknowledgement of her 
                  Treat. 4 §. 9. 
                  owne husbands ſuperioritie.
               
               The truth and life of that generall acknowledgement of husbands honour, conſiſteth in the particular application therof vnto their owne proper husbands.
               The next dutie therefore is, that wiues acknowledge their All wiues muſt acknowledge their owne husbands worthy of honour. 
                  owne husbands, euen thoſe to whom by Gods prouidence they are ioyned in mariage, to be worthy of an husbands honour, and to be their ſuperiour: thus much the Apoſtle intendeth by that particle of reſtraint (
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  owne) which he vſeth very often: ſo likewiſe doth 1 Pet. 3. 1, 5. 
                  S. Peter, exhorting wiues to be in ſubiection 1 Cor. 7. 2. to their owne husbands: and hereunto reſtraining the commendation of the ancient good wiues, that they were in ſubiection to their owne husbands.
               
                  
                     Obiect. What if a man of meane place be maried to a woman of eminent place, or a ſeruant be maried to his miſtreſſe, or an aged woman to a youth, muſt ſuch a wife acknowledge ſuch an husband her ſuperiour?
                  
                     Anſw. Yea verily: for in giuing her ſelfe to be his wife, and Wiues inferiour to thoſe ouer whom they were before mariage. taking him to be her husband, ſhe aduanceth him aboue herſelfe, and ſubiecteth her ſelfe vnto him. It booteth nothing what either of them were before mariage: by vertue of the matrimoniall bond the husband is made the head of his wife, though the husband were before mariage a very begger, and of meane parentage, and the wife very wealthy and of a noble ſtocke; or though he were her prentiſe, or bondſlaue; which alſo holdeth in the caſe betwixt an aged woman and a youth:

for the Scripture hath made no exception in any of thoſe caſes.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. But what if a man of lewd and beaſtly conditions, as a drunkard, a glutton, a profane ſwaggerer, an impious ſwearer, and blaſphemer, be maried to a wife, ſober, religious Matron, muſt ſhe account him her ſuperiour, and worthy of an husbands honour?
                  
                     Anſw. Surely ſhe muſt. For the euill qualitie and diſpoſition Subiection due to huſbands of euill qualities. of his heart and life, doth not depriue a man of that ciuill honour which God hath giuen vnto him. Though an husband in regard of euill qualities may carrie the Image of the deuill, yet in regard of his place and office he beareth the 
                        •
                     mage of God: ſo doe Magiſtrates in the common-wealth, Miniſters in the Church, parents and maſters in the familie. Note for our preſent purpoſe, the exhortation of S. Peter to Chriſtian wiues which had infidell husbands, 1 Pet 3. 1, 2. 
                     Be in ſubiection to them: let your conuerſation be in feare. If Infidels carrie 
                        •
                     ot the deuils Image, and are not, ſo long as they are Infidels, 
                        •
                     aſſals of Satan, who are? yet wiues muſt be ſubiect to them, and feare them.
               
            
            
               §. 6. Of wiues denying honour to their owne husbands.
               
               Contrary thereunto is a very peruerſe diſpoſition in ſome A peruerſe opinion to thinke other husbands worthy of honour, and not their owne. wiues, who thinke they could better ſubiect themſelues to any husband, then their owne. Though in generall they acknowledge that an husband is his wiues ſuperiour, yet when the application commeth to themſelues they faile, and cannot be brought to yeeld, that they are their husbands inferiours. This is a vice worſe then the former. For to acknowledge no husband to be ſuperiour ouer his wife, but to thinke man and wife in all things equall, may proceed from ignorance of hinde, and error of iudgement. But for a wife who knoweth and acknowledgeth the generall, that an husband is aboue his wife, to imagine that ſhe her ſelfe is not inferiour to her huſband, ariſeth from monſtrous ſelfe-conceit, and intolerable 
                     •
                  rrogancy, as if ſhe her ſelfe were aboue her owne ſex, and 
                     •
                  ore then a woman.
               Contrary alſo is the practiſe of ſuch See Treat. 2. part. 1. §. 9. women, as purpoſely 
                     •
                  ary men of farre lower ranke then themſelues, for this very

end, that they may rule ouer their owne husbands: and of others who being See Ibid.
                   aged, for that end mary youths, if not very boyes. A minde and practiſe very vnſeemely, and cleaneth warting Gods ordinance. But let them thinke of ruling 
                     Indecens eſt vt mulier magiſtra viri fiat. Orig. in Iſa. hom. 7. what they liſt, the truth is, that they make themſelues ſubiects both by Gods law and mans: of which ſubiection ſuch wiues doe oft feele the heauieſt burden. Salomon noteth this to be one of the things for which the earth is diſquieted, when 
                  
                     Prou. 30. 21, 22. 
                  a ſeruant reigneth. Now when can a ſeruant more dominere, then when he hath maried his miſtreſſe? As for aged women who are maried to youths, I may ſay (as in another caſe it was ſaid) woe to thee ô wife whoſe husband is a childe. Vnmeet it is 
                     Eccle. 10. 16. that an aged man ſhould be maried to a young maid, but much more vnmeet for an aged woman to be maried to a youth.

                        A wiue-like reſpect of her huſband conſiſteth in two points:
                        1. Reuerence.

                        The reuerence which ſhe oweth to him is Wiue-like feare.
                        
                        1. Inward.
                     
                     
                        2. Outward.
                         
                     
                  
               
               Inward reuerence is an awfull reſpect which a wife in her heart hath of her husband, eſteeming him worthy of all honour for his place, and office ſake, becauſe he is her husband. Doubtleſſe Sarah had in her heart a reuerend reſpect and honourable eſteeme of her husband, when 
                     Gen. 18. 12. being alone, and thinking of him in her very thought ſhe gaue him this title Lord. This inward reuerence the Scripture compriſeth vnder this word Feare: as where our Apoſtle ſaith,

                  S. Peter exhorteth wiues to haue their conuerſation in Feare. It is no ſlauiſh feare of her husband which ought to poſſeſſe the heart of a wife, dreading blowes, frownes, ſpightfull words, or the like; but ſuch an awfull reſpect of him as maketh her (to vſe the Apoſtles word) 1 Cor. 7. 34. 
                  care how ſhe may pleaſe him. This wiue-like Feare is manifeſted

by two effects: one is Ioy, when ſhe giueth contentment to her husband, and obſerueth him to be pleaſed with that which ſhe doth: the other is griefe, when he is iuſtly offended and grieued, eſpecially with any thing that ſhe her ſelfe hath done.

For according to ones inward affection and diſpoſition will the outward action and conuerſation be framed. 2 Sam. 6. 16.

Wherefore after the iudgement of a wife is rightly informed of an husbands ſuperioritie, and her will perſwaded to account her owne husband her head and guide, it is very needfull that her heart and affection be accordingly ſeaſoned with the ſalt of good reſpect, and high eſteeme, which breedeth feare: and that thus her heart may be ſeaſoned, ſhe ought oft and ſeriouſly to meditate of his place and office, and of that honour which the Lord by vertue thereof hath planted in him. And if he haue gifts worthie his place, as knowledge, wiſdome, pietie, temperance, loue, and the like, ſhe ought to take notice thereof, and to thinke him worthie of double honour.

               Contrary to this inward reuerence of the heart is a baſe and wile eſteeme which many haue of their husbands, thinking no better of them then of other men; nay worſe then of others; deſpiſing their husbands in their heart, like Michal, of whom we heard before. This, as it is in it ſelfe a vile vice, ſo is

From vniuſt ſuſpicions. and ſuſpicions, ſuſpecting many euill things of their husbands whereof they are no way guiltie, and miſinterpreting, and peruerting things well done, as 2 Sam. 6. 20.

               For redreſſe of this enormous vice, wiues ought firſt in regard How wiues may redreſſe a light eſteeme of their huſbands. of themſelues to purge out of their hearts pride, and ſelfe-conceit, thinking humbly and lowly of themſelues, and that euen in regard of their ſex and the weakneſſe thereof: and if the Lord haue endued them with any gift aboue the ordinary ſort of women, to note well their owne infirmities, and to lay them by their eminent gifts: thus by looking on their blacke feet, their proud-peacock-feathers may be caſt downe. Yea alſo when they behold any infirmities in their husbands, they ought to reflect their eies on their owne infirmities, which it may be are euen as many and as grieuous, if not more in number, and more hainous in their nature and kinde: at leaſt let them conſider that they are ſubiect to the ſame, if God leaue them to the ſway of their owne corruption.
               Secondly, wiues ought in regard of their husbands to ſurmize no euill whereof they haue not ſure proofe and euidence: but rather interpret euery thing in better part: and follow the rule of loue, 1 Cor. 13. 7. 
                  which beareth all things, beleeueth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. If they note any defects of nature, and deformity of body, or any enormous and notorious vices

in their husband, then ought they to turne their eies and thoughts from his perſon to his place, and from his vicious qualities to his honourable office (which is to be an husband) and this will abate that vile eſteeme which otherwiſe might be occaſioned from the forenamed meanes.

               A wiues outward reuerence towards her husband is a manifeſtation of her inward due reſpect of him.

               For the firſt, that a reuerend geſture & carriage of her ſelfe to A wiues reuerence in her geſture. her husband, and in her husbands preſence, beſeemeth a wife, was of old implied by the vaile which the woman vſed to put on, when ſhe was brought vnto her husband, as is noted in the 
                     Gen. 24. 65. example of Rebekah: whereunto the Apoſtle alludeth in theſe words, 1 Cor. 11. 10. 
                  the woman ought to haue power on her head. That couer on the womans head, as in generall it implied ſubiection, ſo in particular this kinde of ſubiection, viz. a reuerend carriage and geſture. But moſt expreſly is this dutie ſet downe by 1 Pet. 3. 1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Saint Peter who exhorteth wiues to order their conuerſation before their husbands, ſo as it be pure, with reuerence.
               
               This reuerend conuerſation conſiſteth in a wiue-like ſobrietie, mildneſſe, courteſie, and modeſtie.
               
               By ſobriety I meane ſuch a comely, graue, and gratious carriage, as giueth euidence to the husband that his wife reſpecteth his place & the authority which God hath giuen him. Sobriety in generall is required of all women by reaſon of their ſexe; and ſurely it doth well become them all: but much more doth it become wiues: moſt of all, in their husbands preſence. 1 Tim. 3. 11. The Apoſtle in particular enioyneth it to Deacons wiues, yet not ſo as proper vnto them, but in a further reſpect appertaining to them not only as wiues, but as the wiues of Deacons.
               Contrary to this ſobriety is lightneſſe and wantonneſſe:

which vices in a wife, eſpecially before her husband, argueth little reſpect, if not a plaine contempt of him.
               
                  Obiect. Thus ſhall all delightfull familiarity betwixt huſband and wife be taken away.

Though the forenamed ſobriety be oppoſed to lightneſſe Difference betwixt wantonneſſe and familiarity. and wantonneſſe, yet not to matrimoniall familiarity: which is ſo farre permitted to man and wife, as if any other man and woman ſhould ſo behaue themſelues one towards another as an husband and wife lawfully may, it might iuſtly be counted lightneſſe and ſinne: inſtance the example of Iſaak and Rebekah, who ſo ſported together, as Abimelech, 
                  
                     Gen. 26. 8, 9. knowing them to be ſuch as feared God, gathered by that ſporting that they were man and wife: for he thought that otherwiſe they would not haue beene ſo familiar together.
               
                  See Treat. 4. §. 42. This familiarity argueth both liking and loue: and ſheweth that the man and wife delight in one anothers perſon. But the lightneſſe here condemned in a wife, is not ſo much a mutuall familiarity with her husband by his good liking, as a wanton dallying with others to his griefe and diſgrace.

                  wiue-like mildneſſe.
               
               Mildneſſe in a wife hath reſpect alſo to the ordering of her countenance, geſture, and whole cariage before her husband, whereby ſhe manifeſteth a pleaſingneſſe to him, and a contentedneſſe and willingneſſe to be vnder him and ruled by him. Excellently is this ſet forth in the ſpouſe of Chriſt whoſe eies are ſaid to be as doues eies, her lips to drop as honie combs, and 
                     Cant. 4. & 6. & 7. ſhe her ſelfe euery way pleaſant: whereupon it is noted that ſhe appeared to her husband as the bright morning, and that his heart was wounded with her. Aſſuredly the cleere skie is not more pleaſant in time of harueſt, then a milde and amiable countenance and carriage of a wife in her husbands preſence. Is cui leonum cura commiſſa eſt, blanda manu, mollique verborum ſono permulſos domat. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp. And though her husband ſhould be of an harſh and cruell diſpoſition, yet by this means might he be made meeke and gentle. For the keepers of Lions are ſaid to bring them to ſome tameneſſe by handling them gently and ſpeaking to them fairely.
               Contrary to this mildneſſe is a frowning brow, a lowring eie, a ſullen looke, a powting lip, a ſwelling face, a deriding

mouth, a ſcornefull caſt of the armes and hands, a diſdainfull turning of this ſide and that ſide of the body, and a fretfull flinging out of her husbands preſence: all which and other like contemptuous geſtures are as thicke clouds ouerſpreading the heauens in a Summers day, which make it very vncomfortable. They oft ſtirre vp much paſſion in the man, and bring much miſchiefe vpon the wife her ſelfe.

                  wiue-like courteſie and obeyſance.
               
               Courteſie is that vertue whereby a wife taketh occaſion to teſtifie her acknowledgement of her husbands ſuperiority by ſome outward obeyſance to him. Rebekah, ſo ſoone as ſhe ſaw Iſaak, whom ſhe had taken for her husband, lighted from her Camell and came to him on foot, which was a kinde of obeyſance. This is not ſo to be taken as if no difference were to be made betwixt the carriage of a ſeruant, or childe, and a wife: or as if a wife ſhould bow at euery word that ſhe ſpeaketh to her husband. Though in the kinde and extent of many duties the ſame things are required of wiues which are required of children and ſeruants, becauſe God hath made them all inferiours, and exacted ſubiection of all: yet in the manner and meaſure of many duties there is great difference: as in this, the obeyſance of children and ſeruants ought to be more ſubmiſſiue, and more frequent. Yet becauſe God hath placed authority in the husband ouer his wife, ſhe is euery way to teſtifie her reuerend reſpect of her husband, and therefore at ſome times, on ſome occaſions (as when he is going on a iourney for a time from her, or when he returneth home againe, or when ſhe hath a ſolemne and great ſute to make vnto him, or when he offereth an eſpeciall and extraordinary fauour vnto her, or (as I haue obſerued ſuch wiues as know what beſeemeth their place, and are not aſhamed to manifeſt as much) when ſhe ſitteth 1. A wiuelike courteſie worketh a good reſpect in her huſband to her. downe or riſeth vp from table) to declare her reuerence by ſome obeyſance. This cannot but much worke on the heart of a good and kinde husband, and make him the more to reſpect his wife, when he beholdeth this euidence of her reſpect to him. Yea it cannot but be a good patterne to children 2. It maketh her husband be honoured of others. and ſeruants, and a motiue to ſtirre them vp to yeeld all ſubmiſſiue obeyſance both to her husband and to her ſelfe.

For it may make them thus to reaſon with themſelues, ſhall 3. It bringeth honour to her ſelfe. we ſcorne or thinke much to yeeld that to our father or maſter which our mother or miſtreſſe thinketh not much to yeeld to her husband? ſhall-ſhe bow to him, and ſhall not we much more bow to her? Thus a wiues honouring of her husband by yeelding obeyſance to him, maketh both him and her ſelfe to be more honoured of others.
               Contrarily minded are they, who not only altogether omit Contrary ſcorne in wiues. this dutie, but alſo gibe and ſcoffe at the very hearing thereof, ſaying, thus wiues ſhall be made no better then children or ſeruants. But though ſcornefull dames deride theſe outward euidences of their ſubiection, yet ſuch wiues as feare the Lord ought not to be hindered thereby from doing their dutie: for by ſuch euill examples they might be diſcouraged from euery good dutie. It is ſufficient that ſuch holy women as truſted in God ſo behaued themſelues. But for this particular, we know that equals ſcorne not vpon occaſions to performe this kinde of courteſie in making obeyſance one to another: how much leſſe ought wiues, who are their husbands inferiours?

               Modeſtie appertaining to a wife is much manifeſted in her apparell. S. Paul requireth this modeſtie in generall of all ſorts of women: but S. Peter preſſeth it in particular vpon wiues. For as it well beſeemeth all women, ſo wiues after a peculiar manner, namely, in attiring themſelues, to reſpect rather their husbands place and ſtate, then their owne birth and parentage, but much rather then their owne minde and humour. A wiues modeſtie therefore requireth that her apparell be neither for coſtlineſſe aboue her husbands abilitie, nor for curiouſneſſe vn beſeeming his calling. As a poore mans wife muſt not affect coſtly apparell, ſo neither Miniſters, graue Counſellours, ſage Magiſtrates, no nor conſcionable Profeſſours wiues, hunt after new faſhions, or in light and gariſh apparell attire themſelues. It is a token of great reuerence in a wife towards her husband, to haue an eye to his place and ſtate in her apparell.

Such are they, who are no whit moued with their husbands example: but though the mans apparell be plaine and graue, yet the wiues ſhall be coſtly and gariſh. Yea many there be that ſtand in ſome more awe of their husbands ſight, but ſhew little more reſpect vnto him, who haue their ſilken gownes, Beauer hats, and other like attire not agreeable to their place and ſtate, lie in the countrey, if they be of the citie; or in the citie, if they be of the countrey, in a friends houſe where their husbands ſhall Quae ſe pingit comitque ſecus quàm viro gratum eſſe nouit, ſatis declarat ſeſe pluribus velle placcre quàm oportet mulierem pudicam, cuius praecipua laus eſt vni placuiſſe cui deſponſata eſt.

If the care of a wife were to giue euidence of the reuerence which ſhe beareth to her husband, his deſire and example would in this reſpect more preuaile with her, then the humour of her owne heart.

                  Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh. A wiues reuerence is manifeſted by her ſpeech, both in her husbands preſence, and alſo in his abſence.

Otherwiſe ſilence, as it is oppoſed to ſpeech, would imply ſtoutneſſe of ſtomacke, and ſtubbornneſſe of heart, which is an extreme contrarie to loquacitie. But the meane betwixt both, is for a wife to be ſparing in ſpeech, to expect a fit time and iuſt occaſion of ſpeech, to be willing to hearken to the word of knowledge comming out of her husbands mouth. This argueth reuerence.

Among all other titles the name husband, as it is the moſt vſuall, ſo it is the fitteſt and meeteſt title. It intimateth reuerence, and ſauoureth not of niceneſſe & ſingularitie, as theſe titles, Head, Guide, Maſter, Man, and the like doe: which though they be lawfull titles, becauſe the Scripture attributeth them to husbands, and they ſignifie ſuperioritie, yet becauſe they are vnuſuall and ſauour of ſingularitie, they are not ſo meet. Common vſe and practiſe hath made the addition of the husbands ſurname to this title Maſter, more meet.
               
                  1 Pet. 3. 6. Saint Peter by this argument proueth that Sarah obeyed Abraham, becauſe ſhe called him Lord.
               
               Contrarie are thoſe compellations which argue equalitie or inferioritie rather then ſuperioritie, as Brother, Coſen, Friend, Man, &c. if a ſtranger be in preſence, how can he tell by this manner of compellation, that he whom thou ſpeakeſt vnto is thy husband? If he eſpie any matrimoniall familiaritie betwixt you, what can he iudge of it otherwiſe to be, lightneſſe and wantonneſſe? Remember the fearefull iſſue that had like to haue fallen out by reaſon of ſuch compellations giuen by 
                     Gen. 12. 19. & 20. 2. 
                  Sarah and 
                     & 26. 9. 
                  Rebekah to their husbands. Not vnlike to thoſe are ſuch as theſe, Sweet, Sweeting, Heart, Sweet-heart, Loue, Ioy, Deare, &c. and ſuch as theſe, Ducke, Chicke, Pigſnie, &c. and husbands Chriſtian names, as Iohn, Thomas, William, Henry, &c. which if they be contracted (as many vſe to contract them thus, Iack
                        •
                     , Tom, Will, Hall) they are much more vnſeemly: ſeruants are vſually ſo called.
               But what may we ſay of thoſe titles giuen to an husband by

his wife, not ſeldome in paſſion, but vſually in ordinarie ſpeech, which are not fit to be giuen to the baſeſt men that be, as Grub, Rogue, and the like, which I am euen aſhamed to name, but that the ſins of women are to be caſt as dirt on their faces, that they may be the more aſhamed?
               
                  
                     Obiect. Many of the forenamed titles are titles of amitie and familiaritie.
                  
                     Anſw. Subiection is that marke which wiues are directed to aime at in their thoughts, words, deeds, and whole conuerſation towards their husband. Such tokens of familiaritie as are not withall tokens of ſubiection and reuerence, are vnbeſeeming a wife, becauſe they ſwerue from that marke.

                  meekneſſe in their ſpeeches.
               
               
                  Meekneſſe in a wiues manner of framing her ſpeech to her husband, doth alſo commend her reuerend reſpect of him. This is an eſpeciall effect of that meeke and quiet ſpirit which S. Peter requireth of wiues; which dutie he doth ſtrongly inforce by this weighty argument, 1 Pet. 3. 4. 
                  which is before God a thing much ſet by. Is a wiues meekneſſe much ſet by before God, and ſhall not wiues hold it both a bounden dutie, and comely ornament, and grace vnto them? As the forme of words which a wife vſeth in asking or anſwering queſtions, or any other kinde of diſcourſe which ſhee holdeth with her husband, ſo her moderation in perſiſting, arguing and preſſing matters, yea and the milde compoſition of her countenance in ſpeaking, declare her meekneſſe. If ſhe be deſirous to obtaine any thing of him, fairely ſhe muſt intreat it, as the 2 King. 4. 10. 22. 
                  Shunemite: If ſhe would moue him to performe a bounden dutie, mildly ſhe muſt perſwade him. If ſhe would reſtraine and keepe him from doing that which is euill, euen that alſo ſhe muſt doe with ſome meekneſſe, as 
                     Matt. 27. 19. 
                  Pilats wife: If ſhe haue occaſion to tell him of a fault, therein ſhe ought to manifeſt humilitie and reuerence, by obſeruing a fit ſeaſon, and doing it after a gentle manner as 2 Sam. 25. 31, 37. 
                  Abigail: who as ſhe wiſely behaued her ſelfe in this reſpect with her husband in obſeruing a fit ſeaſon, ſo alſo with Dauid by intimating his fault vnto him, rather then plainly reprouing him, when ſhe ſaid, It ſhall be no griefe nor offence vnto my Lord, that he hath not ſhed bloud cauſeleſſe. This

meekneſſe requireth alſo ſilence and patience, euen when ſhe is reproued.
               Contrary is the waſpiſh and ſhrewiſh diſpoſition of many Contrary wiues ſhrewiſh ſpeeches to their huſbands. wiues to their husbands, who care not how haſtily and vnaduiſedly they ſpeake to them, like 
                     Gen. 30. 1. 
                  Rahel; nor how angerly and chidingly, like 1 King. 21. 7. 
                  Iezabel; nor how diſdainfully, and ſpightfully, like 
                     Exo. 4. 25, 26. 
                  Zipporah; nor how ſcoffingly, and frumpingly, like 2 Sam. 6. 20. 
                  Michal; nor how reproachfully and diſgracefully, like 
                     Iob 2. 9. 
                  Iobs wife. If they be reproued by their husbands, their husbands ſhall be reproached by them: & they are ready to anſwer again, not only word for word, but ten for one. Many wiues by their ſhrewiſh ſpeeches, ſhew no more reſpect to their husbands, then to their ſeruants, if ſo much. The leaſt occaſion moueth them not only inwardly to be angry and fret againſt them, but alſo outwardly to manifeſt the ſame by chiding and brawling. The very obiect whereupon many wiues vſually ſpit out their venomous words, is their husband; when their ſtomacks are full, they muſt needs eaſe them on their husbands: wherein their fault is doubled.
               Let wiues therefore learne firſt to moderate their paſſion, and then to keepe in their tongues with bit and bridle, but moſt of all to take heed that their husbands taſte not of the bitterneſſe thereof, no not though they ſhould by ſome ouerſight of their husbands be prouoked. It is to be noted how Salomon calleth the iarres which are betweene man and wife, the contentions of a wife, whereby he intimateth that ſhe commonly 
                     Prou. 19. 13. is the cauſe thereof, either by prouoking her husband, or not bearing with him.

                  in his abſence.
               
               The reuerence which a wife beareth to her husband, muſt further be manifeſted by her ſpeeches of him in his abſence. So did Sarah manifeſt her reuerence, and ſo muſt all ſuch as deſire 
                     Gen. 18. 12. to be accounted the daughters of Sarah. The Church ſpeaking of her Spouſe, doth it with as great reuerence, as if ſhe 
                     Cant 5. 10. &c.
                   had ſpoken to him. It was for honour and reuerence ſake, that the Virgin Mary called Ioſeph the Father of Ieſus, when ſhe 
                     Luke 2. 48. ſpake of him.
               This ſheweth that a wiues reuerend ſpeeches in preſence of

her husband and to his face, are not in flatterie to pleaſe him and fawne vpon him, but in ſinceritie to pleaſe God and performe her dutie.
               Contrary therefore to their dutie deale they, who in preſence Contrary wiues bitter ſpeeches behind their huſbands backs. can afford the faireſt and meek eſt ſpeeches that may be to their husbands face, but See more hereof Treat 2. part 2. §. 36. behinde their backs ſpeake moſt reproachfully of them.
            
            
               §. 17. Of a wiues obedience in generall.
               
               Hitherto of a wiues reuerence, it followeth to ſpeake of her obedience: The firſt law that euer was giuen to woman ſince her fall, laid vpon her this dutie of Obedience to her husband, in theſe words, 
                     Gen. 3. 16. 
                  Thy deſire ſhall be to thine husband, and he ſhall rule ouer thee. How can an husband rule ouer a wife, if ſhe obey not him? The principall part of that ſubmiſſion which in this 
                     Epheſ. 5. 22. text, and in many other places is required of a wife, conſiſteth in obedience: and therefore it is expreſly commended vnto wiues in the example of Sarah who 1 Pet. 3. 6. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  obeyed Abraham. Thus by Obedience doth the Church manifeſt her ſubiection to Chriſt.
               The place wherein God hath ſet an husband; namely, to be an 
                     Epheſ. 5. 23. 
                  head; the authoritie which he hath giuen vnto him, to be a 1 Pet. 3. 6. 
                  Lord and 
                     Eſter 1. 17. 
                  Maſter; the duty which he requireth of him 
                     Gen. 3. 16. to rule, doe all require obedience of a wife. Is not obedience to be yeelded to an Head, Lord, and Maſter? Take away all authoritie from an husband, if ye exempt a wife from obedience.
               Contrary is the ſtoutneſſe of ſuch wiues as muſt haue their Contrary to obedience, ſtoutneſſe. own will, and doe what they liſt, or elſe all ſhall be out of quiet. Their will muſt be done, they muſt rule and ouer-rule all, they muſt command not only children and ſeruants, but husbands alſo, if at leaſt the husband will be at peace. Looke into families, obſerue the eſtate and condition of many of them, and then tell me if theſe things be not ſo. If an husband be a man of courage, and ſeeke to ſtand vpon his right, and maintaine his authoritie by requiring obedience of his wife, ſtrange it is to behold what an hurly burly ſhe will make in the houſe: but if he be a milke-ſop, and baſely yeeld vnto his wife, and ſuffer her to rule, then, it may be, there ſhall be ſome outward quiet. The ground hereof is an ambitious and proud humour in

women, who muſt needs rule, or elſe they thinke themſelues ſlaues. But let them thinke as they liſt: aſſuredly herein they thwart Gods ordinance, peruert the order of nature, deface the image of Chriſt, ouerthrow the ground of all dutie, hinder the good of the family, become an ill patterne to children and ſeruants, lay themſelues open to Satan, and incurre many other miſchiefes which cannot but follow vpon the violating of this maine duty of Obedience, which if it be not performed, how can other duties be expected?

                  Submiſſion in yeelding to her husbands minde and will.
               
                  See §. 49. 
                  Contentment in reſting ſatisfied and content with his eſtate and abilitie.
               That Submiſſion conſiſteth in two things.
               Firſt, in abſtaining from doing things againſt her husbands minde.
               Secondly, in doing what her husband requireth. The former of theſe requireth that a wife haue her husbands conſent for the things which ſhe doth. For the better cleering whereof we are to conſider,
               1. What kinde of husbands they muſt be whoſe conſent is required.
               2. How many waies his conſent may be giuen.
               3. What are the things whereabout his conſent is to be expected.
               For the firſt, as on the one ſide it oft falleth out that a wife, In two caſes a wife hath power to order things of her ſelfe, without her husbands conſent. prouident, and religious man is maried to a fooliſh woman, a very ideot, that hath no vnderſtanding, of whom there can be no queſtion, but that ſuch a wife is to doe nothing of her ſelfe, and of her owne head, but altogether to be ordered by her husband: So on the other ſide, it oft falleth out that a wiſe, vertuous, and gratious woman, is maried to an husband deſtitute 1 In caſe of her husbands impotency. of vnderſtanding, to a very naturall (as we ſay) or a 
                     •
                  renzy man, or to one made very blockiſh, and ſtupid, vnfit to manage his affaires through ſome diſtemper, wound, or ſickneſle.

In ſuch a caſe the whole gouernment lieth vpon the wife, ſo as her husbands conſent is not to be expected.
               
                  
                     Queſt. What if the husband be a wicked and prophane man, and ſo blinded and ſtupified in his ſoule, doth not this ſpirituall blindneſſe and blockiſhneſe giue a religious wife as great libertie as naturall ſtupiditie?
                  
                     Anſw. No verily: For S. Peter exhorteth faithfull wiues 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2. that were maried to Infidell husbands to be ſubiect to them, and that in feare.
                  
                  The reaſon is cleare: For ſpirituall blindneſſe diſableth not from ciuill gouernment: indeed nothing that ſuch a man doth is acceptable to God, or auailable to his owne ſaluation; but yet it may be profitable to man: a wicked man may be prouident enough for wife, children, and whole family in outward temporall things.
                  Againe, it oft falleth out, that an husband is a long time In caſe of impoſſibilitie for her huſband to doe it. farre off abſent from the houſe: ſometimes by reaſon of his calling, as an Ambaſſadour, Souldier, or Mariner; ſometimes alſo careleſly or wilfully neglecting houſe, goods, wife, children and all: and in his abſence hath left no order for the ordering of things at home: in this caſe alſo there is no queſtion, but that the wife hath power to diſpoſe matters without her husbands conſent: prouided that ſhe obſerue thoſe rules of Gods word concerning iuſtice, equitie, truth and mercie, which an husband in his diſpoſing of them ought to obſerue.
                  The firſt of theſe caſes declareth an impotencie in the huſband: the other an impoſſibilitie for him to order matters: wherefore the wife being next to the husband, the power of ordering things is diuolued on her: ſhe is not bound to haue his conſent.
               
            
            
               §. 19. Of diuers kindes of conſent.
               
               II. A conſent may be generall or particular. A generall 1. A generall conſent. conſent is giuen, when without diſtinct reſpect to this or that particular, libertie is granted to a wife by her husband to doe all things as ſeemeth good in her owne eyes. 
                     Prou. 31. 10, &c.
                   That excellent good wife, and notable good houſe-wife that is ſet forth by the Wiſe-man, had ſuch a conſent. For firſt, it is ſaid, 
                     Verſ. 11. 
                  The heart of her husband truſteth in her; and then it is inferred, that

ſhe ordereth all the things of the houſe, whereof many particulars are there ſpecified. Whence I gather, that her husband obſeruing her to be a godly, wiſe, faithfull, and induſtrious woman, gaue her power and liberty to doe in the houſe-hold affaires, what ſhe thought good, (he being a publike magiſtrate, for 
                     Verſ. 23. 
                  he was knowne in the gates, ſitting among the Elders of the land) and accordingly ſhe vſed her liberty.
               A particular conſent is that which is giuen to one or more particular 2. A particular conſent. things, as that conſent 
                     Gen. 16. 6. which Abraham gaue to Sarah about Hagar; and 1 Sam 1. 23. that which Elkanah gaue to Hanna about tarrying at home till her childe was weined.
               This particular conſent may be expreſſed or implied. An expreſſed conſent is when the husband manifeſteth his good liking by word, writing, meſſage, or ſigne, and that whether his conſent be asked (as was noted in the example of Elkanah) or freely offered.
               An implicit conſent, when by any probable coniecture it may be gathered that the husbands will is not againſt ſuch a thing, 4. An implicit conſent, though he haue not manifeſted his minde concerning that very particular. This implicit conſent may be gathered either by his ſilence when he is preſent to ſee a thing done, or otherwiſe hath knowledge thereof: or elſe when he is abſent, by his former cariage or diſpoſition in other like caſes. The Scripture accounteth an husbands ſilence, when he knoweth a thing and may, but doth not forbid it, to be a conſent: as 
                     Num 30. 8. in the caſe of a wiues vow. For any thing we read to the contrary 2 King. 4. 10, 23. the Shunemite had no other conſent to prepare a chamber for the Prophet, and to goe vnto him, then her husbands ſilence, and not forbidding it when he knew it.
               As for the other kinde of implicit conſent, it may be ſet forth in this following inſtance: ſuppoſe a good wife hath an husband whom ſhe knoweth by his former cariage and diſpoſition to be a pittifull and charitable man, taking all occaſions to ſhew mercy, and in his abſence there falleth out a fit and needfull occaſion of ſhewing mercy; if ſhe take that occaſion to ſhew mercy, ſhe hath an implicit conſent, for ſhe may well thinke that if her husband knew it he would approue what ſhe doth. It is to be ſuppoſed that 1 Sam. 1. 11. 
                  Annah vpon ſome ſuch ground vowed her childe to God.

For it is not likely that ſhe who would not tarry at home to weine her childe without her husbands conſent, would much leſſe vow him to the Lord (which was a farre greater matter) without ſome perſwaſion of her husbands good liking thereof. Now that a wife may ſhew ſhe dealeth vprightly in this caſe vpon a true perſwaſion of her heart concerning her husbands minde, ſhe ought (when conueniently ſhe can) to make known to her husband what ſhe hath done: as without all queſtion Annah did; and ſo much may be gathered out of theſe words which Elkanah vttered to Annah, 
                  1 Sam. 1. 23. 
                  the Lord eſtabliſh his word.
               
            
            
               §. 20. Of the things whereabout a wife muſt haue her huſbands conſent.
               
               The things whereabout an husbands conſent is to be expected, are ſuch as he by vertue of his place and authoritie hath power to order: as for example, ordering and diſpoſing the goods, cattell, ſeruants, and children of the family, entertaining ſtrangers; yea, alſo ordering euen his wiues going abroad, and making of vowes, with the like: now then diſtinctly to lay downe a wiues dutie in this firſt branch of obedience, it is this:
               
                  A wife muſt doe nothing which appertaineth to her husband authoritie ſimply without, or directly againſt his conſent. Doe not theſe words of that old law (thy deſire ſhall be to thy husband) 
                  
                     Gen. 3. 16. imply as much? I deny not but that there may be ſundry things proper and peculiar to a wife, wherein I will not reſtraine her libertie: and therefore I vſe this phraſe (which appertaineth to her husbands authoritie.) And I grant the forenamed generall and implicit conſent, to be a true conſent, ſo as there needeth not an expreſſe particular conſent for euery thing, and therefore I haue added theſe clauſes (ſimply without, or directly againſt conſent.)
               
               That is done ſimply without conſent which is done without all warrant from the husband, and that ſo couertly as ſhe is afraid it ſhould come to his notice, imagining he would by no meanes like it: As Rahels taking her fathers idols without all 
                     Gen. 31. 32. conſent of Iaakob.
               
               That is done directly againſt conſent which is expreſly forbidden and diſclaimed by the husband.
               
                  
But to deſcend to the particulars before mentioned: Firſt concerning the goods of the family: It is a queſtion controuerted whether the wife haue power to diſpoſe them without or againſt the husbands conſent.
               Before I determine the queſtion, I thinke it needfull to declare, 1. What goods, 2. What occaſion of giuing the queſtion is about.
            
            
               §. 21. Of the things which a wife may diſpoſe without her husbands conſent.
               
               1. For the goods, ſome are proper and peculiar to the wife: 
                     Quaedam bona ſunt propria vxoris, vt ſunt bona paraphernalia. Greg. Sayr. Clau. reg. l. 9. c. 16. others are common. Goods proper to the wife are ſuch as before mariage ſhe her ſelfe, or her friends except from the huſband to her ſole and proper vſe and diſpoſing, whereunto he alſo yeeldeth: or ſuch as after mariage he giueth vnto her to diſpoſe as ſhe pleaſe: ſuppoſe it be ſome rent, annuity, fees,

                     . by vertue whereof, prouiding ſufficiently for the family, ſhe may, as ſhe ſeeth good occaſion, of ſuch goods as are ſet apart to be ſpent, diſtribute to poore, or otherwiſe.
               This I haue noted for ſuch tender conſciences as thinke they cannot giue a bit of bread, or ſcarp of meat to a poore body, or make a meſſe of broth or caudle for a ſicke body, except they firſt aske their husbands conſent.
               Prouided that if her husband expreſly forbid this liberty, ſhe take it not except neceſſity require it.
               But our queſtion is concerning ſuch goods as the husband hath not ſet apart, but reſerued to his owne diſpoſing.
            
            
               §. 22. Of a wiues liberty in extraordinary matters.
               
               II. For the occaſion of diſpoſing goods it may be ordinary or extraordinary. Extraordinary for the good of the husband himſelfe, and others in the family, or ſuch as are out of the family. If there fall out an extraordinary occaſion whereby the wife by diſpoſing the goods without or againſt the conſent of her husband may bring a great good to the family, or preuent and keepe a great miſchiefe from it, ſhe is not to ſtay for his conſent; inſtance the example of 1 Sam. 25. 18. &c.
                   
                  Abigail. Thus a faithfull prouident wife obſeruing her husband to riot, and to ſpend all he can get in carding, dicing, and drinking, may without his conſent lay vp what goods ſhe can for her husbands, her own, her childrens, and whole houſholds good. This is no part of diſobedience, but a point wherein ſhe may ſhew her ſelfe a great good helpe vnto her husband; 
                     Gen. 2. 18. for which end a wife was firſt made.
               Concerning ſuch as are out of the family, if they be in great need, and require preſent releefe, though the wife know her husband to be ſo hard-hearted, as he will not ſuffer her to releeue ſuch an one, yet without his conſent ſhe may releeue him. The ground of this and other like caſes is that rule laid downe by the Prophets, and by Chriſt himſelfe, viz. 
                     Oſe. 6. 6. Mat 9. 13. & 12. 7. 
                  I will haue mercie and not ſacrifice. If God in caſe of mercie diſpenſeth with a dutie due to himſelfe, will he not much more diſpenſe with a dutie due to an husband?

                  reſtraint in diſpoſing goods without conſent of her husband: and of the ground of that reſtraint.
               
               Out of all theſe things thus premiſed I gather the true ſtate Non poteſt vxor ex bonis communibus occulte accipere ad donandum vel ad erogandum in alios vſus ſine expreſſa, aut praeſumpta ſaltem viri licentia. Gre
                        •
                     . Sayr. loc. citat. of the queſtion in controuerſie concerning the power of wiues in diſpoſing the goods of the family to be this,
               
                  Whether a wife may priuily and ſimply without, or openly and directly againſt her husbands conſent diſtribute ſuch common goods of the family as her husband reſerueth to his owne diſpoſing, there being no extraordinary neceſſity?
               
               The moſt ancient and common anſwer vnto this queſtion hath beene negatiue, namely, that a wife hath not power ſo to doe: whereunto I for my part ſubſcribe.
               The ground of this anſwer is taken from that primary law of the wiues ſubiection, 
                     Gen. 3. 16. 
                  Thy deſire ſhall be vnto thine husband. How is her deſire ſubiect to her husband, if in the caſe propounded ſhe ſtand not vpon his conſent? It is further confirmed both by the §. 17. forenamed, and alſo by all other proofes that might be produced out of the Scripture concerning the ſubiection of wiues vnto their husbands. If in ordering the goods of the family ſhe yeeld not ſubiection, wherein ſhall ſhe yeeld it?
               Againſt this ground-worke ſome obiect that 
                     Gen. 4. 7. the ſame law of ſubiection is impoſed vpon a younger brother in the very ſame words, and yet a younger brother was not therby bound How the law of ſubiection is applied to younger brothers. to haue his elder brothers conſent in diſpoſing his goods.
               
                  Anſw. The law of the regality (as I may ſo ſpeake) and preheminency of the firſt borne was vnder thoſe words ordained: and therfore a younger brother was made a ſubiect to his elder, while he remained in the family, as a ſonne to the father. The elder brother was as a lord ouer his other brothers: whereupon when Iſaak conferred the right of the firſt borne vpon Iaakob (thinking he had beene his eldeſt ſonne Eſau) he vſed theſe words, Be lord ouer thy brethren, and let thy 
                  
                     Gen. 27. 29. 
                  mothers ſonnes bow downe to thee. Which being ſo, queſtionleſſe the younger brother might not ſimply without or directly againſt the elder brothers conſent diſpoſe the goods of the family: ſo as this obiection more ſtrongly eſtabliſheth the forenamed argument.
               
                  
Againe it is obiected that that old law is to be expounded of weighty matters.
               
                  Anſw. The Apoſtle who was guided by the ſpirit of the 
                     Eph. 5. 24. law-maker, extendeth that law to euery thing: But is not this matter of diſpoſing goods a weighty matter? The conſequences which I ſhall by and by note to follow hereupon will ſhew it to be a matter of moment.
            
            
               §. 24. Of the example of the Shunemite in asking her huſbands conſent. 
                  2 King. 4. 9, 22.
               
               As another reaſon may be alleged the Shunemites patterne who asked her husbands conſent before ſhe prepared the things that were thought meet for the Prophets entertainment: and before ſhe vſed the things which were meet for her iourney.
               
                  
                     Obiect. It is indeed commendable for wiues to ſeeke their husbands conſent as ſhe did, but where ſuch conſent cannot be had, it is not neceſſary.
                  
                     Anſw. This example being grounded vpon a law (as we ſhewed §. 23. before) it doth not only declare what may be done, but alſo what ought to be done. And if a wife be bound to haue her husbands conſent for doing of a thing, by conſequence it followeth that ſhe is bound from doing it, without her huſbands conſent.
                  2. Anſw. They that except againſt this reaſon taken from example, vſe themſelues the like reaſon in other points, as the examples of Abigail, Ioanna, and Suſanna for the contrarie.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. In the Shunemites example there was more then a mercifull releefe of the Prophet, namely bringing him into the houſe to diet and to lodge, wherein the husband muſt haue a chiefe ſtroake.
                  
                     Anſw. The word of God maketh not that difference betwixt releeuing and entertaining: it extendeth a wiues ſubiection to euery thing: wherefore the husband hath a chiefe ſtroake as well in the one, as in the other.
               
            
            
               §. 25. Of the law of a wiues vow.
               
               A third reaſon is taken from the law of a wiues vow: whereby 
                     Num. 30. 7. &c.
                   in generall is implied, that a wife might not make a vow

without her husbands conſent: whence it followeth as an argument taken from the greater to the leſſe, that ſhe may not diſpoſe the goods without his conſent. Yea, 
                     Verſ. 13. the Law further expreſly ſaith, that though ſhe hath vowed, yet her husband hath power to diſanull her vow. Note here, how the Lord will rather depart from his owne right (as I may ſo ſpeake) then haue that order which he hath appointed betwixt man and woman broken. The Lords right, was to haue what was vowed to him performed: the order which he appointed, was to haue the wife ſubiect to her husband: rather then the wife ſhould doe that which the husband would not haue done, the Lord remitted a wiues vow in caſe her husband would not conſent to haue it performed. Now then I demand, is the diſpoſing of goods a greater matter then the performing of a vow? or hath a wife in theſe dayes more libertie then in former? if ſhe haue, by what law? was there euer vnder the Law a ſtraiter charge laid vpon wiues then this, Let wiues be ſubiect to their husbands in euerie thing.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. That point of a womans ſubiection in performing her vow, is a particular ruled caſe: but not this of diſpoſing goods.
                  
                     Anſw. The Scripture by particular Lawes and examples teacheth directions for other caſes like to them: and arguments drawne by iuſt and neceſſarie conſequence, are counted as ſound as expreſſe teſtimonies. Whereas it is ſaid, that this particular in queſtion is not expreſly decided, I take the reaſon thereof to be this, that in former times they ſo well marked the extent of the generall law of a wiues ſubiection, as they made no queſtion of doing this or other like things without their husbands conſent. Neither did good wiues take that libertie, neither had they any patrons of ſuch libertie.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. The caſe of a wiues diſpoſing goods is vnlike to that of vowes, becauſe vowes are voluntarie, but diſpoſing goods, as a worke of mercie, is neceſſarie.
                  
                     Anſw. Though it were a voluntarie thing to make, or not to make a vow: yet a vow being made, it was not in the power of the partie that made it, not to performe it: it was a 
                        Num. 30. 3. Deut. 23. 21. Eccleſ. 5. 4. neceſſarie dutie to performe a vow, euen expreſly commanded. As

for the pretended worke of mercie, I will §. 34. hereafter ſhew, that a wife is not neceſſarily tied thereunto.
               
            
            
               §. 26. Of humane lawes which reſtraine wiues from diſpoſing goods, without or againſt their husbands conſent.
               
               A fourth is taken from the lawes of men whereunto we are ſubiect, and which we muſt obey euen for conſcience ſake, ſo farre as they thwart not Gods Law, which in this caſe they doe not, as the reaſons before gathered out of Gods word doe ſhew.
               Now our Law ſaith, that 45. E. 3. Fitz. Couen. 18. euerie gift, grant, or diſpoſition of goods, lands, or other thing whatſoeuer made by a woman 1. H. 5. 12. b. Perk. cap. de Grant. Nat. Breu. fol. 120. G.
                   couert, and all and euerie obligation and feoffment made by her, and recouerie ſuffered, if they be done without her huſbands conſent, are void. Yea, 
                     Nat. Breu. fol. 188. H.
                   if ſhe doe wrong to another, ſhe hath not any thing to make ſatisfaction during couerture: either her husband muſt doe it, or by impriſonment of her perſon muſt it be done. And 
                     Perk. fol. 2. a.
                   though ſhe haue inheritance of her owne, yet can ſhe not grant any annuitie out of it during her couerture, without her husband: if any deed be made to that purpoſe without his conſent, or in her name alone, it is void in law. Yea, 
                     Perk. fol. 2. b.
                   if there be debate betweene the husband and his wife, whereby certaine lands of the husbands be aſſigned to the wife with his conſent, if out of ſuch lands ſhe grant an annuitie to a ſtranger, the grant is void. And 27. H. 8. 27. p. 12. if he couenant to giue her yeerely ſuch and ſuch apparell, ſhe cannot diſpoſe it as ſhe liſt without his conſent, but only vſe and weare it her ſelfe. 
                     Perk. fol. 3. a.
                   Neither can ſhe leaſe her owne land for yeeres, for life, &c. if ſhe doe, it is void, and the Leſſee entring by force thereof, is a Diſſeiſor to the husband, and Treſpaſſor. And 21. H. 7. 18. p. 29. Nat. Breu. fol. 120 G.
                   if ſhe ſell any thing, the ſale is void, except ſhe be a merchant, where by the cuſtome ſhe is enabled to merchandize. Finally,

If ſhe make a will, and thereby deuiſe her owne inheritance, and her husband die, and ſhe after die without any new publication of it, it is of no force, becauſe it was void at firſt. Theſe and many other like caſes which might be alleaged euidently ſhew that by law a wife hath not

power of her ſelfe, without her husband, to diſpoſe the common goods of the familie.
            
            
               §. 27. Of the inconueniences which may follow vpon a wiues diſpoſing goods without or againſt her husbands conſent.
               
               A fit reaſon may be taken from the miſchiefes which would 1. A mans eſtate may be waſted before he can tell how to redreſſe it. fall out if this liberty were giuen vnto women: which are theſe that follow:
               1. The eſtate of the family might be waſted before any redreſſe could be thought of: for if the wife may diſpoſe the goods without her husbands conſent, it muſt alſo be granted without his knowledge: for it is to be ſuppoſed that if he knew of the diſpoſing of that which he liketh not, he would hinder it: if without his knowledge, then may that which he thinketh to be remaining as a ſtocke for the family, be laid out by the wife, and nothing left: whereas if he knew of the ſpending of that ſtocke, it might be he would be more thrifty and ſparing in other expences.
               
                  
                     Obiect. This liberty is not granted to wiues beyond their husbands ability.
                  
                     Anſw. Wiues cannot alwaies know their husbands ability: for their husbands may be much indebted, and yet to maintaine his credit, whereby he hopeth to raiſe his eſtate, may allow liberall maintenance for his houſe, if thereupon his wife ſhall gather that he is very rich, and accordingly be very bountifull in her gifts, ſhe may ſoone goe beyond his ability, and ſo increaſe his debt, as he ſhall neuer be able to recouer himſelfe.
                  2. Perſons of contrary religions and diſpoſitions being 2. Profeſſors of contrarie religions may be ſuſtained by the goods of the ſame family. out of the family, might be maintained by the goods of the ſame family: for if the husband were of one religion, and the wife of another, he without her knowledge might maintaine thoſe of his religion, and ſhe without his knowledge might maintaine them of her religion.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. This liberty of diſpoſing goods giuen to the wife is limited within the bounds of the houſhold of faith.
                  
                     Anſw. If Diuines grant them this liberty, they will themſelues iudge and determine who be of the houſhold of faith:

Popiſh wiues will ſay (ſay we what we can to the contrary) that Ieſuites, Prieſts, and Friers, are of the houſhold of faith, principall members thereof.
                  3. Many iarres and contentions would thence ariſe betwixt 3. Iars would ariſe betwixt man and wife. husband and wife: for if a wife ſhall perſiſt to doe that which her husband will not conſent vnto, aſſuredly one of a thouſand will not well brooke it, but will rather ſeeke all the wayes he can to croſſe her; thinking himſelfe deſpiſed, if ſhe, whether he will or no, haue her minde.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Wiues muſt vſe this libertie with all due reſpect vnto their husbands authoritie.
                  
                     Anſw. If the husband peremptorily ſtand vpon his authoritie, and by all the faire meanes that can be vſed, will not yeeld this libertie, I know not what better reſpect ſhe can ſhew to this authoritie, then to forbeare and abſtaine from doing that which otherwiſe ſhe would moſt gladly doe: But if when it commeth to the vttermoſt point, and ſhe ſhall ſay it is her right, and if ſhe cannot haue his conſent, ſhe will doe it without his conſent, ſhe therein ſheweth no great reſpect.
                  Many other inconueniences might be reckoned vp, but I will not longer inſiſt on them, only from theſe let it be well conſidered, whether it were not better for a familie, that the huſband ſhould be bard from diſpoſing the goods without conſent of his wife (ſo as there might be according to the prouerbe, but Though ſhe had a proprietie, yet hath ſhe not thereupon libertie to diſpoſe the goods. one hand in the purſe) then both husband and wife to haue libertie to diſpoſe them without each others conſent.
               
            
            
               §. 28. Of propertie in goods, whether it giue libertie to diſpoſe them as a wife will.
               
               To iuſtifie a wiues libertie in diſpoſing the common goods

               1. Anſw. Though it were granted that a wife hath a true property in the goods, yet this concluſion would not follow thereupon, that ſhe hath power of her ſelfe to diſpoſe the goods without her husbands conſent: for the authoritie which God hath giuen an husband, and ſubiection which he hath laid on a wife, reſtraine her power and libertie in that

which is her owne: as for example, ſuppoſe See Doctr. & ſtud. fol. 13. that a woman at the time of her mariage haue a leaſe for yeeres, or the wardſhip of the body and lands of an infant, or haue it by gift or

Or ſuppoſe that the only childe of her father be an inheretrix of land, and haue in her ſelfe (her father being dead) the full poſſeſſion thereof: or that a widow haue the right vnto, and poſſeſſion of her husbands eſtate, and thus poſſeſſed be maried to an husband, hath ſhe being a wife liberty to diſpoſe that eſtate which ſhe brought with her without or againſt her husbands conſent? I thinke none will ſay it. Sure I am that what ſhe giueth, lendeth, ſelleth, or otherwiſe diſpoſeth without his conſent, he if he will, may for his lifetime recouer againe: and yet no man will denie but that ſhe hath the trueſt intereſt and propertie in the forenamed lands and inheritance.
               
                  
                     Obiect. May ſhe not as well diſpoſe of her owne inheritance, as of thoſe goods, or reuenues which her husband giueth her?
                  
                     Anſw. No, for the gift of the husband is a generall conſent of his for her to diſpoſe that which is giuen her as ſhe ſeeth meet.
               
            
            
               §. 29. Of the reaſons againſt a wiues propertie in the common goods of the family.
               
               2. Anſw. It may ſafely be denied that a wife hath a propertie in the common goods of the family whereof ſhe is no heire, for property in goods is a ciuill matter, and to be limited according to the law of man vnder which we liue. Where the law, or cuſtome of the place, make all the children coheires, all haue an equall right to their ſeuerall parts: where the eldeſt only is made heire, he hath a right to all: where the youngeſt only is made heire, he hath a right to all: but neither the law of nations, nor of the land where we liue giue the wife a property. 12. H. 7. 22. Coke rep. 5. fo. 36. 28. H. 6. Dier fol. 6. plito. 5 Doct. & ſtud. fo. 13. Plowd. Comment. Bracebriges Caſe. By the common law mariage is a gift of all the goods and chattels perſonall of the wife to her husband, ſo that no kinde of propertie in the ſame remaineth in her. 4. H. 6. 31. And all

perſonall goods and chattels during mariage giuen to the wife are preſently ipſo facto transferred (as to the property of them) to the husband. So that by our law ſhe is ſo farre from gaining any property by her mariage in her husbands goods, as ſhe loſeth all the property ſhe formerly had in her owne goods. Yea 18. E. 4. 11. p. 4 her neceſſary apparell is not hers in property. While ſhe remaineth a wife ſhe is (to vſe the law-phraſe) vnder couert baron. 
                  See §. 26. She can neither let, ſell, alien, giue, nor otherwiſe of right make any thing away, no nor yet make a will ſo to diſpoſe any goods while her husband liueth without his conſent: which yet an husband may while his wife liueth, and that without or againſt her conſent.
               
                  
                     Obiect. The law ſtates a wife in a great part of the husbands goods, prouiding for her iointer or thirds which the husband cannot make away without her conſent.
                  
                     Anſw. This prouiſion is only for the time of her widowhood in caſe ſhe ouerliue him: but for the time that ſhe remaineth his wife he may make away all, and ſhe can recouer none, till he be dead.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. This reſtraint of wiues is only in the court of men.
                  
                     Anſw. Seeing it is not againſt the law of God, it muſt alſo hold good in the court of Conſcience. Nay it is agreeable to the law of God and grounded thereupon.
                  For (to omit the proofes before alleaged) what might be the reaſon that the daughters of Zelophehad, who were heires to their father, were forbidden to mary out of their fathers tribe, and that a law was made that no daughters that poſſeſſed any inheritance ſhould mary out of their fathers tribe, but becauſe all that a woman had before mariage, paſſed vpon the husband and became his by vertue of mariage? This alſo for that purpoſe is by ſome not vnfitly, nor without probabilitie noted, that it is the common phraſe of Scripture to terme huſbands 
                        Si quis abduxerit vxorem cum bonis familiae dicitur abducere vxorem cum bonis viri. Fitzherb. Nat. breutum fol. 89. (but not wiues) rich, implying thereby that riches by a property appertaine to husbands: yea vſually in Scripture goods and lands are ſaid to be the husbands.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. The wiues of Iaakob doe terme the goods which their husbands had theirs, ſaying, the riches which God hath taken from our Father is OVRS, Gen. 31. 16.
                  
                     
                     Anſw. They vſe the word Ours in oppoſition to their fathers houſe, and in relation not to their perſons, but to their Ut vinum temperatum licet maiori ex parte aquae conſtat, vinum appellamus: ſic cenſus quamuis plus contribuerit vxor, nuncupandus viri eſt. Plut. in praec. connub. husbands family, and therefore they adde and our childrens: So as by that place no greater right can be proued for wiues, then for children. When the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh of the ſame goods, he ſaith not in relation to husband and wiues both, their flockes, their ſubſtance, but only in relation to the huſband, his flockes, his ſubſtance. For as in mixture of wine and water, though the greater quantitie be water, yet we call the whole, wine: ſo in the common goods of the family, though the wife ſhould bring the greater part, we call all the husbands.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 30. Of anſwers to the reaſons for a wiues property.
               
               To proue a wiues property in the common goods of the family the reaſons following are alledged.
               
                  1. Obiect. Mariage giuing a wife right of her husbands body, 
                        Cor. 7. 4. doth much more of his goods.
                  
                     Anſw. I denie the conſequence. For the vſe of the body is a proper act of the matrimoniall bond, wherein the difference betwixt ſuperioritie and ſubiection appeareth not: the wife hath as great a power ouer the husbands body as the husband ouer the wiues: which is not ſo in the goods: no one thing can be named, wherein the power and authoritie of the husband more conſiſteth, then in the goods.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. In the forme of mariage the man ſaith to his wife, with all my worldly goods I thee indow.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. 1. Thoſe words are to be taken of the vſe of his goods, and not of a property in them.
                  2. If an husband ſhall intend a property by them, that property which ſhe hath thereby, ſhe hath not by vertue of the generall law of mariage, but of his particualar free donation.
                  3. In all countries thoſe words are not vſed in the forme of mariage. If thoſe words giue the wife her property, then ſuch wiues as are maried without thoſe words vſed, haue no property: ſo as this cannot be a generall ground of liberty for all wiues.
               
               
                  3. Obiect. A wife hath as good an eſtate in her husbands

goods as the Church in Chriſts bloud: but there the Church hath a property.
                  
                     Anſw. Neither of thoſe points can be proued. But if a wiues right in her husbands goods be as the Churches in Chriſts bloud, what is gotten thereby? The Church hath not power without or againſt Chriſts conſent to diſpoſe his bloud: The Church of Rome is counted a proud vſurping ſtrumpet for taking vpon her ſo to doe.
               
            
            
               §. 31. Of the priuiledges of wiues aboue Children and ſeruants in and about the goods of the familie.
               
               
                  Queſt. Where then is the preferment of the wife aboue ſeruants and children, if ſhe haue not a property?
                  
                  I anſwer, Much euery manner of way.
                  
                  1. Treat. 4. §. 52. 54. There is due to her a more free and plentifull vſe of all the goods, then vnto them.
                  2. By her place ſhe hath the ordering and diſpoſing of the goods allotted for the common vſe of the familie: as was §. 21. before granted.
                  3. Her husband ought to giue her a portion to diſpoſe as ſhe ſhall ſee good, Treat. 4. §. 54. as we ſhall after ſhew, when we come to the husbands duties.
                  4. She is a ioint gouernour with her husband ouer the children and ſeruants, as was ſhewed §. 4. before.
                  Againe I anſwer, that this argument might as well be alledged againſt that feare, ſubiection, and obedience which the Scripture expreſly requireth of wiues, and it might be demanded, if wiues muſt feare and obey their husbands and be ſubiect vnto them, where is their preferment aboue their children and ſeruants. But §. 11. it hath beene ſhewed that though the ſame things for matter be required of wiues which are required of children and ſeruants, yet there is a great difference in the manner of performing them.
               
            
            
               §. 32. Of examples and other reaſons alleadged for libertie of wiues to diſpoſe goods.
               
               
                  2. Abigails example is alleadged for a wiues libertie: and 2. Reaſon. Examples. 1 Sam. 25. 18. &c. Pro. 31. 11, &c.
                      the example of the good houſe wife deſcribed by Salomon.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. 1. Abigails example was extraordinary; beſides, who can tell whether the heart of her husband ſo truſted not in her

as he referred the whole gouernment of the houſe to her, and ſo ſhe had a generall conſent for what ſhe did.
                  2. It is cleere that the other good-wife had her husbands conſent for what ſhe did: for beſides that it is ſaid the heart of her husband truſted in her, it is alſo ſaid, that he praiſed her. Therefore he was neither ignorant of that which ſhee did, nor vnwilling ſhe ſhould doe it: it was neither without nor againſt his conſent.
               
               
                  3. It is alleadged that wiues haue as great a care in getting 3. Reaſon. Wiues haue a like care in getting goods. goods, or in preſeruing them for the good of the familie: therefore it is iuſt and equall, that they ſhould haue a like power in diſpoſing them.
                  
                     Anſw. Though queſtion may be made of the former part, at leaſt for the greater ſort and number of wiues, yet for anſwer to this reaſon I need not queſtion it; for the conſequence doth not follow, though that be granted. The right of diſpoſing goods doth not ſimply riſe from the care and paines of getting and preſeruing them: but from that order that the Lord hath beene pleaſed to ſet downe. A wiſe and induſtrious childe may be a meanes to raiſe and increaſe his fathers eſtate, when his father taketh little care and paines about it: yea a faithfull and wiſe ſteward or other ſeruant (as Iaakob and Ioſeph were) may doe much more by his paines and care in getting and preſeruing the goods of the familie, then his maſter: yet will it not thereupon follow, that ſuch a childe, or ſuch a ſeruant hath as great a right and power to diſpoſe ſuch goods as his father or his maſter.
               
               
                  4. The neere coniunction betwixt man and wife is alleaged: 4. Reaſon. Wiues are yoak-fellowes with their husbands. they are ſaid to be yoake-fellowes, and thence is inferred that they haue a like power in diſpoſing goods.
                  
                     Anſw. They are yoak-fellowes in mutuall familiaritie, not in equall authoritie; and in relation to others as children and ſeruants, not in oppoſition each to other. In this reſpect ſhe is ſubiect, not equall. If therefore he will one thing, and ſhe another, ſhe may not thinke to haue an equall right and power, ſhe muſt giue place and yeeld.
               
            
            
               
               §. 33. Of the 
                  Treat. 4. §. 54. 
                  ſubiection of wiues in diſtributing goods to charitable vſes.
               
               Some that grant that a wife is ſo ſubiected to her husband in a ciuill manner, as ſhe may not diſpoſe any part of his goods at her pleaſure to any ciuill vſe, denie this ſubiection to extend to giuing of almes, and ſuch like charitable vſes.
               Before I come to determine this queſtion, let it be remembred, that it was before granted, that § 22. ordinarie dutie muſt giue place to extraordinarie need, ſo that releefe in preſent neceſſitie is not controuerted. Let it be alſo remembred that §. 21. a wife may haue goods proper to her ſelfe, yea Treat. 4. §. 54. it ſhall be ſhewed that an husband ought according to his abilitie to commit ſomething to her diſcretion and diſpoſition: of theſe and ſuch like goods ſhe is as much bound as her husband to expend ſomething to charitable vſes: and (as God offereth occaſion) 
                     Pro. 31. 20. 
                  to reach forth her hand to the poore and needy.
               
               Yea further let this be premiſed, that in caſe a wife be forbidden or reſtrained by her husband, ſhe ought to vſe all the good meanes ſhe can by her ſelfe and her friends to moue her husband to grant her ſome libertie, that ſhe may haue ſome triall of her mercifull and charitable diſpoſition: if herein ſhe cannot preuaile, then ſhe ought to make knowne vnto her husband ſuch perſons caſes as ſhe thinkes meet to be releeued, and vſe all the motiues ſhe can to perſwade him to afford them ſome releefe.
               But put the caſe a wiſe, religious, mercifull wife, be maried State of queſtion. to a couetous worldling, who though he haue wit, and vnderſtanding enough to manage ciuill affaires, and to prouide for the outward temporall eſtate of the houſe, yet hath no heart to releeue the poore, and is not only vnwilling himſelfe to doe good in that kinde, but will not ſuffer his wife to doe it, whether may a wife priuilie take of ſuch goods as he hath reſerued to his owne diſpoſing, and ſimply without any kinde of conſent diſtribute them to charitable vſes, or though he expreſly forbid her, yet directly againſt his conſent diſpoſe them?
               
                  
With reuerend reſpect to better iudgements, I thinke ſhe may 
                     Non excuſ
                           •
                        bit bona intentio vxoris, etiamſi ea acciperet ad eleemoſynam faciendam. Greg. Sayr. clav. reg. lib. 9. cap. 16. not (except before excepted.) For it being before proued in generall, that ſhe had no ſuch liberty in diſpoſing goods, I cannot ſee how this particular end of giuing almes can diſpence with her generall ſubiection in euery thing, except there were ſome particular warrant for it in Gods word.
            
            
               §. 34. Of generall exhortations to works of mercy. How far they binde wiues.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. The many generall exhortations vnto workes of mercy, which without limitation to any particular perſons, are indefinitely directed to all, doe giue ſufficient warrant to wiues: ſuch as theſe, 
                        Luke 11. 41. 
                     Giue almes. 
                     
                        Gal. 6. 10. 
                     Let vs doe good. 
                     
                        Heb. 13. 16. 
                     To diſtribute forget not, &c.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. All theſe are ſtrong motiues to prouoke wiues to be mercifull and charitable in ſuch things as they may, by any means with their husbands conſent, or in ſuch things as by their huſbands are giuen to them. Yea alſo they are ſtrong motiues to prouoke husbands to allow them liberty to giue almes. But in the caſe propounded they giue no liberty to wiues: for it is a ruled caſe laid downe by Chriſt himſelfe, that workes of charity muſt be done, and almes muſt be giuen of ſuch things 
                        Luke 11. 41. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     as we haue, or which are in our power to giue. Now if the husband will not giue her that power, ſhe hath not power to giue, and ſo is excuſed. 
                        Date quae habetis eleemoſynam Tertul. contr. Marcion. l. 4. 2 Cor. 8. 12. In this caſe her true will, and her faithfull and earneſt deſire ſhall be accepted for the deed, according to that which the Apoſtle ſaith, if there be firſt a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. Many caſes may be giuen wherein inferiours are reſtrained from workes of mercy; as ſuppoſe a ſonne or ſeruant be deſirous to viſit one ſicke 
                        •
                     r in priſon, but his Parent or Maſter (though leaue be asked) will not ſuffer him, but charge him not to ſtirre out of doores, or 
                        •
                     o goe with him another way, ſhall this ſonne or ſeruant notwithſtanding that charge, doe that worke of mercy?
               
            
            
               §. 35. Of obedience to an husband in ſuch things as he ſinfully forbiddeth.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. 2. This reſtraint is not in the Lord, but rather againſt him and his word, therefore a wife is not bound thereunto.
                  
                     Anſw. Though the husband ſinne in reſtraining his wife, yet

ſhee in that reſtraint may obey, and that in the Lord: becauſe the Lord who hath commanded her to be ſubiect in euery thing, hath no where warranted her not to be ſubiect in this particular. It is expreſly ſaid in the law concerning a wiues vowes, that if her huſband breake them after he hath heard them, he ſhall beare her iniquity. 
                     
                        Numb. 30. 16. Did not he then ſinne in reſtraining her, and was not ſhe guiltleſſe though ſhe yeelded to his reſtraint? The condition betwixt husbands and wiues in this caſe, is not vnlike the caſe betwixt other ſuperiours in authority, and their inferiours in ſubiection. But other inferiours may lawfully abſtaine from ſuch things as their gouernours doe ſinfully charge them to abſtaine from. For ſuppoſe a ſonne growen to be a man, liue in his fathers houſe at his fathers finding, and haue no ſet portion of his owne, and his father will not giue him leaue to beſtow any thing on charitable vſes, is he now bound to giue almes? ſhall the curſe be executed on him if he giue not? A croſſe indeed I acknowledge it to be, both to ſuch a ſonne, and alſo to a wife to be ſo reſtrained: but not a curſe or ſinne; the ſinne and curſe lieth on their head, who reſtraine them by vertue of their authority, wherein they abuſe their authority: as other gouernours may do and oft do, and yet neither liberty granted thereby to ſubiects, nor authority taken from gouernours. In this reſemblance betwixt a ſonne and a wife I deſire not to be miſtaken; for I alleadge it not to make the ſtate of a wife and a ſonne all one: but to ſhew that thoſe generall precepts of giuing almes, may haue their exceptions, as they which in particular handle that point, giue other examples. There muſt therefore be a further ground then the generall commandement of almes-giuing to proue the forenamed liberty of wiues.
               
            
            
               §. 36. Of Zipporahs caſe in circumciſing her ſonne.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. 3. A wife was made to be an helpe to her husband: in thoſe things therefore wherein he faileth, ſhe muſt make ſupply, as Zipporah who performed a duty which belonged to her 
                        Exod. 4. 25. husband, and not vnto her.
                  
                     Anſw. She may be an helpe in many other things, though this be out of her power: yea and in this alſo by counſell, perſwaſion, and other like meanes ſhe may be a great helpe. The caſe of Zipporah was extraordinary, and of an vrgent preſent neceſſity, euen to ſaue the life of her husband. Beſides, Moſes was of himſelfe

vnable to doe it, but willing that ſhe ſhould doe it. Now what is this to ordinarie caſes, and ſuch caſes as husbands are able enough themſelues to doe, but altogether vnwilling that it ſhould be done by their wiues?

                  But what if Zipporahs example herein be not warrantable? for it doth not appeare that it was ſimply approued of God: God doth oft remoue temporary iudgements for the very workes ſake that is done, though in the manner it be ſinfully done.

               §. 37. Of the wife of Chuzas caſe in miniſtering to Chriſt.
               
               
                  4. Obiect. Ioanna the wife of Chuza, Herods ſteward, miniſtred vnto Chriſt of her ſubſtance without her husbands conſent.
                  
                     Anſw. If this could be proued it were ſomewhat to the purpoſe; but this clauſe without her husbands conſent (wherein the maine ſtate of the queſtion conſiſteth) is not in the text, nor by any good probabilitie can be gathered out of it. All the ſhew of probabilitie that can be ſhewed for it is, that Ioanna is there ſaid to be the wife of Chuza, Herods ſteward. But to ſhew that that is nothing, let it be noted,
                  1. That phraſe doth not imply that Chuza was then liuing. It is ſaid that Dauid begat Salomon of the wife of Vriah, but 
                        Matth. 1. 6. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     Vriah was not then liuing: therefore the tranſlators for perſpicuitie ſake doe inſert theſe words (her that had beene) the wife of Vriah. So likewiſe Onan is commanded to goe in to his 
                        Gen. 38. 8. 
                     brothers wife, yet doth not this imply that his brother was then liuing.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Why ſhould mention be made of Chuza, Herods ſteward, if he were not then liuing?
                  
                     Anſw. To ſhew that Ioanna was a woman of great place, whereby this fruit of her faith in following Chriſt was the more commended. Thus in another kinde Matthew is intitled 
                        Matth. 10. 3. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     the Publican, after he had cleane relinquiſht that office, the more to commend his faith.
                  I doe not here directly affirme that Chuza was then dead, but for ought that this phraſe doth imply, he might be dead.
                  2. Some gather that this ſteward was that Ruler whoſe 
                        Chemnit. Harm. Euang. cap. 33. Ioh. 4. 53. ſonne Chriſt healed, who thereupon beleeued with all his houſe.
                     
Which if he were, then it cannot be doubted, but that his wife followed Chriſt with his good liking and conſent.
                  3. Chuza being Herods ſteward, and ſo a man of great place, and publike imploiment, might, if he were then liuing, depute the managing of all affaires at home to his wife, as the 
                        Prou. 31. 11. husband of the good wife commended by Salomon, and ſo ſhe might haue at leaſt a generall conſent.
                  I doe not certainly determine any of theſe expreſly to be ſo, I doe but note them as probabilities, yet ſuch as doe ſufficiently ouerthrow the ſurmiſed libertie of a wife in giuing almes without any conſent of her husband: for this of all other probabilities ſeemeth to be moſt improbable. Into my heart it can neuer enter to imagine that Chriſt would giue ſuch an occaſion of ſlander vnto his enemies, as to ſay he caried about with him other mens wiues, without or againſt the conſent of their husbands, and ſuffered them to ſpend the goods of their huſbands vpon him. I had much rather thinke that either ſuch women as followed him had no husbands liuing, or if they had, that they did that which they did with the conſent of their husbands.
               
            
            
               §. 38. Of the 
                  Treat. 4. §. 18. 52. 
                  reſtraint of wiues about allowance for themſelues or families without their husbands conſent.
               
               That which hath hitherto beene deliuered concerning a wiues ſubiection in diſpoſing goods, may alſo be applied to other things concerning her ſelfe, children, ſeruants, &c. whereof I will giue ſome examples.
               A wife hath not power to appoint what ſhe liſt her ſelfe without or againſt her husbands conſent, either for her owne allowance, or for her family; ſhe muſt rather reſt ſatisfied with that which he appointeth: for he being the head, muſt haue the ouer-ruling ſtroake therein. Beſides he better knoweth what may be afforded.
               
                  
                     Queſt. What if an husband make himſelfe poorer then he is: and the allowance which he appointeth be meaner then his meanes, and vnbeſeeming his place and ſtate?
                  
                     Anſw. She ought, if poſſiby ſhe can by her owne inſtant perſwaſion, or any other faire meanes, moue him to that which tendeth to his honour and reputation: but if ſhe can

no way preuaile, her ſubiection requireth contentment and patience.
               
            
            
               §. 39. Of a wiues 
                  Treat 4. §. 18. 
                  ſubiection to her husband about children.
               
               A wife may not ſimply without, or directly againſt her huſbands conſent, order and diſpoſe of the children in giuing them names, apparelling their bodies, appointing their callings, places of bringing vp, mariages, or portions.
               1. For giuing names to children, beſides that it is throughout 1. Names. the Scripture for the moſt part enioyned to the husband, as to 
                     Gen. 17. 19. 
                  Abraham, to 
                     Luk. 1. 13. 
                  Zacharias, and to others, and that accordingly husbands haue ordinarily done, as 
                     Gen. 5. 3. 
                  Adam, 
                  29. 
                  Lamech, 
                  
                     & 21. 3. 
                  Abraham, and others. It is to be noted that when there was a difference betwixt the man and his wife in giuing a childes name, he giuing one name, ſhe another, the name which he gaue, ſtood; though 
                     Gen. 35. 18. 
                  Rachel named her youngeſt ſonne Benoni, yet Beniamin (which name Iaakob gaue) was the childes name. So alſo when 
                     Luk. 1. 62. 
                  Elizabeth told her friends that her childes name muſt be Iohn, they would not reſt therein, till Zacharias had ratified that name. Yea though Ioſeph were but the ſuppoſed father of Ieſus, yet becauſe he was the huſband of Mary the mother of Ieſus, 
                  
                     Mat. 1. 21. he had this honour giuen him, to giue the name vnto her childe.
               Whereas in Scripture it is ſometimes ſaid that the mothers named their children, as 
                     Gen. 29. 32. 
                  Leah, 
                  
                     & 30. 24. 
                  Rahel, and others, it is vpon the forenamed ground to be ſuppoſed that they had their husbands conſent.
               2. For appointing place and mariage it is noted that 
                     Gen. 27. 43, &c.
                   
                  Rebekah 
                  2. Place and mariage. asked the conſent of her husband: though ſhe told her ſonne Iaakob that he ſhould goe to Haran to his vncle Laban to be there kept in ſafety from the fury of Eſau, yet ſhe would not ſend him till 
                     Gen. 28. 1, 2. 
                  Iſaak had giuen his conſent for his abode there, and taking a wife from thence.
               3. For deputing vnto a calling, it is noted of 1 Sam. 1. 11. 
                  Annah, that 3. Calling. though before her childe was borne ſhe had by ſolemne vow dedicated him to the Lord, yet when the childe was borne 
                     Verſ 22. ſhe asked her husbands conſent about it. 4. Apparell.
               
               4. That which is noted of 1 Sam. 2. 19. 
                  Annahs carrying a little coat to
                  
                  her ſonne yeare by yeare when ſhe went vp with her husband, ſheweth that ſhe did it not without her husbands conſent. Women are for the moſt part prone to pranke vp their children aboue their husbands place and calling, and therefore good reaſon that therein they ſhould be gouerned by their husbands.
               
                  Obiect.
                  What if husbands be more forward to haue their children attired vainly and vnſeemely, then wiues?
                  
                     Anſw. A wife muſt doe what ſhe can to hinder it: if ſhe can no way preuaile with him, ſhe by reaſon of her ſubiection is much more excuſed, then he could be, if he would ſuffer his wife therein to haue her will.
                  5. The law that layeth the charge vpon husbands to giue 5. Portions. Deut. 21. 15, &c.
                      ſuch and ſuch portions to his children, and the anſwerable practiſe of husbands from time to time, ſhew that the wife of her ſelfe hath not power to order them.
               
            
            
               §. 40. Of a wiues 
                  Treat. 4. §. 18. 
                  ſubiection to her husband about ordering ſeruants and beaſts.
               
               If wiues muſt haue their husbands conſent in ordering and diſpoſing of their children which come out of her wombe, much more of their ſeruants.
               They may not take in, or thruſt out ſeruants againſt their husbands minde. In this point, as in many other, Sarah manifeſted her wiue-like obedience; in that 
                     Gen. 16. 5. ſhe would not deale roughly with her maid though ſhe were prouoked: much leſſe 
                     & 21. 10. put her out of doores till ſhe had made the matter knowne to her husband. Though ſhe failed in the manner, yet in the thing it ſelfe ſhe is a good example. It is further noted and approued in the 2 King. 4. 22. Shunemite that ſhe asked her husbands conſent about ſending a ſeruant with her.
               My meaning is not that ſuch wiues as haue ſeruants allowed them to attend vpon them ſhould aske their husbands conſent whenſoeuer they haue occaſion to vſe them; for their husbands by allowing them men for their attendance manifeſt their will and conſent that they may vſe them as they ſee occaſion: but that they ſhould not vſe and imploy their ſeruants in ſuch things as they know their husbands would diſlike, except they can gaine their husbands conſent.
               
                  
Againſt thoſe particulars of children and ſeruants it may be obiected, that wiues are parents of their children as well as husbands, and miſtreſſes of ſeruants as well as they maſters, and therefore haue altogether as great power ouer them as their husbands.
               
                  Anſw. Indeed if the authority of the husband come not betweene, that may be granted in relation betwixt her and them: but her power being ſubordinate to her husbands in relation to him ſhe hath not ſo great a power: the power of a wife that now we ſpeake of is directly in relation to her husband.
               The like may be ſaid of their beaſts and cattell, a particular point noted alſo in the example of the Shunemite, who hauing occaſion to vſe a beaſt went to her husband, and ſaid, ſend I pray thee with me one of the aſſes.

               §. 41. Of a wiues

                  ſubiection in entertaining ſtrangers iournying abroad, and making vowes.
               
               If wiues may not at their pleaſure vſe the things appertaining to the houſe, much leſſe may they bring ſtrangers into the houſe and entertaine them without or againſt their huſbands conſent. The good Shunemite ſo often named as a preſident 2 King. 4. 10. for good wiues, firſt asked her husbands conſent, before ſhe lodged a Prophet of the Lord.
               The ſame patterne is alſo commended vnto wiues to moue them not to iourney abroad without their husbands conſent. For though that good wife had a very weighty and iuſt occaſion 2 King. 4. 22. to goe vnto the Prophet, yet ſhe would not before ſhe knew her husbands minde.
               As for a wiues power to make vowes, in that the law giueth an husband power to diſanull her vow when he knoweth it, it implieth that ſhe ought to haue his conſent in making it, if 
                     Num. 30. 9. at leaſt ſhe deſire to haue it eſtabliſhed, which ſhe ought to deſire, or elſe ſhe mocketh God.
               I haue thought good to mention theſe particular points for illuſtration of a wiues ſubiection, becauſe they are all of them grounded on Gods word: many other might be added to them, but theſe are ſufficient.
            
            
               
               §. 42. Of aberrations contrary to a wiues ſubiection in doing things without or againſt their husbands conſent.
               
               Now conſider we the vſuall vices and aberrations contrary to thoſe duties: the generall ſumme of all is, for a wife to take on her to doe what ſhe liſt, whether her husband will or no, either not willing that he ſhould know what ſhe doth, or not caring though it be againſt his minde and will. Of this ſort are
               1. Such as priuily take money out of their husbands cloſets, 1. Priuy purloyning huſbands goods. counters, or other like places where he laieth it, neuer telling him of it, nor willing that he ſhould know it: likewiſe ſuch as after the like manner take ware out of the ſhop, corne out of the garner, ſheepe out of the flocke, or any other goods to ſell and make money of: or to giue away, or otherwiſe to vſe ſo as their husbands ſhall neuer know, if they can hinder it. Such wiues herein ſinne hainouſly, and that in many reſpects.
               Firſt they diſobey the ordinance of God in a maine branch of their particular calling, which is ſubiection.
               
               2. They ill repay the care and paines which their husbands take for their good. Many ſuch wiues recompence euill for good, which is a deuilliſh qualitie.
               3. They are oft a meanes to impaire and impoueriſh their husbands eſtate.
               4. They ſhew themſelues no better then

All that can be iuſtly and truly ſaid for their right in the common goods, cannot defend them from the guilt of theft: they are the more dangerous by how much the more they are truſted, and leſſe ſuſpected: and their fact is ſo much the more hainous by how much the more deere their husbands ought to be vnto them.
               5. They are a verie ill example to other inferiours in the houſe, for ſeldome hath a man a deceitfull wife, but ſome of the children or ſeruants, are made acceſſarie thereunto, being made her inſtruments to take the goods, and beſtow them as ſhe ordereth, and ſo are made vnfaithfull.
               6. They make themſelues ſlaues to their owne children and

ſeruants, whom they dare not diſpleaſe, leſt they ſhould tell what was done.
               7. They teach their children and ſeruants to be theeues: for beſides that ſuch as are vſed by their miſtreſſes to purloine for them, are thereby made acceſſarie to their ſinne, they will alſo purloine for themſelues, when their miſtreſſes ſhall not know. So as what with the wiues purloining one way, and the childrens or ſeruants another way, a mans eſtate may be waſted as dew before the Sunne, and he not know which way.
               2. Such as will haue what allowance they thinke beſt for 2. Taking what allowance they liſt. themſelues and family, and ſcornfully ſay, They will not be at their husbands finding: they know beſt what allowance is fitteſt for the family, and that it ſhall haue. Many will make their huſbands eare tingle againe, yea and make the whole houſe (if not the ſtreet alſo) ring of it, if they thinke their allowance be not anſwerable to the vttermoſt extent of their husbands eſtate. This impatiencie and inſolencie, as it croſſeth Gods ordinance, ſo it maketh both their liues vncomfortable.
               3. Such as cocker, attire, or any way bring vp their children 3. Ordering children againſt their husbands minde. otherwiſe then their husbands would, euen to the griefe and diſhonour of their husbands: keeping them at home when their husbands, for their better education, would haue them abroad: as theſe ſinne in hindring the good of their children, ſo alſo in not yeelding to their husbands. 4. Ordering ſeruants againſt their husbands minde.
               
               4. Such as will haue their owne will about ſeruants, taking in, and putting out whom they pleaſe, and when they pleaſe: vſing ſome ſeruants whom they finde for their turne to the preiudice of their husbands: and carying themſelues ſo ſharply 5. Lending forth their husbands cattell. and ſhrewiſhly to others that are for their husbands turne, as a good, truſtie, faithfull ſeruant cannot long ſtay in the houſe.
               5. Such as ſecretly lend out their husbands horſes, or other 6. Feaſting when their husbands ſhall not know it. Abſente marito compotationes domi ne excita. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp.
                   like cattell, more reſpecting to pleaſure a vaine friend, then to pleaſe a good husband. This fault is ſo much the greater, when it is done to the dammage and preiudice of the husband.
               6. Such as are then moſt frolicke and iolly, when their huſbands are furtheſt off and cannot know it. Salomon ſets it downe as a note of a ſtrumpet,

                  Thus farre of the firſt branch of a wiues ſubmiſſion in abſtaining from doing things without her husbands conſent. The ſecond followeth, in doing the things which herequireth.
               
            
            
               
               §. 43. Of a wiues actiue Obedience.
               
               It is a good proofe and triall of a wiues obedience, to abſtaine from doing ſuch things as otherwiſe ſhe would doe, if her huſbands contrarie will did not reſtraine her: but yet that is not ſufficient, there muſt be an actiue, as well as a paſſiue obedience yeelded. That old Law before mentioned (thy deſire ſhall be ſubiect to thine husband, and he ſhall rule ouer thee) implieth ſo much alſo. If ſhe refuſe to doe what he would haue her to doe, her deſire is not ſubiect to him, but to her ſelfe, neither doth he rule ouer her.
               This actiue part of her obedience hath reſpect
               1. To his commandements, readily to doe what he lawfully A wiues actiue obedience reſpecteth firſt her husbands commandement. commands.
               2. To his reproofes, carefully to redreſſe what he iuſtly blameth.
               For the firſt, ſo farre ought a wife to be from thinking ſcorne to be commanded by her husband, that the very knowledge which by any meanes ſhe hath of her husbands minde and will, 
                     •
                  ought to haue the force of a ſtraight commandement with her. This readineſſe to obey is commended in the wiues of Iaakob, to whom when Iaakob had declared what motiues he had to depart from their fathers houſe, intimating thereby that he meant to depart, and would haue them to goe with him, yet before he particularly expreſſed his will, they readily anſwered, Whatſoeuer God 
                  
                     Gen. 31. 16. 
                  hath ſaid vnto thee, doe: whereby they gaue him to vnderſtand that they were ready to yeeld vnto whatſoeuer he would haue done.
            
            
               §. 44. Of a wiues willingneſſe to 
                  Treat. 4. §. 18. 
                  dwell where her husband will.
               
               To make this part of a wiues obedience ſomewhat more cleare, I will exemplifie it by two or three particular inſtances, recorded and approued in Gods word.
               The firſt is, that a wife ought to be willing to dwell where her husband will haue her dwell.
               
               The wiues of Abraham, Iſaak, and Iaakob, herein manifeſted their wiue-like obedience: though their husbands brought them from their owne countrey, and from their fathers houſe, yet they refuſed not to goe with them, but dwelt in a ſtrange countrey, and that in tents.
               
                  
Note in particular what Iaakobs wiues ſay to their husband in this caſe, Is there any portion or inheritance for vs in our fathers 
                  
                     Gen. 31. 14. 
                  houſe? implying thereby, that ſeeing it was their husbands pleaſure to be gone, they would not any longer tarry in their fathers houſe, to looke for any more portion or inheritance there.
               Theſe examples doe further ſhew that if an husband haue iuſt occaſion to remoue from one country to another, and in thoſe countries from place to place, his wife ought to yeeld to goe with him, if he require it at her hands. Note what the Apoſtle ſaith, haue we not power to lead about a wife? That interrogation 1 Cor. 9. 5. implieth a ſtrong aſſeueration. The husband then hauing power to lead about a wife from place to place, ſhe ought to ſubmit her ſelfe to that power. This clauſe (as well as other Apoſtles, and as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas) ſheweth, that this was not only a power which might be vſed, but which was vſed by huſbands, and yeelded vnto by wiues.
               
                  
                     Obiect. The forenamed examples are extraordinary, and that vpon extraordinary occaſions.
                  
                     Anſw. Yet they may be patternes for ordinary occaſions which are lawfull and warrantable. Was it not an extraordinary fact of Eliah to pray firſt that there might be no raine, and 
                        Iam. 5. 17. then againe that there might be raine? yet is this propounded as a generall patterne to moue vs to pray for things lawfull.
                  Now in laying downe this dutie I added the clauſe and caueat of iuſt occaſion, to meet both with ſuch as vpon diſcontent, or ſuperſtition, leaue the land where the true Goſpell is maintained, and preached, and goe into idolatrous places: and alſo with ſuch wandring giddy heads as only to ſatisfie their owne humour, and to ſee faſhions, as we ſpeake, can neuer reſt in a place, but are continually remouing from countrey to countrey, and from place to place: I thinke (to vſe the words of the Apoſtle) a wife is not vnder bondage in ſuch caſeſ. 
                     1 Cor. 7. 15.
                  
                  But if a man be ſent of an ambaſſage by his Prince, or countrey: or if a Preacher or Profeſſor be called into another countrey, as Bucer and Peter Martyr were into England in King Edwards daies (which to this day is vſuall in other countries) or if a man be adiudged vnto long impriſonment, and

vpon theſe and other like occaſions ſhall require his wife to be with him, ſhe ought in dutie to yeeld vnto his demand.
                  Contrary is the minde and practiſe of many wiues, who Contrary, when a wife makes her huſband dwell where ſhe will. being affected and addicted to one place more then another, as to the place where they were bred and brought vp, where their greateſt, beſt, and moſt friends dwell, and where they haue good acquaintance, refuſe to goe and dwell where their husbands calling lieth, though he require, and deſire them neuer ſo much. Thus many husbands are forced to their great dammage for peace ſake to yeeld vnto their wiues, and ſo either to relinquiſh their calling, or to haue two houſes; whence it followeth, that ſometimes they muſt neglect their ſeruants and calling, and ſometimes be abſent from their wiues, if not from their children alſo. Some wiues pretend that they cannot endure the ſmoake of the citie, other that they cannot endure the aire of the countrie: whereas indeed their owne humour and conceit ſtuffes them more then either citie ſmoake or countrie aire. I cannot call ſuch the daughters of Sarah herein: 1 Pet. 3. 5, 6. they are not like thoſe forenamed holy women that truſted in God, and were ſubiect to their husbands, but rather like to that light houſewife of the Leuite, who would not dwell in her huſbands 
                        Iudg. 19. 2. houſe at mount Ephraim, but at her fathers houſe in Beth-lehem Iudah. Such wiues as I ſpeake of, in matrimoniall chaſtitie may be more honeſt, but in wiuelike ſubiection are little more dutifull. Let this be taken for a fault, and it will be the ſooner amended.

                  Treat. 4. §. 29. 
                  readineſſe to come to her husband when he requires it.
               
               Another particular inſtance of a wiues readineſſe to yeeld vnto her husbands commandement is, to come to her husband when her husband requireth it, either by calling her, or ſending for her. The forenamed 
                     Gen. 31. 4. wiues of Iaakob being ſent for to their husband in the field where he was, made no excuſe, but came preſently. So farre ought wiues herein to ſubiect their wills to their husbands, that though it may ſeeme to them ſome diſparagement to come, yet if their husbands will haue it ſo they muſt yeeld, otherwiſe they ſeeme euen to 
                     Eſth. 1. 17. 
                  deſpiſe their husbands.
               
               
                  
Contrary is Vaſhtie-like ſtoutneſſe, when wiues thinke and Contrary, ſtoutneſſe in refuſing to come. ſay, it is a ſeruants part to come when they are called or ſent for, and they will neuer yeeld to be their husbands ſeruants, to come at his command. By the ſame reaſon may all duties of ſubiection be reiected. But for this particular, let ſuch ſtout

                   royally deſcended, being the daughter of a King. Secondly, ſhe was then among the honourable women of the kingdome. Thirdly, the King was in drinke when he ſent for her. Fourthly, he ſent for her to ſhew her beautie before multitudes of men, which was not ſeemely. But all theſe were not ſufficient to excuſe her fault, and free her from blame. Firſt, though ſhe were of royall parentage, yet ſhe was a wife, and her husband ſent for her. Secondly, being among the noble women of the kingdome, ſhe ſhould the rather haue ſhewed her ſelfe a patterne of ſubiection in this kinde. Thirdly, though he were in drinke, yet remained he an husband: and the thing which he commanded was not ſuch but that ſhe might haue done it without ſinne. Fourthly, if ſhe thought the thing vnſeemely, ſhe ſhould firſt haue vſed all the faire meanes ſhe could to haue beene ſpared; but if by all ſhe could not haue preuailed, then (the thing being not ſimplie vnlawfull and a ſinne) ſhe ſhould haue yeelded.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Her fault was not in that as a wife ſhe came not to her husband, but in that as a ſubiect ſhe came not to her Soueraigne.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. Her fault was in both: and in the iudgement paſſed againſt her, that former was moſt vrged, namely that by her 
                        Esth. 1. 17. example all women might learne to deſpiſe their husbands.

                  2. Though they were heathen, yet they ſhewed what ſubiection

is required of wiues to their husbands by the very light of nature, whereby this ſinne is aggrauated.
                  3. Abimelech was but a heathen man, yet his ſentence concerning a womans ſubiection in theſe words, he is to thee a 
                     
                        Gen. 20. 16. 
                     couering of the eyes, is taken to be iudicious, and being approued by the holy Ghoſt, to be a good proofe. As for that particular of Uaſhtie, why is it ſo largely recorded in the Scripture but for inſtruction, and admonition vnto wiues?
               
            
            
               §. 46. Of a wiues readineſſe to 
                  Treat. §. 29. 
                  doe what her husband requireth.
               
               A third particular inſtance of a wiues readineſſe to yeeld vnto her husbands commandement, is, to performe what buſineſſe he requireth of her. When of a ſudden there came three men to Abram, and he was deſirous to entertaine them, he bid his wife make readie quickly three meaſures of meale, &c. and ſhe 
                     Gen. 18. 6. did it accordingly. Ieroboam hauing a weightie occaſion to ſend to Ahijah the Prophet, thought it meet to ſend by his 1 King. 14. 2, &c.
                   wife, ſhe accordingly (though a Queene) went: ſhe did as her husband would haue her.
               Contrary is the humour of many wiues who will not doe Contrary, ſtubbornneſſe in refuſing to doe a thing vpon command. any thing vpon command. If ſuch a wiues husband being deſirous to entertaine a friend on the ſudden, ſhall vſe Abrams phraſe, make readie quickly, &c. ſhe will ſay, let him come and doe it himſelfe, if he will haue it ſo quickly done, I will not be his drudge: or if, hauing a matter of moment and ſecrecie, he will his wife her ſelfe to doe it, ſhe will reply, I am none of your ſeruants; cannot you put it to one of them, or doe it your ſelfe? Yet will ſuch wiues be ready to command their husbands to doe euery toy, and if he doe it not, they can reply, is this ſuch a matter? and may not a wife ſpeake to her husband? Were the point of obedience well learned, it would caſt ſuch wiues into another mould.
               Theſe few particulars may ſerue for direction in many hundreds. I proceed to the other part of a wiues actiue obedience, which reſpecteth the reproofes of her husband.
            
            
               §. 47. Of a wiues 
                  Treat. 4. §. 34, 35. 
                  meeke taking a reproofe.
               
               The husband hauing authoritie ouer his wife, by vertue thereof he hath power, yea it is his dutie as there is needfull

cauſe to rebuke her: By iuſt conſequence therefore it followeth, A wiues actiue obedience to her husbands reproofe. The beſt triall of obedience. that it is her dutie to yeeld obedience thereunto. Which ought the rather to be done becauſe the chiefeſt triall of ſound obedience lieth herein. For nothing goeth ſo much againſt ones ſtomach as reproofe: ſhe that yeelds when ſhe is rebuked, will much more when ſhe is intreated. This point of obedience is manifeſted two waies.
               1. By meekneſſe in taking a reproofe.
               2. By endeuour to redreſſe what is iuſtly reproued. The very point of obedience eſpecially conſiſteth in this latter: the former is as a good preparatiue thereunto, without which it will hardly be done, at leaſt not well done.
               Meekneſſe in this caſe is one of the moſt principall fruits of 1. She muſt meekly take reproofe. 1 Pet. 3. 4. Gen. 30. 1. that meeke and quiet ſpirit which S. Peter commendeth vnto wiues. Howſoeuer Rachel iuſtly deſerued blame for comming in a fuming chafe, and with an imperious command to her husband, yet in that ſhe meekly tooke his ſharpe reproofe (for ſhe replied not againſt it, but meekly gaue a direction for the better accompliſhment of her deſire) her example is commendable: commendable I ſay, not in the matter of her direction, but in her patient bearing of reproofe.
               Much wiſdome may be learned hereby: for when any Wiſdome learned. meekly take a reproofe, thereby they ſuppreſſe their paſſion, and keepe it from riſing as a cloud before their vnderſtanding and darkning it, and ſo may they better iudge of the matter reproued whether it be iuſt or no: and whether it need redreſſe or no: whereof they who are impatient of reproofe, and fret and fume againſt it, cannot ſo well iudge. The virgin Mary made good vſe of Chriſts reprouing her, and thereby 
                     Joh. 2. 4, 5. learned and taught a good point of wiſdome, namely ſo to referre our affaires to Chriſt as we expect his pleaſure; and not preſcribe time, meanes, manner, or any other like circumſtances vnto him.
               
                  
                     Queſt. What if the husbands reproofe be bitter? 
                        Suadeo mulieribus vt viros etiam aſperiores perſerant. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1. Cor. 11.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. He therein forgets his place, yet thereupon ſhe muſt not forget her duty. If Iaakobs reproofe be well noted, we ſhall finde it very tart, for it is expreſly ſaid that his anger was kindle
                           •
                         againſt her, (Gen. 30. 2.) ſo as he ſpake in anger: the manner

and forme of his words being with an interrogation, and the Excandeſcenti marito cede, & molli oratione iuva. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp. matter alſo, am I in Gods ſtead, &c. declare tartneſſe: yet (as was declared before) ſhe ſhewed meekneſe.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. What if his reproofe be vniuſt?
                  2. Anſw. Yet may not meekneſſe be forgotten. In ſuch a caſe a wife may make a iuſt apologie to cleare her owne innocencie, and manifeſt her husbands error: but if he refuſe to heare her, or will not beleeue her, then (as S. Peter ſpeaketh in another 1 Pet. 2. 19, 20. caſe) ſhe muſt endure griefe for conſcience toward God.
                  
                  The two reaſons which there he rendreth in that other caſe may not vnfitly be applied to this.
                  1. In generall this is thank-worthy, it is a grace, a glory to 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . her: a matter that deſerueth praiſe and commendation.
                  2. In particular it is acceptable to God: howſoeuer their huſbands 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . may deale roughly and vntowardly with them, yet God will graciouſly reſpect them, if they ſhall patiently in obedience to his ordinance beare their husbands vniuſt reproofes.
                  3. I may adde this reaſon alſo, that thus they ſhall ſhew themſelues good Chriſtians indeed, in that they are not ouercome 
                     
                        Rom. 12. 21. 
                     of euill.
                  
                  Contrary is their minde who by no meanes will brooke a rebuke at their husbands hands: it skills not whether it be iuſt or vniuſt: if their husbands reproue them, they ſhall be ſure to haue the reproofe rebounded backe againe vpon their faces, and that with greater violence then euer it came from them. There be ſome that ſeeme to be very good wiues till they be tried by the touch-ſtone of reproofe: but then though the reproofe be for matter moſt iuſt, for manner moſt milde, and that in priuate betwixt their husbands and themſelues, yet they grow ſo impatient, or rather mad, as they forbeare not to giue their husbands the moſt ſcornfull ſpeeches that they can inuent, vſing withall bitter imprecations and execrations, and threaten to drowne or hang themſelues if they be croſſed of their wills. Yea further, if wiſe husbands ſhall forbeare them in their paſſion, and after it is allaied tell them how vnbeſeeming their places they carried themſelues, they will ſeeke to iuſtifie themſelues, and lay all the blame on their husbands for croſſing them in their will: or if they cannot but ſee their

fault, yet they will only ſay, it is my infirmitie: but yet euer continue in that infirmitie: and though they make ſhew of fearing God, yet labour not to purge this corrupt humour out of their hearts. Hence is it for the moſt part that contentions ariſe betwixt man and wife. If wiues would learne in this point to be ſubiect, many iarres, which from time to time ariſe betwixt them, would be allaied, if not preuented. Michal 
                     2 Sam. 6. 20, &c. Iob 2. 10. the wife of Dauid, and Iobs wife (though they gaue iuſt occaſion to be moſt ſharply reproued, yet) ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt theſe wiues, becauſe they were ſilent after they were reproued, and replied not. Salomon oft titles ſuch as cannot beare rebuke ſcorners: ſo as hereby wiues ſhew that 
                        Prou 9. 7, 8. they are very ſcornfull.

                  readineſſe to redreſſe what her husband iuſtly reproueth in her.
               
               A further degree of obedience in bearing reproofe is, that 2 She muſt redreſſe what is iuſtly reproued. 
                  a wife readily redreſſe what is iuſtly reproued by her husband: I ſay iuſtly, becauſe where no fault is, there needs no amendment: patience may be needfull (as was before ſhewed) but no repentance of that which is not amiſſe. But where any thing is amiſſe, there muſt be a redreſſe. Rachel did amiſſe in 
                     Gen. 31. 19. bringing Idols into her husbands houſe: her husband in 
                     & 35. 2, 4. bidding her among others to put away their ſtrange gods, reproued them all. Whereupon ſhe with all the reſt gaue to him all their ſtrange gods. This was a good redreſſe.
               A reproofe may be iuſtly giuen either for a good dutie omitted; or for an euill thing committed: and accordingly muſt the redreſſe or amendment be. A dutie formerly omitted muſt after the reproofe be more carefully obſerued and performed, if it be a continuall dutie, and may be againe performed: otherwiſe the redreſſe is a teſtification of true ſorrow for that fault. When an euill is committed, if any meanes can be vſed to make vp the hurt, and redreſſe the miſchiefe that followed thereupon, it muſt be done: if not, ſorrow as before, muſt be teſtified, and care taken that the ſame, or the like be not committed againe.
               As a good conſcience requireth as much of all Chriſtians by whomſoeuer they be reproued, ſo the reſpect which a wife

oweth to an husband doth after an eſpeciall manner require it. Otherwiſe her fault is doubled, 1. by continuance in her ſin;
               2. by diſobedience to her husband.
               Contrary is their ſpirit who for reproofe waxe the worſe: Contrary, to be worſe for reprouing. Prou. 9. 8. being like thoſe ſcorners (of whom Salomon ſpeaketh) that hate thoſe that reproue them. It is the ſpeech of ſome wiues, that if their husbands would let them alone they would doe the better: but vpon rebuke they will neuer amend: the more their husbands finde fault, the more will they goe on, in doing what they doe. What other iudgement can be giuen of ſuch, then that which the wiſe man giueth, there is more hope

                  Treat. 4. §. 50 
                  contentment with her husbands preſent eſtate. Of ſubmiſſion hitherto.
               
                  Contentment is alſo a part of obedience: it hath reſpect to a mans outward eſtate and abilitie, in and with which a wife muſt reſt ſatisfied and contented, whether it be high or low, great or meane, wealthy or needy, aboue, equall, or vnder that eſtate wherein ſhe was before mariage: yea though a man haue beene ſometimes great in eſtate, yet, if he decay therein, and be brought to a meane eſtate, ſhe ought to reſt content. Thus much Iob implieth in his replie to his wife, ſaying, ſhall we receiue 
                  
                     Job 2. 10. expounded. 
                  good at the hand of God, and not receiue euill? The euill he ſpeaketh of was the loſſe of his goods, ſeruants, and children, together with other miſeries that Satan through Gods permiſſion inflicted vpon him: the receiuing of euill which he ſpeaketh of was a reſting content with it, and a patient bearing of it. Euill may be laid on any, and ſo they forced to beare it: but they only receiue it, who are content with it. Now in that he vſeth the plurall number (WE) and ſpeaking to his wife ſaith (ſhall not we receiue euill) he ſheweth that his wife ought as well as he to haue reſt contented in that poore and miſerable eſtate: For
               1. Man and wife being one fleſh, by vertue of their matrimoniall vnion, both his aduancement, and alſo his abaſement is hers: as ſhe riſeth with him, ſo ſhe falleth with him. Wherefore as ſhe is willing to be aduanced with him, ſo ſhe muſt be content to be abaſed with him.
               2. If at the time of mariage her husband was of meaner eſtate

then ſhe, ſhe voluntarily put her ſelfe into that meane eſtate: for a wife taketh her husband (as he her) for better for worſe, for richer for poorer. And ſhall ſhe not be content with her own act? If after mariage his eſtate decay, and wax meaner then it was, ſhe is to be perſwaded that by God it was ſo ordered, and that God aimed at her humiliation as well as his: and thereupon ſhe ought in her dutifull ſubmiſſion to Gods ouer-ruling prouidence to be patient and content: this Iob implieth vnder this phraſe, ſhall we not receiue euill at the hand of God? and vnder this, The Lord taketh away.
               
               3. A wiues contentment is a great eaſe to her husband lying vnder a croſſe: and it maketh the burden ſeeme much lighter then otherwiſe it would, if at leaſt he be a kinde husband, and affected with his wiues paſſion, as he ought to be. For a louing husband in euery diſtreſſe is more perplexed for his wife, then for himſelfe.
            
            
               §. 50. Of wiues diſcontent at their husbands eſtate.
               
               Contrary is the impatiencie, and diſcontent of wiues at Diſcontent manifeſted. the meanneſſe, and (as they thinke) baſeneſſe of their husbands eſtate: which is many waies manifeſted.
               1. Some when they are maried finding their husbands eſtate 1. By repenting their mariage. weaker then they imagined, repent their mariage, and ſticke not to tell their husbands, that if they had before knowne them to be no better men then they finde them to be, they ſhould haue beene no husbands for them. Wherein firſt they bewray their fooliſh indiſcretion by ſaying, when it is too late, if I had 
                  
                     Non eſt ſapientis dicere non putâram. Cic. Offic. lib. 1. 
                  thought this; and withall they manifeſt their own raſhneſſe and vnaduiſedneſſe, in that they gaue their hands and plighted their troth to thoſe whom they knew not. If they ſay, they were deceiued by their friends whom they put in truſt, I anſwer that mariage is too weightie a matter to be wholly referred ouer to the truſt of friends: euery one that yeeldeth to be maried, ought wel to know the party vnto whom in this caſe they yeeld: and aboue all they ought to ſeeke direction, helpe, and bleſſing from God. If notwithſtanding all the meanes which poſſibly they could vſe, they be deceiued, they are to looke vnto God, and to behold his prouidence therein: and duly to weigh whether the Lord haue croſſed their deſire for their

humiliation, or for triall of their patience, wiſdome and other like graces, or elſe to weine them from ſome vaine and worldly delights, whereunto they were too much addicted.
               2. Others obſeruing their husbands eſtate to be decaied 2. By impatient cariage. and waſted, neuer ſearch after the occaſion, but lay all the blame vpon their husbands, and with their diſcontented lookes, paſſionate words, and impatient cariage, ſo vex their hearts, as they make the croſſe much more heauy then otherwiſe it could be. Though the eſtate ſhould be ouerthrowne by the vnthriftineſſe of an husband, yet ought a wife to looke vnto Gods prouidence therein, as was noted before.
               3. Others ſcorning to ſtoope, and to come downe to their 3. By refuſing to ſtoope. husbands preſent condition, through their pride and vaineglory are a great means to make his eſtate much the worſe: for they, ſo long as by any meanes they can get it, will not abate any thing of their braue apparell, dainty cheere, rich furniture, and other like things, which are cauſes of great expence to their husbands: hereby alſo it commeth oft to paſſe that huſbands are thought to be wealthier then indeed they are, and ſo greater taxations and charges then they can beare are laid vpon them for King, Countrey, Church, Poore, and the like.
               4. Others, through diſcontent lie long lazing in their beds, 4. By refuſing to helpe. or idly ſit ſtill when they are vp, and will not take any whit the more paines to raiſe vp and increaſe their husbands eſtate: whereby God is prouoked more and more to weaken their eſtates, that ſo he may the more puniſh ſuch pride and lazineſſe in wiues.

                  Treat. 4. §. 26. 
                  caſes wherein a wife ought not to forbeare what her husband forbiddeth.
               
               So much of the diſtinct branches of a wiues ſubiection. The limitation and manner of performing it next followeth.
               To know the limitation of a wiues obedience, and the manner how ſhe ought to yeeld ſubiection vnto her husband, two things muſt be conſidered:

                     1. The place of an husband.
                     2. The place of a wife.
                  
               
               The husbands place is noted in this phraſe, as to the Lord: 
                  
                     Eph. 5. 22. whereby is ſhewed that the husband euen by vertue of his

place is to his wife in Chriſts ſtead: which is further more plainly laid downe in theſe words following, the husband is 
                  
                     Verſ. 23. 
                  the head of the wife, as Chriſt is the head of the Church.
               
               The wiues place is intimated in theſe words, as the Church 
                  
                     Verſ. 24. 
                  is ſubiect vnto Chriſt, ſo let wiues be to their owne husbands: whereby it is cleere that the obedience which a wife performeth to her husband muſt be ſuch an obedience as the Church performeth to Chriſt.
               From the place of an husband, I gather this generall ground concerning a wiues ſubiection, that
               
                  Subiection muſt be yeelded to the husband as to Chriſt, whence will follow two concluſions, one negatiue, which is this,
               
                  The wife muſt yeeld no other ſubiection to her husband then what may ſtand with her ſubiection to Chriſt.
               
               The other affirmatiue, which is this,
               
                  The wife muſt ſubiect her ſelfe to her husband in that manner that ſhe would or ſhould ſubiect her ſelfe to Chriſt.
               
               The former is a neceſſary condition required of all inferiours in their ſubiection, and obedience (as I ſhewed Treat. 1. §. 6. before) much more in a wiues ſubiection to her husband, becauſe there is of all vnequals See §. 4. of this Treat. the leaſt diſparity betwixt husbands and wiues.
               Hence for our preſent purpoſe, I gather theſe two other more particular concluſions, The firſt whereof is this,
               1. If God expreſly command the wife any duty, and her huſband will not by any meanes giue conſent that ſhe ſhall doe it, but forbid her, ſhe may and ought to doe it without, or againſt his conſent.
               
               Two cautions are warily to be obſerued about this concluſion: 2. Cautions for limiting a wiues perſiſting to doe that which her husband forbids.
               
               1. That the wife be ſure that God hath commanded her that which ſhe doth without or againſt her husbands conſent. If ſhe doubt, then ſhe muſt ſtay, and for beare till ſhe gaine his conſent. When two oppoſite caſes meet together, and the one be doubtfull, the other plaine and expreſſe: the doubtfull caſe muſt giue place to the more euident. Now the law of ſubiection is indefinite, thy deſire ſhall be ſubiect to thine huſband; 
                  
                     Gen 3 16. the extent of it is generall, in euery thing; the only reſeruation and exception is in the Lord; wherefore if the wife

be not ſure that that which her husband forbiddeth her is againſt the Lord, ſhe muſt forbeare to doe it.
               The ſecond caution is that ſhe vſe all good meanes ſhe can to gaine her husbands conſent, before ſhe doe, euen that which is commanded, againſt his conſent. Thus ſhall ſhe teſtifie her ſubiection both to God and her husband. To God, in that nothing can keepe her from doing his expreſſe commandement: ſhe will rather offend her husband then God, when one of them muſt needs be offended. To her husband, in that ſhe putteth it to the vttermoſt puſh, and vſeth all the meanes ſhe can to auoid his offence, in ſo much as he himſelfe might ſee (if the god of this world blinded not his eies) that the offence is no way giuen on her part, but meerely taken on his.
               For proofe of this, it is without all contradiction true, that the wife is not bound to greater ſubiection vnto her huſband then the ſubiect is vnto the magiſtrate: but a ſubiect ought not to forbeare a bounden duty commanded of God, becauſe his gouernour forbids him. Inſtance the example of Daniel, 
                  
                     Dan. 6. 7, &c.
                   who daily made his praiers to God, though the King had made a ſolemne decree that none ſhould aske any petition of God or man within thirty daies but of the king. Inſtance alſo the Apoſtles, 
                     Act. 4. 18, &c.
                   who preached the Goſpel, thogh they were expreſly forbiddē.
               Though the Scripture be plentifull in affording examples of wiues ſubiection, yet it is very ſparing in recording examples of thoſe who in ſuch warrantable caſes refuſed to be ſubiect, leſt wiues from thence ſhould take too great liberty.
               Some are recorded, but ſuch as are either extraordinary, or not euery way inſtifiable. Abigails example was extraordinary, 1 Sam. 25. 18. and therfore not imitable but in ſuch like extraordinary caſes.
               The example of Rebekah, which may ſeeme ſomewhat more 
                     Gen. 27. 6. pertinent, is not euery way to be iuſtified. For though the thing which ſhe intended were for the ſubſtance of it very good, and ought to haue beene done, namely the bleſſing of Iaakob, (for God foreſhewed that the bleſſing appertained to Iaakob, in that he ſaid, The elder ſhall ſerue the younger) yet 
                     Gen. 25. 23. becauſe ſhe put not her husband in minde of Gods word, nor laboured to perſwade him to fulfill the ſame, but went about the matter deceitfully, ſhe cannot therein be iuſtified. But in

the generall this example ſheweth that Gods word muſt be yeelded vnto rather then an husbands will.
               For better application of this point I will lay downe ſome particular inſtances agreeable to Gods word. Suppoſe a wife well inſtructed in the true religion be maried to an idolatrous or profane husband, and he without any iuſt cauſe forbid her to goe to the Church, eſpecially on the Lords daies, to pray in Engliſh, to read the word, to teach her children the principles of religion, to reſtore that which ſhe hath vniuſtly and fraudulently gotten, with the like, ſhe may, and muſt doe them notwithſtanding.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Why may not giuing of almes be reckoned among theſe?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. Becauſe the husband hath a greater power ouer the goods, then ouer theſe things.
                  2. Becauſe almes-giuing is not ſimply commanded to all, but to ſuch as haue wherewithall to giue: but theſe things are ſimply commanded to all.
               
            
            
               §. 52. Of caſes wherein a wife ought to forbeare what her husband requireth.
               
               The other particular concluſion is this, that
               
                  If an husband require his wife to doe that which God hath forbidden ſhe ought not to doe it.
               
               Two cautions like the former are likewiſe to be obſerued 2. Cautions for limiting a wiues refuſing to doe that which her husband commands. about this point.
               Firſt, that ſhe be ſure (being truly informed by Gods word) that that which ſhe refuſeth to doe at her husbands command, is forbidden by God.
               Secondly, that ſhe firſt labour with all meekeneſſe and by all good meanes that ſhe can to diſſwade her husband from vrging and preſſing that vpon her, which with a good conſcience ſhe cannot doe.
               A like proofe may be brought for this as was for the former: for we know that a wife is not bound vnto greater ſubiection to her husband then a ſonne is vnto a father: but a ſonne may in the caſe propounded forbeare to doe that which his father requireth and commandeth him to doe: inſtance the approued example of Ionathan, who refuſed to bring Dauid 
                  1 Sam. 20. 31.
                  
vnto Saul to be ſlaine, though his father commanded him ſo to doe. I might alſo inſtance the ſame in Sauls ſubiects and 1 Sam. 22. 17. ſeruants, who refuſed to ſlay the Prieſts of the Lord at his command. Though an husband be not reckoned in particular among thoſe to whom we are forbidden to hearken if they 
                     Deut. 13. 6. intice vs to idolatry, yet by the rule of relation he is implied, and by iuſt conſequence gathered from this clauſe, thy friend which is as thine owne ſoule; for who ſo deare as an husband?
               To exemplifie this in ſome particulars as I did the former, If an husband ſhall command his wife to goe to Maſſe, to a ſtage play, to play at dice, to proſtitute her body to vncleannes, to goe gariſhly and whoriſhly attired, to ſell by ſcant weights, ſhort meaſures, or the like, ſhe ought not to doe ſo.
            
            
               §. 53. Of wiues faults in ſhewing more reſpect to their huſbands then to God.
               
               Contrary to this limitation is on the one ſide a fawning flattering diſpoſition of ſuch wiues as ſeeke to pleaſe their husbands, ſo as they care not to diſpleaſe God, (Iezabel was ſuch an one; to pleaſe her husband moſt lewdly ſhe did 1 Ki. 21. 7. &c.
                   practiſe Naboths death) and on the other ſide a fainting timorous heart which maketh them feare their husbands more then they feare God. Good Sarah, that worthy preſident of 
                     Gen. 12. 13. &c.
                   good wiues in other things, ſomewhat failed herein. Did wiues duly conſider, and alwaies remember that they haue an husband (namely Chriſt) in heauen, as well as on earth, and that there is greater difference betwixt that and this husband, then betwixt heauen and earth, and that both in giuing reward, and taking reuenge, there is no compariſon betwixt them, their care of pleaſing, or their feare of offending their husband in heauen would be much more then of pleaſing, or offending their husband on earth: if any thing were commanded or forbidden them by their husbands on earth againſt Chriſt, they would ſay, If I doe this, or forbeare that, I ſhould worke falſhood againſt mine owne ſoule; for nothing can be hid from mine husband in heauen: yea I ſhould herein obey Satan, rather then God.
            
            
               §. 54. Of the manner of a wiues ſubiection to her husband.
               
               The ſecond generall concluſion concerning the manner of a

wiues ſubiection, which was gathered from the place of an husband, was this, that
               
                  The wife muſt ſubiect her ſelfe to her husband in that manner, that ſhe would or ſhould ſubiect her ſelfe to Chriſt. The particle As in this clauſe (as vnto the Lord) importeth ſo much.
               This verie concluſion is alſo inferred out of the place of a wife: In the ſame place that the Church is to Chriſt, a wife is to an husband: therefore ſuch ſubiection as the Church yeeldeth to Chriſt, muſt a wife yeeld to her husband; which the verie words of the Apoſtle doe expreſly affirme. Now we 
                     Epheſ. 5. 24. know that euerie Chriſtian wife in her particular ought to yeeld that obedience to Chriſt which the Church in generall doth: therefore alſo ſhe muſt yeeld ſuch ſubiection to her huſband as ſhe ſhould to Chriſt.
               
                  
                     Queſt. 
                     See §. 5. of this Treatiſe. What if an husband be an enemie of Chriſt? muſt ſuch ſubiection be yeelded to an enemie of Chriſt as to Chriſt himſelfe?
                  
                     Anſw. Yea: becauſe in his office he is in Chriſts ſtead, though in his heart an enemie. In this caſe will the wiſdome, patience, and obedience of a wife be beſt tried. It is noted of the Church, that ſhe is a Lilly among thornes. She remaineth 
                        Cant. 2. 2. Lilly-like, white, ſoft, pleaſant, amiable, though ſhe be ioyned with thornes, which are ſcraggie, prickly, ſharpe: ſo a wife muſt be milde, meeke, gentle, obedient, though ſhe be matched with a crooked, peruerſe, profane, wicked husband: thus ſhall her vertue and grace ſhine forth the more clearely, euen as the ſtars ſhine forth moſt brightly in the darkeſt night. Among wiues Abigail deſerueth great praiſe, that forgot not her dutie, though ſhe were maried to a churliſh, couetous, drunken ſot, a verie Nabal in name and deed. As for thoſe who take occaſion from the wickedneſſe of their husbands to neglect their dutie, they adde to their croſſe a curſe: for a croſſe it is to haue a bad husband, but to be a bad wife is a ſinne, which pulleth downe a curſe. Let wiues therefore remoue their eyes from the diſpoſition of their husbands perſon, to the condition of his place: and by vertue thereof, ſeeing he beareth Chriſts image, be ſubiect to him as vnto Chriſt.
                  
                  This generall concluſion might be applied to the matter of

ſubiection as well as to the manner, for the Church acknowledgeth Chriſt her ſuperiour, feareth him inwardly, reuerenceth him outwardly, obeyeth him alſo both by forbearing to doe what he forbiddeth, and alſo by doing what he commandeth, which points hauing beene before diſtinctly and largely handled and applied to wiues, I will not repeat them againe. Wherefore now to inſiſt in the manner only, there are foure Foure graces needfull to ſeaſon a wiues ſubiection. vertues which are eſpecially needfull hereunto, whereby the Church ſeaſoneth her ſubiection to Chriſt, and wiues alſo may and muſt ſeaſon their ſubiection to their husbands.
                  Theſe are the foure,
                  1. Humilitie, 2. Sinceritie, 3. Cheerefulneſſe, 4. Conſtancie.

                  Treat 4. §. 15. 
                  humilitie in euery duty.
               
               Humility is that grace that keepes one from thinking highly of himſelfe aboue that which is meet: and in regard of that meane conceit which he hath of himſelfe maketh him thinke reuerendly, and highly of others: ſo as if humility be placed in a wiues heart, it will make her thinke better of her husband then of her ſelfe, and ſo make her the more willing to yeeld all ſubiection vnto him. The Apoſtle requireth it of all 
                     Phil. 2. 3. Epheſ. 4. 2. Chriſtians as a generall ſawce to ſeaſon all other duties: but after a peculiar maner is it needfull for inferiours: moſt of all for wiues, becauſe there are See before §. 4. many prerogatiues appertaining to their place, which may ſoone make them thinke they ought not to be ſubiect, vnleſſe they be humbly minded. That the Church doth herewith ſeaſon her ſubiection, is cleare by the booke of Canticles, where oft ſhe acknowledgeth her owne meanneſſe, and the excellency of her ſpouſe.
               
                  Therefore as the Church is humbly ſubiect to Chriſt, ſo let wiues be to their husbands.
               
            
            
               §. 56. Of wiues pride.
               
               Contrary is pride, which puffeth vp wiues, & maketh them thinke there is no reaſon they ſhould be ſubiect to husbands, they can rule themſelues well enough, yea and rule their huſbands too, as well as their husbands rule them. No more peſtilent vice for an inferiour, then this: it is the cauſe of all rebellion, diſobedience, & diſloyalty: only by pride, commeth contention.

                  ſinceritie in euery dutie.
               
               II. Sincerity is that grace that maketh one to be within euen in truth, what without he appeareth to be in ſhew. This is that 
                     Epheſ. 6. 5. 
                  Singleneſſe of heart which is expreſly required of ſeruants, and may be applied to wiues, for indeed it appertaineth to all ſorts. Becauſe it is only diſcerned by the Lord, who is the 
                     Acts 1. 24. 
                  ſearcher of all hearts, it will moue a wife to haue an eye to him in all ſhe doth, and to endeuour to approue her ſelfe to him aboue all: therefore vprightneſſe and walking before God are oft ioyned together: he that is vpright will aſſuredly walke before God, that is, endeuour to approue himſelfe to God, as 
                     Gen. 6. 9. 
                  Noah did, and as & 17. 1. God commanded Abraham to doe.
               Though there were no other motiue in the world to moue her to ſubiection, yet for conſcience ſake to Chriſt ſhe ſhould yeeld it. 1 Pet. 3. 5. 
                  S. Peter teſtifieth of holy women, that they truſted in God and were ſubiect to their husbands: implying thereby, that their conſcience to God made them be ſubiect to their huſbands. Was not Sarahs ſubiection ſeaſoned with ſinceritie, when 
                     Gen. 18. 12. 
                  within her ſelfe, in her heart ſhe called her husband Lord?
               
               Great reaſon there is that wiues ſhould in ſincerity ſubiect Reaſons for ſincerity. themſelues: for
               1. In their ſubiection euen to their husbands they haue to 1 Becauſe wiues haue to doe with Chriſt. doe with Chriſt, in whoſe roome their husbands ſtand: ſo as, though their husbands who are but men, ſee only the face and outward behauiour, yet Chriſt ſeeth their heart and inward diſpoſition: though their husbands ſee only the things which they doe before their faces, and can heare only of ſuch things as are done before others: yet Chriſt ſeeth and knoweth the things that are done in the moſt ſecret places that can be, when no creature beſide themſelues is priuie thereunto: Now let it be granted that in their outward carriage they giue very good contentment vnto their husbands, and pleaſe them euery way, yet if ſinceritie haue beene wanting, with what face can they appeare before Chriſt? he will take another manner account of them: before Chriſt all their outward complement will ſtand them in no ſtead at all.
               
                  
2. Herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt true, Chriſtian, 2. This maketh a difference betwixt holy women and others, religious wiues, and meere naturall women: theſe may be ſubiect on by-reſpects, as namely, that their husbands may the more loue them, or liue the more quietly and peaceably with them, or that they may the more readily obtaine what they deſire at their husbands hands, or for feare of their husbands diſpleaſure and wrath, knowing him to be an angry, furious man, ſo as otherwiſe it might be worſe with them, they might want many needfull things, or carry away many ſore blowes if they were not ſubiect. But the other haue reſpect to Chriſts ordinance, whereby their husbands are made their head, and to his word and will, whereby they are commanded ſubiection. Thus 1 Pet. 3. 5. holy women ſubiected themſelues; they cannot be holy that doe not thus ſubiect themſelues: for this is a ſweet perfume that ſendeth forth a good ſauour into Chriſts noſtrils, and maketh the things we doe pleaſant and acceptable to him.
               3. The benefit of this vertue being planted in a wiues heart 3. Great is the benefit hereof. is very great, and that both to her husband, and alſo to her ſelfe.
               To her husband, in that it will make her manifeſt her reſpect of him before others, behinde his backe, as well as before himſelfe in his preſence: and alſo will make her faithfull to him, and carefull to doe his will whereſoeuer he be, with her, or from her.
               To her ſelfe, in that it will miniſter inward ſweet comfort vnto her, though her husband ſhould take no notice of her ſubiection, or mif-interpret it, or ill requite it; for ſhe might ſay as Hezekiah did, 
                     Iſa. 38. 3. 
                  Remember ô Lord how I haue walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and haue done that which is good in thy ſight.
               
               That the Church doth ſeaſon all her ſubiection with ſinceritie is cleare, in that ſhe is ſaid to be 
                     Pſal. 45. 13. 
                  all glorious within: (there is no glory within, without ſinceritie) and in that ſhe is oft ſaid 
                     Cant. 3. 1, 2. 
                  to ſeeke him whom her ſoule loued: if her ſoule loued him, in ſinceritie of heart ſhe was ſubiect to him: Therefore as the Church is ſincerely ſubiect to Chriſt, ſo let wiues be to their huſbands.
               
            
            
               
               §. 58. Of wiues complementall ſubiection.
               
               Contrary to ſinceritie is diſſimulation, and meere outward, complementall ſubiection: when a wife doth euen deſpiſe her husband in her heart, as Michal did Dauid and yet carry a faire 2 Sam. 6. 16. Pro. 30. 20. face before him, as that adulterous woman, who eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and ſaith I haue not committed iniquitie. Salomon maketh it a note of a lewd wife to flatter with her words. 
                  
                     Pro. 2. 16. Though ſuch a wife ſhould performe all the duties named before, yet would thoſe all be nothing to God, if they were done with a double heart, and not in ſingleneſſe of heart. For as many outward imperfections are pardoned by God, where ſinceritie is, ſo no outward actions are accepted of him though they ſeeme neuer ſo faire, where there is no ſinceritie.
            
            
               §. 59. Of wiues 
                  Treat. 4. §. 65, 74. 
                  cheerefulneſſe in euery dutie.
               
               III. Cheerefulneſſe is more apparant then ſinceritie, and maketh ſubiection the more pleaſing not only to God, but alſo to man, who by the effects thereof may eaſily diſcerne it.
               
                  For God, as he doth himſelfe all things willingly and cheerefully, ſo he expecteth that his children ſhould therein follow him, and thereby ſhew themſelues his children. God loueth a 
                  2 Cor. 9. 7. 
                  cheerefull giuer: not only a cheerefull giuer of almes, but of all dutie to God and man.
               
                  For men, it maketh them alſo much better accept any dutie when they obſerue it to be done cheerefully: this did euen rauiſh Dauid with ioy, to ſee his people offer their gifts willingly 
                  1 Chro. 29. 9. vnto the Lord: when an husband ſeeth his wife willingly and cheerefully performe her dutie, it cannot but raiſe vp loue in him. This cheerefulneſſe is manifeſted by a ready, quicke, and ſpeedy performance of her duty. Sarahs readineſſe to obey, 
                     Gen. 18. ſheweth that what ſhe did, ſhe did willingly.
               That thus the Church ſubiecteth her ſelfe to Chriſt is euident by that which Dauid ſaith, They ſhall be willing in the day 
                  
                     Pſal. 110. 3. 
                  of thy power. Therefore as the Church is cheerefully ſubiect vnto Chriſt, ſo let wiues be to their husbands.
               
            
            
               §. 60. Of wiues ſullen and forced obedience.
               
               Contrary to this cheerefulneſſe is the ſullen diſpoſition of ſome wiues, who will indeed be ſubiect to their husbands, and obey, but with ſuch a lowring and ſowre countenance,

with ſuch powting and muttering, as they grieue their huſbands more in the manner, then they can be pleaſed with the thing it ſelfe that they doe: herein they ſhew themſelues like to a curſt cow, which hauing giuen a faire ſoape of milke, caſteth all downe with her heele, and ſo verifie the prouerbe, A good neuer a whit as neuer the better. Such ſubiection is in truth no ſubiection, it can neither be acceptable to God, nor profitable to their husbands, nor comfortable to their owne ſoules.
            
            
               §. 61. Of wiues 
                  Treat. 4. §. 72. 
                  conſtancy in doing their dutie.
               
               IIII. Conſtancy is a vertue which maketh all the reſt perfect, and ſetteth the crowne vpon them; without which they are all nothing. This is in thoſe who after they haue begun well, continue to doe well vnto the end, and thereby reape the fruit of all. It hath reſpect both to continuance without intermiſſion, and alſo to perſeuerance without reuolting, and giuing cleane ouer. So as it is not enough to be ſubiect by ſtarts and fits: one while yeelding all good obedience, another while ſtout and rebellious: neither is it ſufficient in former times to haue beene a good wife, and after proue bad: but there muſt be daily proceeding and holding on from time to time, ſo long as husband and wife liue together. This grace was in her of whom it is ſaid, She will doe him good, and not euill all the daies of her life. Such were all the holy wiues commended in Scripture: among other particulars, mention is made of the wife of Phinehas, who on her death-bed ſhewed the reuerend 1 Sam. 4. 21. good reſpect ſhe bare to her husband, though he were a wicked and lewd man. This grace doth the Church adde to all her other vertues, ſhe in all parts of her ſubiection remaineth conſtant, & faithfull vnto the death, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that at length ſhe receiueth the reward of her holy obedience, which is full and perfect communion and fellowſhip with her ſpouſe Chriſt Ieſus in heauen. In regard of her vnmoueable conſtancy it is ſaid, that the gates of hell ſhall neuer preuaile againſt 
                  
                     Matth. 16. 18. 
                  her. Therefore as the Church is conſtantly ſubiect vnto Chriſt, ſo let wiues be to their husbands.
               
            
            
               §. 62. Of wiues repenting their former goodneſſe. 
                  Contrary, 1. Intermiſſion.
               
               Contrary to this Conſtancie is firſt intermiſſion of duty, a returning

to it, and a leauing it off by turnes: like one that is ſicke of an ague, ſometimes well, ſometimes ill, one while hot, another while cold. That ſometimes ceaſing taketh away all the vertue, grace and glory, from ſometimes doing. Beſides, it is twenty to one that through the corruption of nature, that diuerſitie and entercourſe of fits at length will ceaſe, and end in the worſe. It is very likely that Michal was ſuch an one: for one while ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe ſo full of reſpect to Dauid, as 1 Sam. 19. 11, &c.
                   for his ſake ſhe incurred the King her fathers diſpleaſure: another while in her heart ſhe deſpiſed him, and with her tongue 2 Sam. 6. 16, 20. taunted him.
               Contrary alſo to the forenamed Conſtancy is Apoſtaſie, 
                  2. Apoſtaſie. that is, a cleane relinquiſhing of the former good courſe, as if a wife repented her of her former good beginning. Such an one is ſhe that is ſaid to for ſake the guide of her youth, and forget the 
                  
                     Pro. 2. 17. 
                  couenant of her God. For ought we reade to the contrary, Iobs wife was ſuch an one. And ſuch are many who in their younger yeares, while their religious parents liued (as Ioaſh while 2 Chron. 24. 2. old good Iehoiada liued) haue behaued themſelues very well like good dutifull wiues, but being grown to elder yeeres, haue growne alſo ſo ſtout and rebellious, as if they cleane repented themſelues of their former good beginning. This reuolt ariſeth ſometimes from the euill counſell of wicked Goſſips, and ſometimes from their owne proud humour. I may ſay of theſe wiues ſubiection, as the Prophet ſaith of the righteouſneſſe of reuolters, 
                     Ezek. 18. 24. 
                  their ſubiection ſhall not be remembred, but in their rebellion they ſhall die. Therefore as the Church is ſubiect to Chriſt, let wiues be to their husbands.

                  extent of a wiues obedience.
               
               The extent of a wiues ſubiection (which remaineth now to be handled) is ſet downe vnder theſe generall termes (in euery thing) which are not ſo generally to be taken as if they admitted no reſtraint or limitation, for then would they contradict ſuch cautions as theſe, in the feare of the Lord, as to the Lord, in 
                  
                     Eph. 5. 21. & 22. Col. 3. 18. 
                  the Lord. For man is ſo corrupt by nature, and of ſo peruerſe a diſpoſition, that oft he willeth and commandeth that which is contrary to Gods will and commandement: which when he

doth, that Chriſtian principle laid downe as a ruled caſe by the Apoſtle muſt take place, we ought rather to obey God then men. 
                  
                     Acts 5. 29.
               
               
                  Queſt. Why then is this extent laid downe in ſuch generall termes?
                  Anſw. 1. To teach wiues that it is not ſufficient for them to obey their husbands in ſome things, as they themſelues thinke meet, but in all things whatſoeuer they be wherein the husband by vertue of his ſuperioritie and authoritie hath power to command his wife. Thus this generall extent excludeth not Gods will, but the wiues will. Shee may doe nothing againſt Gods will; but many things muſt ſhe doe againſt her owne will if her husband require her.
                  2. To ſhew that the husbands authoritie and power is very large: it hath no reſtraint but Gods contrary command, whereof if a wife be not aſſured, ſhe muſt yeeld to her husbands will.
               
            
            
               §. 64. Of a wiues 
                  Treat. 4. §. 28, 29. 
                  labouring to bring her iudgement to the bent of her husbands.
               
               From that extent I gather theſe two concluſions:
               1. A wife muſt labour to bring her iudgement and will to her husbands.
               
               2. Though in her iudgement ſhe cannot thinke that moſt meet which her husband requireth, yet ſhe muſt yeeld to it in practiſe.
               
               In the former of theſe, I ſay not ſimply that a wife is bound to bring her iudgement to the bent of her husbands; for he may be deceiued in his iudgement, and ſhe may ſee his error, and then vnleſſe her vnderſtanding ſhould be blinded, ſhe cannot conceiue that to be true which he iudgeth ſo: but I ſpeake of endeuour (when ſhe hath not ſure and vndeniable grounds to the contrary) to ſuſpect her iudgement when its contrary to her husbands, and to thinke ſhe may be in an error, and thereupon not be too peremptory and reſolute in contradicting her husbands opinion. This ſubmiſſion euen of her iudgement reſpecteth not only things neceſſarie, for which her husband hath an expreſſe determinate warrant out of the Scripture, but alſo things doubtfull & indifferent: for euen ſo farre doth this clauſe (in euery thing) extend: and the ſubiection of a wife reſpecteth not her practiſe only, but her iudgement and opinion alſo: which if ſhe can bring to the lawfulneſſe and meetneſſe of that which her husband requireth,

ſhe will much more cheerefully performe it. To this purpoſe (as I take it) may be applied that exhortation of the Apoſtle vnto women, that they learne in ſilence with all ſubiection: 
                  1 Tim. 2. 11. which though it be principally meant of learning in the Church, yet it excludeth not her learning at home of her husband: for in the next words he addeth, I ſuffer not a woman to vſurpe authoritie ouer the man, but to be in ſilence.

               Contrary is the preſumption of ſuch wiues as thinke themſelues wifer then their husbands, and able better to iudge matters then they can. I denie not but that a wife may haue more vnderſtanding then her husband: for ſome men are very ignorant and blockiſh; and on the other ſide, ſome women well inſtructed, who thereby haue attained to a great meaſure of knowledge, and diſcretion; but many though they haue husbands of ſufficient and good vnderſtanding, wife and diſcreet men, yet thinke that that which they haue once conceiued to be a truth, muſt needs be ſo: and ſuch is their peremptorineſſe, that they wil not be brought to thinke that they may erre: but ſay they will neuer be brought to thinke otherwiſe then they doe, though all the husbands in the world ſhould be of another opinion: not much vnlike to the Wiſemans foole, who thinketh himſelfe wiſer then ſeuen men

                     . Naz. ad Olymp. hath reſpect to indifferent things, namely, to ſuch as are neither in their particulars commanded, nor forbidden by God: as the outward affaires of the houſe, ordering it, diſpoſing goods, entertaining gueſts, &c.
               
                  
                     Queſt. May ſhe not reaſon with her husband about ſuch matters as ſhe thinketh vnmeet, and labour to perſwade her husband not to perſiſt in the preſſing thereof, yea endeuour to bring her husband to ſee the vnmeetneſſe (as ſhe thinketh) of that which ſhe ſeeth?
                  
                     Anſw. With modeſty, humilitie, and reuerence, ſhe may ſo

doe: and he ought to hearken vnto her, as the husband of the Shunemite did, 2. King. 4. 23, 24. but yet, if notwithſtanding all that ſhe can ſay, he perſiſt in his reſolution, and will haue it done, ſhe muſt yeeld.
                  Firſt, her ſubiection is moſt manifeſted in ſuch caſes: herein ſhe apparantly ſheweth, that what ſhe doth, ſhe doth in reſpect of her husbands place, and power: were it not for that, ſhe would not doe it. Other things are not ſo euident proofes of her ſubiection to her husband: for if he command her to doe that which God hath expreſly commanded, and ſo ſhe ought to doe it, whether her husband commanded it or no, it may be thought ſhe doth it on Gods command, and not on her husbands. If her husband command her to doe that which God hath expreſly forbidden, then ought ſhe by no meanes to yeeld vnto it: if ſhe doe, it may rather be termed a ioint conſpiracie of husband and wife together againſt Gods will (as S. Peter ſaid to Sapphira the wife of Ananias, How is it that ye haue agreed together to tempt the 
                     
                        Acts 5. 9. 
                     ſpirit of the Lord?) then ſubiection to the image of God in her husband.
                  Secondly, her yeelding in indifferent things tendeth much to the peace of the family, as ſubiects yeelding to their Magiſtrates in ſuch caſes maketh much to the peace of the Common wealth. For in differencies and diſſentions one ſide muſt yeeld, or elſe great miſchiefe is like to follow: now of the two, who ſhould yeeld but the inferiour?
               
            
            
               §. 67. Of wiues making their owne will their law.
               
               Contrary is the cuſtome of many wiues, who neuer will doe any more then they themſelues thinke meet, though their huſbands require it neuer ſo much: ſurely they come farre ſhort of this Apoſtolicall extent (in euery thing) though in their own eies they may ſeeme to be very much ſubiect. But when wiues will no further be ſubiect, then their owne iudgments, wils and affections concurre with their husbands, what can be thought but that they are ſubiect rather to their owne wils, then to the will of their husbands? Many ſuch wiues, from the leaſt difference in iudgement & opiniō, euen in the ſmalleſt matters, take occaſion to refuſe ſubiection, and thinke they haue warrant enough ſo to doe: whence oftentimes there ariſeth much contention, the fault whereof lieth

eſpecially on the wiues necke, though the occaſion may ariſe from the husband: and I thinke that wiues themſelues would ſo iudge of the like caſes betwixt them and their children.

                     Obiect. If the caſe be ſuch betwixt man and wife, it is not good to marry.
                  
                     Anſw. This is no good inference; for all the ſeeming hardneſſe of a wiues caſe is in the lewdneſſe of an husband, who abuſeth his place and power: and not in that ſubiection which is required by God. For if an husband carry himſelfe to his wife as Tutū obſequium eſt, quoties qui dux eſt, ipſe Dei Spiritu ducitur. God requireth, ſhe will finde her yoke to be eaſie, and her ſubiection a great benefit euen vnto her ſelfe. Wherefore I would exhort parties that are vnmaried, whether maidens or widowes, to be very carefull in their choiſe of husbands: and in their choiſe to reſpect aboue all, their good qualities and conditions, therein bearing the image of Chriſt, as well as in their office, and authoritie: ſo as their wiues may with ioy and comfort, not with griefe and anguiſh, be ſubiect vnto them: then will ſubiection proue a vexation, when the husband is an ignorant, profane, idolatrous, worldly, wicked man: wiues of ſuch husbands are oft brought into many ſtraits. Ye widowes and maidens who are free, be not too free and forward in giuing your conſent to whom you know not: among other motiues, oft thinke of this point of ſubiection, to which all wiues are bound: this I ſay, both of the ſeuerall branches, and alſo of the extent thereof. After you are maried it is in vaine to thinke of freedome from ſubiection. By taking husbands, and giuing your ſelues to be wiues, you binde your ſelues to the law of the man, as long as he liueth. Then as you deſire to be accepted of God, and to finde mercy and comfort from him, you muſt beare this yoke, how heauy and grieuous ſoeuer it ſeeme to be.

                  Verſ. 24. Wherefore as the Church is ſubiect, &c.
               
               THe maine ground of all the reaſons which the Apoſtle here intimateth, is taken from the place wherin God hath ſet an husband, which is firſt by conſequence implied in theſe words, as to the Lord: and then more plainly and directly expreſſed in theſe, the husband is the head of the wife. The particle prefixed before theſe words (for) being a cauſall coniunction, doth ſhew, that they are here ſet downe as a reaſon, which is firſt propounded vnder a metaphor (head) and then amplified by that reſemblance which an husband hath therein vnto Chriſt (euen as Chriſt, &c.) which reſemblance is further commended by the vertue and benefit that proceedeth from the head-ſhip of Chriſt properly, and of an husband alſo by conſequence, in theſe words (and is the Sauiour of the bodie.) Vpon an husbands reſemblance vnto Chriſt, he inferreth that a wife ſhould haue a reſemblance vnto the Church, and ſo concludeth, Therefore as the Church is in ſubiection to Chriſt, ſo let wiues be to their husbands.
               
               Out of the forenamed ground of a wiues ſubiection, and the ſeuerall amplifications thereof, and the inference thereupon made, fiue ſeuerall and diſtinct reaſons may be gathered to enforce a wines ſubiection to her husband.
               The firſt is taken from an husbands place: he is in the Lords ſtead to his wife (as to the Lord.)
               
               The ſecond from his office: he is an head to his wife.
               The chird from the image he beareth, or from the reſemblance betwixt him and Chriſt (euen as Chriſt &c.)
               
               
                  
The fourth from the benefit that his wife receiueth from him (he is the Sauiour &c.)
               
               The fift from the example and patterne of the Church (as the Church is in ſubiection, &c.)
               
            
            
               § 70. Of an husbands place.
               
               The place wherein God hath ſet an husband as it ſerueth 1. Reaſon.
                   to direct a wife in the manner of her ſubiection, whereof I haue ſpoken §. 51. before, ſo alſo it ſerueth to moue a wife to yeeld ſuch ſubiection as is required: which will euidently appeare by theſe two concluſions following from thence.
               1. A wife by ſubiecting her ſelfe to her husband, therein is ſubiect vnto Chriſt.
               
               2. A wife by refuſing to be ſubiect vnto her husband, therein refuſeth to be ſubiect vnto Chriſt.
               
               That theſe two concluſions are rightly and iuſtly gathered from the forenamed ground I proue by like concluſions which the holy Ghoſt inferreth vpon the like ground. It is euident that Chriſt Ieſus, euen incarnat and made fleſh, was in the roome and ſtead of his father, whereupon Chriſt ſaid to Philip that deſired to ſee the father, he that hath ſeene me hath ſeene the father: Now marke what Chriſt thence inferreth both on 
                     Ioh. 14. 9. Mat. 10. 40. Ioh. 5. 23. the one ſide (he that receiueth me receiueth him that ſent me) and on the other (he that honoureth not the ſonne, honoureth not the father that ſent him.) It is alſo euident that Miniſters of the Goſpell ſtand in the roome and ſtead of Chriſt: for thus ſaith the Apoſtle of himſelfe and other Miniſters, we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by vs, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, &c. Now marke againe the concluſions inferred thereupon by Chriſt, on the one ſide, he that heareth 
                  
                     Luk. 10. 16. 
                  you, heareth me, and on the other, he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me. On this ground it was that God ſaid to Samuel concerning the people that reiected his gouernment, they haue not caſt thee away, but they haue caſt me away. 
                  1 Sam. 8. 7.
               
               To apply this reaſon, I hope ſuch wiues as liue vnder the Goſpell haue ſo much religion and piety in them as to acknowledge, it becommeth them well to be ſubiect vnto the Lord Chriſt Ieſus: here then learne one eſpeciall and principall part of ſubiection vnto Chriſt, which is to be ſubiect

vnto your husbands: thus ſhall you ſhew your ſelues to be the wiues of the Lord Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith of obedient ſeruants, they are the ſeruants of God. 
                  1 Pet. 2. 16.
               
               Againe I hope none are ſo void of all religion and piety as to refuſe to be ſubiect vnto Chriſt: here then take notice, that if wilfully yee refuſe to be ſubiect to your husbands, yee wilfully refuſe to be ſubiect to Chriſt: fitly on this ground may I apply that to wiues, which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſubiects, whoſoeuer reſiſteth the power and authority of an husband, 
                  
                     Rom. 13. 2. 
                  reſiſteth the ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt ſhall receiue to themſelues iudgement.
               
               A ſtrong motiue is this firſt motiue. If it were duly conſidered of wiues, they would more readily, and cheerefully be ſubiect, then many are; they would not ſo lightly thinke of their husbands place, nor ſo reproachfully ſpeake againſt Gods Miniſters who plainly declare their duty vnto them, as many doe.
            
            
               §. 71. Of an husbands office.
               
               The ſecond reaſon is like vnto this taken from an husbands 2. Reaſon. 1 Cor. 11. 3. office, he is the wiues head: which is alſo vrged to this very purpoſe in other places.
               This metaphor ſheweth that to his wife he is as the head of a naturall body, both more eminent in place, and alſo more excellent in dignity: by vertue of both which, he is a ruler and gouernour of his wife. Nature teacheth vs that this is true of the head of a naturall body: and the Apoſtle by intituling an husband, an head, teacheth vs that it is as true of an husband: whence it followeth, that it ſtandeth with common equity, and with the light of nature, that the wife ſhould be ſubiect to her husband. This argument doth the Apoſtle in plaine termes vrge in another place, ſaying, doth not nature teach you, &c. 
                  1 Cor. 11. 14.
               
               Goe therefore, ô wiues, vnto the ſchoole of nature, looke vpon the outward parts and members of your bodies. Doe they deſire to be aboue the head? are they loth to be ſubiect vnto the head? Let your ſoule then learne of your body. Were it not monſtrous for the ſide to be aduanced aboue the head? If the body ſhould not be ſubiect to the head, would not deſtruction

follow vpon head, body, and all the parts thereof? As monſtrous, and much more monſtrous is it for a wife to be aboue her husband: and as great, yea and greater diſturbance and ruine would fall on that family. The order which God hath ſet therein would be cleane ouerthrowne thereby: and they that ouerthrow it would ſhew themſelues oppugners of Gods wiſdome in eſtabliſhing order. This reaſon drawne from nature is of force to moue very Pagans, and Sauages to yeeld ſubiection, how much more Chriſtian wiues, it being alſo agreeable to Gods word, and ratified thereby?
            
            
               §. 72. Of the reſemblance betwixt Chriſt and an husband.
               
               The third reaſon taken from an husbands reſemblance vnto 3. Reaſon.
                   Chriſt herein, addeth an edge vnto that former reaſon: in being an head, he is like Chriſt. So as there is a kinde of fellowſhip and copartnerſhip betwixt Chriſt, and an husband: they are brethren in office, as two kings of ſeuerall places.
               
                  Obiect. There is no equality betwixt Chriſt the Lord from heauen, and an earthly husband: the diſparity betwixt them is infinite.
               
                  Anſw. Yet there may be ſimilitude, reſemblance, and fellowſhip: inequality is no hinderance to theſe. Two kings may be more different in eſtate then a ſubiect and a king; yet thoſe two kings brethren and fellowes in office. There may be a reſemblance where there is no parity, and a likeneſſe where there is no equality. The glorious and bright Sunne in the firmament, and a dimme candle in an houſe, haue a kinde of fellowſhip, and the ſame office, which is to giue light: yet there is no equality betwixt them. So then an husband reſembleth not only the head of a naturall body, but alſo the glorious image of Chriſt, and is that to his wife which Chriſt is to his Church.
               To apply this point, marke how from it two poſitions (worthy to be noted) doe ariſe.
               1. Subiection is due to an husband as well as to Chriſt. 
                  Subiection due to an husband as well as to Chriſt.
               
               I ſay not as great, becauſe of the difference in glory: but as well, becauſe of the likeneſſe in office. A Conſtable (though a poore meane man) muſt be obeyed as well as an high ſherife: A beggars childe muſt obey his father, as well as a kings

childe. Such wiues therefore who are not ſubiect, wrong their husbands, as well as they wrong Chriſt who are not ſubiect to him.
               2. They who by their ſubiection maintaine the honour of their husbands place, maintaine thereby the honour of Chriſts place: and againe by the rule of contraries, They who by refuſing to be ſubiect impeach the honour of their husbands place, impeach thereby the honour of Chriſts place.
               
               The obedience of a poore mans childe or ſeruant iuſtifieth that obedience which kings children and ſeruants owe their father and ſoueraigne: and ſo on the contrary, diſobedience in meane ones, diſhonoureth the place of great ones.
               The argument of Memucan drawne from the greater to the 
                     Eſt. 1. 16. leſſe (in theſe words, Vaſhty the Queene hath not done wrong to the king only, but alſo to all the princes, and all the people) may be applied from the leſſe to the greater. Diſobedient wiues doe wrong not only to their owne particular husbands, but alſo to all heads, euen to Chriſt the head of the Church.
               If a naturall body, and the Church were flexible, and could be ſeduced, and drawne to preſume, and rebell againſt their heads, the ill example of wiues were enough to moue them thereunto, for, as much as in them lieth, they by example ſeduce them.
               From the laſt forenamed poſitions (viz. that the obedience of a good wife maintaineth the honour of Chriſts place, and on the contrary ſide that the diſobedience of an ill wife impaireth the honour thereof) I may iuſtly inferre two other concluſions.
               1. That Chriſt will aſſuredly reward the good ſubiection of 
                  Chriſt will reward the good ſubiection, and reuenge the rebellion of wiues. 
                  good wiues: for he hath ſaid (and what he hath ſaid he can and will performe) them that honour me will I honour.
               
               2. That he will ſorely reuenge the rebellion of euill wiues: for againe he hath ſaid, they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be deſpiſed.
               
               We know that fellowes in office are ready to ſtand for the 1 Sam. 2. 30. credit of one anothers place, and to maintaine the honour thereof: and that not without good reaſon: for thereby they maintaine their owne honour and credit.
               Wherefore as good wiues may well expect a reward at Chriſts hands, howſoeuer their husbands reſpect their obedience,

whether well or ill: (a great incouragement for wiues to performe their duties, though their husbands be neuer ſo ill) ſo euill wiues haue iuſt cauſe to feare reuenge at Chriſts hand, how ſoeuer their husbands beare with them.
               They who duly weigh this reaſon taken from that reſemblance which is betwixt Chriſt and the Church, cannot but hold it to be a motiue of great moment.
            
            
               §. 73. Of the benefit which a wife hath by an husband.
               
               The fourth reaſon taken from the benefit which a wife receiueth 4. Reaſon.
                   from her husband, doth yet further preſſe the point in hand. Though Chriſt be properly the Sauiour of the bodie, yet euen herein an husband carieth a reſemblance of Chriſt, and is after a manner a Saniour: for by vertue of his place and office he is on the one ſide her protector, to defend her from hurt, and preſerue her from danger; and on the other ſide, a pronider of all needfull and neceſſarie things for her: in which reſpect ſhe is taken from her parents and friends, and wholly committed 
                     Gen. 31. 14. to him: (as Iaakobs wiues ſaid, Haue we any more portion or inheritance in our fathers houſe?) yea ſhe her ſelfe, and all ſhe hath is giuen to him: and he againe communicateth what ſoeuer he hath to her good, and for her vſe. Dauid compareth a wife to 
                     Pſal. 128. 3. a Vine, in relation to her husband: intimating thereby, that by him ſhe is raiſed to that height of honour ſhe hath, as a vine by the tree, or frame neere vnto which it is planted. By his honour is ſhe dignified, by his wealth is ſhe enriched. He is, vnder God, all in all to her; in the family he is a King to gouerne and aid her, a Prieſt to pray with her and for her, a Prophet to teach and inſtruct her. As the head is placed in the higheſt place ouer the bodie, and vnderſtanding placed in it, to gouerne, direct, protect, and euerie way ſeeke the good of the bodie, and as Chriſt is vnited to the Church as a ſpouſe, and made her head, that ſhe might be ſaued, maintained, and prouided for by him; ſo for this end was an husband placed in his place of ſuperioritie; and his authoritie was committed to him, to be a Saniour of his wife. Wherefore if none of the former motiues preuaile with wiues, and moue them to be ſubiect to their husbands, yet ought this.
               For from this reaſon flow theſe two concluſions.

                     
                        
1. The ſubiection required of a wife is for her owne good.
                     
                     2. In refuſing to obey ſhe ſheweth her ſelfe both vngratefull to her husband, and alſo iniurious to her ſelfe.
                     
                  
               
               That her ſubiection is for her owne good, is euident by this A wiues ſubiection tendeth to her owne good. end for which an husband is made an head, to be a Saniour: not to puffe him vp, to make him inſult and tyrannize ouer his wife. So as if ſhe be ſubiect vnto him, ſhe may reape much good from him. As the Church is wiſely gouerned, and ſafely protected by ſubiecting her ſelfe to her head Chriſt Ieſus; and as the body partaketh of much good, and is preſerued from much euill by ſubiecting it ſelfe to the head, ſo if a wife be ſubiect to her huſband, ſhe will fare much the better thereby, all the eaſe, profit, and benefit thereof will be hers. If therefore ſhe tender her owne good, this is a way and meanes ordained of God for this end; let her herein ſeeke it.
               If notwithſtanding this ſhe refuſe to be ſubiect vnto her huſband, doth ſhe not (as we ſay) ſtand in her owne light? She being by her ſex the weaker, and the more vnable to helpe her ſelfe, 
                     •
                  f ſhe ſhall reiect this good helpe which God hath prouided for her, is ſhe not moſt iniurious to her owne ſelfe? And conſidering Gratitude requireth a wife to be ſubiect. the care and pains her husband vndergoeth for her ſake, is it not moſt vnnaturall and monſtrous ingratitude, inwardly to de

                  l vnder it, euen that whole ſociety of Saints, which are choſen

of God in his eternall counſell, redeemed of Chriſt by his precious bloud, and effectually called by the Goſpell of faluation, Gods ſpirit working inwardly and powerfully vpon them, thoſe very ſoules of iuſt and perfect men now triumphing in heauen, not excepted: note how this Church is deſcribed in the 26, and 27. verſes. Let this example therefore be oft thought of: it will neuer repent any to follow it: for it treadeth the only right path to eternall glory, whereunto they ſhall aſſuredly come that follow it.
               But to ſhew the force of this reaſon a little more diſtinctly, note theſe two concluſions following from it.
               1. Wiues are as much bound to be ſubiect to their husbands, as the Church to Chriſt. Elſe why ſhould this example be thus ſet before them, and preſſed vpon them? why are husbands ſet in Chriſts ſtead, and reſembled to him?
               2. A wiues ſubiection to her husband, anſwerable to the Churches ſubiection vnto Chriſt, is an euidence that ſhe is of the Church, guided by the ſame Spirit that the Church is. For it cannot be performed by the power of nature, it is a ſupernaturall worke, and ſo an euidence of the Spirit.
               Wherefore, ô Chriſtian wiues, as your husbands by their place reſemble Chriſt, ſo doe you by your practiſe reſemble the Church. Of the two this is the more commendable: for that is a dignitie, this a vertue: but true vertue is much more glorious then any dignitie can be.
               Theſe reaſons being well poiſed, and the force of them all ioyned together, they cannot but worke on the ſtouteſt ſtomacke that is: wherefore if this point of ſubiection ſeeme to be too bitter a pill to be well digeſted, let it be ſweetned with the ſyrupe of theſe reaſons, and it will much better be ſwallowed, and haue the more kindly worke.

               §. 1. Of the Generall Heads of this Treatiſe.
               
               
                  EPHES. 5. 25, &c.
                  Husbands loue your owne wiues, euen as Chriſt alſo loued the Church, &c.
               
               
                  AS the wife is to know her dutie, ſo the huſband Husbands bound to dutie. Propterea debent mulieribus ſuis ad virtutis exemplum ſe praebere, quia viri ſunt. Aug. de adult. Coniug. l. 2. c. 8. much more his, becauſe he is to be a guide, and good example to his wife, he is to dwell with her according to knowledge, (1 Pet. 3. 7.) the more eminent his place is, the more knowledge he ought to haue how to walke worthy thereof. Neglect of dutie in him is more diſhonourable vnto God, becauſe by vertue of his place he is 1 Cor. 11. 7. 
                  the Imag eand glory of God, and more pernicious not to his wife only, but alſo to the whole family, becauſe of that power and authority he hath, which he may abuſe to the maintenance of his wickedneſſe, hauing in the houſe no ſuperiour power to reſtraine his fury: whereas the wife, though neuer ſo wicked, may by the power of her husband be kept vnder, and reſtrained from outrage.
               Wherefore to goe on in order, in laying downe the husbands Husbands particular duties. duties (as we haue the wiues) we are to conſider,

                     1. The Duties themſelues.
                     2. The reaſons to inforce them.
                  
               
               In ſetting downe the duties we muſt note

                     1. The matter wherein they conſiſt.
                     
                        
2. The manner how they are to be performed.
                  
               
               The Apoſtle compriſeth the whole matter of them all vnder Loue, which is the ſumme and head of all.
               This we will firſt handle: and then proceed to other particulars.
            
            
               §. 2. Of that 
                  Treat. 3. §. 2. 1. Husbands muſt loue their wiues. 
                  loue which husbands owe their wiues.
               
               This head of all the reſt, Loue, is expreſly ſet downe, and alone mentioned in this, and in many other places of Scripture, whereby it is euident, that all other duties are compriſed vnder it.
               To omit other places, where this dutie is vrged in 
                     Eph. 5. 25, 28, 33. this place, Loue is foure times by name expreſſed, beſide that it is intimated vnder many other termes and phraſes.
               Whoſoeuer therefore taketh a wife, muſt, in this reſpect that ſhe is his wife, loue her: as it is noted of Iſaak (the beſt patterne of husbands noted in the Scripture) 
                     Gen. 24. 67. 
                  he tooke Rebekah, ſhe was his wife ana he loued her.
               
               Many good reaſons hereof may be rendred. No dutie well performed without loue.
               
               1. Becauſe no dutie on the husbands part can be rightly performed except it be ſeaſoned with loue. The Apoſtle exhorteth all Chriſtians to doe all their things in loue: much more 1 Cor. 16. 14. ought husbands: though in place they be aboue their wiues, yet loue may not be forgotten.
               2. Becauſe of all perſons on earth a wife is the moſt proper 2. A wife the moſt proper obiect of loue. Deut. 13. 6. obiect of loue: nor friend, nor childe, nor parent ought ſo to be loued as a wife: ſhe is termed, the wife of his boſome, to ſhew that ſhe ought to be as his heart in his boſome.
               3. Becauſe his place of eminency, and power of authority 3. Loue keepes a man from abuſing his authority. may ſoone puffe him vp, and make him inſult ouer his wife, and trample her vnder his feet, if a intire loue of her be not planted in his heart. To keepe him from abuſing his authority is loue ſo much preſſed vpon him.
               4. Becauſe wiues through the weakneſſe of their ſex (for 4. Loue maketh him beare with her infirmities. 5. His loue draweth loue from her. they are the weaker veſſels) are much prone to prouoke their husbands. So as if there be not loue predominant in the huſband, there is like to be but little peace betwixt man and wife. Loue couereth a multitude of imperfections.
               
               5. Becauſe as Chriſt by his loue firſt manifeſted prouoketh

the Church to loue him, ſo an husband by louing his wife ſhould prouoke her to loue him againe: ſhewing himſelfe like the Sunne which is the fountaine of light, and from which the Moone receiueth what light ſhe hath: ſo he ſhould be the fountaine of loue to his wife.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Loue was before laid downe as a common dutie appertaining both to man and wife: how is it then here required as a particular and peculiar dutie of an husband?
                  
                     Anſw. In regard of the generall extent of loue it is indeed a common dutie belonging to the one as well as to the other, yea How loue is an husbands particular dutie. 1 Cor. 13. 5. belonging to all Chriſtians, to all men: for it is the very nature of loue, and an eſpeciall property thereof, to ſeeke not her owne things, but the good of others, which all are bound to doe by vertue of the bond of nature; more then others, Chriſtians by vertue of the bond of the ſpirit: among Chriſtians, eſpecially wiues and husbands by vertue of the matrimoniall bond: of maried couples, moſt of all husbands by vertue of their place and charge. Their place is a place of authoritie, which without loue will ſoone turne into tyrannie. Their charge is eſpecially and aboue all, to ſeeke the good of their wiues: as wiues are the chiefeſt, and greateſt charge of husbands, ſo their chiefeſt and greateſt care muſt be for them: the parents and friends of wiues as they giue ouer all their authority to their husbands, ſo they caſt all care vpon them: wherefore that husbands may take the more care of their wiues, and the better ſeeke their good, they ought after a peculiar manner to loue them. Husbands are moſt of all bound to loue: and bound to loue their wiues moſt of all.
                  Thus this affection of loue is a diſtinct dutie in it ſelfe, peculiarly Loue a common condition to be annexed to euerie dutie. appertaining to an husband: and alſo a common condition which muſt be annexed to euery other dutie of an huſband, to ſeaſon and ſweeten the ſame. His looke, his ſpeech, his carriage, and all his actions, wherein he hath to doe with his wife, muſt be ſeaſoned with loue: loue muſt ſhew it ſelfe in his commandements, in his reproofes, in his inſtructions, in his admonitions, in his authoritie, in his familiaritie, when they are alone together, when they are in company before others, in ciuill affaires, in religious matters, at all times, in all

things: as ſalt muſt be firſt and laſt vpon the table, and eaten with euery bit of meate, ſo muſt loue be firſt in an husbands heart, and laſt out of it, and mixed with euery thing wherein he hath to doe with his wife.
               
            
            
               §. 3. Of an husbands hatred and want of loue.
               
               Contrary hereunto is hatred of heart: which vice as it is Contrary, 1. Hatred. very odious and deteſtable in it ſelfe, ſo much more when the wife is made the obiect thereof. As loue prouoketh an huſband to doe his wife what good he can, ſo hatred, to doe her what miſchiefe he can. Moſes noteth a mans hatred of his 
                     Deut. 22. 13, &c.
                   wife to be a cauſe of much miſchiefe: for the neerer, and dearer any perſons be, the more violent will that hatred be which is faſtened on them.
               Hence was it that a diuorce was ſuffered to be made betwixt 
                     Deut. 24. 3. a man and his wife, in caſe he hated her: which law queſtionleſſe was made for releefe of the wife, leſt the hatred which her husband conceiued againſt her ſhould worke her ſome miſchiefe, if he were forced to keepe her as his wife: which Chriſt ſeemeth to imply in theſe words, Moſes, becauſe of the 
                  
                     Mat. 19. 8. 
                  hardneſſe of your hearts, ſuffered you to put away your wines. This therefore being ſo peſtilent a poiſon, let husbands take heed how they ſuffer it to ſoake into them.
               Neither is it ſufficient for an husband not to hate his wife, 2. Want of loue. for euen the want of loue, though it be only a priuation, yet is it a great vice, and contrary alſo to the forenamed dutie of loue. Where this want of loue is, there can be no duty wel performed, euen as when the great wheele of a clocke, the firſt mouer of all the reſt, is out of frame, neuer a wheele can be in good order. They that thinke lightly hereof, plainly diſcouer that there is little or no loue of God in them at all: for if the Apoſtles inference be good, taken from a mans neighbour or brother whom 1 Ioh. 4. 20. he hath ſeene, it will much more be good hauing relation to a wife: for how can he who loueth not his wife, (whom God hath giuen to him as a token of his fauour, and as an helpe meet for him, to be in his boſome, and euer in his ſight, yea to be no more two, but one fleſh) loue God whom he hath not ſeene? If any man ſaith, he loueth God, and hate his wife, he is a lier. Let

husbands therefore by louing their wiues giue euidence that they loue God.
            
            
               §. 4. Of an husbands 
                  Treat. 3. §. 9. Branches of loue. 
                  wiſe maintaining his authoritie.
               
               All the branches which grow out of this root of loue, as they haue reſpect to husbands duties, may be drawne to two heads:

                     1. A wiſe maintaining of his authoritie.
                     
                     2. A right managing of the ſame.
                     
                  
               
               That theſe two are branches of an husbands loue, is euident by the place wherein God hath ſet him, which is a place of authoritie; for the beſt good that any can doe, and ſo the beſt fruits of loue which he can ſhew forth to any, are ſuch as are done in his owne proper place, and by vertue thereof. If then an husband relinquiſh his authoritie, he diſableth himſelfe from doing that good, and ſhewing thoſe fruits of loue which otherwiſe he might. If he abuſe his authoritie, he turneth the edge and point of his ſword amiſſe: in ſtead of holding it ouer his wife for her protection, he turneth it into her bowels to her deſtruction, and ſo manifeſteth thereby more hatred then loue.
               Now then to handle theſe two ſeuerally, and diſtinctly:
               I. That an husband ought wiſely to maintaine his authoritie, II. Husbands muſt maintaine their authoritie. is implied vnder this Apoſtolicall precept, Husbands dwell with your wiues according to knowledge, that is, as ſuch as are well able to maintaine the honour of that place wherein God 1 Pet. 3. 7. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . hath ſet you: not as ſots and fooles without vnderſtanding. The ſame is alſo implied vnder the titles of preheminence which the Scripture attributeth to husbands, as Lord, Maſter, 
                  See Treat. 3. §. 3. Reaſons. 
                  head, guide, image and glory of God, &c.
               
               The honour and authoritie of God, and of his Sonne Chriſt 1. Gods authoritie maintained by the husbands. Ieſus, is maintained in and by the honour and authoritie of an husband, as the Kings authoritie is maintained by the authoritie of his Priuy Councell and other Magiſtrates vnder him; yea, as an husbands authoritie is in the family maintained by the authoritie of his wife: (for as the man is the glory of God, ſo 
                  1 Cor. 11. 7. 
                  the woman is the glory of the man.)
               
               The good of the wife her ſelfe is thus alſo much promoted, 2. The wiues good promoted thereby. euen as the good of the body is helped forward by the heads

abiding in his place; ſhould the head be put vnder any of the parts of the body, the body and all the parts thereof could not but receiue much dammage thereby: euen ſo the wife and whole family would feele the dammage of the husbands loſſe of his authoritie.
               
                  1. Queſt. Is it in the power of the husband to maintaine his owne authoritie?
                  
                     Anſw. Yea, in his more then in any others: for note the It is in the mans power to maintaine his authoritie. 1 Tim. 4. 12. counſell of the Apoſtle to Timothie, (though in another caſe, yet very pertinent to this purpoſe) Let no man deſpiſe thy youth. It was therefore in Timothies power to maintaine his honour, and not to ſuffer it to be deſpiſed; and ſo is it in an husbands power.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. How may an husband beſt maintaine his authoritie?
                  
                     Anſw. That direction which the Apoſtle giueth to Timothie 
                     How a mans authority may be well maintained. Ad viros pertinet virtute vincere, & exemplo regere foemina
                              •
                           . Aug. de Adult. Coniug. lib. 2. cap. 8. to maintaine his authoritie, may fitly be applied for this purpoſe vnto an husband; Be an enſample in conuerſation, in loue, in ſpirit, in faith, and in pureneſſe: as if he had ſaid, If thou walke before them worthy of thy place and calling, and worthy of that honour and reſpect which is due thereunto, ſhewing forth the fruits of loue, faith, and other like graces, aſſuredly they will reuerence thy youth; but if otherwiſe thou carrie thy ſelfe baſely, and not beſeeming a miniſter, thou giueſt them iuſt occaſion to deſpiſe thee. Euen thus may husbands beſt maintaine their authoritie by being an enſample in loue, grauitie, pietie, honeſty, &c. The fruits of theſe and other like graces ſhewed forth by husbands before their wiues and family, cannot but worke a reuerend and dutifull reſpect in their wiues and whole houſe towards them: for by this means they ſhall more cleerely diſcerne the image of God ſhine forth in their faces.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Very goodneſſe and grace it ſelfe is hated of wicked and vngodly wiues: it was an act of pietie that made Michal deſpiſe Dauid.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. 1. Grant it to be ſo: yet this may be a good direction for ſuch husbands as haue not ſuch wicked wiues.
                  2. This doth not alwaies ſo fall our, no, nor yet for the moſt

part in thoſe that are wicked; true vertue and integritie doth oft cauſe admiration in ſuch as loue it not.
                  3. Though ſome be of ſo crooked and peruerſe a diſpoſition as to take occaſion of contempt, where none is giuen, yet ſhall that husband iuſtifie himſelfe before God and man, that carryeth himſelfe worthy of his place.
               
            
            
               §. 5. Of husbands loſing their authoritie.
               
               Contrary is their practiſe who by their profaneneſſe, riotouſneſſe, Contrary, 1. baſe carriage drunkenneſſe, lewdneſſe, lightneſſe, vnthriftineſſe, and other like baſe carriage, make themſelues contemptible, and ſo loſe their authoritie: though a wife ought not to take theſe occaſions to deſpiſe her husband, yet is it a iuſt iudgement on him to be deſpiſed, ſeeing he maketh himſelfe contemptible.
               Contrary alſo to the forenamed directions is the ſterne, 2. Cruell dealing. rough, and cruel carriage of husbands, who by violence and tyranny goe about to maintaine their authority. Force may indeed cauſe feare, but a ſlauiſh feate, ſuch a feare as breedeth more hatred then loue, more inward contempt, then outward reſpect.
               And contrary is their ſeruile diſpoſition, who againſt their 3. Yeelding in vnlawfull things. owne iudgement yeeld to the bent of their wiues minde in ſuch things as are vnlawfull: they will loſe their authority rather then giue diſcontent to their wiues: which is a fault expreſly forbidden by the

Like to Ahab are ſuch Magiſtrates as ſuffer their wiues to ouerſway them in courſe of Iuſtice: hence it commeth to paſſe that more petitions and ſuites are made to the wiues of Magiſtrates in the caſes of Iuſtice then to the Magiſtrates themſelues: and the fauour of their wiues is more eſteemed then their owne: ſo as the power of gouerning, and the maine ſtroke in determining matters, is from their wiues; they are but

the mouthes and inſtrument of their wiues, in ſo much as among the common people the title of their places and offices is giuen to their wiues. Some husbands ſuffer this by reaſon of their fearefull, and fooliſh diſpoſition, wanting courage and wiſdome to maintaine the honour of their places againſt the inſolency of their wiues: others vpon a ſubtil, couetous, wicked minde, that by the meanes of their wiues there may be more freedome for receiuing bribes. Among theſe I may reckon thoſe who againſt their owne minde, to ſatisfie their wiues minde, ſuffer both wiues and children to follow the faſhion, to attire themſelues vnbeſeeming their places, to frequent light company, with the like; and alſo thoſe who vpon their wiues importunitie are moued (as Sampſon was) to reueale ſuch ſecrets

Husbands may hearken to their wiues mouing good things, but they may not obey them in euill things: if they doe, their fault is double: 1. in doing euill: 2. in loſing their authoritie.
               Let husbands therefore be very watchfull againſt their wiues euill inſtigations. Satan laboured to ſupplant Iob by his wife: and by this doth he ſubuert many in theſe daies.

                  Treat 3. §. 3. How a mans authority may be well managed. 
                  high account of wiues.
               
               As authority muſt be well maintained, ſo muſt it be well managed: for which purpoſe two things are needfull:

                     1. That an husband tenderly reſpect his wife.
                     2. That prouidently he care for her.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        An husbands tender reſpect of his wife is
                        
                           Inward.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Outward.
                        
                         
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Inward in regard of his
                        
                           Opinion of her.
                     
                     
                        
                           Affection to her.
                         
                     
                  
               
               Outward in regard of his cariage towards her.
               
                  
                     
                        For an husbands opinion of his wife, two things are to be weighed,
                        Her place,
                        
                     
                     
                        Her perſon.
                        
                         
                     
                  
               
               1. Her place is indeed a place of inferiority, and ſubiection, yet the neereſt to equality that may be: a place of common Husbands muſt account their wiues yoke-fellowes. 1 Pet. 3. 7. equity in many reſpects, wherein man and wife are after a ſort euen fellowes, and partners: Hence then it followeth that
               
                  The husband muſt account his wife a yoke-fellow and companion. This is one point of giuing honour to the wife: and it is implied

vnder that phraſe wherby the end of making a wife is noted, 
                     Gen. 2. 18. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   which in our Engliſh is tranſlated, meet for him, word for word as before him that is, like himſelfe, one in whom he might 
                     Eph. 5. 28. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . ſee himſelfe, or euen (to vſe our Apoſtles word) himſelfe. Theſe phraſes imply a kinde of fellowſhip: as alſo the many prerogatiues that are common to both, which haue beene noted Treat. 3. §. 4. before.
               As a wiues acknowledgement of her husbands ſuperiority is the ground-worke of all her duties, ſo an husbands acknowledgement of that fellowſhip which is betwixt him and his wife, will make him carry himſelfe much more amiably, familiarly, louingly, and euery way as beſeemeth a good husband towards her.
            
            
               §. 7. Of that fellowſhip which is betwixt man and wife, notwithſtanding a wiues inferiority.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Fellowſhip betwixt man and wife cannot ſtand with a wiues inferiority and ſubiection.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. They are of very meane capacity that cannot ſee how theſe may ſtand together. Is there not a fellowſhip betwixt ſuperiour and inferiour magiſtrates in relation to their ſubiects? yea the Scripture mentioneth a fellowſhip betwixt Chriſt the head and other Saints in relation to the glory 
                        Rom. 8. 17. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . whereof all are made partakers (for it termeth vs ioynt heires with Chriſt:) and in relation to Gods people a fellowſhip betwixt God and his miniſters (for it termeth them labourers together 
                     1 Cor. 3. 9. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     with God) yet none can denie the Saints, and miniſters to be inferiour and in ſubiection to Chriſt, and God. But diſtinctly to anſwer the obiection.
                  1. There may not only be a fellowſhip, but alſo an equality in ſome things betwixt thoſe that in other things are one of them inferiour and ſubiect: as betwixt man and wife in the power of one another bodies: for the wife (as well as the huſband) 
                        Vxor & ſerua & domina eſt viri, Chryſoſt. in 1 Cor. 7. hom. 19. is therein both a ſeruant, and a miſtreſſe, a ſeruant to yeeld her body, a miſtreſſe to haue the power of his.
                  
                  2. There may be fellowſhip in the very ſame things wherein is inferiority: for fellowſhip hath reſpect to the thing it ſelfe, inferiority to the meaſure, and manner: as in giuing light the Sunne and Moone haue a fellowſhip, but in the meaſure and

manner the Moone is inferiour: the Moone hath not ſo much light as the Sunne, and that which it hath it hath from the Sunne: and as in gouerning, the king and other magiſtrates haue a fellowſhip, but in the meaſure, and manner of gouernment they are inferiour to him: Euen ſo is it betwixt man and wife, in many things wherein there is a fellowſhip, the wife is notwithſtanding inferiour: ſo as inferiority may ſtand with fellowſhip.
                  3. There are no vnequals betwixt which there is ſo neere a parity as betwixt man and wife: if therefore there may be a fellowſhip betwixt any that are ſuperiour, and inferiour one to another, then much more betwixt man and wife.
                  
                     Debet in vxorem vir dominari, vt animus in corpus, cōſentiens ei, & conſpirans beneuolentia. Plut. praec. connub. As the ſoule therefore ruleth ouer the body, by a mutuall and louing conſent and agreement, ſo muſt a man ouer his wife.
               
            
            
               §. 8. Of husbands too meane account of wiues.
               
               Contrary is the conceit of many who thinke there is no 
                     Non es dominus ſed maritus: non ancillam ſortitus es, ſed vxorem: gubernatorem

Hexaem. lib. 5. cap. 7. difference betwixt a wife and ſeruant but in familiarity: and that wiues were made to be ſeruants to their husbands, becauſe ſubiection, feare and obedience are required of them: whence it commeth to paſſe that wiues are oft vſed little better then ſeruants. A conceit and practiſe ſauouring too much of heatheniſh, and ſottiſh arrogancy. Did God at firſt take the wife out of mans ſide, that man ſhould tread her vnder his feet? or rather that he ſhould ſet her at his ſide next to him aboue all children, ſeruants, or any other in the family, how neere, or deare vnto him ſoeuer? for none can be neerer then a wife, and none ought to be dearer.

                  Treat 3. §. 5. IIII. Huſbands muſt account their owne wiues beſt for them. 
                  owne wiues.
               
               2. For the perſon of a wife, An husband ought to eſteeme that particular perſon to whom by Gods prouidence he is ioyned in mariage, to be the fitteſt, and beſt for him. This is implied vnder that particle of reſtraint (OWNE) noted by the Apoſtle where he ſaith 
                     Eph. 5. 25. 
                  husbands loue your OWNE wiues, and againe preſſeth it vnder a compariſon of the body (as 
                  
                     Veſ. 28. 
                  your OWNE bodies) Euery one thinketh his owne body beſt and fitteſt for him. A man might happily wiſh ſome defects or enormities in his owne body to be amended, and deſire that his were like an

others, more ſtrait, ſtrong, and comely then his owne, yet would he not haue his head to be vpon that other mans body: the ſame opinion ought a man (that would loue his wife) to haue of her.
               Good reaſon there is for him ſo to doe: for true is the prouerbe, 
                     Reaſon. Euery ones wife is prouided by God. if it be rightly taken, mariages are firſt made in heauen, that is, God hath an ouer-ruling hand in ordering them: which 
                     Pro. 19. 14. 
                  Salomon implieth by that oppoſition which he maketh betwixt wealth and a wife: that is from our fathers, this from the Lord: in which reſpect he ſaith, 
                     & 18. 22. 
                  he which findeth a wife receiueth fauour of the Lord. If therefore thou art loued of God, and loueſt him, he will make thy wife proue a good thing to thee.
               
                  
                     Obiect. A wife may be a very lewd and wicked woman: how then can ſhe be accounted the beſt wife?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. It may be ſhe was good enough when firſt ſhe was brought to thee, but thou by thine euill example, or negligent gouernment, or hard vſage, haſt made her ſo bad as ſhe is. Which if it be ſo, then is ſhe to be conſidered not as thou haſt marr'd her, but as thou diddeſt marie her.
                  2. Though ſhe be not in relation to other wiues the beſt in condition, yet in relation to thee ſhe may be the beſt in euent: if not for thine eaſe and quiet, yet for triall of thy wiſdome and patience: and ſo as 
                        Socrates interrogatus qua gratia vxoris mores toleraret, reſpondit, vt gymnaſium & palaeſtram philoſophiae domi habeam. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11.
a ſchoole of vertue ſhe may be vnto thee. As 
                        Ars tua Tiphy iacet ſi non ſit in aequore fluctus Ouid. de Triſt. l. 4. eleg. 3. a skilfull pilots ſufficiency is tried and knowne by tempeſtuous ſeas, ſo a mans wiſdome by a troubleſome wife. Yea ſhe may be giuen thee as a puniſhment of ſome former ſinnes, as ſeeking after a beautifull, honourable, rich, proper wife, rather then a religious and honeſt one: or ſeeking her without any direction or helpe firſt ſought of God, or otherwiſe then thou haſt warrant from God, as by ſtealth, and without parents conſent; or ſome other ſinnes in another kinde, to bring thee to repentance: or as a meanes to reſtraine and weane thee from ſome future ſinnes whereunto thou are ſubiect, and ſo proue a bleſſed croſſe to keepe thee from a fearefull curſe.
               
            
            
               §. 10. Of husbands prepoſterous opinion of their owne wiues.
               
               Contrary is a corrupt and peruerſe opinion which many haue of their owne wiues, thinking them of all other the worſt

and vnfitteſt; yea though they be ſuch as euery way both in gifts and qualities of minde, and alſo in grace and comelineſſe of body deſerue all good reſpect and eſteeme. Whereas others (which looke with a ſingle eye) commend their good parts, they Miſinterpret and miſiudge all: if their wiues be religious, they thinke them hypocrites: if graue, ſober and modeſt, melancholicke: if cheerefull, wanton: if they keepe at home, idle drones: if they take occaſion (though neuer ſo iuſt) of going abroad, gadders, and lightfooted. This bad opinion of their wiues is a cauſe that their hearts are cleane remoued from their owne, and ſet vpon ſtrange fleſh: whereby the deuill gaineth what he deſireth, that is, to put aſunder ſuch as God hath ioyned together, and to ioyne thoſe whom God hath put aſunder.
            
            
               §. 11. Of husbands 
                  Treat. 3. §. 7. V. Husbands muſt intirely delight in their wiues. 
                  intire affection to their wiues.
               
               An husbands affection to his wife muſt be anſwerable to his opinion of her: he ought therefore to delight in his wife intirely, that is, ſo to delight in her as wholly and only delighting in her: In this reſpect the Prophets wife is called the 
                     Ezec. 24. 16. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  deſire, or delight, or pleaſure of his eyes: that wherein he moſt of all delighted, and therefore by a propriety ſo called.
               Such delight did Iſaak take in his wife as it droue out a contrary ſtrong paſſion, namely the griefe which he tooke for the departure of his mother: for it is noted that he 
                  
                     Gen. 24. 67. 
                  loued her, and was comforted after his mothers death.
               
               This kinde of affection the wiſe-man doth elegantly ſet forth in theſe words, Reioyce with the wife of thy youth: Let her 
                  
                     Pro. 5. 18, 19. expounded. 
                  be as the louing Hinde, and pleaſant Roe, and be thou rauiſht alwaies with her loue. Here note both the metaphors, and alſo the hyperbole which are vſed to ſet forth an husbands delight in his wife. In the metaphors againe note both the creatures whereunto a wife is reſembled, and alſo the attributes giuen to them. The creatures are two, an Hind and a Roe, which are the females of an Hart and a Roe-Bucke: now it is noted of the Hart and Roe-Bucke, that of all other beaſts they are moſt inamored (as I may ſo ſpeake) with their mates, and euen mad againe in their heat and deſire after them.
               Theſe metaphors hath Salomon vſed to ſet forth that vnfained

and earneſt, intire and ardent affection which an husband ought to beare vnto his wife: which being taken in a good ſenſe, and rightly applied, ſo as they exceed not the bonds of chriſtian modeſty and decency, are very fit, and pertinent to the purpoſe: if we ſtretch them beyond modeſty, we wrong the pen-man of them, or rather the Holy Ghoſt that directed him, and propound a pernicious patterne vnto husbands.
               The attributes giuen to the forenamed creatures much amplifie the point: the former is termed a louing Hind, the latter 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Col. 1. 13. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . a pleaſant Roe, word for word an Hind of Loues, a Roe of fauour, that is, exceedingly loued and fauoured: (for to ſet forth the extent of Gods loue vnto his Sonne, Chriſt is called the ſonne of his loue:)
               
               Theſe compariſons applied to a wife, doe liuely ſet forth that delight which an husband ought to take in her, and yet is it much further amplified by the hyperbole vſed in this phraſe, be thou rauiſht with her loue, word for word erre thou in her loue, 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   by which no ſinfull error, or dotage is meant, but a lawfull earneſt affection: implying two things eſpecially: Firſt ſo far to exceed, as to make a man ouerſee ſome ſuch blemiſhes in his wife, as others would ſoone eſpie and miſlike: or elſe to count them no blemiſhes, delighting in her neuer a whit the leſſe for them. For example, if a man haue a wife, not very beautifull, or proper, but hauing ſome deformity in her body, ſome imperfection in her ſpeech, ſight, geſture, or any part of her body, yet ſo to affect her, and delight in her, as if ſhe were the faireſt, and euery way moſt compleat woman in the world. Secondly, ſo highly to eſteeme, ſo ardently to affect, ſo tenderly to reſpect her, as others may thinke him euen to doat on her. An husbands affection to his wife cannot be too great if it kept within the bonds of honeſty, ſobriety and comelineſſe. The wiues affection ought to be as great to her husband, yet becauſe of the husbands place of authority, he muſt eſpecially take all occaſions to manifeſt this his inward affection. Read the Song of Songs, and in it you ſhall obſerue ſuch affection manifeſted by Chriſt to his Spouſe, as would make one thinke he did (with reuerence in an holy manner to vſe the phraſe) euen erre in his loue and doat on her. A good patterne and

preſident for husbands. For nothing is more louely them a

               §. 12. Of the Stoicall diſpoſition of huſbands to their wiues.
               
               Contrary is the diſpoſition of ſuch husbands as haue no heat, or heart of affection in them: but Stoick-like delight no more in their owne wiues then in any other women, nor account them any dearer then others. A diſpoſition no way warranted by the word. The faithfull Saints of God before mentioned, as alſo many other like to them, were no Stoicks, without all affection: nor did they thinke it a matter vnbeſeeming them after a peculiar manner to delight in their wiues (witneſſe Iſaacks ſporting with his wife) for this is a priuiledge which appertaineth 
                     Gen. 26. 8. to the eſtate of mariage. But that I be not miſtaken herein, let it be noted that the affection whereof I ſpeake is not a carnall, ſenſuall, beaſtly affection, but ſuch an one as may ſtand with Chriſtian grauitie and ſo briety: hauing relation to the ſoule of a mans wife as well as to her body, grounded both on the neere coniunction of mariage, and alſo on the inward qualities of his wife.
               Thus farre of an husbands inward reſpect of his wife. It followeth to ſpeake of his outward cariage towards her.

                  kinde acceptance of ſuch things as his wife doth.
               
               
                  S. Peter giueth a generall rule for an husbands outward cariage to his wife, which is, that he dwell with her according to knowledge, that is, as a man able to order his cariage wiſely to his owne honour and his wiues good, that ſo ſhe may haue iuſt cauſe to bleſſe God that euer ſhe was ioyned to ſuch an huſband.
               Out of this generall theſe two branches ſprout forth.

                     1. That an husband giue no iuſt offence to his wife.
                     2. That wiſely he order that offence which is giuen by her.

                     2. To that which he doth as duty to her.
                  
               
               In regard of the former two things are requiſite:

                     
                        
1. That he kindly accept what ſhe is willing and able to doe.
                     2. That he wiſely commend and reward what ſhe doth well.
                  
               
               Thus hauing for orders ſake laid downe theſe heads, I will diſtinctly handle the ſeuerall points.
               The firſt particular wherein an husband ſheweth himſelfe VI. Husbands muſt kindly accept euery good duty of his wife. Gen. 21. 8. to be a man of knowledge in walking before his wife, is by a kinde and reſpectiue acceptation of euery good duty which his wife performeth. Abraham in teſtimony of his good acceptance of Sarahs pains in nurſing her childe, made a great feaſt when the childe was weined: and Elkanah on a like reſpect gaue liberty 1 Sam. 1. 23. to his wife to doe what ſeemed her beſt.
               
               A great incouragement muſt this needs be vnto wiues to be ſubiect vnto their husbands in all things, when they obſerue no part of their ſubiection to be careleſly neglected, but rather graciouſly accepted: it quickens the ſpirit of a wife to thinke that her care and pains in pleaſing her husband ſhall not be in vaine.
            
            
               §. 14. Of husbands ſleighting and reiecting their wiues goodneſſe.
               
               Contrary is their practiſe who thinking all which a wife Contrary, 1. To take no notice of their wiues goodneſſe. doth to be but her duty, take little or no notice thereof; or if they cannot but take notice of it, yet lightly regard it, and ſleightly paſſe it ouer. This oftentimes maketh a wife euen repent the good ſhe hath done, as Dauid repented the ſeruice 2. Sleightly to paſſe it ouer. 1 Sam. 25. 21. which he had done for Nabal. The truth is that wiues ought rather to looke vnto God for his acceptation then vnto their husbands: and though their husbands will take no notice, or not regard what good thing they doe, yet for conſcience ſake, and for the Lords ſake to doe their duty: But yet notwithſtanding conſidering our weakneſſe and backwardneſſe vnto euery duty, it can not be denied but that an husbands ſleight regarding of his wiues goodneſſe is an occaſion to make her weary thereof: and that he doth as much as in him lieth to make her repent thereof.
               But what may we ſay of ſuch as ſcornfully reiect their wiues 3. Scornfully to reiect it. duty, yea like them the worſe for making conſcience thereof,

and ſo (cleane contrary to the rule of chriſtianitie) ouercome goodneſſe with euill? Surely they ſhew a very diabolicall ſpirit 
                     Rom. 12. 21. to be in them: and cannot but miniſter much griefe, and offence to their wiues, and make that which they doe to be very irkſome and tedious. Fathers ought not to prouoke their 
                     Epheſ. 6. 4. children, much leſſe husbands their wiues.

               For the better conceiuing of this ſo needfull a point I will How a mans good acceptance of his wiues duty is manifeſted. ſomewhat more particularly and diſtinctly applie the ſame to the ſeuerall duties of a wife: which were drawne to two heads

Hexaem. lib. 5. cap. 7. husband by any reuerend behauiour, geſture, or ſpeech, he ought to meet her (as we ſay) in the middeſt of the way, and manifeſt his gratious acceptance thereof by ſome like courteous behauiour, geſture, and ſpeech, being ſeemely, not fooliſh.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Thus ſhall an husband abaſe himſelfe, and diſgrace his place.
                  
                     Anſw. The courteſie which I ſpeake of as it commeth from a ſuperiour, being a meere voluntary matter and a token Courteſie may ſtand with ſuperiority. of kindneſſe and fauour, is no abaſement of himſelfe, but an aduancement of his inferiour: a great grace to her, no diſgrace to him. Abram was counted of the Hittits a Prince of 
                     
                        Gen. 23. 6, 7. 
                     God, yet in communing with them he bowed vnto them. It is noted as a commendable thing in Eſau, that though at that time he was his brothers ſuperiour (at leaſt he tooke himſelfe ſo to be) yet obſeruing how Iaakob reuerenced him, bowing ſeuen times to the ground, he ranne to meet him, and embraced 
                     
                        Gen. 33. 3, 4. 
                     him, and fell on his necke. Moſt pertinent to the point is the example of King Ahaſhveroſh, who beholding Eſthers reuerend 
                        Eſth. 5. 2. ſtanding before him, held out his Scepter vnto her, which in a King is great courteſie.
                  But to put the matter out of all queſtion, let the example of Chriſt noted in Salomons ſong be obſerued, and we ſhall finde his courteſie euery way anſwering the reuerence of his Spouſe.
               
            
            
               
               §. 15. Of husbands too great loftineſſe.
               
               Contrary is a loftie carriage of husbands to their wiues, who ouerlooke all reuerence ſhewed by wiues, no more reſpecting their wiues in this caſe, then children or ſeruants: or then Kings doe reſpect the reuerence of their ſubiects.
               Oft haue I noted that there is a great difference betwixt a wife and all other inferiours, in which reſpect all euidences of reuerence ſhould much better be reſpected; yet we know that Kings and Queenes will put out their hands to be kiſſed by their ſubiects when they kneele before them, which is a token of courteſie: how much more ought husbands to ſhew courteſie? Vnworthy they are to be reuerenced of their wiues, who too Lord-like ouerlooke them.

                  Ahaſhueroſh afforded to Eſther:

                  Abraham to Sarah, and many other husbands to their wiues. 
                     & 21. 10. 11. 
                  Abraham ſhewed herein ſuch reſpect to his wife, that though the thing which ſhe deſired were grieuous to him, yet he yeelded to his wife.
               
                  
                     Obiect. God firſt commanded him ſo to doe.
                  
                     Anſw. This addeth the more force vnto the argument, ſhewing that it is Gods expreſſe will, that an husband ſhould ſhew this kinde of courteſie to his wife. Much more ought a man to doe at his wiues requeſt then at any others, whether friend, childe, or parent: yea much more free, forward and cheerefull ought he to ſhew himſelfe in granting his wiues requeſt then any others: prouided notwithſtanding that her deſire be of that which may lawfully be granted: to yeeld in things vnlawfull is to loſe his authoritie, as was ſhewed §. 5. before.
               
            
            
               §. 17. Of husbands harſhneſſe to their wiues.
               
               Contrary is the harſhneſſe of their diſpoſition who yeeld to their wiues requeſt as an hard-milch-cow letteth downe her milke, not without much adoe: whereby the grace of all their

yeelding is taken away. There can be no courteſie in yeelding, when it is againſt their minde and will forced from them: their wiues muſt aske, and intreat againe and againe, yea be forced to vſe the mediation of others to perſwade their huſbands to yeeld to their requeſt before they will yeeld, if at all they yeeld. What is this but to proclaime to all the world that there is no affection in them to their wiues? If a wiues breath be ſtrange to her husband, aſſuredly his heart is firſt ſtrange to her: which is the readie way to make him ſet his heart on ſtrange women.

                  muſt be ready to accept that wherein his wife ſheweth her ſelfe willing to obey him. He ought to be ſparing in exacting too much of her: in this caſe he ought ſo to frame his cariage towards her, as that obedience which ſhe performeth, may rather come from her owne voluntary diſpoſition, from a free conſcience to God-wards, euen becauſe God hath placed her in a place of ſubiection, and from a wiue-like loue, then from any exaction on her husbands part, and as it were by force.
               Husbands ought not to exact of their wiues, whatſoeuer 4. By forbearing to exact too much. wiues ought to yeeld vnto if it be exacted. They muſt obſerue what is lawfull, needfull, conuenient, expedient, fit for their wiues to doe, yea and what they are moſt willing to doe before they be too peremptorie in exacting it. For example.
               1. Though the wife ought to goe with her husband, and 5. By ſuffering her to dwell where it is meeteſt for her. dwell where he thinkes meet, yet ought not he (vnleſſe by vertue of ſome vrgent calling he be forced thereto) remoue her from place to place, and carrie her from that place where ſhe is well ſetled without her good liking.

By forbearing to tire her with gueſts. he bringeth into the houſe, yet ought not he to be grieuous and burdenſome therein vnto her: the greateſt care and pains for entertaining gueſts lyeth on the wife: ſhe ought therefore to be tendred therein.
               
                  
If he obſerue her conſcionable and wiſe, well able to manage 7. By ſuffering her to manage the affaires of the houſe. and order matters about houſe, yet loth to doe any thing without his conſent, he ought to be ready and free in yeelding his conſent, and ſatisfying her deſire, as 1 Sam. 1. 23., Elkanah: and if ſhe be baſhfull and backward in asking conſent, he ought voluntarily of himſelfe to offer it: yea and to giue her a generall conſent to order and diſpoſe matters as in her wiſdome ſhe ſeeth meet, as the ſaid Elkanah did: (Doe (ſaith he to his wife) what ſeemeth thee good:) and

               Contrary is the rigour and auſteritie of many husbands, who ſtand vpon the vttermoſt ſtep of their authoritie, and yeeld no more to a wife then to any other inferiour. Such are they

Too frequent impoſing of ſuch things, cannot but breed much weariſomneſſe. Vnſeaſonable (as when the wife is weake by ſickneſſe, childe-bearing, giuing ſucke or other like meanes, and ſo not able to giue that contentment which otherwiſe ſhe would) cannot but much diſquiet her, and giue her great offence.

               4. Who are ouer buſie in prying into euery buſineſſe of the houſe, and will haue their hand in all. Beſides that ſuch huſbands afford no opportunity to their wiues of giuing proofe of that vnderſtanding, wit, wiſdome, care, and other gifts which God hath endowed them withall, they take away that maine end for which a wife was giuen a man, namely, to be a

                     Gen. 2. 18. matters, which more properly belong vnto them. For obſerue it and you ſhall finde, that ſuch husbands as are moſt buſie about the priuate affaires of the houſe appertaining to their wiues, are moſt negligent of ſuch affaires as appertaine vnto themſelues: they thinke they walke in integrity, but yet are they not iuſt nor wiſe therein: for the iuſt man walketh in HIS integrity,

If a wiues fidelity (to whoſe good the welfare of the family, and increaſe of the ſtocke redoundeth as well as to the huſbands) be without iuſt cauſe ſuſpected, who ſhall be truſted? It is the ouerthrow of many families, that ſeruants are truſted, and not wiues.

               §. 21. Of husbands vngratefull diſcouraging their wiues.
               
               Contrary is an vngratefull, if not enuious diſpoſition of ſuch 
                     Quisque ſuam laudot, ſtudijs certamina creſcunt. Ouid. Faſt. lib. 2. husbands, as paſſing by many good things ordinarily and vſually euery day done by their wiues without any approbation, commendation or remuneration, are ready to diſpraiſe the leaſt ſlip, or neglect in them; and that in ſuch generall termes as if they neuer did any thing well, ſo as their wiues may well complaine and ſay as it is in the prouerbe,
               
                  
                     Oft did I well, and that heare I neuer:
                  
                  
                     Once did I ill, and that heare I euer.
                  
               
               Yet ſuch will be ready to praiſe other mens wiues, and vp braid their owne wiues with the examples of thoſe other, when their owne doe farre excell them in all kinde of goodneſſe. What doth this ſhew but that either they take no notice of their own wiues goodneſſe, or elſe by reaſon of the commonneſſe thereof little regard it? If their wiues haue not the more grace in them, this diſpoſition is enough not only to diſcourage them from doing any good duty, but alſo to breed iealouſie in them, and to alienate their hearts from them.
            
            
               §. 22. Of an husbands 
                  Treat. 3. §. 10. 
                  mildneſſe.
               
               Hitherto of that reſpect which an husband is to haue of that duty which his wife performeth to him.
               For auoiding iuſt offence, an husband muſt further haue good reſpect to that which as duty he doth to his wife. As kindly he muſt accept duty at his wiues hands, ſo mildly he muſt performe that Oportet virum praecſſe vxori oblectando, & indulgendo. Plut. praec. Connub. duty which he oweth to her.
               This mildneſſe is an eſpeciall fruit, and euidence of loue, and a notable meanes to take away all offence that otherwiſe might be taken from many things which he doth. Sugar and Hony are not more pleaſant to the tongue, then mildneſſe to the heart; it cauſeth ſuch things as otherwiſe are irkſome and grieuous to the ſoule, to be well taken and applied, euen as bitter pils dipt in ſweet ſyrrop, or rolled vp in the ſoft pap of

an apple, are ſoone ſwallowed downe and well digeſted. If an husband deſire to be accounted a ſeruant of the Lord he muſt learne this leſſon: For the ſeruant of the Lord muſt be gentle to all men. If any other ſeruant of the Lord, much more huſbands: 2 Tim. 2. 24. if to all men, moſt of all to their wiues: and that in many reſpects.

                     1. Becauſe of the neere vnion betwixt man and wife.
                     2. Becauſe of the ioynt authority ſhe hath with him ouer others: that herein he may be a preſident and example to her.
                     3. Becauſe of her weakneſſe: glaſſes are tenderly handled: a ſmall knocke ſoone breakes them.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 23. Of husbands bitterneſſe.
               
               Contrary is bitterneſſe, a vice expreſly forbidden, and that in particular to husbands. A vice that cannot ſtand with an huſband-like loue: whereupon the Apoſtle commanding the one forbiddeth the other, Loue (ſaith he) and be not bitter. Nothing 
                     Col. 3 19. more turneth the edge of his authority, peruerteth the vſe of his gouernment, prouoketh the ſtomacke of his wife, maketh his words and deeds leſſe regarded, then bitterneſſe. It is as gall and wormwood mixed with ſweet and wholeſome meats, which cauſeth that they cannot be well digeſted, but with violence are ſpit out againe ſo ſoone as euer they be taſted. Men in authority are much prone hereunto: and therefore O husbands be ſo much the more watchfull againſt it, loue your wiues and be not bitter vnto them.

                  Titles which an husband giueth to his wife.
               
               
                  
                     
                        The forenamed mildeneſſe of an huſband muſt be manifeſted in his

               For ſo far as reuerence extends it ſelfe in the duties of wiues, muſt mildneſſe be extended in the duties of husbands.
               Whether an husbands ſpeech be to his wife before her face, or of her 
                  Of his ſpeech about her behinde her backe, See Treat. 2. Part. 2. §. 36. The ſpeech of husbands to their wiues ſweetned with mildneſſe. behinde her backe, it muſt be ſweetned with mildneſſe.
               1. For his ſpeech to her, 1. The titles wherewith he calleth her. 2. The inſtructions which he giueth her. 3. The commandements which he layeth vpon her. 4. The reproofes wherewith he checketh her, muſt all be mixed with mildneſſe.
               
               Among other titles, the moſt ordinary and vſuall title (wife) 
                  1. Mild and kinde titles.
                  
is a milde and kinde title, and leaſt offenſiue of all other: if an husband giue any other title to his wife, it muſt be ſuch an one as manifeſteth kindneſſe, familiaritie, loue, and delight. Such are all the titles which Chriſt giueth to the Church, as Spouſe, Loue, Doue, with the like. I doe not deny but that in the Song of Salomon, and in other places of Scripture many titles are giuen and ſpeeches vſed by Chriſt to the Church which are not meet to be vſed by husbands to their wiues, becauſe they are metaphoricall, and hyperbolicall: but yet in them all we may obſerue tokens of amiableneſſe, kindneſſe, and mildneſſe, which is the end for which I haue alledged his example.
               But contrary are ſuch titles as on the one ſide ſet the wife Contrary, vnſeemely titles. in too high a place ouer her husband, as Lady, Miſtreſſe, Dame, Mother, &c. And on the other ſide ſet her in too meane a rancke, as woman, wench, &c. And their Chriſtian names contracted, as Sal, Mal, Beſſe, Nan. &c. and names of kindred, as Siſter, and Coſen: and, opprobrious names, as ſtut, drab, queant; and names more befitting beaſts then wiues, as Cole, Browne, Muggle, &c.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Theſe are titles of mildneſſe, kindneſſe, and much familiarity: for husbands call their wiues by theſe names, not when they are angry with them and diſpleaſed, but ordinarily, and vſually, euen when they are beſt pleaſed.
                  
                     Anſw. The mildneſſe and familiarity which is required of an husband muſt be ſuch as may ſtand with his authority and place of eminency (as ſome of thoſe names doe not,) and with that neere coniunction which is betwixt man and wife about all others (as other doe not,) and with Chriſtian grauity and diſcretion (as other doe not.) Chriſtians therefore muſt take heed that by their practiſe they iuſtifie not corrupt cuſtomes.
               
            
            
               §. 25. Of an husbands manner of inſtructing his wife.
               
               2. To inſtruction the Apoſtle expreſly annexeth meekneſſe, 
                  Inſtruction to be giuen with meekneſſe. 
                  Inſtruct (ſaith he) with meekeneſſe, thoſe that oppoſe themſelues. If miniſters muſt vſe meekeneſſe when they inſtruct their people, much more husbands when they inſtruct their wiues: if 2 Tim. 2. 25. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . in caſe of oppoſition meekeneſſe muſt not be laid aſide, then in no caſe, at no time.
               
                  
In this caſe to manifeſt meekeneſſe, let theſe rules be obſerued. Directions to inſtruct with meekeneſſe.
               
               1. Note the vnderſtanding and capacity of thy wife, and accordingly fit thine inſtructions: if ſhe be of meane capacity, giue precept vpon precept, line vpon line, here a little and there a little: a little at once oft giuen (namely euery day ſomething) will ariſe in time to a great meaſure, and ſo ariſe, as, together with knowledge of the thing taught, loue of the perſon that teacheth will increaſe.
               2. Inſtruct her in priuate betwixt thy ſelfe and her, that ſo her ignorance may not be blazed forth: priuate actions paſſing betwixt man and wife are tokens of much kindneſſe and familiarity.
               3. In the family ſo inſtruct children and ſeruants when ſhe is preſent, as ſhe may learne knowledge thereby: there can be no more meeke and gentle manner of inſtructing, then by one to inſtruct another.
               4. Together with thy precepts mixe ſweet and pithy perſwaſions, Contrary, harſhneſſe. which are teſtimonies of great loue.
               Contrary is an harſh and rough manner of inſtructing, when husbands goe about to thruſt into their wiues heads, as it were by violence, deepe myſteries which they are not able to conceiue, and yet if they conceiue not, they will be angry with them, and in anger giue them euill language, and proclaime their ignorance before children, ſeruants, and ſtrangers. This harſhneſſe is ordinarily ſo fruitleſſe, and withall ſo exaſperateth a womans ſpirit, as I thinke he were better cleane omit the duty then doe it after ſuch a manner.
            
            
               §. 26. Of an husbands manner of 
                  Treat. 3. §. 43, 51, 52. 63, 64. &c. Commandements to be ordered with mildneſſe. 
                  commanding his wife any thing.
               
               3. The commandements which an husband giueth to his wife, whether they be affirmatiue (bidding her to doe ſomething) or negatiue (forbidding her to doe this or that) muſt all be ſeaſoned with mildneſſe. For which end reſpect muſt be had to the matter and manner of his commandements.
               In regard of the matter the things which he commandeth What things he may command his wife. his wife to doe, muſt be

                     1. Such as are indeed lawfull and honeſt.
                     
                        
2. Such as ſhe is perſwaded to be ſo.
                     3. Such as beſeeme her place.
                     4. Such as are of weight and moment.
                  
               
               And on the contrary, the things which he forbiddeth muſt be

                     1. Such as are indeed vnlawfull to be done. What things he may forbid his wife.
                     
                     2. Such as he can euidently proue vnto her to be vnlawfull.
                     3. Such as are vnbeſeeming her place.
                     4. Such as will haue ſome euill and miſchieuous effect if they be done.
                  
               
               1. To command a thing vnlawfull, or forbid a thing which ought to be done, is to bring his owne authority into oppoſition with Gods: in which caſe he bringeth his wife into this ſtrait, either to reiect Gods commandement or his. How then can ſhe thinke that her husband loueth her, when he bringeth her into ſuch ſnares and ſtraits, that ſhe muſt needs fall into the gulfe of Gods diſpleaſure, or knocke againſt the rocke of her husbands offence? Mildneſſe is farre from ſuch commandements.
               2. The like may be ſaid of ſuch things as to a wiues conſcience Such things as a wife maketh doubt of, not to be preſſed vpon her. ſeeme to be ſinnefull, if they be enioyned to her; or her bounden duty, if they be forbidden: eſpecially if ſhe haue any ground for her conſcience out of Gods word. The conſcience is ſubiect to God alone: if it be forced it will be a fearefull horror, and a very hell in that party whoſe conſcience is forced: She that doubteth is condemned if ſhe doe that whereof 
                     Rom. 14. 23. ſhe maketh doubt.
               
                  1. Obiect. In doubtfull matters the commanding power Of what doubtfull things the commanding power of a gouernour may be a warrant. of a gouernour is ſufficient warrant and ground to reſolue the conſcience of them that are vnder authority.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. In things meerely doubtfull concerning which the partie in ſubiection hath not warrant out of Gods word one way or other, it may be ſo. But when the conſcience doth not doubt and hang in ſuſpence, but is out of ſome ground taken from Gods word perſwaded that that which is commanded is vnlawfull, or that which is forbidden is a bounden dutie, then to doe this, or to leaue that vndone, is to the party ſo perſwaded a ſinne: and this is the doubting (whereof the

Apoſtle ſpeaketh) that condemneth a man. In this caſe to vrge a wife to doe this, or not to doe that, is to vrge her to ſinne: which a milde ſpirit and louing heart will not doe.
                  2. Though the husbands command be ſufficient warrant to the wife, and if he peremptorily preſſe her to this or that, ſhe ought to yeeld, yet the loue and mildneſſe required of an husband ſhould make him ſo to tender her as to remit ſomething of his power, and when he ſeeth her conſcience troubled about his command, to releeue her conſcience by for bearing to preſſe that which ſeemeth ſo burthenſome to her. A husband may ſinne in preſſing that too much vpon his wife, which ſhe vpon his preſſing may without ſinne yeeld vnto.
               
            
            
               §. 27. Of an husbands 
                  Treat. 4. §. 66. 
                  wiſe carriage when his wife is erroneeuſly ſcrupulous.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. What if an husband vpon his knowledge obſerue his wife to be erroneouſly ſcrupulous, and to miſinterpret and miſapply the word of God which ſhe maketh the ground of her ſcruple?
                  
                     Anſw. He muſt firſt labour to reſolue her conſcience by a plaine diſcouery of her error; which is a true and a great token of loue: if notwithſtanding all that he can doe in that kinde ſhe cannot be brought to yeeld to that which he would haue, then he muſt carefully obſerue theſe two things.

                        1. Whether her refuſing to yeeld, be an obſtinacy, or weakeneſſe.
                        2. Whether it be about a ſleight or weighty matter.
                     
                  
                  By the reaſons which ſhe rendreth, and her manner of preſſing How a wiues refuſing to yeeld may be diſcerned to be on obſtinacy or weakeneſſe. them, he may diſcerne whether weakeneſſe or obſtinacy make her ſtand out againſt him: if the reaſon which ſhe reſteth on taken from Gods word be doubtfull, and to one that hath not a good ſound iudgement, and a ſharpe diſcerning wit, it may appeare to make ſomething for her, it is to be preſuppoſed that there is more weakeneſſe then ſtoutneſſe in her. But if ſhe can render no good reaſon, but only take euery ſhew that any way ſeemeth to incline to her words, and peremptorily holdeth the concluſion, and ſtifly ſtandeth on her owne reſolution, though the vanity of her pretences be euidently diſcouered to her, ſo as ſhe hath not any thing further to obiect;

or if ſhe render no reaſon at all but her owne thought, conceit and will, and yet refuſeth to yeeld, ſurely obſtinacy poſſeſſeth her heart. In caſe of obſtinacy it is very expedient that an husband ſtand vpon his power to maintaine his authority, and by the beſt wiſdome he can (vſing only ſuch meanes as are lawfull) bring her to yeeld from her ſtoutneſſe to that which he requireth: eſpecially if the matter be weighty: as in caſe a religious man haue been maried to a Popiſh wife, and ſhe by no reaſon will be moued to forbeare going to Maſſe, or yeeld to goe to the preaching of the Goſpell. But if through weakeneſſe ſhe cannot be perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of that her husband requireth, and the matter required be of no great conſequence, nor the weakeneſſe of her conſcience cauſe any great error, an husband ought ſo farre to manifeſt his mildneſſe as to forbeare to preſſe her conſcience.
               
            
            
               §. 28. Of an husbands 
                  Treat. 3. §. 43, 44. &c.
                   
                  forbearing to preſſe things vnbeſeeming a wiues place.
               
               3. Things vnbeſeeming the place of a wife are diſhonourable vnto her: for an husband to vrge his wife by ſtrict charge to doe them, implieth more rigorouſneſſe then mildneſſe. Had the ſpirit of that ſtout Monarch Ahaſhueroſh beene more milde towards his wife, he would not haue ſo farre preſſed his wife vnto ſo vnſeemly a thing as he did, namely, to come before all his Princes and people to make ſhew of her beautie. It is true indeed (as we ſhewed Treat. 3. §. 28. before) that ſhe offended in refuſing to yeeld thereunto, he peremptorily requiring it; but that offence on her part doth not juſtifie his fact, and free him from all blame: it is noted, that he was merry with wine, when he gaue that commandement, 
                     Eſt. 1. 10. whereby is intimated, that his practiſe was more beſeeming a drunken, then a ſober man: ſuch is their practiſe who exact of their wiues to doe ſuch buſineſſes as beſeeme maid-ſeruants rather then wiues, or ſtrumpets rather then honeſt women; as to goe to tauernes, ale-houſes, play-houſes, and ſuch places where light companions be.
            
            
               §. 29. Of an husbands preſſing his authoritie in weighty matters.
               
               4. To vſe a mans authoritie about weightie matters, matters of moment, maketh it to haue ſuch weight in it, as it will much better

be regarded: for thus a wife will either be brought to yeeld vnto that which is commanded, or to condemne her ſelfe for not yeelding: yea thus a wife may ſee, that it is not his owne will ſo much which maketh him to vſe his authoritie in commanding, as the neceſſitie of the thing it ſelfe, which redoundeth eſpecially to her good that doth it: for the performance of a dutie is for the moſt part moſt aduantageable to the partie that performeth it, ſo as hereby an husband ſheweth loue to his wife in preſſing that which he preſſeth.
               This token of loue that it may the better appeare, it is behouefull Reaſons of preſſing a cō
                     mandement to be rendred. that an husband adde to his commandement iuſt & weightie reaſons, that thereby his wife may the better diſcerne the meetneſſe, lawfulneſſe, expediencie, and neceſſitie of the things commanded. We know that all the things which God commandeth are weightie and neceſſarie: yea his will (being the very rule, and ground of all goodneſſe) maketh things abſolutely neceſſarie, yet vnto his commandements he vſeth to adde weightie reaſons; ſhewing on the one ſide the benefit and bleſſedneſſe that will come to ſuch as obey his commandements; and on the other ſide, the miſchiefe and miſerie that will fall on their pates who refuſe to obey; whereby he ſheweth the great good reſpect which he beareth to vs, and the earneſt deſire he hath of our good. Thus may an husband euen in his commandements ſhew much loue and kindneſſe.
            
            
               §. 30. Of husbands too great pride in commanding.
               
               Contrary is the peremptorie pride of husbands, when they will haue their owne will done: it booteth not whether the thing commanded be lawfull or vnlawfull, whether their wiues conſciences can yeeld vnto it or no, whether it ſtand with the honour of their places or no, and whether it be weightie or light; their will it is it ſhould be done, and done it ſhall be, there is all the reaſon they will giue. Some thinke it a glory to command what they liſt; and thinke that there is no proofe of their authoritie, and of their wiues ſubiection, but in ſuch things as vpon their own will, without any further ground or reaſon, they command. If ſuch husbands meet with confronts; if though they command much, they finde not anſwerable performance; they may thanke themſelues,

who runne the ready courſe to haue their authoritie contemned and euen troden vnder foot.
            
            
               §. 31. Of husbands rare and milde vſing their commanding power.
               
               Reſpect muſt be had by husbands to the manner of vſing their authoritie in commanding as well as to the matter.
               
               In regard of the manner his commandements muſt be

                     1. Rare, not too frequent.
                     2. By way of intreating, not too peremptorie.
                  
               
               Authoritie is like a ſword, which with ouer much vſing will 1. Commanding muſt be rare. be blunted, and ſo faile to doe that ſeruice which otherwiſe it might when there is moſt need. A wiſe, graue, peaceable man, may alwayes haue his ſword in readineſſe, and that alſo very bright, keene, and ſharpe: but he will not be very ready to plucke it out of his ſcabberd; he rather keepeth it for a time of need, when it ſhould ſtand him in moſt ſteed. Such husbands therefore as are too frequent in their commands, ſhew themſelues nor graue, nor wiſe, nor louers of peace.
               As the vſe of an husbands authoritie in commanding muſt be 2. Commanding muſt be by way of intreating. Philem. 9. rare, ſo when there is occaſion to vſe it, it muſt be with ſuch mildneſſe and moderation tempered, ſo as (according to Saint Pauls example) though he haue power to command that which is conuenient, yet for loues ſake he rather intreat it. Note how mildly Abram frameth his ſpeech to his wife, Say I pray thee 
                  
                     Gen. 12. 13. (ſaith he) thou art my ſister. Though the thing he required fauoured of too much weakneſſe, yet his manner of requiring it was well beſeeming a kinde husband.
            
            
               §. 32. Of husbands inſolencie and peremptorineſſe.
               
               Contrary is the inſolencie of many, who cannot ſpeake to their wiues, but in commanding-wiſe. Their authoritie is like a ſwaggerers ſword, which cannot long reſt in the ſheath, but vpon euery ſmall occaſion is drawne forth. This frequent vſe of commanding, maketh their commandements nought regarded. The like may be ſaid of them who are too peremptorie in commanding: there muſt be no ſaying of nay, to that which they ſay: vpon command they will haue their minde done, and no other way: no perſwaſion, no intreatie ſhall be vſed: they will rather not at all haue their will done, then not vpon abſolute command: nay they

will not ſuffer others, in caſe of any refuſall, to intreat, or perſwade, but will try what abſolutely they can doe by authoritie. Thus as by trying to bend ſteele how farre it will goe, it oft breaketh; ſo by putting their authoritie to the vttermoſt triall, they oft loſe all their authoritie: in which caſe the mends (as we ſpeake) is in their owne hands.
               
            
            
               §. 33. Of an husbands 
                  Treat. 3. §. 47. Husbands ought to reproue. 
                  reprouing his wife.
               
               4. The authoritie and charge which God hath giuen to an husband ouer his wife, doe require that as good and iuſt occaſion is offered, he ſhould reproue her: for this is an eſpeciall meanes to draw her from thoſe ſinnes, wherein otherwiſe ſhee might liue and lie, yea and die alſo; and ſo liue, lie, and die vnder Gods wrath: out of which miſerie and wretchedneſſe to free a wife, is as great a token of loue, as to pull her out of the water when ſhe is in danger of drowning, or out of the fire when ſhe is in danger of burning. Solomon thus ſtileth reproofes, 
                     Pro. 15. 31. 
                  reproofes of life, and expreſly noteth 
                     & 6. 23. 
                  reproofes to be the way of life, a meanes to breed and preſerue ſpirituall life, and to bring one vnto eternall life, and ſo to eſcape death and damnation. In theſe reſpects rebukes are called a pretious balme, or excellent oyle, which may heale a wound, but make none: it 
                     Pſal. 141. 5. See the fruits of reproofe, Treat. 3. §. 47. 
                  breaketh not the head, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh. Vpon this ground, no doubt, it is noted of many good husbands, who were without all queſtion, louing, kinde, meeke, and milde husbands, that they reproued their wiues: as 
                     Gen. 30. 2. 
                  Iaakob,

               §. 34. Of neglecting reproofe.
               
               Contrary is a ſeruile and timorous minde of many husbands, who are loth to offend, and (as they thinke) to prouoke their wiues; and thereupon chuſe rather to let them continue in ſinne, then tell them of it. Wherein they both diſhonour their place, and the image of God, which by vertue of their place they carry, and alſo in effect and in truth hate their wiues; which the Law implieth, where it ſaith, Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart,

                  well ordering reproofe in the matter thereof.
               
               That an husband may euidently demonſtrate that his reprouing of his wife is indeed a fruit of his loue, he muſt haue an eſpeciall

care to ſweeten it, eſpecially with mildneſſe: for it is the bittereſt pill that by an husband can be giuen to a wife. It is a verball correction, & in that reſpect a middle meanes (as I may ſo ſpeake) betwixt admonition and correction; partaking ſomewhat of both: it goeth no further then words, and ſo is an admonition: the words of a reproofe are ſharpe, and ſo it is a correction: though it be but a milde correction, yet it is a ſharpe admonition; and all the correction which by himſelfe an husband can giue his wife: for we ſhall §. 44. after ſhew that he may not proceed to blowes, and ſtrokes.
               To ſweeten reproofe with mildneſſe reſpect muſt be had (as before was noted of commanding) both to the matter, and alſo to the manner thereof.

               Iuſtice requireth that it be a truth, and a knowne truth, euen a thing whereof he is aſſured, for which he reproueth his wife. Chriſt in giuing direction for reprouing aright, layeth downe this as a ground, If thy brother ſhall treſpaſſe, &c. a treſpaſſe 
                     Matth. 18. 15. therefore muſt goe before reproofe: where no treſpaſſe is, there reproofe is vniuſt.
               Againe, the Apoſtle aduiſeth that an accuſation ſhould not 1 Tim 5. 19. be receiued but vnder two, or three witneſſes; whereby he implieth that a light report muſt not be receiued, but where blame is laid, there muſt be two or three witneſſes to confirme it, ſo as he that cenſureth may haue good and ſure ground for that which he doth: indeed that aduiſe was in particular giuen about an elder, but from the leſſe to the greater it will follow to be a good aduiſe concerning wiues: for no kinde of perſon muſt be more warie in laying blame vpon another and reproouing for the ſame, then an husband on his wife.
               Equitie further requireth that the matter for which an huſband 2. Weigh. y. reproueth his wife be weightie; namely for ſome fault that is dangerous to her ſoule, hurtfull to their eſtate, contagious by reaſon of ill example to children, and others in the family, but moſt of all for ſinne againſt God which prouoketh his wrath, and pulleth downe his heauie curſe vpon him, her, and the whole family.
               When that for which a wife is reproued is a truth, a knowne

truth, and a weightie truth, the husband in performing this dutie iuſtifieth his deed, ſheweth that there was need thereof, and ſo giueth euidence of his loue, maketh his reproofe to pierce the more deeply, and ſo maketh her the more aſhamed of her fault; whence it will follow, that either ſhe will amend her fault or at leaſt will haue her mouth ſtopped, ſo as ſhe ſhall haue nothing to except againſt it. The reproofe of the three Saints before mentioned, 
                     Gen. 30. 2. 
                  Iaakob, 
                  
                     Iob 2. 10. 
                  Iob, and 2 Sam. 6. 21, 22. 
                  Dauid, were anſwerable to theſe points of Iuſtice and wiſdome: and the effects thereof anſwerable to thoſe which we haue noted in this reaſon, as the ſilence of the three wiues implieth: for none of them replied againe.
            
            
               §. 36. Of vndue reproofe.
               
               Contrary to the forenamed Iuſtice and equitie are ouerlight Contrary, 1. Credulitie. 
                  credulitie and vndue ſuſpicion. Credulitie is when credence is giuen to euery light report, and thereupon blame laid vpon the wife before any iuſt proofe be made of that for which ſhe is blamed: whereby it oft commeth to paſſe, that ſhe is wrongfully and vniuſtly blamed: which if ſhe be, what good fruit can proceed from ſuch reproofes? yea what euill fruits are not like to proceed from thence, as ſecret diſcontent (if not malice and hatred) and open contentions and brawlings?
               The like may be ſaid of light and cauſeleſſe ſuſpicion, which 2. Suſpicion. is the mother of iealouſie, and the very bane of mariage, from whence the deuill taketh great aduantage againſt them both, ſeeking thereby to vnlooſe that knot which God hath ſo firmly knit betwixt them. Suſpicion to the minde is as a coloured glaſſe to the eie, which repreſenteth things to the ſight not as indeed they are in their owne true colour, but as the colour of the glaſſe is. Suſpicion will make a man peruert euery thing that his wife doth, and blame her many times for ſuch things as are praiſe-worthy: in which caſe what can be thought, but that an husband ſeeketh aduantage againſt his wife, rather then any good vnto her?
               If to thoſe two forenamed vices (credulity and ſuſpicion) he 3. Raſhneſſe.

                  mall and light matter which any way he diſliketh, matter of

reproofe, doth he not proclaime to all that ſhall know it, that he loues chiding more then he loues his wife? Yea is not this the ready way to make all his reproofe (if not ſcorned) lightly regarded? What then will be the profit of them?
            
            
               §. 37. Whether an husband may reprooue his wife for ſuch things as he is guilty of.
               
               To the matter of reproofe ſome adde, that an husband ought not to reproue his wife for that fault whereof he himſelfe is guiltie: but I make doubt of this direction. I denie not but that he ought to haue an eſpeciall care that he be not guiltie of that crime for which he blameth his wife; otherwiſe, 1. he blunteth the edge of his reproofe, ſo as readily it cannot peirce into her heart. 2. He cauſeth it to rebound backe againe vpon himſelfe with theſe reproches, Phyſitian healethy 
                  
                     Luk 4. 23. Mat. 7. 5. Rom. 2. 21. Rom. 2. 1. 
                  ſelfe: Hypocrite firſt caſt the beame out of thine owne eye. Thou that teacheſt another teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? 3. He is an heauy witneſſe againſt himſelfe; for in that he iudgeth another he condemneth himſelfe. But thereupon to infer, that becauſe he is guiltie of ſuch vices as are in his wife, he ought not to reproue her though ſhe be worthy to be reproued, is ſcarſe ſound and good diuinitie: for thus he maketh himſelfe guilty of a double fault, one of committing the ſinne himſelfe, the other of ſuffering his wife to lie therein: whereas if he reproued his wife, he might thereby reclaime both her and himſelfe: for I doubt not but his reprouing of his wife would ſtrike deeper into his owne conſcience then if a third ſhould reproue them both. How were Iudah and Dauid ſtroken to 
                     Gen. 38. 26. 2 Sam. 12. 13. the heart after they had giuen ſentence againſt ſuch crimes as they themſelues were guiltie of? It is a good aduice that no man be guiltie of that which he reproueth in his wife, but it is no good rule to ſay, no man ought to reproue his wife of that whereof he is guiltie.

neceſſary occaſion, 1. It ſheweth that an husband taketh no delight in rebuking his wife, but is euen forced thereto. 2. It maketh his wife much more regard it. 3. It is like to worke a more perfect cure, for ſeldome and rare reproofes doe commonly peirce moſt deeply.
               Contrary is continuall chiding, and finding fault with a Contrary, continuall chiding. wife for euery thing amiſſe: if not only the wife her ſelfe, but a childe, or ſeruant, or any elſe in the houſe doe amiſſe, the wife ſhall be blamed for it. This is too common a fault in huſbands: whereby they much prouoke their wiues; yea and many times make them no more regard a reproofe then any other word. For as birds which alwaies abide in Belfries where much ringing is, are not a whit afrighted with their lowd ſound; ſo wiues who haue their eares from time to time filled with their husbands rebuke, by vſe are brought, nothing at all to be moued therewith.
               2. That a reproofe muſt be giuen in meekneſſe is cleere by 2. Reproue mildly. Gal 6. 1. the Apoſtles generall precept of reſtoring one in the ſpirit of meekneſſe: for a right manner of reprouing is thereby particularly intended. Now of all with whom we haue to doe, no fitter obiect for meekneſſe then a wife, who in a more peculiar manner then any other is thine owne fleſh.
               
               
                  Meekneſſe hath reſpect both to ſecrecie of place, and to ſoftneſſe of words.

Thus will it alſo ſoake better into her ſoule, when no conceit of diſhonour and diſcredit ſhall ariſe vp to hinder the worke of it: which conceits will be ready to ariſe when a reproofe is giuen in publike before others. Thus likewiſe will occaſion be taken away from children and ſeruants of deſpiſing her: which otherwiſe they would quickly take,

He may follow Chriſts direction, Take one or two more, namely wiſe, graue, faithfull friends, if it may be, of her kindred, as her parents (if ſhe haue any liuing) or ſuch as are in courſe of nature next to parents (if they be not partiall on her ſide) and before them rebuke her: but by no meanes before any of the houſe vnder her gouernment.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. What if her fault be publicke, ſuch an one as Direction for reprouing a wife whoſe offence is publike. may be an ill example to them of the houſe, it being committed in their ſight, or brought ſome other way to their knowledge?
                  
                     Anſw. Wiſely he muſt ſo manifeſt his diſlike of her fault, as he no way impaire her honour: he may therefore declare that ſuch a thing was not well done, and fore-warne his houſhold of committing the like; yea roundly threaten them that if any of them doe the like they ſhall dearely repent it; and if ſuch as are vnder correction offend therein, the more ſurely and ſeuerely correct them, euen becauſe they haue taken example. Thus ſhall he teſtifie a great good reſpect of his wife, and alſo a thorow diſlike and hatred of her ſinne.

If therefore an husband looke to doe good by reprouing his wife, his reproofe muſt be ſo ordered, as it may ſeeme to be rather a gentle admonition, then a ſharpe rebuke. He may and ought plainly to declare her fault vnto her, but in milde and meeke tearmes, without reuiling, opprobrious and ignominious words.

Iob 2. 10. vſed: as the reproofes of Iaakob, Iob, and Dauid doe ſhew, for they were euery one of them ſharpe: but yet this ſharpneſſe muſt not be made bitter by any euill language. A womans wickedneſſe may not moue an husband to be froward, and 2 Sam. 6. 21, 22. Rebuke neuer to be giuen by a man in paſſion. outragious; but rather to be the more watchfull ouer himſelfe, that he containe himſelfe within the bounds of diſcretion and moderation. For which end it is meete that husbands lay it

downe for a rule, neuer to rebuke their wiues when they are in paſſion. Paſſion raiſeth a darke miſt before the eies of reaſon; which, while it remaineth, keepeth reaſon from giuing any good direction. Yea paſſion is as a fire, and it ſo incenſeth a man, and diſtempereth him, that in his diſorder he can keepe no meane or meaſure. Howſoeuer a man be not able to rule himſelfe when paſſion is ſtirred vp, yet, if before hand while his eie is ſingle, and his whole body light, while he is in tune (as we 
                        Mat. 6. 22. ſpeake) and well tempered, he reſoluedly determine with himſelfe not to doe ſuch or ſuch a thing in his paſſion; that fore-going reſolution will be an eſpeciall means to make him forbeare doing that in paſſion, which if he ſhould doe, he could not in paſſion well order and moderate. For if once he begin to doe a thing in paſſion, the leaſt prouocation that can be, will be as bellowes to blow vp that fire into a flame.
                  In regard of the violence of paſſion (wherein women by Rebuke to be put off while a wife is in paſſion. reaſon of the weakneſſe of their iudgement are for the moſt part moſt violent) it is alſo the part of a wiſe man to forbeare this duty of reprouing his wife euen when ſhe is in paſſion. For as it is needfull that he ſhould be in caſe well to giue a reproofe, ſo as needfull it is that ſhe ſhould be in caſe well to take a rebuke. Paſſion both filleth and feſtereth ones heart. The heart then being full of paſſion, what roome is left for good aduice? will a man powre wine into a veſſell full of water, or ſtay, till all the water be dreaned out?
                  The heart alſo being ſo feſtered as it ſauoureth of nothing but paſſion, what good can then good aduice doe?
                  It is therefore an eſpeciall point of wiſdome, and ſheweth a good reſpect that a man beareth to his wife, yea it ſauoureth of much meekneſſe and moderation for an husband, well to weigh both his owne and his wiues temper when he reproueth her, and to forbeare doing it while either he or ſhe be in paſſion.
               
            
            
               §. 39. Of vndiſcreet reproouing a wife.
               
               Contrary is the indiſcretion of husbands who regard nor place, nor perſons, nor time, nor temper of themſelues or their wiues, nor any other circumſtance in reprouing, but like Saul (who at a table where a great feaſt was, in preſence of his Nobles

and Captaines, when he was inraged with anger, with moſt virulent and bitter ſpeeches not rebuked onely but reproached alſo his ſonne, and that with ſuch words as he ſpared not his owne wife; for in his paſſion he called his ſonne, ſonne 
                  1 Sam. 20. 30. 
                  of the peruerſe rebellious woman:) like this fooliſh and furious Saul, I ſay, they take the moſt open place of the family before children, ſeruants, and whole houſe, to reproue their wiues; and that with ſuch bitter and diſgracefull termes, as either they prouoke their wiues to anſwer againe for maintaining (as they thinke) their owne credit and reputation, (thus Ionathan 
                  1 Sam. 20. 32. was prouoked to anſwer his father againe:) or elſe giue them of the houſe that behold her thus trampled vnder foot, occaſion to ſet their feet alſo vpon her.
               Moſt husbands are forward enough to reproue, but few doe it in meekneſſe, and moderation. They cannot doe it but in company, nor without bitter words. Many in rebuking their wiues, ſticke not to vſe all the euill termes that they can thinke of, euen ſuch as tend not only to their wiues diſhonour, but alſo to their owne and their childrens infamy. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe they neuer rebuke but when they are in paſſion, and ſo ſcarſe know what they doe: whereby alſo they ſtirre vp paſſion in their wiues, and yet for all that refraine not any whit the more, but rather grow more violent: as when the heat of two fires meet together, the flame muſt needs be the greater. This being the prepoſterous practiſe of many husbands, is it any maruell that ordinarily ſo little good, and ſo much hurt is done by reprouing? Nay, would it not be a wonder, if any good, and no hurt ſhould be done thereby? This therefore though it be a duty, yet a dutie rarely and with great moderation to be vſed.
               Thus farre of an husbands mildneſſe in his ſpeeches to his wife.
            
            
               §. 40. Of an husbands 
                  Treat. 3. §. 10. 
                  amiable countenance towards his wife.
               
               An husbands cariage towards his wife muſt be anſwerable An husbands cariage muſt be milde. to his ſpeech, or elſe all the mildneſſe thereof will ſeeme but complementall.
               
                  
A mans cariage compriſeth vnder it, his Countenance, Geſture, Actions: in all which muſt mildneſſe be ſeated.
               1. His countenance in his wiues preſence, and towards his 1. A milde countenance. wife, muſt be compoſed to an amiable pleaſantneſſe. His authority ouer her, and eminencie aboue her, may not make him forget the neere coniunction and vnion betwixt them.
               Vnder the face and countenance I compriſe head, brow, eies, lips and ſuch other parts which are, according as they are framed, ſignes of amiableneſſe, or diſcontentedneſſe. Now among, and aboue other parts of the body, the outward compoſition of the countenance doth ſooneſt and beſt declare the inward diſpoſition of the heart. By Eſaus pleaſant countenance Iaakob perceiued that he was pacified in his heart towards him, and thereupon ſaid, I haue ſeene thy face as though I had 
                  
                     Gen. 33. 10. 
                  ſeene the face of God, that is, an amiable, gracious countenance. On this ground Dauid deſired God, to lift vp the light of his 
                  
                     Pſal. 4. 6. 
                  countenance vpon him, that thereby he might know the fauour and loue of God towards him. On the other ſide by a frowning and lowring face, by hanging downe the head, putting out the lips, with the like, anger, malice, griefe, with other like affections of heart, are manifeſted: by Caines caſting downe 
                     Gen. 4. 6. of his countenance God diſcerned anger and enuy to be in his heart: by Labans countenance Iaakob obſerued that his affection 
                     Gen. 31. 2. was turned from him. A wife then beholding mildneſſe and amiableneſſe in her husbands face, beholds it as the face of God, and therein as in a looking glaſſe beholds the kindneſſe and loue of his heart, and ſo hath her heart thereby the more firmely knit vnto him, and is moued the more to reſpect him.
            
            
               §. 41. Of husbands too great auſteritie.
               
               Contrary is 1. A loftie proud countenance, as of an imperious Contrary. 1. A lofty brow. Lord ouer his vaſſals.
               2. A grim ſterne countenance, as of a iudge ouer poore priſoners. 2. A grim looke.
               
               3. A lowring frowning countenance, as of a diſcontented 3. A frowning forehead.

                  biect that hath diſpleaſed him.
               
                  
Theſe and ſuch like countenances as they manifeſt a proud, ſtout, furious diſcontented diſpoſition of heart, ſo they cannot but giue great diſcontent to a wife, yea and much affright her being but a weake veſſell, and alienate her heart and affection from him.
            
            
               §. 42. Of an husbands familiar geſture with his wife.
               
               II. An husbands geſture ought to be ſo familiar, and amiable 2. Mild geſlure. towards his wife, as others may diſcerne him to be her husband, and his wife may be prouoked to be familiar with him. They which this way are ready to ſhew themſelues kind and milde husbands, are prone to exceed and ſo to fall into an extreame on the right hand: for ſome are neuer well but when they haue their wiues in their laps, euer colling, kiſſing, and dallying with them, they care not in what company; thus they ſhew more lightneſſe, fondneſſe, and dotage, then true kindneſſe and loue, which forgetteth not an husband-like grauity, ſobriety, modeſty and decency.
               Some ſticke not to alledge Iſaacks ſporting with Rebeckah, to Obiect. countenance their laſciuiouſneſſe. 
                     Gen. 26. 8.
               
               But they forget that what Iſaak did, was when he and his Anſw. wife were alone: he was ſeene through a window. Much greater liberty is granted to man and wife when they are alone, then in company. Beſides there are many other waies to ſhew kindneſſe and familiarity, then by lightneſſe and wantonneſſe.
            
            
               §. 43. Of an husbands ſtrangeneſſe to his wife.
               
               Contrary to the familiaritie I ſpeake of, is (as we ſpeake) ſtrangeneſſe, when an husband ſo carrieth himſelfe towards his wife as if ſhe were a ſtranger to him: if he come in cōpany where his wife is, of all other women he will not turne to her, nor take notice of her. This fault is ſo much the greater if ſuch a man be of a free pleaſant cariage, and vſe to be merry and familiar with other women. Though his mirth and familiarity be ſuch as is not vnbeſeeming a Chriſtian, yet his cariage being of another temper towards his wife, it may be a meanes to breed iealouſie in her. Many thinke outward kinde geſture towards

wife to be fondneſſe, but if they knew what a meanes it is to ſtirre vp, increaſe, and preſerue loue in a wiues heart to her husband, they would be otherwiſe minded.
            
            
               §. 43. Of an husbands giuing fauours to his wife.
               
               III. Actions are of all other the moſt reall demonſtrations of true kindneſſe, wherein an husband muſt not faile, as he would haue his kinde ſpeech, countenance, and geſture to be taken in the better part. Kindneſſe and mildneſſe in action conſiſteth in giuing fauours (as we ſpeake) vnto his wife. This is expreſly noted in Elkanah, who euery yeere gaue fauours to 1 Sam. 1. 4, 5. his wiues. Thus an husband as he teſtifieth his loue to his wife, ſo he will much prouoke her to doe all duty to him. A ſmall gift, as an action of kindneſſe freely giuen, not vpon any debt, but in teſtimony of loue, doth more worke on the heart of her to whom it is giuen, then much more giuen vpon contract, or for a worke done, whereby it may ſeeme to be deſerued.
               In giuing fauours to a wife, an husband ought to be more bountifull and liberall, then to others, that ſo ſhe may ſee thereby he loues her aboue all; as it is noted that Elkanah gaue Annah a worthy portion, becauſe he loued her. And in giuing 1 Sam. 1. 4. fauours it is beſt to beſtow them with his owne hands, vnleſſe he be abſent from her.
            
            
               §. 44. Of husbands beating their wiues.
               
               Contrary are the furious, and ſpightfull actions of many vnkinde husbands (heads too heady) whoſe fauours are buffets, 
                     Vipera virus ob venerationem nuptiarum euomit. Et tu duritiem animi, tuferitatem, tu crudelitatem ob vnionis reuerentiam non deponis? Baſil. Hexaem. hom. 7. Ambr. Hexaem. l. 5. c. 7. vrget hanc ipſam ſimilitudinem.
                   blowes, ſtrokes, & ſtripes: wherein they are worſe then the venemous viper. For the viper for his mates ſake caſteth out his poiſon: and wilt not thou, ô husband, in reſpect of that neere vnion which is betwixt thee and thy wife, lay aſide thy fierceneſſe and cruelty? Many wiues by reaſon of their huſbands furie, are in worſe caſe then ſeruants: for
               1. Such as will not giue a blow to a ſeruant, care not what load they lay vpon their wiues.
               2. Where ſeruants haue but a time and terme to be vnder the tyranny of ſuch furious men, poore wiues are tied to them all their life long.
               
                  
3. Wiues can not haue ſo good remedy by the helpe of law againſt cruell husbands, as ſeruants may haue againſt cruell maſters.
               4. Maſters haue not ſuch opportunity to exerciſe their cruelty ouer ſeruants as husbands ouer wiues, who are to be continually at boord and bed with their husbands.
               5. The neerer wiues are, and the dearer they ought to be to their husbands, the more grieuous muſt ſtroakes needs be when they are giuen by an husbands hand, then by a maſters. 
                     Huiuſmodi virum (ſiquidem vir appellandus eſt potius quàm fera) & patricidae, & matricidae ſimilem dixeris. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11.
               
               6. The leſſe power and authority that an husband hath to ſtrike his wife, then a maſter to ſtrike a ſeruant, the more heauie doe his ſtroakes ſeeme to be, and the worſe doth the caſe of a wife ſeeme to be in that reſpect, then of a ſeruant. Not vnfitly therefore is ſuch a man (if he may be thought a man rather then a beaſt) ſaid to be like a father-queller and mother-queller.
               
                  
                     Queſt. May not then an husband beat his wife? An husband may not beat his wife.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. With ſubmiſſion to better iudgements, I thinke he may not: my reaſons are theſe.
                  1. There is no warrant thorowout the whole Scripture 
                        Reaſons. 1. No warrant in the word. by precept, or example for it: which argument though it be negatiue, yet for the point in hand is a forceable argument in two reſpects. 1. Becauſe the Scripture hath ſo plentifully and particularly declared the ſeuerall duties of husbands and wiues: and yet hath deliuered nothing concerning an huſbands ſtriking and beating his wife. 2. Becauſe it hath alſo plentifully and particularly ſpoaken of all ſuch as are to correct, and of their manner of correcting, and of their bearing correction who are to be corrected, and of the vſe they are to make thereof; and yet not any thing at all concerning an husbands puniſhing, or a wiues bearing in this kinde. The Scripture being ſo ſilent in this point, we may well inferre that God hath not ranked wiues among thoſe in the family who are to be corrected.
                  2. That ſmall diſparity which (as I haue §. 4. before ſhewed) is 2. Small diſparity. betwixt man and wife, permitteth not ſo high a power in an husband, and ſo low a ſeruitude in a wife, as for him to beat her. Can it be thought reaſonable that ſhe who is the mans

perpetuall bed-fellow, who hath power ouer his body, who Summa iniuria eſt vitae ſociam, & in rebus neceſſarijs tibi coniunctam, taquàm mancipium ignominia affioere. Chryſ. ibid. is a ioynt parent of the children, a ioynt gouernour of the family, ſhould be beaten by his hands? What if children or ſeruants ſhould know of it? (as they muſt needs: for how can ſuch a thing be done in the houſe and they of the houſe know it not?) can they reſpect her as a mother, or a miſtreſſe who is vnder correction as well as they?
                  3. The neere coniunction, and very vnion that is betwixt 3. Neere coniunction. man and wife ſuffereth not ſuch dealing to paſſe betwixt them. The wife is as a mans ſelfe, 
                        Eph. 5. 31. 
                     They two are one fleſh. No man but a frantike, furious, deſperat wretch will beat himſelfe. Two ſorts of men are in Scripture noted to cut and lanch their owne fleſh, idolaters, as the 1 King. 18. 28. Baalites, and Daemoniacks, as 
                        Mar. 5. 5. he that was poſſeſſed with a legion of deuils. Such are they who beat their wiues, either blinded in their vnderſtanding, or poſſeſſed with a deuill.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. He that is beſt in his wits will ſuffer his body to be pinched, pricked, lanched, and otherwiſe pained, if it be needfull and behoofull.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. A mans heart will not ſuffer him to doe any of theſe himſelfe: their are Chirurgions whoſe office it is to doe ſuch things: if the Chirurgion himſelfe haue need of any ſuch remedy for his owne body, he will vſe the helpe of another Chirurgion. If the caſe ſo ſtand as a wife muſt needs be beaten, it is fitter for an husband to referre the matter to a publike Magiſtrate (who is as an approued and licenſed Chirurgion) and not to doe it with his owne hands.
                  2. Though ſome parts of the body may be ſo dealt withall, yet euery part may not, as the heart, which the wife is to the man.
                  3. The compariſon holdeth not. For the fore-named pinching, lanching, &c. is no puniſhment for any fault, as the beating of a wife in queſtion is, there is no queſtion but a man that hath skill may if need be open a veine, lanch a boile, ſplinter a broken bone, or diſioynted ioynt in his wiues body, which may be more painfull then correction: and herein the compariſon holdeth, but not in the other.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. There is as neere a coniunction betwixt Chriſt

and his Church, as betwixt man and wife: yet Chriſt for beareth not to correct and puniſh his Church.
                  
                     Anſw. There is a double relation betwixt Chriſt and the Church: he is an husband vnto it, hauing made it of his fleſh, and of his bones: and a ſupreme Lord ouer it, hauing all power 
                     
                        Eph. 5. 30. Mat. 28. 18. 
                     in heauen and earth committed vnto him. In this latter reſpect he puniſheth, not in the former. An husband is not ſuch a ſupreme Lord ouer his wife: therefore Chriſts example, is no warrant to him.
                  4. There is no hope of any good to proceed from an huſbands 4. No profit: much miſchiefe. beating of his wife: for where the party corrected is perſwaded that the party which correcteth hath no authority or right ſo to doe, it will not be brought patiently to take it: but will reſiſt, and ſtriue if it be poſſible to get the maſtery. Let a ſtranger ſtrike ſuch a childe of yeeres or a ſeruant as will patiently beare many ſtroakes at a parents or maſters hand, they will turne againe at that ſtranger, and indeauour to giue him as good as he brings: now a wife hauing no ground to be perſwaded that her husband hath authority to 
                        Adhibitis verberibus morbus non tollitur, ſed augetur, & exaſperatur. Melch. Iun. quaeſt. Polit. par. 2. beat her, what hope is there that ſhe will patiently beare it, and be bettered by it? Or rather is it not likely that ſhe will, if ſhe can, riſe againſt him, ouer-maſter him (as many doe) and neuer doe any duty aright? A fault in a wife is not taken away but increaſed by blowes.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Smart and paine may make her dread her husband, ſtand in awe of him, and doe her duty the better.
                  
                     Anſw. Such dread and awe beſeemes neither the place of an husband to exact it, nor the place of a wife to yeeld it. Though perforce ſhe may be brought to yeeld ſome outward ſubiection, yet inward hatred of her husbands perſon may be ioyned therewith, which is as bad, if not worſe then outward diſobedience.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. She may be of ſo outragious a diſpoſition, as, but by 
                        Nullum ſit tam magnum peccatum, quod ad verberandum vxorem compellat. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. force, ſhe will not be kept in any compaſſe.
                  1. Anſw. It hath beene of old time anſwered, that no fault ſhould be ſo great, as to compell an husband to beat his wife.
                  
                  2. Anſw. Other forceable meanes may be vſed beſides beating by her husbands hands: ſhe may be reſtrained of libertie, denied ſuch things as ſhe moſt affecteth, be kept vp, as it were, in hold;

and, if no other meanes will ſerue the turne, be put ouer to the Magiſtrates hands, that if ſhe be of ſo ſeruile a diſpoſition, as by no other meanes ſhe will be kept vnder then by feare and force, by ſmart and paine, ſhe may feare the Magiſtrate, and feele his hand, rather then her husbands.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. If a wife waxe ſo manniſh, or rather mad, as to offer to ſtrike and beat her husband, may he not in that caſe beat her to make her ceaſe her outrage?
                  
                     Anſw. I doubt not but that that good prouiſion which is made in law to preſerue a mans life, may be applied to this purpoſe. The law ſimply condemnes all murther; yet if a man be ſo aſſaulted, as there is no way to preſerue his owne life, but by taking away his life that aſſaults him, it condemneth not him as a murtherer, becauſe he did it in defence of himſelfe. So if an huſband Sedefendendo. be ſet vpon by his wife, it is lawfull and expedient that he defend himſelfe, and if he can doe it no other wayes but by ſtriking her, that is not to be reckoned an vnlawfull beating her.
               
            
            
               §. 45. Of an husbands bearing with his wines infirmities.
               
               Hither to of the husbands auoiding of offence, a word concerning his bearing with offence.
               A generall dutie it is, common to all of all ſorts, to beare one 
                  
                     Gal. 6. 2. 
                  anothers burden: in which extent euen a wife is to beare her huſbands burden, becauſe he, as euery one elſe, is ſubiect to ſlip and fall, and ſo hath need to be ſupported. Yet after a more ſpeciall and peculiar manner doth this dutie belong to an husband, and that in two reſpects.
               1. Of the two, he is more bound then his wife, becauſe in relation to his wife he is the ſtronger: for ſhe is the weaker veſſell, 
                  
                     Conſidera mulierem debile vas eſſe: tu autem vir propterea princeps factus es, vt ſubditae feras imbecillitatem. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. 1. Pet. 3. 7. But the ſtrong are moſt bound to beare with the infirmities of the weake, Rom. 15. 1.
               2. He is bound to beare with his wife more then with any other, becauſe of that neere coniunction which is betwixt them: he that cannot beare with his wife, his fleſh, can beare with no bodie. The reaſon alleaged by the Apoſtle to moue a man to dwell with his wife according to knowledge, and to giue honour to her, intimated in this phraſe, as to the weaker veſſell, ſheweth that this is a peculiar dutie belonging to an husband, wherein, and whereby he 1. Pet. 3. 7.
                  
may both manifeſt his knowledge and wiſdome, and alſo doe honour to his wife. For why is he put in minde of her weakneſſe, but to ſhew he ſhould beare with her?
               As that phraſe intimateth the dutie, ſo alſo it intimateth a good reaſon to inforce it. For pretious things, whereof we make high account, the weaker they be, the more tenderly, and charily are they handled, as Cheney diſhes, and chriſtall glaſſes: and of all parts of the bodie, the eye is moſt tenderly handled. Now what things, what perſons are more deare and pretious then a wife? yet withall ſhe is a weake veſſell: therefore ſhe is much to be borne withall.
               For an husbands better direction herein, difference muſt be Directions to husbands for bearing with their wiues infirmities. made betwixt infirmities: for ſome are naturall imperfections, other are actuall tranſgreſſions. Naturall imperfections are inward, (as ſlowneſſe in conceit, dulneſſe in apprehenſion, ſhortneſſe of memorie, haſtineſſe in paſſion, &c.) or outward, (as lameneſſe, blindneſſe, deafneſſe, or any other defect, and deformitie of bodie.) Theſe infirmities ſhould breed pitie, compaſſion, commiſeration, yea and greater tenderneſſe and reſpect, but no offence. Note Abrahams example in this caſe: his wife was barren, yet he deſpiſed Neque Saram tanquam ſterilem contempſit Abraham: n

               Actuall tranſgreſſions are breaches of Gods law: whereof ſuch are here ment, as are moſt directly tending to his owne diſquiet, and diſaduantage, as ſhrewiſhneſſe, waiwardneſſe, niceneſſe, ſtubbornneſſe, &c. In the bearing of theſe muſt an husband eſpecially ſhew his wiſdome, and that ſundry wayes.
               1. By vſing the beſt and mildeſt meanes he can to redreſſe them, as meeke admonition, ſeaſonable aduice, gentle intreatie, and compaſſionate affection. Elkanah ſuppoſing that his wife offended in her paſſion, thus dealt with her and ſupported her.
               2. By remouing the ſtone whereat ſhe ſtumbleth, by taking away the occaſion (ſo far as conueniently he can) which maketh her offend. Thus Abram, and that by Gods aduice, put Hagar and her ſonne out of the houſe, becauſe they were an offence to Sarah.
               
               3. By turning his eyes away (if the matter be not great, but 1 Sam. 1. 8. Gen. 21. 14. ſuch as may be tolerated) and taking no notice of the offence, but rather paſſing by it, as if he perceiued it not. Solomon ſaith, that

                  it is a mans glory to paſſe ouer a tranſgreſſion: and he exhorteth a 
                     Prou. 19. 11. Eccl 7. 23. man not to giue his heart to all the words that men ſpeake.
               
               4. By forgiuing and forgetting it (if notice be taken thereof.) Iaakob tooke notice of Rachels raſh, and froward demand, for he 
                     Gen. 30. 1. 2, &c.
                   rebuked her for it: yet in that he readily yeelded to that which afterwards ſhe moued him vnto, it appeareth that he forgaue the offence, if not forgat it.
               The beſt triall of a mans affection to his wife, and of his wiſdome Reaſon. Beſt tryall of a mans wiſdome & loue. in ordering the ſame, is in this point of bearing with offences. Not to be offended with a wife that giueth no offence is not praiſe-worthy: heathen men may goe ſo farre. Note what Chriſt ſaith of this caſe, If yee loue them which loue you, and doe good to 
                  
                     Matth. 5. 46. Luk. 6. 32, 33. 
                  them that doe good to you, what thanks and reward haue ye? for publicans, and ſinners doe the ſame: but gently to forbeare, and wiſely to paſſe ouer offences when they are giuen, not to be prouoked when there is cauſe of prouocation miniſtred, is a true Chriſtian vertue, a vertue beſeeming husbands better then any other kinde of men.
            
            
               §. 46. Of husbands teſtineſſe.
               
               Contrary is teſtineſſe, and peeuiſhneſſe, when husbands are moued with the leaſt prouocation, like tinder catching fire at the leaſt ſparke that falleth vpon it: yea many are like gunpowder, which not only taketh fire, but alſo breaketh out into a violent flame, vpon the leaſt touch of fire: as gunpowder is dangerous to be kept in an houſe, ſo ſuch husbands to be ioyned ſo neerely to wiues as mariage ioyneth them. If it be ſaid, that as gunpowder doth no hurt, if fire come not at it; ſo they are good and kinde, if they be not prouoked and diſpleaſed. I anſwer, that we haue a prouerbe that ſaith, The deuill is good while he is pleaſed, yet it is not ſafe to haue the deuill too neere. It is as impoſſible (conſidering mans weakneſſe) that he ſhould liue and conuerſe with any, and not giue offence, as for flint ſtones long to beat and daſh againſt one another, & no ſparke of fire to come from them. How then may it be thought poſſible for a wife, who is ſo continually conuerſant with her husband, and the weaker veſſell, to liue without giuing him offence? It is no very kinde ſpeech, which huſbands vſe, eſpecially if they be told of their vnkindneſſe, Let my wife deſerue fauour, and ſhe ſhall haue it. How little fauour would

ſuch husbands haue of Chriſt their husband, if he ſhould be of that minde towards them?
               Thus farre hath beene handled the firſt part of an husbands well managing his authoritie, by a tender reſpect of his wife.
               The ſecond is a prouident care for her.
            
            
               §. 46. Of an husbands prouident care for his wife.
               
               An husband that tenderly reſpecteth his wife, but prouidently careth not for her, ſheweth more affection then diſcretion: he may haue a kinde heart, but he wants a wiſe head. How then can he be a good head vnto his wife? Some preſent contentment ſhe may haue by him: but ſmall profit and benefit can ſhe reape from him. Thoſe duties therefore which haue beene deliuered muſt be done, but theſe that follow muſt by no meanes be left vndone.
               An husbands prouident care is noted in that office of Chriſt, wherein an husband reſembleth him, namely, to be a Sauiour of 
                  
                     Eph. 5. 23. 
                  the bodie, as hath beene Treat. 1. §. 15. & Treat. 3. §. 73. before declared. It conſiſteth

                     2. In protecting her from things hurtfull.
                  
               
               1. A carefull prouiding of things needfull, is a principall part of 1. Prouiding things needfull. that honour, which husbands are to giue vnto their wiues. For where the Apoſtle ſaith, that Elders are worthy of double honour, 
                  1 Pet. 3. 7. 1 Tim. 5. 17. he meaneth maintenance as well as reuerence. The Apoſtle counteth him worſe then an Infidell, that prouideth not for his owne, and ſpecially for thoſe of his owne houſe. Who are of an husbands houſe, 1 Tim. 5. 8. if not his wife? in his houſe, who more properly his owne, then his wife? If then an husband prouide not for his wife, what is he 
                     Recordare quòd pater vxoris tā
                        quam depoſitum quoddam filiam tibi tradidit, & omnibus relictis, matre, domo, & ſeipſo, omnem eius curā tuae dexterae commiſit. Chryſ. hō. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. to be accounted?
               Great reaſon he ſhould prouide for her, becauſe he hath taken her from her parents and friends, and hath receiued that portion which they allotted her, and hath authoritie committed vnto him ouer her, and ſhe is put in ſubiection vnder him: her friends hauing giuen away her portion, and their power ouer her, and committed all to him, will take no further care for her: ſhe being in ſubiection vnder him cannot without him prouide for her ſelfe. Who then ſhall prouide for her if he doe not, whoſe wholy and only ſhe is?
               
                  
Contrary is their minde, who take a wife only for their owne Contrary, to take a wife only for himſelfe. content, or delight, or gaine, and neuer thinke of that charge which together with a wife they take vpon them. According to their minde is their practiſe: for when they haue a wife they neglect her in euery thing but what may ſtand with their owne ends. Much haue they to anſwer for: and ſo much the more, becauſe a wife is an eſpeciall pledge of Gods fauour.

               For her Soule, meanes of ſpirituall edification muſt be provided, and thoſe both priuate and publike. Priuate meanes, are Priuate means of edification. holy and religious exerciſes in the houſe, as reading the word, praier, catechiſing, and ſuch like; which being the ſpirituall food of the ſoule are to be euery day, as our bodily food, prouided and vſed. An husband as a maſter of a family muſt provide theſe for the good of his whole houſe; but as an husband, in ſpeciall for the good of his wife: for to his wife, as well as to the whole houſe he is a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet.
               By himſelfe therefore, for his wiues good, ought he to performe theſe things, or to prouide that they may be done by ſome other. C
                        •
                     raelius himſelfe performed thoſe exerciſes. 
                     Act. 10. 2, 30. Iudg. 17. 10. 
                  Micah hired a Leuite (though his Idolatry were euill, yet his care to haue a Leuite in his houſe was commendable.) The 2 King. 4. 11. Shunemites husband prouided a chamber for the Prophet, and that eſpecially for his wiues ſake, for it was at her requeſt.
               Publike meanes are the holy ordinances of God publikly Publike meanes of edification. performed by Gods Miniſter. The care of an husband for his wife in this reſpect is, ſo to order his habitation, and prouide other needfull things, as his wife may be made partaker thereof. It is expreſly noted of Elkanah that he ſo prouided for his 1 Sam. 1. 7. & 2. 19. Luk. 2. 41. wiues, that they went with him euery yeere to the houſe of God: the like is intimated of Ioſeph the husband of the virgin

                  Mary. In thoſe daies there was a publike place and houſe of God, whither all Gods people (how farre ſoeuer they dwelt from it) were to reſort euery yeere: the places where Elkanah and Ioſeph dwelt, were farre remote from the houſe of God, yet they ſo prouided, as not only themſelues, but their wiues alſo went to the publike worſhip of God. Now there are many houſes of God, places for the publike worſhip of God, but yet through the corruption of our times, the miniſtery of the word (the moſt principall meanes of ſpirituall edification) is not euery where to be enioyed: therefore ſuch ought an huſbands care for his wife in this reſpect to be, as to dwell where ſhe may haue the benefit of preaching the word, or elſe ſo to prouide for her, as ſhe may weekly goe where it may be had.
               If men of wiſdome and abilitie make a purchaſe, or build an houſe for their habitation, they will be ſure it ſhall be where ſweet riuers and waters are, and good paſture ground, and where all needfull prouiſion may be had. Gods word preached is a ſpring of water of life; the place where it is preached a pleaſant, profitable paſture; all needfull prouiſion for the ſoule may there be had. Let this therefore be moſt of all inquired after: and no habitation ſetled but where this may be had.
            
            
               §. 48. Of neglecting their wiues edification.
               
               Contrary is their practiſe, who hauing their calling in places where the word is plentifull, yet vpon outward reſpects of pleaſure, delight, eaſe, and profit, remoue their families into remote places where preaching is ſcarce, if at all; and there leaue their wiues to gouerne the family, not regarding their want of the word, for as much as they themſelues oft comming to London or other like places by reaſon of their calling, enioy the word themſelues. Many Citizens, Lawyers, and others are guiltie of great neglect of their wiues in this reſpect.
               So alſo are they, who abandon all religious exerciſes out of their houſes, making their houſes rather ſtewes of the deuill, then Churches of God. If for want of meanes, either publike or priuate, a wife liue and die in ignorance, profaneneſſe, infidelitie, and impenitencie, which cauſe eternall damnation,

aſſuredly her bloud ſhall be required at his hands: for an huſband

               §. 49. Of an husbands prouiding things needfull for his wiues boay.
               
               To the body alſo muſt an husbands prouident care of his wife extend: and that both in health and ſickneſſe. In health by prouiding ſuch things as are needfull to preſerue health, as competent food, raiment, and the like neceſſaries. Where the 
                     Jſa. 4. 1. Prophet to aggrauate the miſery of the people ſaith, Seuen women ſhall take hold of one man, ſaying, We will eat our owne bread, and weare our owne apparell, only let vs be called by thy name, intimateth, that it was an husbands dutie to prouide bread and apparell, that is, all neceſſaries for his wife. Which the 
                     Exo. 21. 10. law alſo implieth, where it inioyneth him that taketh one wife vpon another, not to diminiſh the food and raiment of the former. In ſickneſſe ſuch things are to be prouided as are needfull either to recouer her health, or to comfort, cheriſh and refreſh her in her ſickneſſe.
               This was Treat. 2. Part. 2. §. 29. before noted among common mutuall duties; for by vertue of the matrimoniall bond it belongeth both to man and wife: but to the man it appertaineth by vertue of that power and charge which he hath ouer his wife: and therefore it was needfull here to be touched.

                  Treat. 3. §. 49. 
                  prouident care for his wife about her child-bearing.
               
               Moſt proper to this place is that prouident care which huſbands ought to haue of their wiues both before and in the time of their trauell and child-bed: and that in two things eſpecially.
               1. In procuring for their wiues to the vttermoſt of their power and abilitie, ſuch things as may ſaue their longing, in caſe they doe long (as in all ages women in the time of breeding and bearing childe, haue beene ſubiect thereunto.) For it is well knowne, that it is very dangerous both for mother and childe to want her longing: the death ſometimes of the one, ſometimes of the other, ſometimes of both hath followed thereupon.
               2. In prouiding ſuch things as are needfull for their trauell

and lying in childbed. This time is eſpecially to be prouided for, in many reſpects.
               1. Becauſe it is a time of weakneſſe, wherein the woman cannot well prouide for her ſelfe.
               2. Becauſe her weakneſſe is ioyned with much paine: the The paines of womens trauell. paine of a women in trauell is the greateſt paine that ordinarily is endured by any for the time: none know it ſo well as they that feele it: and many husbands becauſe they are not ſubiect thereto, thinke but lightly of it: but if we duly weigh 
                     Pſal. 48 6. Iſa. 13. 8. & 21. 3 Ier. 4. 31. & 30. 6. Mic. 49. that the holy Ghoſt when he would ſet forth the extremitie of any paines and pangs, reſembleth them to the paines of a woman in trauell, we may well gather, that of all they are the greateſt: which is further manifeſted by the ſcreekes and outcries which not only weake, and faint-hearted women vtter in the time of their trauell, but alſo are forced from the ſtrongeſt, and ſtouteſt women that be, and that though before hand they reſolue to the contrary. Neither may we wonder thereat; for their body is as it were ſet on a racke (if at leaſt the trauell be ſharpe) and all their parts ſo ſtretched, as a wonder it is they ſhould euer recouer their health and ſtrength againe: or that they ſhould hold out the brunt, and not die with their trauell, as Rachel, and the wife of Phinchas, and many in all ages haue 
                     Gen. 35. 16, &c. 1 Sam. 4. 19. 20. done. Surely among ordinary deliuerances I know none ſo neere a miracle, none wherein the Almighty doth ſo euidently manifeſt his great power and good prouidence, as in the ſafe deliuerie of women. Beſides the great pang of trauell, women are alſo after their deliuerie ſubiect to many after-throws which are very painfull. From all theſe paines and great weakneſſe which befalleth women in childbed, eſpecially if they nurſe their children, men by reaſon of their ſex are freed: Now then to apply this point, ſeeing women are brought to ſuch paines and weakneſſe in bringing forth thoſe children which are the mans as well as hers, and he freed from all; is it not very iuſt and meet that he ſhould prouide all things needfull for her welfare, eaſe, and recouery of ſtrength?
               3. Becauſe the want of things needfull is at that time very dangerous: dangerous to the health and life of the woman and childe alſo.
            
            
               
               §. 51. Of neglecting wiues in their weakneſſe.
               
               Contrary to an husbands prouident care in generall are thoſe vices which were taxed in the treatiſe of common duties, * See Treat 2. Part. 2. § 30. 39. as grudging at the charges beſtowed on a wife: Couetouſneſſe, Prodigality, and Idleneſſe.
               
               But contrary in particular to an husbands care for his wife in childbed, is the inhumane and more then barbarous vnkindneſſe of many husbands, who no whit conſider the weakneſſe of their wiues in this caſe, to helpe, eaſe, and comfort them, but rather make their burden much more heauy. For,
               1. Some through couetouſneſſe refuſe before hand to afford meanes to their wife to prouide ſuch things as are needfull for her ſelfe and child: & when the time commeth, if their wife be deſirous of a Midwife that requireth ſomwhat more charges then ſhe that is next, ſhe ſhall haue none if ſhe will not haue the next. And as for a nurſe to tend her, they thinke their Maid will ſerue the turne wel enough: they need not be at the charges to bring a Nurſe into the houſe. In regard of conuenient lodging ſome will not ſticke to ſay, Cannot my wife be brought to bed in a roome without a chimney as well as the Virgin Mary? Why ſhould my wife need more things then ſhe did? Yea further there be many that whē the time that their wife ſhould be deliuered approacheth neere, carie her from al her friends into a place where ſhe is not knowne, leſt her friends ſhould by importunity draw him to expend and lay out more vpon his wife then he is willing. In the time while their wife is weake in childbed, many are loath to allow them any other diet then is for themſelues and children prouided in the houſe, not conſidering that her ſtomach cannot be like theirs.
               Many other ſuch bitter fruits of vnkinde husbands ariſing from couetouſneſſe might be reckoned vp, whereby husbands plainely ſhew that they loue their wealth better then their wiues: they had rather loſe them, then part with that.
               
               2. Others through iealous ſuſpicion forbeare not euen in

Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. the time of their wiues paine and weakneſſe, to vpbraid them with lightneſſe, and to ſay that the childe is none of theirs. To lay this to a wiues charge vniuſtly, is at any time a moſt ſhamefull and odious reproach: but in the time of childebirth

whether iuſt or vniuſt, a thing too too ſpightfull and reuengefull. Some wiues are ſo farre ouercome thereby, (eſpecially in the time of their weakneſſe) as they are not able to beare it, but euen faint and die vnder the reproach: others more ſtout vow neuer to know their husbands againe. Many like miſchiefes follow on ſuch vnkindneſſe.

               The meaſure muſt extend to his ability: for an husband ought to maintaine his wife in as good an eſtate and faſhion as himſelfe; by mariage ſhe is aduanced to as high an eſtate, and dignity in relation to others as he is: and for her owne vſe ſhe is made a partner of all his goods, and accordingly ought to partake thereof.
               For the manner, he muſt ſuffer her (if at leaſt he obſerue her to haue any competent diſcretion) to order ſuch things as are needfull for her ſelfe according to her beſt liking: as Elkanah in another caſe ſaid to his wife, Doe what ſeemeth thee beſt. 
                  1 Sam. 1. 23.
               
               Both in the meaſure and in the manner of prouiding, there muſt be a difference put betwixt a wife, and ſeruants or children. Theſe may haue their portions of meat, apparrell, and like neceſſaries, proportioned out and ſtinted vnto them, which is vnmeet to be done to a wife. Neither is it needfull that ſo plentifull a prouiſion be made for them as for her.
            
            
               §. 53. Of an husbands nigardlyneſſe to his wife.
               
               Contrary is an husbands nigardly dealing with his wife: when the allowance ſhe hath is both farre vnder his eſtate, and alſo ſo giuen her by little and little, as if ſhe were a childe. Many husbands make their wiues drudge at home, fare hardly, and goe meanly; who are themſelues braue in apparrell, frolicke in their feaſting abroad, and ſo exceed their wiues as they are aſhamed to be ſeene in company with them. They who marry their maids, or others of meaner ranke then themſelues, oft ſo deale with them: eſteeming them but as ſeruants and meane perſons though they be their wiues. But it hath beene §. 6. before ſhewed, that wiues by marriage are aduanced to their

husbands dignity, how meane ſoeuer they were before.
            
            
               §. 54. Of husbands 
                  Treat. 3. §. 23. 29. 33. 
                  allowing their wiues to beſtow on others, as they ſee good occaſion.
               
               So farre ought the prouident care of an husband for his wife to extend, as ſhe may haue (beſide things needfull to her ſelfe) to beſtow on ſuch as it is requiſite for her to giue vnto: as namely, on children and ſeruants in the houſe, and others alſo out of the houſe. For ſo much is noted in Salomons deſcription 
                     Pro. 31. 15. &c. Verſ. 21. Uerſ. 28. of a good wife; She giueth meat to her houſhold, and a portion to her maidens: all her houſhold is clothed with ſcarlet (namely, by her ordering and diſpoſing the matter.) Her children riſe vp and call her bleſſed, as for her generall cariage in the family, ſo for her particular fauours beſtowed on themſelues. As for 
                     Verſ. 20. others out of the houſe, it is alſo noted, that ſhe ſtretcheth out her hand to the poore, and reacheth forth her hands to the needie. Theſe things ſhe did by virtue of that power and liberty which her husband gaue her: as appeareth by two points there noted:
               1. In that before any mention is made of thoſe things 
                     Verſ. 11. which ſhe did, it is ſaid, The heart of her husband doth ſafely truſt in her.
               
               2. In that, after all her good deedes are reckoned vp, it is 
                     Uerſ. 28. ſaid, Her husband praiſeth her.
               
               After this patterne it is meete that other husbands (whoſe wiues are wiſe and faithfull) ſhould deale with their wiues: that in the houſe they might haue the more honour of children and ſeruants: and that out of the houſe they might giue the better tryall of their charity.
               For conſidering the many excellent promiſes that are made to workes of mercy and charity, and the many terrible threatnings that are denounced not onely againſt ſuch as exerciſe cruelty, but alſo againſt ſuch as ſhew no mercy: conſidering alſo that wiues together with their husbands, are heires of the 
                  1 Pet. 3. 7. 
                  grace of life, it is very needfull yea euen neceſſary, that they ſhould manifeſt their faith by ſome worke of mercy and charity. Now vnleſſe her husband doe giue vnto her ſomething at her owne diſcretion to beſtow on others, true and through

try all of her mercifull and charitable minde cannot be made. If ſhe giue of that which her husband hath reſerued to himſelfe, as her giuing is vnlawfull, ſo ſhe may be thought liberall, not becauſe ſhe is mercifull, but becauſe notwithſtanding her liberality ſhe parteth with nothing of her owne: yea though ſhe haue a generall conſent to giue as ſhe ſeeth cauſe of the common goods of the family, yet is not that ſo ſure and ſound a tryall of her charity, and mercifulneſſe, as if ſhe had ſomething of her owne which ſhe might retaine or giue away as pleaſeth her ſelfe; and what ſhe giues not away, lay vp as her owne ſtocke proper to her ſelfe. For there is naturally ſuch a ſelfe loue in man, and a deſire to keepe that which is proper to ones ſelfe, that he is very loath to part with any of it, vnleſſe conſcience and grace alter this corruption of nature, and ſo moue him readily to lay out ſomething on charitable vſes. But otherwiſe of that which in whole or in part belongeth to another (be that other, husband, parent, maſter, friend, or any elſe) he is eaſily moued to be liberall and bountifull: a man will willingly cut a large thong (as we ſpeake) out of anothers leather.
               It is knowne that many children and ſeruants, who, when they come to be poſſeſſers of their owne, are very niggards and miſers, haue beene liberall of their parents and maſters goods vnto the poore. Yea parteners in a ſtocke will be much more forward in giuing away that which is common with another, then that which is proper to each of them. The trueſt triall of a mercifull and charitable heart lieth in the diſtribution of that which is proper to ones ſelfe.
               It is therefore meet vpon this very ground, that an husband ſhould according to his ability let his wife haue ſome ſtocke, and portion of her owne, free to her ſelfe to diſpoſe as ſhe ſeeth good: intimating vnto her that the principall end why he prouideth ſo plentifully for her, is, that ſhe may ſhew forth the fruits of her faith by ſome workes of charity: and exhorting her ſo to doe. Many religious, wiſe, kinde husbands thus doe: ſome giuing quarterly allowance in money to their wiues, others giuing their wiues power to receiue a certaine portion of rent out of certaine lands or houſes; others making

their wiues an abſolute eſtate of ſome inheritance, and ſuffering them to receiue the profits and reuenewes thereof; others giuing them certaine fees of their offices, or of their trade; others, that are poore, ſuffering them to worke for themſelues, & diſpoſe their earnings as they ſee cauſe: ſome one way, ſome another: euery one in his place beſt knoweth the meanes how to gratifie his wife in this kinde: it ſhall be ſufficient for me to haue laide downe the generall rule.
            
            
               §. 55. Of husbands too great ſtraitneſſe ouer their wiues.
               
               Contrary is their ſtrait-handedneſſe to their wiues, who allow them no more then may be for their owne priuat vſe. They thinke it a great matter and as much as an husband is bound to doe, to let her haue apparrell, meat and drinke, and ſuch neceſſaries as are befitting her ranke, but all other ouerplus they thinke needleſſe. Thus their wiues are not only depriued of meanes to gaine reſpect of their children and ſeruants at home, and to gratifie ſuch as are obedient and ready to doe ſeruice to them, but alſo to performe ſuch workes of mercie as both opportunity requireth, and alſo their conſcience moueth them to doe. Yea many wiues of rich huſbands are brought to great ſhame hereby, in that being in places where there is iuſt occaſion of contributing to ſome charitable vſe, and by reaſon of their rich and coſtly apparell it is expected they ſhould be bountiful, they haue not any thing at all to beſtow. The fault of ſome husbands in this reſpect is great many waies. As 1. in that they bring ſhame and griefe to their wiues, whom they ought with all tenderneſſe to reſpect. 2. In that they diſhonour their owne places: for they who take notice of this ſtraitneſſe to their wiues, will be ready to iudge them both couetous, and vnkinde. 3. The omitting of that worke of mercie which their wiues ſhould haue done ſhall be laid to their charge: they ſhall heare that dreadfull doome; Goe yee curſed into euerlaſting fire, for I was an hungred and yee fed me not &c. and if they anſwer, When ſaw we thee an hungred &c. it ſhall be replied, In that yee ſuffered not your wiues to doe it, you did it not.
               
               Thus much of the extent of an husbands prouident care

for the good of his wife. It followeth to ſpeake of the continuance thereof.
            
            
               §. 57. Of an husbands care to prouide for his wife ſo long as ſhe ſhall liue.
               
               The continuance of an husbands prouident care for his wife muſt be ſo long as ſhe liueth, yea though ſhe out-liue him: not that he can actually when he is dead prouide for her, but that he may before his death ſo prouide for her, as ſhe may haue wherewithall to maintaine her ſelfe, and to liue according to that place whereunto by him ſhe is aduanced: at leaſt that he leaue her not only ſo much as he had with her, but ſomething more alſo in teſtimony of his loue to her, and care for her. Husbands haue the example of Chriſt to preſſe this duty vpon them: for when he went away from his Church here on 
                     Eph 4. 8. earth, he left his ſpirit, which furniſhed it with gifts as plentifully, as if Chriſt had ſtill remained with her, if not more aboundantly.
               For the better performance of this duty, husbands which die before the wiues, muſt obſerue among other things two eſpecially.
               1. That plainly and expreſly they declare their minde and Husbands before they die muſt make their will euen for their wiues good. will before they die, leſt their wiues ſhould be circumuented and defrauded of that which they intended them. Thus did Dauid vpon the motion of Bathſhebah, he ſetled his eſtate, and cauſed Bathſhebahs ſonne to be actually crowned before he himſelfe gaue vp the Ghoſt: which he did, as for other weighty reaſons, ſo in particular for his wiues good, as may be gathered from that reaſon ſhe alleaged to the King in theſe 1 King. 1. 21. Husbands on their deathbed muſt commend their wiues to ſome faithfull friend. Iob. 19 26, 27. Reaſon. Trueſt triall of loue at departure. words; Elſe when my Lord the King ſhall ſleepe-with his fathers, I ſhall be reputed vile.
               
               2. That he requeſt ſome faithfull friend in his ſteed to be an helper vnto her; (as Chriſt commended his mother vnto his diſciple Iohn) which will be needfull in regard of her weakneſſe, by reaſon of her ſex, and want of experience to manage ſuch affaires eſpecially as are out of the houſe.
               At the time of a mans departure out of this world from his wife, will the trueſt triall of his affection to his wife be giuen: for many that beare their wiues faire in hand while they liue

with them, at their death ſhew that there was no ſoundneſſe of affection in their heart towards them: all was but a meere ſhew for ſome by-reſpects.
            
            
               §. 58. Of husbands neglect of their wiues future eſtate.
               
               Contrary are diuers practiſes of vnkinde husbands. For Contrary. 1. A wilfull inability.
               
               1. Some through improuidence, vnthriftineſſe and prodigality, diſable themſelues from doing good to their wiues after their death; and ſo leaue their wiues nothing, or (that which is worſe then nothing) in debt, and with a great charge of children. That care which husbands ought to haue of their wiues ſhould make them thinke before hand of the time to come, and euen for their wiues ſake be ſome-what the more diligent, thrifty, and prouident, and cut off many vnneceſſary expences, elſe their ſinne is doubled. 1. By a needleſſe waſting their eſtate. 2. By neglecting their wiues.
               2. Others by fawning, or forcing meanes draw their wiues 2 Making away their wiues ioynter, or any other right. to yeeld vp that intereſt they haue in money, goods, houſe or land by ioynter, inheritance, or any other way, and yet make them no ſufficient recompence in another kinde: but at their death leaue their wiues in a farre worſe eſtate then they were in before mariage, beſide a greater charge then they had before. As this is a great part of vnkindneſſe, ſo alſo a maine point of iniuſtice.
               3. Others grudging againſt the lawes vnder which they 3. Defeating of thirds.

               §. 58. Of an husbands protecting his wife from danger.
               
               Hauing ſhewed how an husband is to prouide things needfull for his wife: It remaineth to ſhew how he is to protect her from things hurtfull.
               In regard of that protection which an husband oweth his wife, he is called the veile of her eies: which phraſe as it implieth 
                     Gen. 20 16. 
                  Subiection on the wiues part, ſo alſo Protection on the huſbands: to protect one, is as it were, to couer them, namely, from danger; to be negligent and careleſſe of them, is, as it were, to lay them open to danger. The ſame duty is implied vnder another like phraſe of ſpreading his wing ouer his wife. 
                     Ruth 3. 9. The metaphor is taken from winged fowles, which to keepe their young ones from hurt, vſe to ſpread their wings ouer them: this phraſe and metaphor is alſo attributed to God, to 
                     Ruth 2. 12. ſet forth his protection.
               But moſt pertinent to this purpoſe is the title, Treat. 1. §. 15. and treat. 3. §. 73. 
                  Saniour, giuen to an husband in relation to his wife.
               For this end the Lord who ſubiected a woman vnto her husband, gaue to his ſexe greater ſtrength, courage and boldneſſe then to hers, that he might protect her which is the weaker veſſell. In this duty of protection Chriſt ſheweth himſelfe an excellent patterne and preſident vnto husbands.
               The better to performe this dutie, an husband muſt bee carefull,
               1. To preuent, as much as he may, ſuch dangers as his wiſe is like to fall into.
               2. To recouer her out of ſuch as ſhe is fallen into.
               For this purpoſe did Dauid carry his wiues into Gath, leſt, if 1 Sam. 27. 3. they were left in Iſrael, Saul ſhould worke them ſome miſchiefe:

and againe, when they were taken by the Amalakites, he recouered 
                     & 30. 18. them.
               According to that danger whereunto wiues are ſubiect, muſt an husbands care of protecting his wife be manifeſted.
               1. If ſhe be in danger to be ſeduced and inticed, as Euah was, A wife muſt be kept from being ſeduced. by any euill inſtruments of the deuill, as Ieſuits, Prieſts, Friers, profane, blaſphemous, laſciuious, or riotous perſons; his care muſt be either to keepe them away that they come not at her, or to put them away from her ſo ſoone as he can: he may not ſuffer them to harbour in his houſe.
               2. If by any ſleight ſhe be drawne from his houſe, he muſt A wiſe ſtolne away muſt be fetched home. Iudg. 19. 2. 2 San. 3. 13, 14. 1 Sam. 30. 18. A wiues credit muſt be maintained. ſeeke her, and fetch her againe, as the Leuite did his wife: or cauſe her (if he can) to be brought home againe, as Dauid cauſed Michal to be brought: eſpecially if they be taken away by force, as Ahinoam, and Abigail, Dauids wiues, were.
               3. If ſhe be vniuſtly ſlandered, he is to maintaine her credit and reputation as much as his owne: as Chriſt accounteth himſelfe deſpiſed, when his Church is, ſo muſt he. This care muſt he See Treat. 2. Part 2. §. 31. &c. haue of his wiues credit, euen after her death, as well as while ſhe liueth.
               4. What other miſchiefe ſo euer is intended or practiſed againſt 
                     Luke 10. 16. A wife muſt be defended againſt ſtrangers, ſeruants, and children. Eſt. 7. 7, 8. &c.
                   her, he muſt be a tower of defence to protect her, (as Ahoſhueroſh was to Eſter againſt Haman) and that not only againſt ſtrangers without the houſe, but alſo againſt children and ſeruants in the houſe. Children growne to yeeres, that are ſtout and ſtubborne, will be ready to riſe vp againſt their mother, eſpecially if ſhe be a mother in law, becauſe ſhe is the weaker ſex: the countenance of a father for the moſt part keepeth moſt in awe. Wherefore the husband muſt be an helpe to his wife, and maintaine her honour againſt them: yea though they be children of a former wife.
            
            
               §. 59. Of an husbands maintaining his wife againſt children of a former venter, and ſeruants.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Mothers in law often proue vnkinde, and vniuſt ſtepmothers, and deale vnmercifully with their husbands children: muſt an husband in ſuch caſes aſſiſt his wife againſt his children?
                  
                     Anſw. The protection, I ſpeake of, is in caſe a wife be wronged, then her husband is to doe what he can to right her (as we ſpeake.) But if ſhe be the wrong-doer, he may by no meanes boulſter

her vp againſt his children, and ſo make their wrong the greater. Yet ſo far ought he to reſpect his wife, as by all the faire meanes he can, to labour to pacific her minde, and turne her heart towards them: and if he obſerue her heart to be cleane alienated from them, then to put them forth to be brought vp in ſome other place, and ſo to take away from her the obiect of her diſpleaſure, that he and ſhe may liue more quietly together. For if a man muſt forſake father and mother, he muſt alſo forſake children, and cleaue to his wife. Peace and vnitie betwixt man and wife muſt of all other be kept inuiolable. Though thou caſt away 
                     
                        Licèt omnia proijcias, nihil moleſtius continget quàm non habere beneuolam domi vxorem: peccatum nullum magis dolendum inueneris, quàm cum vxore ſeditionem habere. Chryſoſt. hō. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. Geneſ. 16. 6. & 21. 14. 
                     all, nothing can happen more troubleſome to thee then not to haue a quiet wife at home. Thou canſt finde no ſinne more grieuous then to haue contention with a wife.
                  
                  If a wife muſt be maintained againſt the ſtubbornneſſe of children, much more againſt the inſolencie of ſeruants: for which purpoſe the example of Abraham is recorded, whoſe ſeruant might haue a priuiledge aboue others, becauſe he had made her his bedfellow; yet when ſhe waxed inſolent againſt her miſtreſſe, firſt he put her into her miſtreſſes hand to doe to her as it pleaſed her; and afterwards he caſt her out of his houſe.
               
            
            
               §. 60. Of neglecting to maintaine their wiues.
               
               Contrary is a diſſolute careleſneſſe of husbands, who care no more to helpe and ſuccour their wiues then any other.

If Magiſtrates in a Common-wealth ſhall anſwer for ſuffering ſeducers to come into their dominions to deceiue their people, much more ſhall husbands anſwer for ſuffering them to come and deceiue their wiues.

                     1. Becauſe they haue a greater charge ouer their wiues then Magiſtrates ouer their people.
                     2. Becauſe wiues ought to be dearer to husbands then people to Magiſtrates.
                     3. Becauſe they may ſooner eſpie them in their houſe, then Magiſtrates in the Common-wealth.
                     4. Becauſe they may be much more eaſily kept out of an houſe, then out of a Common-wealth, or a Citie.
                  
               
               2. Others care not whither their wiues wander: and if they 2. In ſuffering

If Chriſt our husband ſhould ſo deale with vs, we ſhould ſoone be loſt: for wee oft goe aſtray like wandring ſheepe, but hee is that good ſhepherd, who ſeeketh after the loſt ſheepe vntill he

As this beſeemeth not any Chriſtian to ſuffer his neighbour to be wronged, (for it is noted as a commendable matter in Moſes, that

on their owne perſons, both by their wiues (who cannot thinke them meet heads to gouerne others) but alſo by their children and ſeruants, who thereby will take occaſion to waxe proud, and preſumptuous againſt him. By deſpiſing the weaker, men grow by little and little to deſpiſe the ſtronger. This men of wiſdome and experience well know: whereupon in Common-wealths and Policies gouerned by wiſe men, the authoritie of inferiour Magiſtrates is vpheld and maintained: ſuperiour Magiſtrates will not ſuffer them who are in authoritie vnder them to be deſpiſed: for it is well knowne, that it tends not to the honour and eaſe only, but to the ſafetie alſo of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, to haue the power and authoritie of inferiour Magiſtrates reſpected, and not trampled vnder feet. It argueth therefore both want of affection, and of diſcretion and vnderſtanding in husbands, to ſuffer childe, ſeruant, or any other in the houſe, to inſult ouer their wiues, who are ioynt gouernours with them ouer the houſe.
            
            
               §. 61. Of an husbands firſt beginning to loue his wife.
               
               The generall matter together with the particular kindes of husbands duties being thus farre handled, The manner alſo of performing them is to be deliuered.
               
                  
                     
                        To inſtruct an husband in the manner of performing his duties to his wife, the Apoſtle laieth downe two patternes,
                        1. Chriſt, verſ. 25.

               As Chriſt loueth his Church, and as we loue our ſelues, ſo muſt men loue their wiues.
               That we may the better follow theſe patternes, we muſt diſtinctly note how Chriſt loueth his Church, and how we The manner of an husbands loue ſet forth by Chriſts manner of louing his Church in ſix branches. 1. Chriſt firſt loueth the Church. loue our ſelues.
               The loue of Chriſt to his Church is commended vnto vs in ſix ſeuerall points: which are

               I. For the Order, Chriſt began to loue his Church: he mafeſted his loue to her before ſhe loued him: as the aire heated by the Sunne is hote, and a wall on which the Sun-beames

ſmite, giueth a reflexion of heat backe againe: ſo the Church, as it were heated and warmed at heart by the ſence of Chriſts loue, loued him, as the Apoſtle expreſly noteth, (We loue him 
                  1 Joh. 4. 19. 
                  becauſe he loued vs firſt:) and the Church her ſelfe acknowledgeth ſaying, Becauſe of the ſauour of thy good ointments 
                  
                     Cant. 1. 2. (wherewith we are reuiued, and cheered) the virgins loue thee.
               
               There is in vs by nature no ſparke of loue at all: if Chriſt Husbands muſt by their loue prouoke their wiues to loue. Pro. 2. 17. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   by his louing of vs firſt, did not inſtill loue into vs, we could no more loue him then a liuing bird riſe out of a cold egge, if it were not kept warme by the dammes ſitting vpon it.
               Thus muſt an husband firſt begin to loue his wife. His place of eminencie, and authority requireth, that he ſhould be to his wife, a guide, which title is expreſly giuen to him by the holy 
                     Sicaput eſt vir, praecedere debet in omnibus bonis factis vxorem ſuam, vt illa imitetur virum, & ſequatur caput ſuum. Aug. de decem chor. c. 3. Ghoſt, to teach him to goe before her, and by his example to inſtruct, and incite her to doe her dutie. What a ſhame would it be for a man who is the Image and glory of God, the head of his wife, in the ſame place to her that Chriſt is to his Church, to be prouoked by his wiues wiue-like carriage (ſhe being the weaker veſſell, vnder him, to learne of him) to loue her? Treat. 1. §. 10. Reaſons there be to ſtirre vp a wife to indeauour to preuent her husband in doing her dutie, which if ſhe doe, it is the greater glory to her; but this patterne of Chriſt ſhould ſtirre him much more to ſtriue to goe before her.
            
            
               §. 62. Of husbands repaying vnkindneſſe for loue.
               
               Contrary, is their diſpoſition, who hauing louing and dutifull wiues, are notwithſtanding nothing moued to loue them againe: but are as vnkinde and churliſh as if they had the moſt 
                     •
                  eeuiſh, and peruerſe wiues that could be. But what ſhall we ſay of ſuch as loue their wiues the leſſe, yea and hate them for their forwardneſſe to loue, and (in teſtimony of true loue) to performe all good dutie? What, but that they are very deuils 
                     •
                  ncarnate? For it is the deuils property to ouercome good with cuill. Theſe make the doctrine of a wiues ſubiection to ſeeme harſh, and a carefull performance thereof, an heauy burden. Neuer ſhall they partake of Chriſts loue, that in their place 
                     •
                  ew themſelues ſo vnlike to Chriſt.
            
            
               
               §. 63. Of the 
                  Treat. 3. §. 57. 2. Chriſt loueth in truth.
                   truth of husbands loue.
               
               II. The truth of Chriſts loue was manifeſted by the fruits thereof to his Church: He gaue himſelfe for it. It was therefore not in word only, no nor only in heart, but in deed alſo. Thus his loue proued profitable, and beneficiall to his Church, which thereby was clenſed, and made a glorious 
                  
                     Verſ. 26, 27. 
                  Church. Had he only borne a tender compaſſion and pittifull affection towards it, or laboured only with comfortable and ſweet words to vphold and ſuccour it, it had ſtill laine polluted with ſinne, in the power of the deuill, and vnder Gods wrath, and ſo receiued no profit and benefit at all.
               So muſt husbands loue their wiues in truth and in deed. 
                  Husbands muſt loue in deed.
                   
                  1 Ioh. 3. 18. Such a loue is required of a man to his brother: much more therefore to his wife, who is not only a ſiſter (as 1 Cor. 9. 5. the Apoſtle expreſly ſtileth her) but neerer then ſiſter, mother, daughter, friend, or any other whatſoeuer. This therefore ſerueth to preſſe the practiſe of all the forenamed duties appertaining to an husband.
            
            
               §. 64. Of husbands diſſimulation.
               
               Contrary is their diſſimulation and hypocriſie, who make great ſhew of much loue, and pretence of earneſt affection, vſing many outward complements, but faile when they come to the trueſt triall, the deed. Some like ſuters or wooers, will promiſe mountaines, but not performe moul-hills: others will coll and kiſſe their wiues much, but truſt them with nothing, nor prouide for them things requiſite: there be that will weepe much when their wiues are ſicke, yet not afford phyſicke and ſuch like things for their recouery: yea many will carrie a faire face all their life long towards their wiues, and at their death leaue them nothing to liue by.
               Hence it is that many who by others are accounted to be very kinde husbands, are by their wiues found to be farre otherwiſe. If triall be made of husbands loue by their practiſe and performance of the forenamed duties, it will be found that they for the moſt part come as farre ſhort in loue, as wiues in ſubiection.
               
            
            
               
               §. 65. Of the freeneſſe of husbands loue.
               
               III. The cauſe of Chriſts loue, was his loue, as Moſes noteth, 3. Chriſt loueth freely. Deut. 7. 7, 8. 
                  He ſet his loue on you, becauſe he loued you. His loue aroſe only, and wholly from himſelfe, and was euery way free: as there was nothing in the Church, before Chriſt loued her to moue him to loue her, ſo can there be nothing that he could hope for afterwards, but what himſelfe beſtowed. Indeed he delighteth in that righteouſneſſe wherewith, as with a glorious robe, ſhe is clothed; and with thoſe heauenly graces, wherewith as with pretious Iewels ſhe is decked: but that righteouſneſſe, and thoſe graces are his owne, and of his free gift, He preſents it to himſelfe a glorious Church. 
                  
                     Eph. 5. 27. Husbands loue muſt be free.
                  
               
               In imitation hereof husbands ſhould loue their wiues, though there were nothing in wiues to moue them ſo to doe, but only that they are their wiues: yea though no future benefit could after be expected from them: true loue hath reſpect to the obiect which is loued, and the good it may doe thereunto, rather then to the ſubiect which loueth, and the good that it may receiue. For loue ſeeketh not her owne. 
                  1 Cor. 13. 5.
               
               Chriſts loue in this branch thereof ſhould further moue husbands to doe what lieth in their power, to make their wiues worthy of loue: thus will it be in truth ſaid, that they dwell with their wiues according to knowledge: and thus will their 1 Pet. 3. 7.

               §. 66. Of husbands louing for aduantage.
               
               Contrary is their loue which is only for their owne content 
                     •
                  nd aduantage. Many can loue no further then they may haue

               §. 67. Of the puritie of husbands loue.
               
               IIII. Chriſts loue for the qualitie is an holy, pure, chaſte, 4. Chriſts loue pure. Eph. 5. 26, 27. 
                  
                     ••
                  ue: as he himſelfe is, ſo is his loue, as is euident by the 
                     ••
                  fect thereof: for it moued him to ſanctifie and clenſe his
                  
                  Church, to make it a glorious Church without ſpot: he did therefore no way pollute or defile his Spouſe: and that his loue might the better appeare to be chaſte loue, caſt only vpon one Spouſe and not many, he vnited all his Saints together by the 1 Cor. 12. 12, 13 bond of his Spirit, and made them all one body.
               
               Hereby husbands muſt learne ſo to be affected towards Husbands loue muſt be chaſte. Heb. 13. 4. their wiues as may ſtand with holineſſe, and chaſtitie: though much loue be required, yet it may not ouer-flowe thoſe banks. Mariage is honourable and a bed vndefiled. It muſt therefore be vſed as an vndefiled thing. This indeed appertaineth to the wife as well as to the husband. But becauſe he is the head, and guide of his wife, and ought to be as a patterne and preſident before her, as Chriſt is before him, therefore is it more ſpecially applied to him. The puritie of an husbands loue here ſpoken of, hath a double vſe,
               1. It reſtraineth an husbands loue to his owne wife. There is a generall Chriſtian loue whereby all occaſions of doing good are taken, with which an husband may, and ought to loue others: and a particular matrimoniall loue, whereby he is moued to preferre his wife before all, and to haue his heart ſet and fixed on her, and ſo proper and peculiar to her.
               2. It orders and moderates his loue, ſo as it turneth not into ſinfull luſt, whereby that eſtate, (which in it ſelfe by vertue of Gods ordinance, is holy) is polluted.

               The quantity of Chriſts loue cannot be expreſſed: for the 5 Chriſts loue extended to the giuing of himſelfe meaſure of it was aboue meaſure.

pretended manhood of ſuch husbands as vpon euery iealous ſurmize and ſleight report, are ready to make challenges of fight, and to enter into ſingle combats and duels, on pretence of maintaining their wiues honour. This being no warrantable courſe of righting a wrong, no honour can redound to the wife thereby, but much diſhonour and danger to the husband. If he preuaile ouer his aduerſarie and kill, he is made guilty of murther thereby, and ſo reproach and ſhame muſt needs come to himſelfe, wife, and whole family: if he be ouercome and ſlaine, ſhe may be reputed more guilty then ſhe was before. And oft it falleth out that God in iuſt iudgement giueth ouer the challenger into his aduerſaries hand, becauſe he hath vndertaken ſo indirect a courſe.

                  Treat. 3. §. 6. 6 Chriſts loue perpetuall.
                   Conſtancy in loue.
               
               VI. The continuance of Chriſts loue was without date: 
                     Ioh. 13. 1. 
                  Hauing loued his owne, he loued them vnto the end. His loue was conſtant (not by fits, now louing, then hating) and 
                     Hoſ. 2. 19. 
                  euerlaſting (neuer repenting thereof, neuer changing or altering his minde) no prouocations, no tranſgreſſions could euer make him forget to loue, and ceaſe to doe that good which he intended for his Church: note what he ſaid to her euen when ſhe reuoulted from him, Thou haſt played the harlot with many 
                  
                     Ier. 3. 1. 2 Sam. 7. 15. 
                  louers, yet returne againe to me: and againe, My mercy ſhall not depart away.
               
               For his loue reſteth not on the deſert of his Church, but on the vnchangeableneſſe of his owne will. As this manifeſted Chriſts loue to be true ſound loue, ſo it made it profitable and beneficiall to the Church, which, notwithſtanding her many frailties, by virtue hereof is glorified.
               This laſt branch muſt be added to all the former branches Husbands muſt be conſtant in their loue. of an husbands loue, or elſe they will be all in vaine and to no purpoſe. This giueth the trueſt tryall of ſound loue. Such was the loue betwixt Dauid and Ionathan: the ſoundeſt loue that euer was, betwixt partie and partie. This bringeth the greateſt glory to the partie which loueth: and the greateſt benefit to the partie which is loued. That a mans loue may thus remaine firme and inuiolable,
               1. He muſt be ſure to lay a good foundation; he muſt

ground his loue on Gods ordinance: and loue his wife in regard of the matrimoniall bond which knitteth them together, and that neere vnion which thence ariſeth; and ſo it will laſt ſo long as that knot laſteth.
               2. He muſt further ſupport and ſtrengthen it with an inuiolable reſolution to be changed and altered with no prouocation, but rather to paſſe by all infirmities; indeauouring in loue to redreſſe them if poſſibly he can: if not, to beare with them.
            
            
               §. 73. Of husbands variableneſſe.

                     Queſt. Is not the former patterne ſufficient? Is this latter more excellent, or more perfect?
                  
                     Anſw. Chriſts example is a full, compleat, perfect, and To Chriſts example, the patterne of ones ſelfe is added. euery way ſufficient patterne; farre more excellent then this of a mans ſelfe: this is not annexed to adde any thing to that, or in regard of the excellency hereof, but only in regard of our dulneſſe, to make the point ſomewhat more plaine and perſpicuous. 1. Becauſe it is more ſenſible. For this patterne is more ſenſible and better diſcerned. Euery one knoweth how he loueth his owne body: but few or none know how Chriſt loueth his Church. Beſides, 2. Becauſe it is more imitable. that example of Chriſt may ſeeme too high and excellent for any to attaine vnto, euen inimitable; therefore to ſhew that he requireth no more then a man may performe, if he will ſet himſelfe with care and conſcience to doe his duty, he addeth the patterne of ones ſelfe; that which one doth to his body, if he will, he may doe to his wife.
                  No direction can be taken from this latter patterne, but The patterne of louing ones ſelfe ſetteth forth the ſame things that Chriſts loue doth. might be referred to the former, as moſt of the former (though in a farre meaner manner) may be referred to the latter. For the loue which a man beareth to himſelfe is true, and intire without all diſſimulation: the moſt diſſembling wretch in the world (who in his dealings with other men doth nothing vprightly) nor will nor can diſſemble with himſelfe; though other men ſhall neuer know the depth of his heart, yet the ſpirit 
                     1 Cor. 2. 11. 
                     which is in him, euen himſelfe, knoweth it: ſo as this patterne alſo preſſeth truth and ſincerity on husbands in their affection towards their wiues: of all other they may not diſſemble and deale doubly with them; but let them know the intireneſſe of their affection towards them: and ſee they neither faune o
                        •
                      them, nor flatter them. They which pretend great loue to their wiues in ſhew only, offend againſt nature it ſelfe. As the foreſaid loue of a mans owne ſelfe is for manner intire and true, ſo alſo free not forced: and for meaſure as great as poſſibly i
                        •
                      can be, and for continuance, conſtant, and ſo like to Chriſt loue. But there are two points eſpecially to be conſidered in the loue of ones ſelfe which aboue others are moſt ſenſibly diſcerned Man is tender towards himſelfe. in this patterne. 1. Tenderneſſe. 2. Cheerefulneſſe.
                  
                  No other man will or can ſo tenderly handle a mans hand

arme, legge or any other part of his body, as himſelfe: he is very ſenſible of his owne ſmart.
                  The metaphors which the Apoſtle vſeth in theſe words, He nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, doe liuely ſet forth this tenderneſſe: 
                        Eph. 5. 29. for they are taken from fowles and birds which very charily, and tenderly houer ouer their young ones, couering them all ouer with their wings and feathers, but ſo bearing vp their bodies as no weight lieth vpon them.
                  Thus ought husbands with all tenderneſſe, and mildneſſe Husbands muſt deale tenderly with their wiues. to deale with their wiues, as we haue before noted in many particulars: only this example of a mans ſelfe I thought good to ſet before husbands, as a liuely patterne wherein they might behold a preſident without exception, going before them, and whereby they might receiue excellent direction for the better performing of the particulars before noted.
                  Againe, no friend, no parent, no other party will or can ſo Man is cheerefull in doing himſelfe good. willingly and cheerefully doe any kindneſſe for one, as a man for himſelfe. This among other is one eſpeciall point which the law aimeth at, when it enioynes a man to loue his neighbour 
                     
                        Leu. 19. 18. 
                     as himſelfe, namely, as willingly and readily as himſelfe. Whatſoeuer a man doth for himſelfe he doth much more cheerefully then for another. There needeth no other proofe then experience. Let men take notice of their owne minde and diſpoſition when they doe things for themſelues, and this will be as cleere as the light when the Sunne ſhineth forth at 
                        •
                     oone day.
                  Such an affection ought husbands to haue to their wiues: Husbands muſt be cheerefull in ſeeking their wiues good. they ought more willingly and cheerefully to doe any thing 
                        •
                     or their wiues then for parents, children, friends or any other. Though this cheerefulneſſe be an inward diſpoſition of the

Contrary is the diſpoſition of thoſe husbands who ſo grudgingly, repiningly, and diſcontentedly doe thoſe things which they doe in their wiues behalfe, as their wiues had rather they were not done at all. The manner of doing them cauſeth more griefe to tender hearted wiues, then the things themſelues can doe good.
                  Hitherto of the manner which husbands ought to obſerue in performing their duties. The reaſons to inforce the ſame remaine to be handled.
               
            
            
               §. 75. Of Chriſts example, a motiue to prouoke husbands to loue their wiues.
               
               The forenamed examples of Chriſt and of our ſelues as 
                  Generall reaſons. 1. Chriſts example. they are patternes for our direction, ſo generall motiues to prouoke and ſtirre vs vp the more to performe all the forenamed duties after the manner preſcribed.
               A greater, and ſtronger motiue cannot be yeelded then the Chriſts example the greateſt motiue that can be. example of Chriſt. Example in it ſelfe is of great force to prouoke vs to doe any thing: eſpecially if it be the example of ſome great one, a man of place and renoune.
               But who greater then Chriſt? What more worthy patterne? If (as was Treat. 3. §. 74. ſhewed) the example of the Church be of great force to moue wiues to be ſubiect to their husbands, the example of Chriſt muſt needs be of much greater force to moue husbands to loue their wiues. A great honour it is to be like vnto Chriſt: and his example is a perfect patterne.
               Two things there be which in Chriſts example are eſpecially Two things in Chriſts patterne prouoke huſbands to loue their wiues. to be noted to moue husbands to loue their wiues.
               1. That great inequality which is betwixt him and his ſpouſe.
               2. That ſmall benefit which he reapeth by louing her.
               For the better diſcerning of that inequality, the greatneſſe of 1. The great inequality betwixt Chriſt and his ſpouſe. Chriſt on the one ſide, and the meaneſſe of the Church on the other, are duly to be weighed.
               Chriſts greatneſſe is in Scripture ſet forth by comparing him with creatures, and the Creator. Compared with creatures he is farre more excellent then the moſt excellent, as the Apoſtle by many arguments proueth in the firſt chapter to Hebr. that whole chapter is ſpent in proofe of this point: And in

another place it is ſaid that 
                     Eph. 1. 21. 
                  He is ſet farre aboue all principality and power, and might, and dominion, and euery name that is named not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come.
               
               Compared with the Creator he is no whit inferiour to him, but 
                     Phil. 2. 6. 
                  equall: 
                  
                     Heb. 1. 3. 
                  Being the brightneſſe of glory, and the expreſſe image of his perſon: and that 
                     Iob. 1. 1, 3. 
                  word of whom it is ſaid, In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God: All things were made by him &c. So as he is the very Creator himſelfe, eternall, infinite, incomprehenſible. Thus is Chriſts greatneſſe inexplicable.
               The meaneſſe of the Church is as low on the other ſide: ſhe is a creature, faſhioned out of the earth, proceeding from the loines of corrupt Adam, not only finite, but in it ſelfe vile and baſe: The Prophet 
                     Ezec. 16. 1. &c.
                   
                  Ezechiel doth ſet her forth in her liuely colours as ſhe is in her ſelfe. Compared therefore vnto Chriſt ſhe is 
                     Iſa. 40. 17. 
                  nothing, leſſe then nothing. What equality, what proportion can there then be betwixt Chriſt and her?
               But if man and woman be compared together, we ſhall finde a neere equality: and that both in the points of their humiliation, and alſo of their exaltation. In regard of the former, they are both of the ſame mould, of the ſame corrupt nature, ſubiect to the ſame infirmities, at length brought to the ſame end. In regard of the latter the beſt and greateſt priuiledges are common to both of them: they are both made after the ſame image, redeemed by the ſame price, partakers of the ſame grace, and heires together of the ſame inheritance.
               
                  
                     Queſt. What is then the preferment of the male kinde? What is the excellency of an husband?
                  
                     Anſw. Only outward and momentany. Outward, in the things of this world only: for 
                        Gal. 3. 28. 
                     in Chriſt Ieſus they are both one. Momentany, for the time of this life only: for 
                        Mat. 22. 30. 
                     in the reſurrection they neither marie, nor are giuen in mariage, but are as the Angels of God in heauen: then all ſubiection of wiues to husbands ceaſeth.
                  To conclude this point, the inequality betwixt Chriſt and the Church, and equality betwixt man and wife being ſuch as hath beene declared; ſeeing Chriſt vouchſafeth to loue his Church, ought not man thereby be moued to loue his wife?
                  
                     
The other point concerning the ſmall benefit which Chriſt 
                     2. The ſmall benefit that Chriſt reapeth by louing his Church. 
                     reapeth by his Church, will yet further inforce the point: for illuſtration whereof we will note the great benefit which man reapeth by his wife.
                  The benefit which Chriſt reapeth from the Church is in one word nothing. For Chriſt is in himſelfe Al-ſufficient: he neither needeth any thing, nor can receiue any thing: 
                        Iob 35. 7. 
                     If thou be eſt righteous, what giueſt thou to him? Or what receiueth he of thine hand? Yet abundantly he beſtoweth all manner of gifts, temporall, and ſpirituall, earthly and heauenly. It was not therefore his owne good that he reſpected in louing the Church, but her good: for he being 1 Tim. 3. 16. 
                     God became man; being Lord of heauen and earth, he tooke vpon him 
                        Phil. 2. 6, 7. 
                     the forme of a ſeruant; being 2 Cor. 8 9. 
                     rich he became poore: hauing the 
                        Reu. 1. 18. 
                     Keyes of hell and of death, and being 
                        Act. 3. 15. the Lord of life, he 
                        Phil. 2. 8. 
                     humbled himſelfe, and became obedient vnto the death: thus to ſhew loue to his Church he left much for her ſake, but receiued nothing of her.
                  But the benefit which man reapeth from a wife is very great: for 
                        Gen. 2. 18. 
                     It was not good for a man to be alone: in ſo much as 
                        Pro. 18. 22. 
                     He who findeth a wife findeth a good thing; and that in all the points of goodneſſe, a profitable thing, a comfortable thing, a delightfull thing. They know not the benefit of the maried eſtate, who See Treat. 2. Part. 1. §. 27. prefer ſingle life before it, eſpecially if the maried eſtate be ordered by Gods word, and man and wife carefull to performe their owne duty each to other.
                  To apply this point alſo, and to bring it to the concluſion: Chriſts example remoueth all pretences which men make for not louing their wiues. If Chriſt who can receiue nothing from the Church notwithſtanding loue her, ought not men much more to loue their wiues, who many waies receiue much good from them, and without whom they cannot well be?
                  This example of Chriſt is the rather to be noted, becauſe it cleane wipeth away all thoſe falſe colours, and vaine pretences which many alledge as reaſons, to ſhew that there is little reaſon they ſhould loue their wiues: ſome of their pretences are theſe.
               
               
                  1. Their wiues are of a farre meaner ranke then 1. Obiect.
                      themſelues; ſhould they then performe duty to their inferiours?

They commonly who marrie their kitchin maids, or others farre vnder their degree, alledge this pretence.
                  
                     Anſw. I might reply, That mariage aduanceth a wife to the degree of her husband: and that it was his owne follie to marrie one ſo meane: but for the purpoſe and point in hand, let any tell me, whether the ſuppoſed diſparitie betwixt them & their wiues, be in any degree comparable to that which is betwixt Chriſt and the Church: yet Chriſt thinketh not much to doe duties of loue to his Church.
               
               
                  2. There is nothing in their wiues worthy to be loued. 2. Obiect.
                     
                  
                  
                     Anſw. This very thing, that ſuch an one is thy wife, is matter enough to make her worthy of loue. But what was there in the Church to make her worthy of Chriſts loue? If it be ſaid that ſhe is endued with many excellent graces, which make her amiable in Chriſts ſight: I anſwer, that of her ſelfe ſhe hath none of thoſe graces, Chriſt hath beſtowed them vpon her, and ſo made her 
                        •
                     miable: and thus oughteſt thou to endeuour by vſing all good meanes thou canſt to make thy wife anſwerable to thy loue: but howſoeuer, to loue her.
               
               
                  3. Their wiues giue iuſt occaſion to be hated by reaſon of their 3. Obiect.
                      beeuiſhneſſe, ſtoutneſſe, inſolencie, and other like intolerable 
                        •
                     ices.
                  
                     Anſw. No occaſion may ſeeme iuſt to moue an husband to hate his wife: nor any vice ſeeme to him intolerable: with goodnes he 
                        ••
                     ught to ouercome euill. If notorious ſins ſeemed intolerable to Chriſt, or that he thought any occaſion iuſt to cauſe hatred, many 
                        •
                     hat are of his Church would oft draw his hatred vpon them: but Chriſt hateth neuer a member of his Church.
               
               
                  4. There is no hope that euer I ſhall receiue any helpe of my 4. Obiect.
                      wife, or benefit from her.
                  
                     Anſ. There is little charitie in ſuch as can conceiue no hope: for 
                        
                           •
                        ue hopeth all things: but yet the caſe ſo ſtandeth with Chriſt. The 1. Cor. 13. 7. Church is ſo vtterly vnable to help or benefit him, as he may iuſtly 
                        •
                     y, he cannot hope to receiue any thing frō her. Chriſt loueth the 
                        •
                     hurch for her own good, not for his; ſo ought husbands. Thus if Chriſts example be well weighed, & obſerued of husbands, it will 
                        •
                     ford matter enough to remoue euery doubt or ſcruple raiſed to 
                        •
                     enate their affections from their wiues. Fitly therefore hath the

Apoſtle ſet it before husbands, both to direct them how to loue their wiues, and alſo to moue them ſo to doe.
               
            
            
               §. 76. Of a mans loue to himſelfe, a motiue to prouoke him to loue his wife.
               
               To the ſame purpoſe that Chriſts example tendeth, tendeth alſo the patterne of a mans ſelfe. Great is the affection that a man beareth to himſelfe, to his owne fleſh, his owne bodie: he neuer hateth, but euer loueth himſelfe: no ſore, no diſeaſe, no paine, no ſtinch that the fleſh bringeth to a man, can make him hate it: but rather all manner of infirmities doe make him the more to pitty, tender, and cheriſh it. This is a worke of nature: the moſt heatheniſh, and barbarous, that euer were, doe it. Now a wife being to a man as his bodie and his fleſh (for they two are one fleſh) and God hauing commanded men to loue their wiues as their owne bodies, theſe concluſions will neceſſarily follow from this motiue:
               1. He that loueth not his wife is more caried with the inſtinct of nature, then with the expreſſe charge of the God of nature. Natures inſtinct moueth him to loue his bodie. But Gods expreſſe charge moueth him not, to loue his wife.
               2. He that loueth not his wife is worſe then an infidell and a barbarian, yea then a very beaſt: for all theſe loue their owne bodies, and their owne fleſh: but a wife (by Gods ordinance) is as ones bodie, and his fleſh.
               3. He that loueth his wife loueth himſelfe: the Apoſtle himſelfe 
                     verſ. 28. in theſe very words layeth downe this concluſion: from whence by the rule of contraries this alſo will follow, He that loueth not his wife, loueth not himſelfe.
               
               4. He that loueth not his wife cannot but bring woe and miſchiefe vpon himſelfe. For the damage and miſchiefe which followeth on a wife, through any neglect of dutie on her husband part, followeth alſo on him: as the miſchiefe which followeth on the bodie through any negligence of the head, lighteth alſo on the head.
               If theſe be not motiues ſufficient to prouoke an husband to loue his wife, I know not what can be ſufficient.

                  2. Honour thy father and mother (which is the first commandement with promiſe.)
                  
                  3. That it may be well with thee: and thou maiſt liue long on the earth.
                  
               
               
                  THe ſecond couple in a familie are

                     Parents.
                     Children.
                  
               
               In laying downe their duties, the Apoſtle beginneth with children: his direction, and inſtigation vnto them is laid downe in the three firſt verſes of the ſixt chapter: wherein

                     1. He declareth their dutie.
                     
                     2. He addeth reaſons to inforce the ſame.
                  
               
               In laying downe their dutie he noteth three points.

                     1. Wherein it conſiſteth, (obey, honour.)
                     
                     2. To whom it is to be performed (your parents.)
                     
                     3. After what manner it is to be done (in the Lord.)
                     
                  
               
               The reaſons vſed by the Apoſtle are foure.

                     1. The place of parents (in the Lord.)
                     
                     2. The aequitie of the thing (this is right.)
                     
                     3. The charge of God (Honour thy father, &c.)
                     4. The reward promiſed (That it may goe well, &c.)
                  
               
               
                  
Vnder this word (obey) which the Apoſtle vſeth, and that word (honour) which the law vſeth, are all thoſe duties compriſed, which any where thorowout the whole Scripture are inioyned to children.
               We will therefore ſet them downe in ſome order, and handle them diſtinctly one after another.

                     1. The Fountaine of childrens duties is to be ſearched out.
                     2. The Streames that flow from thence are to be obſerued.
                  
               
               The Fountaine is an inward diſpoſition of the heart compounded of loue and feare.
               
               The Streames iſſuing from thence extend vnto parents, both while they are liuing, and alſo when they are dead.
               
               
                  
                     
                        Childrens duties which are to be performed to their parents while they liue, haue reſpect to their
                        
                           Authoritie.

               Their Body with decency muſt be buried.
               
               Their Credit with honour muſt be maintained.
               
            
            
               §. 2. Of Childrens loue to their Parents.
               
               I make the fountaine of childrens duties to be a mixed and compound diſpoſition, in reſpect of that authoritie and affection which is mixed together in parents. The authoritie of parents requireth feare in children: and their affection, loue. So intire and ſo ardent is parents affection towards their children, as it would make children too bold and inſolent if there were not authoritie mixed therewith to worke feare: and ſo ſupreme and abſolute is their authoritie ouer them, as it would make children like ſlaues to dread their parents, if a fatherly affection were not tempered therewith to breed loue. But both theſe ioyned together make a very good compoſition: loue like ſugar ſweetneth feare, and feare like ſalt ſeaſoneth loue: and thus, to ioyne them both together, it is a louing-feare, or a fearingloue, which is the ground of childrens duties.
               
                  
Where Chriſt forbiddeth an exceſſiue loue in children to 
                     Mat. 10. 37. their parents, he implieth that parents are a fit obiect for children to loue (ſo as their loue be wel moderated:) yea he implieth that it is an affection euen by nature ingraffed in children to loue their parents. Ioſeph is commended vnto children as a worthy patterne in louing his father, and that from his youth till the deceaſe of his father: in teſtimony whereof in his younger yeeres he brought to his father the euill report of his 
                  
                     Gen. 37. 2. 
                  brethren, whereby he incurred their enuie and hatred, which he would neuer haue done, if he had not loued his father: and hauing beene long abſent from his father, when by Gods prouidence there was offered an occaſion for him to meet with his brethren, one of his firſt queſtions to them was about their father: 
                     Gen. 43. 7. and hearing that he was liuing, he thought it not enough to ſend him food for his need, but muſt alſo needs ſee his face, 
                     Gen. 45. 9. and haue him dwell with him: and while his father was in the way he went out to meet him, and at firſt ſight fell on his neck, 
                     Gen. 46. 29. and wept a good while (a token of great affection.)
               That loue which naturally parents beare to their children, Reaſons. 1. Equitie. ought in equitie to breed in children a loue to their parents. For loue deſerueth loue: and moſt vnworthy are they to be loued, who cannot loue againe. The loue of parents aboue all others is to be anſwered with loue on childrens part to the vttermoſt of their power, becauſe it is free, great, and conſtant.
               Beſides, there is a neceſſitie of loue in children to their parents, 2 Neceſſitie. leſt for want thereof, their ſubiection (which of all others ought to be moſt free) ſhould turne into ſlauiſh ſeruitude.
               This ought children the rather to labour after, becauſe by nature they are nothing ſo prone to loue their parents, as their parents are to loue them. Loue is weightie, and, as weighty things, it deſcendeth. Children therefore with conſcience of dutie muſt labour to make ſupply of this defect, and helpe nature by grace. I denie not but naturally there is in children a greater loue to their parents, then to others: yet in compariſon of the heat of parents loue to them, their loue to their parents is but cold. Wherfore as the heat of the Sun ſhining much and long on a ſtone wall, draweth a reflection of heat from that wall: ſo the hot beames of parents loue, which with

feruency and conſtancy is caſt on children, ought to prouoke and ſtirre vp children to ſend forth a reflection of loue on their parents.
               Two extreames are contrary to this affection of loue.
               One is want of naturall affection, which is a vice moſt odious 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Rom. 1. 30. 2 Tim. 3. 3. and abominable in all, but moſt of all in children. The Apoſtle reckoneth this among the moſt heighnous vices that be.
               The other is hatred and deſpight of parents: a vice more then monſtrous, and vnnaturall. From thence commeth mocking and curſing of parents, whereof we ſhall afterwards heare.
            
            
               §. 3. Of a childes feare of his parent.
               
               To the forenamed dutie of loue, muſt feare be added, which is a childes awfull reſpect of his parent.
               
               This awfull reſpect ariſeth from an honourable eſteeme which a childe in his iudgement and opinion hath of his parent, as he is his parent; and from it proceedeth on the one ſide, a deſire and indeauour in all things to pleaſe the parent, and on the other ſide a loathneſſe to offend him.
               In this reſpect the feare of a childe is oppoſed to the feare of a ſlaue. For a childes feare being mixed with loue, hath reſpect to the offence which a parent may take; but a ſlaues feare, which is ordinarily mixed with hatred, hath reſpect to nothing but the puniſhment which his maſter may inflict vpon him. The forenamed feare is ſo proper to children, as that awfull reſpect which the Saints beare to God, is called a See Treat. 1. §. 4. 
                  ſiliall or child-like feare.

                  lly when parents are ſpeaking, or till parents giue leaue to

their children to ſpeake,) and in breaking off ſpeech, when parents come into the place where children are ſpeaking, are tokens of great reuerence. Thus children teſtifie that there are ſome in place whom they much reſpect and honour.

Verſ. 25. their parents ſpeech; which Iob alſo noteth in theſe words, Vnto me men gaue eare, and waited, and kept ſilence. Though parents in their ſpeech ſeeme to be long and tedious, yet muſt children indure it.
               And it is very needfull that patience be added to ſilence, becauſe many parents in tender loue of their children, and earneſt deſire of their good, thinke they can neuer ſpeake enough in inſtructing and admoniſhing them. The many exhortations 
                     Gen. 49. 2. Pro. 1. 8, & 4. 1. & 7. 1. giuen in Scripture vnto children to heare, hearken, giue eare, giue heed, marke, and obſerue the words of their parents, doe imply the forenamed ſilence and patience: for they who 
                     Iam 1. 19. ought to be ſwift to heare muſt be ſlow to ſpeake. I denie not but much more is intended vnder thoſe phraſes, namely, obedience: yet muſt theſe alſo be preſuppoſed: for he that will not in ſilence patiently hearken to his parents while they ſpeake, will much leſſe obey what they ſay.
               Contrary to ſilence is ſawcineſſe (as we ſpeake) and ouermuch Contrary, 1. boldneſſe of ſpeech. boldneſſe in children, when, without due reſpect of their parents preſence, they will be prating of this thing or that thing: inſomuch as if ſtrangers ſhould come into the roome where ſuch children are, they would not thinke that their parents were in preſence; or if they knew it, they might well thinke that ſuch children beare little reſpect to their parents.
               Contrary to patience in hearing, is fretting and murmuring 2. Impatient hearkening to parents. againſt parents (if at leaſt their ſpeech be any whit long) an

               §. 6. Of the vices in children contrary to the forenamed reuerence in ſpeech.
               
               Contrary to thoſe branches of reuerence in ſpeech are, Contrary, 1. Scorning to acknowledge a parent.
               
               1. Pride: when children ſcorne to giue the title of Father, or Mother, to their parents. This is the minde of many who haue gotten more wealth or honour, then euer their parents had. In publicke eſpecially ſuch children moſt refuſe to giue thoſe titles. Salomon was not ſo minded. He being a great king, ſitting vpon his throne, in ſight and hearing of all his people that were about him, called Bathſheba Mother. 
                  1 King. 2. 20.
               
               If children had that regard to the honour of their parents which they ſhould, they being themſelues in places of honour and dignity, would the rather openly call their parents Father and Mother, that they might be knowne to be the father and mother of ſo eminent a perſon.
               2. Loquacity, and too much importunity, or rather impudency 2. Too much importunitie. in ſpeech, when children hauing to doe with their parents, can neuer haue done (as we ſpeake) but muſt needs v

matters to the very vttermoſt. Many parents are oft much prouoked hereby. It skilleth not that the childe haue the right, eſpecially in a matter of no great conſequence. For reuerence ſake the childe muſt forbeare, at leaſt for a time. And if the matter of difference be weighty, as in points of religion, the child muſt either take ſome other opportunity of better informing his parent, or elſe get ſome other wiſe friend to doe it.
               3. Stoutneſſe, when children anſwer their parents as if they 3. Stout anſwers. Ne filius cum patre quoquo modo expoſtulet, cum lex interdixit, tum anteleges ipſa natura. Greg. Naz. in ſenten. Matt. 21. 29. Luke 15. 29. were their equals: giuing word for word. It doth as ill become children to anſwer againe, as ſeruants (to whom the Apoſtle hath expreſly forbidden it, Tit. 2. 9.) Both law and nature forbiddeth children to be prouoked hereunto, by any thing that their parents ſay or doe; how great then is their fault who giue ſcornefull and ſtout words to their parents when they are no way prouoked, as the elder ſonne noted in the pa

It is laid downe as a caueat to parents, that they prouoke not their children to wrath. How much more muſt children obſerue that cauear?

               As the ſpeech, ſo the cariage of children towards their parents muſt be ſeaſoned with reuerence: for

                     1. This is a fruit, and proofe of filiall feare as well as that.
                     
                     2. Of the two, this is the ſurer euidence: for actions are better ſignes of the diſpoſition of the heart then words.
                     3. Faire words ioyned with contrary deeds, cannot but be accounted meerely complementall and hypocriticall.
                     4. Where there is a contrariety betwixt words and deeds, the one will be a witneſſe againſt the other, and that mans condemnation the greater. Childrens reuerence to their parents manifeſted, 1. by meeting them.
                     
                  
               
               Wherefore let all reuerence be manifeſted in childrens behauiour to their parents, and that in theſe and ſuch like inſtances.
               1. If a parent be comming to a childe, and the childe obſerue it, let him haſte to meet his parent: ſo did 
                     Gen. 46. 29. 
                  Ioſeph to his father, and 1 King. 2. 19. 
                  Salomon to his mother. Which two examples

are the rather to be noted, becauſe both were in eminent place: one a great gouernour, the other a king.
               2. Let ſuch child-like obeiſance be performed as becommeth 2. By obeyſance to them. the age and ſex, either in going to, remaining before, or going from a parent: as vncouering the head, bending the knee, bowing the body, ſtanding vp, with the like. The two forenamed eminent perſons, 
                     Gen. 48. 12. 
                  Ioſeph and 1 King. 2. 19. 
                  Solomon, bowed, the one to his father, the other to his mother.
               3. Let the countenance, and geſture of the body be ſo ſoberly 3 By well compoſing the countenance. and modeſtly ordered in the preſence of the parent, as may argue due reſpect.
               4. Let the vpper place, and hand be giuen to parents: and 4. By giuing the vpper hand. if occaſionally a childe be aboue his parent, let him come below him. For that is a manifeſt token of inferiority and ſubiection. What maketh men to ſtriue for the vpper hand, but becauſe they would be accounted better then thoſe with whom they ſtriue? But that ought not to be the minde of children to their parents.
               
                  
                     Queſt. What if children be in eſtate more wealthy, or honourable then their parents, are they then to giue the hand to them?
                  
                     Anſw. No honour is comparable to the dignity of fatherhood: it giueth a greater eminency to the parent ouer his childe, then any other honour can to the childe ouer his parent. I grant that a childe may by ſome office, and outward dignity be ſo aduanced aboue his father, as other men may more honour and reuerence the childe, and giue the vpper place to him: and for order ſake the childe may and ought to take it in company: but when they are alone, the childe muſt rather reuerence the father.
                  5. According to the cuſtome of the time and place wherein 5. By asking bleſſing. they liue, let children aske their parents bleſſing.
               
            
            
               §. 9. Of childrens asking their parents bleſſing, whether it be lawfull or no.
               
               Some doubt is made of this duty both in regard of the thing it ſelfe, and alſo of the geſture of kneeling vſed in the performance thereof: I will therefore diſtinctly proue both.
               For the thing, it is noted of Iaakob that he carried ſauory

meat to his father, that he might bleſſe him: and of Ioſeph, that 
                     Gen. 27. 19. he went to his father, and carried his two ſonnes with him, 
                     Gen. 48. 1. &c.
                   that his father might bleſſe both him and them: for which end the twelue ſonnes of Iaakob aſſembled to their father. 
                     Gen. 49. 1. &c. How the bleſſings which the patriarchs gaue their children are patterns to others.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Theſe were extraordinary examples: the Patriarchs were indued with the ſpirit of propheſie, whereby they reuealed to their children what their eſtate ſhould be in the times to come: for knowledge whereof their children came to them.
                  1. Anſw. Their bleſſings were more then predictions of things to come: they were confirmations and aſſurances to the See Treat. 6. §. 58. children that God would indeed performe that bleſſing which their parents had pronounced. For they ſuſtained a double perſon: the perſon of a Prophet, and of a father; as prophets they foretold things to come: as fathers they obtained the bleſſings pronounced, and an aſſurance thereof to their children, 
                        Heb. 11. 20. and that by faith and praier.
                  2. Anſw. Though all parents cannot with ſuch an extraordinary ſpirit aſſure vnto their children any diſtinct particular bleſſing, yet the faithfull praier of parents is an eſpeciall, and ordinary meanes to obtaine a bleſſing from God vpon their children: and that becauſe of Gods promiſe which extends 
                        Gen. 17. 7. Act. 2. 39. it ſelfe not only to fathfull parents, but alſo to their ſeed. Wherefore as the children of the patriarches came to their fathers to be aſſured of ſome extraordinary bleſſing, ſo may other children goe to their parents as a meanes to obtaine an ordinary bleſſing. It is noted of Eliah that by an extraordinary ſpirit in praier he obtained extraordinary matters: Yet 
                        Iam. 5. 17. the Apoſtle ſetteth forth that example to all Chriſtians as a motiue to ſtirre them vp in faith to pray for ordinary bleſſings. But for further clearing of this point, note the phraſe 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                      vſed in the fift commandement as a reaſon to moue children to honour their parents: this it is word for word, That they may prolong thy daies, &c. how can parents prolong their childrens daies, but by begging that bleſſing of God? See Treat. 6. §. 4. Prou. 15. 8. How wicked parents may bleſſe their children. The praiers then of parents are a great bleſſing to children, and children ought to ſeeke this bleſſing of their parents.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. If parents be wicked, their praier is abomination:

what bleſſing then can children looke for from wicked parents?
                  
                     Anſw. Though God heare not wicked parents in loue and goodneſſe to themſelues, yet for the good of their children he may and will heare them: and that the rather to maintaine a reuerend reſpect of parents in the heart of their children. For asking a bleſſing is an acknowledgement of ſuperiority and authority, according to that of the Apoſtle, The leſſe is bleſſed 
                     
                        Heb. 7. 7. 
                     of the greater.
                  
                  Concerning the geſture of kneeling, it is anſwerable to the It is lawfull for children to kneele to their parents. Gen. 48. 12. geſture which of old was vſed by Gods people in like caſe: of Ioſeph it is ſaid that he bowed downe himſelfe with his face to the earth.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Kneeling is a geſture proper to Gods worſhip.
                  
                     Anſw. It is not ſo proper, but that it may be vſed in ciuill caſes: elſe Chriſt would haue reproued the young man for kneeling before him as well as for calling him good: for he conceiued 
                        Mar. 10. 17. Chriſt to be but a meere man, and the worſhip he did him was but ciuill.
                  It is not ſimply the geſture, but the occaſion of the geſture, the minde of him that performeth it, and the end why he performeth it that maketh it diuine, or ciuill. Cornelius fell down before Peter with conceit of ſome diuine excellency in him, and was not allowed: his manner of worſhiping was diuine. The iaylor fell downe before Paul and Silas in acknowledgement of ſome outward eminency in them, and was not reproued: his manner of worſhipping was meerely ciuill. The ſame geſture may be performed to different perſons with a different reſpect. A childe may kneele to his parent, and to the king. Yet it followeth not that he maketh his parent a king. Neither will it follow that by kneeling to his parent he maketh him a God, becauſe men kneele to God.
               
            
            
               §. 10. Of the vices contrary to childrens reuerend geſture towards their parents.
               
               Contrary to the forenamed branches of reuerend geſture, are, Vnreuerend geſtures of children.
               
               1. Rudeneſſe and vnmannerlineſſe, when children know not how to put difference betwixt their parents and ſtrangers, but can 1. Rudeneſſe.
                  
ſuffer their parents to come to them, and they abide in their place and not ſtirre to meet them.
               2. Diſdainfull ſtatelineſſe, when they thinke much to ſtand 2. Statelineſſe. bare-headed any while in their parents preſence. It falleth out many times, that when parents and children are together before their betters, they will ſhew more reuerence then theſe: for the father will ſtand, and be vncouered, when the ſonne ſitteth downe and puts on his hat, vpon conceit that his father doth more reuerence then is meet: but if it were ſo, yet the ſonne for the fathers ſake ſhould ſtoope ſomewhat the lower.
               3. Wantonneſſe and boldneſſe, when children are ouer-familiar 3. Boldneſſe. with their parents: toying and gigling vpon euery light occaſion. This kinde of cariage cannot but much tend to the diſgrace and diſhonour of parents. For what can they who behold it thinke, but that ſuch children haue beene too much cockered and ill nurtered?
               4. Ambition, when children are ſo ambitiouſly deſirous of place, 4. Ambition. eſpecially in companie, as rather then be vnder ſome whom they ſuppoſe to be at leaſt their equals, they will be aboue their parents. This oft falleth out, when parents being of a lowly minde, giue place to ſuch as their children, being of a lofty minde, thinke meaner then themſelues. Now rather then they will be vnder their inferiours (as they ſuppoſe) they will be aboue their parents. A point of great inſolencie. Such ought to be the reſpect of a childe to his parent, as he ſhould debaſe himſelfe below thoſe that are his inferiours, rather then exalt himſelfe aboue his parent. As with other men, for peace ſake, in many caſes, a man muſt depart from his right; ſo eſpecially with his parent, in caſe of ſuperioritie. Would not euery one that knowes what honour a childe owes to a father, condemne that childs ambition, that ſhould ſo ſtand vpon the place and hand, as to take them of his parent?
               5. An ouer-nice and erroneous opinion of thoſe, who thinke it 5. Refuſing to aske bleſſing. vnmeet for any childe to aske their parents bleſſing. Their owne conceit more ſwayeth them, then the continuali approued practiſe of Gods people in all ages: not vnlike him whom Solomon ſaith to be wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen men that can render 
                  
                     Pro. 26. 16. 
                  a reaſon. Others, though they doe not ſo generally disa
                     •
                  ow this

dutie, yet they thinke it meet only for yong children: not conſidering of what yeeres, ſtature, and ſtate, Ioſeph was, when he performed it.
               As for thoſe, who thinke it not vnlawfull, yet careleſly neglect it, they little conſider the benefit of a parents bleſſing. Profane Eſau ſhall another day riſe vp in iudgement againſt them. He 
                     Gen 27. 34. Heb. 12 17. beggd and beggd againe and againe, and that with a loud cry and ſalt teares, a bleſſing of his father.
               Thus much of childrens reuerence. Their obedience followeth.
            
            
               §. 11. Of childrens obedience.
               
               The obedience of children doth moſt proue the authoritie of parents, and is the ſureſt euidence of the honour a childe giueth to his parent: therefore is it 
                     Eph. 6. 1. Col. 3. 20. by name in the text expreſſed, and all other duties are compriſed vnder it. Reuerence without obedience is a meere mockage, nothing at all acceptable. Of the two, a childe were better faile in the former: inſtance the 
                     Matt. 21. 31. parable of the two ſonnes. Reuerence in compariſon of obedience is but a complementall honour. Obedience is a true reall honour; the ſureſt triall of a dutifull childe. Obedience is a dutie ſo proper to children, as the Apoſtle applieth it to them as a proper attribute, ſaying, 1 Pet. 1. 14. 
                  as obedient children faſhion not, &c. The example of Chriſt is herein ſet before vs as a patterne: 
                     Luk. 2. 5 1. 
                  he was ſubiect to his parents. Solomon counteth the neglect thereof a 
                     Pro. 23. 22. 
                  deſpiſing of a parent.
               Contrary is diſobedience and rebellion: the greateſt impeachment Diſobedience moſt contrary to parents authoritie. of parents authoritie that can be. For to what end is authoritie ouer thoſe who reſiſt it, and rebell againſt it? The 2 Tim. 3. 2. Apoſtle reckoneth diſobedient children among the lewdeſt perſons that be: and ſetteth forth their diſobedience by 
                     Tit 1. 6. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . a metaphor taken from vntamed, head-ſtrong beaſts, that will not be brought vnder the yoke: the word therefore is not vnfitly tranſlated vnruly: and it is ſomewhat anſwerable to an 
                     Deut. 13. 13.

                  it, ſonnes without yoke, that is, ſuch children, as refuſing to be in ſubiection vnto parents, are no way profitable, but worke much

miſchiefe, and cauſe great griefe. The 
                     Deut. 21. 18, &c.

               §. 12. Of childrens forbearing to doe things without conſent of parents.
               
               That children may the better know their dutie in this reſpect, The parts of a childs obedience. I will diſtinctly ſet forth, both the parts, and alſo the extent of a childs obedience:

                     1. Wherein it conſiſteth.
                     2. How farre it extendeth.
                  
               
               The generall parts wherein it conſiſteth are two:
               1. A forbearance from doing things without conſent of parents. Of the ſeuerall wayes whereby conſent may be giuen, ſee Treat. 3.
               
               2. A performance of ſuch things as parents will haue done.
               The former of theſe is a dutie whereunto children are muſt bound while they are vnder their parents gouernment. For that §. 19. Num. 30. 17. time the conſent of parents is not only meet, but neceſſarie: and that for theſe reaſons.
               1. Children are as the goods of their parents, wholly in their power, to be ordered and diſpoſed by them. On this ground Satan hauing all that Iob had put into his hand, tooke libertie ouer 
                     Iob 1. 12, 19. his children as well as ouer his goods and chattell.
               2. Children while they be vnder gouernment, (euen the eldeſt that are heires) differ nothing from ſeruants. 
                     Galat. 4. 1.
               
               3. By Gods law giuen to the Iewes, parents had power to ſell 
                     Exod. 21. 7. their children.
               4. Parents had power to diſanull ſuch things as children had done. Inſtance the caſe of a vow made to God, which was one of 
                     Num. 30. 4. the moſt inuiolable things that one could doe.
               Contrary is the opinion and practiſe of many, who hold parents conſent at the moſt but a matter of conueniencie: that it is good, if children will, to haue their parents conſent: if they haue it not, the matter is not great: their contracts or other things which they doe, are as firme, and good, without, as with their conſents. If this were ſo, wherein is the authoritie of a parent more then of a wiſe experienced friend? It is meet, and good to haue ſuch an ones conſent.
               But that the power of parents, and dutie of children in this

point, may the better be ſeene, I will exemplifie it in fiue particular caſes. 1. Entring into a calling. 2. Making mariage. 3. Diſpoſing of goods. 4. Ordering apparell. 5. Making vowes.
            
            
               §. 13. Of conſent of parents for childrens entring into a calling.

               §. 14. Of the vnlawfulneſſe of childrens entring into religious orders without conſent of parents.
               
               Contrary is the opinion of Papiſts, who ſay, that children may 36. Licet filijs ingredi religionem inuitis parentibus.

                  nſt the minde and good like of their parents. Whereby they 
                     〈◊〉
                   not only patronize apparent diſobedience in children, againſt

the expreſſe word of God; but alſo diſable children from helping their parents in caſe of neceſſitie: for both which Chriſt rebuked the Scribes and Phariſies in a like caſe.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Papiſts doe grant that if parents be in ſuch neceſſitie, Conditio eſt, vt parentes non ſint in tali neceſſitate, vt ſine ſiliorum auxilio viuere non poſſint. Tunc enim tenentur ex praecepto Dei parentibus adeſſe. Bellarm. loc. cit. as they cannot liue without their childrens helpe, their children may not by entring into any religious order forſake their parents. For they are bound by the law of God to ſuccour their parents.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. This caution hath beene extorted from them by euidence of argument taken from Gods word, and preſſed by their aduerſaries.
                  2. It toucheth not the principall argument taken from Gods precept, which they make of none effect by this their tradition.
                  3. Though parents be not at that preſent, when children firſt enter into their religious order, in ſuch extreme need, yet they may be afterwards. But after that children are once entred, they hold it vtterly vnlawfull that children for any neceſſitie of the parent, ſhould attend vpon them for their ſuccour.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Children being entred into religious orders may Eos iuvant quomodo religioſos decet, nimirum precibus apud Deum. Bellarm. ibid. helpe them, as becommeth religious perſons, by their praiers to God.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. This is iumpe the Phariſies Corban, whereof Chriſt maketh mention, Mar. 7. 11. and whereby he notably diſcouereth the hypocriſie of the Phariſies, who made pretence of religion, an hinderance to that obedience which God required of children.
                  2. To pray for that which a man indeuoureth not to doe, when he may doe it, is a plaine mocking of God.
                  The arguments which they alledge for confirmation of their erroneous opinion, are taken from extraordinary examples, or from myſticall reſemblances, as

                        1. Abrahams leauing his fathers houſe. 
                              Gen. 12. 1. Deut. 33. 9.

                           houſe.
                        
                        
                           
4. The triall of our loue of Chriſt by louing him more 
                              Mat. 10. 37. then father or mother.
                        5. Chriſts forbidding one that followed him to goe and 
                              Luk. 9. 60. burie his father.
                     
                  
                  
                     Anſw. 1. For Abrahams example, 1. it cannot be proued that he left his fathers houſe without the conſent of his father. 2. He was then maried, and ſo of another houſe. 3. He had 
                        Gen. 12. 1. an expreſſe particular charge of God to leaue his fathers houſe, euen as he had to ſacrifice his ſonne. Except the like charge can be ſhewed, his example maketh nothing to the purpoſe.
                  2. For Leuies ſpeech, 1. It was noted by Moſes in relation 
                        Exo. 32. 26, &c.
                      to a particular zealous fact of the Leuites in executing the vengeance of the Lord, and ſo to be reckoned among ſuch extraordinary things as are not exemplary. 2. That which moued the Leuites to make no difference betwixt their parents and others, was the Lords cauſe: their parents and kindred as well as others had notoriouſly ſinned againſt God, and in that reſpect the Leuites took no notice of them. But they are not ſuch parents which Papiſts teach children to forſake, but any parents. Now what conſequence is this; Some children haue been Gods Miniſters in executing iuſt puniſhment on their wicked parents, therefore children may enter into ſuch places as ſhall exempt them from helping any parents, though well deſeruing? 3. The Leuites had an expreſſe charge for that which they did: but that which Papiſts inferre from their 
                        Exo. 32. 27. example doth make the commandement of God of none effect. 
                        Mat. 15. 6.
                  
                  3. For the 
                        Pſal. 45. 10. aduice to the Queene, 1. It is myſtically to be taken. 2. If it ſhould be literally taken, it is to be taken as giuen to her after mariage, when ſhe was out of her parents gouernment. 3. It hath relation to the 
                        Gen. 2. 24. law of mariage, 
                        •
                     nd implieth not a ſimple forſaking of parents, but a preferring of a husband before them.
                  4. For the louing of father and mother more then Chriſt, 
                        〈◊〉
                     . It doth not neceſſarily imply a forſaking of our parents: 
                        •
                     or we may loue Chriſt more then them, and yet performe 
                        •
                     uty to them. 2. If they be forſaken, it muſt be in oppoſition

to Chriſt, that either Chriſt or they muſt be forſaken, in that if we cleaue to them they will draw vs from Chriſt.
                  5. For Chriſts forbidding one that followed him to goe and burie his father: 1. It was becauſe of an extraordinary calling which he had. 2. It is ſet downe as a patterne to Miniſters, to ſhew that they ſhould eſpecially attend vpon their proper function, and leaue other ſecular matters to be performed by ſuch as can performe them well enough. To apply it to childrens forſaking of parents, is to peruert the ſenſe of it.
                  Thus we ſee to how little purpoſe the forenamed arguments are alledged to proue that erronious opinion of childrens entring into religious orders without their parents conſent. I might further ſhew how irreligious their pretended religious orders be, and ſo ſhew how vnlawfull it is to enter into them, euen with conſent of parents: but that maketh nothing to the point in hand.
               
            
            
               §. 15. Of the vnlawfulneſſe of childrens trauelling, and binding themſelues prentiſes without conſent of parents.
               
               Contrary alſo to the forenamed part of childrens obedience, is the practiſe of ſuch children as trauell, and ſeeke their fortunes (as they ſpeake) without conſent of parents, like the Prodigall childe, if not worſe: for it is likely that he forced 
                     Luk. 15. 12, &c.
                   from his father a generall conſent, in that he obtained of him his portion of goods. Theſe vſually bring great griefe to their parents, and many times make them feare more then is cauſe, as old Iaakob feared, when he knew not what was become of 
                     Gen. 37. 35. his ſonne.
               Among thoſe aberrations may be reckoned a cuſtome in this land more vſuall then lawfull, for children to binde themſelues prentiſes without conſent of parents: to which fault they who take indentures of ſuch children, or otherwiſe couenant with them without knowledge of their parents conſent, make themſelues acceſſary. Arguments to proue that children may not marie without parents conſent.
               
            
            
               §. 16. Of parents conſent to the mariage of their children.
               
               II. That children ought to haue their parents conſent vnto their mariage is without all queſtion euident. For
               1. God himſelfe hath giuen vs herein a patterne: He firſt

brought the woman to the man (Gen. 2. 22.) whereby he would ſhew that he who gaue a being to the woman, had a right to diſpoſe her in mariage: which right parents now haue: for from them vnder God, children receiue their being. In this caſe parents ſtand in Gods roome, and are as it were Gods hand to ioyne their children in mariage.
               2. God hath giuen expreſſe lawes concerning this point. To omit that generall morall law, Honour thy father and thy mother (which, as it is the ground of all other duties appertaining to children, ſo of this alſo) the authoritie and charge which God by his law (Deut. 7. 3) hath laid vpon parents, to giue their daughters to husbands, and to take wiues for their ſonnes, hath the force of a law to binde children from taking wiues or husbands, without or againſt their parents conſent. This law was not proper to the Iewes only; but as a branch of the morall law it is preſſed vpon Chriſtians, 1 Cor. 7. 36. 37.
               To this may be added the iudiciall law (if it be to be accounted meerely iudiciall) of a parents power in giuing his daughter, or refuſing to giue her in mariage to him that had defloured her, Exo. 22. 17.
               3. Anſwerable to the law hath beene the practiſe of Gods Saints recorded and approued in Scripture. Iſaak married the wife which his father prouided (Gen. 24. 67.) Iaakob both obeyed his father in going to Labans houſe for a wife (Gen. 28. 2.) and alſo when he came to Laban asked his daughter of him (Gen. 29. 18. &c.)
               Though Sampſon ſaw a daughter of the Philiſtims which

               4. Theſe words of Thamar (2 Sam. 13. 13.) Speake vnto the King (who was her father,) for he will not with-hold thee from me, ſhew that children were not wont to be married without conſent of parents: Which is further confirmed by this oath of the Iſraelites, There ſhall not any of vs giue his daughter

                   heathen haue obſerued the equity hereof. Though Shechem loued Dinah, and had defloured her, yet would he not mary her without the conſent of his and her father, Gen. 34, 3. &c. Iſmael had learned as much either by the inſtruction he had receiued out of Abrahams houſe, or elſe by the light of nature; for he ſtood to the choice which his mother made for him, Gen. 21. 21.

Experience hath manifeſted the boldneſſe of many children in ſetting light by their parents conſent in thoſe places where mariages once conſummated are ratified,

Children for the moſt part being heady and raſh for want of experience; and ſeeking more to ſatisfie their preſent carnall deſire, then to prouide a good laſting helpe for themſelues: but parents by the inſtinct of nature louing their children as well as children loue themſelues, and hauing by much experience better vnderſtanding of a meete helpe, and better able to vſe their diſcerning gift in this caſe, becauſe it is not their owne caſe, and yet the caſe of one whom they loue as themſelues, and to whom they wiſh as much good as to themſelues; is it not meete euen for the childs good, that in a matter of ſuch moment as mariage, the parent ſhould haue a ſtroake?
            
            
               §. 18. Of a childs cariage in caſe a parent prouide an vnfit mate or none at all.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. What if parents vrge their children to marry ſuch Whether parents may force their children to marry, or no. as they can not affect and loue: muſt children therein againſt their minde and liking yeeld obedience?
                  
                     Anſw. If there be no iuſt exception againſt the partie commended, they ought with the vttermoſt of their power to endeauour See Treat. 6. §. 54. to bring their affection to the bent of their parents will: and as an helpe thereunto, be perſwaded that their parents are as carefull of their good as they themſelues are, and

wiſer then themſelues: yea aboue all they ought to make inſtant prayer vnto God (in whoſe hand mans heart is to turne it 
                     
                        Prou. 21. 1. 
                     whither ſoeuer he will) that he would be pleaſed to alter the courſe of their affection, and to ſettle it on the party whom their parent hath choſen for them; if at leaſt they ſee no iuſt cauſe to the contrary. But if notwithſtanding all the meanes that they can vſe, they ſtill finde their heart altogether auerſe, they may in a reuerend manner entreat their parent to forbeare to preſſe that match, and to thinke of ſome other.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. What if the parent be negligent, and in due time prouide no fit match, may not the childe prouide one for himſelfe?
                  
                     Anſw. A parents negligence is not a ſufficient pretext to make a child caſt off that ſubiection which he oweth to his parent. Yet I deny not but that a childe knowing where a fit match is to be had, may make knowne as much to his parent (as Sampſon did) and craue both his conſent and help thereunto. 
                        Iudg. 14. 2. And if his parent giue no eare to his humble ſuit, he may vſe the mediation of his kindred or other friends. Yea if neceſſity require that the childe be married, and his parent adde wilfulneſſe to negligence, and will not be moued at all, neither by the humble ſuit of his childe, nor by the earneſt ſolicitation of any friends, meanes may be made to the Magiſtrate (who is in Gods place ouer the parent as well as ouer 
                        Qui liberos iniuria prohibuerint ducere vx eres vel nubere, per praeſides cogantur in matrimonium collocare Di eſt. lib. 23. tit. 2. § 19. the childe, and ought to afford releefe vnto the childe) and what the Magiſtrate doth in that caſe is as good a warrant to the childe as if the parent had done it.
                  The like meanes may be vſed if a parent be an Idolater, Hereticke, or Atheiſt, and will not yeeld that his childe be married to any but to one of his owne profeſſion and diſpoſition.
               
            
            
               §. 19. Of the ſinne of Children in marrying without their parents conſent.
               
               Contrary is the minde and practiſe of ſuch children as ouer lightly eſteeming their parents power, take matches of their owne choice: and that ſometimes priuily without giuing any notice at all to their parents: and ſometimes moſt rebelliouſly againſt their parents mind and charge: not much vnlike thoſe

who in the old world are condemned for taking wiues of all that 
                  
                     Gen. 6. 2. 
                  they choſe (which was one branch of that wickedneſſe for which the world was drowned) or rather like Eſau who tooke 
                     Gen. 26. 35. ſuch wiues as proued a griefe to his parents. What bleſſing can be expected to fall vpon ſuch mariages? or rather what curſe may not be feared to follow them? Gods law is tranſgreſſed thereby: his Image in parents deſpiſed, that which is more proper to them then any goods; or fraudulently, or violently taken from them: their ſoules grieued thereat: and they See more miſchiefes following ſuch mariages, §. 21. oft prouoked to caſt off their children, and curſe their mariages. Now Gods curſe doth oft follow the iuſt curſe of a parent.
            
            
               §. 20. Of obiections for childrens marrying without parents conſent, anſwered.
               
               
                  1. Obiect. Though Iaakob married one wife according to his parents direction, yet he married other three (at leaſt the two maides) without their conſent.
                  1. Anſw. Iaakobs example in marrying more wiues then one is not iuſtifiable.
                  2. Anſw. Iaakob had a generall conſent of his parents to 
                        Gen. 28. 2. take a wife of the daughters of Laban: if therefore his marying of two wiues had beene lawfull, neither this nor that daughter had beene taken without all conſent of his parents. As for the two maids of whom he had children, neither of them was his wife: for long after they had children they are called his maids,

                  2. Obiect. Seruants may mary without their maſters conſent: why then not children without their parents?
                  1. Anſw. 
                     See Treat. 8. §. 17. It is not lawfull for ſeruants ſo to doe while the

                     ower ouer his childe, then a maſter ouer his ſeruant. The

                     ower which a maſter hath is by a mutuall couenant betwixt him and his ſeruant, and by the voluntary ſubiection of a ſer
                     
                        •
                     ant vnto his maſter. But the power of a parent is by the bond of nature, in that a childe hath his being from his parents. Be
                     
                        •
                     ides, this ſubiection of a childe to his parents in caſe of marriage,

is not for ſeruitude but See the third reaſon in §. 17. for the good of the childe.
               
               
                  3. Obiect. Children marry for themſelues and not for their parents, why then ſhould parents conſent be ſo much ſtood vpon?
                  1. Anſw. Though they marie not for their parents, yet they marie See the ſecond reaſon in §. 17. Pſal. 127. 3. 
                     from their parents: by mariage they are freed from the power of their parents.
                  2. Anſw. Children are not their owne: they are the inheritance of the Lord: the Lord hath giuen them to parents as an inheritance: a childe therefore may no more marry for himſelfe without conſent of parents, then alienate his parents goods for himſelfe.
               
            
            
               §. 21. Of ſtealing children from parents for mariage ſake.
               
               To the §. 19. forenamed ſinne, and to the vengeance thereof, doe they make themſelues acceſſary, who fraudulently allure, or violently take away children to marry them otherwiſe then their parents would. This is a worſe kinde of felony then ſtealing away the goods of a man. For children are much more properly a mans owne, then his goods: and dearer to him then any goods can be: yea and ſo much more highly to be eſteemed, by how much reaſonable creatures are to be preferred before ſenſeleſſe, and ſenſuall things. Our 
                     Anno 4. & 5. Phil. & Mar. ſtat. 8. ſtatute law expreſly condemneth this, and impoſeth a ſeuere puniſhment on ſuch as ſhall offend therein. And iuſtly doe ſuch offenders deſerue to be ſeuerely puniſhed, both in regard of the heinouſneſſe of the ſinne, and alſo in regard of the many Miſchiefes ariſing from marriages without parents conſent. miſchiefes which follow thereon, as, Alienation of parents affection from their children, Diſinheriting heires, Enmity betwixt the friends of each party ſo married, Litigious ſuits in law, Ruine of families, and (if the perſonages, whoſe children are married without their parents conſent, be great and noble) Diſturbance of whole townes, cities, and nations.

               §. 22. Of miniſters ſinne in marying children without parents conſent.
               
               Such miniſters alſo as through Careleſneſſe, not taking due

account of the parties whom they marie, whether they haue their parents conſent or no; or through bribery, being hired by reward, doe marie ſuch children as they know haue not their parents conſent; doe in an high degree make themſelues acceſſary to the §. 19. forenamed ſinne. Their fact is as bad as the fact of the principals themſelues. Their ſolemnization of ſuch mariages emboldneth both the parties that are ſo maried, and alſo all the perſons that are preſent thereat. They highly diſhonour Gods holy ordinance, in that bearing the perſon of God they ſay of ſuch as God hath forbidden to be ſo ioyned together, Thoſe whom God hath ioyned together let no man put aſunder. If miniſters had not their hand in ſuch vnlawfull mariages, they could not be made: for our Church ratifieth no mariage but what is made by a miniſter. Wherefore ſome miniſter or other is guilty of this foule ſinne, whenſoeuer any childe is maried without conſent of parents. Well therefore doth our Church (to preuent this ſinne) expreſly forbid miniſters to marie any without parents conſent: and inflict a ſeuere cenſure on them that ſhall offend therein.
            
            
               §. 23. Of childrens forbearing to diſpoſe any of their parents goods without conſent.
               
               A third branch of the ſubiection of children in forbearing to doe any thing without their parents conſent, is about their parents goods.
               
               That children though liuing in their parents houſe, ought not without their parents conſent to diſpoſe their goods, is euident by the extent of their obedience, in all things.
               
               In that Iſaak was pleaſed to ſend Iaakob to Padan Aram without any great prouiſion, it ſeemeth that Iaakob made conſcience of taking any thing priuily, but went as his father ſent him 
                     Gen. 32. 10. 
                  with his ſtaffe. And the 
                     Gen. 31. 36. apology which he made to Laban his father in law concerning things taken away, ſheweth that he held it vnlawfull for children priuily to conuey 
                     •
                  way their parents goods. What is my treſpaſſe? what is my ſinne? (ſaith he) what haſt thou found of all my houſhold-ſtuffe?
               
               Doth he not hereby imply, that if Labans daughters had 
                     •
                  aken away any of their fathers goods, it had beene a treſpaſſe 
                     •
                  nd ſinne?
               
                  
The Apoſtle ſaith of the heire (who of all the children may 
                     Reaſons. 1. Children vnder parents are as ſeruants. ſeeme to haue the greateſt right) that as long as he is a childe (that is, vnder the gouernment of his parents) he differeth nothing from a ſeruant, though he be Lord of all. If he differ not from a ſeruant, what right can he haue at his pleaſure 
                     Gal. 4. 1. to diſpoſe his parents goods? Hath a ſeruant any ſuch right?
               It is very requiſite that children herein ſhould be tied to their parents conſent, both for the good of parents, and of children themſelues.
               
                  Of parents, that they may know what they haue, or haue 2. Good of parents. not, and accordingly order their expences. How can parents tell what they haue, if children priuily without their knowledge purloin and diſpoſe their goods?
               
                  Of children, that their lauiſh humor might by this meanes 3. Good of children. be reſtrained: (for youth is much prone beyond moderation to ſpend, if it haue wherewithall) and that their parents may the better lay vp for them.

               §. 24. Of the ſinne of children in purloining and waſting their parents goods.
               
               Contrary is both the opinion and practiſe of many It is a ſinne for children. children.
               For opinion, many thinke and ſay, that whatſoeuer is their 1. To mutter at their parents allowance. parents, is theirs alſo: and thereupon being through the watchfull eie and prouident care of their parents reſtrained from ouerlauiſh ſpending, or from laying out any thing with their owne hands, they murmure againſt that reſtraint.
               Knowledge and perſwaſion of their ſubiection in this caſe, would be a good meanes to ſuppreſſe that repining humour.
               For practiſe, 
                  2. Priuily to purloine their parents goods. Gen. 31. 19. Who counſell children to conuey away parents goods are acceſſary to theft.
               
               1. Some priuily take away and purloine what goods, money, wares or any thing elſe they can come by of their parents. This the holy Ghoſt accounteth plaine theft: for Rachel hauing priuily taken away her fathers idolls, the Scripture ſaith that ſhe ſtole them.
               
               Hereunto doe they make themſelues acceſſary, who counſell and incourage children ſo to doe: as many buſibodies, and deceitfull perſons aduiſe daughters, when God hath taken

away their mothers, to take away linnen, and other-like houſhold-ſtuffe from their father, pretending that their father may marie another wife, who will carrie all away: And vpon like pretence alſo perſwade ſons when their fathers die, to conuey away what they can from their mother. But ſuch pretences are no ſufficient warrant vnto children to deceiue their parents. It were better for children to be depriued of their parents goods, then to enioy them with ſuch deceit: for they will be like that bread which is ſweet to a man, and afterward his 
                  
                     Pro. 20. 17. 
                  mouth is filled with grauell.
               
               2. Others riotouſly ſpend their portion, like the prodigall 3. Waſtfully to ſpend. Luk. 15. 13. childe, and runne into debt, and ſo make their parents either to pay it, or to leaue them to the law. Many Schollers at the Vniuerſities, Gentlemen at Innes of Court, and ſuch children as are ſomewhat liberally trained vp in their parents, or other friends houſes, doe much offend herein. Little doth this exceſſe and riot differ from the forenamed kinde of theft: and ordinarily it bringeth as many miſchiefes as that doth.
               3. Some alſo be ſo vngracious and vngratefull, that being 4. To defeat their parents of their goods cunningly. come to yeeres, and their parents growne old, ſeeke to defeat their parents of all they haue, and to bring their parents vnder them, to be ordered by them: labouring to get poſſeſſion of all before their parents be dead, or before they be willing to reſigne any ſuch right vnto their children. Such were 2 Sam. 15. 10. &c.
                   
                  Abſolom, and Adoniah. How highly diſpleaſing ſuch practiſes are to God, the vengeance which fell vpon the pates of 1 King. 1. 5. &c.
                   thoſe two Brethren in euill, traiterous, and diſloyall children, doth ſhew.
               All ſuch children as ſeeke after the forenamed, or any other like meanes to defraud their parents, doe very ill repay their parents care ouer them, and more like Barbarians, then Chriſtians, recompence euill for good: they oft bring pouerty and ignominy vpon their parents and themſelues: they are worſe then other theeues, becauſe they are more deerely accounted of, and more freely truſted: yea they are a very bad example to ſeruants in the houſe, or ſubiects in the commonwealth.
            
            
               
               §. 25. Of childrens contentedneſſe to be apparelled after their parents minde and liking.
               
               IIII. A fourth branch of the foreſaid ſubiection of children is about their apparell, that it be no other, then may ſtand with their parents good liking. It is noted that Iſrael 
                  
                     Gen. 37. 3. 
                  made Ioſeph a coat, doth not the particular mentioning of that circumſtance ſhew, that parents muſt haue the ordering of their childrens apparell? Which is alſo intimated in the reaſon giuen of Tamars garment of diuers colours, namely becauſe 2 Sam. 13. 18. 
                  with ſuch garments were the kings daughters, that were virgins, apparelled. And whereas Rebekah had the keeping of her 
                     Gen. 27. 15. ſonne Eſaus clothes, it appeareth that his clothes were to the minde of his parents: elſe he would haue hid them from them: for further confirmation whereof it is noted that his apparell was pleaſing to his father.
               Contrary is the vaine-glorious humour of many children, Childrens ſin in apparelling themſelues to the griefe, and diſgrace of their parents. who to the griefe and diſcredit of their parents, apparell themſelues both againſt the minde, and alſo aboue the ability, and vnbeſeeming the place and calling of their parents. Among others, many miniſters children bring much diſcredit on their parents hereby. Let all ſuch proud Youths note how the Lord hath threatned to viſit euen Kings children that are clothed 
                  
                     Zeph. 1. 8. 
                  with ſtrange apparell.
               
            
            
               §. 26. Of childrens forbearing to binde themſelues to doe any thing againſt their parents conſent.
               
               V. The fift and laſt branch wherewith I will exemplifie the forenamed ſubiection of children, ſhall be that which is expreſly noted in the law, namely a childes binding of it ſelfe by a vow.
               The law giueth the parent power to diſanull his childes 
                     Num. 30. 4. vow. It is therefore a childes dutie to abſtaine from vowing without his parents conſent.
               Contrary are ſuch vowes as Papiſts allure children to make, Vnlawfull vowes of children. namely, vowes of continencie, perpetuall virginitie, regular obedience, voluntarie pouertie, with the like.
               Though by theſe they be not drawne to forſake their parents (which §. 14. before we proued to be vtterly vnlawfull:) and though theſe in their nature were lawfull (which they are not, becauſe

they are againſt Gods law and ordinance, and againſt Chriſtian libertie, and ſauour too rankly of Iudaiſme, yea of a worſe ſuperſtition,) yet without parents conſent might they not be made.
               As vnlawfull are oaths, and other like meanes, whereby children binde themſelues to the performance of ſuch indifferent things, as their parents are not willing they ſhould doe. What doth this but bring a ſnare vpon the conſciences of children, and cauſe a neceſſitie of breaking one of Gods commandements? either the third, in breaking their vow or oath; or the fift, in diſobeying their parents.
            
            
               §. 27. Of childrens actiue obedience.
               
               The affirmatiue and actiue part of a childs obedience, conſiſts in yeelding himſelfe pliable to his parents will; which muſt be added to the forenamed negatiue and paſſiue part of obedience in forbearing to doe things without conſent of parents, for manifeſtation of a true child-like affection and diſpoſition toward the parent. Paſſiue obedience may ariſe from meere fullenneſſe, and ſtoutneſſe of ſtomach. For there are many who will forbeare to doe this or that without conſent of parents, becauſe they are loth to aske their conſent: they had rather haue their owne wills croſt in the things they deſire, then be made ſubiect to their parents will. What doth this argue, but a ſtout ſtomach, and a diſdainfull heart? Beſides, to forbeare the doing of an vnlawfull thing, is but to abſtaine from euill. But it is required of Chriſtians 
                     Pſal. 34. 14. to doe that which is good, as well as to abſtaine from that which is euill. This is it which is commended in Iaakob: he did not only forbeare to take ſuch a wife as would be a griefe to his parents (wherein his 
                     Gen. 26. 34, 35. brother Eſau had offended) but alſo obeyed his parents in 
                     Gen. 28. 2. & 29. 18. taking ſuch a wife as they willed him to take.
               This generall point we will exemplifie in foure particular inſtances, namely, in a childs obedience to his parents commandements, inſtructions, reproofes, corrections.
               
            
            
               §. 28. Of childrens obedience to their parents commandements.
               
               I. What lawfull commandements ſoeuer parents giue to their children, they muſt be ready to the vttermoſt of their power to obey. 
                     Epheſ. 6. 1. 
                  Obey your parents, ſaith the Apoſtle to children.
               
                  
Parents, by vertue of their place, haue power and authoritie to command: Children therefore muſt obey, or elſe that power is to no purpoſe.
               To demonſtrate this by ſome particulars:
               1. If a parent call his childe, or ſend for him, he muſt readily A childe muſt come at the parents call. come, yea though he know not the occaſion. Eli was in place of a parent to Samuel, whereupon the childe ſuppoſing that Eli called him, 1 Sam. 3. 5, &c.
                   ranne to him once, and againe and againe. 
                     & 16. 12. 
                  Dauid when he was ſent for by his father out of the field to be anointed King, knew not the occaſion, yet came. 
                     Gen. 49. 1. The twelue ſonnes of Iaakob, though men growne, yet called for by their father, aſſembled themſelues together before him.
               2. If a parent be diſpoſed to ſend his childe any whither, or of A childe muſt goe at his parents word. any errand, though it be farre off, and may ſeeme ſomewhat troubleſome, yet he ought to goe, and doe it. The §. 27. forenamed example of 
                     Gen. 28. 5. 
                  Iaakob, the example alſo of 
                     & 37. 14. 
                  Ioſeph (being ſent to ſee whether it were well with his brethren) and of the 
                     & 42. 2, 3. 
                  tenne ſonnes of Iaakob (being ſent by their father into Egypt,) and of 1 Sam. 17. 17, 
                  Dauid (ſent to viſit his brethren in the hoſte) are in this caſe commended by the holy Ghoſt. Of Dauid it is noted, that 20. he aroſe vp early and went as Iſhai had commanded him: which ſetteth forth his ready obedience.
               3. If a parent require his childe to attend vpon him, he muſt A childe at command muſt attend vpon the parent. alſo doe that. When Abram was going vp to the top of Moriah his will was that his ſeruants ſhould tarrie behinde, and that his ſonne Iſaak ſhould attend him, and carry the wood for the ſacrifice, and accordingly Iſaak obeyed. 
                     Gen. 22. 6.
               
               4. If a parent inioyne any taske, or commit any buſineſſe to A child muſt do the meſſage his parent will haue him doe. his childe, he ought faithfully to performe it. This kinde of faithfull obedience is commended in 
                     Gen. 50. 5. 
                  Ioſeph, in the 
                     Ier. 35. 8. 
                  Rechabites, and in 1 Sam. 17. 20. 
                  Dauid, with many others. Ioſeph, by reaſon of his great place, might not goe out of Egypt, yet to performe that which his father inioyned him, he asked leaue. The Rechabites were tempted to breake their fathers charge, yet they would not. Dauid when he was ſent by his father, from the ſheepe which were committed to his cuſtodie, was carefull to leaue them with a keeper: 
                  1 Sam. 17. 20. and againe, when a Beare at one time, and a Lion at another came 
                     verſ. 34. to the flocke, he put his life in hazard to preſerue the flocke: all

theſe circumſtances are thus noted, to ſet forth the great care that theſe children had to diſcharge that charge which their parents had committed to them.
            
            
               §. 29. Of childrens diſobedience to their parents commandements.
               
               Contrary is a rebellious diſpoſition in children, manifeſted by theſe and ſuch like practiſes,
               1. By refuſing to be at their parents call; or comming (as we ſpeake) at leiſure, and making their parents wait for them.
               2. By a lazie, ſluggiſh pretending of vaine and friuolous excuſes, when their parents would ſend them of an errand, like that ſluggard, who ſaith, 
                     Prou. 22. 13. 
                  A lion is without, I ſhall be ſlaine in the ſtreets. Such pretences are as 
                     & 10. 26. 
                  vineger to the teeth, and ſmoke to the eyes.
               
               3. By ſcorning to wait on their parents; and in that reſpect they will ſlinke out of doores, and abſent themſelues, when they imagine their parents will vſe their ſeruice in that kinde: they forſooth will not be their parents ſeruants: and impious conceit.
               4. By refuſing to doe what their parents inioyne them to doe, and require at their hands, like 
                     Matt. 21. 30. the younger ſonne, that went not to worke in the vineyard at his fathers command. Such children for the moſt part offend herein, as through pride thinke the buſineſſe inioyned to them too meane, and baſe to doe. Had Dauid, or the daughters of Reguel beene of this minde, the one would 1 Sam. 16. 13, 21. & 17. 15. not haue returned to his fathers ſheepe, after he was anointed to be King ouer Iſrael, and after he had beene called to the Court; and the other would not haue watered their fathers ſheepe, eſpecially 
                     Exo. 2. 16, 17. among ſuch rude and bioſterous clownes, as without all reſpect to their place and ſex, would driue them away.
            
            
               §. 30. Of childrens obedience to their parents inſtruction.
               
               II. Such wholſome inſtructions as parents giue their children for the well ordering of their cariage, children ought conſcionably 
                     •
                  o obey: a point which 
                     Pro. 1. 8. 9. & 4. 1. 
                  Solomon much preſſeth: My ſonne, ſaith 
                     •
                  he, heare the inſtruction of thy father, and forſake not the law of thy another, &c. And to moue children the rather to doe ſo, he ſets before them 
                     Pro. 4. 3. his owne example, ſhewing that he required no more of them then himſelfe had performed. 
                     Exo. 18. 24. 
                  Moſes, though growne to yeeres, and a prince among his people, teſtified his obedience to his father in law hereby.
               
                  
1. Parents haue an expreſſe commandement to inſtruct their Reaſons. 1. Parents ought to inſtruct. children (as we ſhall Treat. 6. after ſhew.) Great reaſon therefore that their children heare and obey them therein. The good inſtructions of any one are to be regarded, much more of parents.
               2. Great wiſdome may be attained thereby: for the deſire that §. 26, &c.
                   parents haue of their childrens good, maketh them giue the beſt 2. Children get much wiſdome thereby. directions they can vnto them, euen what themſelues haue learned of others, or obſerued by their owne experience: in this reſpect, Solomon ſtileth him 
                     Prou. 13. 1. 
                  a wiſe ſonne that obeyeth the inſtruction of his father: and reſembleth the fruit and benefit thereof, to 
                     Prou. 1. 9. & 4. 9. 
                  acomely ornament, to chaines, and bracelets, and to a crowne of glory.
               
               3. Much ioy and comfort is brought to parents by ſeeing 3. Much ioy is brought to parents. their children obſerue their inſtruction: for 
                     Prou. 10. 1. 
                  a wiſe ſonne maketh a
                        •
                     glad father. Now this is a thing which children ought to aime at, 
                     Prou. 27. 11. 
                  to reioyce their parents heart. Eſau is taxed for 
                     Gen. 26. 35. 
                  grieuing his parents.
               Contrary is their proud and fooliſh humour, who thinke they need no inſtruction, their parents are too iealous of them, they are wiſe enough of themſelues; if their parents would but let them alone, they ſhould doe better: thus they ſhew themſelues impious againſt God, rebellious againſt their parents, and iniurious to themſelues. Such were 1 Sam. 2. 25. 
                  Elies, and 
                     Gen. 19. 14. 
                  Lots ſonnes. Now note the vengeance that fell vpon them.
            
            
               §. 31. Of childrens patience to their parents reproofe.
               
               III. The obedience of children muſt further Treat. 3. §. 47, &c. 
                  The reaſons alledged, and the directions giuen concerning a wiues ſubiection to her husbands reproofe, may fitly be applied to this part of childrens obedience. Here therefore the ſame order is obſerued, and the ſeuerall points confirmed by proofes pertinent to children. extend it ſelf to their parents reproofe: and that by patient bearing all manner of reproofes, and by amending what is iuſtly reproued. That ſhame, whereof the Lord ſpeaketh, which ſhould be in a childe, 
                     Num. 12. 14. when her father hath ſpet in her face, that is, by ſome outward ſigne manifeſted his anger, implieth a childs patient bearing of a parents reproofe. This patience in a childe muſt be manifeſted

to his parent, whether his reproofe be milde or bitter, iuſt or vniuſt. In this reſpect a childe muſt more conſider the perſon who reproueth, then the matter or manner of the reproofe. Iaakobs reproofe of Ioſeph, for his dreames which came of God, was vniuſt: 
                     Gen. 37. 10. the manner of vttering it, with many ſhort pauſes, and that interrogatiuely, implieth ſome tartneſſe: yet ſuch was his patience, as we read not of one diſcontented word that he gaue. But moſt memorable is the patience of Ionathan in this kinde. His father Sauls 
                  1 Sam. 20. 30, &c.
                   reproofe of him was directly vniuſt, and out of meaſure bitter: yet with what patience did he beare it? all that he replied was to make ſome little apologie for Dauid: he replied nothing againſt his fathers opprobrious ſpeeches.
               Great wiſdome may be learned by this patience: for ſo may a 
                     Reaſon. Wiſdome learned. childe better iudge of his parents reproofe, whether it be iuſt or no. Though it be vniuſt, yet thereby may he obſerue what is diſpleaſing to his parents: at leaſt he may obſerue his parents infirmitie, and ſo know the better how to carry himſelfe towards them.
               Contrary is the practiſe of ſuch children, as vpon euery reproofe of their parents are ready to * anſwer againe. Our parents See. §. 6. are wayward, ſay they, who can beare them? If none elſe could beare them, yet ſhould children: for parents ordinarily beare ſuch waywardneſſe, and vntowardneſſe at their childrens hands, eſpecially while they are young, as none elſe would or could.
               
                  
                     Queſt. If a parent be miſtaken in a matter, and vniuſtly reproue his childe, may the childe make no anſwer?
                  
                     Anſw. Yes, he may, ſo he doe it mildly, reuerendly, and ſeaſonably: not too peremptorily croſſing or thwarting his parent.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Chriſt tooke vp his mother very roundly for reprouing 
                        Luk. 2. 49. him vniuſtly.
                  
                     Anſw. Chriſt as God-man was greater then his mother, and in that reſpect with authoritie blamed her for her vniuſt reproofe. The Virgin Marie was not ignorant thereof, and therefore was ſilent.
               
            
            
               §. 32. Of childrens readineſſe to amend what is iuſtly reproued by their parents.
               
               If a childe be iuſtly for his fault reproued by his parents, See Treat. 3. §. 48.
                  
both conſcience toward God, and obedience to his parent, requireth that he readily redreſſe that which is amiſſe. Vnleſſe amendment of the thing iuſtly reproued be added to patient bearing of reproofe, that patience can be no better accounted of, then diſſimulation, and plaine mockage. When the father 
                     Exo. 18. 17. in law of Moſes told him, that what he did was not well, he forthwith amended it.
               But contrarily many lewd and vngracious children continue to goe on in their wicked courſes, though their parents againe, and againe rebuke them for it. Iuſt was Elies reproofe of his children, but yet no amendment followed. Now note the inference made thereupon by the holy Ghoſt, They obeyed 
                  1 Sam. 2. 25. 
                  not the voice of their father, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them: whereby is implied, that to deſpiſe the iuſt reproofe of parents is an euident ſigne, and forerunner of Gods heauy iudgement. Salomon calls the childe which will heare no rebuke, a Scorner, 
                  
                     Pro. 13. 1. which noteth out a moſt obſtinate ſinner that cannot be reclaimed, and in that reſpect is ſcorned of the Lord. 
                     Pro. 3. 34.
               
            
            
               §. 33. Of Childrens ſubmiſſion to their parents correction.
               
               IIII. Correction is a reall reproofe, a reproofe in the higheſt degree, euen the ſeuereſt kinde of reproofe: ſo as by ſubiection hereunto great tryall of obedience is made. By the ſame meanes muſt a childes ſubmiſſion to his parent in this kinde of reproofe be manifeſted, as in the former: namely,
               1. By bearing patiently the correction which his parent ſhall giue him.
               2. By amending readily that for which he is iuſtly corrected.
               The former of theſe is noted by the Apoſtle as a ruled caſe, a matter not to be denied, in theſe words, 
                     Heb. 12. 9. 
                  We haue had fathers of our fleſh which corrected vs, and we gaue them reuerence. One ſpeciall part of this reuerence is a patient ſuffering: therefore he inferres thereupon, ought we not to be in ſubiection? &c.
               
               The latter is ſet forth by Salomon vnder an effect which followeth vpon the performance thereof: for hauing aduiſed a parent to correct his childe, he addeth this reaſon, 
                     Pro. 29. 17. 
                  He ſhall giue thee reſt, yea he ſhall giue delight vnto thy ſoule: how can

this reſt, and delight be giuen, but by the childes amendment of that for which he is corrected? A parent taketh no delight in the paine, and ſmart of his childe, but in the fruit that followeth thereupon. As a childes tranſgreſſion is 
                     Gen. 26. 35. 
                  a griefe, and vexation to the parent, ſo his amendment cauſeth reſt and delight. Now this effect followeth not ſimply vpon correction, but vpon the good vſe thereof which is made by the childe. It lyeth therefore in the childe, and ſo lyeth vpon him as a dutie, to giue this reſt and delight to his parent by amending the fault for which he is corrected, as he brought griefe to him by prouoking him to vſe correction. Thus ſhall neither parent repent the inflicting, nor the childe repent the induring of correction.
               That a childe may attaine to this degree of obedience, he Direction for well vſing correction. muſt duly conſider both the Cauſe whereby his parent is moued to correct him, and alſo the End which he aimeth at therein. The cauſe is the 
                     Pro. 13. 24. 
                  loue he beareth to his childe. The end which he aimeth at, is his childes 
                  
                     & 22. 15. 
                  good. If theſe motiues worke not obedience, what can?
            
            
               §. 34. Of refuſing, or abuſing correction.
               
               Contrary is diſdaine on the one ſide, and obſtinacie on the other. Diſdaine, when children ſcorne to be corrected by their parents: and in that reſpect when by all the meanes they can vſe, they cannot auoid it, they will mutter and murmure, fret and fume, rage and raue againſt their parents, and deſpiſe and hate them for it. Obſtinacie, when they will be no whit bettered thereby, but ſtill runne on in their leaud courſes, and rather waxe the worſe for being corrected. This may be counted the higheſt pitch of a childes rebellion: for this is the laſt meanes which a parent can vſe to reclaime his childe from deſperate courſes. If this preuaileth not, the law of God requireth, 
                     Deut. 21. 18. &c
                   that a parent ſhould giue vp his childe into the hand of the Magiſtrate, that he may be put to death.
               
                  Hitherto of the diſtinct branches of childrens Obedience.
               
               
                  The Extent thereof followeth.
               
            
            
               
               §. 35. Of childrens conforming their iudgements to their parents.
               
               The extent of childrens obedience is only implied in this Epiſtle to the Epheſians, but it is expreſſed (Col. 3. 20) in theſe words, Children obey your parents 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . IN ALL THINGS. A large extent, but not ſimply to be taken without any limitation: for the Apoſtle himſelfe noteth a reſtraint in theſe words, 
                     Eph. 6. 1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  In the Lord. So farre forth as children tranſgreſſe not any of Gods commandements in obeying their parents, they ought to obey. This is to obey in all things, in the Lord.
               
               
                  Treat. 3. §. 63, 64, &c. The extent of childrens obedience. The extent of childrens duties being the very ſame that was of wiues duties: and the reſtraint alſo the ſame, that order which was there obſerued ſhall here alſo be kept. Only other proofes more pertinent to childrens place, ſhall be brought to confirme thoſe generall propoſitions which may be applied to any inferiours. Many generall reaſons there alledged for proofe of the propoſitions ſhall here be omitted. Wherefore compare this place with that.
               Thus we ſee that parents authority is very large: there is no reſtraint of it but Gods contrary command, whereof a childe muſt be aſſured, if he refuſe to obey his parent in any thing.
               It is not enough for a childe to ſay I haue thus long, and in thus many things obeyed my parent, I hope in ſome things if I haue mine owne will, I may be excuſed. No: All things compriſe more then many things. Wherefore Many are not enough. And though Gods will be exempted, yet is not thine owne will exempted: though thou maieſt doe nothing againſt Gods will, yet thou oughteſt to doe many things againſt thine owne will, if it be contrary to thy parents.
               Two things are to be laboured after by children for attaining to this extent of obedience in all things.
               
               1. They muſt labour to bring their iudgement and will to the bent of their parents: to thinke that meet and conuenient for them to doe which their parents will haue them doe. Though Iſaak thought it ſomewhat ſtrange that he ſhould 
                     Gen. 22. 6, 7. carry wood vp to an hill to offer ſacrifice where was nothing for a burnt offering, yet it being the will of his father that he

ſhould doe ſo, he thought it meet enough for him to doe ſo.
               This ſubiection of iudgement and will is to be yeelded in all the particular caſes of obedience which were §. 13. 14. &c.
                   before propounded, as in their calling, mariage, apparrell, allowance, &c. So as children are to thinke that kinde of calling, that particular match, that apparrell, and that allowance to be meeteſt for them, which their parents thinke meete.
               If the iudgement be perſwaded of the meetneſſe of a thing, 
                     Reaſon.
                   and the will inwardly brought to yeeld vnto it, outward obedience will more readily and cheerefully bee yeelded thereunto.
               Contrary is the ouerweining conceipt which many children Childrens ouer-weining conceit of their owne iudgement aboue their parents, cauſeth much miſchiefe. haue of their owne iudgement and will, who thinke they can better diſcerne what is fit and meete for themſelues, then their parents. They imagine their parents to be too ſtrict and preciſe, or too ſuſpicious and iealous, or too couetous and worldly. This maketh them take what callings, what matches, what apparrell, what allowance they thinke beſt; whence many miſchiefes ariſe, which would all eaſily be auoided, if they would lay downe that preſumptuous conceit, and labour to obſerue the forenamed direction.
            
            
               §. 36. Of childrens yeelding to practiſe at their parents command, ſuch things as in their iudgements they cannot thinke very meet.
               
               2. Though children cannot in their iudgements thinke that which their parents require to be the fitteſt and meeteſt, yet being preſſed thereto by the peremptory command of their parents, in practiſe they ought to yeeld vnto it, ſaying to their parents as Peter to the Lord, Neuertheleſſe at thy word I will doe this, Thus did 
                     Gen. 27. 6. &c.
                   
                  Iaakob yeeld to Rebekah: he thought by doing that which his mother bid him, he ſhould ſeeme a 
                     ••
                  ocker to his father, yet ſhe vrging him, he did it.
               
                  Queſt.
                  May not a childe, yeelding better reaſon then his parent, refuſe to doe what he thinketh vnmeet, or at leaſt for
                     
                        •
                     eare to doe what he is commanded, till he be better informed 
                        •
                     f the meetneſſe thereof?
                  
                     Anſw. With reuerence and humility he may render his

reaſon why he thinketh it not meete, and deſire his parent not to vrge it vpon him.
                  (This did 
                        Gen. 43. 3. 
                     Iudah one of the ſonnes of Iaakob, and is not blamed for it:) and parents ought in ſuch a caſe to yeeld to their children (as 
                        Verſ. 11. 
                     Iaakob did.) But yet if in things indifferent, parents be otherwiſe minded then their children, and will haue their children yeeld to them, they muſt yeeld.
                  For, 1. In in different things the command of a parent is a warrant to the childe, by reaſon of this extent (all things:) ſo as the parent may ſinne in commanding that, in doing whereof the childe may not ſinne. Who can cleare Rebeckah of ſinne in commanding Iaakob to deceiue his father? yet I take it, that Iaakob cannot iuſtly be blamed for obeying.
                  2. Children doe thus manifeſt an high eſteeme of their parents, and very great reſpect towards them: they ſhew how deſirous they are to pleaſe them, and how fearefull to offend them. When the will of parent and childe conſent, there is no ſuch triall.
                  3. By this meanes peace and loue is better preſerued betwixt parent and childe: a parents anger is ſtopped, the effects thereof auoided, and many other miſchiefes preuented, which oft fall out when inferiours refuſe to yeeld to their ſuperiours who haue authority ouer them.
                  Contrary is their prepoſterous peremptorines who will doe A fault for children to be too peremptory -againſt their parents command. nothing againſt their own mind & will, though their parents require it neuer ſo much. This phraſe (
                        Gen. 43. 5. 
                     If thou wilt not ſend, we will not goe downe) which Iudah vſed to his father, though in a good cauſe, was too peremptory for a childe. They who obſtinately refuſe to doe thoſe things which are againſt their owne minde, muſt needs come ſhort of this extent, Obey in all things. Yea they ſhew that what they doe is rather for their owne ſakes becauſe they like it, then for their parents ſake. What obedience then may that be thought to be? Yet this is all the obedience which many children will yeeld. If they thinke not that which their parents require to be meet, nor faire, nor foule meanes ſhall moue them to doe it; whereby many children doe much prouoke their parents. Let ſuch children know, that it is euery way more ſafe for them at the inſtant

command of their parent to doe that which they conceiue to be vnmeet, then peremptorily to diſobey their parents, which is more then vnmeet, euen vnlawfull.
               
            
            
               §. 37. Of the reſtraint of childrens obedience.
               
               The reſtraint of childrens obedience is expreſſed in this clauſe, in the Lord: which phraſe affordeth a neceſſary limitation 
                     Heb. 12. 9. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . in obeying their parents, who are but parents of our fleſh, men and women, ſubiect to erre in their commandements, and to require ſuch ſinfull things as their children may not with a good conſcience performe. The limitation then which the forenamed clauſe (in the Lord) affordeth, is this,
               
                  Children muſt performe no other obedience to their parents, then may ſtand with their obedience to God. The reaſons rendred by the Apoſtle proue as much: This is right, this is well pleaſing to 
                  
                     Epheſ. 6. 1. Col. 3. 20. 
                  the Lord. But to obey parents againſt the Lord is neither right nor wellpleaſing to the Lord.
               If therefore parents command their children to doe any thing See the two paire of cautions annexed to like limitations of a wiues obedience, Treat. 3. §. 51. & 52. and apply them to theſe 1 Sam. 19. 11. &c.
                      limitations of childrens obedience. which the Lord hath forbidden them, they ought not to doe it. On this ground did Michal well in ſuffering her husband Dauid to eſcape out of the handes of Saul her father. I iuſtifie not her manner of carying the matter, with vntruths, and falſe tales; but her refuſing to yeeld to her fathers minde and will is iuſtifiable, and that in two reſpects.
               1. In that the difference was betwixt her husband and father. Now 
                     Gen. 2. 24. & 3. 16. by Gods law a wife is to yeeld to her husband rather then to her father.
               2. Becauſe ſhe knew her father ſought to ſlay him: if then ſhe had deliuered him into the hands of her father, ſhe had made her ſelfe acceſſary to murder. In this latter reſpect Io
                     
                        ••
                     athan alſo did well in refuſing to fetch Dauid at his fathers 1 Sam. 20. 31, 32. command.
               Thus if a father command his childe to goe to Maſſe, to forſweare himſelfe, to marry an Idolater, to ſteale, to lie, or to

commit any other ſinne forbidden by God, the childe ought not to obey: thoſe things cannot be done in the Lord.
               
               Againe if parents forbid their children the doing of any neceſſary duty commanded of God, the childe ought to doe it notwithſtanding the parents inhibition. We may well thinke that Ahaz who ſet himſelfe ſo violently to deface the holy things of God, to prophane his ordinances, and to ſhut vp the doores of Gods Houſe, gaue ſtrait charge to his ſonne that he 2 Chr. 29. 3. &c.
                   ſhould not repaire them againe; yet Hezekiah ſo ſoone as he had power did repaire all.
               If a parent forbid his childe to goe to the Proteſtants Churches, to heare a Sermon, to pray in a knowne tongue, to giue iuſt weight, and meaſure, to ſpeake the truth when he is called to witneſſe it, with the like; he muſt be of Daniels minde, 
                     Dan. 6. 10. and notwithſtanding that prohibition, doe the things which God requireth.
            
            
               §. 38. Of childrens ſinne in yeelding to their parents againſt God.
               
               Contrary to this limitation is on the one ſide a flattering eie-ſeruice in many children, who care not what they doe, be 1. Eie ſeruice. it good or euill, lawfull or vnlawfull, ſo they may pleaſe their parents thereby: and on the other ſide a ſlauiſh fearefulneſſe, 2. Fearefulneſſe. which maketh them ſo to dread their parents as they feare not God at all: they will rather chooſe to ſinne and ſo prouoke Gods wrath, then doe any thing whereby their parents wrath may be prouoked. It is a brand ſet vpon euill kings that they ½ Kin. 22. 52. walked in the waies of their fathers, and mothers: and did wickedly 2 Chr. 22. 4. as they counſelled them. Wherefore the following and obeying of their parents in euill was ſo farre from extenuating their ſinne, as it did rather aggrauate the ſame. The preferring of father and mother before the Lord Chriſt ſheweth that ſuch a childe is 
                     Matt. 10. 37. 
                  not worthy of Chriſt: In compariſon of Chriſt 
                     Luke 14. 26. 
                  Father and mother muſt be hated. But that vndue and vnchriſtian-like reſpect of parents aboue Chriſt, is it that maketh ſo many young Papiſts, young ſwagerers, ſwearers, Motiues to prouoke children to prefer God before their parents. liars, deceitfull perſons, and lewd liuers.
               For auoiding the two forenamed extremes let thine heart be filled with a true feare of God, and withall conſider the difference

betwixt our earthly parents and our heauenly Father. They are but parents 
                     Heb. 12. 9. 
                  of our fleſh, he is the Father of ſpirits. 
                  
                     Luk. 12. 4, 5. They can but touch the body, he can caſt body and ſoule into hell. They are but a while ouer vs, he for euer. Their authority is ſubordinate to his, his ſupreme & abſolute of it ſelfe. They can giue but a light temporary reward; he, an eternall weight of glorie. They cannot ſhelter vs from his wrath, he can from theirs.
               Hitherto of ſuch duties of children as reſpect their parents authority, ſuch as reſpect their neceſſity follow.
            
            
               §. 39. Of childrens Recompence.
               
               The generall head whereunto al the duties which children owe to their parents in regard of their Neceſſity, is in one word Recompence, which is a dutie whereby children indeauour as much as in them lieth, to repay what they can for their parents kindneſſe, care, and coſt towards them, and that in way 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Ariſt. Ethic. l. 8. c. 14. of thankfulneſſe; which maketh a childe thinke he cannot doe too much for his parent, & well may he thinke ſo, for a parent doth much more for his childe before it is able to doe for it ſelfe, then the childe poſſibly can doe for the parent. So as if the parents authority were laid aſide, yet the law of equity requireth this dutie of Recompence: ſo alſo doth the law of piety and charity. Wherefore of all other Duties this is moſt due. 1 Tim. 5. 4. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . It is in expreſſe termes giuen in charge to children by the Apoſtle, who willeth them to learne to requite their parents.
               
               Contrary is neglect of parents in their need, which is more It is monſtrous ingratitude for children to neglect their parents. then monſtrous ingratitude. As all ingratitude is odious to God and man, ſo this moſt of all, and yet very many are guilty thereof. In them the prouerbe is verified that loue is weighty. For it is the property of weighty things to fall downe apace, out to aſcend ſlowly, and that not without ſome violence. Thus loue from the parent to the childe falleth downe apace, 
                     •
                  ut it hardly aſcendeth from children to parents. In which reſpect another prouerbe ſaith, One father will better nouriſh nine children, then nine children one father. Many children in his kinde doe no more for their parents, then for ſtrangers. They either conſider not how much their parents haue done

for them; or elſe they conceit that what their parents did, was of meere dutie, and needeth no recompence. Fie vpon ſuch barbarous and inhumane children!

So as in euery thing wherein a parent needeth his childes helpe, the childe to his power muſt afford his beſt helpe. Beyond ones power nothing can be expected.

                  Outward Infirmities are ſuch as ariſe from ſome inſtant temptation, as were

               Some of theſe latter, which may ſeeme moſt heinous and odious ſinnes, are then to be accounted infirmities, when they who commit them make not a ſport of them, nor delight to liue and lie in them, as ſwine to wallow and lie in the mire: but only at ſome times, through ſome temptation, as it were vnawares, fall into them; and after they are committed they are themſelues more aſhamed of them, and more grieued for them, then any other that ſee them, or heare of them.
               In regard of the naturall infirmities of parents, the dutie of children is both to beare with them, and alſo to couer them ſo farre as they can.
            
            
               §. 41. Of childrens bearing with their parents infirmities.
               
               Children beare with their parents infirmities when they doe not the leſſe reuerendly eſteeme their place, or perſon, nor performe the leſſe dutie to them becauſe of their infirmities.
               This is the firſt particular branch of recompence. For children in their yonger and weaker yeares are ſubiect to many

infirmities: if parents had the leſſe reſpected them for their infirmities, and from thence had taken occaſion to neglect them, and would not haue borne with them, ſurely they could not haue beene ſo well brought vp. That great patience, long-ſufferance, and much forbearance which parents haue ſhewed towards their children, requireth that children in way of recompence ſhew the like to their parents as occaſion is offered. It was a great infirmity in Iſaak to preferre Eſau a prophane childe, before Iaakob a religious childe, eſpecially againſt Gods expreſſe word concerning Iaakob; yet Iaakob reſpected not his father a whit the leſſe for it, as appeares by his 
                     Gen. 27. 12. feare to offend him, and by his 
                     & 28. 5. readineſſe to obey him. 
                     & 37. 10. 
                  Iaakobs vniuſt reproofe of Ioſeph was no ſmall infirmity, and yet how much Ioſeph reuerenced and euery way reſpected his father the hiſtory following ſheweth. Sauls infirmities were farre more and much greater then any of theirs, yet what dutie and faithfulneſſe did Ionathan his ſonne performe to him, euen to their deaths? for 1 Sam. 31. 2. he died with him.
               We haue herein the patterne of Chriſt himſelfe: how great infirmity did his mother bewray, when ouer-raſhly ſhe rebuked him being about a good worke, a bounden duty, his Fathers buſineſſe? yet immediatly thereupon it is noted that he went downe with his parents, and was ſubiect to them: which 
                     Luk. 2. 51. manifeſteth the honour he gaue to his mother, notwithſtanding her infirmitie.
               Contrary to this duty doe they, who take occaſion from their parents infirmities to thinke baſely of their perſon and A childe may not diſpiſe a parent for any infirmity. their place, and thereupon grow careleſſe in duty, either refuſing to doe any duty at all, or elſe doing it careleſly, grudgingly, diſdainefully, and ſcornefully. Abſolom made a ſuppoſed infirmity of his father the ground of his rebellion. Had 2 Sam. 15. 3. his pretence beene true, yet had it not beene a ſufficient cauſe for him to diſgrace, and riſe againſt his father, as he did. The law that threatneth Gods vengeance againſt ſuch children as mocke at their father, or deſpiſe to obey their mother, maketh 
                     Pro. 30. 17. no exception of parents infirmities.
            
            
               §. 42. Of childrens couering their parents infirmities.
               
               Children couer their parents infirmities both by paſſing by

them (as we ſpeake) and taking no notice of them, and alſo by concealing them from others as much as they can. The Scripture noteth it to be a property of loue to couer a multitude 
                  1 Pet. 4. 8. 
                  of ſinnes: now in whom ſhould loue abound, if not in children? And who ſhould more manifeſt this property of loue then children?
               Of paſſing by and concealing from others a parents infirmity, we haue a worthy patterne in Shem and Iaphet: when Noah their father being drunken lay vncouered in the midſt of his tent, they went backward (that they might not themſelues 
                     Gen. 9. 23. ſee their fathers infirmity) and couered his nakedneſſe (that others might not ſee it.) The bleſſing which vpon this occaſion was then promiſed to them and their poſterity, ſheweth how acceptable this dutie was to God.
               Contrary was Chams practiſe, who diſcouered, and made A Sinne for a childe to diſcouer a parents infirmity. knowne his fathers nakedneſſe. The curſe thereupon denounced againſt him, ſheweth how odious that ſinne was vnto God. Too many there be of Chams curſed brood, who blaze abroad their parents infirmities, and make ſuch things knowne of them, 
                     Gen. 9. 22. Verſ. 25. as otherwiſe would not be knowne: whereby they bring much diſhonour and ſhame vpon their parents (which can be no honour 
                     Parent is imprecatione nihil pernicioſius excogitari poteſt. Plato de Leg. lib. 11. to the children,) and withall a curſe from their parents on themſelues, which the heathen accounted very dreadfull.
               More contrary was Abſoloms practiſe, who raiſed a moſt malicious ſlander of his father, and thereby alienated his ſubiects hearts from him. Too many Abſolom-like ſeeke to raiſe a ſuppoſed More then monſtrous for a childe to raiſe a ſlander of a parent. reputation and honour to themſelues by vilifying and diſgracing their parents: but let them note Abſoloms end. Aſſuredly, if they hold on in that courſe, the like, or a worſe, ſhall be their end.
            
            
               §. 43. Of childrens bearing with their parents caſuall neceſſities. 
                  2 Sam. 15. 3.
               
               Caſuall extremities, are all manner of croſſes which by the prouidence of God are laid vpon a man: whether vpon his bodie, as blindneſſe, lameneſſe, ſickneſſe, &c. or on his perſon, as captiuitie, baniſhment, impriſonment, &c. or on his eſtate, as pouerrie, penurie, &c. In all theſe, children muſt beare with their parents, as in the forenamed infirmities; neither leſſe reuerendly eſteeme of

them, nor performe the leſſe dutie becauſe of them. Theſe are ſuch neceſſities, as are not ſinfull in themſelues; and therefore in regard of theſe, parents are much more to be borne withall. Though Iſaak were blinde, yet did not Iaakob a whit the leſſe reſpect 
                     Gen 27. 1. Ruth 1, 16, 21. him. Though Naomi were poore, yet Ruth her daughter in law continued to doe a childs dutie and ſeruice vnto her.
               Contrary is the vnnaturall diſpoſition of ſuch children, as Vnnaturall to deſpiſe a parent for any caſuall infirmitie. take occaſion from theſe caſuall neceſſities of their parents to deſpiſe them. God hath made an expreſſe law againſt deſpiſing thoſe who are by any outward defects impotent, as deafe, blinde, &c. If no perſon may deſpiſe another, for theſe, much leſſe children

               §. 44. Of childrens releeuing their parents according to their neede.
               
               Beſides bearing with parents neceſſities, in ſuch caſes as parents ſtand in need of their childrens releefe and ſuccour, they muſt afford it them. In ſickneſſe they muſt viſit them, as 
                     Gen. 48. 1. 
                  Ioſeph viſited his father. In time of mourning, they muſt comfort them, as 
                     & 37. 35. the children of Iaakob. In want, they muſt prouide things needfull for them, as 
                     & 42. 8. the ſonnes of Iaakob, who went vp to buy food for their father; and as 
                     & 47. 12. 
                  Ioſeph, who ſent for Iaakob into Egypt, and there nouriſhed him. It is noted of 
                     Ruth 2. 18. 
                  Ruth, that ſhee did not only gleane for her mother a poore woman, but alſo reſerued ſome of that food which was giuen to her ſelfe to eat, for her. In time of danger they muſt doe what they can for their protection and preſeruation, as 1 Sam. 22. 3, 4. 
                  Dauid had in this reſpect an eſpeciall care of his father and mother. Yea, if God be pleaſed to Vetuſtiſſima lex erat inſcripta mentibus omnium, vt liberi ſi hoc officij grauentur impendere quod pulli ciconiarum reponunt ſuis parentibus, velut impij conijciantur in vincula. Eraſm. Inſtit. Matrim. take children out of this world before their parents, and their parents be ſuccourleſſe, they muſt take what order they can for the well-being of their parents after their owne departure, as 
                     Iohn 19. 27. Chriſt, who commended his mother to his diſciple Iohn a little before his death. Theſe and ſuch like duties are particular branches of recompence, and are all compriſed vnder that 1 Tim. 5. 4.

                  requitall, which the Apoſtle requireth of children: And they are but a ſmall part of requitall of all the paines, care, and charges, that parents haue been at with their children. Yea, this only thing, that parents haue brought forth children into the world, can children neuer ſufficiently

requite. Nature hath taught thus much, not only vnto heathen men, but alſo vnto the vnreaſonable creatures. Among other vnreaſonable creatures, the example of the Ariſt. Plin. Suidas. 
                  Storke is worthy to be noted: for it is recorded of that kinde, that when the dammes are old, the young ones feed them; and when through age, they are ready to faint in their flying, the young ones will helpe; and when they are paſt flying, the young ones carrie them on their backs. The 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Sin of Phariſies in freeing children from relieuing their parents. Greeke name of a Storke is taken from that word, which ſignifieth, to requite a parents kindneſſe: or elſe this word is taken from that name: they are both of the ſame notation.
               Contrary is the opinion of Phariſies, who thought that children by conſecrating their ſubſtance to the Temple, might be freed from this dutie of recompence to parents, which is the myſterie of that Hebrew word 
                     Mar. 7. 11. 
                  Corban. They made a meere pretext of piety to God, a cauſe of manifeſt impietie againſt parents. Chriſt giueth this verdict of them, that 
                     verſ. 13. 
                  they make the word of God of none effect. 
                  See §. 14. 1. Sin of children in denying releefe to parents. Papiſts are of the ſame opinion, and ſo vnder the ſame cenſure.
               Contrary alſo is their practiſe, who hauing the goods of this world, ſuffer their parents to want. 1 Ioh. 3. 17. Iniquiſſimum eſt patrē egere, cùm filius ſit in facultatibus. Digeſt. lib. 25. tit. 3. §. 5. 
                  S. Iohn ſaith, that the loue of God dwelleth not in him, who ſhutteth vp his compaſſion from his brother in that caſe; how then can it dwell in ſuch a childe? Not they only who ſuffer their parents to ſtarue, offend in this extreme, but they alſo who ſuffer them to liue poorely, and baſely, when themſelues 
                     Luk. 16. 19. 2. In bringing parents into extremities. Diues-like fare delicately, and goe gorgeouſly attired euery day.
               In an higher degree doe they offend, who bring their parents to ſuch extremities, as to pouertie by their lauiſh ſpending; to priſon by importuning them to be their ſureties; to exceſſiue griefe by their miſchieuous practiſes, as 
                     Gen. 37. 34. 3. In ſtriking parents. the ſonnes of Iaakob.
               
               But what ſhall we ſay of ſuch graceleſſe children, as dare ſtrike their parents? 
                     Exod. 21. 15. 4. In murthering parents. Gods law accounteth ſuch a childe vnworthy of life, and adiudgeth him to death.
               Nay, what may be ſaid of father-quellers, and mother-quellers? There was of old no particular law made againſt them, becauſe it is, ſuppoſed, that no childe can be ſo vnnaturall and inhumane. In imitation whereof Solon cùm interrogaretur, cur nullum ſupplicium conſtituiſſet. in eum qui parentem necaſſet, reſpondit, ſe id neminem facturum putaſſe. Cic. pro Roſ. Amer. 
                  Solon, that wiſe law-maker among the heathen, made no law againſt them: and his reaſon being aſked,

he anſwered, that he thought no childe would commit ſuch a fact.
               When afterwards ſuch inhumane impietie was manifeſted in the world, the Ciuill Law ordained this puniſhment; 
                     Si quis parentus fata propera uerit, neque gladio, neque ignibus, neque vlli alij ſolenni poenae ſubiugetur, ſed inſutus culeo cum cane, & gallo gallinaceo, & vipera, & ſimia, vel in vicinū mare, vel in amnem proijciatur, &c. Juſtin. Cod. l. 9. tit. 17. Cur voluerint parricidas inſui in culeum viuos, atque ita in flumen deijci, docet Cicero pro Roſ. Amer. Ad famam filij attinet, vt videatur honorem debitum patri defuncto praeſtitiſſe. Cic. Philip. 9. 
                  If any ſhall kill his parent, let him not be put to the ſword, nor fire, nor any other vſuall puniſhment: but let him be ſowed in a ſacke with a dog, and a cocke, and a viper, and an ape, and caſt into the next ſea, or riuer; that while life is in him, he may begin to want all vſe of the elements, and be depriued, while he liueth, of the aire, and when he is dead, of the earth.
               
               This ſinne hauing beene committed among the heathen, the Apoſtle reckoneth it vp among other moſt notorious and barbarous ſinnes, 1. Tim. 1. 9. As murther is one of thoſe ſinnes, which the earth can leaſt beare, and which cryeth loudeſt to heauen for vengeance; ſo among the ſeuerall kinds of murther, this is the moſt vnſupportable, and crying.
               Thus much of the duties of children, which they are to performe while their parents liue. It remaineth to ſpeake of thoſe which they are to performe when their parents are dead.

                        The duties which children owe to their parents after they are dead, concerne the

               It is the dutie of children to bring the bodies of their parents deceaſed, with ſuch decencie and honour, as may be anſwerable to the place and reputation wherein they liued.
               So as both the thing it ſelfe, and the manner of doing it, is to be obſerued. Buriall a meanes to maintaine hope of reſurrection.
               
               The thing it ſelfe, namely Buriall of the corps of ſuch as are deceaſed, hath euer beene in vſe in Gods Church: and it hath beene vſed as a meanes to maintaine our hope of the reſurrection of our bodies. Many of the heathen, who neuer dreamt of the reſurrection,

Aeneid. 11. were wont to burne the dead bodies of their friends: other heathen learned this manner of buriall from the Church, though they knew not the myſterie thereof. It is more cleare then needs be proued, that Gods people, from the beginning of the world, haue performed this dutie of buriall to their friends; but

it is not pertinent to the point in hand, to inſiſt vpon the generall: that it belongs eſpecially to children to procure this dutie to be performed, is now the point to be proued, which is readily done by the approued examples of 
                     Gen. 25. 9. 
                  Iſaak, 
                  & 35. 29.

                  & 50. 7. 
                  Ioſeph, and others expreſly recorded in Scripture.
               And great reaſon there is for it: for
               1. It is a teſtimonie of great loue and good reſpect to the partie 1. Reaſon.
                   deceaſed. Now who ſhould manifeſt more loue, and greater reſpect then a childe?

                  Dauid bleſſeth the men of Iabeſh Gilead for burying Saul, and acknowledgeth it a kindneſſe done to Saul. Now who ought rather to procure a bleſſing, and doe a kindneſſe to parents, then children, who are oft bleſſed through their parents meanes?
               3. It being a great deformity to haue a mans corps lie aboue 3. Reaſon.
                   ground (for no carkaſe will be more loathſome then a mans if it lie vnburied) children, who are moſt bound to couer their parents deformity, are in this reſpect bound to burie their corps. Sinne of children to neglect their parents dead corps.
               
               Contrary is their practiſe whoſe mindes are ſo ſet on their parents goods, as they cleane neglect their bodies. So ſoone as their parents breath is out of their body, they ſo buſie themſelues about the things which they haue left behinde them, as their corps is ready to ſtinke before care be taken for the buriall of it. Yea, ſome will purpoſely keepe their parents corps aboue ground till they be exceeding noiſome, for receiuing ſome reuenues, or debts, or other accounts, which muſt be paid before the corps be buried. If their corps muſt needes for ſometime be kept aboue ground, let them be imbalmed, or ſo vſed as they may not ſauour. They who are careleſſe hereof, ſhew that they reſpect their parents wealth Sinne of children entring vpon their parents eſtate before they are dead. 1 King. 1. 5. more then his perſon and honour.
               In which reſpect they alſo heinouſly tranſgreſſe, who are ſo greedy of their parents eſtate, as they muſt needs preuent his departure, and like Adoniah enter vpon their fathers eſtate, and take poſſeſſion of his goods before breath is out of his

body: whereby they doe oft cauſe great diſquietneſſe to him that would depart in peace.
               Againe, others bearing an inward grudge and ſecret hatred Sinne of children diſturbing their parents funerall. againſt a brother, or other kinſman, whom their parent intirely loued, and in that reſpect durſt not meddle with him in their parents life-time, ſo ſoone, as their parent is dead, picke a quarrell with the party hated, and ſo diſturbe and hinder their parents funerall. Such a plot Eſau intended: but God defeated 
                     Gen. 27. 41. it, whereby it appeareth that God is diſpleaſed therewith.
            
            
               §. 46. Of the decency wherewith children ought to ſee their parents buried.
               
               The manner after which children ought to ſee their parents buried, muſt be with ſuch decency as is agreeable to the commendable cuſtome of the countrie and Church where their parents die, and with ſuch honour as is in ſome meaſure anſwerable to the eſtate, and place of their parents while they liued (at leaſt if it be not aboue the meanes that the parent hath left, or aboue the abilitie of the childe that maketh the ſolemnitie.) Ioſeph was a great Gouernour in Egypt, by reaſon whereof his father when he came thither was highly accounted of: accordingly 
                     Gen. 50. 7. with great honour did he carry him to his graue.
               There are two extremes contrary to the forenamed decency 
                  Contrary, 1. Too ſumptuous funerals.

Hence it commeth to paſſe that they chuſe out ſtrange places where neither their parents or ſelues are knowne, and the dead of the night that none may eſpie them; and appoint an vncertaine time, that no friend may accompany them. God oft meeteth with ſuch proud, couetous children in their kinde, and cauſeth them with like diſhonour to be brought to their graues.
            
            
               §. 47. Of childrens paying their parents debts after their death.
               
               As children muſt haue reſpect to the body of their parents Childrens reſpect to the credit of their deceaſed parents. deceaſed, ſo alſo to their credit and name, which is a thing of greater account, and honour: a thing wherein they may bring a kinde of bleſſing to their parents and make them liue after their death.
               Parents themſelues cannot doe any thing when they are dead to preſerue the ſame: children therefore being the liuing Image of their parents muſt indeuour to doe it.
               Three things there be which children muſt make conſcience of, euen in regard of their deceaſed parents credit, and reputation; one, to pay their debts: another, to ſuppreſſe ill rumors: a third, to imitate their good example.
               I. If the eſtate of parents, their goods or lands come to their children, their dutie is to pay their debts, ſo farre as they can: eſpecially if by law thoſe debts may be recouered at their hands. For what law may force others to doe in equitie and Iuſtice, conſcience muſt moue good children to doe in charitie, and recompence to their parents. The holy Ghoſt makes it a 
                     Pſal. 37. 21. note of a wicked man to borrow and not to pay. Wherfore to wipe away that blot from the name of a parent deceaſed, children muſt be ready in this kinde to doe what the parent himſelfe, if he were liuing, would, or ſhould doe. Yea if children of themſelues be well able, though their parents left not ſufficient to pay all their debts, they ought to pay them. Herein eſpecially a childlike affection is manifeſted to the parent.
               Contrary is their practiſe who ſtriue to get all they can of their parents, and yet make no conſcience of paying any debts at all, vnleſſe law force them thereto. What they doe in this caſe cannot be thought to be done for their parents ſake, but rather

for their owne ſake. Many ſo little reſpect their parents credit in this kinde, as they priuily conueigh away and vtterly conceale much of their parents eſtate, of purpoſe to defeate Creditors: which as it is a part of apparent iniuſtice, ſo it is a cauſe of opening the mouthes of men againſt their parents, to their diſcredit and ſhame.

               * The direction giuen before concerning childrens ſpeech §. 7. of their parents behinde their backs, may fitly be applied alſo to the care which children ought to haue of the ſpeeches and reports which are made of their parents after their departure. It followeth as from the leſſe to the greater, that what children doe for their parents credit in abſence behinde their backes, they muſt much more doe when they are dead: for then there is no hope, no poſſibilitie that parents ſhould doe any thing to right their owne wrong in that kinde: it lyeth therefore vpon children to doe it.
               Doe not they cleane contrary, who take occaſion from the departure of their parents, both to open their eares to receiue any ill reports of them, and alſo to open their mouthes to ſpeake ill of them: then blazing abroad all their infirmities, and ſtretching their ill reports of their parents beyond the liſts of truth. Ill birds they are that ſo bewray their owne neaſt. They know that their parents being dead can haue no notice thereof: whereby they ſhew what little piety to God or parent is in their heart. But there is an euer-liuing, all-ſeeing, and all-knowing Father that taketh notice of all: who beſide other

               §. 49. Of childrens imitating their parents good example.
               
               If parents haue beene perſons of good carriage in their life

time, as religious towards God, iuſt in their dealings with men, mercifull to ſuch as ſtood in need of their helpe, doing much good in their place, and ſo ended their daies with much credit; it is an eſpeciall meanes to maintaine and continue this their credit, for children to walke in their ſteps, and to indeuour to be like them.
               Thus is a bleſſed memorie of their parents kept freſh and greene (as we ſpeake) though their bodies be rotten. For when they who knew the parents behold the like good qualities and actions in their children, they will thereby be put in minde of the parties deceaſed, and ſay, Oh how ſuch parents yet liue! behold a liuely, and liuing Image of them. Thus did Salomon, Aſa, Iehoſaphat, Hezekiah, Ioſiah and ſuch like good Kings which came of the ſtocke and linage of Dauid, keepe the memory of their father Dauid, freſh, faire, and flouriſhing (long after his body was rotten) as is euident by theſe and ſuch like phraſes, He walked in the ordinances of Dauid his

               Contrary are both thoſe that are vnlike good parents, and thoſe that are like euill parents. The former ſort doe much impeach and diſhonour the reputation of their parents, as Rehoboam, who by his fooliſh rigorous and vniuſt carriage, made the people ſpeake contemptuouſly of Dauid.

               The latter ſort continue in memorie the euill name, and the ſhame of their parents, and cauſe them to ſtinke more and more: as the ſonnes and ſucceſſors of Ieroboam, who following his idolatrous courſe, made it the more remembred, and cauſed this blur to remaine in his ſtile from age to age, Ieroboam which made Iſrael to ſinne.

to haue execution done on him in Dauids time: and Shemeis 
                  & 19. 23. offence was committed in the time of Dauids humiliation, which made him ſweare that he would not himſelfe take Vengeance of him. Beſides, Salomon executed iuſtice on the one and the other, not for the wrongs they did to his father, but for other crimes which they committed in his time: onely their former offences were remembred to aggrauate the matter.
               Thus farrc of childrens duties. The manner of performing them followeth to be declared.
            
            
               §. 52. Of the manner of performing childrens duties.
               
               That clauſe which § 37. noted out the limitation of childrens duties, affoordeth alſo an excellent direction for the manner of performing them. It is this, in the Lord: that is, Children muſt ſo performe their duty to their parents as they would or ſhould performe it to the Lord.
               
               More particularly it implieth theſe ſix points: How children obey their parents in the Lord.
                  
               
               1. That their duties be performed in conſcience, or for conſcience ſake, which is all one as for the Lords ſake: for the Lord onely is Iudge of the conſcience and hath power ouer it. Thus 1. By obeying for the Lords ſake. Rom. 13. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. Col. 3. 20. muſt ſubiects performe duty to magiſtrates: much more children to parents. The reaſon which the Apoſtle rendereth in theſe words, This is wel-pleaſing to the Lord, ſheweth that children in obeying their parents muſt labour to approue themſelues to God.
               2. Their duties muſt be in ſincerity, which is when children 2 In ſincerity. pretend in ſhew to doe no more, then in truth and heart they meane: Whatſoeuer ye doe, doe it heartily as to the Lord, ſaith 
                     Col. 3. 23. the Apoſtle. Parents vſe to deale with none more heartily then with their children: accordingly muſt children deale with parents.
               3. They muſt be performed cheerefully, with a willing and 3. With cheerefulneſſe. ready minde: for the Lord loueth cheerefulneſſe. Herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt a filiall and ſeruile, a childe 2 Cor. 9. 7. like and ſlauelike obedience. 4 With reuetence.
               
               4. They muſt be performed reuerendly as to them which beare the Image of God. Hereof we ſpake §. 3. before.
               5. They muſt ſo be performed, as in performing them no 5. In the feare of God.

Lord himſelfe is conſtant in all his waies and workes, ſo he expecteth that children ſhould be in the duties which he requireth at their hands. He that beginneth well, and holdeth not on, loſeth all the glory of his good beginning.
               If the examples of all good children commended in Scripture be well weighed, we ſhall finde their duties, ſo farre forth as they were acceptable to God, performed after the foreſaid manner, in all the branches thereof.

It appeares that ſuch children looke only on their parents as men, which, as they imagine, can neuer recompence their paines and coſt: they looke not to God who is able abundantly to recompence all. Theſe therefore performe not their duty in the Lord.
               
            
            
               §. 54. Of the equall reſpect that children are to beare to both parents.
               
               As the diſtinct duties of children haue beene ſet forth, ſo I thinke it requiſite to declare diſtinctly who the parties be to whom thoſe duties are to be performed. Theſe principally are the naturall parents, both Father and Mother. Secondarily ſuch as are in the place of parents.
               The firſt point then to be noted is, that children beare an equall reſpect to both their naturall parents, and performe duty to both alike. The law expreſly mentioneth both, Honour thy Father and thy Mother. Well may we thinke that there was ſome iuſt and vrgent cauſe, that the law which ſo briefly vnder as few words as well could be, compriſeth exceeding much matter, ſhould expreſly mention father and mother, when as there is one word, parent, which includeth both. Now what other reaſon can be rendred then the point in hand?
               It is worthy to be noted, how the Apoſtle contenteth not himſelfe to haue named parents, which implieth both, but alſo annexeth the expreſſe words of the law, which in particular ſetteth downe, father and mother. It is expreſly ſet downe of Iaakob that he obeyed his father and his mother. Among other 
                     Gen. 28. 7. pen-men of Scripture Salomon expreſly mentioneth both father and mother, euen almoſt twenty ſeuerall times in Prou.
               Many reaſons there be to inforce this point.
               1. Both parents are vnder God a like meanes of their childrens Reaſons. being. Children come out of the ſubſtance of both alike.
               2. The care and pains of both for the good of the children is very great: I know not of whether the greater. The mothers paines and care in bringing forth the childe is indeed the greater, and it may be alſo the greater in bringing vp the childe, eſpecially while it is young, at leaſt if ſhe giue it ſucke her ſelfe: yet afterwards the fathers exceedeth in prouiding fit calling,

ſufficient meanes of maintenance, yea and portion or inheritance for it, and that after he himſelfe is dead. Thus one way or other the childe is equally bound to both: and accordingly Gods law maketh no difference betwixt them.
               
                  
                     Obiect. The wife is ſubiect to her husband: therefore a childe ought to preferre his father before his mother.
                  
                     Anſw. Though there be a difference betwixt father and Both parents to be of like account with children. mother in relation of one to another, yet in relation to their children they are both as one, and haue a like authority ouer them. Now children are not to looke to that difference that is betwixt their parents in that mutuall relation that is betwixt husband and wife, but to that authority which both parents haue ouer their children: and ſo to carry an equall reſpect to both.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. What if the fathers and mothers diſpoſition Direction for a childe when one parent commandeth one thing, the other another. be contrary: and the one command what the other forbids.
                  
                     Anſw. The thing commanded or forbidden muſt be obſerued: if it be about a thing ſimply good or euill, lawfull, or vnlawfull, then the parent which would haue the thing lawfull to be done, or vnlawfull to be for borne (though it be the mother) muſt be obeyed: for in this caſe ſhe is backt with Gods authority. But if the matter be meerely indifferent, then I doubt not but the father muſt be obeyed: yet ſo as the childe no way ſhew any contempt to his mother, but with all reuerence and humility make it knowne to her that it is beſt both for her-ſelfe and himſelfe, that his father be obeyed. But if the fathers contrary authority be not interpoſed, or if the father be dead, then is a mother as ſimply and abſolutely to be obeyed in all things, as a father.
               
            
            
               §. 55. Of pretences alledged to obey father rather then mother.
               
               Contrary on the one ſide is their childiſh fondneſſe who ſo wholly reſpect their mother, and ſeeke to pleaſe her, as they little regard their father, vnleſſe through feare they be forced thereto: and on the other ſide, their ſcornefull ſpirit who only beare reſpect to their father, and altogether neglect their mother, if not deſpiſe her. For the moſt part, of the two, the mother is leſſe regarded. The reaſons whereof I take to be theſe

following, whereunto I will annex particular meanes to remoue the ſeeming force of thoſe reaſons, as antidotes or remedies vnto them.
               
                  1. The mother by reaſon of her ſex is commonly the weaker, and ſubiect to more infirmities.
                  
                     Anſw. Children ought rather to looke vpon their mothers place and authority, then their perſon and infirmitie: ſo theſe would no whit impaire their reſpect of the other.
                  
               
               
                  2. The mother is more indulgent and tender to her children: and vſeth more familiarity towards them: now familiarity 
                     Familiaritas parit contemptum. Teren. in Andr. 
                     breedeth contempt.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. This is the abuſe of familiarity: loue ſhould breed loue: and loue muſt be ordered according to the condition of the parties louing, and loued. As children with one eie behold the affection of the mother, ſo with another they ſhould behold Gods image in the mother; and then (that which is §. 2, 3. noted as the ground of all childrens dutie) a louing-feare would be wrought in their heart, which would caſt out all contempt.
               
               
                  3. The mother hath not that power to reward or reuenge that a father hath.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. This is not to obey in the Lord. No outward reſpect ſhould moue the childe to obey his parents ſo much as conſcience to God-wards. If children duly conſidered God, how he hath made no difference, but commanded them to obey both alike, and how he is able abundantly to reward, and ſeuerely to reuenge, that reaſon would be no reaſon.
               
               
                  4. The mother is ſubiect to the father.
                  
                     Anſw. This was remoued §. 54. before.
                  As a generall anſwer to theſe and all other ſuch pretences as can be alledged, let it be noted that the Lord doth not only in expreſſe termes charge children to feare their mother, but alſo (the more to preſſe this point) ſometime ſetteth the mother in the firſt place, thus; Yee ſhall feare euery man his mother, 
                     
                        Leu. 19. 3. 
                     and his father: which is not ſo to be taken as if the mother of the two were the more excellent (in this reſpect the father for the moſt part is firſt named) but becauſe it is the trueſt triall of a childes ſubiection to be ſubiect to his mother. He that

willingly and conſcionably ſubiecteth himſelfe to her, who is in relation to her husband the inferiour, in ſex the weaker, in condition ſubiect to more infirmities, in her affections leſſe moderate, in power leſſe able to reward, or to puniſh, will much rather (no doubt) ſubiect himſelfe to his father.
               
            
            
               §. 56. Of the difference of childrens ſubiection to naturall parents, and to ſuch as only are in the place of parents.
               
               Beſide naturall parents, there are others by God ſo ſet ouer children, as they owe in conſcience child-like dutie vnto them. Theſe in generall are ſuch as are in the place of parents, and ſo performe, or at leaſt ought to performe, the dutie of parents to children.
               They are of two ſorts.
               1. Such as are ioyned to a naturall parent in mariage, commonly called Step-fathers, and ſtep-mothers, or fathers in law, and mothers in law.
               
               2. Such as haue the gouernment and tuition of children committed to them, commonly called Guardians, Tutors, Gouernours: yea alſo foſter-fathers, and foſter-mothers.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. Is the ſame dutie in euery reſpect due to thoſe who are in place of parents, as to naturall parents themſelues?
                  
                     Anſw. Not ſo. There is ſuch a prerogatiue appertaining to naturall parents from whom children haue receiued their being, that many things wherein children by an abſolute neceſſity De neceſſitate. are bound to them, are bound vnto the other who are but in place of parents, only by the law of honeſty, of meetneſſe & De honeſtate. conueniency. Whence it commeth to paſſe that ſuch things as being done by children rebelliouſly without, or againſt the conſent of naturall parents proue meere nullities, will ſtand in force though they be done without or againſt the conſent of ſuch as are only in the place of parents: inſtance contracts made about goods, lands and ſuch other things as parents retaine a right in: whereunto many good Diuines adde See §. 16. contracts of mariage, of calling and the like.
                  Yet notwithſtanding ſeeing in conſcience we are bound to thoſe things which the law of honeſty, and conueniency requirety (for whatſoeuer things are honeſt, iuſt, and of good report, 
                     
                        Phil. 4. 8.
                     
are to be done) great is that dutie which children owe to thoſe who are in place of parents.
               
            
            
               §. 57. Of childrens ſubiection to fathers and mothers in law.
               
               Fathers and mothers in law are to be ranked in the firſt degree of thoſe who are in the place of naturall parents. Very good proofe there is in Scripture for childrens ſubiection to them. The reſpect which Moſes beare to his father in law, 
                     Exo. 18. 7. Ruth. 1. & 2. Luk. 2. 51. and Ruth to her mother in law, and Chriſt himſelfe to his ſuppoſed father, are commended for this very purpoſe. Subiection is noted in Chriſts example: Reuerence in Moſes: Recompence in Ruths.

                   the naturall parent that marieth another, maketh that other one with him, and in that reſpect is as a parent to the children, and by them ought to be accounted ſo.
               The law of God maketh it plaine in

                     ſt for a ſonne to vncouer

                  the ſhame of his mother in law, or for a father in law to vncouer the ſhame of his daughter in law. Whereby it appeareth that fathers and mothers in law, are by Gods law in the very place and ſteed of naturall parents to their children, and accordingly as naturall parents are to be honoured.
               Beſides it is a great honour which a childe doth to his naturall 2. Reaſon.
                   father or mother to reſpect ſuch as they haue made one fleſh with themſelues, as they doe their owne parent. So as to honour a father, or mother in law, is to honour a naturall parent.
               Contrary is the minde and cariage of moſt children. Very few beare a reuerend, dutifull, and child-like reſpect to ſtepfathers, and ſtep-mothers: but for the moſt part deſpiſe them in heart, grumble at them in ſpeech, and are very vndutifull in their behauiour: whence it commeth to paſſe that they bring much griefe to their naturall parent, and oft cauſe much diſcord and diſſention betwixt their naturall, and step-parent
                     •
                   being herein ſet on worke by Satan, who laboureth what he can to diſunite thoſe whom God hath neerely vnited together and made one fleſh. Lamentable experience ſheweth that the ſecond, third, or any after-mariages are ſeldome ſo comfortable and peaceable as the firſt: eſpecially if either the one, or other,
                  
or both haue children. The cauſe thereof, for the moſt part, is in children, who brooke not fathers or mothers in law.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Nature cannot ſo well brooke a ſtep-parent, as a naturall parent.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. If not ſo well, yet deſpiſe them not: there is a difference betwixt extremes.
                  2. Conſcience and religion ought to alter corrupt nature. Looke to Gods ordinance: and let Gods feare poſſeſſe thine heart, that that may bring thee to doe what nature cannot.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. Fathers and Mothers in law ſeldome reſpect their husbands or wiues former children.
                  
                     Anſw. This obiection more beſeemeth the mouth of a barbarian then a Chriſtian. The Goſpell teacheth to be ſubiect not 
                     1 Pet. 2. 18. Rom. 12. 21. 
                     only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward: and not to be ouercome of euill, but to ouercome euill with goodneſſe.
                  
                  The Scripture reckoneth ſuch as riſe vp againſt their parents 
                        Mic. 7. 6. in law, among ſuch as riſe vp againſt their naturall parents: ſhewing thereby that the impietie of thoſe, is as blame-worthy, as the impietie of theſe.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 58. Of childrens ſubiection to Guardians, Tutors, &c.
               
               For childrens ſubiection to Gouernours, Guardians, and Tutors, the Apoſtle ſaith that a childe is vnder them. If by the law 
                     Galat. 4. 2. children are vnder them, they ought in equitie to be ſubiect to them. It is expreſly noted of Esther, euen after the King had choſen her for his wife, that ſhe did the commandement of Mordecai 
                  
                     Eſth. 2. 20. (who was as a Guardian to her) like as when ſhe was brought vp with him. A memorable patterne for this purpoſe. What pretences might ſhe haue made to haue caſt off all manner of ſubiection? Mordecai was but her coſen: ſhe was now aduanced aboue him: a wife ſhe was, and ſo ſubiect to her husband: yea a Kings wife, and ſo her ſelfe a Queene: yet ſhe was ſubiect, and her ſubiection commended. We reade that the children of the Prophets much 2 Kin. 2. 15, &c. & 6. 1. reſpected Eliſha, did reuerence to him, and were obedient to him, becauſe he was as a father and tutor vnto them: in which reſpect alſo Eliſha was as a childe ſubiect to Eliah, whom he called 2 King. 2. 12. 
                  father.
               
               Guardians, Tutors, and ſuch like ouer-ſeers of children, haue a parents charge laid vpon them, as we ſhall Treat 6. §. 74, &c. after ſhew: great reaſon

therefore that child-like dutie ſhould be yeelded to them. Their honour muſt be anſwerable to their charge and care.
               Contrary is the conceit of many lawleſſe children, whoſe parents being dead, or they being ſent and placed abroad out of the gouernment of their parents, thinke they are cleane free from all gouernment, and may liue as they liſt. Their practiſe being correſpondent to this opinion, they runne into all riot, and in time bring themſelues to vtter ruine. It is the ouerthrow of many children, that they regard not their Guardians, Tutors, and Gouernours: and God in iudgement bringeth many ſuch refractarie children to ſome fearefull & ſhamefull end or other. Let children therefore be wiſe, and not take too much libertie to themſelues.
               Thus farre haue beene handled the duties of children in their ſeuerall kindes, the manner of performing them, and the parties to whom they are to be performed. It remaineth to ſpeake of the reaſons which the Apoſtle alledgeth to inforce thoſe duties.
            
            
               §. 59. Of the place of parents, whereby children ought to be moued to obey them.
               
               The reaſons which the Apoſtle vſeth to moue children to performe their dutie are foure:

                     The firſt is taken from the place of the parent.
                     The ſecond from the equitie of the thing.
                     The third from Gods expreſſe charge.
                     
                     The fourth from Gods promiſe.
                     
                  
               
               I. The place of a parent is noted forth by this phraſe, IN THE LORD: which as it affordeth a 
                     
                        •
                     . 37. 
                  limitation, and giueth a §. 52. 
                  direction to children, ſo it addeth a ſpur vnto them, to ſtirre them vp to performe their dutie: for it ſheweth that parents are to then children in the Lords ſteed: as an euidence thereof hath God Liberis ſuis pater Dei vice eſt. Greg. Naz. ad Vitit. communicated to them this glorious and honourable title (FATHER) which is See §. 5. proper and peculiar to himſelfe. Now then parents being to their children in Gods ſteed, and by vertue of their place bearing Gods image, children in obeying their parents, obey God; in refuſing to obey them, refuſe to obey God. A ſtrong motiue is this firſt motiue. For who is ſo void of religion, but will thinke it moſt meet, that God ſhould be honoured? or

who ſo impious, as to refuſe to yeeld dutie to God? Here then children may learne in one maine point how to honour the Lord, & ſhew themſelues children of God. And let them here by know, that diſobedient and vndutifull children, that reſiſt the authoritie of parents, reſist the ordinance of God, and receiue to themſelues

               §. 60. Of the equitie whereby children ſhould be moued to obey their parents.
               
               II. The ſecond reaſon in theſe words, for this is right, though it be not of greater force, yet is it more plainly and expreſly noted to be a reaſon, as the cauſall particle (for) prefixed before it, ſheweth. It is a generall reaſon drawne from common equitie; a reaſon which may moue all ſorts, euen Infidels and Pagans: therefore much more Chriſtians.
               In ſaying, It is right, he implieth three things.
               1. That it is agreeable to all law. To the law of God, which 
                     Right implieth three things. 1. It is agreeable to all law. is the fountaine of equitie. To the law of Nature, which proceeds from thence. And to the law of Nations, which is anſwerable in many reſpects. The forenamed proofes out of Gods word, ſhew it to be agreeable to Gods law. The precepts which heathen men haue giuen of this point, ſhew it to be agreeable to the law of nature. And the many Conſtitutions of Law-makers, in all ages, ſhew it to be agreeable to the law of nations.
               
               2. That the place of parents requireth as much. For RIGHT 2. It is due by vertue of parents place. requireth that euery one haue his owne, that which is his due. It being therefore right, that children obey their parents, that dutie 
                     •
                  s due to them.
               3. That parents deſerue as much: for right preſuppoſeth de
                     
                        •
                     ert. 
                  3. It is a debt. That which is done of right, is done by way of recompence. The cauſe of this deſert, is the loue which parents beare to children, the paine, paines, care, and coſt they haue beene at, in bringing them forth, and bringing them vp.
               Theſe things being implied vnder right, note what followeth 
                     •
                  rom the force of this reaſon,
               1. Diſobedient and vndutifull children, tranſgreſſe againſt Gods law, againſt common equitie of all nations, and againſt light 
                        •
                     f nature: ſo as they are vnworthy of the name of Chriſtians, 
                     •
                  hey are worſe then Infidels, yea worſe then the brute beaſts.
               
                  
2. They haue no reſpect to the place of their parents, they diſgrace the image of God, which their parents by vertue of their place carrie, and they diſturbe that comely order and degree, which God hath ſet among men.
               3. They ill repay their parents care and paines for their good, and ſhew themſelues both vngratefull and vnnaturall: which are two moſt monſtrous and odious ſinnes.
            
            
               §. 61. Of Gods accepting childrens obedience.
               
               The forenamed reaſon is by this ſame Apoſtle in another place thus ſet downe, This is well-pleaſing to the Lord. By comparing 
                     Coloſſ. 3. 20. that place with my text, I obſerue, that
               
                  What is right is well-pleaſing to the Lord. And againe, What is well-pleaſing to the Lord is right.
               
               Theſe two propoſitions, are (as we ſpeake in Schooles) conuertible and reciprocall; either of them true of the other euery way. Wherefore the Apoſtle, in another place, ioyneth them both together. For hauing exhorted children to recompence their parents, he ſaith, That is good and acceptable before God. 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  Good or 1 Tim. 5. 4. 
                  honeſt is in effect the ſame that 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  right.
               
               This ſheweth, that dutifull children, as they doe that which is good, or honeſt, and right vnto their parents; ſo alſo therein they highly pleaſe God: ſo as they may be ſure not to loſe thereby. At Gods hand they ſhall receiue a reward, though their parents ſhould little regard their dutifulneſſe. Thus God dealt with Iaakob. His father in law ill repaid his faithfulneſſe: but God looked 
                     Gen. 31. 7, &c. verſ 42. vpon him, and abundantly recompenced all his paines.
               This ſheweth againe, that vndutifull children, as they doe not that which is right, but rather wrong vnto their parents; ſo they highly diſpleaſe God: they may be ſure therefore not to eſcape vnpuniſhed, though their parents, through ouer-much indulgencie, ſhould let them alone: inſtance the two impious children of Elie, Hophni and Phinehas: and the two rebellious children of 1 Sam. 2. 34. 2 Sam. 18. 9. 1 King. 2. 25. 
                  Dauid, Abſolom, and Adoniah.
               
               This therefore addeth force to the ſecond reaſon, and moueth children to doe right to their parents, by obeying them, as they reſpect God, his good pleaſure, or diſpleaſure: as they looke for recompence, or feare vengeance from him.

               III. The third drawne from Gods charge is not only in expreſſe termes noted, but for more weight the very words of the morall law are quoted (Honour thy father and thy mother:) and it is added, that this is a commandement, yea the firſt commandement, and that with promiſe, all which is for amplification of the point.
               
                  
                     
                        Here then conſider we
                        1. The reaſon it ſelfe.
                     
                     
                        2. The amplification thereof.
                         
                     
                  
               
               From the reaſon that it is Gods charge, I gather theſe three points.
               1. That it is no arbitrary matter left to childrens diſcretion Childrens obedience to parents is, 1. No arbitrary thing. whether they will obey their parents or no: but a matter whereunto in conſcience they are bound, euen as they owe alleageance to God himſelfe the great law-giuer: ſo as in neglecting dutie to parents, children ſinne euen againſt God himſelfe: for the ſame God who hath commanded vs to honour himſelfe, hath commanded vs to honour father and mother.
               
               2. That this is a perpetuall and a generall law: a law whereunto 2. An eternall law, and generall to all children. all children of all times, places, ſexes, eſtates and degrees alwaies haue beene, ſtill are, and euer ſhall be bound. For the morall law is of that extent: it is generall for all perſons: perpetuall for all times. Therefore no children may thinke to be exempted from it.
               
                  Queſt. What if children be growne to yeeres, and not vnder their parents gouernment?
                  Anſw. There may be ſome difference both in ſome parts of ſubiection, and alſo in the manner of ſubiection betwixt ſuch children as remaine vnder their parents gouernment, and ſuch as are freed from it: but yet ſo long as a childe hath a parent, of what age or eſtate ſo euer he be, he oweth an honour vnto his parent.

                     Ioſeph when he was a great Gouernour of Egypt, a man growne, hauing wife and children, yet performed the honour of reuerence, obedience, and recompence vnto his father. 1 King. 2. 19. 3. Indiſpenſable. 
                     Salomon when he was in an higher place then Ioſeph, euen an abſolute King, did the honour of Reuerence to his mother.
                  3. That no man can giue children any diſpenſation, or ex

emption from their dutie to parents. If any may, he muſt be either the law-maker himſelfe, or one greater then he, one that hath power ouer him. Now God is the author and giuer of that law, God ſpake all theſe words, &c. But is any greater then 
                        Exo. 20. 1. God? hath any power ouer him? Who then can diſpence with children in this kinde?
                  Hence then I inferre theſe two concluſions.
                  1. That the Popes diſpenſation is nothing worth: they who make it to be of force, muſt make him greater then God, which is a horrible blaſphemy.
                  2. Though parents themſelues ſhould not exact dutie of their children, yet children were bound to performe dutie to them, becauſe of Gods charge. To this therefore are children to looke. This ſheweth that there is no leſſe paine hanging ouer the heads of the tranſgreſſors of this charge, then the curſe of the law, eternall condemnation.
               
            
            
               §. 63. Of the title FIRST giuen to the fift commandement.
               
               In the amplification of the forenamed reaſon, the Apoſtle ſtileth the commandement of honouring parents the firſt with promiſe, as to ſhew that it is the firſt which hath a particular promiſe annexed to it; ſo it is the firſt that God gaue of any dutie to be performed vnto man. The very order of the decalogue manifeſteth the truth hereof. The reaſon is cleere: Honour due to parents is the ground of all the duties required in the ſecond table: for if dutie be not performed to ſuch as we are bound vnto by ſome peculiar bond, may we thinke that it will be performed to ſuch as we are bound vnto at large? Now of all to whom we are firſt and moſt bound, and to whom we owe our firſt dutie, our parents are the perſons. They therefore who are rebellious againſt their parents, and refuſe to doe their dutie to them, will hardly performe dutie to any other. Little hope that a diſobedient childe will proue a profitable member in Church or common-wealth. Abſolom, who was a rebellious childe, proued but a traiterous ſubiect: and Hoph
                        ••
                     
                   and Phineas that refuſed to hearken to the voice of their father, proued but ſacrilegious Prieſts. Wherefore if any precept of the ſecond table be conſcionably to be obſerued (as all are, for the ſame law-maker gaue all, and Chriſt hath ſaid that

                  the ſecond table is like the firſt) then is this of honouring father

                  and mother, among the reſt, and aboue the reſt to be obſerued, at leaſt if difference of obſeruing any may be made,
               But this particle (firſt) being ſet downe, not ſimply but with a connexion of promiſe with it (The firſt with promiſe) we are duly to conſider the promiſe thereof: whence a fourth reaſon ariſeth.
            
            
               §. 64. Of Gods promiſe mouing children to obey their parents.
               
               The fourth reaſon taken from Gods promiſe, is both generally propounded and particularly exemplified. Propounded in this clauſe (firſt with promiſe.) Exemplified in the third verſe.
               For the Generall. Gods promiſe made to the performance of any duty, cannot but be a ſtrong motiue to ſtirre vs vp to performe it. Men hereby doe ſtirre vp, and prouoke one another Promiſe of reward a great motiue. to performe any thing. Thus Kings when they would faine haue their ſubiects doe this or that, promiſe ſuch and ſuch rewards vnto them: Thus maſters incite their ſeruants, parents their children, and one man another. If the promiſes of men incourage vs to performe the things which they giue vs in charge, how much more ought the promiſe of God? Men How Gods promiſe is a ſtronger motiue then any mans.

               This motiue doth exceedingly commend Gods fatherly

indulgencie towards vs, and the earneſt deſire he hath of our good. For he hath ſuch power and authoritie ouer all his creatures, that the very knowledge of his will ought to prouoke them to performe any dutie which he ſhall command: and if they obey not, he might preſently execute vengeance vpon them. But conſidering that we are his children, and need many allurements to draw vs on by little and little, he accordingly dealeth with vs. He ſtandeth not wholly and only vpon his authoritie, but addeth promiſes thereto: (for this is a commandement with promiſe.) If notwithſtanding all this, children refuſe to obey their parents, may not the Lord iuſtly expoſtulate the matter with them, as ſometimes in another caſe he did with the Iſraelites, and ſay, Iudge betweene me and theſe children: 
                  
                     Iſa. 5. 3, 4. 
                  what could I haue done more that I haue not done? I gaue them an expreſſe charge to honour their parents: I laid it downe in the firſt place as a maine and principall charge: to incourage them to keepe it, I added a promiſe of good to redound to themſelues: what could I doe more? Doe not they iustly deſerue vengeance that regard none of theſe? Thus, in that this is a commandement with promiſe, we ſee how children diſobedient to their parents are both rebellious againſt God in regard of the commandement which they tranſgreſſe, and iniurious to themſelues in regard of the promiſe which they make to be void and of no effect. Of this particular promiſe ſee more in the firſt treatiſe, §. 97, 98, &c.

               The ſtreames ſhall be diuided into two riuers.
               In the firſt are thoſe generall duties that are continually to be done.
               In the ſecond, ſuch particular duties as are to be applied to the ſeuerall ages of children.
               There are two principall generall duties.

                     1. Faithfull prayer to God.
                     2. Vpright walking with God.
                  
               
               All the particulars may be compriſed vnder this one head, A prouident care. And this hath reſpect,

                     1. To the Infancy of children,
                     2. To their Youth,
                     
                     3. To the time of their placing forth,
                     4. To the time of parents departing out of this world.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 2. Of that Loue which parents owe to their children.
               
               The Fountaine of parents duties is Loue. 
                  
                     Tit. 2. 4. This is expreſly enioyned to them. Many approued examples are recorded hereof: as 
                     Gen. 22. 2. 
                  Abrahams, 
                  
                     & 25. 28.

                  Ibid. 
                  Rebekahs, and others.
               Great reaſon there is why this affection ſhould be faſt fixed in the heart of parents towards their children. For great is that paine, paines, coſt, and care, which parents muſt vndergoe

for their children. But if loue be in them, no paine, paines, coſt, or care, will ſeeme too much. Herein appeareth the wiſe prouidence of God, who by nature hath ſo faſt fixed loue in the hearts of parents, as if there be any in whom it aboundeth not, he is counted vnnaturall. If loue did not abound in parents, many children would be neglected and loſt. For if parents look not to their children, who will? If none looke to them, they muſt needs periſh: for they are not able to helpe themſelues. As God by nature hath planted loue in all parents, ſo Chriſtians ought euen for conſcience ſake, to nouriſh, increaſe, and blow vp this fire of loue, that they may thereby be made more forward to doe euery duty with cheerefulneſſe. The more feruent loue is, the more readily will euery duty be performed. As I haue heretofore laid downe Loue a fountaine of wiues, husbands, and childrens duties; ſo muſt I continue my courſe, and ſet it forth as the fountaine of parents duties. For the Scripture hath noted it as a dutie belonging to all and euery of them: and therefore I might not omit it in any of them. Yet let not any thereupon thinke, that the ſame point is oft handled, and repeated againe and againe. For according to the ſeuerall parties, and the ſeuerall relation they haue to others, there are ſeuerall fruits of loue: euen as the ſame moiſture of the earth cauſeth ſeuerall and diuers fruits, according to the ſeuerall kindes of plants that receiue that moiſture. Compare the ſeuerall places, where this generall duty of loue hath beene handled, and you will finde the manner of handling to be different, and to afford new matter.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. As too much fire is dangerous, ſo too much loue.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. True. Wherefore as in other things, ſo in this, the golden meane muſt be kept. No dutie ſo holy and neceſſarie, 
                        •
                     ut may be peruerted. Let the extremes be auoided, and the meane will better be kept.

Among theſe, barbarous idolaters doe moſt exceed in this kinde of vnnaturall cruelty, ſacrificing their children, and offering them vp to deuils.

They who haue beene among the Sauadges in Virginea, Florida, India, and other like places teſtifie that ſuch cruelty is vſed to this day. And it is rendred as a maine reaſon why, notwithſtanding ſuch ſpacious places as they haue, they increaſe no more in multitude, becauſe many of their children from time to time are offered vp in ſacrifice.
               Reaſonable men herein ſhew themſelues more vnreaſonable then vnreaſonable beaſts, which doe what poſſibly they can to preſerue their young ones.
               Though not ſo high, yet too high on this ladder of vnnaturalneſſe Haters of children for piety. doe they climbe, who hate their children, and that (which maketh the ſin to be out of meaſure ſinful) for piety and integrity; as many Popiſh and profane parents, who haue children truly religious: and in that reſpect ought ſo much the more to be loued.
               The extreme in the exceſſe is too much doting vpon children: Doting on children. as they doe who ſo vnmeaſurably loue them, as they make reckoning of nothing in compariſon of children. Euen God himſelfe is lightly eſteemed, his worſhip neglected, his word tranſgreſſed, all dutie to others omitted, their owne ſoules forgotten thorow care of children. Is not this mee

               Though praier be a generall dutie which all Chriſtians owe Praier a peculiar dutie of parents. one to another, yet after a peculiar manner doth it appertaine to parents: and of all others they are moſt bound to it. For the promiſe which God maketh to a parent is extended to his ſeed and children, as theſe and ſuch like Scriptures ſhew, 
                     Gen. 17. 7. 
                  I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed: 
                  
                     Deut. 5. 29. 
                  That it may be well with them and with their children: 
                  
                     Act. 2. 39. 
                  The promiſe is vnto you, and vnto your children. Parents therefore with moſt aſſurance of faith may call vpon God for their children. For Gods promiſe is the ground of faith: ſo farre as Gods promiſe is extended, ſo farre our faith may and ought to extend it ſelfe. Hence hath ariſen the commendable cuſtome of childrens asking Treat 5. §. 9. their parents bleſſing: which intimateth a deſire that parents would pray for Gods bleſſing on them.
               This dutie of praier muſt be performed before parents haue children (that they may haue ſome, as 
                     Gen. 25. 21. 
                  Iſaak, 
                  1 Sam. 1. 10. Paulam antè votis quàm vtero concepiſti. Hier. ad 1 aet.
                   
                  Annah and others did 
                     Gen. 25. 21.) and ſo ſoone as children are conceiued, eſpecially if they obſerue them to be quicke in the wombe (as 
                     Gen. 25. 22. 
                  Rebekah did) and againe when they are borne (as 
                     Luk. 1. 64. 
                  Zachariah did) and thorowout the whole courſe of their life (as 
                     Iob. 1. 5. 
                  Iob did) and when they are going out of this world, and leauing their children (as 
                     Gen. 27. 4. 
                  Iſaak did.)
               There is no one thing wherein and whereby parents may doe more good for their children, then in and by true praier. God hath ſanctified praier as a meanes to receiue all needfull bleſſing from himſelfe the fountaine of all bleſſing. If therefore Gods bleſſing be of vſe to children (what Atheiſts are they that beleeue it not?) then alſo is praier by which it is obtained.
            
            
               §. 5. Of vices contrary to parents praying for their children.
               
               The very neglect of this dutie is a ſinne contrary to the dutie Parents neglect of praier. it ſelfe: and many parents there be that ſtand guilty of this ſinne. Some thinke it needleſſe to pray for a childe before it be borne, not conſidering that in ſinne it is conceiued. When it is borne they referre this dutie to the midwife, whereas it

properly appertaineth to the father. After it is growne to any ripeneſſe, they put it off to the childe to pray for it ſelfe. And when they are on their death-bed, they thinke it enough if they can pray for their owne ſoules. Such parents ſhew little true loue to their children: but leſſe faith in God.
               But what may we ſay or thinke of ſuch impious parents as Parents imprecations againſt children. feare not to make fearefull imprecations againſt their children? God oft in wrath and vengeance heareth ſuch imprecations to the woe of parent and childe: whereby he ſheweth his great indignation againſt them for the ſame.
            
            
               §. 6. Of parents endeauouring to be righteous that they may leaue Gods bleſſing to their children.
               
               Another generall branch proceeding from parents loue to their children, is, that for their childrens ſake they endeauour to walke vprightly before God, and to pleaſe him. This I doe the rather note, becauſe I finde the reward promiſed to righteous parents to be extended vnto their children 
                     Pſal. 1. 12. 2. 
                  The generation of the righteous ſhall be bleſſed, ſaith Dauid. And Salomon, 
                  
                     Pro. 20. 7. 
                  Bleſſed ſhall his children be after him: and againe, 
                     & 13. 22. 
                  The good man ſhall giue inheritance vnto his childrens children. 
                  
                     Deut. 5. 29. This motiue is therefore vrged by the holy Ghoſt to prouoke parents vnto all righteouſneſſe.
               Thus doth the Lord extend the reward of righteous parents vnto their children to ſhew his great good liking, and high approbation of righteouſneſſe. Reade for this purpoſe, 1 King. 11. 34. & 2 King. 10. 30.
               
                  1. Obiect. 
                     
                        Ezec. 18. 20. 
                     The righteouſneſſe of the righteous ſhall be vpon himſelfe.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. That is meant rather of a mans perſonall righteouſneſſe, and grace it ſelfe which is not communicated to children, then of the fruit thereof: That faith in Chriſt, feare of God, obedience to Gods word, or any other perſonall grace which is in righteous parents, ſhall not iuſtifie or ſaue their children. For the iuſt ſhall liue by his owne faith. Yet this hindereth 
                        Hab. 2. 4. not but that the benefit and bleſſing of righteous parents may fall vpon their children according to the extent of Gods promiſe.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. By experience we finde it verified, that the children

of ſome righteous parents are curſed: and the Scripture giueth vs many examples thereof: as 
                        Gen. 4. 11. 
                     Cain,

                     2 Sam. 18. 15.

                  1. Anſw. Such children by their vnworthy, and degenerat cariage make forfeiture of Gods couenant and 1 Sam. 2. 30. ſo depriue themſelues of the benefit thereof.
                  2. Anſw. Many good reaſons may be giuen why God ſhould ſometimes alter his courſe, and with-hold his bleſſings from the children of his ſeruants. As
                  1. Leſt Gods gifts and bleſſings ſhould otherwiſe ſeeme to come rather by naturall propagation from the parent, then by free donation from God.
                  2. Leſt parents ſhould thereby be drawne to neglect the meanes of good education.
                  3. Leſt children alſo themſelues, truſting too much to their parents righteouſneſſe, ſhould take too much liberty, and waxe licentious.
                  4. Leſt Gods free election ſhould ſeeme hereby to be reſtrained.
               
               
                  3. Obiect.
                  
                  If this be ſo, what motiue can it be vnto parents to labour after righteouſneſſe for their childrens ſake?
                  
                     Anſw. Though God doe reſerue in himſelfe a freedome to order his bleſſings as it pleaſeth him, and to beſtow them vpon whom he will: and thereupon ſometimes bleſſeth the childe of a wicked parent (inſtance 2 Chr. 28. 27. 
                     Hezekiah) & denieth his bleſſing to the childe of a righteous parent (inſtance 2 Sam. 13. 14, 29. Relinque bonam filijs memoriam magis quàm diuitias multas. Baſ ſerm. in Scrip. loc.
                      
                     Ammon) yet in that it is a very vſuall courſe with him to extend his bleſſing (according to his promiſe) to the children of the righteous, it is a ſtrong motiue to ſuch as deſire the good of their children, the rather for their childrens ſake to endeauour after righteouſneſſe: for thus doe they vſe the meanes which by Gods word is warranted and ſanctified for procuring Gods bleſſing to their children. Leaue therefore a good memory to thy children rather then much wealth.
               
            
            
               §. 7. Of the prepoſterous courſe which couetous and vniuſt parents take for the good of their children.
               
               Contrary is the courſe of ſuch parents as by vnrighteous meanes thinke to prouide well for their children. For many

doe not only too carkingly, and diſtruſtfully moile and toile to ſcrape together great maſſes of money, or great ſtore of land, or other ſtockes for their children, neglecting duties of piety and mercy, but alſo by vniuſt and wrongfull courſes defraud others to make their children rich. So common is this vndue courſe of prouiding for children, as thence hath ariſen this prouerbe, Happy are thoſe children whoſe parents goe to the deuill. A curſed prouerbe. For what other thing can it intend, but this, that they who feare not God, nor take care for their owne ſaulation, will haue moſt reſpect to the outward eſtate of their children, and be moſt carefull to make them great, and rich in this world? Wherein note how many waies they bewray their notorious folly.
               1. They preferre the outward eſtate of their children before the eternall ſaluation of their owne ſoules. Yea and before God himſelfe.
               2. They place the happineſſe of their children in the goods of this world; 
                     Pro. 23. 5. then which nothing more vaine.
               3. They make themſelues drudges to their children, and ſo debaſe themſelues below that dignity which by reaſon of Gods image on them, appertaineth to them.
               4. They with much paines, care, griefe, and feare are long gathering that which their children in ſhort time moſt riotouſly and prodigally will lauiſh out.
               5. They make themſelues vaſſals to Satan and ſeeke by him to be made rich: whereas indeed 
                     Tro. 10. 22. 
                  it is the bleſſing of God that maketh rich. Thus they take a wrong courſe to get wealth. If it be ſaid that many are thus made rich, I anſwer, that as 
                     Hoſ. 13. 11. Ne liberos praetexas. Qui enim filium fecit, & te fecit: qui etiam tibi occaſiones nutriend praebet, & filio praebebit vitae ſubſidia. Baſil. loc. 
                           •
                        it.
                   God gaue a King to Iſraell, ſo he giueth wealth to them, in wrath: and in wrath will he take it away.
               6. They bring Gods curſe into their houſe, and leaue it vnto their children: So as theſe are the riches that are reſerued to the owners thereof for their euill. Let not therefore care for children draw thee to any coueteous or vniuſt courſes: but know that he who made thy ſonne made thee alſo, and he who affoorded thee meanes of nouriſhment, will alſo affoord thy children ſufficient ſuccour.
            
            
               
               §. 8. Of Parents prouidence for their children. 
                  How farre parents prouidence extendeth it ſelfe.
               
               The head, whereunto all the particular duties, which parents owe to their children, may be referred, is A prouident care for their childrens good. This extendeth it ſelfe to all times, and to all things.
               
               To all times, as to the infancie, youth, and man-age of their children: and that not only while parents liue, but after their departure.
               To all things, namely, tending both to the temporall good of their children, and alſo to their ſpirituall good.
               
               Children are of the very ſubſtance of their parents, & therefore ought parents ſo farre to ſeeke their childrens good as their owne.
               The patternes of holy parents recorded and commended in Scripture, doe liuely ſet forth this prouident care.
               But this generall we will exemplifie in the particulars: and in order declare how parents muſt prouide both for the temporall, and alſo for the ſpirituall good of their children in euery degree of their age.
               They who at any time in any thing are negligent and careleſſe of their childrens good, offend in the contrary to this generall dutie. The heinouſneſſe of which offences will appeare in the particulars.
            
            
               §. 9. Of a mothers care ouer her childe while it is in her wombe.
               
               The firſt age of a childe is the infancie thereof. I will therefore firſt ſhew how therein parents muſt procure the temporall good of their children, and then their ſpirituall good.
               The firſt part of a childs infancie is while it remaineth in the mothers wombe. Here therefore the dutie lieth principally vpon the mother: who ſo ſoone as ſhe perceiueth a childe to be conceiued in her wombe, ought to haue an eſpeciall care thereof, that (ſo much as in her lieth) the childe may be ſafely brought forth. (
                     Grauidae corpora curare debent. Mens item earum quietem deſiderat. Quae enim procreantur à matre in cuius aluo continentur, alimentum capiunt, vt à terra ea-quae gignantur ex ea. Ariſt. Pol. lib. 7. The heathen Philoſophen, by light of nature, obſerued this to be a dutie; and preſcribed it to mothers.) A mother then muſt haue a tender care ouer her ſelfe when ſhee is with childe: for the childe being lodged in her, and receiuing nouriſhment from her (as plants from the earth) her well-being tendeth much to the good and ſafetie of the childe: but the hurt that commeth to her, maketh the childe the worſe, if it be not a meanes to deſtroy it.

Why was the charge of 
                     Iudg. 13. 4. 
                  abſtaining from wine, ſtrong drinke, and vncleane things, giuen to Manoahs wife, but becauſe of the childe which ſhe conceiued?
               In this caſe there is a double bond to make mothers carefull of themſelues.

                     
                        1. Their owne,
                     
                     
                        2. Their childs good.
                  
               
               Husbands alſo in this caſe muſt be very tender ouer their wiues, and helpfull to them in all things needfull, both in regard of that dutie which they owe to their wiues, and alſo of that they 
                     Iudg. 13. 11, &c.
                   owe to their children. Why was Manoah ſo deſirous to heare himſelfe the forenamed direction which the Angell gaue to his wife? and why did the Angell againe repeat it to him, but to ſhew it belonged to him to ſee her obſerue it?
               They who through violence of paſſion, whether of griefe, or Contrary. anger, or through violent motion of the bodie, as by dancing, ſtriuing, 1. To miſcarry through negligence. running, galloping on horſebacke, or the like: or through diſtemper of the bodie, by eating things hurtfull, by eating too much, by too much abſtinence, by too much baſhfulneſſe in concealing their deſires and longings (as we ſpeake) cauſe any abortion or miſcariage, fall into the offence contrary to the forenamed dutie. If women were perſwaded that in conſcience they are bound to the forenamed dutie, they would, I thinke, be more carefull of themſelues. For if through their default, they themſelues or their childe miſcarry, they make themſelues guilty of that miſcariage: if both miſcarry, they make themſelues guiltie of the bloud of both; at leaſt in the court of conſcience before God.
               But they who purpoſely take things to make away their children 2. To make away a childe in the wombe. Omne quod formatam animam à Deo accepit vindie abitur ſi iniuſlè interimatur. Conſtit. Apoſt. l. 7. c. 4. in their wombe, are in farre higher degree guiltie of bloud: yea euen of wilfull murther. For that which hath receiued a ſoule formed in it by God, if it be vniuſtly caſt away, ſhall be reuenged.
               So farre forth as husbands are careleſſe of their wiues being with childe, denying them things needfull, they are acceſſarie to the hurt, which the woman, or childe taketh, guiltie of the ſin, and liable to the iudgement.
            
            
               §. 10. Of prouiding things needfull for the childe, ſo ſoone as it is borne: and of crueltie contrary thereunto.
               
               The next degree of a childs infancie, is while it is in the ſwadling

bands, and remaineth a ſucking childe. In this alſo the care eſpecially lieth vpon the mother: yet ſo as the father muſt afford what helpe he can.
               The firſt dutie here required is, that ſufficient prouiſion of all things needfull for a childe in that weakneſſe be before hand prouided. What the particulars be, women better know, then I can expreſſe. For me, it is ſufficient, to lay downe the dutie in generall: which is commended vnto vs in that worthy patterne of the Virgin Marie, who though ſhe were very poore, and forced to trauell farre, and brought to bed in a ſtrange place, where ſhe was ſo little reſpected, as ſhe was not afforded a place meet for a woman in her caſe, but was faine to content her ſelfe with a ſtable in a common Inne, yet ſhe prouided for her childe. For it is ſaid, She wrapped him in ſwadling clothes, Luk 2. 7.
               Contrary is the practiſe of ſuch lewd and vnnaturall women, as leaue their new-borne children vnder ſtalls, at mens doores, in Church porches, yea many times in open field. It is noted as a point of vnnaturalneſſe in the Oſtrich, to leaue her eggs in the earth, and in the duſt: in which reſpect ſhe is ſaid to be hardned againſt her young ones, as though they were not hers, Iob 39. 14, 16. Much more hardned are the foreſaid lewd women. The Eagle is 
                     Iniquiffima volucris Aquila dicitur, quiae taedio nutriendi pullum quem genuit, ipſa fugat. Tales parentes ij ſunt, qui liberos ſuos infantes exponunt. Baſil. Hexam. hom. 8.

Digeſt. l, 25. tit. 3. §. 4. 1 Pet. 2. 2. counted an vnnaturall bird, becauſe ſhe thruſteth her young ones, which ſhe hath brought forth, out of her neſt. Are not then ſuch mothers much more vnnaturall? They oft lay their children forth in publike places, for others to ſhew that mercy, which they themſelues haue not. The Ciuill Law iudgeth this to be a kinde of further.
            
            
               §. 11. Of giuing ſucke to children.
               
               Among other needfull things, the milke of the breaſt is fit for

manner of nouriſhing little infants after this manner, commended in the Scriptures: and (to conclude) the naturall inſtinct which many vnreaſonable creatures haue thus to nouriſh their young ones.
               They who on meere curioſitie (where no vrgent neceſſitie requireth) try whether their children may not as birds be nouriſhed without ſucke, offend contrary to this dutie; and reiect that meanes which God hath ordained as the beſt: and ſo oppoſe their ſhallow wit to his vnſearchable wiſdome.
            
            
               §. 12. Of mothers giuing ſucke to their owne children.
               
               Of nouriſhing children with breſt-milke, there is no great queſtion: therefore I haue with a touch paſſed it ouer. The chiefeſt queſtion of doubt is concerning the partie who is bound to this dutie; namely, whether the mother be bound to doe it her ſelfe or no.
               Many ſtrong arguments there be to preſſe it vpon the conſciences Poſtquam ablactaueris cam, &c. dixit Hier. ad Laetam de filia ſua. of mothers, and to ſhew that (ſo farre as they are able) they are bound to giue ſucke to their owne children. Some are taken from the light of Gods word; and ſome from the light of nature.
               Gods word doth in many places by iuſt conſequence imply, that it is a bounden dutie: in other places it doth expreſly commend it by the practiſe of holy women: and againe in other places it taketh it for a granted truth, and ruled caſe, not to be denied.
               1. The conſequences whereby the word implieth this dutie are theſe:
               1. In the bleſſing giuen to Ioſeph thus ſpeaketh old Iaakob, God ſhall bleſſe thee with the bleſſing of the breaſts, and of the 
                  
                     Gen. 49. 25. 
                  wombe. By the bleſſing of the wombe, what can be meant, but children? By the bleſſing of the breaſts, what, but milke, whereby thoſe children are nouriſhed? As if he had ſaid; I will bleſſe thee with ſuch women, as ſhall both beare thee children, and alſo giue ſucke to them which they beare. The conſequence then is this: As it is a bleſſing to haue children of a true lawfull wife; ſo to haue thoſe children nurſed of the ſame wife their mother.
               
                  
                     Obiect. They haue the bleſſing of breaſts that haue other women to nurſe their children.
                  
                     Anſw. By the ſame reaſon it may be ſaid, they haue the bleſſing

of the wombe who haue ſtrange women to beare them children. But the ioyning of theſe two branches of bleſſing together, ſheweth that both muſt be taken in the ſame kinde: ſo that as the bleſſing of the wombe is to haue children of a mans wife, ſo the bleſſing of the breaſts is to haue them nurſed of his wife. If it be a bleſſing for the woman which beareth the childe to giue it ſucke, then mothers are bound to performe this dutie.
                  2. It is denounced as a curſe, that women ſhall haue a barren 
                     
                        Oſe. 9. 14. 
                     wombe and drie breaſts. If it be a curſe for women to haue drie breaſts, then may not women wittingly make them drie: which all mothers doe, that giue not ſucke to their children.
                  3. Manoahs wife being promiſed to beare a ſonne, had this charge giuen her, Drinke no wine, nor ſtrong drinke. &c. thoſe things were eſpecially hurtfull for her milke. It is therefore implied thereby, that ſhe ſhould ſo order her diet, as ſhe might well nurſe her childe, and haue good milke for him.
                  4. God by his good prouidence brought it to paſſe, that the mother of Moſes (though ſhe were forced to caſt out her 
                        Exo. 2. 7, &c.
                      childe) ſhould nurſe her owne childe. Yea the mother her ſelfe was deſirous to doe it, and therefore appointed her daughter 
                        •
                     o watch who ſhould take it vp. Theſe two circumſtances 
                        •
                     mplie that it appertaineth to a mother to nurſe her children.
                  5. The Apoſtle layeth this downe as a note of a good woman, 1. Tim. 5. 10. who in her place hath beene carefull to doe her dutie, 
                        •
                     nd thereupon fit to doe ſeruice in Gods Church (If ſhe haue 
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     
                        
                           •
                        ouriſhed her children, or word for word, If ſhe haue fed her children.) Now the proper food for young babes is breaſt-milk, which, by the Apoſtles rule, the mother muſt giue.
                  6. The ſame Apoſtle commandeth mothers to loue their 
                     
                        Tit. 2. 4. 
                     children. How can a mother better expreſſe her loue to her 
                        •
                     oung babe, then by letting it ſucke of her owne breaſts? As his is a teſtimony of loue, ſo it is a meanes of preſeruing and increaſing loue: for daily experience ſheweth that mothers 
                        •
                     ue thoſe children beſt to whom they themſelues giue ſucke.
                  Summe theſe ſeuerall conſequences together, and we 
                        •
                     all finde the dutie in queſtion to be very ſtrongly inforced hereby.

                        
                           
1. As a bleſſing it is promiſed, that mothers ſhall giue ſucke to the children that they beare.
                        2. As a curſe it is threatned, that women ſhall not be able to giue ſucke.
                        3. An Angell gaue direction to a mother ſo to carrie her ſelfe as ſhe might haue ſtore of good milke for the childe which ſhe ſhould beare.
                        4. God by his ſpeciall prouidence manifeſted that the proper mother was the beſt nurſe for a childe.
                        5. It is the note of a good woman to performe this part of her particular calling, namely to nurſe her owne childe.
                        6. Women ought to doe all the beſt duties of loue that they can to their children.
                     
                  
                  Therefore mothers ought to nurſe their owne children.
                  II. Some of the moſt worthy patternes, in whoſe example this dutie is commended to mothers, are theſe.
                  1. Sarah gaue ſucke to Iſaak. This example is to be noted 
                        Gen. 21. 7. eſpecially of the greater ſort: as rich mens wiues, honourable mens wiues, and the like. For Sarah was an honourable woman, a princeſſe, a rich mans wife, a beautifull woman, aged and well growne in yeeres, and a miſtreſſe of a family.
                  Are not theſe excuſes pretended by many mothers for not nurſing children themſelues?
                  2. The virgin Mary gaue ſucke to Ieſus. This example is to be noted eſpecially of the meaner ſort, for the virgin Man was young, poore, perſecuted, forced to remoue and flie with her childe from countrie to countrie. Are not theſe excuſes pretended by other mothers?
                  Theſe two patternes doe not only commend the duty, but alſo ſtrippe all mothers that are negligent therein, of all excuſe.
                  To theſe may be added the examples of 1 Sam. 1. 22. 
                     Annah, of 
                        Pſal. 22. 9. 
                     Dauids mother, and of many others. What if alſo I adde the example of that true, naturall, affectionate mother who ſtood before Salomons throne to plead for her childe? ſhe thus ſaith of her ſelfe, 1 King. 3. 21. 
                     I aroſe to giue my ſonne ſucke, &c. If this had not beene a good motherly dutie, ſhe would not then and there haue pleaded it.
                  
                     
III. The places of Scripture which take this dutie for a matter granted, and for a ruled caſe, are ſuch as theſe.
                  1. Where Sarah ſaith, Who would haue ſaid to Abram that 
                     
                        Gen. 21. 7. 
                     Sarah ſhould haue giuen children ſucke? In this phraſe ſhe ſetteth forth Gods bleſſing in giuing Abram a ſonne by her. Now in that ſhe expreſſeth the bleſſing vnder this phraſe of giuing ſucke, ſhe taketh it for grant, that the mother which beareth children muſt giue them ſucke.
                  2. Where Dauid ſaith, thou diddeſt make me hope vpon my 
                     
                        Pſal. 22. 9. 
                     mothers breaſts, he doth not onely imply that his mother gaue him ſucke, but by the phraſe maketh it a ruled caſe that the childe which ſuckes muſt hang vpon the mothers breaſt.
                  3. Where Salomon ſaith, O that thou wert as my brother that 
                     
                        Cant. 8. 1. 
                     ſucked the breaſts of my mother, he taketh if alſo for grant, that brothers and ſiſters, as they come out of the ſame wombe, ſo they ſhould ſucke the ſame breaſts, euen the breaſts of her out of whoſe wombe they came, their owne mothers breaſts.
                  4. Where the woman ſaid to Chriſt, Bleſſed is the wombe that 
                     
                        Luk. 11. 27. 
                     bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked, ſhe taketh it for grant (as it was an vſuall practiſe in thoſe daies) that the 
                        •
                     aps of that woman, whoſe wombe beare him, gaue him Ipſa ſuggerit natura matribus ipſis lactandos eſſe ſuos foetus. Idoirco enim animanti enixae lactis alimentum omni praebuit▪ Sapiens verò etiam prouidentia mammas foeminis binas effinxit, &c. Plut. de Juſtit. lib. In ijs animantibus quae lacte aluntur, omnis ferè cibus lacteſcere incipit. Cic. de Nat. D. 
                     
                        •
                     ucke.
                  Theſe arguments we haue from the light of Gods word: other we may haue from Gods workes and the light of nature, as
                  1. God hath giuen to women two breaſts fit to containe 
                        •
                     nd hold milke: and nipples vnto them fit to haue milke drawne from them. Why are theſe thus giuen? to lay them 
                        •
                     rth for oſtentation? There is no warrant for that in all Gods 
                        •
                     ord. They are directly giuen for the childs food that commeth out of the wombe; for till the childe be borne, there is 
                        •
                     o milke in the breaſts: anon after it is borne, milke ordinari
                     
                        ••
                      floweth into the breaſts: yea a great part of the meat which 
                        ••
                     ey eat turneth into milke. They make this admirable worke 
                        •
                     f Gods prouidence to be in vaine, that drie vp this ſpring, 
                        ••
                     d ſuffer not their children to partake of the benefit of it.
                  2. That nouriſhment whereon the childe fed in the mo
                     
                        ••
                     ers wombe, and whereby it was there ſuſtained, turneth into

milke, and commeth into the breaſts when the childe commeth out of the wombe. Whence we may gather, that of all womens milke, that womans milke is fitteſt for the childe, out of whoſe wombe the childe came.
                  3. Together with the milke paſſeth ſome ſmacke of the 
                        Mater Bernardi liberos ſuos alienis vberibus nutriendos committere refugiebat, quaſi cum lacte materno materni quodammodo boni infundens eis naturam. Guil. Abb. de vit. Bern. l. 1. c. 1. affection and diſpoſition of the mother: which maketh mothers to loue ſuch children beſt as they haue giuen ſucke vnto: yea and oft times ſuch children as haue ſucked their mothers breaſts, loue their mothers beſt: yea we may obſerue many who haue ſucked others milke, to loue thoſe nurſes all the daies of their life.
                  4. Other things are nouriſhed by the ſame that they are bred. The earth out of which plants grow, miniſtreth nouriſhment to the ſaid plants: trees that bring forth fruit yeeld ſap to that fruit, whereby it groweth to ripeneſſe: vnreaſonable creatures, and among them the moſt ſauage wilde beaſts, as Tigers and Dragons, yea ſea-monſters giue ſucke to their young ones; whereupon the Prophet ſaith of women that giue not ſucke 
                        Lam. 4. 3. to their Children, that they are more cruell then thoſe ſeamonſters, Like the Oſtriches in the wilderneſſe: for the cruell Oſtrich, and the hatefull Cucco are the two kinde of creatures which are noted to leaue their young ones for others to nouriſh; the Oſtrich leaueth her eggs in the duſt: the Cucco leaueth hers in other birds neſts. Other creatures (if nature afford them not milke and dugges, as to birds it doth not) feed their young ones other waies, yet by themſelues.
                  5. Shall I adde another argument which daily experience confirmeth, namely Gods bleſſing vpon this motherly dutie: Matres maiore ſtudio & cura nutrient, nempe ex ipſis viſceribus diligunt liberos ſuos. Cum nutrices vtpote quae mercedem ament, charitatem praebeant ſubditiciam. Plut. de Inſtit. lib. commonly ſuch children as are nurſed by their mothers, proſper beſt. Mothers are moſt tender ouer them, and cannot indure to let them lie crying out, without taking them vp. and ſtilling them; as nurſes will let them crie and crie againe, if they be about any buſineſſe of their owne. For who are commonly choſen to be nurſes? euen poore countrie women which haue much worke to doe, and little helpe; and ſo are forced to let the childe lie and crie, many times till it burſt againe. Children nurſed by their mothers are for the moſt part more cleanly, and neatly brought vp, freer from diſeaſes;

not ſo many die; I am ſure not ſo many through negligence caſt away. The number of nurſe children that die euery yeere is very great. It hath beene obſerued in many countrie villages, that the moſt part, that from time to time die there, are nurſe children. Are not mothers that might haue nurſed their owne children if they would, acceſſary to the death of thoſe that are caſt away by the nurſes negligence?
                  On theſe and other like reaſons heathen women, and very 
                        Ariſt. Oecon. l. 2. c. 3. Plutarch. loc. citat. A. Gellius Noct. Attic. comment. li. 12. cap. 1. ſauages, haue in all ages beene moued to nurſe their owne children: and ſome heathen Philoſophers haue vrged and preſſed the neceſſitie of this dutie. Neuer was it more neglected, then among thoſe that beare the name of Chriſtians.
                  Let mothers know of what ranke or degree ſo euer they be, that (out of the caſe of neceſſitie) they haue no warrant to put forth their children to others to nurſe. We read not in all the Scripture of any holy women that euer did it.
               
            
            
               §. 13. Of the obiections for putting children forth to nurſe.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Many nurſes are mentioned in Scripture, as Rebekahs 
                     
                        Gen. 24. 59. 2 Sam. 4. 4. 2 King. 11. 2. nurſe, Mephiboſheths nurſe, Ioaſh his nurſe, and others.
                  1. Anſw. Such nurſes mentioned in Scripture were commonly drie nurſes. Rebekahs nurſe went with her before ſhe was maried: how can it be thought that ſhe was a milch nurſe? Could they tell when Rebekah ſhould haue a childe? or when 
                        Gen. 35. 8. he had one, that Deborah (the nurſe there mentioned) ſhould haue milke for her? It is ſaid that Naomi became nurſe to Ruths 
                     
                        Ruth 4. 16. & 1. 12. 
                     
                        
                           •
                        hilde: now Naomi was old, long before this ſhe was paſt 
                        •
                     hild-bearing, without an husband for many yeeres: how then was it poſſible that ſhe ſhould giue ſucke? She was therefore a 
                        •
                     rie nurſe, as other nurſes mentioned in Scripture.
                  2. Anſw. The mothers of thoſe children which are ſaid to 
                        •
                     aue nurſes (if thoſe nurſes were milch-nurſes) might be 
                        •
                     ead: or if liuing, not able to giue ſucke for want of milke, 
                        •
                     ipple, or for ſome other like defect: or if able, ſinne in putting forth their children.
                  3. Anſw. Though it be ſaid that there were nurſes, yet is no where ſaid, that a mother put forth her childe to ſucke.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. Pharohs daughter put forth the childe which ſhe 
                        Exod. 2. 7. 
                     
                        ••
                     oke for her owne to nurſe.
                  
                     
                     Anſw. She bare not this childe, nor was the naturall mother of it, ſo as this is nothing to the purpoſe. Yea it maketh againſt the obiectors, in that the true mother of this childe nurſed it.
               
               
                  3. Obiect. The metaphor taken from nurſes is oft vſed, 
                        Num. 11. 12. 1 Theſ. 2. 7. and applied to God, and to Gods miniſters.
                  1. Anſw. The vſing of a thing by way of compariſon and reſemblance doth not ſimply iuſtifie it: inſtance the parable of the vniuſt ſteward, and of a theefe. 
                        Luke 16. 1. &c. Reu. 15. 16.
                  
                  2. Anſw. The metaphor may be taken from a drie nurſe as well as a milch nurſe: for the compariſons are not vſed of giuing ſucke, but of bearing and carrying in armes, as drie nurſes vſe to carry children.
                  3. Anſw. The metaphors are moſt fitly taken from mothers that are nurſes to their owne children.
               
               
                  4. Obiect. Many mothers haue not ſuch skill in giuing ſucke as nurſes haue.
                  
                     Anſw. Let them learne ſeeing it is their dutie.
               
               
                  5. Obiect. Mothers that are of great wealth and high place cannot endure the paine of nurſing, nor take the paines in handling young children as they muſt be handled.
                  1. Anſw. The greateſt that be muſt ſet themſelues to doe that duty which God requireth at their hands, though it be with paine and paines. Note Sarahs example before recorded.
                  2. Anſw. By this it appeareth, that if other women could beare their children in the wombe nine moneths, and endure the paine of trauell for them, they would hire them to doe it. But ſeeing they doe the one (namely beare and bring forth their owne children with hard labour) why ſhould they not doe the other? If they ſay there is an vnauoidable neceſſity of bearing and bringing forth their children; I anſwer, that conſcience ought to moue them to nurſe thoſe children, which neceſſity forceth them to bring forth. God by this latter o
                        •
                      nurſing children maketh triall of women whether they will for conſcience ſake, doe that duty which they may if they will put off. But becauſe God knew that many will doe no more then neceſſity laieth vpon them, he hath made it a matter o
                        •
                     
                     
impoſſibility for women to beare and bring forth their children by another.
                  3. Anſw. If women would with cheerefulneſſe ſet themſelues to performe this duty, much of the ſuppoſed paine and paines would be leſſened.
                  4. Anſw. Though they put not forth their children to nurſe, they may for their eaſe entertaine a nurſe, ſo they giue ſucke themſelues.
               
               
                  6. Obiect. A mother that hath a trade, or that hath the care of an houſe, will neglect much buſineſſe by nurſing her childe: and her husband will ſaue more by giuing halfe a crowne a weeke to a nurſe, then if his wife gaue the childe ſucke.
                  
                     Anſw. No outward buſineſſe appertaining to a mother can be more acceptable to God then the nurſing of her childe: this is the moſt proper worke of her ſpeciall calling, therefore all other buſineſſes muſt giue place to this, and this muſt not be left for any other buſineſſe.
                  As for the husbands ſauing by putting the childe forth to nurſe, no gaine may giue a diſpenſation againſt a bounden duty.
               
               
                  7. Obiect. It will breake tender faire women, and make them looke old too ſoone.
                  1. Anſw. Gods ordinance muſt not giue place to womens 
                        ••
                     iceneſſe. Sarah was faire and old: The Virgin Mary was faire and young.
                  2. Anſw. Drying vp a womans milke will more breake her, then her childes ſucking of it: for it is a meanes both of better health, and alſo of greater ſtrength, as to beare children, ſo to giue them ſucke. Barren women and bearing women which put forth their children to ſucke, are moſt ſubiect to ſickneſſe and weakneſſe. The drawing forth of a womans milke by her childe is a meanes to get and preſerue a good ſtomach, which is a great preſeruatiue of good health.
               
               
                  8. Obiect. Husbands are diſturbed in the night time, and hindred of their ſleepe by their wiues giuing ſucke to their children.
                  1. Anſw. By this reaſon neither mothers nor other nurſes

which haue husbands, ſhould giue ſucke to children.
                  2. Anſw. Seeing children come from the loines of the father, as well as out of the wombe of the mother, they muſt be content to endure ſome diſturbance as well as their wiues, and ſo much the rather that they may the more pitty their wiues, and afford vnto them what helpe they can.
               
               
                  9. Obiect. Many husbands will not ſuffer their wiues to nurſe their children themſelues.
                  
                     Anſw. Becauſe it is a bounden duty, wiues muſt vſe all the meanes they can by themſelues or others to perſwade their husbands to let them performe it: they muſt take heede that they make not this a pretext to couer their owne ſloth, and lothneſſe to this duty: they may not make themſelues acceſſarie to their husbands fault by prouiding a nurſe, and ſending the childe away themſelues: if their husbands will ſtand vpon their authority, and be perſwaded by no meanes to the contrary, they muſt be meere patients in ſuffering the childe to be taken away.
               
               
                  10. Obiect. Many poore women maintaine their houſe by nurſing other folkes children.
                  
                     Anſw. If they were not that way imployed, they might take paines in ſome other thing. But the gaine of one may not make another neglect her duty.
               
               
                  11. Obiect. Some mothers cannot giue ſucke, they haue no milke: others cannot very well, in that they haue no nipples, or they haue ſore breaſts, or are ſickly, or it may be that they haue ſuch a diſeaſe, as the childe, if it ſhould ſucke of their milke, would draw to it ſelfe, and ſo the ſucking might proue very dangerous to the childe.
                  1. Anſw. God requireth no impoſſibilities: wherefore in propounding the duty I put in this caution (ſo far as they are able.)
                  
                  2. God requireth mercie, and not ſacrifice: if therefore in 
                        Hoſ. 6. 6. Matt. 9. 13. truth it be ſo that the mothers giuing ſucke to the childe will be dangerous to her ſelfe or to the childe, ſhe may and ought to forbeare: for giuing ſucke is but as ſacrifice to preuenting of danger, which is mercie. But women muſt take heed that they pretend not inability, and danger without iuſt cauſe. Some are themſelues the cauſe of wanting milke becauſe they

will not let it be drawne downe; or becauſe they will not vſe meanes (for meanes there are) to get and increaſe milke. There are meanes alſo to raiſe nipples where the breaſts are very flat. Refuſing to giue ſucke many times cauſeth ſome ſickiſhneſſe in a woman, and ſore breaſts, which might be preuented with the childes ſucking. If the foreneſſe be only in the nipples, a mother with enduring a little more paine may ſafely giue the childe ſucke. Many mothers haue giuen their children ſucke when bloud hath runne by the mouth of the childe by reaſon of ſore nipples, and yet both mother and childe done very well.
               
               
                  12. Obiect. Diuers children being nurſed by the mother haue died one after another.
                  
                     Anſw. Due and thorow ſearch muſt be made by thoſe that are skilfull: and if any cauſe be found in the mother, then the rule holdeth, Mercy and not ſacrifice: but if none can be found, the iſſue muſt be referred to Gods prouidence: and the vncertaine euen muſt not be an hinderance to a knowne dutie.
                  Thus the anſwering of the forenamed obiections maketh the point ſo much the more cleere.
               
            
            
               §. 14. Of the fathers dutie in incouraging his wife to nurſe her childe.
               
               The dutie which on a fathers part in this reſpect is required, is that he incourage his wife, and helpe her with all needfull things for the performance of this dutie. It is noted of Elka
                     
                        •
                     ah, that he ſuffered his wife to tarry at home while ſhe gaue ſucke to her ſonne, and would not force her to goe vp to the tabernacle as his other wife did, but gaue her all the eaſe and content he could, ſaying to her, Doe what ſeemeth thee good. 
                  1 Sam. 1. 23. And of Abraham it is noted, that after Sarah had done giuing the childe ſucke, he made a great feaſt, euen the day that 
                  
                     Gen. 21. 8. 
                  Iſaak was weined: one end whereof was to teſtifie his reioycing for Gods bleſſing on her motherly dutie ſo well performed.
            
            
               §. 15. Of the faults contrarie to a mothers nurſing her childe.
               
               Contrary to this dutie doe all ſuch mothers offend, as for

any by-reſpects when no neceſſity requireth put forth their children to be nurſed by others.

                     1. Some doe it for eaſe and quiet, becauſe they cannot endure to haue their ſleepe broken, or to heare their childe wrangle and crie.
                     2. Others doe it for niceneſſe, becauſe they are loth to open their breaſts, or to ſoile their cloathes.
                     3. Others vpon pride, conceiting that their beauty would be impaired, and they looke old too ſoone.
                     4. Others vpon gaine, becauſe they can haue a childe cheaper nurſed abroad then at home, where, at leaſt, they muſt hire a maid the more.
                     5. Others vpon pleaſure, that they might more freely ride abroad, and meet their Goſſips.
                     6. Others vpon other by-reſpects: all which doe argue much ſelfe-loue: little loue to their childe, and little reſpect to God. They can be counted but halfe-mothers: for nurſing a childe is as much as bearing and bringing it forth.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 16. Of a fathers fault in hindring his wiues nurſing of her child.
               
               To the forenamed fault of mothers doe all ſuch fathers make themſelues acceſſary, as forbid their wiues to nurſe their children, or are a griefe to them by their complaints of trouble, diſquiet and expence: or afford not things needfull, or doe not incourage them all they can to doe it. The mothers both paine and paines is the greateſt: it is in compariſon but a ſmall thing that fathers can endure therein. Their fault therefore muſt needs be the greater, if any way they be an occaſion of their childes putting forth to nurſe: which I haue the rather noted, becauſe husbands for the moſt part are the cauſe that their wiues nurſe not their owne children: and that partly by ſuffering, and partly by egging them on to put out their children. If husbands were willing that their wiues ſhould performe this dutie, and would perſwade and incourage them thereto, and afford them what helpes they could, where one mother now nurſeth her childe, twenty would doe it.
            
            
               §. 17. Of parents ioynt care about their childrens Baptiſme.
               
               There is a further dutie to be performed of parents to their

children euen in their infancy, and that is in regard of their ſpirituall good, which is this,
               
                  Parents ought to procure that their children be rightly baptized in due ſeaſon.
               
               This is indeed a common dutie appertaining to both parents, but moſt principally to the father, and that for two reaſons.
               1. The father is the chiefe and principall Gouernour, and hath the greateſt charge: accordingly he ought to haue the greateſt care euen in ſuch matters as are common to both.
               2. The mother at that time by reaſon of her trauell and deliuery is weake, and not in caſe to haue her head much troubled with many cares; much leſſe able her ſelfe to take order for ſuch weighty matters. Only the husband is to make knowne to his wife (if ſhe be not extraordinarily weake) what his purpoſe is concerning the place, time, manner, and other like circumſtances of baptizing the childe, and to aduiſe with her about the name, witneſſes, and ſuch like points. And if the husband be too backward and negligent, the wife ought ſo farre as ſhe is able to put him in minde of his dutie therein, and to ſtirre him vp by her ſelfe or ſome other to performe it.
            
            
               §. 18. Of the reaſons to moue parents to ſee their children baptized.

                     Obiect. The children which were borne in the wilderneſſe were not circumciſed.
                  
                     
                     Anſw. They had no abiding place in the wilderneſſe, but were euer and anon remouing: ſo as it would haue beene dangerous for the children to haue beene circumciſed: in that extraordinary caſe this rule tooke place, I will haue mercy and 
                     
                        Mat. 12. 7. 
                     not ſacrifice.
                  
                  3. The practiſe of Chriſtians, who beleeuing were themſelues 
                        Act. 16. 15, 33. and their whole houſhold baptized. Vnder whole houſhold children muſt needs be compriſed.
                  4. Chriſts embracing and bleſſing ſuch children as were 
                        Mat. 19. 13. brought to him: and rebuking thoſe that would haue kept them from him.
                  5. The promiſe of God made to them: for ſeeing God is ſo 
                        Gen. 17. 7. Act. 2. 39. gratious as to extend his promiſe to our children: our care muſt be to procure the ſeale which God offereth for the confirmation of that promiſe.
                  6. The right they haue to Gods Kingdome. Baptiſme is an 
                        Mat. 19. 14. euidence of that their right. It is parents duty to get them that euidence. If children haue iuſt title to any lands and reuenues, or to any earthly honours and dignities, parents will doe what they can to make that title ſure vnto them euen in their infancy: much more carefull ſhould they be to make that rich and glorious inheritance, which is in heauen reſerued for them, as ſure vnto them as they can: now no better meanes for the effecting of this then Baptiſme.
                  7. Their conception and birth in ſinne. Children drew contagion 
                        Pſal. 51. 5. from their parents: therefore great reaſon it is that their parents ſhould ſee them waſhed with the water of regeneration.
                  8. The comfort which from the performance of this dutie will ariſe to Chriſtian parents, yea and to the children alſo themſelues when they come to the age of vnderſtanding. When parents behold the couenant of God ſurely ſealed and confirmed to their children, they cannot (if at leaſt they beare any loue to their children) but much reioyce therein. And it muſt needs alſo much comfort the childe when (being of vnderſtanding) he ſhall know that from his infancy he hath caried the ſeale and pledge of his regeneration.

               §. 19. Of Parents procuring their children to be rightly baptized.
               
               There being ſuch forceable motiues to ſtirre vp parents to performe the dutie, (which motiues ſhew it to be a weightie dutie) I will further ſhew how this dutie ought to be performed.
               Two things in childrens baptiſme ought to be obſerued.

                     1. That it be rightly done.
                     2. That it be ſeaſonably done.
                  
               
               In the right performance thereof, ſome things are neceſſarie, and ſome expedient.
               
               Things of neceſſitie are theſe eſpecially:
               1. That the childe be baptized by a Miniſter of the word. 
                     Matth. 28. 19. Ioh. 3. 5.
               
               2. That it be baptized with the element of water: the only element ſanctified to this purpoſe.
               3. That the forme preſcribed by Chriſt (Matth. 28. 19.) be 
                     In Patrem, & in Filium, & in Spiritū Sanctū baptizamur, vt Trinitatis vnū appareat ſacramentum: ſed in vno nomine quod intelligitur Deu
                           •
                        . Hier. in Eph. 4. vſed, In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost: whereby the vnitie of the Godhead, and trinitie of Perſons is plainly ſet forth.
               4. That the proper rite be vſed of applying the water to the bodie of the childe, ſo as at leaſt the face of the childe may be ſprinkled therewith.
               Things of expediencie are,
               1. That the childe be baptized in a publike place, where Gods people ordinarily meet together, being ſet apart for the worſhip and ſeruice of God.
               2. That ſuch a time be choſen out, as an aſſembly of Saints may be there preſent.
               Theſe two circumſtances are the rather to be obſerued, becauſe Baptiſme is one of the ſolemne parts of Gods publike worſhip; a pledge of our incorporation into the bodie of Chriſt, and communion of his Saints, and therefore with the more ſolemnitie, (as a matter of great moment) before many witneſſes, with the aſſiſtance of the faithfull prayers of an aſſembly of Saints, to be performed.
            
            
               
               §. 20. Of Parents care to giue a fit name to their childe at his Baptiſme.
               
               A third matter of great expediencie about a childs baptiſme, is, that Parents be carefull in giuing a fit name.
               
               It belongeth to Parents to giue the name to their childe: for ſo Parents muſt giue the childs name. holy parents (whoſe patterne in Scripture is in this reſpect commended vnto vs) haue done from time to time: and for their warrant to doe it, it is worthy to be noted, that when God was pleaſed to appoint a name to a childe, he gaue in charge to the Parent ſo to name him, ſaying to him, 
                     Gen. 17. 19. Matth. 1. 21. Luk. 1. 13. 
                  Thou ſhalt call his name thus and thus.
               It is alſo euident, that the time of Baptiſme is the fitteſt time for giuing the name. 
                     Luk. 1. 59. & 2. 21. Vnder the Law, childrens names were giuen at their Circumciſion: and ſo vnder the Goſpell it hath in all ages beene vſed: and that for theſe reaſons.

                     1. That their names may be a teſtimonie of their baptiſme. Why the name is giuen at baptiſme.
                     
                     2. That ſo oft as they heare their names, they may be put in minde of their baptiſme.
                     3. That they might know how by name they are giuen to Chriſt to be his ſouldiers, and therefore there muſt be no ſtarting from him.
                     4. That they may alſo be aſſured, that being baptized with water and the ſpirit, by name they are regiſtred in heauen.
                  
               
               Now becauſe names are ſo ſolemnly giuen, and of ſo good vſe, Fit names to be giuen. moſt meet it is that fit names ſhould be giuen to children. And for proofe hereof, let the names which in Scripture are recorded to be giuen by God himſelfe, and by ſuch holy men and women as were guided by his ſpirit, be obſerued; and we ſhall finde them to be holy, ſober, and fit names.
               For direction to parents in this dutie, I will ſet downe ſome ſorts and kinds of names as be fit, and beſeeming Chriſtians.
               1. Names which haue ſome good ſignification: and among them ſuch as are warranted by the Scripture, as Iohn (the grace of God) Ionathan (the gift of God) Andrew (manly) Clement (meeke) Simeon (obedient) Hannah (gratious) Prudens (wiſe) and ſuch like: that thus their name may ſtirre them vp to labour after the vertue ſignified thereby.
               2. Names which haue in times before vs beene giuen to perſons

of good note, whoſe life is worthy our imitation, as Iſaak, Dauid, Peter, Marie, Elizabeth, and ſuch like: that the names may moue them to imitate thoſe worthies.
               3. Names of our owne anceſtors and predeceſſors, to preſerue a memorie of the familie: which appeareth to haue beene an ancient practiſe euen among Gods people, in that the friends would haue had Zachariahs ſonne named Zachariah; and when the 
                     Luk. 1. 59, &c.
                   mother had iuſt cauſe to name him Iohn, they anſwer, none of thy kindred is called by this name.
               
               4. Vſuall names of the country, which cuſtome hath made familiar, as Henry, Edward, Robert, William, and ſuch like among vs.
            
            
               §. 21. Of Parents care in bringing their children to be baptized in due ſeaſon.
               
               Though Chriſtians are not ſo ſtrictly tied to a ſet day, as the Iewes were to the eight day; yet from that ſtrict direction giuen to the Iewes, we may well gather, that it is not meet for Chriſtians to defer the baptizing of their children beyond eight dayes: for a young childe of that age may with more eaſe, and leſſe danger, be baptized, then circumciſed.
               The moſt ſeaſonable time I take to be the day whereon Gods Read the rubrick before the forme of adminiſtring Baptiſme in our Common Prayer booke. people vſe in the place where the childe is borne, publikely to aſſemble together to worſhip God next after the birth of the child, if at leaſt it fall not out within two or three dayes after, which is ſomewhat with the ſooneſt both for mother and childe.
               Whether we reſpect the honour of God (the riches of whoſe mercy is liuely ſet forth in the ſacrament of baptiſme) or the good of our childe (which in that ſacrament receiueth a pledge and ſeale of that rich mercy of God) Baptiſme is of great conſequence: and therefore the firſt ſeaſon of performing it to be taken. For parents by their diligence and due ſpeed therein, giue euidence both of their zeale to Gods glory, and alſo of their earneſt deſire of the childs ſpirituall good.
            
            
               §. 22. Of Parents faults in neglecting their childrens Baptiſme.
               
               Contrary to the forenamed dutie of Parents about well baptizing their children, are many aberrations, as
               1. The corrupt opinion of Anabaptiſts, who denie the lawfulneſſe of baptizing children. The arguments before noted are ſufficient to ſtop their mouthes.
               
                  
2. The practiſe of Separatiſts (comming too neere to Anabaptiſme) who excepting againſt the miniſterie and orders of our Church, doe what they can to keepe their children from that Sacrament. And to that end carry their wiues ready to be deliuered vnto a ſtrange place, where they are not knowne, and anon after they are deliuered, priuily conuey wife, childe, and all away, that ſo the Magiſtrate may not, againſt their will, cauſe their childe to be baptized: and hauing no miniſterie of their owne, nor meanes to conuey the childe ouer ſea, keepe it many yeeres vnbaptized. Where is the euidence of their faith in Gods promiſe, of their Chriſtianorum filij ſi baptiſma non receperint, ſcelus refertur ad eos qui dare noluerint: maxime eo tempore quo contradicere non pote rant qui accepturi erant. Hier. ad Laet. reſpect to Gods ordinance, and of their deſire of their childs ſpirituall good? Though it be a great wrong to children to be kept from baptiſme, yet the ſinne lieth on ſuch parents as procure not baptiſme for their children: eſpecially at that age when their children cannot gainſay it.
               3. The peruerſe opinion and practiſe of certaine ancient heretikes, who in ſtead of baptizing children with water, had them branded with an hot iron. They grounded their error on a falſe interpretation of this phraſe (he ſhall baptize with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.) 
                  
                     Seleuciani baptiſmum in aqua non accipiunt. Aug. de Haer. 59. Chemnit. harm. Euang. cap. 16.
               
               
                  Anſw. 1. They erre in taking this word (fire) literally and properly, which was meant myſtically and metaphorically.
               2. They erre in applying that to the outward action of a Miniſter, which was meant of the inward operation of Chriſt. By this their miſinterpretation they thwart the maine ſcope of him who firſt vſed that phraſe, which was to manifeſt the difference betwixt 
                     Sine myſterio Trinitatis quicquid in vnam aut alteram perſonam accipitur imperfectum eſt. Hier. in Ioel. 2. all other Miniſters and Chriſt Ieſus.
               4. The opinion and practiſe of thoſe, who vſe other formes of Baptiſme, beſides this, (In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost.) Their opinion and practiſe is grounded on certaine conciſe phraſes vſed by the Apoſtles: ſuch as theſe, Baptized in the name of Ieſus Chriſt: In the name of the Lord: In 
                  
                     Act. 2. 38. & 10. 48. & 19. 5. 
                  the name of the Lord Ieſus, &c.
               
                  Anſw. Thoſe phraſes rather ſet forth the very ſubſtance and inward matter of Baptiſme, then the forme thereof.
               5. Their opinion and practiſe, who care not by whom their children are baptized, whether heretiques, idolaters, laicks, or women: Little doe they regard the comfort of conſcience, and

ſtrength of faith, that ariſeth from this; that a lawfull Miniſter in Gods roome and name, as Gods ambaſſador, putteth the ſeale of God to his couenant.
               6. The practiſe of thoſe as (I know not vpon what niceneſſe or ſtate) muſt haue their children baptized at home in their priuate houſe. This manner of baptiſing taketh away much from the honour of that high ordinance, which ought to be done with all the ſeemly ſolemnitie that may be.
               7. Their practiſe who bring their childe to Church to be baptiſed, accompanied only with the Midwife, and three witneſſes. It were almoſt as good be baptiſed in a priuate houſe: for it is not the walls of the Church, but the aſſembly of Saints, that addeth to the honour of the Sacrament, and is moſt of all to be reſpected.
               8. Their practiſe who vpon ſtate, or for great witneſſes, or ſuch by-reſpects put off the baptiſing of their children longer then is meet, ſome, two or three weekes, ſome, two or three moneths, ſome longer: whereby they ſhew too light eſteeme of this Sacrament, in that they preferre meere complementall circumſtances before a matter of ſo great moment. God oft ſheweth his iuſt indignation againſt ſuch, in taking away their 
                     •
                  hildren vnbaptiſed before the time ſet downe by them for baptiſme be come.
               9. Their practiſe who care not what heatheniſh, idolatrous, Laſciua nomina paruulis baptizandis imponenda non ſant. Ioh. de Bur. 
                  
                     •
                  idiculous names they giue to their children. What reſpect

               §. 23. Of parents prouiding things needfull for the life and health of their children.
               
               Hitherto of the duties of parents reſpecting their childrens Infancie. Such as reſpect their childhood follow.
               The childhood of a childe is 
                     •
                  eckoned from the time that it 
                     •
                  eginneth to be of any diſcretion and vnderſtanding till it be 
                     •
                  t to be placed forth: euen ſo Many diſtinguiſh the whole courſe of a mans life into foure parts.

                     1. Childhood
                     2. Youth.
                     3. Man-age
                     4. Old-age.
                  
                  
long as ordinarily it liueth vnder the parents gouernment.
               The duties which parents for this time muſt performe to their children may be drawne to theſe two heads.

                     1. Care to bring them vp.
                     2. Care to place them forth.
                  
               
               For their well training vp, reſpect muſt be had both to their temporall and alſo to their ſpirituall good.
               Two things are required of parents, in regard of the temporall good of their children.

                     1. To nouriſh them well.
                     2. To nurture them well.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        Children muſt be well
                        
                           Fed.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Taught.
                        
                         
                     
                  
               
               Child-hood from his birth to 14. yeeres.
               Youth from 14 to 25.
               Man-age from 25. to 50.
               Old age from thence to his death.
               But for better diſtinguiſhing the duties which parents are to performe, I follow not ſo accurate a diuiſion, but rather diſtinguiſh the degrees of age according to the times wherein new duties are to be performed: and therefore I make a diſtinction betwixt infancie and childhood.
               
                  Feed them in diſcipline, ſaith the Apoſtle.
               Vnder nouriſhment are compriſed all needfull things for 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  health and life: which parents ought to prouide for their children, as
               1. Food, which Chriſt taketh for a ruled caſe. Whence he draweth his argument to ſhew that God will prouide for his children. What father (ſaith he) if his ſonne aske him bread would giue him a ſtone, &c. Mat. 7. 9, 10, 11.
               2. Apparell, for it is expreſly noted, that Iſrael made his ſon a coat, (Gen. 37. 3.)
               3. Recreation, which in young children eſpecially is needfull for their health. In that Zachary chap. 8. verſ. 5. told the Iewes, and that in way of bleſſing, that boyes and girles ſhould be playing in the ſtreets, he implieth that it is a lawfull and meet thing, which parents ſhould permit vnto their children. But yet the time, and meaſure, and kinde of recreation muſt be well ordered.
               4. Meanes for recouery of health when they are ſicke: for this end was it, that 1 King. 14. 2. 
                  Ieroboam ſent his wife to the Prophet,

in behalfe of his ſonne who was ſicke: that 
                     Ioh. 4. 47. the Ruler came to Chriſt for his ſonne alſo who was at point of death; and that many others came to him for their ſonnes and daughters being ill.
               Whatſoeuer other things are needfull, parents to their power 1 Tim. 5. 8. muſt prouide for their children: elſe the Apoſtle counteth them worſe then Infidels.
               Both equitie and neceſſitie require thus much of parents.
               
                  Equitie, in that children owe all their paines and ſeruice to their parents while they are vnder them, and are wholly at their command, and in that regard haue no meanes to prouide needfull things but by their parents helpe. Parents therefore in all right muſt herein be helpfull to them.
               
                  Neceſſitie, in that, if the life and health of children be not well prouided for, no dutie, no ſeruice can be expected at their hands.
            
            
               §. 24. Of parents too much niggardlineſſe, and careleſneſſe toward their children.
               
               There are two extremes contrary to the forenamed prouident 1. Contrary, Couetouſneſſe Non eſt boni parentis qucm procrearit, & eduxerit, cum non & veſtire & ornare. Cic. de Orat.

               §. 25. Of parents too much lauiſhneſſe and indulgency vpon their children.
               
               Others ſurpaſſe as much in the exceſſe, feeding them too 
                     ••
                  intily: attiring them too gariſhly: tending them too

cockeringly: and letting them ſpend too much time in ſport and play. Many and great are the miſchiefes that follow thereupon: as
               1. They who are in their childhood daintily fed, and too much pampered, beſides that for the moſt part they are moſt ſickly, they will in time grow ſo ſqueamiſh, and choice of meats, as their parents ſhall not know what to prouide for them, or when to giue it them: The full ſoule loatheth an hony 
                  
                     Pro. 27. 7. 
                  combe: yea if a ſtranger commeth to the table, where ſuch a childe ſitteth, he may ſoone obſerue that he hath beene too daintily fed. If at firſt children be fed with ordinary moderate diet, they will afterwards both be in better health and liking, and alſo more contentedly, and thankfully accept whatſoeuer ſhall be prouided for them. But exceſſe breedeth diſeaſes both in body and minde.
               2. Vanity in apparell doth alſo much corrupt young children: for there is in them euen from the cradle a naturall diſpoſition to outward brauery: now for parents to pranke them vp, what is it but to blow vp the fire of that vanity, and make it ariſe into ſuch a flame as in time may much ſcorch the parents themſelues, and vtterly conſume the children: and yet how vſuall a fault is this? how monſtrouſly doe many parents offend therein? what fooliſh faſhion is vſed of the greateſt ſwaggerers, and lighteſt ſtrumpets, which they will not bring their children vnto, and that when their children are not able to diſcerne betwixt ſtuffes or colours? what can this proclaime but parents pride and folly? Proud maids are many times the inſtruments of pranking vp children (eſpecially when they are little ones) more then is meet: but yet the blame lieth on parents for ſuffering it.
               3. Tending children too cockiſhly maketh them too long children, and too tender: and oft altereth a good conſtitution of body. Some are ſo ouer-much tender of their children, as if a childe neuer ſo little complaine, or refuſe the meate (though for daintineſſe or fulneſſe) the Phyſician muſt preſently be ſent for, and the Apothecary ſent vnto, and the childe with ſuppoſed and apiſh kindneſſe made much worſe.
               4. Too much ſport maketh them wilde, rude, vnfit to be

trained vp to any good calling, and ſpendeth their ſpirits, and waſteth their ſtrength too much. Yet many parents care not how much time their children ſpend in ſport, and how little in learning: they thinke it duls their children too much to be held to ſchoole, or to any learning: whereas indeed too much play infatuates them more, and learning would much ſharpen their wits.
            
            
               §. 26. Of well nurturing children.
               
               I referre good nurture in part to the temporall good of children, becauſe (as afterwards we ſhall heare in the particulars) it is an eſpeciall meanes of the outward temporall welfare of the childe euen in this world. Vnleſſe this be added to nouriſhing, wherein doe reaſonable men and women exceed vnreaſonable beaſts? the moſt cruell beaſts that be are very tender (as we heard before) towards their young ones, nouriſhing them, and prouiding all things needfull for them till they can ſhift for themſelues. But as God hath giuen to man a reaſonable ſoule, an vnderſtanding head, capacity, docility and aptneſſe to learne, ſo ought parents to make vſe of thoſe parts and gifts, leſt for want of vſing them, in time they be loſt: and ſo children proue little better then bruits. In this reſpect the prouerbe is true, better be vnfed then vntaught. Experience ſheweth that good education is better then a great portion. The Holy Ghoſt doth very much preſſe this point on parents, as we ſhall after heare in the particulars. For I will handle theſe three points.

                     1. The kindes of nurture.
                     2. The time when it is to be done.
                     3. The meanes of well doing it.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 27. Of parents neglect in nurturing children.
               
               Contrary to good nurture is too much liberty: which oft bringeth much woe, and vtter ruine vpon children: it is the greateſt enemy that can be of good education, and the nurſe of all vice Yet many parents care not to let their children liue as they liſt: all the care they take, is that they be fed and apparelled. This is a common fault both of rich, and of poore parents. The rich pretend that their children need no education, becauſe they haue enough to leaue them: not knowing

that education is an eſpeciall meanes to make them keepe and well vſe that enough. The poore pretend that they are not able to bring vp their children to any thing: not conſidering that the Lord by his prouidence hath ſo ordered the affaires of men, that as there are fit imployments for the greateſt, ſo alſo

                     2. In training them vp to a good calling.
                  
               
               Not only heathen men, and other moraliſts which were but meere naturall ciuill men, but alſo the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe hath preſcribed many rules of good manners, and much vrged and preſſed the ſame.
               1. The word

                  nurture mentioned by the Apoſtle in this text which we haue in hand, implieth as much: and the phraſe which Solomon vſeth, 
                     Pro. 22. 6. 
                  Traine vp a childe in the way he ſhould goe: that is, teach him how to order the courſe of his life.
               2. The many 
                     Leu. 19. 32. Pro. 25. 6. Luke 14. 8. precepts of reuerencing our ſuperiours, and carying our ſelues with reſpect one to another, are rules of good manners. Hereof there be very many in ſcripture.
               3. Thoſe rules are 
                     Gen. 23. 7. & 43. 33. Iob 32. 4, 6. commended by many examples of holy men recorded in Scripture.
               4. Such as haue 
                     Iob 30. 1, 12. Luke 14. 7. failed in the rules of good manners, and rudely carried themſelues, are reproued by the Holy Ghoſt.
               Neither is it without good reaſon that this point is ſo ſet forth. For
               1. Good manners are a very comely and ſeemely thing. But 1. Cor. 14. 40. it beſeemeth Chriſtians to doe all things decently. That decency is not only to be applied to the affaires of Gods Church, but alſo to the whole courſe of our life, in which reſpect we are commanded to walke 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  decently, that is, to order all our actions and the whole courſe of our life mannerly.
               2. They are a thing of good report, and that both to parents and children: Now we muſt doe all things that are of good report. 
                  
                     Phil. 4. 8.
               
               
                  
3. They worke a kinde of delight, and loue, and admiration, in thoſe that behold them, as is noted of the Queene of 1 King. 10. 5. Sheba when ſhe beheld the comely cariage of Solomons ſeruants: and of the Egyptians when they beheld the orderly 
                     Gen. 43. 33. ſitting of Ioſephs brethren.
               4. They are an outward ornament to piety and religion, and make it to be much more reſpected: in which reſpect S. Peter exhorteth beleeuing wiues well to order their conuerſation 1 Pet. 3. 1. before infidell husbands: and S. Paul exhorteth all ſorts of chriſtians to walke decently toward them that are without. 
                  1 Theſ. 4. 12.
               
               The Holy Ghoſt hauing thus vrged the point of good manners, we may not thinke it a meere complementall matter, and a needleſſe point, but a bounden duty.
            
            
               §. 29. Of the obiections againſt good manners.
               
               
                  1. Obiect. Religion and grace conſiſteth not in good manners: many that haue not a ſparke of Gods feare in their hearts, are able to carry themſelues in their outward behauiour very orderly and mannerly.
                  
                     Anſw. Though grace conſiſt not wholly in it, yet cannot grace well be without it: it is a great ornament and comelineſſe thereunto. And though mannerlineſſe may be ſeuered from a feare of God, yet Gods feare will not be ſeuered from it. Reſtraining grace may be in him who hath no renewing grace: but renewing grace preſuppoſeth reſtraining grace, euen as reaſon preſuppoſeth ſenſe, though ſenſe may be without reaſon. If ſuch as feare not God can carry themſelues comely and mannerly, what a ſhame is it for ſuch as ſeeme to feare God, not to doe ſo? ſhall not thoſe be a witneſſe againſt theſe?
                  
               
               
                  2. Obiect. Good manners are an hinderance to grace: they who are moſt diligent in teaching or practiſing the one, are commonly moſt negligent in the other.
                  
                     Anſw. This is a meere cauill. Sure I am that grace is no hinderance to good manners. If any make good manners an hinderance to grace, it is their fault.
               
               
                  3. Obiect. Good manners to grace are as mint, anniſe and cummin, to the great and weighty things of the law.
                  
                     Anſw. Grant it to be ſo: yet ſeeing both may ſtand together, why ſhould they be ſeuered? Chriſts rule is this, Theſe
                     
                     things ought ye to haue done, and not to leaue the other vndone.

                  4. Obiect. Many that make great ſhew of religion are very rude, and vnmannerly.
                  
                     Anſw. If there be onely a ſhew of religion in them, no maruell that they haue no manners. If ſome examples of ſuch as are truly religious and want good manners ſhould be ſhewed, their patterne is no preſident, much leſſe can it proue that to be no duty which Gods word hath ſet downe for a duty. Many that well performe ſome duties, much faile in other duties. Who almoſt followeth Gods word as he ſhould in euery thing?
               
            
            
               §. 30. Of parents ſuffering their children to be rudely brought vp.
               
               Contrary to parents care in teaching their children good manners, is diſſoluteneſſe: when parents ſuffer their children to grow vp in rudeneſſe, not caring how they carry themſelues at home or abroad, toward their parents, or toward others. Rude bringing vp maketh children to be of a crooked, peruerſe, ſtubborne, churliſh, furly, doggiſh diſpoſition; as on the other ſide, good nurture in this kinde breedeth in genuity, amiableneſſe, curteſie, and kindneſſe. If ſuch as are rudely brought vp be children of profeſſors of the true religion, they bring a ſtaine vpon their profeſſion: yea they diſhonour God, as if he were the author of vnmannerlineſſe and confuſion, againſt which the Holy Ghoſt proteſteth: and they make 1 Cor. 14. 33. themſelues and their children a ſcorne in the eie and mouth of profane perſons, who will be ready to point and ſay, Behold the children of profeſſors, how rudely they are brought vp, and ill taught: they haue not ſo much as good manners in them.
               
               For auoiding this blemiſh, Schoole-maſters and all ſuch as Admonition to Schoolemaſters. haue the charge of trayning vp young children, muſt bean helpe to parents in teaching children good manners.
            
            
               §. 31. Of parents training vp their children to ſome good calling.
               
               The ſecond branch of good nurture is a training vp of children vnto a good calling. This charge (traine vp a child in

                     ) directly condeth to this purpoſe. This duty hath from the beginning of the world beene performed

by parents, and their performance thereof commended by the holy Ghoſt. Adam brought vp his ſonnes to ſeuerall callings: one was a 
                     Gen. 4. 2. 
                  keeper of ſheepe, another a tiller of ground. The like is noted of 
                     Gen. 37. 12. 
                  Iaakobs ſonnes,

               Much good may from hence ariſe to parents themſelues, to their children, and to the people and places where ſuch children Benefits of a good calling. ſhall liue.
               1. A good calling is an eſpeciall meanes for children to maintaine themſelues and family, to releeue thoſe that ſtand in need, to eaſe their parents, and (if the need of parents require it) to releeue and maintaine them.
               2. It is that way wherein Gods Angels haue a charge to 
                     Pſal. 91. 11. keepe them while they walke in it.
               3. It is a meanes wherein and whereby they may be ſeruiceable to the common wealth where they liue.
               4. It is the beſt place wherein the generall duties of Chriſtianity may be moſt manifeſted, and beſt performed.
               5. It is the beſt ordinary meanes that can be preſcribed to keepe a childe from the vanities of youth, from immoderate purſuit of pleaſures, from vnlawfull games, from idleneſſe, from ill company, and ſuch like euils; which, as they are ſinnes in themſelues, ſo occaſions and prouocations to other moſt

                     Obiect. Many parents haue good lands to leaue to their children: what need is there of a calling to ſuch?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. Much land may ſoone be conſumed by ſuch as haue not skill well to vſe it.
                  2. Maintenance is but one end of a calling, and that not the chiefeſt and moſt principall.
                  3. More good may be done by skill in a calling, then by great ſtore of land.
                  4. We are borne for others as well as for our ſelues: it is not therefore ſufficient to ſay I haue enough to maintaine my ſelfe.
               
            
            
               
               §. 32. Of parents care in chooſing a fit calling for their children.
               
               The point in generall being declared to be a dutie, I will Directions for choiſe of callings. 1. Generall principles are to be taught. adde ſome directions for the better performing of it.
               1. Children are to be trained vp in thoſe things which are the ground worke of all callings, as reading, writing, and principles of learning. Whatſoeuer the particular calling be, theſe will be of great vſe to any one. Many that haue not beene taught them at firſt, would giue much for them afterwards. Parents at the firſt might teach their children thoſe things with much eaſe and ſmall charge, which afterwards cannot be 
                     Non ſunt contemnenda quaſi parua, ſine quibus magna conſtare non poſſunt. Hier. ad Laet. 2. The calling muſt be lawfull. ſo well learned, partly for want of leaſure, and partly becauſe the parts of thoſe who are growne in yeares are not ſo freſh and fit to learne, as in child-hood they were. Thoſe things are not to be contemned as ſmall, without which great things cannot ſtand.
               2. The calling whereunto children are trained vp muſt be lawfull, approued by Gods word, and not againſt the generall rules thereof: ſo may they keepe a good conſcience in the exerciſe thereof.
               3. The calling muſt be fit for the childe that is trained vp 3. The calling muſt be fit for the childes ability. to it. As there are diuers callings, ſo there are diuers abilities of ſundry children: ſome are fitteſt for callings of wit and learning: others for callings that require an able and ſtrong body. Wherein the wiſe diſpoſing prouidence of God is much commended: for thus are men much more vſefull one to another. Now for choiſe of a fit calling, a childs beſt ability wherein eſpecially it conſiſteth, whether in the exerciſe of minde or of body, is duly to be obſerued: and alſo his inclination, to what calling he is moſt diſpoſed.
               4. Among fit callings (for there may be many) that which 4. The beſt callings muſt be preferred. 1 Cor. 12. 31. is beſt and the moſt excellent is to be preferred. To this purpoſe not vnfitly may I apply that of the Apoſtle, ccuet earneſtly the beſt gifts.
               
               On this ground let parents be exhorted to traine vp ſuch Children to be trained vp to the miniſtery. children as they finde fit, to the great and weighty calling of the miniſtery: no calling wherein any may doe more good, and wherein (if they be able and faithfull Miniſters) they can

receiue more comfort and contentment. This exhortation is the more to be regarded, becauſe in compariſon of thoſe who are trained vp to other callings, ſo few are trained vp to this.
            
            
               § 33. Of parents faults contrary to their dutie of training their children vp to a calling.
               
               On the contrary, many parents much offend in not training vp their children to a calling as they ſhould. And the offence in this kinde is committed many waies. As
               1. When parents ſuffer their children to liue like little maſters at home, and paſſe ouer all their youth in idleneſſe. Thus they proue very drones, and caterpillars in the common wealth: if they haue a patrimony, they ſoone waſte it: if they haue none, they oft proue either theeues or beggars: they are fit for all companies: the readieſt prey for the deuill that can be: for they are like the houſe empty, ſwept and garniſhed, which 
                     Mat. 12. 44. when the euill ſpirit eſpieth, he preſently entereth into it with ſeuen other ſpirits worſe then himſelfe.
               The wiſe law-maker among the heathen is ſaid to order Solon legibus cauiſſe legitur, vt filius, quem parentes nullam artem docuiſſent, non cogeretur illos alere ſenio confectos, aut ad inopiam redactos. Eraſ. Inſtit. Matrim. that the childe which by his parents had beene taught no Art, ſhould not be forced to nouriſh them though they were old or poore. This I all eage not to iuſtifie the law (for it is againſt the Chriſtian rule of ouercomming euill with goodneſſe) but to ſhew how the very heathen iudged the neglect of this dutie a great fault in parents.
               2. When parents neglect to teach their children in their child-hood the generall and common grounds of all callings: ſome vpon niggardlineſſe; others vpon careleſneſſe. Thus poore men make their children vnfit for many meanes, whereby they might well maintaine themſelues: and rich men make theirs vnfit for magiſtracy, and for good ſociety. Yea poore and rich are thus nouſled vp the more in ignorance, and made the more vnfit to profit by the preaching of the word, and other meanes of ſpirituall edification.
               3. When parents bring vp their children in vnwarrantable and vnlawfull callings, as to be of popiſh and idolatrous orders; to attend vpon papiſts; to be ſtage-plaiers, keepers of dice-houſes, &c. Some (which is horrible to thinke of) traine

vp their daughters to be common ſtrumpets: and ſome 
                     Phoenices Veneri donum dabant de proſtitatione filiarum, antequam iungerent eas viris. Aug de Ciu. D. l. 4 c. 10. vide Lud. Uiu. in hunc loc. Recte dicuntur parentes filios daemoniorum ſacrilegijs obligare conantes, ſpir taliter homicidae. Aug. Epiſt. 23. (which is yet more horrible) traine vp their children to be ſorcerers and witches. How can they in theſe keepe a good conſcience, when the very workes of their calling are ſinne? Is not this to thruſt them headlong into hell? They who thus binde their children to the deuils ſacrileges are ſpirituall murtherers of them.
               4. When parents haue no reſpect at all to the fitneſſe of the calling: as when they traine vp children of able bodies, but dull and ſlow capacity, of a ſtuttering tongue and other like imperfections, to learning, wherein they proue very dunces, and loſe all their time, or are not able to make vſe of the learning which they haue: or when they traine vp children which haue a great inclination to learning, and are very fit thereunto, in ſome other trade, which, after many yeeres ſpeut therein, they are forced to leaue.
               5. When parents only ſeeke after the moſt gainfull trade, and neuer thinke to educate their children moſt to the honour of God. How can ſuch expect Gods bleſſing vpon the meanes vſed for their childrens good? Hence is it that among Papiſts ſo many are trained vp to Eccleſiaſticall orders and functions: and ſo few among Proteſtants. For there is very great maintenance and reuenues for ſuch among Papiſts: but little in compariſon among Proteſtants:

               §. 34. Of parents teaching their children piety.
               
               The ſpirituall good of children, and that in their childhood, is to be procured by parents as well as their temporall. Wherefore Parents muſt traine vp their children in true piety. This is expreſly commanded in my text vnder this phraſe admonition of the Lord. Vnder the law God did both ſimply 
                     Deut. 4. 9. & 6. 7 & 11. 19. Pſal. 78. 5, 6. command it, and that very often, and alſo ordained diuers outward 
                     Exo. 12 26. & 13. 14. rites, and cauſed many viſible and extraordinary 
                     Ioſ 4. 6, 7, 21. monuments to be ſet vp, that thereby children might be occaſioned to aske of their parents the myſterie of them, and that parents from that inquirie of their children might take occaſion to 
                     Deul. 6. 20. teach them the ordinances of the Lord.
               
                  
This expreſſe charge of the Lord is further commended by that practiſe which holy parents from time to time haue yeelded thereunto: inſtance the examples of 
                     Gen. 18. 19. 
                  Abraham,

                  Lois and Eunice, with many others.
               1. Pietie is the beſt thing that a parent can teach his childe: for as reaſon maketh a man differ from a beaſt; and as learning and ciuilitie maketh a wiſe and ſober man differ from ſauages and ſwaggerers; ſo pietie maketh a ſound Chriſtian much more to differ from the moſt ciuill and well ordered naturall man that can be. Learning, ciuilitie, calling, portion, are all nothing without pietie. Now it is an eſpeciall point of wiſdome, to ſeeke the beſt good that we can, as for our ſelues, ſo alſo for our children: yea this is an euident ſigne of a parents true loue of his childe.
               2. There is a neceſſitie that children be taught pietie, becauſe 2. Neceſſitie of pietie. Fiunt non naſcuntur Chriſtiani. Hier. ad Laet.
                   they are not borne but made Chriſtians: by nature they are vtterly deſtitute of all pietie: for by nature euery imagination of the thoughts of mans heart is only euill continually (Gen. 6. 5.) and in that reſpect man is borne like the wilde aſſe colt (Iob 11. 12.) ſo as a man were better be vnborne then not taught pietie.
               3. The charge and office of parents bindeth them to teach their 3. Charge of parents. children pietie: for they are by God made watchmen ouer their children: if therefore their children liue and die in impietie through their parents negligence, their bloud ſhall be required at their parents hands: inſtance the example of 1 Sam. 3. 13.

                     Anſw. 1. God hath giuen an expreſſe charge hereof to parents, as we heard before.
                  2. In the familie a parent is all in all ouer his childe: a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet. Therefore that which a Miniſter is to doe for matter of inſtruction in the Church, a parent muſt do at home.
                  3 Children haue need of daily inſtruction: the parents paines in this kinde muſt be added to the Miniſters: and both are little enough.
                  4. Parents hauing more familiaritie with their children then Miniſters, muſt needs better know their capacitie, and their diſpoſition: and ſo may better know after what manner to inſtruct them: whether to giue them milke or ſtrong meat, whether to deale mildly or roughly with them.
                  
                     
5. Inſtructions from parents are commonly more kindly accepted then from others: and children will the better relliſh them, when they come from their parents. They ſay that a plant will beſt grow in the ſoile out of which it firſt ſprung: ſo inſtructions comming from thoſe who both brought vs forth, and firſt brought vs vp, are like to doe moſt good.
                  6. There is no ſuch meanes to breed loue in a childs heart, as to be an inſtrument of bringing piety thereinto. Now who ſhould more ſeeke the true loue of a childe then a parent? In this reſpect a parent is more bound to this dutie then a Miniſter.
                  7. It is impoſſible, that a Miniſter, who, it may be, hath many hundred children vnder his charge, ſhould well inſtruct them all: It is therefore requiſite, that each parent looke to his owne children.
                  As theſe diſtinct anſwers ſatisfie the obiection, ſo they ſerue as ſo many more reaſons to inforce the dutie: wherefore to proceed in adding other reaſons,
                  4. Great equitie there is that parents teach their children piety, 4. Equitie. becauſe they 
                        Pſal. 51. 5. conceiued and brought them forth in iniquitie. If they ſuffer them to lie and die in that corrupt eſtate, they are more cruell then the Oſtrich and Dragon.
                  5. Children are moſt properly Gods: 
                        Ezec. 16. 20, 21. 
                     borne to God: he is the 5. Gods children. moſt proper parent of them: in compariſon of God, fathers and mothers of the fleſh are but nurſes. They muſt therefore nurture them in the admonition of the Lord.
                  
                  6. Pietie is that, which of all other things, will make the childe 6. Cauſe of obedience. moſt obedient, and gratefull to his parents: for thus there is a double bond to binde him: 1. his birth. 2. his new birth: eſpecially when the cauſe of the one hath beene alſo the cauſe of the other.
                  7. Nothing can more ſettle the heart of a wiſe parent on his 7. Comfort of parents on their deathbed. death-bed concerning his children, then aſſurance that pietie is planted in them: for then may he with ſtronger confidence commend them to Gods prouidence, and with greater aſſurance expect his bleſſing vpon them after he is dead.
                  8. Parents, by teaching their children pietie, are an eſpeciall 8. Propagation of pietie. meanes of propagating true religion from age to age, and from generation to generation. No better meanes can be thought of.

For if all parents were carefull of their dutie in this kinde, as there is a ſucceſſion of children, and thereby a preſeruation of mankinde, ſo there would be a ſucceſſion of thoſe that feare God, and thereby a preſeruation of true religion. My children that are taught by me, may be fathers of children, and ſo teach that to their children, which they haue learned of me: yea after them may grandchildren proue fathers of other children, and they teach their children the ſame, and ſo from age to age others after them. This is the meanes on our part: and in our time we muſt doe our part: and for thoſe who come after vs, leaue the iſſue to God.
                  Not only the great benefit of this point, but alſo the too much neglect thereof, in moſt families, hath moued me the longer to inſiſt on it, and the more forcibly to preſſe it. For the better performing thereof, I will adde ſome directions.
               
            
            
               §. 35. Of directing parents how to teach their children true pietie.
               
               1. Whatſoeuer principle of pietie, parents doe teach their children, 1. Principles of pietie to be all taken out of Gods word. they muſt be ſure that it be grounded on Gods word: thus much this phraſe (admonition of the Lord) implieth.
               Thus ſhall parents be ſure to feed them with good wholeſome ſpirituall food, ſuch as ſhall make to their ſpirituall nouriſhment, and eternall life. In this reſpect principles of religion grounded on Gods word are called ſound, or wholſome, or healthfull words: 
                  2 Tim. 1. 13. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . and that both in regard of their matter and ſubſtance, and alſo in regard of their effect; they cauſe and preſerue good, ſound, ſpirituall health. We know that naturall men haue a care to giue their children ſuch food as is wholſome for their bodie: (for will a father 
                  
                     Mat. 7. 9, 10, 11. 
                  that is euill, giue his childe a ſtone, or a ſerpent, and not that which is good?) Conſcience muſt moue religious parents, to haue the like care of the ſoules of their children, as nature teacheth all parents to haue of their bodies. If parents be carefull to draw thoſe principles, wherein they inſtruct their children, out of Gods word, they ſhall be ſure not to poyſon their ſoules with any error, hereſie, ſuperſtition, or idolatrie.
               2. When children begin to read, let them read the holy Scripture: 2. Let children at firſt read the Scripture. ſo was Timothie trained vp from a childe (2 Tim. 3. 15.) Thus will children ſucke in religion with learning: for there is a ſecret vertue lurking in the holy Scripture (which is Gods owne

word) more then in any bookes of men: ſo as through Gods 
                     Sacrae Scripturae nominibus vtantur, & loco fabularum ſelectae illis hiſtoriae narrentur, & ſententijs prouerbialibus ex Solomone inſtituantur. Baſil. Aſcet. c. 15. 3 Catechiſe children daily. Deut. 6. 7. bleſſing there may by this meanes be an inward worke of grace in children euen in their young yeeres. Beſides, no bookes are more eaſie then many parts of Scripture; and no hiſtories more admirable and delightfull, then the hiſtories of the Scripture. It is the aduice of an ancient Father, that young children be made acquainted with the words and names of holy Scripture: and that, in ſtead of tales and fables, choice hiſtories of the Bible be made knowne to them: and that they be inſtructed in the Prouerbs of Solomon.
               
               3. Let children be catechiſed conſtantly from day to day: rehearſe them continually vnto thy children, ſaith the Law. That which is daily done, is in Scripture ſaid to be done continually: as the ſacrifice which was daily offered was called a continuall offering. Here let this caueat be noted, that in giuing this ſpirituall food, parents deale with their children, as skilfull nurſes and mothers doe in feeding infants: they will not at once cram more into their mouthes, then their ſtomach is able to digeſt, but they will rather oft feed them with a little: ſo it is not meet, that parents be too tedious; that will but dull a childs vnderſtanding, and breed weariſomneſſe, and make it loath to be againe inſtructed: but precept vpon precept, precept vpon precept, line vpon line, line vpon line, 
                  
                     Iſa. 28. 10. 
                  here a little, and there a little. Thus ſhall they learne with caſe and delight: and this being oft performed, in time a great meaſure of knowledge will be gained thereby. If a veſſell haue a little mouth, we vſe not to fill it by powring whole paile-fuls vpon it, for ſo all may be ſpilt, and it receiue little or nothing: but we let the liquor fall in by little and little, according to the capacitie of the mouth; ſo is nothing loſt, and the veſſell filled the ſooner. Thus are children to be dealt withall.
               4. To the ſet times of catechizing children, let other occaſions 4. Take all occaſions from ſenſible things to make a ſpirituall vſe. of teaching them pietie be added: as at table, by reſembling the ſpirituall food of their ſoules, to that corporall food, whereby their bodies are nouriſhed: when they are walking abroad, by ſhewing them the ſtarres, how they remaine ſtedfaſt in their courſe; the trees, how they bring forth fruit in their ſeaſon; how all things are for the vſe and benefit of man, and thereupon make ſpirituall vſes: note the direction which for this purpoſe the Law giueth to parents, Thou ſhall talke to thy children of my words, 
                  
                     Deut. 6. 7.
                  
                  when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt downe, and when thou riſeſt vp.
               
               5. Let parents open to their children the myſteries of thoſe 5. Open the myſteries of the rites of the Church. Exo. 12. 26. & 13. 14. outward rites which God hath ordained in his Church, as of Preaching, Baptiſing children, adminiſtring the Lords Supper, ceaſing from worke on the Lords day, with the like. This was expreſly commanded vnder the law. Viſible rites are great helpes to the weake vnderſtanding of children, when they are plainly opened and applied: yea they are alſo eſpeciall meanes of keeping in memory the myſteries contained vnder them: as courſe threds or wiars are meanes to preſerue pearles put vpon them. So oft as they ſee the rites they will be put in minde of the myſteries implied vnder them.
               6. To this may be referred a declaration of ſuch great and 6. Let Gods great workes be declared. admirable workes as God in former times hath done for his Church: eſpecially ſuch workes as haue beene done in their time: and if any memorials be remaining of them, make them knowne to children. This direction was alſo giuen vnder 
                     Joſ. 4. 6, 21. the law, concerning the monuments which were ſet vp of the great deliuerances that God gaue to his people. In particular when the day of the gunpowder-treaſon is ſolemnized, parents ought to teach their children the occaſion of ſolemni

                  Ioſua) will ſerue the Lord: he ſetteth himſelfe firſt as a guide to the reſt. 
                     Pſal. 101. 2. Nihil in te & in Patre ſuo videat, quod ſi fecerit peccet. Mementote vos parentes virginis, magis eam exemplis doceri poſſe, quàm voce. Hier. ad Laet.
                   
                  I will walke in mine houſe with a perfect heart, ſaith Dauid, whereby he would make himſelfe an example, as to others of his family, ſo to his children. Example is a reall inſtruction, and addeth a ſharpe edge to admonition. Much more ſhall a religious parent doe by practiſe then by precept. For children are much inclined to follow their parents: let them goe before, children will ſoone follow after. Practiſe is an euident proofe of the neceſſitie of the precept deliuered.
            
            
               §. 36. Of Parents faults contrary to their dutie of teaching their children piety.
               
               Many are the aberrations contrary to the forenamed care of teaching pietie. For
               1. Moſt parents care only for the temporall and ciuill good of their children: ſo their children may be well fed and clothed, and brought vp in ſome profitable calling, whereby they may well maintaine themſelues in this world, little thought is 
                     Iob non tantum pro corpore filiorum ſollicitus erat, ſed plus de anima cogitabat. Orig. in Iob. lib. 1. had, or care taken for their ſpirituall life in this world, or eternall life in the world to come. Wherein are theſe parents better then heathen? Iob was otherwiſe minded: he was more carefull for their ſoules then for their bodies.
               2. Many are ſo farre from teaching piety, as they teach their children profaneneſſe, pride, riot, lying, deceit, and ſuch like principles of the deuill. It had beene better for ſuch children to haue liued among wilde beaſts, then vnder ſuch parents. As the children hereby are thruſt headlong to hell, ſo their blood ſhall be required of their parents.
               3. Others thinke it enough that their children be taught a religion, but what religion it skilleth not. Such are they as hauing rich kindred but popiſh, commend their children to the education of ſuch kindred, in hope of ſome temporall benefit, that their children may reape from them. If they were as careleſſe of their childrens bodies, they would be accounted little better then murtherers: and is not the ſoule more pretious then the body?
               
                  
4. So farre are many from catechiſing their children and that daily, as they teach them not ſo much as the Lords praier, the Beleefe, and the ten Commandements. Wherein Papiſts ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt them, that are very diligent in teaching their children, Pater noſter, Aue Maria, and ſuch like Latine principles, as the children cannot poſſibly vnderſtand.
               5. Few vſe the forenamed outward helpes, as the holy rites appointed of God, the great and glorious workes of God, his extraordinary workes of mercy or iudgement, to inſtruct their children thereby. As they themſelues care not to take notice of any ſuch thing, ſo they care not whether their children doe it or no.
               6. So much doe ſome preferre a little pelfe before the true Alexander & in moribus, & in inceſſu l. eonidis paedagogi ſui non potuit carere vitijs, quibus adbuc paruulus fuit infectus. Hier. ad Laet. good of their children, as they care not to what ſchoolemaſter they put their children, be he profane, or popiſh, or vnlearned, eſpecially if he be a kinſman, or one of their friends. Few will ſo doe in caſe of their health or outward eſtate: but will rather get the beſt Phyſitian, or the beſt Lawyer that they can. Children oft learne ſuch euill qualities of their ſchoolemaſters as they can neuer ſhake off againe.
               7. Many proue very bad patternes to their children, and giue very ill example by profanenſſe, riotouſneſſe, ſwearing, drinking, playing at vnlawfull games, &c. Theſe parents as they brought forth their children in ſinne, ſo they lead them on forward to hell. Their euill example is not only an hinderance to the good inſtruction of others, but alſo maketh all their owne counſells (if at any time they doe giue any good counſell) to be in vaine: for the left hand of euill example Parentes non educant filios in eruditione domini quia ſolliciti non ſunt pro ſalute vel perditione eorum. Orig. loc. citat. ſoone pulleth downe more then the right hand of inſtruction can build againe.
               To conclude, thoſe parents whoſe children are not brought vp in the inſtruction of the Lord, ſhew plainly that they regard neither the ſaluation or damnation of their ſoules.

                  1. Anſw. Though children haue not ſo deepe an apprehenſion while they are young, as they haue when they come to riper yeares, yet ſo ſoone as they are capable of inſtruction, they doe much better conceiue what is taught them, then vnreaſonable creatures can doe.
                  2. Though that were granted, yet it would not thereupon follow, that it is better not to be taught while they are young. For, firſt it is better that they ſhould be framed and ſquared to a good courſe, before they can diſcerne betwixt good and euill,

               §. 38. Of mothers peculiar care in nurturing young children.
               
               By the way let mothers eſpecially note this point of timely nurture, as a point in peculiar appertaining to them. The Compare 2 Tim. 1. 5. with 3. 15. grandmother Lois, and mother Eunice, firſt taught Timothy, 
                  
                     Prou. 31. 1. 
                  Bathſheba taught Salomon when he was young. Oft doth Salomon warne children 
                     & 1. 8. & 6. 20. not to forſake their mothers teaching.
               
               Whereby he implieth that mothers ſhould teach their children eſpecially while they are young: which duty ſo belongeth to a mother, as 
                     Prou. 29. 15. 
                  Salomon laieth the blame, and ſhame of the neglect thereof vpon her: on the other ſide the honour of well nurturing children redoundeth eſpecially to the mother. To this purpoſe is it, that the 1 King. 15. 2, 10. particular names of the mothers of the kings are recorded in Scripture: intimating thereby that mothers were a maine cauſe of the piety, or impiety of ſuch children. Salomon and Abſolom had both one father, but diuers mothers. May we not well thinke that Salomons mothers care to inſtruct him was an eſpeciall meanes of his piety: and that Abſoloms mothers neglect of this duty, was ſome cauſe of his impiety? It is expreſly noted of Ahaziahs mother, that ſhe was his counſeller to doe wickedly, which made him ſo wicked 2 Chro. 22. 3. as he was. Home-experience confirmeth as much: for if father and mother be of diuers religions, moſt of the children will follow the mother. For while children are young, their mother is moſt in their ſight: ſhe feedeth, ſhe apparelleth them, ſhe tendeth them when they are not well, (when the Shunemites childe being ill, ſaid to his father, my head, my head, he ſaid to his ſeruant, carrie him to his mother.) Her precepts therefore 2 King. 4. 19. and practiſe in that reſpect are beſt heeded by the children, and ſhe hath the beſt opportunity to perſwade them to what ſhe liketh beſt: ſo as what they learne in their younger yeares, commonly they learne of their mothers: and that which then they learne, for the moſt part ſticketh moſt cloſe vnto them, and is longeſt retained by them, as was noted §. 37. before.
               I haue not thus in particular preſſed this point vpon mothers, as if I exempted fathers from all care of nurturing their children in the beginning: for in my text the Apoſtle named Fathers: and Salomon ſaith, that his father taught him eue
                        •
                      while he was tender: and Dauid felt the ſmart of neglecting hi
                     •
                  
                  
other children. It is therefore (as hath before beene proued) a ioynt duty belonging to both. Fathers therefore muſt doe their beſt endeuour, and ſee that mothers doe theirs alſo, becauſe he is a gouernour ouer child, mother, and all.
            
            
               §. 39. Of letting ſlip the beſt time for nurture.
               
               Contrary is the negligence of moſt parents, who let the beſt yeares wherein their children are moſt docible paſſe ouer in wantonneſſe, vanity, and folly: and ſo loſe that which can neuer be recouered againe, moſt precious time. Hence is it that when they goe about to reclaime their children, they finde them exceedingly peruerſe and head-ſtrong: much like to a ſtrong bigge arme of a tree, which if a man goe about to ſtraiten, he cannot eaſily make it bow: and though it bow, yet will it not continue to ſtand as he would haue it: nay it may be that it will rather breake then bow much. Such a branch was Adoniah. It is apparent that in his childhood he was not well nurtured, for his father would not diſpleaſe him from his childhood. 
                  1 King. 1. 6.
               
               The fathers putting off this duty to the mother, and the mothers putting it off to the father, is a great cauſe of the neglect thereof. Were both of them perſwaded that it belonged to them both, and in that reſpect would to their power be helpfull each to other, children would much better be inſtructed.
            
            
               §. 40. Of parents continuing to nurture their children.
               
               As parents muſt begin betimes to nurture their children, ſo they muſt hold on therein, as long as they retaine any gouernment ouer them: yea ſo long as they remaine to be parents vnto them. Some difference there may be in the manner of performing this duty: for children are to be vſed as children: and they who are growne in yeares, and of riper vnderſtanding, accordingly to be dealt withall: yet ſtill muſt parents haue a care of their well doing. The word vſed in my text and tranſlated Children, is a generall word which in Scripture and other 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . writers is vſed to ſet forth all ſort of children, of what ſexe, of what age, of what degree ſoeuer they be. In handling the duty of children we Treat. 5. §. 62. ſhewed, that children owed a ſubiection to parents ſo long as they liued together: wherefore by the rule of relation, ſo long alſo an authority remaineth in parents ouer

their children, and accordingly they ought to haue a fatherly care for their good. On this ground Eli did well in admoniſhing 1 Sam. 2. 25. Iob 1. 5. Hoc faciebat ille beatus vir, non ſemel, aut ſecundo, neque vno anno, aut duobus, ſed ſic faciebat Iob omnibus diebus vitae eorum. Orig. in Iob lib. 1. his children after they were maried: his fault was that he went not farre enough in doing his duty: ſomewhat he did, but not all that he ſhould and might haue done. Iob is commended for the care he had ouer his children when they were growne in yeares: for day by day he ſent for them and ſanctified them: and that after they had ſeuerall houſes of their owne, and dwelt apart: and this all their daies.
               For the performance of that which is now vrged, parents muſt ſo carrie themſelues from time to time towards their children, as they euer keepe the reines in their owne hands, and Direction. retaine a power to curbe their children as they ſee occaſion. They may, as their children grow vp in yeares, ſlaken the reines more and more, but neuer let them cleane goe, and caſt them looſe on their childrens necke.
            
            
               §. 41. Of parents folly in letting goe all their power ouer their children.
               
               Contrary is their folly who put themſelues in their childrens power, and let goe all their authority ouer them. Many Aegrè reprendas quod ſinis conſueſcere. Hier. ad Laet. parents that haue thus done, hauing by wofull experience found the miſchiefe and inconuenience that hath followed thereupon, haue much repented their folly, and vſed meanes of redreſſe, but all too late. For a miſchiefe is much more eaſily preuented then redreſſed. All the power that Dauid had could not hold in Abſolom after he was permitted to haue 2 Sam. 15. 1. horſes, and chariots, and men at his command. If Dauid, as he begun, had continued to keepe him within a compaſſe, and ſtill held him vnder, all the treaſonable plots which he put in execution, might eaſily haue beene preuented. Our times afford too many examples of parents folly in this kinde, and of the miſchiefes following thereupon.
               Of Time of nurture thus farre. The meanes thereof follow.
            
            
               §. 42. Of adding admonition to inſtruction.
               
               The meanes of helping forward the good worke of nurture III. The means of nurture. are eſpecially two.

                     1. Frequent admonition.
                     2. Due correction.
                  
               
               
                  
Both of them are implied in this text: one in the word tranſlated admonition, which (according to the notation of the 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . See Treat. 1. §. 120. Greeke word) is a putting of a thing into the mind, an vrging and preſſing of it: the other in the word tranſlated nurture. 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . See Treat. 1. §. 119.
               
               Now both theſe are to be ioyned together, as being very helpfull each to other. For admonition without correction is like to proue but meere vanity: and correction without admonition will be too much auſterity.
               The dutie which the firſt of theſe ſetteth forth, is this,
               
                  Parents muſt oft whet inſtruction vpon their children: they 
                     Annuncia, praecipe, impera, ſuade eis, &c. Aug. de ſalut. docum. cap. 29. may not thinke it enough to tell their children what they ought to doe, but to inſtruction they muſt adde admonition: and, as it were, beat into their childrens heads the leſſons which they teach them: that ſo they may make a deeper impreſſion in their hearts. Thus ſhall their inſtructions be like the words of the wiſe which are as nailes faſtened, or faſt knocked 
                     Eccl. 12. 11. in: they remain firme where they are once faſtened, and cannot eaſily be pluckt out: for as many blowes doe knocke a naile vp to the head (as we ſpeake) ſo many admonitions doe ſettle good inſtructions in a childes heart, and cauſe that the heart be eſtabliſhed in that which is taught, 
                     Heb. 13. 9. which is a thing to be laboured after. The generall exhortation of being 2 Tim. 4. 2. 
                  inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon may be applied to this purpoſe: but more pertinently that 
                     Deut. 6. 7. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               To this purpoſe is it that Solomon vſeth to double his inſtructions, and vrge them againe and againe, as 
                     Pro. 1. 8. 
                  heare the inſtruction, forſake not the law: 
                  
                     & 2. 1, 2. Direction.
                   
                  receiue my words, hide my commandements within thee: incline thine eares, apply thy heart, &c. yea of the repeateth the very ſame precepts.
               The apprehenſion of children is fickle, and their memory weake: if they be but once, or ſeldome, or ſleightly inſtructed, that which is taught will ſoone ſlip away, and doe little or no good.
               For the better performing of this dutie, parents muſt thinke of the beſt meanes they can to faſten their inſtructions vpon their children: and obſerue their inclination and diſpoſition, and ſee with what they are moſt moued. Conſtant exhortations,

and powerfull perſwaſions are compriſed vnder admonition, which in their kindes, as occaſion requireth, are to be vſed.
            
            
               §. 43. Of parents weariſomneſſe in inſtructing their children.
               
               Contrary is the practiſe of thoſe parents who ſoone waxe weary in inſtructing their children. The Apoſtle laieth it downe as a generall caueat in good duties that we wax not 
                  
                     Gal. 6. 9. 
                  weary: if in no good thing we muſt wax weary, ſhall parents wax weary in doing good to their children? Yet how many be there that hauing once taught their children, thinke they haue done dutie enough in that kinde: if their children will take it, they may. They are loth to take too much paines in often vrging the points which they haue taught them.
               Thus that teaching vaniſheth away: and ſo it falleth out, as we ſay in the prouerbe, as good not at all as neuer the better. This is one point wherein old Eli failed: for he gaue very good inſtruction to his children: but becauſe he there ſtaied, neither was that accepted of God as a ſufficient diſcharge of his duty, nor were his children any whit bettered thereby. If this were a fault in him notwithſtanding his children were come to yeares of diſcretion, and to ripeneſſe of vnderſtanding, how much greater is the fault in thoſe whoſe children are but young?
               
                  
                     Obiect. If a childe take not inſtruction at firſt, he is but of an vntoward and peruerſe diſpoſition: all the paines that can be taken will be loſt.
                  
                     Anſw. It may be childiſhneſſe rather then peruerſneſſe, or ſome imperfection, rather then obſtinacy. Conſidering the neceſſity of good nurture, no paines may be thought too much. There is more peruerſeneſſe, and vntowardneſſe i
                        •
                      ſuch parents as wax weary in doing this dutie, then in ſuch children as at firſt are not wrought vpon: for this is a means ordained of God to cure this vntowardneſſe.
               
            
            
               §. 44. Of parents reprouing their children.
               
               The other meanes of helping nurture is correction.
               
                  
                     
                        Which is of two ſorts;
                        Verball,
                        by
                        Words.
                     
                     
                        Reall,
                         
                        Blowes.
                         
                     
                  
               
               The former is reprehenſion: and it muſt alwaies goe before

the latter, which is moſt vſually and properly called Correction.
               
               Reprehenſion is a kinde of middle thing betwixt admonition and correction: it is a ſharpe admonition, but a milde correction.
               It is the rather to be vſed becauſe it may be a meanes to preuent ſtrokes and blowes, eſpecially in ingenuous, and good natured children (for 
                     Pro. 17. 10. 
                  a reproofe entereth more into him that is wiſe, then a hundred ſtripes into a foole) and becauſe it may be vſed, when it is not ſo meet to vſe ſtrokes and blowes: as when children are growne to man-age.
               The many good fruits which the holy Ghoſt noteth to proceed from due reproofe doe ſhew that it is a dutie whereof parents ought to make conſcience as they deſire to promote the good of their children: and ſo much the rather becauſe many good fruits redound to the parents that reproue, as well as to the children reproued. In regard of their good who are reproued, it is ſaid, 
                     Pro. 6. 23. 
                  Reproofes for inſtruction are the way of life: they cauſe 
                     & 15. 32. 
                  vnderſtanding; and make 
                     & 15. 5. 
                  prudent. In regard of their good who reproue, it is ſaid, 
                     & 24. 25. 
                  To them that rebuke ſhall be delight (that is, much comfort and matter of reioycing, ſo as they ſhall not need to repent what they haue done) and a bleſſing of good ſhall come vpon them, that is, either a bleſſing of good men, who will bleſſe, praiſe and commend them: or a bleſſing of good things, and that from the Lord who will reward them for this conſcionable performance of their dutie.
               Vpon theſe grounds 
                     Gen. 9. 25. & 34. 30. & 49. 4. holy men haue not ſpared to rebuke their children as there was occaſion. Though 1 Sam. 2. 23. Eli dum filijs moleſtus eſſe ſeuera increpatione recuſat, & illos & ſeipſum

               §. 45. Of parents cockering their children.
               
               Contrary is their too much doting on children, who are 
                     •
                  oth to giue them a foule word. Dauid (though otherwiſe a

                     ot Adoniah at any time in ſaying, why haſt thou done ſo? and like

enough it is, that alſo he ſo cockered his other rebellious ſonne Abſolom. Note the fearefull iſſue that followed thereupon both to father and children. Though their father would not diſpleaſe them, yet they cared not to diſpleaſe their father, yea to grieue his heart, and vex his ſoule. The like may all fooliſh doting parents looke for at their childrens hands. For firſt parents by neglect of this dutie highly diſpleaſe God: therefore in iuſt reuenge will God giue their children ouer to 
                     Omnia quae deliquerint filij, de parentibus requiruntur qui non erudierint ſilios ſuos. Orig. in Iob. lib. 1. diſpleaſe and vex them. Secondly, neglect of reproofe is a meanes to make children rude, preſumptuous, rebellious, and ſo careleſſe to pleaſe their parents. Yea all things where in children offend through want of education ſhall be required at their parents hands.
            
            
               §. 46. Of correcting children.
               
               The latter and more proper kinde of correction which is by ſtripes and blowes is alſo a meanes appointed by God to helpe the good nurture and education of children. It is the laſt remedy which a parent can vſe: a remedy which may doe good when nothing elſe can.
               It is by the holy Ghoſt both expreſly commanded, and alſo very oft preſſed vnder theſe and ſuch like phraſes, 
                     Pro. 19. 18. 
                  Ch

                     ſten thy ſonne: 
                  
                     & 29. 17. 
                  correct thy ſonne: 
                  
                     & 23. 13. 
                  with-hold not correction from the childe: 
                  
                     Verſ. 14. 
                  thou ſhalt ſmite him with the rod. Were there no other motiue, this were ſufficient. Gods charge was ſuch a motiue to Abraham, as at it he would haue ſacrificed his ſonne: 
                     Gen. 22. 2, 3. and wilt not thou at Gods command correct thy childe?
               It is further commended by Gods owne example, which is not only ſet forth in ſome particular inſtances, but by his generall conſtant dealing with all, and that as an eſpeciall token and fruit of his loue. For whom the Lord loueth he chaſteneth, 
                  
                     Heb. 12. 6, 8. 
                  and ſcourgeth euery ſonne whom he receiueth. If ye be without chaſtiſement wherof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards and not ſonnes. Let this example of God be well weighed, for it is of great weight. Who can better tell what kinde of dealing is fitteſt for children then God? Who can better nurture children then God? Who doth more truly aime at, and procure the good of children then God? Yea who doth more tender children then God? If God the father of ſpirits in wiſdome and

loue thus deale with his children, fathers of the fleſh may not thinke by the contrary to ſhew wiſdome or loue. Their wiſdome will be folly, their loue hatred. Vpon theſe grounds it is taken for a thing granted, that parents (who tender the good of their children as they ſhould) doe chaſtiſe their children as need requireth: for it is ſaid, that the 
                     Pro. 3. 12. Lord correcteth whom he loueth, as a father the ſonne in whom he delighteth. If parents vſed it not, this were no good inference to ſay, as a father: againe, as a thing without controuerſie it is ſaid, 
                     Heb. 12. 9. 
                  we haue had fathers of our fleſh which corrected vs.
               
               The grounds of the equitie of this dutie, reſpect partly the Reaſons to moue parents to correct. children corrected, and partly the parents that correct. In regard of children, it freeth them from much euill, and worketh in them much good.
               Correction is as phyſicke to purge out much corruption 1. Benefits of correction to the parties corrected. which lurketh in children, and as a ſalue to heale many wounds and ſores made by their folly. In which reſpect Solomon ſaith, that 
                     Pro. 22. 15. 
                  Fooliſhneſſe is bound in the heart of a childe, but the rod of correction ſhall driue it farre from him: and againe, 
                     & 20. 30. 
                  The blewneſſe of a wound is a purging medicine againſt euill: ſo doe ſtripes the inward parts of the belly. In regard of the inward operation of this phyſicke, correction is further ſaid to preſerue a childe from death, (
                     Pro. 23. 13. 
                  if thou beatest him he ſhall not die) and that not only from temporall death (as many children are thus preſerued from the Magiſtrates ſword) but alſo from eternall death (
                     Verſ. 14. 
                  thou ſhalt deliuer his ſoule from hell.) Note this ye cockering parents, whoſe ouer-much lenitie is very great crueltie. For may we not iuſtly count him a cruell parent, that ſhould ſuffer diſeaſes, boiles, ſores, and wounds to remaine, increaſe, and feſter in his childe, and giue him no phyſicke, nor apply any plaiſters, or medicines to him? Nay rather who ſeeth his ſonne running into a flaming fire, or deepe water, and would not hold him backe? Euen ſo cruell, and more cruell are they, who ſuffer their children to runne on in euill, rather then correct them.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Who can endure to make his owne childe ſmart, and to put him to paine?
                  
                     Anſw. The future fruit is more to be conſidered, then the preſent paine. Potions, pills, and coraſiues, are fulſome, bitter,

and painfull; but becauſe there is a neceſſitie of vſing them, and great miſchiefe is preuented by the vſe of them, wiſe parents will not forbeare them for the ſenſible bitterneſſe, and paine. Fitly doth the Apoſtle thus anſwer that obiection, No chaſtning for the 
                     
                        Heb. 12. 11. 
                     preſent ſeemeth to be ioyous, but grieuous; neuertheleſſe, afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſſe. This may be applied to parents corrections as well as to Gods.
                  The good which correction bringeth to children, is by Solomon noted in this and ſuch like phraſes, The rod giueth wiſdome: 
                     
                        Pro. 29. 15. for it maketh children obſerue, what is good, and what euill; what commendable, and what blame-worthy: and accordingly to doe the good, and leaue the euill, which is a great point of wiſdome.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Inſtruction will better doe this.
                  
                     Anſw. Inſtruction may giue them more knowledge, but it is correction which bringeth them to practiſe what they know, which is the 
                        Matt. 7. 24. chiefeſt point of wiſdome.
                  In regard of parents, due correcting of their children both freeth them of many inconueniences, and alſo bringeth to them 2. Benefits of correcting to him that correcteth. much quiet.
                  1. It ſpareth them much paines. For many admonitions oft repeated, and inculcated againe and againe, will not make many children ſo much to heed wholſome and good aduice, as a little correction. They are much more ſenſible of ſmart, then of words.
                  2. It preuenteth much griefe, ſhame, and vexation: for 
                        Pro. 17. 25. 
                     a fooliſh ſonne is a griefe to his father, and bitterneſſe to her that bare him. But it is 
                     
                        & 22. 15. 
                     the rod of correction that driueth away fooliſhneſſe, and ſo preuenteth that griefe and bitterneſſe.
                  
                  3. It freeth them from the guilt of their childrens ſinne, ſo as they are not acceſſarie thereto, as 
                        Sam. 3. 13. 
                     Eli was. For correction is the laſt remedie that a parent can vſe: if by that he can doe no good, it is preſuppoſed that he hath done his vttermoſt endeuour: in which reſpect, though the childe die in his ſinne, yet the parent hath deliuered his owne ſoule.
                  The quiet which is brought to parents by correcting their children, is thus noted out by Solomon, 
                     
                        Pro. 29. 17. 
                     Correct thy ſonne, and he ſhall giue thee rest, yea he ſhall giue delight vnto thy ſoule. For children well nurtured, and by correction kept in a filiall awe,

will ſo carrie themſelues, as their parents may reſt ſomewhat ſecure, and not diſquiet themſelues (as they doe with children ſet at libertie) yea, as trees well pruned, and ground well tilled, they will bring forth pleaſant and abundant fruit; and ſo their parents will haue iuſt cauſe to reioyce in them.
               
            
            
               §. 47. A direction to parents in correcting their children.
               
               For well vſing this biting coraſiue of correction, parents muſt haue reſpect to the matter for which they doe correct, and to their manner of correcting.
               In regard of the matter, theſe three things muſt be noted. Three things noted in the matter, for which correction is to be giuen.
               
               1. That they be ſure there is a fault committed: that ſo there be iuſt cauſe of correcting: elſe more hurt then good will proceed from thence. If a coraſiue be laid where there is no ſore, it will make one. If correction be vniuſtly giuen, it may prouoke to wrath, but will doe little good. This is it wherein earthly fathers are taxed, and made vnlike to God, for that many times they correct after their owne pleaſure: which is a point of great iniuſtice. 
                     Heb. 12. 10.
               
               2. That the fault be made knowne to the childe corrected: and he apparantly conuinced thereof. Correction muſt be for inſtruction, which cannot be, except the childe know why he is corrected: for it is all one to him, as if he were corrected for no fault, if he know not his fault. God thus a firſt proceeded with the ſerpent, 
                     Gen. 3. 11, &c.
                   with Eue, and with Adam. Thus Iudges proceed in puniſhing malefactors. Yea thus will men deale with a dog. Should they not much more with a childe?
               3. That the faults be ſuch eſpecially, as the parents can ſhew to their children (if at leaſt they be of ſo much diſcretion) to be againſt Gods word; as ſwearing, lying, pilfring, and the like: for 1. theſe are moſt dangerous faults, and therefore more carefully to be purged out. 2. the childe corrected will thus be the better euicted of his fault, the more condemne himſelfe, and more contentedly beare the correction.
               In regard of the manner of correcting, foure generall, and foure Foure general rules for the manner of correcting. particular rules are to be obſerued.
               The generall rules are theſe.
               1. An eye muſt be had to Gods manner of correcting his children, and in particular of Gods correcting the parent himſelfe:

no better generall direction can be giuen: for Gods patterne is a perfect rule.
               2. Prayer muſt be made by parents for themſelues and for their children: for themſelues, to be directed in doing it: for their children, to be bettered by it. Thus will good Phyſitians in miniſtring phyſicke. In all duties is prayer to be vſed; eſpecially in this: for a parent is ready, partly through his owne intemperate paſſion, and partly through the childs impatiencie, to fall into one extreme or other. This is not to impoſe vpon all, whenſoeuer they take vp the rod, to goe and make a ſolemne prayer, but to lift vp the heart for direction and bleſſing.
               3. Correction muſt be giuen in loue. All things muſt be done in 
                  1 Cor. 16. 14. 
                  loue: much more this, that carieth a ſhew of anger and hatred. In loue they will giue phyſicke to their children, and ſplinter a ioynt, if need be. God correcteth his children in loue: ſo muſt 
                     Reu. 3. 19. parents. Loue will make them doe it with tenderneſſe and compaſſion.
               4. Correction muſt be giuen in a milde moode, when the affections 
                     Nunquam, iratus qui accedit ad poenam, mediocritatem tenebit, Cic. Offic. lib. 1. Ier. 10. 11. Foure particular rules for the manner of correcting. are well ordered, and not diſtempered with choler, rage, furie, and other like paſſions. Diſturbed paſſions caſt a miſt before the vnderſtanding, ſo as a man cannot diſcerne what is enough, what too much. When paſſion is moued, correction muſt be deferred. God correcteth in meaſure.
               
               The particular rules are theſe.
               1. Due order muſt be kept. Correction by word muſt goe before correction by the rod. 
                     Reu. 3. 19. Vt ad vrendum & ſecandum medici, ſic nos ad caſtigandū, rarò, inuitique veniamus, nec vnquam niſi neceſſario, ſinulla reperietur alia medicina. Cic. Offic. lib. 1. 
                  I rebuke and chaſten, ſaith the Lord. Thus a parent will ſhew that he taketh no delight in ſmiting his childe: it is neceſſitie that forceth him thereunto. Thus a parent ſheweth himſelfe like to God, who doth not puniſh willingly, Lam. 3. 33. Phyſitians, when they miniſter ſtrong phyſicke, will giue a preparatiue: rebuke may be as a preparatiue. Good and pitifull Chirurgions will try all other meanes before they come to launce and ſeere.
               2. Due reſpect muſt be had to the partie corrected: if he be young and tender, the lighter correction muſt be vſed. Solomon oft mentioneth a rod, as meeteſt for a childe; for that is the lighteſt correction. So if the childe be of a flexible and ingenuous diſpoſition, ſoone ſneapt, the correction muſt accordingly be moderated.

If he be well growne, and withall be ſtout, and ſtubborne, the correction may be more ſeuere.
               3. Due reſpect muſt be had to the fault: Sinnes directly Cauendum ne maior poena, quàm culpa ſit. Cic. loc. citat. againſt God, open, notorious, ſcandalous ſinnes, knowne ſinnes, ſinnes often committed, in which they are growne vp, and whereof they haue gotten an habit, are with greater ſeueritie to be corrected.
               4. A parent muſt behold his owne faults in correcting his childes: ſo more compaſſion will be wrought in him.
            
            
               §. 48. Of parents too much indulgency.
               
               Contrary to this dutie of correcting are two extremes.

                     1. Too much lenitie.
                     2. Too much ſeueritie.
                  
               
               Many ſo cocker their children, as they will ſuffer them to 
                     Qui non corripiunt filios ſuos, & eorum animas igni inextinguibili in interitum tradunt, & ſemetipſos in furorem iudicij dem
                           •
                        rgunt. Orig. in Iob. lib. 1. 1 Sam. 2. 29. run into any miſdemeanour, rather then correct them. They cannot endure to heare their children cry: and therefore their children muſt be pleaſed in all their humours and euill deſires. Theſe parents bring ſhame to themſelues, and miſchiefe vpon their children: for God is oft forced to correct ſuch. Heauy are Gods corrections: and oft light on parent and childe both: as appeareth by the iudgement on Eli and his ſonnes: for ſuch parents make themſelues acceſſary to their childrens ſinnes: yea alſo to the iudgements laid vpon their children. God ſaith of ſuch parents, that they honour their children aboue God. It is therefore a fond indulgency which maketh parents regard neither Gods honour, nor their owne or childrens ſafetie.
               Mothers for the moſt part offend herein, who are ſo farre from performing this dutie themſelues, as they are much offended with their husbands if they doe it. And to proclaime their folly to all the world, they cannot commit their children to a Tutor or Schoole-maſter, but with a ſtrait charge, that they correct them not.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Correction maketh children ſots and blocks.
                  
                     Anſw. If Gods ſpirit deſerue to haue more credence then ſuch fooliſh women, that obiection is moſt falſe, for we heard §. 46. before how correction giueth wiſdome, and driueth out fooliſhneſſe.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. Mothers may be the more borne with herein,

becauſe with long trouble they did beare, and with great trauell bring forth their children.
                  
                     Anſw. That may be a good motiue for them to ſeeke the true good of their children, that ſo their trouble and trauell may not be in vaine: but not to vphold them in the broad way that leadeth to deſtruction.
               
            
            
               §. 49. Of parents too much ſeueritie in correcting their children.
               
               They who offend in the other extreme of ſeuerity, of the 
                     Patres non oportet aſperos eſſe circa filios. Cyp. Teſtim. l. 3. c. 71. two are the more vnnaturall parents; they offend directly againſt the firſt branch of this text (Prouoke not to wrath.) Nothing more prouoketh then immoderate ſeuerity: for
               1. It argueth no loue in the parent, but rather hatred, at leaſt wrath, and other ſuch like diſtempered affections.
               2. It ſofteneth not the childes heart, but hardeneth it rather. Uerendum ne, ſi parentes ob quaevis errata filios coarguant, frontem tandem ipſi perfricent. Greg. Naz. ad Vital.
               
               3. It maketh him dull, and ſtupid, and cleane peruerteth the right and true end of correction.
               4. It oft maketh a childe thinke of doing ſome miſchiefe to his parent or himſelfe.
               That parents may the rather take heed of this extreme, I will briefly note wherein exceſſe in ſeueritie is ſhewed.
               It is ſhewed, when correction is giuen
               1. For no fault. In this caſe, though correction be neuer ſo light, it is too ſeuere.
               2. For ſmall faults, in wrath and furie, though the ſtripes be few and light, yet the parents behauiour is too much ſeueritie.
               3. To children that are young and tender, or ſoft, milde and ingenuous, as if they were in ſome yeeres, the moſt obſtinate and peruerſe that could be.
               4. Too often: for euery thing done amiſſe: whereas parents Multa quae vident parentes videre ſe diſſimulent; multa ſe minime audiſſe fingant quae auribus infixa habent. Greg. Naz. ad Vital. ſhould ſeeme not to ſee or heare many things which they ſee, and heare.
               5. Too ſorely: ſo as the childe is lamed, or ſome way ſo hurt as he ſhall feele it as long as he liueth.
            
            
               §. 50. Of Parents care in prouiding fit callings for their children.
               
               Hauing laid downe ſuch duties of parents as eſpecially reſpect

the childhood of children, I proceed to lay forth ſuch as haue reſpect to their riper yeeres wherein they are to be placed forth.
               
                  
                     
                        Here we are to note
                        1. The kindes of thoſe duties.
                     
                     
                        2. The meanes of performing them.
                         
                     
                  
               
               The kindes may be drawne to two heads.
               1. Prouiding fit places and callings for them to exerciſe their gifts.
               2. Prouiding fit mariages for them.
               We heard §. 31. before how children were to be trained vp, and fitted to ſome good calling euen in their childhood. Now further, when by vertue of good education they are inabled to diſcharge the functions and duties of a calling, and by yeeres they are well growne vp, ſo as it is time they ſhould be ſet to ſome particular calling:
               
                  Parents ought to prouide fit callings for their children, and fit Fit callings to be prouided. places for them to exerciſe the gifts which by nature or education they haue gotten. For example, If children haue beene brought vp in learning, parents muſt vſe what lawfull and honeſt meanes they can to ſettle them in ſuch a place and courſe as they may profeſſe and exerciſe their gifts, according to their ſeuerall kindes, be it Diuinitie, Law, Phyſicke, or the like: or if they haue beene brought vp in any trade, to prouide that they may ſet vp (as we ſpeake) and exerciſe their trade. The two firſt children that euer were borne of woman, 
                     Gen. 4. 2. 
                  Cain and Abel, were placed forth in ſeuerall callings; and without doubt their places were ſo ordered by their parents. The like may be gathered out of theſe phraſes, 
                     & 25. 27. 
                  Eſau was a man of the field, and Iaakob dwelt intents. 
                  1 Sam. 8. 1. It is noted of Samuel, that he made his two ſonnes Iudges. Had they beene as faithfull in well vſing their places, as their father was carefull in prouiding them, they might haue liued well themſelues, and done much good to others. Iſhai hauing many ſonnes, had a care hereof: for 1 Sam. 17. 13. he ſent his three eldeſt ſonnes to the war; and placed them in a ſouldiers courſe of life: 
                     &. 16. 11. his youngeſt he made a ſhepheard, which was in thoſe daies and places a calling of greater reckoning then now it is with vs.
               1. Thus ſhall they make vſe of that abilitie whereunto by The benefits of a fit calling.
                  
their parents prouidence, and their owne diligence they haue attained: otherwiſe that abilitie may ſoone be loſt. Doth not daily experience ſhew that many who haue beene well trained vp by their parents in learning, ſo farre as they haue beene fit to haue entred into the miniſterie, for want of place and imploiment, haue in time ſo forgotten all, as if they had neuer beene trained vp in learning: and ſo in other ſciences.
               2. Thus come they to doe much more good in Church or Common-wealth: till men be placed in diſtinct callings, they are but fitting and preparing for future times. I denie not but that both Church and Common-wealth may reape much benefit by the paines and labour of the younger ſort, who are trained vp vnder others: but moſt properly are they counted members of the Church and Common-wealth, and actuall inſtruments of the good thereof, who haue ſome particular diſtinct calling, whereby they doe good to others.
               3. Thus they come to liue of themſelues, and to be able to releeue others alſo. All the time of their education, they are commonly at the charge of others: at leaſt, though by their paines they may gaine much, yet the gaine returnes to others: they themſelues for the moſt part haue but a bare maintenance, meat, drinke and cloth (as we ſay:) little haue they to lay vp for themſelues for the time to come, or to giue to others for the preſent.
               4. They thus come to traine vp others againſt after times, as they themſelues haue beene trained vp: whereby a continuall and perpetuall ſucceſſion of all kindes of callings, is from time to time preſerued: and thus Family, Church, and Common-wealth vpheld and maintained. In ſhort time would all callings and functions vtterly decay, if a continuall ſupplie were not thus made.
            
            
               §. 51. Direction for parents in prouiding callings for their children.
               
               Two eſpeciall cautions are to be obſerued by parents in Cautions in prouiding callings. prouiding callings for their children.
               1. That ſuch callings be prouided as their children haue beene trained vp vnto, and are in ſome meaſure fitted and enabled to performe the duties thereof: as to prouide a Miniſters

place for him that hath beene brought vp in learning and ſtudied diuinity: ſo in other callings ſuch, as their children may be their crafts-maſters therein. Thus ſhall their children doe the more good therein, both to others and themſelues. Bezaleel and Aholiab were choſen to build the tabernacle becauſe they were filled with wiſdome to worke all manner of worke: likewiſe 
                     Exod. 35. 35. the ſeruants of Hirom were choſen to hew Cedar trees for the temple, becauſe among the Iewes there were not any that 
                  1 King. 5. 6. 
                  could skill to hew timber, like vnto the Sidonians. Pharaoh was carefull to haue men of actiuity rulers ouer his cattell. 
                  
                     Gen. 47. 6.
               
               2. That ſuch meanes be vſed for prouiding a calling as parents in vſing them may with faith call vpon God for his bleſſing. They that by lawfull meanes are brought into a calling whereunto they are fitted, are ſet therein by God, as is implied by this phraſe, as God hath called euery one, &c. A lawfull entrance into a calling is a matter of great moment: he that ſo entreth may in a right vſe thereof caſt himſelfe vpon Gods bleſſing, and with ſtrong confidence expect the ſame, ſaying as the Prophet did, Lord I haue not thruſt in my ſelfe thou

                  1. Extreme in the defect.
               
               The extreme in the defect contrary to a parents prouident care in prouiding a fit calling, is, a careleſſe neglect of children after they are well educated, a leauing them to ſhift for themſelues.

It is noted of the rauenous fowles that haue ſharpe talents, that ſo ſoone as they perceiue their young ones to be able to fly, they will flap and beat them with their wings, and driue them out of their neſts, and after that take no further care of them.

                     Anſw. Meanes rightly vſed are ſubordinate to Gods prouidence, and by them doth God manifeſt his prouidence and bring his counſell to paſſe: to neglect meanes is to thwart and

croſſe the diuine prouidence. It is therefore well done to rely on Gods prouidence: but ill done to neglect the meanes of effecting it. Gods bleſſing is beſt diſcerned in the vſe of meanes.

Experience ſheweth that this is the bane of Church and commonwealth. Hereby it falleth out in the politique body, as it would in a naturall body; if the hand ſhould take vpon it to ſee, or the leg to heare, or the foot to taſte, what could from thence be expected but ruine to the body? Tradeſ-men oft vndoe themſelues, their families and friends, by vndertaking ſuch trades as they haue no skill in, or whereof they are not crafts-maſters. The more excellent the calling is, the more miſchiefe is done by this greedy prepoſterouſneſſe. This extreme is ſo much worſe then the former, as it is worſe to doe much hurt, then no good.
                  2. When they make no conſcience of the meanes which 2.

                      one in his place? if God haue not placed him, with what faith can he ſeeke a bleſſing? with what hope can he expect a blessing? Much terror is by this meanes brought to many men conſcience: and they are oft in a great ſtrait, not knowing whether it be fitteſt for them to retaine, or relinquiſh the

                  But by the way to reſolue that doubt, if one that hath vnlawfully entred be fit for the performance of his place, it

then ſafeſt for him to ſeeke pardon for the former offence, and reconciliation with God, and vpon true and vnfained repentance to hold the place (if at leaſt the law vnder which he liueth eſtabliſh him therein) and be ſo much the more faithfull in the diſcharge of the duties thereof.

                  Take wiues to your ſonnes, and giue your daughters to husbands: and thus the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 7. 36. 
                  If any man thinke that he behaueth himſelfe vncomely toward his virgin, if ſhe paſſe the floure of her age, and need ſo require, let them marry. This direction was giuen in times of perſecution, when by reaſon of the preſent neceſſity it was better not to marry: if then a parent ought to be carefull (need requiring) to prouide a mariage for his daughter, much more ought he in times of peace. Holy parents commended by the Holy Ghoſt haue beene carefull in performing this duty, as 
                     Gen. 24. 4. 
                  Abraham,

                     Gen. 21. 21. 
                  Hagar had learned this duty in Abrahams houſe. But the perfect patterne (which ſurpaſſeth all other examples) is of

               1. Children may not marry without conſent of parents, (as was Treat. 5. §. 16, 17. before ſhewed) Parents therefore muſt be carefull in time to prouide for them.
               2. Parents are to children in Gods place: they muſt therefore take vpon them this care of God.
               3. Mariage is the meanes which the Lord hath ſanctified to preſerue our bodies chaſte and vndefiled: as parents therefore deſire to keepe their children from vncleanneſſe and pollution, they muſt take care that this meanes be vſed. Not only holy Apoſtles, but alſo Liberos qui voluptatibus nimis ſunt dediti dabis operam vt coniugio aſtringas: vinculum enim hoc eſt tutiſſimum inventutis. Plut. de Inſtit. lib. heathen Philoſophers, and that by the light of nature, haue found this to be the fitteſt courſe.

               §. 54. Direction to parents in prouiding mariages.
               
               Two cautions are to be obſerued of parents in prouiding mariages for their children.
               1. That the match which they prouide be meet: ſo ſaid God when he was about to prouide a match for Adam, I will 
                  
                     Gen. 2. 18. 
                  make him an helpe meet for him. Therefore See Treat. 2. Part. 1. §. 9, 10 &c.
                   the match prouided muſt not be too neere of kin, of a contrary religion, of too vnequall an age, of too great diſparity in eſtate. Theſe things will hinder loue, and cauſe diſdaine and hatred of one another.
               2. Though the match may ſeeme meet in the parents eie, yet he may not force his childe thereto. Could a fitter match haue beene found out for Rebekah then Iſaak? yet Rebekahs friends 
                     Gen. 24. 57. What to be done if children like not ſuch a match as parents thinke meet. Non cogitur filius-familias vxorem ducere. Digeſt. l. 23. c. 2. §. 21. asked her conſent. I denie not but parents may vſe all manner of faire meanes to moue their children to yeeld to that which they ſee good for them: but if they cannot moue them to yeeld, to referre the matter to God, and not againſt their childrens minds to force them. When God had made a moſt meet match for Adam, he brought her to the man: namely to ſee how he would like her. For the neereſt bond of all is betwixt man and wife; a man muſt leaue father and mother, and 
                  
                     Gen. 2. 22. Sacra in hoc negotio parentibus authoritas eſſe debet: ſed tenenda eſt media ratio, vt ſponte ac mutuo conſenſu inter ſe contrahant partes. Cal. in Gen. 24. verſ. 57. 
                  cleaue vnto his wife; man and wife muſt alwaies liue together: great reaſon therefore that at the firſt ioyning them together there be a mutuall liking of one another, leſt euer after there be a perpetuall diſlike: and though the authority of parents ought in this caſe to be inuiolable, yet a middle courſe is ſo to be held, as the parties may willingly with a mutuall conſent ioyne themſelues together.
            
            
               §. 55. Of the extremes contrary to parents care in prouiding fit mariages for their children.
               
               The extreme in the defect is, when parents careleſly let their children paſſe the floure of their age: and neuer conſider whether need require that they ſhould mary or no. Their children may ſit long enough before they ſeeke out a match for them, vnleſſe it be brought to them: and when one is offered though it be neuer ſo fit, yet except they may make an aduantage thereof to themſelues, they will hardly yeeld to it. Thus they make their children to ſeeke out mariages for themſelues, and

without their conſent to make them vp: or elſe to liue in diſcontent, 
                     Si filij innupti feruore aetatis in conſuetudinem ſornicandi inciderint, vos parentes in die iudicij rationem deo eſtis reddituri. Conſtit. Apoſt. l. 4. c. 11. if not in vncleanneſſe. By the careleſneſſe of parents in this reſpect are children oft made a prey to the deuill: whereof at the day of iudgement parents ſhall giue an account to God.
               The extreme in the exceſſe is, See Treat. 2. Part. 1. §. 2. when parents through a couetous deſire to get great and rich matches for their children, marie them before they be of yeares of diſcretion to like or diſlike, to know what is meet or vnmeet; or able to performe euen the eſſentiall duties of mariages: ſeldome doe ſuch vnlawfull mariages proſper.
               In a like exceſſe doe they offend who for outward aduantages match their children to ſuch as by nature are vnfit for mariage, to ideots, to See Treat. 2. Part. 1. §. 11, 12. idolaters, to profane perſons, or they care not to whom. And if their children like not theſe matches, they will doe to the vttermoſt of their power what they can to force them thereunto. Many miſchiefes ordinarily fall out vpon ſuch mariages, as vtter diſlike betwixt husband and wife, continuall complaining one of another, inquiring after diuorce, or any other ſeparation, wiſhing, yea practiſing one anothers death. To all theſe miſchiefes doe parents, the cauſe thereof, make themſelues acceſſary.
            
            
               §. 56. Of parents prouiding a ſtocke for callings and mariages of their children.
               
               An eſpeciall outward meanes whereby parents may be the better inabled to prouide fit callings and mariages for their children, is, before hand to lay vp ſome ſtocke, or competent portion for their children. This is compriſed vnder that generall prouiſion, whereof he that is careleſſe is counted by the Apoſtle 1 Tim. 5. 8. 
                  worſe then an inſidell: but more expreſly is it noted in theſe words, 2 Cor. 12. 14. 
                  Parents ought to lay vp for their children: and commended in 
                     Gen. 25. 5, 6. 
                  Abrahams example.
               While children are vnder their parents they haue no meanes to lay vp for themſelues: for all their ſeruice is for their parents. But in regard of the times wherein we liue, it is needfull for ſetting vp in a good calling, and for obtaining a fit match, that children haue ſome ſtocke and portion. It

lieth therefore vpon the parents, and their duty it is to prouide it.

                  Among other needfull cautions for parents to be obſerued in laying vp for their children, theſe three are eſpecially to be noted.
                  1. That iuſtly they come by that which they lay vp: and lay nothing towards a childs portion which is any way vniuſtly gotten; for the treaſures of wickedneſſe profit nothing: they may 
                        Pro. 10. 2. proue a fire to conſume parents themſelues, their children, their houſe, and whole poſterity.
                  2. That they couet not too much to make their children rich, and for that purpoſe liue meanly and baſely themſelues, yea and depriue themſelues of many neceſſaries. An egregious 
                        Eccl. 5. 12. point of folly is this, which Solomon hath much taxed.
                  3. That all needfull duties of charity to the poore, and of iuſtice to the Church and common-wealth be performed, and pretext of laying vp for children hinder none of theſe.
               
            
            
               §. 57. Of the extremes contrary to a parents prouiding portions for his children.
               
               The extremes contrary to the forenamed dutie are theſe:
               
                  
1. When parents liue at the vttermoſt extent of their eſtate, and from time to time ſpend all their reuenues or all their gaines, and ſo are ſcarce able to make euen at quarter day, or yeares end. What ſtocke or portion can they lay vp for children?
               2. When parents liue aboue their eſtate, and ſpend riotouſly their ordinary gaines, or reuenues, and for other neceſſary affaires are forced to runne into debt. Many are ſo farre from helping their children in this kinde, as they are maine hinderance vnto them, vrging their eldeſt ſonne eſpecially who is their heire, to be bound for them, and ſo lay ſuch a burden on his backe, as (to vſe the common phraſe) they make it cracke againe.
               3. When parents haue enough for themſelues and their children, and yet ſo couetouſly dote vpon their wealth, as they will not beſtow a groat to helpe them in calling and mariage, but ſay they keepe all for them. What a wretched and fooliſh diſpoſition is this, that they ſhould ſtill lay vp more and more for their children, and yet refuſe to beſtow any part thereof vpon them in their greateſt need, when it might redound to their greateſt benefit? God oft meeteth with ſuch couetous miſers, and croſſeth their purpoſes, by making ſtrangers to enioy that which they greedily hoorded vp.
            
            
               §. 58. Of parents last ſpeech to their children.
               
               The laſt dutie which parents owe to their children, is, when they ceaſe to be parents: that is, when they are going out of this world. Their dutie at that time in generall is to doe what lieth in them, that it may goe well with their children after their departure. Both See §. 6. the reaſons which are oft vrged by the Holy Ghoſt, to ſtir vp parents to yeeld obedience to God, taken from extent of Gods bleſſing (in this kinde of phraſe, 
                     Pro. 20. 7. 
                  Bleſſed ſhall their children be after them) and Gods 
                     Deut. 5. 29. promiſes made to that purpoſe doe proue as much.
               For the better performing of this dutie, three generall points, tending both to the temporall, and alſo to the ſpirituall good of children, are to be obſerued: and two particular points moſt tending to their temporall eſtate.
               The three generals are theſe.

                     
                        
1. Good direction.
                     2. Faithfull prayer.
                     3. A wiſe choiſe of ſome friends to be as parents to them.
                  
               
               1. Parents on their deathbed to leaue good leſſons to their children. For direction. When parents obſerue their time to draw neere, they ought to commend ſome wiſe and wholſome precepts vnto their children, the better to direct them in their Chriſtian courſe. So did 
                     Gen. 28. 2, 4. 
                  Iſaak, and 
                     & 49. 1. &c.
                   
                  Iaakob.
               
               
                  Ob. Theſe Patriarchs had an extraordinarie ſpirit of prophecying, & by vertue thereof foretold their children things to come.
               
                  Anſw. 
                  See Treat. 5. §. 9. They ſuſtained a double perſon: one of a prophet, another of a father: as prophets, they had an extraordinarie ſpirit; as parents, they performed ordinarie dutie: by their extraordinarie ſpirit, they foretold things to come: the ordinarie dutie which they performed, was to direct their children how to carrie themſelues in thoſe times to come. For their propheſies were not only predictions, but alſo inſtructions, to direct and teach them what to doe. What they did by an extraordinarie ſpirit in extraordinarie things, we muſt doe in ordinarie duties by the ordinarie ſpirit of vnderſtanding and wiſdome which the Lord giueth vs. But the direction which 
                     Gen. 28. 2. &c.
                   
                  Iſaak gaue to Iaakob, when he ſent him to Laban, was no extraordinarie propheſie: nor that which 1 Chro 28. 9. 
                  Dauid, when he was old, gaue to Solomon: and againe, 1 King. 2. 2, 3, &c.
                   when he lay on his death-bed. Now theſe things are thus written for our imitation. And great reaſon there is to imitate thoſe holy men in theſe things. For
               1. The words of a dying parent are commonly moſt regarded: his laſt words doe make a deepe impreſſion (
                     Gen. 50. 16. this doe the brethren of Ioſeph preſſe vpon him.) If euer therefore there be a time ſeaſonable for a parent to giue good inſtructions to his children, then is the time when parents are cleane departing from their children.
               2. Thus ſhall a parent manifeſt his true affection, and earneſt deſire of his childrens good: for now they cannot thinke that he ſeeketh his owne eaſe, and profit, more then their good: as at other times ſome will be ready to ſay of their parents inſtructions and admonitions, Our parents know what is good for themſelues.
               
               That the laſt words of parents may be the more ſeaſonably and Direction. profitably deliuered to their children, they muſt note, on the one

ſide, what euils their children are moſt prone vnto, what temptations they are moſt aſſaulted withall, what ſnares they are moſt like to fall into; and on the other ſide, what vertues and graces are moſt needfull for them, and wherein they faile moſt, and accordingly they muſt order and frame their laſt words. Note for a patterne herein 
                     Gen. 28, 2, &c.
                   
                  Iſaaks counſell to Iaakob, when he ſent him to Laban, and thought he ſhould neuer ſee him againe: and 1 King. 2. 2, 3. 
                  Dauids to his ſonne Solomon.
               
            
            
               §. 59. Of Parents laſt bleſſing to their children.
               
               II. Concerning the prayers of parents for their children, I noted it §. 4. before to be a generall dutie neuer to be omitted: yet here in particular I mention it againe, becauſe a parents bleſſing conſiſteth therein eſpecially: and then is the moſt proper time for parents to beſtow a bleſſing on their children, as 
                     Gen. 28. 3. 
                  Iſaak, 
                  
                     & 48. 15. 
                  Iaakob, 
                  1 Chro. 29. 19. 
                  Dauid, and others did. Let parents therefore as they commend their owne ſoules into Gods hand, ſo commend their children vnto Gods grace and bleſſing. Gods prouidence is a good inheritance: many children doe thereby exceedingly proſper, though they haue but ſmall outward meanes; whereas others that haue great meanes vſed for their good, come to ruine; Gods curſe following them. Now no ſuch meanes can be thought of to procure Gods bleſſing, or to with-hold his curſe, as the faithfull prayers of parents for their children; eſpecially when parents are leauing their children, and going to God.
            
            
               §. 60. Of parents care to commend their children to ſome faithfull friends.
               
               III. The third generall point of making choiſe of ſome faithfull friends to commend their children vnto, is eſpecially in behalfe of ſuch as are not of ſufficient age and diſcretion to looke to themſelues, or to thoſe weightie affaires which belong vnto them. The friends, which in this caſe are made choiſe of, ought to be ſuch as the parents themſelues by good experience haue found to be honeſt, wiſe, faithfull, and louing to them and theirs; whom parents are to ſet in their owne place for the good of their children. This meanes did Dauid vſe when he was old in the behalfe 1 Chro. 22. 17. & 28. 21. of his ſonne Solomon. Many children haue found much helpe thereby. Such may make a good ſupply of the departure of parents. Theſe are ſo much the more needfull, by how much

the more vnſtable, and vnbridled youth is; and by how much the leſſe able children are to helpe and guide themſelues.
            
            
               §. 61. Of parents neglect of their children for the time to come.
               
               Contrary to a parents prouidence for the good of his children after his departure, is the careleſneſſe of parents for the time to come. They thinke the world is gone with them when they are gone, and therefore they will take no thought for the future times that ſhall be after them; as if it were enough for euery one to looke to his owne time. There may ſeeme to be more ſelfe-loue in ſuch parents then loue of their children, in that their care determineth with their owne time, and extendeth not it ſelfe to the time and continuance of their children. Hence is it, that not a word of direction and exhortation commeth out of their mouths to their children when they are departing, no bleſſing that they will leaue behinde them, no friends ſhall be deputed by them, to be as parents to their children. Let God prouide, ſay they. But where there is a referring of matters to Gods prouidence, without the vſe of thoſe meanes which God hath warranted and commended by his word, there can be little hope that God ſhould take care of that which is ſo commended to him. Such men doe not in faith depend vpon Gods prouidence, but make the very name thereof a pretext to caſt off that care, which God as a bounden dutie requireth of them. As there is little loue of their children in ſuch parents, ſo there is leſſe zeale of Gods glory: for a parents care of his childrens welfare, eſpecially of their continuing to feare and ſerue the Lord after their owne departure out of this world, is an eſpeciall meanes of preſeruing Gods feare in the world, and propagating it from age to age: ſo as this neglect is a greater fault then many are aware of.
            
            
               §. 62. Of parents making a Will before they die.
               
               The two particular things to be obſerued by parents for manifeſtation of their prouident care ouer their children for the time to come, euen after their departure, eſpecially in regard of their temporall eſtate, are theſe,

                     1. That they make a will.
                     2. That they leaue their eſtates to their children.
                  
               
               1. It hath beene an ancient commendable practiſe both among A Will to be made. Gods people, and others alſo, that haue beene guided with

common ciuilitie, when they who haue any eſtate, waxe old, or ſicke, and haue any occaſion of expecting death offered vnto them, to make their laſt Will and teſtament. This is ſet forth in the old Teſtament vnder this phraſe (Put thy houſe in order.) A dutie it is expreſly 2 King. 20. 1. commanded by God: and that not without good reaſon. For
               1. A parents Will is an eſpeciall meanes to ſettle peace among children after his departure, and to make them content with that allowance which he hath ſet out vnto them, becauſe by the Will they know it was their fathers pleaſure they ſhould haue ſuch and ſuch a portion. If controuerſies ſhould ariſe, yet a Will is a meanes for the law ſpeedily to determine the ſame without any tedious and chargeable ſuits: for the Apoſtle taketh it for a ruled caſe, that no man diſanulleth or addeth any thing to a mans' teſtament. 
                  
                     Gal. 3. 15.
               
               2. After a parent hath made his Will, he may the more quietly ſettle himſelfe for heauenly contemplations, and preparations to death: and thinke of ſuch good inſtructions as are moſt fit to giue as his farewell to his children: and the more willingly expect the moment of his diſſolution: and the more patiently ſubmit himſelfe to the very ſtroke of death.
               In performing this dutie, a man muſt both obſerue a fit time, Direction. and alſo take good aduice. The fit time is while his vnderſtanding is good, and his memorie perfect: ſo as he may call to minde his debts, what he oweth, and what is owing to him: as alſo what goods he hath to beſtow, and with diſcretion and wiſdome order his eſtate. And becauſe through the cauils which many vnconſcionable lawyers and others are like to make, his true meaning may be peruerted, it is meet to haue the aduice of ſuch as can in diſtinct words and phraſes ſo expreſſe his meaning, as they ſhall be free from exception. Matters of weight are wiſely to be managed.
            
            
               §. 63. Of neglecting to make a Will.
               
               Contrary is the daily practiſe of too many parents who are not willing to make any will at all: or elſe on vaine hope that they may liue longer, and when they are ſicke, vpon conceit that they may recouer, or at leaſt longer continue to enioy the vſe of their vnderſtanding and memory, put off the making of their Will till it be too late: and ſo die without Will,

or make ſuch a Will as miniſtreth more matter of ſute, then if they had no Will at all; either becauſe doubt is made whether he that made it had his vnderſtanding and memory or no: or becauſe his Will is ſo abrupt and ambiguous, as his meaning cannot be knowne. The miſchiefes that follow theſe neglects, Inconuenience of dying without a Will. are many. As

                     1. Diſcredit to the partie deceaſed.
                     2. Contentions among his ſuruiuing children.
                     3. Waſting a great part, if not his whole eſtate, in ſuits of law.
                     4. Defeating many creditors of their due debt.
                  
               
               The reaſon which maketh many to put off the making of their Will is a fooliſh conceit, that if a mans Will be once made, then he muſt needs die out of hand. But what ground haue men for any ſuch conceit? If ſicknes grow vpon a man, ſo long as his Will is vnmade his minde is vnſetled, his minde being vnſetled, the phyſicke that is miniſtred to him cannot ſo kindly worke; ſo as his death may be the more haſtened for not making a Will. Beſides, if his ſpeech faile before his vnderſtanding, the thought that then he ſhall die without a Will may ſo perplex him, as his departure will be very vnquiet and troubleſome.
            
            
               §. 64. Of parents leauing their eſtate to their children when they die.
               
               It was §. 56. before ſhewed that parents were to lay vp a portion for their children againſt their entrance into a calling, and mariage: There is a further duty required when they are going out of the world, namely that they leaue their whole eſtate 
                  The eſtate of parents to be left to their children. 
                  to their children. (Where I ſay whole, I exempt not workes of charity, nor payment of debts, which is a point of iuſtice, but I include more then is giuen as portions or ſtockes in their life time.) That eſtate eſpecially which parents haue receiued from their progenitors are they moſt bound to leaue vnto their children. It is expreſly recorded that Abraham gaue all 
                  
                     Gen. 25. 5. 
                  that he had to Iſaak. Gods law did prouide for this among the Iewes: for a man might not ſell his land to cut it off from 
                     Leu. 25. 23. his poſterity. This was it that made Naboth refuſe to ſell his vineyard to Ahab, as his anſwer implieth, God forbid that I 
                  1 King. 21. 3.
                  
                  ſhould giue the inheritance of my fathers vnto thee: becauſe it was the inheritance of his fathers, that is, he had receiued it from them, he thought it vnlawfull to depriue his children of it. This phraſe (if children, then heires) taketh it for a granted 
                     Rom. 8. 17. truth that children haue a right to their parents eſtate: and if they haue a right thereto, they may not be defeated thereof.
               God giueth wealth vnto parents but for their life time: in which time they are but as Guardians vnto Gods children, and are accountable to God: ſo as they haue not an abſolute power to doe with it what they will, but according to the directions of the great Lord and Maſter they muſt vſe it, reſerue it, and leaue it.
               For this end parents muſt order their manner of liuing according Direction. to that portion which the Lord hath appointed vnto them, and by his prouidence beſtowed vpon them; they muſt (as it is ſaid in the prouerbe) cut their coat according to their cloth. Of the two it is much better for parents to liue vnder, then aboue their meanes. Prouided that they neglect no duty of charitie, or iuſtice: nor through miſerableneſſe and niggardlineſſe carry themſelues vnbeſeeming the place wherein God hath ſet them, and eſtate which he hath beſtowed vpon them. He that liueth ſomewhat vnder his meanes, hath opportunitie to lay vp portions for other children (if he haue many) and to reſerue his inheritance intire to his eldeſt (beſide many other good workes of charity as God ſhall offer occaſion) which he that liueth aboue his meanes cannot doe.
            
            
               §. 65. Of the inconueniences which improuident parents bring their children vnto after their death.
               
               Contrary to this branch of a parents prouidence, are many courſes of improuident parents: For
               1. Some parents lauiſh and bezell out all their eſtate in their owne life time, making it to determine in their perſons. Vnworthy they are to receiue any inheritance from anceſtors. Their fault is double.
               1. In ſpending prodigally aboue their eſtate.
               2. In wronging their children, and depriuing them of their right: for particular perſons ſucceding one another are but as diuers linkes of a continued family, which are by Gods

prouidence added one to another: this chaine is not to be broken at any mans pleaſure; but for the preſeruation thereof, that which hath beene receiued of the predeceſſors, muſt be left to the ſucceſſors.
               2. Others leaue their eſtate to their children, but ſo incumbred with debts, bonds, recognizances, and ſtatutes, as their children were better be without it, then haue it. For the hauing it maketh them liue at an anſwerable rate, and bringeth many burdens vpon them: beſides, the debts wherein they ſtand obliged make them as 
                     Pro. 22. 7. 
                  ſeruants to their creditors: and in time they muſt be forced to ſell all, or as captiues lie in priſon.
               3. Others though they deale not ſo hardly with their children, yet they deale too hardly by peeling and polling their inheritance as much as they can: they wil not forbeare to make any preſent gaine that they can, though it tend neuer ſo much to the preiudice and dammage of their children after them: as they who cut downe all the timber and wood that they can, and take out all the heart of their land.
               4. Among theſe may be reckoned ſuch parents as by meere negligence ſuffer things to goe to decay for want of timely reparations: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that ſuch dammages as in the parents time might haue beene preuented with laying out a few ſhillings, cannot be renewed with many pounds.
               5. Such alſo as care not in their life time to cleere the titles of thoſe things which they leaue to their children: but leaue all things ſo vnſetled and litigious, as it oft coſts children more in ſuit of law to maintaine the inheritance which their parents leaue them, then the inheritance is worth: and yet after all their paines and coſt loſe the inheritance too: whereas the parent that knew more then the childe can, might with ſmall paines and charge haue well ſetled and cleered all.
               Theſe are miſchiefes that many children haue beene brought into by the improuidence of their parents: which are the rather to be made knowne, that ſuch as come after, may proue the more prouident for their children.
            
            
               
               §. 66. Of parents impartiall reſpect to all their children.
               
               Hitherto of parents duties. The perſons to whom thoſe duties are to be performed, are diſtinctly to be conſidered.
               The parties to whom parents are to performe all the forenamed duties are expreſſed vnder this word (Children) which 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . hath not any ſpeciall reſpect to prioritie of birth, to conſtitution of body, to affection of parent, or any ſuch thing, as if firſt borne, proper, beautifull, darling, or the like children were only meant, but all that are begotten and borne of parents, all their children are meant. Whence I obſerue, that Parents ought to haue an impartiall reſpect to all their children, and performe dutie indifferently and equally to all. We haue for proofe hereof Gods patterne, who accounteth all his children deare or beloued children. The Greeke word tranſlated 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Eph. 5. 1. 
                  deare is very emphaticall: it is properly attributed to an only childe: the ſeuentie that tranſlated the Hebrew Bible into Greeke, doe with this word interpret that phraſe, Only Sonne: 
                  
                     Gen. 22. 2. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Heſychius 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     exponit 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Plutarchus dicit 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     vocari 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . for where in Hebrew it is thus ſaid to Abraham, take thy ſonne, thine only one, they thus tranſlate it, take thy ſonne, thy deare one, or thy beloued one. Other Greeke authors doe ſo attribute the ſame word to an only childe, yea also and to an only eie: as when a man hath but one eie they call it a beloued eie. This word then ſheweth that God ſo reſpecteth all his children, as if all were but one, all a firſt-borne, all a darling childe. So rare a vertue this impartiall reſpect is (rare in the excellencie of it, rare alſo in the ſcarcitie of it) as thorowout the Scripture I can ſcarce finde a perfect patterne thereof 
                     Ariſt. Rhet. 1. vocat vnicum oculum 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . among the ſonnes of men. Many may be giuen of the contrary, as we ſhall after heare. But the more rare it is, the more we muſt labour after it, that ſo we may reſemble Gods fatherhood.
               1. All our children come from our owne ſubſtance and Reaſons. bowels. Why then ſhould we reſpect one childe aboue another, more then we doe one eie, or one eare aboue another? We are as tender ouer one as ouer another, though it may be we haue more vſe of one then of another.
               2. All our children are alike committed to vs by God: the ſame precepts and directions giuen for all alike: the like account to be giuen for all. If a King ſhould commit many of

his children to one nurſe, would not he be offended (and that iuſtly) if ſhe ſhould put ſuch a difference betwixt them, through a fooliſh partialitie, as to reſpect ſome, and neglect others?

                     Obiect. What if one childe be more pious to God and parent, another more rebellious, may not a parent reſpect that more then this?
                  
                  1. Anſw. He may take notice of their different carriage, and accordingly reward the one, and puniſh the other, and yet carrie an equall deſire of doing good to both of them alike: for the puniſhing of the rebellious childe is a parents dutie; an euidence of loue, and a meanes of doing him good.
                  2. Anſw. It is no partialitie to like grace and goodneſſe in a childe, and for grace and goodneſſe ſake to loue his childe ſo much the more, as alſo for impietie and obſtinacy in rebellion to haue his heart the more alienated from his childe: this is rather a vertue in a parent. Partialitie is when on by and vndue reſpects one childe is preferred before another.
               
            
            
               §. 68. Of the prerogatiue of the firſt-borne ſonne.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. May not a parent preferre his firſt-borne childe, and heire before his other children?
                  
                     Anſw. We muſt put difference betwixt a fathers diſpoſing his eſtate vpon his children, and the ordering of his affection towards them. A parents affection, and care of good education, and deſire of true good, and faithfull praiers to God, may be as great towards his younger children, as towards his eldeſt ſonne and heire, and yet may he beſtow the greateſt patrimony vpon the heire: which is no partialitie.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. Is it then iuſt and equall that the eldeſt ſonne ſhould haue a greater patrimony then any of the reſt?
                  
                     Anſw. It is moſt iuſt and equall. For
                  1. God hath ſo appointed it: yea 
                        Deut. 21. 17. he made this to be one of the prerogatiues of the firſt-borne, to haue a double portion. Vpon this ground 1 Chr. 5. 2. 
                     Ioſeph, who was the firſt-borne of the true wife, had a double portion; and as a teſtimony thereof his poſteritie made two tribes.
                  
                     
2. The lawes of all nations doe order as much.
                  3. Our law giueth the whole inheritance of freeholds to the eldeſt ſonne: in which reſpect it is due vnto him. For in ciuill and temporall matters this rule is true, we liue by law. I take it to be a matter of conſcience for a parent to leaue that to euery childe which by law is due to him. Neither is it without good reaſon that the law ordaineth that a parents whole eſtate of freehold land ſhould deſcend: for
                  1. There is an excellency in the firſt borne, as is euident by Iaakobs ſpeech to his eldeſt ſonne, 
                        Gen. 49. 3. 
                     thou art my firſt borne, my might, and the beginning of my ſtrength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power. And thereupon 
                        Exod. 13. 2. God tooke the firſt borne as peculiar to himſelfe.
                  2. Houſes and families by this meanes are vpheld and continued from age to age. How needfull it is for the eſtabliſhment of a commonwealth that families ſhould thus be continued, is euident both by experience to all ſuch as haue but halfe an eie to ſee wherein the ſtability of a common wealth conſiſteth, and alſo by the many lawes which God ordained among the Iewes for this purpoſe: as
                  1. That 
                        Leu. 25. 23. no land ſhould be quite cut off from a family.
                  2. That 
                        Verſ. 25. if any through pouerty were forced to ſell his land, the next of kin was to buy it.
                  3. That 
                        Verſ. 28. if a man that had ſold his land, could by no meanes redeeme it againe, at the yeere of Iubilee he was to haue the poſſeſſion of it againe.
                  4. That 
                        Num. 36. 8. if daughters were heires they ſhould not marry out of their fathers tribe: and this reaſon is giuen, that euery man may enioy the inheritance of his fathers.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. By leauing the whole inheritance to the eldeſt, he may be made a Gentleman, and all the other beggars.
                  
                     Anſw. In this reſpect parents ought to be ſo much the more prouident for their other children, in training them vp to callings, or laying vp portions, or ſetling other eſtates vpon them beſide the maine inheritance, or in taking order that comp
                     
                        •
                     ent portions be raiſed out of the inheritance of the eldeſt ſon, 
                        •
                     n caſe God take them away before they haue otherwiſe pro

                     ided for their children.
                  
                     
Out of this anſwer may a third reaſon be gathered, to ſhew that it is a behouefull law for the commonwealth that the heire ſhould haue all the land. For this law maketh parents more carefull in training vp their younger ſonnes to ſundry callings which are profitable to a commonwealth. If euery childe ſhould haue a part of his fathers lands, they would all ſo depend thereupon, as none of them would exerciſe themſelues to ſuch callings as are meanes of mens maintenance.
               
            
            
               §. 69. Of parents partiality towards ſome children.
               
               Contrary to the forenamed duty of a parents equall reſpect to all his children, is partiality in fathers and mothers, manifeſted ſundry waies. For
               1. Many parents haue their darling children, to whom ſo 
                     Iniquiſſima volucris aquila in educanda ſua prole dicitur eſſe. Pullorum enim alterum alis percuſſum abigit: alterum ſolum vti ſuum educat. Baſil. Hexaem. hom. 8. much affection is ſhewed, as in compariſon none is ſhewed to others. When ſome are hugged in the boſome, others are neglected as if they were none of their owne, but baſely borne. The vnnaturalneſſe of the eagle is noted in this kinde, that ſhe flaps and driues out of the neſt one of her young ones, and feedeth only the other as her owne. From ſuch partiality in parents proceed many miſchiefes: as theſe,
               1. They giue occaſion to ſuch as obſerue it, to ſuſpect that thoſe children who are ſo little reſpected, are none of their owne.
               2. They cauſe enuy, malice, and much contention to ariſe among children. When Ioſephs brethren ſaw that their father 
                  
                     Gen. 37. 4. 
                  loued him more then all them, they hated him, and could not ſpeake peaceably vnto him.
               
               3. They prouoke God to inflict ſome iudgement on thoſe children that are ſo cockered, and preferred before the reſt: that ſo they may the better ſee their folly.
               This ſinne of parents partiality is ſo much the greater, when vpon outward reſpects they preferre the wicked and vngodly children before pious and gracious children. Iſaak herein much failed, for 
                     Gen. 25. 28. 
                  he loued Eſau (a 
                     Heb. 12. 16. profane wretch) becauſe he did eat of his Veniſon.
               
               2. Other parents ſo ſet themſelues to raiſe their houſe, as a
                     •
                   their care is to aduance their eldeſt ſonne, by education, by liberall allowance, and by leauing all they haue to him: and i
                     •
                  
                  
the meane while neglect their younger children. Though (as was noted §. 68. before) the maine inheritance may iuſtly without ſhew of partiality be left to the heire, yet to be carefull only for him, and to neglect the other, ſauoureth ranke of partiality. It is moſt agreeable to naturall reaſon, that as life is giuen to all Conſentaneum eſt rationi naturae vt aequè tribuere cui

               3. In the number of partiall parents may they be reckoned, who vniuſtly diſinherit their firſt borne. For the inheritance of right belonging to them, and they not deſeruing to be diſinherited, aſſuredly it is ſome by reſpect or other which maketh parents prefer the younger before the elder: and this is plaine partiality. This kinde of partiality is commonly in ſuch parents as haue had children by ſeuerall wiues. Sometimes diſlike of a former wife maketh a father diſlike the children he hath by her, and through diſlike to diſinherit the heire by her. God gaue the Iewes an expreſſe law againſt this kinde of 
                     Deu. 21. 15. &c.
                   partiality.
               Sometimes againe a gripulous ſeeking of aduantage to themſelues maketh parents to diſinherit the right heire: as when a man after he hath buried the mother of his firſt borne, hearing of another woman which is of great wealth, maketh ſute for her. She refuſeth becauſe he hath an heire of a former wife. He to remoue that blocke entereth couenant to make the ſonne which he hath by her (if he haue any) his heire: hereupon the mariage is conſummate: his ſecond wife bringeth forth a ſonne: he for his couenant ſake diſinheriteth the firſt heire. An vniuſt, and vnlawfull practiſe.
            
            
               §. 70. Of the cauſes for which the firſt-borne may be diſinherited.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. May not then a firſt-borne ſonne be diſinherited?
                  
                     Anſw. Yes, The Scripture noteth two cauſes wherein the firſt-borne may be put from the inheritance.
                  1. If he be illegitimate: for ſuch an one hath no good title: The ſonne of the bondwoman ſhall not be heire with my ſonne, 
                     
                        Gen. 21. 10. ſaith Sarah, and that iuſtly. To like purpoſe ſay the ſons of Gileads wife to Iephthah, Thou ſhalt not inherit in our fathers houſe, 
                     
                        Iudg. 11. 2. 
                     for thou art the ſonne of a ſtrange woman. Iuſt was that blame which Iotham laid vpon the men of Shechem for making Abimelech

the baſe ſonne of Ierubbaal King: and iuſt was Gods vengeance vpon them for that wrong done to Ierubbaals legitimate children.
                  2. If he be notoriouſly wicked. Thus 
                        Gen. 49. 4. 1 Chro. 5. 1. 
                     Ruben for committing abominable inceſt loſt his birthright.

               §. 71. Of the dutie of fathers and mothers in law.
               
               The extent of this title (Fathers) is in the laſt place to be Who are in place of parents. conſidered. Not only naturall parents themſelues, but alſo all that are in their place are compriſed vnder it. As they who are in the place of parents,

                     1. By the bond of mariage.
                     2. By propinquity of bloud.
                     3. By voluntary appointment.
                  
               
               The firſt ſort are fathers and mothers in law: who are ſo reckoned either by the mariage of parents themſelues, or by the mariage of their children.
               That man or woman which is maried to a parent that had children before their mariage, is in the place of a naturall parent: thus Ioſeph was a 
                     Luke 2. 48. father to Ieſus, and 
                     Gen. 25. 1. 
                  Keturah a mother to Iſaak. So againe the naturall parents of that ſonne that hath maried a wife, or of that daughter that is maried to an husband, are in the place of parents to the wife of their ſonne, and to the husband of their daughter. Thus 
                     Exod. 18. 1. 
                  Iethro was a father to Moſes, and 
                     Ruth 3. 1. 
                  Naomi a mother to Ruth.
               
               All theſe are to account their children in law (that is, the Parents in law to performe like duties as naturall parents. children of their husband and wife, or the wiues of their ſons, and the husbands of their daughters) as their owne naturall children, and according to the age and place of theſe children to performe the forenamed duties, and euery way to ſeeke their good (except in ſuch duties as after a peculiar manner belong to naturall parents, as nurſing to a naturall mother, leauing the inheritance to a naturall parent.)
               For a patterne hereof take the forenamed examples of Ioſeph and Naomi. What naturall parents could doe more for their owne children then Ioſeph did for Ieſus, and Naomi for Ruth? The hiſtory noteth how Ioſeph tooke care to haue his wiues

childe 
                     Luk. 2. 21, 22. circumciſed, and preſented in the temple: how he 
                     Mat. 2. 14. fled from place to place to preſerue the childs life: how 
                     Luk. 2. 48. perplexed he was when he thought the childe was loſt: how he 
                     Uerſ. 51. trained him vp in his owne houſe. The hiſtory alſo noteth how 
                     Ruth 1. 22. 
                  Naomi brought Ruth her ſonnes wife into her own countrey, and retained her with her ſelfe, and 
                     & 2. 22. directed her whither to goe, and 
                     & 3. 1. what husband to haue, and 
                     & 4. 16. became a nurſe to her childe.
               1. Mariage maketh man and wife one fleſh: in which reſpect Reaſons. they ought to haue one minde, and the ſame affections, as mutually each to other, ſo ioyntly to the children of each other. On which ground alſo the husband and wife of a childe, being one fleſh with the childe, ought as the childe to be reſpected. On this ground God counteth the Saints his 
                     Eph. 5. 1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  deare children, becauſe they are 2 Cor. 11. 2. eſpouſed to his naturall ſon.
               2. To reſpect the children of an husband or wife as their owne, is a great euidence of intire loue to the husband and wife. And to reſpect the husband and wife of a childe is a great euidence of loue to the childe it ſelfe. If the worlds prouerbe hold true (loue me and loue my dog) how much more true is this Chriſtian rule, loue me and loue my childe: or loue me and loue mine husband: or loue me and loue my wife.
               
               3. This alſo is an eſpeciall meanes to kindle and preſerue mutuall loue betwixt man and wife, who haue children of former husbands and wiues: as alſo betwixt parents and children.
            
            
               §. 72. Of the peruerſe cariage of fathers and mothers in law to their children.
               
               Contrary is the cariage of moſt fathers and mothers in law: eſpecially of thoſe who are maried to husbands or to wiues that had children before mariage: ſo farre they are from performing the forenamed duty, as rather they enuy at the proſperity of their husbands and wiues children: and ſecretly endeuour to hinder it in what they can: and cunningly leeke to alienate the naturall parents affection from them: whence Senecae Hippolytus. fearefull tragedies haue beene made, and lamentable miſchiefes haue followed. What other reaſon can be giuen hereof 
                     Ouid. Metamorph. l. 15. ſab. 45. but a plaine inſtigation of the deuill, who thus laboureth to

diſunite thoſe whom God hath ioyned together? For auoiding this ſnare note the miſchiefes that follow from thence.
               1. Such parents ſinne againſt Gods ordinance: and as Eue, leane more to Satans ſuggeſtion then to Gods direction.
               2. They alienate the hearts and affections of one from another: not only from their children, but from themſelues.
               3. They prouoke their children in law to contemne and deſpiſe them, and to yeeld no duty vnto them.
               Hence note into what an hell vnkinde fathers and mothers in law doe caſt themſelues. If this were duly weighed, I thinke they would be otherwiſe minded. But the god of this world doth ſo blinde their eies with ſelfe-loue, and with enuy, that they cannot ſee the miſchiefes whereinto they implunge themſelues.
               This is a point the more to be weighed, becauſe the fault here taxed is ſo common, and hath in all ages beene too common.

               Many parents to the husbands and wiues of their children doe alſo much tranſgreſſe and ſwarue from their dutie: for
               1. They will ſhew much more reſpect to their owne children then to the children of their husbands or wiues: as by comming to their daughters when their husbands are abroad, and neuer but then: and ſending for their ſonnes to their houſe, but not for their wiues.
               2. In all differences they will take part with their owne children, though it be in the worſe part, and ſhew great partiality.
               3. They will oft giue very ill counſell: aduiſing their ſons

to keepe their wiues ſhort: aduiſing their daughters not to be too ſubiect to their husbands, yea priuily to purloine from their husbands.
               4. If they liue with their children, they will ſo prie into euery thing that their childrens husband or wife doth, and ſhew ſuch ſuſpicion and iealouſly in euery thing, as they cannot but cauſe much diſcord: and hence it oft commeth to paſſe, that either parent and childe, or husband and wife muſt be parted: they cannot all in peace liue together.
               Theſe faults I thus note, that they may the more carefully be auoided.

               The next ſort of thoſe who are in ſtead of parents, are thoſe who in bloud and kindred are next to parents: as grandfathers, grand-mothers, vncles, aunts, elder brothers, or ſiſters, their husbands or wiues, and coſins.
               Theſe commonly are counted to be in the place of parents, The next of kin to Orphants to be as naturall parents. when God taketh away naturall and immediate parents from their children: ſo as they are parents to Orphants.
               The duties which were preſcribed to naturall parents appertaine to them (except §. 71. before excepted.) Their dutie is to ſee theſe Orphants well educated, well placed in ſome good calling, well maried, and (if the Orphants be left deſtitute of meanes) well prouided for.
               
                  Mordecai is a worthy preſident and patterne for this kinde of parents. 
                     Eſt. 2. 7. 
                  He brought vp Eſther his vncles daughter (for ſhe had neither father nor mother) he tooke her for his owne daughter: when ſhe was taken from him, 
                     Verſ. 11. 
                  he went to know how ſhe did, and what ſhould become of her: and 
                     Verſ. 20, 22. Chap. 4. verſ. 13. he gaue her aduice from time to time how to carrie her ſelfe. Let ſuch as are parents to Orphants take this example as a direction, and as a motiue to performe the other duties preſcribed to naturall parents as need requireth, and occaſion is offered.
               God by his prouidence taking away naturall parents committeth their Orphants as a charge to the next of kin: that as their naturall parents brought them forth, theſe ſhould bring them vp: therefore for their recompence let them looke to God, (who taketh vpon himſelfe to be 
                     Pſal. 68. 5. a father of the fatherleſſe)

and for their incouragement remember the reward which Mordecai receiued of the Lord: yea alſo let them remember the bleſſing that God beſtowed vpon Eſther. God doth oft ſo bleſſe the meanes vſed for the education of Orphants, as they who take the care thereof haue no cauſe to repent their paines and coſt, but rather haue much matter of comfort, ioy and thankſgiuing.
            
            
               §. 75. Of the common neglect of Orphants.
               
               Too too common is the contrary diſpoſition of moſt kinſmen, and kinſwomen; they thinke they are bound to none but their owne children, and if they haue no children, to none at all. Many are of Ruths kinſmans minde, they feare to marre 
                  
                     Ruth 4. 6. 
                  their owne inheritance. Though they be themſelues exceeding rich, and ſpend much in apparell, paſtimes and houſe-keeping, yet they can ſuffer the Orphants of their poore kindred to want, and to beg for need.
               This is it that maketh the loſſe of naturall parents to be ſo much the greater. And herein many Chriſtians are more inhumane then the heathen: which the Apoſtle implieth, where he faith, they are worſe then infidels: for Orphants next of kinne 1 Tim. 5. 8. are to be reckoned among thoſe whom the Apoſtle termeth a mans

               §. 76. Of the dutie of Guardians.
               
               The laſt ſort of thoſe who are in place of parents, are ſuch as haue the charge of children committed to them by voluntary appointment of parents, or are choſen by children themſelues, or by the magiſtrate when parents are dead, or lunatike, or any other way impotent, and vnable to traine vp their owne children.
               Of theſe care and conſcience is rather required, then coſt and charges: for commonly both their charges are allowed, and their paines recompenced.
               They who by reaſon of the death or impotency of naturall parents haue the charge of children committed to them, are commonly called Guardians: of whom two generall duties are required.
               
                  1. That they looke to their Pupils good education.
                  2. That they preſerue their patrimony and inheritance.
               
               
                  
For their education, the directions giuen before to naturall parents are to be obſerued by them.
               For preſeruation of their patrimonie, they muſt doe for their Pupils what they would doe for their owne children; and ſo carry themſelues, as with good conſcience they may giue that account to their Pupils, or any other, which the law requireth.
               The two forenamed duties, are the rhaine ends for which Guardians are choſen: in performing whereof, if they be faithfull, great redreſſe will be made of the vntimely death of parents; and notwithſtanding parents die before their children be of diſcretion to manage their eſtate, yet will their houſes and families be maintained, and young heires kept from cunnie-catchers and cheaters.
               It is noted of Iohn, who had the mother of Ieſus commended 
                     Ioh. 19. 27. to him, that he tooke her to his owne home: whereby is implied his prouident care for her good.
            
            
               §. 77. Of the fraud of Guardians.
               
               Contrary is the practiſe of moſt Guardians, who take Pupils 
                     Tutela ad vtilitatem eorum qui commiſſi ſunt, non ad corum quibus commiſſa, gerenda eſt. Cic. Offic. l. 1. for their owne aduantage, and make a prey of them. The heathen could ſay, that Guardianſhip is to be performed for the benefit of the Pupill, and not of the Guardian. Yet among Chriſtians is the forenamed fault of Guardians.
               1. There are few children (that haue not naturall parents to looke to their good education) but are exceedingly neglected therein, and brought vp very rudely and licentiouſly: yea many times too ſparingly and 
                     •
                  iggardly for diet, apparell, and other needfull things, though they haue ſufficient to diſcharge all that ſhall be laid out vpon them.
               2. The maine eſtate & patrimonie of many Pupils is much impaired: and if they haue lands, as much waſte is made vpon them as poſſibly can be: and when a reckoning is to be giuen, it ſhall be a large, vniuſt, and moſt vnconſcionable reckoning of the Guardian can but get a generall releaſe, it is all that the caueth for.
               3. Mariages are after a for forced vpon many Pupils: and ſuch matches put vpon them as they cannot like; yea ſuch as are no way fit for them, neither for eſtate, nor yeeres, nor proportion of bodie, nor qualities of minde.
               Little doe theſe Guardians thinke of that account where unto they ſhall be brought an other day before the Lord, who ſtileth

himſelfe the 
                     Pſal. 10. 14. 
                  helper of the fatherleſſe, and who beholdeth miſchiefe to requite it. Fearefull is that iudgement which the Lord hath 
                     Exo. 22. 22, &c.
                   threatned againſt thoſe that oppreſſe the fatherleſſe. Let not therefore vniuſt Guardians thinke, that the gaine they get wrongfully from their Pupils ſhall proſper: but rather let them looke for Gods curſe vpon their owne children, and goods.
               If ſuch as parents themſelues haue vpon their death-beds committed their children vnto, in confidence of their faithfulneſſe, ſhall deale deceitfully with their Pupils, their ſinne is doubled, and trebled. For

                     1. They violate the bond of friendſhip, faithfulneſſe, and truſt repoſed vpon them.
                     2. They ſinne directly againſt iuſtice.
                     3. Moſt monſtrouſly they tranſgreſſe the rules of charitie.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 78. Of the dutie of Schoolemaſters and Tutors.
               
               Among thoſe who are by voluntarie appointment ſet in the place of parents, are Schoolemaſters and Tutors to be reckoned. The authoritie and charge of a parent is for a time committed to them: therefore for that time they ought to performe a parents dutie.
               Their dutie is appropriated to education: it appertaineth not to them to maintaine the children committed to them: they are rather themſelues by their paines that way maintained.
               All the duties which were before compriſed vnder nurture, belong to Schoolemaſters and Tutors. More particularly they are to inſtruct children in three things.

                     1. In learning.
                     2. In ciuilitie, and good manners.
                     3. In true pietie, and religion.
                  
               
               I ſhall not need to ſpeake more of theſe points then hath §. 28, 34. before beene deliuered: only to prouoke them to be diligent in well nurturing children in thoſe three points, let the benefit of good Schoolemaſters and Tutors be well noted.
               Schoolemaſters commonly caſt the firſt ſeed into the hearts of The benefit of a good Schoolmaſter. children: they firſt ſeaſon them: as the ſeed is, ſuch will the crop be: as the firſt ſeaſoning is, ſo will the ſauour continue to be. If they ſowe no good ſeed at all, what harueſt can be looked for? If they ſowe a corrupt ſeed of rudeneſſe, licentiouſneſſe, profaneneſſe,

ſuperſtition, and any wickedneſſe, the crop muſt needs be anſwerable thereto. But if they ſowe the good ſeed of learning, ciuilitie, and pietie, there is great hope of a good crop.
               Hence it followeth that they are of great vſe, and may bring much good, not only to the children themſelues, and their parents,

Iulian the Apoſtat was not ignorant hereof: and therefore endeuouring to root Chriſtianitie out of the world, he ſuffered no man that profeſſed himſelfe a Chriſtian, to teach a ſchoole: but in ſtead of Chriſtian Schoolemaſters, he ſet vp in euery part of his dominions, heatheniſh Schoolemaſters.
               Tutors, to whoſe gouernment young ſchollers, that are ſent to the Vniuerſities, are committed, haue to deale with children in their riper yeeres; euen when the time of ſetling them in a courſe is come: the very time wherein much good may be done to children, or elſe wherein they may be vtterly peruerted. There will be little hope of bowing them, and drawing them into another courſe after they be freed from the gouernment of a Tutor. Tutors therefore, as they haue need of great wiſdome, ſo of good conſcience, that they may haue the greater care of their Pupils, and take the greater paines in teaching them the three forenamed points, learning, ciuilitie, and pietie. A good Tutor may doe much to repaire the negligence, and amend the defects of a Schoolemaſter: but there remaine none to redreſſe the failings of a Tutor: children for the moſt part are paſt redreſſing, when they ceaſe to haue a Tutor.
            
            
               §. 79. Of the negligence of Schoolemaſters and Tutors.
               
               The vices contrary to the forenamed dutie of Schoolemaſters, are theſe.
               1. Unskilfulneſſe. Many that are more fit to be taught then to teach, take vpon them this weightie calling. Some haue not ſufficient learning: ſome againe are rude, and know not themſelues good manners: and ſome know not the firſt principles of the oracles of God. No good can be expected from theſe.
               2. Couetouſneſſe. All that many ſeeke, is to multiply the number of their ſchollers, and to get as much as they can for boording, and teaching: they aime more at their owne gaine then at their ſchollers profit. Children are not like to thriue well vnder them.
               
                  
3. Negligence. Many are loth to take the paines of a Schoolemaſter, and thereupon come as little into the ſchoole as they can: take euery ſmall occaſion to be gone againe: care not how much their children play: if they be able to hire a poore Vſher, all the burden ſhall be caſt vpon him. Little is that fruit that can be looked for from them.
               4. Want of pietie. Many skilfull and painfull Schoolemaſters, vnder whoſe teaching children come forward exceeding well in learning, thinke it nothing appertaineth to them to teach the grounds of religion, ſo as they altogether neglect pietie. Aſſuredly they want it themſelues: for were their owne hearts ſeaſoned with true pietie, their conſciences would moue them to teach it to their children. The things of the kingdome of God are like vnto 
                     
                        •
                     eauen, which ſeaſoneth the whole batch of dough with that ſeaſon and ſauour which it ſelfe hath. When children ſpend almoſt all their time with their Schoolemaſters, of whom ſhould they learne it, if not of them? What bleſſing can be hoped from the paines of ſuch Schoolemaſters?
               I might to theſe adde the ouer-much remiſneſſe of ſome (whereby children get too great an head) and the too great ſeueritie of others, either in frequencie of correcting, as if they delighted therein; or in the meaſure thereof, as if they had to doe with beaſts, whereby they affright children, make them dull, yea and impudent alſo. But theſe extremes were §. 48, 49. before handled.
               The common fault of Tutors is altogether to neglect their Pupils. Many thinke a Tutor to be a meeretitular matter: no more to be required of them but to beare the very name; and to vndertake that the Colledge be diſcharged for their Pupils diet. This conceit, and the practiſe anſwerable thereunto, is the blemiſh and bane of the Vniuerſities. Many children well trained vp in ſchooles, vtterly loſe the benefit of all their former education when they are ſent to the Vniuerſitie, becauſe their Tutors altogether leaue them to themſelues: and ſo they are made a prey to idle and lewd companions. By reaſon hereof many parents are vtterly diſcouraged to ſend their children to the Vniuerſitie.

                           Expreſſed.
                        
                         
                     
                  
               
               They are implied three waies.

                     
                        1. By declaring the place of a Maſter (as to Chriſt.)
                     
                     
                        2. By noting out the honour of their ſeruice (as ſeruants of Chriſt.)
                     
                     
                        3. By ſhewing the ground of ſeruants ſubiection (Gods will.)
                     
                  
               
               The motiue expreſſed is the Recompence which ſeruans ſhall haue for their paines largely laid forth, verſ. 8.
               Therein theſe diſtinct points are noted in order.

                     
                        1. The aſſurance thereof (knowing.)
                     
                     
                        2. The ground thereof, taken from a generall rule (whatſoeuer good thing any man doth.)
                     
                     
                        
                        3. The particular application thereof (whether bond or free.)
                     
                     
                        4. The kinde thereof (the ſame ſhall he receiue.)
                     
                     
                        5. The author and giuer thereof (of the Lord.)
                     
                  
               
            
            
               §. 2. Of the lawfulneſſe of a maſters place and power.
               
               In handling ſeruants duties I will proceed according to the order propounded. In the firſt place therefore I will note out the kindes of ſeruants duties.
               For finding out the kindes, I will obſerue the method followed in handling childrens duties. Note then

                     
                        1. The Fountaine of ſeruants duties.
                     
                        2. The Streames that iſſue from thence.
                  
               
               The Fountaine reſteth partly in the opinion, and partly in the affection of ſeruants.
               In their Opinion they muſt be informed and reſolued that the Seruants muſt be informed of the lawfulneſſe of a maſters authoritie. place of a maſter and a ſeruant is lawfull and warrantable: that God ingenerall ordained degrees of ſuperioritie and inferioritie, of authority and ſubiection: and in particular gaue to maſters the authoritie which they haue, and put ſeruants in that ſubiection wherein they are. Till the iudgement be reſolued hereof, nor reuerence, nor obedience will be yeelded as it ought. For Reuerence hath reference to Eminencie and ſuperioritie: and Obedience to Authoritie and power. Who will reuerence or obey him whom he taketh to be his equall? This was the ground of the conſpiracie of Corah, Dathan and Abiram, that they thought 
                     Numb. 16. 3. 
                  Moſes and Aaron tooke too much vpon them, and lift themſelues vp aboue the congregation of the Lord. Wherefore I will here note the grounds of a maſters authoritie, and ſeruants ſubiection. Grounds of maſters and ſeruants places.
               
               1. God hath giuen expreſſe commandement vnto maſters to gouerne their ſeruants: and vnto ſeruants to be ſubiect to their maſters. 
                     Exo. 20. 10. In the fourth commandement God giueth a charge to maſters ouer their ſeruants, to ſee that they doe no manner of worke. And the Angell biddeth Hagar 
                  
                     Gen. 16. 9. 
                  humble her ſelfe vnder her miſtreſſe hands. And here ſeruants are commanded to obey their maſters.
               
               2. Many directions are giuen both to maſters and ſeruants in regard of their different places how to carry themſelues one

to another. Read for this purpoſe the many lawes which Moſes preſcribed to both: the many counſels which Solomon, in his prouerbs eſpecially, giueth alſo to both: and particularly the directions of this and other Apoſtles.
               3. Saints in all ages haue beene ſet in theſe places: ſome in the places of maſters, and ſome in the places of ſeruants: and according to the place wherein God hath ſet them, they haue performed their dutie: maſters the duties of maſters, and ſeruants the duties of ſeruants.
               4. The many parables which Chriſt vſeth taken from the power which maſters haue and exerciſe ouer their ſeruants, and the ſubiection which ſeruants yeeld to their maſters, ſhew that the authoritie of the one, and ſubiection of the other, are things without queſtion granted and not denied.
               5. God hath made many promiſes of reward both to maſters, and ſeruants, that conſcionably performe the duties of their place: and hath made many threatnings againſt the one and the other that are negligent therein.
               All theſe grounds are ſo cleerely and plentifully noted in the Scripture, that any one who is any whit acquainted therewith may know them to be ſo. Were there no other arguments then this text which I haue in hand, it were enough to confound all gainſaiers: and to moue ſuch as beleeue the rather 
                     Serui cum crediderint plus dominis carnalibus ſeruire debent. Cypr. Teſtim. l. 3. c. 72 See Treat. 1. §. 123. for their faith and profeſſion ſake to ſerue their maſters after the fleſh.
            
            
               §. 3 Of the Anabaptiſts arguments againſt the authoritie of maſters, and ſubiection of ſeruants.
               
               Contrary to this firſt ground of ſeruants ſubiection is the opinion of Anabaptiſts, who teach that all are alike, and that there is no difference betwixt maſters and ſeruants. Their reaſons, whereby they would make ſhew to proue their vnreaſonable opinion, are theſe.
               
                  1. Obiect. Maſters are either Infidels or Chriſtians, and ſo ſeruants either one or other. If maſters be Infidels, and ſeruants Chriſtians, how vnmeet is it that Chriſtians ſhould be ſubiect to Infidels? and if maſter and ſeruant be both Chriſtians, they are brothers: but brothers are equalls, and neither ſubiect to other.
                  
                     
                     Anſw. Rule and ſubiection are matters of outward policy, they tend to the outward preſeruation of Church, Commonwealth, and family, in this world: but faith, piety, and ſuch graces are inward matters of the ſoule, tending to a better life.
                  Theſe being thus different, one that is more excellent in the one, may be inferiour in the other. Yea though there be an equality in the one, namely, in ſpirituall things, yet there may be a diſparity in the other, namely, in ciuill and temporall matters. And though Saints may be farre inferiour to infidels in outward eſtate, yet they are not a whit the leſſe glorious before God. The honour proper and peculiar to Saints is inward, not viſible to the carnall eye of a naturall man.
               
               
                  2. Obiect. It is againſt nature for one to be ſeruant, eſpecially a bond-ſeruant to another. 
                        Prima ſeruitutis cauſa peccatum eſt, &c. Verum & poenalis ſeruitus ea lege ordinatur, qua naturalem ordinem conſeruari iubet, &c. Aug. de Ciu. Dei l. 19. c. 15.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. To grant that it is againſt that abſolute and perfect nature wherein at firſt God created man, and that it came in by ſinne, yet is it not againſt that order and courſe of nature wherein God hath now ſetled man. God hath turned many puniſhments of ſinne to be bounden duties; as ſubiection of wife to husband, and mans eating bread in the ſweat of his brow.
                  
               
               
                  3. Obiect. It is the prerogatiue of Chriſtians to be 
                        Gal. 3. 28. 
                     all one: but ſubiection of ſeruants to maſters is againſt that prerogatiue.
                  
                     Anſw. That prerogatiue is meerely ſpirituall: for in Chriſt all are one, as they are members of Chriſt, which is a ſpirituall body: not as they are members of a politique body. A politipue inequality is not againſt a ſpirituall equality.
               
               
                  4. Obiect. This ſubiection is againſt the 
                        Gal. 5. 1. liberty that Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs, and wherewith he hath made vs free.
                  
                     Anſw. It is not. For that liberty is from the curſe and rigor of the morall law: from the ceremoniall law and the rites thereof: from Satan, ſinne, death, and damnation: but not from thoſe degrees which God hath eſtabliſhed betwixt man and man, for the good of mankinde.
               
               
                  5. Obiect. We are expreſly forbidden to be 1 Cor. 7. 23. 
                     ſeruants of men.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. To be a ſeruant in that place is not ſimply to be in ſubiection See Treat. 1. §. 124, 125, 126. vnder another, and to doe ſeruice vnto him, but to be

ſo obſequious to a man, ſo addicted to pleaſe him, and ſo ſubiect to his will, as to doe whatſoeuer he will haue done: to regard nothing but his pleaſure: to prefer it before Gods word and will. It is not therefore the thing it ſelfe, but an exceſſe therein which is there forbidden.
               
            
            
               §. 4. Of a ſeruants feare of his maſter.
               
               The other part of that fountaine, from whence the duties Seruants ought to feare their maſters. of ſeruants flow, reſteth in the affection: and it is in one word Feare: which is an awfull dread of a maſter. An awe in regard of his maſters place: a dread in regard of his maſters power. An awe is ſuch a reuerend eſteeme of his maſter, as maketh him account his maſter worthy of all honour: which 1 Tim. 6. 1. 
                  S. Paul expreſly inioyneth ſeruants to doe. A dread is ſuch a feare of prouoking his maſters wrath, as maketh him thinke and caſt euery way how to pleaſe him. This is it which the Apoſtle here intimateth vnder theſe two words, feare and trembling. In both theſe reſpects S. Peter commandeth ſeruants to be ſubiect in al feare. 
                  1 Pet. 2. 18.
               
               So proper is this feare to a ſeruant in relation to his maſter, as where it is wanting, there is a plaine deniall of his maſters place and power; which God intimateth vnder this expoſtulation, If I be a maſter, where is my feare? that is, you plainely 
                     Mal. 1. 6. ſhew that you account me not your maſter, becauſe in your heart there is no feare of me.
               This feare will draw ſeruants on, cheerefully to performe all duty: the more it aboundeth, the more deſire and endeuour there will be to pleaſe, and to giue good contentment (and this is a point commanded to ſeruants, to pleaſe well in all things:) 
                  
                     Tit. 2. 9. yea it will glad the heart of a ſeruant to ſee his ſeruice proſper well: hereof we haue a worthy patterne in Abrahams ſeruant, 
                     Gen. 24. whoſe care to doe his buſineſſe, as his maſter would haue it, and prayer for Gods aſſiſtance therein, and thanks for Gods bleſſing thereon, ſheweth an awefull reſpect which he bare to his maſter.
               Againe, on the other ſide, this feare will keepe men from of fending their maſters (which was one reaſon that moued Ioſeph not to yeeld to his miſtreſſe) and in this reſpect it may

                     Gen. 39. 8.
                  
preuent many miſchiefes which their maſters offence and wrath might bring vpon them.
               One eſpeciall meanes to breed and preſerue this feare in ſeruants, is, a due conſideration of the ground of their maſters Direction. place and power: which is Gods appointment: God hath placed them in his ſtead, and in part giuen them his power: they are the Deputies and Miniſters of God, and therefore in Scripture the title (

                  Lord) is after a peculiar manner giuen to them. What maketh ſubiects ſtand in awe of inferiour Magiſtrates? Is it not becauſe they beare the Kings perſon, and haue authority and power giuen vnto them of the King?
            
            
               §. 5. Of the extremes contrary to ſeruants feare of their maſters.
               
               Two extremes are contrary to this ſeruant-like feare.
               1. In the exceſſe a ſlauiſh feare: when they feare nothing but Slauiſh feare in ſeruants. the reuenging power of their maſter: the ſtaffe or the cudgell, as we ſpeake: ſo they may auoid that, they care not whither their maſter be pleaſed or no. This maketh them oft to wiſh that their maſters had no power ouer them: or that they were dead. This was that feare which poſſeſſed the heart of that vnprofitable ſeruant, who ſaid to his maſter, I knew thee that 
                  
                     Mat. 25. 24, 25. 
                  thou art an hard man, and I was afraid. Such ſeruile ſeruants will neuer be profitable.
               2. In the defect, a light eſteeme and plaine contempt of Seruants deſpiſing their maſters. Mal. 1. 6. maſters. That this is contrary to feare is euident by that oppoſition which God maketh betwixt them in theſe words, If I be a maſter, where is my feare, ô ye that deſpiſe my name? As if he had ſaid; Hereby ye ſhew that ye feare me not as a maſter, becauſe ye deſpiſe me. This ſinne of deſpiſing maſters is expreſly 1 Tim. 6. 2. forbidden: and for it was 
                     Gen. 16. 6. 
                  Hagar dealt hardly withall. When maſters are poore, meane, weake, aged, or otherwiſe impotent, then proud ſeruants are prone to deſpiſe them: which argueth a baſe minde, ſhewing that they reſpect their maſters power more then his place: the pooreſt and weakeſt haue the ſame place and authority ouer ſeruants, that the richeſt and ſtrongeſt haue; all beare Gods image alike: but diſdainfull proud ſeruants ſhew that they regard not Gods image at all.
            
            
               
               §. 6. Of ſeruants reuerence in ſpeech.

               Seruants reuerence in refraining ſpeech is manifeſted 3. waies.
               1. By ſparing to ſpeake, without iuſt cauſe in their maſters preſence or audience: This phraſe (1 King. 10. 8. 
                  they ſtand continually before thee and heare thy wiſdome) ſpoken of Salomons ſeruants, ſheweth that they were ſlow to ſpeake and ſwift to heare in their maſters preſence.
               2. By forbearing to reply when they obſerue their maſters vnwilling that they ſhould ſpeake any more. Thus did Peter forbeare when his maſter gaue him this ſhort anſwer, 
                     Iohn 21. 22. 
                  What is that to thee?
               
               3. By attending to that which their maſters ſhall deliuer to them: for ſeruants ought to ſhew ſuch a reſpect to their maſters ſpeaking to them, as Samuel did to God, when he ſaid, 1 Sam. 3. 10. 
                  Speake for thy ſeruant heareth. The titles of Lord and Seruant doe ſhew, that this ſpeech is taken from the duty of ſeruants. The notation of the 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . See Treat. 1. §. 96, 124. Greeke word vſed by the Apoſtle, & tranſlated Obey, implieth as much. This reuerence did Abrahams 
                  
                     Gen. 24. 9. ſeruant ſhew to his maſter, when he gaue him a charge about chooſing a wife for his ſon.
               Seruants for well ordering their ſpeech vnto their maſters muſt obſerue fiue cautions.
               1. That they haue iuſt occaſion to ſpeake: and that is either when their maſters require them to ſpeake (as 
                     Mat. 16. 14. the diſciples) or when they ſee it behouefull for their maſters that they ſhould ſpeake. In ſuch caſes ſpeech argueth reuerence, as well as ſilence in other caſes. The generall points which were before deliuered of the reuerence of Treat. 3. §. 13. wiues to their husbands, and of Treat. 5. §. 4. 5. &c.
                   children to their parents, may be applied to ſeruants: and preſſed vpon them as an argument from the leſſe to the greater thus, If wiues (who in many things haue a ioynt authority with their husbands) & children (who are not in ſo ſeruile a degree ſubiect to their parents, as ſeruants to their maſters) muſt manifeſt their inward feare of their huſbands and parents by outward reuerence, much more muſt ſeruants to their maſters. To declare the force of this conſequence ſo much the more, let it be noted that the Apoſtle addeth another kind When behouefull for ſeruants to ſpeake to maſters. of word here, then he did before, either in wiues or childrens duties, namely See Treat. 1. §. 124. 
                  trembling.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Queſt. In what caſes may it be behouefull for maſters that their ſeruants ſpeake to them?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. When they know any thing that may be profitable for their maſters, they ought to declare it, though they be not asked: as 2 King. 5. 3. that maide which told her miſtreſſe Naamans wife, that there was a Prophet in Samaria that could deliuer him of his leproſie.
                  2. When maſters through ignorance, paſſion, or ſuch like cauſe, refuſe to doe that which their ſeruants know to be good for them, they ought to perſwade their maſters to doe it; as Naamans ſeruants perſwaded their maſter to waſh himſelfe in 2 King. 5. 13. Iordan as the Prophet aduiſed him.
                  3. When ſeruants are not fully inſtructed in thoſe things which they ought to doe for their maſter, they ought to aske of him what is to be done, as the diſciples who ſaid to their maſter, where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the 
                     
                        Mat. 26. 17. 
                     paſſeouer?
                  
                  4. When ſome ſcruple ariſeth in their minds about any charge that their maſter ſhall giue them, they may inquire of their maſter, as Abrahams ſeruant when he ſaid, what if the woman 
                     
                        Gen. 24. 5. 
                     will not come with me?
                  
                  5. When their maſter vniuſtly ſuſpecteth any euill of them, they may ſpeake to cleere their owne innocency, as Dauid 
                     1 Sam. 24. 10. did to Saul.
                  
                  A ſecond caution for ſeruants well ordering their ſpeech is, Directions for ſeruants well framing their ſpeech to maſters.
                  
                  That the very forme and manner of their ſpeech when they haue iuſt occaſion to ſpeake to their maſters, doe ſauour of reuerence: for which purpoſe let theſe particulars be noted.
                  1. That ſeruants giue reuerend titles to their maſters.
                  It was in an honourable reſpect of their maſter that the ſeruants

of Naaman, called him Father. In Scripture §. 4. one of 2 King. 5. 13. Gods titles is attributed to maſters, as Lord.
                  
                  2. That their words be few, no more then muſt needs, euen when they haue occaſion to ſpeake: as may be gathered out of the forenamed examples alleaged to ſhew when ſeruants might and ought to ſpeake.
                  3. That all their words ſpoken to their maſter be meeke, milde and humble: note for this purpoſe how the children of the Prophets framed their ſpeech to their maſter. 2 King. 6. 2. &c.
                     
                  
                  1. They humbly beg leaue for themſelues to goe to Iorden.
                  2. They intreat him to goe, in theſe words, vouchſafe I pray thee to goe with thy ſeruants.
                  
                  3. When one of them had loſt the head of his hatchet, as if he durſt not be ſo bold as to ſpeake to his maſter to get it him againe, he referreth the thing to his good pleaſure, ſaying, Alas maſter it was but borrowed.
                  
                  A third caution is,
                  That they obſerue a fit ſeaſon to ſpeake to their maſter: as when he is at leaſure to heare them: (thus it is noted of the diſciples that when their maſter was alone they propounded their queſtions vnto him) or when his minde is quiet, not 
                        Mar. 4. 10. troubled with paſſion (thus when Dauid obſerued that Sauls minde was ſomewhat pacified towards him, by that ſpeech he vſed, Is this thy voice my ſonne Dauid, then he tooke occaſion more freely to ſpeake to him.) 1 Sam. 26. 17.
                  
                  A fourth caution is,
                  That they giue a ready and preſent anſwer to their maſter. This is oft commended in Peter, that when Chriſt propounded any queſtion to his diſciples, he would preſently and 
                        Mat. 16. 16. Ioh. 6. 68. readily anſwer.
                  A fift caution is,
                  That all their ſpeeches and anſwers to their maſter be true, not daring to tell a lie vnto them: this argueth a very reuerend reſpect of a maſter. When Eli demanded of Samuel what the Lord had ſaid to him, Samuel told him euery whit and hid nothing from him. And when Dauid bid the woman of Tekoah 1 Sam. 3. 18. 2 Sam. 14. 18, 19. not to hide the thing that he ſhould aske her from him,

ſhe told him the whole truth. There is a double bond to tie ſeruants hereunto.
                  
                     1. Their conſcience towards God, who is a God of truth.
                     2. Their reſpect to their maſters with whom they ought to deale faithfully.
                  
                  Laſtly, a ſeruants reuerence ought to be manifeſted by his ſpeech of his maſter euen behinde his backe: ſpeaking good of him, and no euill: this part of reuerence alſo did Abrahams ſeruant ſhew to his maſter. Thus ſhall they ſhew themſelues 
                        Gen. 24. 35, &c.
                      good, true-hearted, faithfull ſeruants, and not paraſites.
               
            
            
               §. 7. Of the vices contrary to a ſeruants reuerence in ſpeech.
               
               Offences contrary to the forenamed Reuerence of ſeruants to their maſters are theſe.
               1. Sawcineſſe and boldneſſe in ſeruants when they haue no more reſpect to their maſters preſence then to any others, but are full of prate, and loud in ſpeech before their maſter, or in the roome next to him, where they may be heard as well as if they were in the ſame roome: much offence is thus oft times giuen to maſters.
               2. Importunity in ſpeaking, and replying againe and againe, though their maſters doe not only ſhew their diſlike thereof, but alſo expreſly charge them to ſpeake no more. Scolding maids that will haue the laſt words of their miſtreſſe much offend herein. This is directly againſt the Apoſtles prohibition to ſeruants, that they anſwer not againe. 
                  
                     Tit. 2. 9.
               
               3. Impatiency, when they cannot endure to heare their maſter make an end of his ſpeech, but either they will interrupt him, or fling away.
               4. Stoutneſſe, when (as Solomon noteth) though they vnderſtand, 
                  
                     Pro. 29. 19. 
                  they will not ſpeake: though they know very well that it is their maſters pleaſure they ſhould ſpeake, yea though they are bidden to ſpeake, yet their ſtout ſtomach, and ſullen heart will not ſuffer them to ſpeake: no though it be neuer ſo behouefull for their maſters: if they know that their maſter goeth on in a courſe very preiudiciall to him, yet will not they tell him of it: nay if their maſter vniuſtly ſuſpect any euill of them, they will let him abide in that iealouſly rather then ſpeake to cleare themſelues: and if their maſter doe not expreſly

appoint them from time to time what to doe, they will neuer aske: nor if they be doubtfull of that which he giueth them in charge, will they further inquire to be reſolued thereof. This kinde of ſilence, in theſe and ſuch like caſes, argueth more doggedneſſe then dutifulneſſe.
               5. Diſdaine, when they See §. 5. ſcorne to giue the title Maſter to him that is ſet ouer them, becauſe he is a poore and meane man.
               6. Arrogancy, when their words are high and lofty againſt their maſter, pretending that they are as good as he, though for a time they be vnder him. Clerkes, prentiſes, waiting women, and ſuch like, being borne of gentlemen, and men of good degree, are for the moſt part guilty of this fault: the reaſon is, becauſe their birth and parentage maketh them forget their preſent place and condition; or elſe (which is worſe) maketh them wilfully preſume aboue it.
               7. Muttering and murmuring vpon euery occaſion of diſcontent: whereby it commeth to paſſe that they oft prouoke much wrath (for grieuous words ſtirre vp anger.) 
                  
                     Pro. 15. 1.
               
               8. Vnſeaſonable interruption of their maſter: ſpeaking to him when he is ſeriouſly occupied in ſome weighty buſineſſe (as they who told Chriſt of his mother and brethren when he was preaching) or vnſeaſonably ſpeaking vnto him while he 
                     Mar. 3. 32. is in paſſion, whereby they oft bring much miſchiefe vpon themſelues.
               9. Anſwering their maſter at their owne leiſure, ſuffering him to call, and call againe and againe. This doth Iob complaine of, ſaying, I called my ſeruant and he gaue me no anſwer. 
                  
                     Iob 19. 16.
               
               10. Flapping their maſter in the mouth with a lie: like Gehazi, who, when he had lewdly fetched money and apparell of Naaman, and his maſter asked him where he had beene, ſaid with a faire face, Thy ſeruant went no whither. Let the iudgement 2 King. 5. 25. executed on him make all ſeruants take heed of the like ſinne. For Lying is in it ſelfe an hainous ſinne: yet ſo much the more hainous when it is told to one that hath authority ouer vs, and by reaſon thereof ſtandeth in Gods place.
               Laſtly, Euill language of their maſter behinde his backe. This is a ſinne, though that which is ſpoken to a maſters diſgrace

be true: for the infirmities of a maſter ought rather to be couered, then reuealed and laid open by a ſeruant. How monſtrous a ſinne is it then, to raiſe ſlanderous reports againſt a maſter which are vntrue? This was Zibas ſinne againſt Mephiboſheth his maſter. 2 Sam. 16. 3.
               
               Hitherto of ſeruants Reuerence in ſpeech to their maſters.
               Their Reuerence in cariage followeth.
            
            
               §. 8. Of ſeruants reuerend behauiour to their maſters.
               
               For manifeſtation of a ſeruants reuerence in cariage towards his maſter, three things are eſpecially required.

                     
                        1. Dutifull obeyſance.
                     
                        2. Reſpectfull behauiour.
                     
                        3. Modeſt apparell.
                  
               
               I. Such dutifull and ſubmiſſiue obeyſance and curteſie, as beſeemeth their ſex and place, and that according to the moſt vſuall 1. Seruants obeyſance to their maſters. cuſtome of the country and place where they are, muſt ſeruants performe to their maſters, as they haue occaſion to goe to them, to come from them, to receiue any charge of them, or to bring any meſſage vnto them. Where Iſaak ſaith in his bleſſing giuen to Iaakob, Be lord ouer thy brethren, and let thy mothers ſonnes bowe 
                  
                     Gen. 27. 29. 
                  downe to thee, by that phraſe of bowing downe, he noteth the condition of a ſeruant, and withall implieth a ſeruants dutie: on this ground, when the children of the Prophets ſaw that the ſpirit of Eliah reſted on Eliſha, they taking it for an euident ſigne that God had made him a gouernour and maſter ouer them, they came to 
                  2 King. 2. 15. 
                  meet him, and bowed themſelues to the ground before him.
               
               II. Anſwerable to a ſeruants obeiſance muſt be his whole behauiour 2. Seruants dutifull behauiour before their maſters. before his maſter, ſeaſoned and ordered with ſuch modeſtie and humilitie, as may manifeſt an honourable reſpect to his maſter: as
               1. To ſtand in his maſters preſence; which teſtifieth a readineſſe to performe any ſeruice which his maſter ſhall appoint him to doe: this was one thing noted, and commended by the Queene of Sheba in Solomons ſeruants: ſhe ſaw their 1 King. 10. 5, 8. 
                  ſtanding, and ſaid, happy are theſe thy ſeruants that ſtand before thee. Whereas it is ſaid that ſhe ſaw alſo their ſitting, that phraſe ſheweth a ſeemly order which they obſerued euen when they were out of his preſence, by giuing and taking their right and due place.
               
                  
2. By vncouering their heads in their maſters preſence: this in our dayes, and in the parts of the world where we dwell, is in the male kinde a ſigne and token of ſubiection.
               3. By ſobrietie and modeſtie both in countenance, and in the whole diſpoſition of bodie, eſpecially when ſeruants are in their maſters preſence: for to compoſe countenance and whole bodie ſoberly, becauſe of the preſence of one, argueth a reuerend reſpect of that perſon, for whoſe ſake that ſobrietie is ſhewed.
               III. The apparell alſo which ſeruants weare muſt be ſo faſhioned 3. Seruants ſeemly apparell. and ordered, as it may declare them to be ſeruants, and vnder their maſters, and ſo it will argue a reuerend reſpect of their maſters. One end of apparell, is to ſhew a difference betwixt ſuperiours and inferiours, perſons in authoritie and vnder ſubiection. It pleaſed the Holy Ghoſt to note this particular (and their 
                  1. King. 10. 5. 
                  apparell) as an obſeruable point in Solomons ſeruants.
            
            
               §. 9. Of the faults of ſeruants contrary to reuerence in cariage.
               
               The cariage of many ſeruants towards their maſter is cleane contrary to the forenamed reuerence. For
               1. Some through rudeneſſe, and want of good bringing vp, 1. Rudeneſſe. come to their maſters, and goe from them, as to and from their fellowes: no teſtimonie of reuerence by any obeyſance: they know not how to giue it: whereby they diſhonour their parents, and manner of education.
               2. Others, if at firſt comming to their maſter they giue ſome 2. Too much familiaritie. ſalutation, yet, through too much familiaritie with them, all the day after they will carry themſelues fellow-like, ſcarce vncouering their heads in their maſters preſence, not enduring to ſtand long before him, but either ſetting themſelues downe, or ſlinking away when they ſhould be in preſence. Doubtleſſe from this ouermuch familiaritie aroſe this prouerbe, Good morrow for all day. This vnmannerly familiaritie is commonly in ſuch ſeruants, as haue poore and meane maſters: for rich and great mens ſeruants can be ſo full of curteſie, as not a word ſhall be ſpoken by their maſters to them, or by them to their maſters, but the knee ſhall be bowed withall: they can ſtand houre after houre before their maſters, and not once put on their hat: if they be walking after their maſters, their maſter ſhall not turne ſooner then their hat will be off, and that ſo oft as he turneth or ſpeaketh to them. Why ſhould

rich maſters haue ſo much reuerence ſhewed to them, and poore maſters none at all? Doe not the poore beare Gods image as well as the rich? Doth Gods word make any difference betwixt rich and poore? Doth it ſay, Serue rich maſters with feare and trembling? Surely it is the corruption of mans heart, which maketh this difference. Seruants naturally more regard their maſters outward abilitie, then inward authoritie: the honour which the world conferreth on men, more then the honour which God conferreth: for God hath giuen as much honour and authoritie to a poore maſter as to a rich, in that he is a maſter.
               Seruants commonly moſt faile in this dutie of reuerence towards their maſters there where they ſhould moſt of all ſhew it, namely, in the courts of God, and aſſembly of Gods people, where the very Angels are preſent to behold our ſeemly cariage: thus they cauſe the miniſterie of the word to be euill ſpoken of, and thereby make their ſinne ſo much the more hainous.
               3. Exceeding great is the fault of ſeruants in their exceſſe in apparell. 3. Pride. No diſtinction ordinarily betwixt a mans children and ſeruants: nay none betwixt maſters and their men, miſtreſſes and their maids. It may be while men and maids are at their maſters and miſtreſſes finding, difference may be made: though euen then alſo, if they can any way get wherewithall, they will do what they can to be as braue as they can. But if once they be at their owne finding, all ſhall be laid out vpon apparell, but they will be as fine as maſter or miſtreſſe: if not ſo coſtly, yet in ſhew as ſpecious and braue. New faſhions are as ſoone got vp by ſeruants as by maſters and miſtreſſes. What is the end of this, but to be thought as good as maſter or miſtreſſe? If the Queene of Sheba were now liuing, ſhe would as much wonder at the diſorder of ſeruants in theſe dayes, as then ſhe wondred at the comely order of Solomons ſeruants. Let theſe proud ſeruants looke to it: for if God haue threatned to viſit Princes children that walke in ſtrange apparell, 
                  
                     Zeph. 1. 8. can ſeruants that ſo walke thinke to goe ſcot-free?
               
                  Thus much of ſeruants reuerence.
                  Their obedience followeth.
               
            
            
               §. 10. Of ſeruants obedience.
               
               No inferiours are more bound to obedience then ſeruants: it

is their maine, and moſt peculiar function, to obey their maſters. It is therefore here in my text expreſly mentioned (Seruants obey your maſters) and all other duties are compriſed vnder it. Treat. 3. §. 17. The reaſons alleadged to moue wiues and children to obey, ought much more to moue ſeruants. Treat. 5. §. 11.
               
               They who are contrary minded, who are rebellious, and diſdaine to be vnder the authority of another, and are ready to ſay of their Maſter, We will not haue this man to reigne ouer vs, are fitter 
                     Luke 19. 14. to liue among Anabaptiſts, then orthodoxall Chriſtians. For to what end is the lawfulneſſe of authoritie acknowledged, if ſubiection be not yeelded vnto it? of the two a man were better be blinded with error, then not obey the truth which he knoweth.
               In handling this point of obedience, I will follow the ſame order, which I did in laying forth the obedience of wiues and children, and conſider
               
                  1. The parts of ſeruants obedience wherein it conſiſteth.
                  2. The extent thereof, how farre it reacheth.
               
               The parts are two,
               
                  One negatiue.
                  Another affirmatiue.
               
               The negatiue is to abſtaine from doing things of their owne head, without or againſt their maſters conſent.
               The affirmatiue is readily to yeeld to doe that which their maſters would they ſhould doe.
            
            
               §. 11. Of ſeruants forbearing to doe things without their maſters conſent.
               
               Seruants ought to forbeare doing of things on their owne heads without or againſt conſent of their maſters, becauſe while the time of their ſeruice laſteth, they are not their owne, neither ought the things which they doe, to be for themſelues: both their perſons and their actions are all their maſters: and the will of their maſter muſt be their rule and guide (in things which are not againſt Gods will.) The rite vſed vnder the Law of boaring a ſeruants eare, implied as much. Dauid therefore alluding vnto 
                     Exo. 21. 6. that rite, ſaith to God (both of himſelfe, and alſo of Chriſt, whom vnder a type he prefigured) mine eares haſt thou boared; and from thence inferreth that he would do the will of God. We haue 
                     Pſal. 40. 6. a notable patterne hereof in Abrahams ſeruant, who in a buſineſſe committed to his charge propounds ſuch ſcruples as came 
                     Gen. 24. 5.
                  
into his head to receiue direction from his maſter therein, leſt he ſhould be forced to doe ſomething of his owne head without particular warrant from his maſter.
               This generall will the better be cleared, if it be exemplified in ſome particulars. Take therefore theſe inſtances gathered out of the Scriptures of things which ſeruants may not doe without their maſters conſent.
               1. Seruants may not goe whither they will. The phraſe which the Centurion vſeth (I ſay to one goe, and he goeth) implieth, that except his maſter bid him goe, he ought not to goe. 
                     Mat. 8. 9.
               
               2. They ought not to doe their owne buſineſſe and affaires. It is noted of Iaakob being Labans ſeruant, that, though he 
                     Gen. 30. 35, 36. had flockes of his owne, yet he fed his maſters flockes, and committed his owne to his ſonnes.
               3. They ought not to doe what buſineſſe they liſt themſelues. Ahimaaz had a great deſire to carrie the newes of Abſoloms 
                  2 Sam. 18. 19, &c.
                   death to Dauid: yet without the leaue of Ioab his Captaine and maſter he would not doe it. The good miſtreſſe giueth the portion to her maides, namely, the portion of worke: 
                     Pro. 31. 15. that therefore muſt they doe which ſhe giueth them to doe. The ſeruants of the Centurion did euery one as by their maſter 
                     Mat. 8. 9. Mat. 25. 16, 17. they were inioyned: and the ſeruants that had talents committed to them looked each of them to their owne talent.
               4. They ought not to mary while the time of their couenant for ſeruice laſteth, vnleſſe their maſter giue conſent thereto. The law of God thus ſetteth forth the lawfull mariages of ſeruants, If his maſter haue giuen him a wife: whereby is implied; 
                     Exo. 21. 4. that if a ſeruant mary, it muſt be with his maſters conſent.
               
                  
                     Obiect. The Apoſtle, without exception of ſeruants ſaith, to auoid fornication let euery man haue his wife, &c. 1 Cor. 7. 2.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. He there ſheweth what meanes the Lord hath ſanctified to euery one to auoid fornication, but he doth not thereby giue libertie to euery one headily to vſe that meanes againſt that order which God hath ſet downe.
                  2. That precept is giuen to ſuch as are Sui iuris. 
                     in their owne power: for of children he ſaith, that 1 Cor. 7. 36, &c.
                      parents muſt ſee what is meet or not meet for them.
                  
                     
3. That which ſeruants are to gather from thence is, if need ſo require, to make knowne their deſire to their maſter, and to vſe all the good meanes they can by themſelues or others to obtaine their maſters conſent.
                  5. They ought not to diſpoſe their maſters goods at their owne pleaſure, no not for charitable vſes. The Steward which 
                        Luk. 16. 1, 2. waſted his maſters goods was iuſtly put out of office for it. Yea he is called vniuſt for diſpoſing ſome of them for his owne 
                        verſ. 8. future maintenance; therefore it was a point of iuſtice and vnlawfull.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. The Lord commended him therein.
                  
                     Anſw. He commended his wiſdome, not his iniuſtice: his prouident care for the time to come, not the meanes of prouiding for himſelfe. In regard of his generall prouidence he is commended: in regard of the particular meanes by deceiuing his maſter, he is called vniuſt.
                  
                  6. They may not before their couenanted time be expired goe away from their maſter. When 
                        Gen. 30. 26. 
                     Iaakob after long ſeruice had a minde to be gone, he asked leaue, and becauſe his vncle and maſter would not willingly let him goe, he tarried ſtill.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. Afterwards 
                        & 31. 20. 
                     Iaakob priuily ſtole away from his maſter.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. His couenanted time was out. 2. He had an expreſſe warrant from God to be gone. 3. His manner of going away is not to be iuſtified, and in that reſpect it is no good patterne.
               
            
            
               §. 12. Of the vnlawfull libertie which ſeruants take to themſelues.
               
               Contrary to the forenamed limitations of ſeruants libertie are theſe, and ſuch like lewd and licentious pranks as follow.
               1. When ſeruants watch their times to goe whither they liſt, and their maſter not know it: as when their maſters are seriouſly imployed, or abroad, or in bed. Thus that lewd ſeruant Gehazi watched his time to run after Naaman, thinking that 2 King. 5. 20. his maſter ſhould not know it.
               2. When being bound to their maſters ſeruice, they doe their owne buſineſſe, and ſeeke their owne profit; and that without their maſters leaue. This aggrauated Gehazi his priuie

ſtealing and withdrawing himſelfe from his maſter, that he went to receiue gifts for himſelfe. Many ſuch lewd ſeruants there be, that knowing ſuch and ſuch friends of their maſter, who will be ready to doe any kindneſſe for them, will vſe their maſters name to borow money, or get ſome other fauour, and neuer let their-maſters know of it.
               3. When ſeruants will chuſe their owne worke, and doe that which liketh themſelues beſt, or elſe doe nothing at all. Thus where many ſeruants be in one houſe together, if they be not in ſuch places as they like themſelues, they will mumble, and grumble, and doe nothing well.
               4. When ſeruants, eſpecially maid-ſeruants, that are bound, doe purpoſely mary to free themſelues: becauſe our lawes doe free a maide that is maried from her ſeruice to maſter and miſtreſſe.
               5. When they are liberall of their maſters goods in giuing them away. Some thinke that becauſe they are of the houſe, they may diſpoſe the things of the houſe vpon charitable vſes. But pretence of charitie is no excuſe for iniuſtice. Seruants may giue notice to their maſters or miſtreſſes, that there are in the houſe ſuch and ſuch things meet to be giuen away, or that there are ſuch and ſuch poore folkes that ſtand in great need: but priuily without any conſent at all, they may not giue away any thing of their maſters.
               6. When vpon diſcontent they run away from their maſters. The two ſeruants of Shemei which run from their maſter 1 King. 2. 39. Philem. ver. 12. Gen. 16. 9. are taxed for it by the holy Ghoſt. One ſimus that run from his maſter is ſent backe againe by S. Paul: and Hagar is ſent backe by an Angell.
               
                  
                     Obiect. What if maſter and miſtreſſe be ſharpe, rigorous, and cruell.
                  
                     Anſw. An Angell from heauen giueth one anſwer, (Submit 
                     
                        Gen. 16. 9. 
                     thy ſelfe vnder her hands:) And an Apoſtle giueth another, Be ſubiect with all feare to the froward: for conſcience toward 
                     1 Pet. 2. 18, 19. 
                     God endure griefe, ſuffering wrongfully.
                  
                  Theſe faults are thus noted, that ſeruants taking notice of them, may the more carefully auoid them.
               
            
            
               
               §. 13. Of ſeruants obedience to their maſters commandements.
               
               The affirmatiue and actiue part of ſeruants obedience, conſiſting in a ready yeelding to that which their maſters will haue done, hath reſpect (as the like kinde of childrens obedience) to the Commandement, Inſtruction, Reproofe, and Correction of their maſter.
               I. A maſter hauing power to command his ſeruants, it is What maſters command, ſeruants muſt doe. a dutie of ſeruants to obey their maſter therein. The particular worke which appertaineth to a ſeruant by vertue of his place is to haue an eie to his maſter, to ſee what he requireth at his hands. Dauid thus deſcribes the property of good ſeruants, Their eies looke to the hand of their maſter. That looking, as it 
                     Pſal. 123. 2. implieth an expectation of releefe and ſuccour, ſo alſo a readineſſe to receiue and execute any thing from them that they would haue done. The Centurion commendeth this duty 
                     Mat. 8. 9. in the example of his ſeruants, who euery one of them did what their maſter commanded them to doe. It is further commended in the examples of 
                     Gen. 24. 9. 
                  Abrams ſeruant, 1 King. 18. 43. 
                  Eliahs ſeruant, and many others. Note how farre the Lord Chriſt exacteth this dutie of ſeruants; 
                     Luk. 17. 7, 8. Though a ſeruant hath beene all day plowing (a laborious and weariſome worke) yet when he commeth home, his maſter commanding him to dreſſe his ſupper and wait, he muſt doe it. By all theſe proofes it appeareth, that if a maſter bid his ſeruant, come, goe, doe this, or that, he muſt obey.
               The contrary hereunto is the higheſt degree of diſobedience, Contrary. Refuſing to be at command. 2 Sam. 19. 26. as when ſeruants refuſe to be at their maſters command, and to doe what they charge them to doe: as Ziba, who being commanded to ſaddle his maſters Aſſe, went away and did it not: and Iobs ſeruants, who being called would not anſwer. 
                     Iob 19. 16. Of all other offences this doth moſt prouoke maſters: for it is a plaine contempt of their authoritie.
            
            
               §. 14. Of ſeruants hearkning to their maſters inſtructions in matters of their calling.
               
               II. As a maſter hath power to command, ſo his dutie it is to See Treat. 8. §. 21, 38. inſtruct his ſeruants in the way of righteouſneſſe, and in that ciuill courſe of life wherein he is to walke. The dutie then of ſeruants it is, in both to hearken and be obedient vnto them.
               
                  
1. Such ſeruants as are vnder maſters to learne their trade, are bound many waies to hearken to them.
               1. That for the time they may doe the better ſeruice to their maſters.
               2. That by learning a trade or skill in any good calling they may be the better able when the time of their ſeruice is out to maintaine themſelues, to teach other ſeruants which ſhall be vnder them, and to doe the more good in the place where they ſhall liue.
               3. That thus they may the better diſcharge a good conſcience in that particular place wherein God hath ſet them.
               Contrary is the idle, ſluggiſh, dull diſpoſition of many ſeruants, who by reaſon of their careleſneſſe and vntowardneſſe in doing that which they are taught, vex and grieue their maſters, yea and make them weary of inſtructing them. Many prentiſes ſpend all the time of their prentiſhip without reaping any good at all: they neuer proue their crafts maſters: ſo many in the countrey liue vnder good husbands, many Clearks vnder good Lawyers, many maids vnder good houſwiues, and that many yeares together, yet through their negligence get no good at all, whereas if they would haue beene attentiue and carefull, they might haue learned much. Enemies theſe are to their maſters, to themſelues, to the city and country where they liue, and to their friends and parents, eſpecially if they haue any aliue.
            
            
               §. 15. Of ſeruants hearkning to their maſters inſtructions in piety.
               
               Such ſeruants as haue religious maſters who are carefull to Obedience of ſeruants to pious inſtructions. inſtruct their houſhold in the way of righteouſneſſe, ought to be obedient to their inſtructions: ſo were Ioſuahs ſeruants, (or elſe could not Ioſuah haue vndertaken for them 
                     Ioſ. 24. 15. as he did) and the ſeruants of that Ruler of whom it was ſaid that himſelfe beleeued 
                  c Iohn 4. 53. 
                  and all his houſe: and the ſeruants of Lidia, and of the Iay
                  
                     •
                  er, concerning whom it is ſaid, 
                     Acts 16. 15, 
                  She was baptiſed and her houſhold: 
                  34. 
                  he beleeued in God and all his houſe. Vnder theſe words houſe and houſhold, none doubteth but that ſeruants are compriſed.
               Now then if the ſeruants of theſe had not hearkened and

yeelded to the inſtructions of their maſter and miſtreſſe, would they haue beleeued in him in whom their maſters beleeued, or beene baptiſed when their miſtreſſe was? The like may be gathered out of this phraſe, 
                     Rom. 16. 5. Philem. v. 2. 
                  The Church in their houſe: for thereby is implied that all in the houſe were of the ſame faith that their maſter and miſtreſſe were. It is expreſly noted of the 
                     Act. 10. 7. Souldier that waited continually on Cornelius, that he was a deuout man, whereby it is preſuppoſed that he hearkned to his maſters inſtructions: for it is noted of the maſter alſo, that 
                     Verſ. 2. 
                  he was a deuout man and feared God.
               
               The benefit which redoundeth to ſeruants by obeying ſuch inſtructions, is vnſpeakable: much more good may be got by following the ſpirituall directions of religious maſters, then the witty and commodious directions of the wiſeſt ſtateſmen, and the skilfulleſt artiſts, or tradeſmen that be: ſo as there is a double bond to binde ſeruants to obey this kinde of inſtructions:

                     1. The bond of duty.
                     2. The bond of profit and benefit to themſelues.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 16. Of Seruants faults contrary to obedience in matters of religion.
               
               Notwithſtanding the forenamed duty be ſo behouefull to ſeruants, yet of all other duties is it by many leaſt thought to be a duty, and moſt neglected, the cleane contrary for the moſt part being practiſed, as may appeare by theſe particulars.
               1. Many ſeruants are of ſo impious a minde, as of all maſters Contrary, 1. Loth to ſerue religious maſters. they will not ſerue ſuch as are religious, and make conſcience to inſtruct their ſeruants in the way to ſaluation: they had rather ſerue profane maſters, meere worldlings, and very Papiſts. For why? any thing better agreeth to corrupt nature then to be kept within the bounds of religion: few like the ſtrait gate and narrow way that leadeth to life: for the god of this world ſo blindeth mens eies, that they cannot ſee the bleſſing of life at the end of this way, they only ſee the ſtraitneſſe of it: or if they ſhould ſee it a farre off, yet they ſo ſauour the things of the fleſh, and of this preſent euill world, as they would not regard that which is ſo farre off. Now religious maſters will endeuour what they can to keepe all their ſeruants in that narrow

way; but irreligious maſters will ſuffer them to follow the ſway of their owne corruption, to ſweare, to profane the Sabboth, and ſpend that whole day in ſleeping, ſporting, eating and drinking: to goe to bed without prayer, or catechizing, or reading the word of God, and ſo to riſe againe and goe about their buſineſſe: to which holy duties, ſuch deuout maſters as Cornelius was, will hold their ſeruants.
               2. Others that are placed by their friends vnder ſuch deuout 2. Mutter againſt them being in ſeruice. maſters, or not knowing before hand the diſpoſition of their maſters, haue themſelues couenanted with them to be their ſeruants, after they haue beene a while in the houſe, thinke their maſters houſe a priſon to them, muttering and murmuring againſt their ſtrait keeping in, as they deeme it: and being called in to any religious exerciſe, they will be ready to ſay, I was not hired for this, neither am I bound to you herein, ſet me about your worke and I will doe it.
               
               3. Some againe are the more negligent and diſſolute in their 3. Negligent becauſe maſters religious. buſineſſe, becauſe their maſters are religious. It is a common complaint, that profane, worldly maſters ſhal haue more ſeruice then religious and godly maſters, yea though theſe giue better wages, diet and lodging then thoſe. Many thinke the fault hereof to be in the maſter: but aſſuredly for the moſt part the fault is the corrupt diſpoſition of ſeruants, that eſteeme pleaſure in ſinne, and libertie thereunto more then wages, diet, and lodging: whereby they ſhew themſelues impious againſt God, vngratefull to their maſters, iniurious to themſelues. Let this peruerſe diſpoſition be noted, that the rule of the Apoſtle verie pertinent to this point, may be the better obſerued, They 
                  1 Tim. 6. 2. 
                  that haue beleeuing maſters let them not deſpiſe them, but rather doe them ſeruice, becauſe they are faithfull and beloued.
               
            
            
               §. 17. Of ſeruants obedience to reproofe and correction.
               
               The ſame directions may ſerue for yeelding to reproofe and correction: for they may both be brought to one head: and in the generall they doe both agree. For reproofe is a verball correction, and correction is a reall reproofe.
               The obedience which ſeruants in regard of theſe muſt ſhew to their maſters is twofold.
               1. Patiently to beare all manner of reproofe and correction.
               
                  
2. Readily to amend that for which they are iuſtly reproued or corrected.
               For the firſt of theſe, ſeruants haue an expreſſe precept, enforced 1 Pet. 2. 18. &c.
                   by many reaſons in theſe words, Seruants be ſubiect to your maſters with all feare, not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward. For this is thanke worthy if a man for conſcience toward God endure griefe, ſuffering wrongfully. For what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye take it patiently? but if whey ye doe well and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. Here we ſee,
               1. That correction is patiently to be borne by ſeruants: if correction, then much more reproofe.
               2. That though correction be iniuſtly inflicted, yet it is patiently to be endured: therefore much more when it is deſerued.
               3. That buffeting and that of a froward maſter is to be borne: therefore much more lighter correction of a good and gentle maſter. Ioſeph patiently endured 
                     Pſal. 105. 18. 
                  fetters, and yron chaines, and 
                     Gen. 39. 20. 
                  impriſonment inflicted vpon him moſt vniuſtly, euen for his faithfulneſſe to his maſter. Great was the recompence which God made vnto him: & aſſuredly God will recompence all the wrong, paine, and griefe, that in this caſe ſhall be endured for conſcience ſake. For the Apoſtle ſaith, that this is thankworthy, that is, worthy of praiſe and commendation, and ſo worthy of recompence and reward. Againe he ſaith that it is acceptable to God, ſo as God will recompence it, though men may account it but baſeneſſe and blockiſhneſſe: yea though vniuſt maſters may thereupon take occaſion the more to trample vpon, and inſult ouer their ſeruants.
               To theſe motiues I may adde the rule of our Chriſtian profeſſion (which is alſo intimated by the Apoſtle in theſe words, 1 Pet. 2. 21. 
                  Euen hereunto were ye called.) For our Chriſtian calling requireth all men to 
                     Rom. 12. 19. 
                  giue place vnto wrath: 
                  
                     Matt. 5. 39. To turne the other cheeke when one is ſmitten: 
                  
                     Rom. 12. 21. To ouercome euill with goodneſſe. 
                  1 Pet. 2. 21. If all Chriſtians muſt ſhew ſuch patience to all men, euen their equals: how much more ſeruants to maſters? The Apoſtle commendeth to ſeruants the example of Chriſt in this caſe: he was reuiled and much he ſuffered, and that moſt iniuriouſly, and

yet patiently did he beare all: if ſeruants thus ſuffer with him, they alſo ſhall reigne with him.
            
            
               §. 18. Of the extremes contrary to ſeruants patient bearing of reproofe and correction.
               
               Patient bearing of rebuke and blowes, ſeemeth an hard ſaying to moſt ſeruants: they cannot endure to heare it: for their minde and carriage is cleane contrary thereunto.
               1. Some being but reproued, though iuſtly, are ready to anſwer againe, and to chop word for word: a ſinne 
                     Tit. 2. 9. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . expreſly forbidden. It ſeemeth by the Apoſtles expreſſe mentioning of it, that anſwering againe hath beene an old euill quality in ſeruants.
               
                  
                     Obiect. If a maſter vniuſtly reproue his ſeruant, and the ſeruant anſwer not againe, he wittingly ſuffereth his maſter to continue in his error, and ſo maketh himſelfe acceſſary to his maſters ſinne.
                  
                     Anſw. There is difference betwixt a ſpightfull, reuengefull contradicting of that which is ſpoken, and an humble, mild, reuerend, ſeaſonable apologie for that which is vniuſtly cenſured. This is lawfull: but that is forbidden.
               
            
            
               2. Others ſcorne to be corrected: which diſdaine they manifeſt many waies: as
               1. By muttering, and ſaying they came not for that end. But though that were not the maine end of their ſubiection, yet is it a meanes to keepe them vnder ſubiection: and therefore to be endured by them.
               2. By running away, as See §. 12. 
                  Hagar.
               
               3. By ſtrugling and ſtriuing with their maſter or miſtreſſe: and taking the ſtaffe or wand by the end: or by holding the hands of thoſe that correct them.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Shall I ſuffer my ſelfe wrongfully to be beaten, when I can helpe my ſelfe and hinder it?
                  
                     Anſw. 1. Seruants may not be their owne Iudges whether their correction be iuſt or vniuſt: for men are ſo prone to ſooth themſelues and to extenuate the euill actions which they doe, as if they be not corrected till they thinke it iuſt, they would neuer be corrected.
                  2. To endure puniſhment (that I may vſe Saint Peters
                     
word) is not otherwaies thanke-worthy. If iuſtly thou beeſt puniſhed, thou haſt but thy deſert. If forcibly ſo as thou canſt not reſiſt, neceſſity maketh thee beare it. The ſturdieſt theeues that be, being pinnied, ſuffer themſelues to be turned ouer, becauſe they ſee a neceſſity. But Chriſt (whoſe 1 Pet. 2. 21. example in this caſe is ſet before ſeruants) 
                        Mat. 26. 53. could haue freed himſelfe but would not. If ſeruants endure for conſcience ſake, they will not reſiſt, though they be able.
                  3. Others if they be ſmitten by maſter or miſtreſſe, will giue as much as they receiue, they will ſmite againe: a practiſe vnbeſeeming any Chriſtian, but moſt vnſeemely for Chriſtian ſeruants: who manifeſt thereby a deſpight of Gods image and power in their maſters.
                  4. Others are ſo poſſeſſed with a deuill, as they will ſeeke all the reuenge they can, if they be corrected: whence it commeth to paſſe that ſome hot, heady, hardy youth, ſticke not to challenge their maſters into the field: and others, more maliciouſly minded, ſecretly endeuour to take away the life of their maſters. Many that haue not the opportunity to practiſe ſuch villanies, doe notwithſtanding in their hearts wiſh their maſters deſtruction, and make moſt fearefull imprecations againſt them; whereby they make themſelues guilty of blood before God.
               
            
            
               §. 19. Of ſeruants amending that for which they are iuſtly reproued or corrected.
               
               More then patience is required of them that are deſeruedly rebuked or corrected for their faults: namely See more of this point Treat. 5. §. 33. & 34. repentance, and amendment. Thus ſhall the ſmart and paine which ſeruants endure, be as good phyſicke vnto them, and turne to their good. True amendment of former faults may make one a better ſeruant then he was before he committed thoſe faults: witneſſe that which Saint Paul ſaith of Oneſimus, 
                  
                     Philem. verſ. 11. 
                  in time paſt he was to thee vnprofitable, but now profitable to thee and me.
               
               Contrary is their diſpoſition, who notwithſtanding all rebuke and correction goe on ſtill in their euill and lewd courſes: and continue to prouoke their maſter more and more, and ſo make them adde blow vnto blow, and ſtroke vnto ſtroke, till they haue no hope of them, but are forced to put them out

of doores. This commeth either from a ſcornfull, diſdainfull ſtomach (for 
                     Pro. 13. 1. 
                  a ſcorner heareth not rebuke) or from a baſe, ſeruile, ſtupid, blockiſh, brutiſh nature, that is not moued with any ſmart or paine, like a reſtie iade that will not ſtirre though he be whipt or beaten neuer ſo much. 
                     Pro. 26. 3. 
                  Solomon implieth thus much by putting into one leaſh an horſe, an aſſe, and a foole: meaning by a foole a ſcornfull, blockiſh ſeruant: to whoſe backe a rod is as a whip to an horſe: of ſuch a foole he ſaith, that 
                     Pro. 17. 10. 
                  an hundred ſtripes enter not into him: and againe, 
                     Pro. 27. 22. 
                  Though thou ſhouldeſt bray a foole in a morter among wheat with a peſtle, yet will not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.
               
               But what ſhall we ſay of ſuch as for rebuke and correction are the worſe? What, but that ſhame, beggery, and ſome ignominious death or other is like to befall them.
               Hitherto of the kindes of ſeruants duties. The next point reſpecteth the manner of performing them.
            
            
               §. 20. Of ſeruing with trembling.
               
               The Manner how ſeruants ought to performe their duties is noted in foure phraſes:
               The firſt whereof is this, with feare and trembling. 
                  I.
               
               
                  Feare is both as a fountaine from whence all other duties flow: and alſo as a ſawce to ſeaſon them all.
               Commonly the ſeaſon and ſauour of waters commeth from the fountaine: which Saint Iames implieth, where he ſaith, no fountaine doth yeeld ſalt water and freſh: for if the fountaine be 
                     Iam. 3. 12. ſalt, the ſtreames iſſuing from thence will be ſalt: and freſh, if the fountaine be freſh: ſo if feare be ſeated in the heart of ſeruants, all their obedience and ſubmiſſion will be ſeaſoned therewith. Let therefore ſeruants here learne by their manner of performing all their duties, to declare that there is a true ſeruant-like feare ſeated in their hearts. Hereof I ſhall need ſay no more then what hath beene §. 4. before deliuered.
               The other word See Treat. 1. §. 124. 
                  trembling added to feare, addeth emphaſis, ſhewing that it is no ſmall feare that is required of ſeruants: and it giueth them to wit that their maſters hauing a power to puniſh them, they muſt ſo carrie themſelues as they prouoke not their maſter to wrath, but be very carefull and circumſpect to auoid his diſpleaſure, that they giue him no iuſt occaſion

of offence. This care had that ſeruant of Dauid which firſt eſpied Abſolom hanging in a tree, and told Ioab thereof: 2 Sam. 18. 12. he ſo feared the diſpleaſure of the king his maſter, as to gaine a thouſand ſhekels of ſiluer he durſt not kill Abſolom. The like is noted of Obadiah, who was afraid to tell his maſter Ahab where Eliah was, left his maſter might haue thought he had mocked him, if the Spirit had carried Eliah away. 1 King. 18. 9. &c.
                  
               
               This trembling feare is needfull in regard of the ſmall loue that ſeruants commonly beare to their maſters. There are not thoſe motiues to ſtirre vp loue in ſeruants to their maſters, as in children to their parents: except therefore through awe and dread they be kept in compaſſe, they will exceedingly tranſgreſſe: and becauſe this is ſo needfull, ſeruants muſt labour to nouriſh it, as a meanes to keepe them from ouer-much boldneſſe.
               Contrary on the one ſide is a proud deſpiſing of a maſters authority (ſaying, if not with their mouthes, yet in their heart, as Gaal of Abimelech, who is he that we ſhould ſerue him? or as thoſe that deſpiſed the gouernment of Chriſt their maſter, 
                     Iudg. 9. 28. 
                  
                     Luk. 19. 14. 
                  we will not haue this man to reigne ouer vs: and againe, 
                     Pſal. 2. 3. 
                  let vs breake his bonds aſunder, and caſt away his cords from vs.) And on the other ſide a wretched careleſſeneſſe, not fearing any puniſhment before they feele it: like to many deſperate theeues that no whit feare the power of the Iudge, but deſperatly ſay, we haue but one death to pay. The authority of God himſelfe is deſpiſed, and his reuenging hand is lightly regarded by ſuch proud and deſperate ſeruants: ſo as their ſinne is no ſmall ſinne.
            
            
               §. 21. Of ſeruing with ſincerity.
               
               The ſecond branch concerning the manner of ſeruants performing their dutie is in theſe words, in ſingleneſſe of heart, 
                  11. ſo as all muſt be performed with an honeſt and vpright heart: whatſoeuer yee doe, doe it heartily, ſaith the Apoſtle to ſeruants 
                     Col. 3. 23. in another place. Thus did Ioſeph in ſingleneſſe of heart ſerue his maſter: inſtance his refuſing to abuſe his miſtreſſe in 
                     Gen. 39. 11, 12. a priuate chamber when ſhe deſired it, and no other body was in the houſe. Happy were it for maſters to haue ſuch ſeruants: then might they take no more care then Potiphar did, but put 
                     Gen. 39. 6.
                  
all that they haue into their ſeruants hands. Neither would this rare vertue in ſeruants be only profitable to their maſters, but alſo very comfortable to themſelues, and bring them much peace of conſcience.
               Contrary is hypocriticall ſeruice: when ſeruants haue a heart, and a heart, making ſhew-of one heart outwardly, and haue another, euen a cleane contrary heart within them. Such 
                     Pſal. 12. 2. an one was Gehazi, who came in and ſtood before his maſter, as if he had performed ſome good ſeruice for his maſter, when 2. King 5. 25. he had moſt highly diſhonoured him: and ſuch an one was Iudas who carried as faire a face to his maſter as any of the diſciples, and yet was an arrant traitor: for when he was thought to goe out to buy prouiſion for his maſter, he went to 
                     Iohn 13. 29. betray him.
               All eye-ſeruice is contrary to the forenamed ſingleneſſe of heart: when ſeruants are diligent ſo long as their maſters eye is on them: Eye ſeruice. like little children that will doe any thing their mother will haue them doe, while her eye is vpon them; but nothing, when her backe is turned. The world is full of ſuch eye-ſeruing ſeruants, who while their maſters are preſent, will be as buſie as Bees: but if he be away, then either idling at home, or gadding abroad, or nothing but wrangling, and eating, and drinking with the drunken; like that lewd ſeruant whom Chriſt noteth in the parable 
                     Matth. 24. 49. Let the iudgement denounced againſt him be noted of ſuch ſeruants.
            
            
               §. 22. Of ſeruing for conſcience ſake.
               
               The third branch of the manner of ſeruants performing III. Sit ſeruus non vt ſeruus ad oculum, ſed vt domini ſtudioſus. Conſtit. Apoſt. l. 4. c. 12. their dutie is in theſe words, as vnto Chriſt, as the ſeruants of Chriſt, doing the will of God, as to the Lord: all which doe ſet forth a good conſcience, or ſuch ſeruice as is performed for conſcience ſake, or for the Lords ſake, which is all one: becauſe the conſcience hath an eye only to the Lord, to his will, and to his ordinance. Though there were no other motiue in the world to moue them to obey their maſters, yet their conſcience to God would moue them. Such was Ioſephs manner of ſeruing his maſter, as the reaſon which he himſelfe rendreth to his miſtreſſe ſheweth, How can I doe this great wickedneſſe, and ſinne againſt God? The 
                     Gen. 39. 9. prayer which Abrahams ſeruant made to God, and the thanks 
                     Gen. 24. 12, 27.
                  
which he rendred to him for bleſſing his iourney, ſhew, that he ſerued his maſter for the Lords ſake. It is more cleare then needs be proued, that ſuch was Iaakobs ſeruice to his maſter. This is the rather to be noted of Chriſtian ſeruants, becauſe herein lieth the greateſt difference betwixt beleeuing ſeruants, and others: others may ſerue with feare and trembling, in ſingleneſſe of heart, and with good will; but only Saints doe ſeruice as to Chriſt for conſcience ſake: If this be not that which only they aime at, yet aſſuredly they doe chiefly and principally aime at it: which maketh them not to content themſelues with doing the thing, but to endeuour to doe it after the beſt manner that they can, ſo as God may beſt accept thereof: whereby as they approue themſelues to God, ſo they doe much good to their maſters, and bring much comfort vnto their owne ſoules.
               Contrary is the minde of moſt, who doe all the ſeruice which Seruice on by-reſpects. they doe on by-reſpects: they may performe much dutie, and it may be doe much good to their maſters; and thereupon they may get good wages at their maſters hands, and extraordinarie recompence alſo, and liue in much quiet vnder them: but no reward can they looke for at Gods hands: ſo as I may ſay to ſuch ſeruants, as Chriſt ſaid to thoſe who did all to haue glory of men, They haue their reward. 
                  
                     Matth. 6. 2.
               
            
            
               §. 23. Of ſeruants willingneſſe to performe their dutie.
               
               The fourth branch reſpecting the manner of ſeruants performing IIII. their dutie, is noted in this phraſe, with good will. This good will of a ſeruant to his maſter, hath reſpect partly to the diſpoſition of the ſeruant, and ſo it implieth willingneſſe and cheerefulneſſe; Seruice to be done cheerefully. and partly to the benefit of the maſter, and ſo it implieth faithfulneſſe.
               
               Of willingneſſe to doe that dutie which belongeth to a ſeruant, Chriſt Ieſus (who 
                     Phil. 2. 7. 
                  tooke vpon him the forme of a ſeruant) hath made himſelfe a worthy patterne. 
                     Pſal. 40. 8. 
                  I delight to doe thy will, ſaith he to him that ſent him: and againe, 
                     Joh. 4. 34. 
                  My meat is to doe the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his worke. Doth not a man eat his meat willingly, with delight and cheerefulneſſe? euen ſo did Chriſt the worke of him that ſent him. So cheerefully did Iaakob ſerue his Vncle Laban, that 
                     Gen. 29. 20. 
                  ſeuen yeeres ſeemed to him but a few dayes.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Obiect. The reaſon thereof was the loue he had to Rachel.
                  
                  1. Anſw. This was one reaſon, but not the only reaſon: had he not borne good will to his Vncle and Maſter, as well as loue to his wife, the time might haue ſeemed tedious enough: but both meeting together, made the time paſſe away the better.
                  2. Anſw. If the loue he had to Rachel made him doe his ſeruice ſo cheerefully: then if ſeruants loue God, for whoſe ſake they ought to doe their ſeruice, it will cheerefully be done.
                  1. That which the Apoſtle applieth to giuing of almes (2 Cor. 9. 7.) may be extended to all manner of duties which God requireth, God loueth cheerefulneſſe: that worke therefore which is not ſeaſoned therewith God regardeth not.
                  2. As cheerefulneſſe maketh God the better to like the worke, ſo it maketh the worke much more eaſie to him that doth it. Our common prouerbe noteth as much, Nothing is hard to a willing minde.
                  
                  3. 
                        Apoſtolus ſeruos monet dominis ſuis ex animo cum bona voluntate ſeruire, vt ſcilicet ſi non poſſunt à dominis liberi fieri, ſuam ſeruitutem ipſi quodammedo liberam faciant. Aug de Ciu. Dei, l. 19. c. 15. Direction.
                      Let there be cheerefulneſſe in a ſeruants minde, and he is as free as his maſter: for ſuch a ſeruant is the Lords freeman (1 Cor. 7. 22.) and when he cannot be made free of his maſter, he doth after a manner make his ſeruice free.
                  Haue an eye to God, to his acceptation, and remuneration, and it will quicken thy ſpirit. Mans reward maketh poore men glad of worke, and cheerefull in doing their worke: it is as ſugar to ſharpe wine. Tradeſmen, Phyſitians, Lawyers, all ſorts of men, are by gaine drawne on with great willingneſſe to take great paines. Should not Gods recompence of our paines make vs much more willing? Surely it would, if we had ſuch an eye of 
                        Heb. 11. 26. faith as Moſes had, thereby to ſee the recompence of reward which he ſaw.
                  Contrary is heauineſſe of ſpirit, and diſcontentedneſſe of minde, Contrary, Diſcontentedneſſe. when ſeruants doe their ſeruice lowringly, grudgingly, by compulſion (as Beares are brought to a ſtake) and of neceſſitie, as ſlaues in a galley. Such ſeruice muſt needs be vntowardly done: but though outwardly it be well done, yet can the doer haue little comfort therein, becauſe God accepteth it not.
               
            
            
               §. 24. Of ſeruants quickneſſe and diligence in their ſeruice.
               
               Seruants, in teſtimonie of their willingneſſe and cheerefulneſſe, muſt be both quicke and diligent in their ſeruice: for theſe

are effects of willingneſſe. Quickneſſe hath reſpect to the time of doing a thing. Diligence to the paines that is taken about it.
               He that is quicke in his ſeruice taketh vp no more time about Quickneſſe. one thing then muſt needs; but is ready to doe one thing after another; and thus doth much more ſeruice. It is expreſly noted of Rebekah, that ſhe 
                     Gen. 24. 18, 20. 
                  haſted, and let downe her pitcher: and haſted and emptied her pitcher, and ran againe to the Well. And Abrahams ſeruant hauing made what ſpeed he could to the place whither he was ſent, 
                     Gen. 24. 33. 
                  would not eat till he had told his errand: after he had told it, if he had not ſped, 
                     verſ. 49. he would not haue delaied time, but haue gone againe forthwith: when he had well diſpatched all, 
                     verſ. 56. he would not ſtay vpon any complements, but haſted away to his maſter. 2 Sam. 18. 23. 
                  Ahimaaz ſtroue with Cuſhi who ſhould ſooneſt bring their meſſage to their maſter: and Ahimaaz outſtript Cuſhi, for he had a very willing minde to doe the buſineſſe. The manner of charge which Eliſha gaue to his ſeruant, implieth all the ſpeed he could make: it was this, 2 King. 4. 29. 
                  Gird vp thy loynes, goe thy way: if thou meet any by the way, ſalute him not: and if any ſalute thee, anſwer him not againe.
               
               He that is diligent in his ſeruice, will not only be quicke for the Diligence. time, but alſo hold on, and imploy all the labour and paines that he can for the well effecting of that which he is to doe. That generall charge laid vpon all men, in particular appertaineth to a ſeruant (
                     Gen. 3. 19. 
                  In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat bread) and that which Solomon noteth (
                     Eccl. 9. 10. 
                  what ſoeuer thine hand findeth to doe, doe it with thy might.) Great was Iaakobs diligence (for he ſaith of himſelfe in doing his maſters buſineſſe, 
                     Gen. 31. 40. 
                  In the day the drought conſumed me, and the frost by night, and my ſleepe departed from mine eyes.) Great alſo was the diligence of thoſe ſhepherds, that 
                     Luke 2. 8. 
                  kept watch ouer their flocke by night: and of 
                     Mat. 25. 16, 17. thoſe ſeruants, that by their paines doubled the talents which were committed to them. As diligence is by theſe and many like examples commended vnto vs, ſo is it further ſet forth by the many promiſes which are made vnto it, as, 
                     Pro. 10. 4. 
                  The hand of the diligent maketh rich: 
                  
                     & 12. 14. 
                  The recompence of a mans hands ſhall be rendred vnto him: 
                  
                     verſ. 24. 
                  The hand of the diligent ſhall be are rule: 
                  
                     & 14. 23. 
                  In all labour there is profit.
               
               The worke which ſeruants are by their maſter appointed to doe, is to them the worke of God: whereupon the Apoſtle ſaith

to ſeruants as well as to others, 1 Cor. 7. 17. 
                  as God hath called euery one, ſo let him walke: but the worke of God is to be done with all diligence: for 
                     Jer. 48. 10. 
                  Curſed is he that doth the worke of the Lord negligently.
               
               Contrary is the idleneſſe, lazineſſe, ſlothfulneſſe, and ſluggiſhneſſe Idleneſſe. of ſeruants. Theſe are faults too too common. Solomon much inueigheth againſt theſe vices, ſetting them forth in their kinde, and ſetting downe the many miſchiefes that follow thereupon.
               Thus he deciphereth them; 
                     Pro. 26. 13, 14, 15. 
                  The ſlothfull man ſaith, there is a Lion in the way (that is, he pretendeth vnlikely danger) As the doore turneth vpon the hinges, ſo a ſlothfull man vpon his bed. The ſlothfull hideth his hand in his boſome, it grieueth him to bring it againe to his mouth. 
                  
                     & 24. 33. 
                  Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleepe.
               
               Theſe are the miſchiefes which he noteth to come from idleneſſe and ſloth, 
                     & 10. 4. 
                  Pouertie, 
                  
                     & 12. 24. 
                  Seruitude, 
                  
                     & 13. 4. 
                  Fruitleſſe wiſhes and deſires, 
                  
                     & 19. 15. 
                  Hunger, 
                  
                     & 20. 4. 
                  Beggerie, 
                  
                     & 21. 25. 
                  Death. And to ſhew what ſmall ioy or comfort maſters may haue in ſlothfull ſeruants, he compareth them to vineger and ſmoke, which are as irkeſome to the teeth and eyes as can be: 
                     & 10. 26. 
                  As vineger (ſaith he) is to the teeth, and ſmoke to the eyes, ſo is the ſluggard to them that ſend him. And becauſe many idle packs thinke and ſay they doe no hurt, he further ſaith, that 
                     & 18. 9. 
                  He that is ſlothfull in his worke is brother to him that is a great waſter: in which reſpect Chriſt ſtileth a ſlothfull ſeruant, 
                     Mat. 25. 26, 30. 
                  a wicked and vnprofitable ſeruant: and giueth him the portion of thoſe who doe much hurt.
               How lightly ſoeuer many ſeruants eſteeme idleneſſe and ſloth, the truth is, that it is a plaine theft. For the beſt ſeruice that ſeruants can doe, is due to their maſter: and they ought to be as diligent in their maſters worke, as if it were their owne. So as it is not enough to auoid idleneſſe in doing nothing at all, but they muſt take heed that they be not ſlothfull in doing ſomething: for as good not at all, as neuer a whit the better.
               
               I haue the further preſſed this point, becauſe it is noted as a blemiſh in ſuch ſeruants as profeſſe religion to be moſt lazie and negligent, leaſt ſedulous and diligent. Much of that time which they ſhould ſpend about their maſters buſineſſe (which is their

particular calling) they ſpend in prating about ſtate, and Church-buſineſſe, (matters not belonging to them.) Thus they make their maſters weary of their ſeruice; and by reaſon thereof they are oft ſhifted from houſe to houſe, and as rolling ſtones, gather no moſſe: they neither learne skill, whereby they may, when they are of themſelues, maintaine themſelues, and doe good to others: nor lay vp any ſtocke or portion, as others which are diligent doe: yea they get ſuch an habit of idleneſſe, as they can neuer ſhake it off againe: for they who are ſlothfull being vnder maſters, ſeldome proue diligent when they are for themſelues. In theſe is Solomons prouerbe verified, The talke of the lips tendeth only to penury.

               §. 25. Of ſeruants faithfulneſſe.
               
               It was §. 23. before noted, that the good will here required of ſeruants to their maſters had reſpect to the profit and benefit which ſeruants by their ſeruice might bring to their maſters: and in that reſpect it compriſeth faithfulneſſe vnder it, Faithfulneſſe (I ſay) whereby ſeruants doe well diſcharge that truſt which is committed to them. Expreſly it is commanded to ſeruants, 
                     Tit. 2. 10. 
                  To ſhew all good faithfulneſſe, and 1 Cor. 4. 2. 
                  it is required in ſtewards that a man be found faithfull. The phraſe which is vſed of Moſes, 
                  
                     Heb. 3. 5. 
                  He was faithfull as a ſeruant, ſheweth that faithfulneſſe by a kinde of proprietie appertaineth to a ſeruant: and 
                     Mat. 25. 21. where Chriſt coupleth theſe two, good and faithfull, he giueth vs to vnderſtand that a ſeruants goodneſſe conſiſteth in his faithfulneſſe.
               
               Great is the benefit that by ſeruants faithfulneſſe will redound both to maſter and ſeruant.
               The benefit which commeth to the maſter, Solomon noteth in this prouerbe, As the cold of ſnow (is very acceptable, comfortable 
                     Pro. 25. 13. and profitable) in the time of harueſt (when men are euen ſweltered with heat) ſo is a faithfull meſſenger to them that ſend him: for he refreſheth the ſoule of his maſters: and againe in this, A faithfull ambaſſadour is health, that is, he bringeth ſafetie to his maſter. 
                     Pro. 13. 17.
               
               The benefit which redoundeth to the ſeruant himſelfe by his faithfulneſſe Chriſt noteth in this his approbation, and remuneration thereof, Well done thou good and faithfull ſeruant, 
                  
                     Mat. 25. 21.
                  
                  thou haſt beene faithfull ouer a few things, I will make thee Ruler ouer many things, enter thou into the ioy of thy Lord. Euery ſeruant ſhall be called to his account: if not by his maſter on earth, yet by his maſter in heauen: he will ſay to euery one, Giue an account of thy ſtewardſhip: now then if ſeruants haue not beene 
                     Luk. 16. 2. faithfull, what other diſcharge can they looke for, then that which the wicked, ſlothfull, and vnprofitable ſeruant (who hid his talent in a napkin) receiued, namely this, Caſt ye the 
                  
                     Mat. 25. 30. 
                  vnprofitable ſeruant into outer darkneſſe, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. Let all vnfaithfull ſeruants note this: for to faithfulneſſe is contrary all vnfaithfulneſſe, as negligence, deceit, theeuery, treachery, and ſuch like vices. Much dammage, diſgrace, and vexation is brought by ſuch ſeruants to maſters: and better it had beene that they neuer had come into a mans houſe.
               But that the point of faithfulneſſe may be the better diſcerned, and obſerued, I will exemplifie it in ſeuen particulars whereabout it ought eſpecially to be exerciſed, which are, 1. The Goods, 2. The Buſineſſes and affaires, 3. The Counſels and ſecrets, 4. The other ſeruants, 5. the Children, 6. The Bedfellow, 7. The Perſon of their maſter or miſtreſſe.
            
            
               §. 26. Of ſeruants faithfulneſſe about their maſters goods.
               
               Two things are required of ſeruants to teſtifie their faithfulneſſe about their maſters goods. 1.
                  
                     1. A ſafe keeping of them.
                     2. An increaſing of them.
                  
               
               1. Whatſoeuer is committed by maſters vnto their ſeruants, they muſt ſo carefully preſerue, as it be not loſt, ſpoiled, or impaired Seruants muſt well preſerue their maſters goods. vnder their hands, whether they be things within doores, or without. I may to this purpoſe not vnfitly apply that charge vnto ſeruants which in another caſe the Apoſtle gaue to Timothy, 
                  1 Tim. 6. 20. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  Keepe that which is committed to thy truſt: the Metaphor is taken from ſeruants, and ſo ſheweth what is their dutie. Great was Ioſephs faithfulneſſe in this kinde, which made his maſter 
                     Gen. 39. 4. 
                  put all that he had into his hand. So great was Iackobs faithfulneſſe, that 
                     & 31. 38, 39. in twentie yeeres his maſters ewes and ſhe Goats, being vnder his hand, caſt not their young, nor the Rammes were deuoured: if any thing were torne of

beaſts, he brought it not to his maſter, but bare the loſſe of it himſelfe. If ſeruants eſpie any dammage or hurt done by others to their maſters goods, they muſt redreſſe it, if they can, or at leaſt make it knowne to their maſters, that he may giue order for the redreſſing of it: as the ſeruants of him that ſowed good ſeed among which tares were ſowed, mentioned 
                     Mat. 13. 27. in the parable.
               Maſters that put ſeruants in truſt, ſecurely goe about other affaires, and looke not themſelues to thoſe goods which are vnder their ſeruants cuſtodie, which is to be preſuppoſed they would doe, if they truſted not their ſeruants. Great reaſon therefore it is that ſeruants be carefull of thoſe things which are ſo committed to them.
               2. They ought further to doe what lieth in them to aduance Seruants muſt endeuour to increaſe their maſters eſtate. Gen. 30. 30. Mat. 25. 16, 17. their maſters eſtate, and to increaſe his ſtocke. The little which Laban had was by Iaakobs faithfulneſſe in this kinde increaſed vnto a multitude. The talents which were committed to the two faithfull ſeruants were by their induſtrie increaſed to as many more. So as it is not ſufficient for ſeruants not to impaire their maſters eſtate, but they muſt better it: for he that kept ſafe his maſters talent, and gaue him his owne againe, was counted an vnprofitable ſeruant, and receiued the doome of waſters.
               Moſt maſters take ſeruants for their aduantage and benefit, for it is but little eaſe for a maſter to prouide diet and lodging for many ſeruants, and to giue them wages, if they reape no profit and benefit by them.
            
            
               §. 27. Of ſeruants careleſneſſe ouer their maſters goods.
               
               Contrary to ſeruants fidelitie in ſafe keeping their maſters goods committed to their charge is Careleſneſſe and negligence in ſuffering loſſe and dammage come to their maſters as in the fields, when they looke not to his ſences and gats: or neglect his cattell ſo as they be ſtolne, or ſuffer diſeaſes to grow vpon them, or giue them not fodder and water in due ſeaſon. Or in the houſe, when they leaue doores or windowes open, and theeues come in and take away, or hooke out their maſters goods: or careleſly leaue the fire, or let candles burne

ſo as the houſe may be ſee on fire: or ſuffer houſhold-ſtuffe, and apparell to lie till it be moth-eaten or otherwiſe ſpoiled: or ſuffer any thing in the houſe to be broken: or victuall to lie in corners moulding, or to be caſt vp and downe for dogs and cats. When Chriſt ſo increaſed the bread and fiſh, wherewith many thouſands were fed, that many fragments were left, he bid his diſciples gather vp what remained, and rendred this reaſon, that nothing be loſt. The dammage which may come by 
                     Iohn 6. 12. ſeruants careleſneſſe, may be more then euer they can be able to make ſatisfaction for: and therefore they ought the more carefully to preuent it.
            
            
               §. 28. Of ſeruants fraud.
               
               Contrary to the other branch of ſeruants faithfulneſſe in increaſing their maſters eſtate, is all manner of theft and fraud, whether it be by retaining that which is due to their maſters, or by purloining from them that which they haue. 
                     Tit. 2. 10. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . The Apoſtle expreſly forbiddeth ſeruants to purloine. The word tranſlated purloine, is the ſame whereby the fraud of Ananias is ſet forth, who 
                     Acts 5. 2. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  kept backe part of the price of a poſſeſſion which they ſold: ſo as thereby is forbidden not only open and manifeſt ſtealth, as pilfering money out of their maſters purſe, cheſt, or counter; or conueying away their corne, wares, or any other goods: but alſo putting more into the account of expences then hath beene expended, or into the account of debts leſſe then is due (as the vniuſt ſteward, who for a debt of an hundred meaſures of oyle put in fiftie, and for an hundred of 
                     Luke 16. 6, 7. wheat put in foureſcore) or ſpending more then needs, or bringing in ill company into the houſe when their maſters are abſent, and entertaining them on their maſters coſt, or concealing part of the price which hath beene taken for any wares, or borowing money in their maſters names, or taking greater fees then their maſters wot of, or receiuing bribes or gifts which their maſters refuſe (as Gehazi) or hiring others to doe their worke vpon their maſters coſt, or inueagling away their maſters 2 King. 5. 22. cuſtomers, or purloining away other mens goods committed to their maſters truſt (as Taylors ſeruants, who thereby both much diſcredit their maſters, and alſo hinder their cuſtome.)
               
                  
                  
                     Obiect. What if maſters detaine their ſeruants wages? may they not by priuy meanes right themſelues?
                  
                     Anſw. A maſters ſinne is no warrant to make ſeruants anſwer ſinne with ſinne. The law is as open for ſeruants as for maſters: if not, Gods eares are open for their complaints: he can and will redreſſe all, or here or hereafter. 
                        Gen. 31. 42. Note Iaakobs example. Many make this a iuſt pretence: but whether it be iuſt or no, it is not ſafe to open this gap of deceit.
                  Theſe and ſuch like kindes of deceit are the more hainous ſinnes becauſe of that truſt which maſters repoſe in ſeruants: for they violate both the bond of iuſtice, and of fidelity alſo. If a ſeruant imbezill or defraud his maſter of any of his 21. Of Hen. 8. Stat. 7. And 5. of Eliz. Stat. 10. goods to the value of forty ſhillings, he is adiudged a felon by our ſtatute law.
               
            
            
               §. 29. Of ſeruants faithfulneſſe in the buſineſſes which they are to diſpatch for their maſters.
               
               In the buſineſſes which maſters commit to the care of II. their ſeruants to be diſpatched by them, they muſt doe their beſt endeuour that all may proſper vnder their hands: as it is noted of Ioſeph, 
                  
                     Gen. 39. 2. 
                  he was a proſperous man: we haue not only a pregnant proofe, but alſo an excellent direction for this point, in the 
                     Gen. 24. example of Abrahams ſeruant, who was very faithfull in diſpatching the buſineſſe of fetching a wife for Iſaak: therein let theſe particulars be noted.
               1. He feared God: the whole cariage of that buſineſſe teſtifieth as much. There is a double bond to tie ſeruants hereunto: one in reſpect of themſelues, that in the thing which they doe they may be accepted of God: another in reſpect of their maſters, that their maſters buſineſſe may proſper vnder their hands: God proſpereth ſuch as feare him, in all things they take in hand: inſtance the examples of 
                     Gen. 30. 27. 
                  Iaakob, 
                  
                     & 39. 2. 
                  Ioſeph, and 1 Sam. 18. 14. 
                  Dauid.
               
               2. He 
                     Gen. 24. 12. called vpon God to proſper his endeuours: now prayer is the beſt meanes that poſſibly can be vſed to obtaine any bleſſing from the Lord. Without it all our endeuours are vaine (
                     Pſal. 127. 2. 
                  It is in vaine to riſe vp early and ſit vp late, and to eat the bread of carefulneſſe, except Gods bleſſing accompany all.)
               
               3. He 
                     Gen. 24. 27. gaue thankes when he ſaw the Lord begin to proſper

that he tooke in hand: thankſgiuing for the beginning of a bleſſing, is an effectuall meanes for continuance of that bleſſing: yea it is alſo an effectuall meanes to moue God to proſper other things that we take in hand: ſo as, if ſeruants deſire to proſper in all the affaires which they vndertake for their maſters, they muſt render thanks for the firſt ſucceſſe which he hath giuen, and ſo for the ſecond, third, fourth, and for euery ſucceſſe.
               4. He tooke all the opportunities he could: 
                     Gen. 24. 17, 23. when he ſaw a maid to inquire of, he ran to her, and inquired what was behouefull for his matter: when he had ground to thinke ſhe was the maid, 
                     Verſ. 22. he preſented gifts to her: 
                     Verſ. 33. ſo ſoone as he was brought to the houſe, he falls vpon the matter for which he came, euen before he did eat any thing: after matters to his liking were concluded, he maketh no tarrying, but with all ſpeed carieth the maid to Iſaak. In a word, he omitted nothing that in the vttermoſt of his wiſdome he conceiued to be behouefull for that matter: more he could not haue done, if the matter had wholly concerned himſelfe. I ſhall need no further to vrge this point, then by ſetting this patterne before ſeruants.
               Contrary is their diſpoſition who care not whether the things which they doe for their maſter proſper or no: if they haue taken any paines therein, ſo as their maſter cannot ſay they haue altogether neglected it, there is all that they care for. If it ſucceed not well, they will ſay they are not in Gods place to make euery thing which is done to proſper. But though the whole bleſſing reſt in God, yet hath he ſanctified meanes for obtaining his bleſſing (as faith, prayer, thankſgiuing, and the like) which becauſe they vſe not, they faile in this point of faithfulneſſe. Nay further, they vſe thoſe things which doe mainly hinder and keepe away Gods bleſſing, and in ſtead thereof bring a curſe vpon all they do, as profaneneſſe, vncleanneſſe, drunkenneſſe, and all manner of riotouſneſſe, yea deſpiſing Gods word and holy ordinances, reproaching his Saints, taking his name in vaine by ſwearing, forſwearing, and blaſpheming, lying, alſo backbiting, pilfering, and other like vices. Theſe irreligious and wicked ſeruants, as they ſinne

againſt God and their owne ſoules, ſo alſo againſt their maſter: it is not for maſters profit to keepe ſuch ſeruants.
            
            
               §. 30. Of ſeruants faithfulneſſe in keeping their maſters ſecrets, and concealing their infirmities.
               
               By reaſon of that neare bond which is betwixt maſter III. and ſeruants, and their neare and continuall abiding together, and the many imploiments which maſters haue for their ſeruants, ſeruants come to know many of their maſters ſecrets: faithfulneſſe therefore requireth to keepe them cloſe. Prouided that they be not ſuch ſecrets as tend to the diſhonour of God, or to the danger of the Commonwealth and Church, no nor of a priuate perſon: for 1 Sam. 20. 12. 
                  Ionathan is commended for diſcouering the miſchiefe which Saul had ſecretly intended againſt Dauid.
               
               For proofe of the point, note what Solomon ſaith, 
                     Pro. 11. 13. 
                  He that is of a faithfull ſpirit concealeth a matter: namely, a ſecret matter. Note alſo how faithfull 
                     Ier. 38. 27. 
                  Ieremiah was in keeping Zedekiahs counſell: though the Princes enquired after it, yet would he not reueale it to them.
               To this head is to be referred a faithfull concealing of maſters infirmities: for the beſt that be are ſubiect to many: and ſeruants which are vnder their maſters roofe continually waiting on them, cannot chuſe but eſpie many: if herein ſeruants be not faithfull, maſters were better be without ſeruants in their houſes.
               Contrary to keeping cloſe the ſecrets of maſters, is blabbing abroad all ſuch things as ſeruants know concerning their maſters: which is too common a fault: for when ſeruants of diuers houſes men or maids meet together, all their talke for the moſt part is of their maſters and miſtreſſes, whereby it commeth to paſſe that all the ſecrets of an houſe are ſoone knowne about the whole towne or city. Solomon ſtileth ſuch an one a tale-bearer: A tale-bearer, ſaith he, reuealeth ſecrets: or, he that 
                  
                     Pro. 11. 13. & 20. 19. 
                  reuealeth ſecrets is a tale-bearer: for many of Solomons prouerbs are conuertible, they may be turned either way. Now note how Solomon noteth out the miſchiefes that tale-bearers worke: The words of a tale-bearer are as wounds, (they wound the pretious name and credit of a man) and they goe downe into the innermoſt 
                  
                     Pro. 18. 8.
                  
                  part of the belly, that is, they doe, as it were, ſtrike thorow the very heart of a man. Againe he noteth them to be the cauſe of all ſtriſe, and to raiſe diſcord betwixt chiefe friends: and in 
                     Pro. 16. 28. Pro. 26. 20. that reſpect fitly reſembleth them to wood which is the very fuell of fire. What enemies then are ſuch ſeruants to an houſe? They are euen as treacherous ſpies, the moſt dangerous enemies that be. Thus we ſee that this is no light ſinne: yet is it ſo much the more odious when maſters and miſtreſſes infirmities (the publiſhing whereof may much impaire their credit) are made knowne.
            
            
               §. 31. Of ſeruants faithfulneſſe in helping one another.
               
               Where many fellow ſeruants are together, faithfulneſſe requireth that one be helpfull to another in what they may; IV. as by good example, good counſell, incouragement in good courſes, diſſwaſion from lewd and wicked practiſes, peace and vnity, with the like. The Lord Chriſt expreſly calleth ſuch an one a faithfull ſeruant, and pronounceth him bleſſed. 
                  
                     Mat. 24. 45, 46.
               
               Example and aduice of ones equall preuaileth much with another, ſo as a fellow ſeruant may in this kinde doe more good then the maſter himſelfe: and if by his meanes he bring his fellow ſeruants to be faithfull, his owne faithfulneſſe is doubled and trebled; and his maſter receiueth a double and treble benefit thereby: namely the benefit of this good ſeruants faithfulneſſe, and the benefit of all the other ſeruants faithfulneſſe whom he hath made faithfull.
               Contrary is their practiſe who by their ill example corrupt 
                     Mat. 24. 49. their fellowes (as that euill ſeruant, who, when his maſter was away, did eat and drinke with the drunken, that is, did cauſe 
                     Gen. 37. 18, &c.
                   others to be drunken with him) or by ill counſell draw one another on to euill (as the ſonnes of Iaakob, who when they ſaw Ioſeph a farre off, ſaid one to another, Behold this dreamer 
                  
                     Mat. 24. 49. 
                  commeth, come now and let us ſlay him, &c. and as they, who, when they ſaw their maſters ſonne, ſaid among themſelues, This is the heire, come let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his inheritance) or are euer quarrelling with their fellowes, and ſmiting them (as that forenamed euill ſeruant whom the Lord threatneth to cut off) or diſſwade one another from obedience and ſubiection (as they who ſaid, Let us breake their bonds 
                  
                     Pſal 2. 3.
                  
                  aſunder, and caſt away their cords from vs; and as Sheba, who ſaid, we haue no part in Dauid: euery man to his tents O Iſrael.) 
                  2 Sam. 20. 1. Theſe faults are very rife among ſeruants: whence it commeth to paſſe that there are ſo few good, and ſo many bad ſeruants: too true is this prouerbe, One skabbed ſheepe mars a whole flocke. Let there be in a great family one ſeruant that is profane, proud, riotous, ſtout, rebellious, or otherwiſe vicious, and all will ſoone be like him.
               Among other parts of vnfaithfulneſſe in this kinde one of the moſt monſtrous (which yet is too too frequent) is to allure one another to vncleanneſſe, and men and maids to defile one another. We ſhewed §. 11. before, that it was vnlawfull for ſeruants during the time of their ſeruice to marie without their maſters conſent: how abominable then is it to defile one another? The ſinne is doubled being betwixt ſeruants: for as it is a beaſtly ſin in it ſelfe, ſo in the forenamed reſpect it is greatly diſhonourable to their maſter and his houſe: beſides that the maid ſo defiled is oft diſabled to doe her ſeruice well: nay many times the charge of the childe lieth vpon the maſter. Thus ſhame and diſhonour, griefe and vexation, loſſe and dammage all meet together, the more to gall & pierce him to the very heart. Is not this then a great part of vnfaithfulneſſe? Deſerueth it not to be ſeuerely puniſhed, and that openly, and publikely with ſhame and ſmart too, tht others may take warning thereby? Many vſe meanes to eſcape the reuenging hand of man: but though they eſcape mans hand, they ſhall be ſure to meet with Gods heauy vengeance: whoremongers God will iudge. Daily experience ſheweth what miſery 
                     Heb. 13. 4. ſuch wretches bring themſelues vnto, and how God meeteth with them, and that moſt fearefully.
            
            
               §. 32. Of ſeruants faithfulneſſe about their maſters children.
               
               Great faithfulneſſe may ſeruants manifeſt to their maſters V. in and about their children: as while they are young and not able to looke to themſelues, to be tender ouer them, and well to tend them: maids eſpecially neatly to handle and looke to them, and cleanly to bring them vp: and they that haue a particular charge of them, to ſeeke their good in euery thing they can, and giue them their due portion: and (becauſe

children are much in ſeruants company) to vſe in their hearing ſuch ſpeech as may miniſter grace to them, and to teach them good things, and (when they grow to ſome ripeneſſe of yeares) to beare a reuerend reſpect to them, and eſteeme them their betters becauſe they are their maſters children. It is noted of Abrahams ſeruant, that he called his maſters 
                     Gen. 24. 65. ſonne, Maſter.
               
               Children are deare to parents: the honour and kindneſſe done to them they account as done to themſelues: this kinde of faithfulneſſe therefore muſt needs be highly eſteemed by maſters in their ſeruants: and aſſuredly it is a great meanes to worke a good reſpect in maſters towards them.
               Yet Contrarily doe many ſeruants carrie themſelues towards Points of vnfaithfulneſſe in ſeruants about their maſters children. their maſters children, as is apparent by theſe particulars.
               1. Some in their cariage are very hoggiſh and churliſh to their maſters children when their parents are out of ſight.
               2. Others are very careleſſe of them, and tend them very ſluttiſhly, not caring how they goe: whereby they oft procure great diſpleaſure from their maſter and miſtreſſe.
               3. Others get from their maſters children what they can: and depriue them of their allowance, turning it to their owne gaine.
               4. Others exceedingly corrupt their maſters children with their filthy and corrupt communication: teaching them to ſweare, blaſpheme, and vſe all manner of vncleane ſpeeches: thus is that prouerbe verified, euill communications 
                  1 Cor. 15. 33. 
                  corrupt good manners. Children oft times in their young yeeres learne ſuch ill language and behauiour of lewd ſeruants, as their parents can neuer get them to leaue againe: ſo as they may curſe the day that euer ſuch ſeruants came into their houſe.
               5. Others allure them to ſtage-plaies, to dice-houſes, and other like places, which are the very bane of youth: and draw them to ſpend in riot ſuch allowance as their parents allow them, yea and beyond that allowance, ſo as they runne in debt, and get ſuch an habit of ſpending, as at length they make away their whole eſtate.
               
                  
6. Others inueagle their affections: and oft draw them to folly and vncleanneſſe. This filthy kinde of vnfaithfulneſſe is ſo much worſe then that which was §. 31. before noted betwixt fellow ſeruants, by how much neerer and dearer children are to their parents then ſeruants to their maſters.
               7. Others that dare not commit this abominable wickedneſſe, ſticke not to doe that which is little better, namely to draw them on to be contracted, yea and maried to them often times, and that priuily without conſent of their parents: whereby parents affections are oft ſo alienated from their children, as they will not acknowledge them for children, but cleane caſt them off. Theſe are the fruits of this lewd kinde of vnfaithfulneſſe in ſeruants.
            
            
               §. 33. Of ſeruants faithfulneſſe in regard of their maſters, or miſtreſſes bed-fellow.
               
               So faithfull ought ſeruants to be to their maſters and VI. miſtreſſes, that if one of them ſhould labour to vſe a ſeruant in any manner of deceit to the other, the ſeruant ought not to yeeld. As if a maſter ſhould moue his maid priuily to take away iewels, plate, mony, linnen, or any ſuch thing as is in her miſtreſſe cuſtody. It skilleth not that the maſter hath the chiefeſt power ouer all the goods: a ſecret taking of them away without the priuity of the miſtreſſe in whoſe cuſtody they are, is in the ſeruant deceit, and a point of vnfaithfulneſſe. Much leſſe ought any ſeruants be moued by their miſtreſſe priuily to take away their maſters corne, wares, or any goods for her priuate vſe. Of the two this is the greater part of vnfaithfulneſſe.
               If ſuch deceit ought not to be vſed about any goods, much leſſe about the body of maſter or miſtreſſe. As if a maſter ſhould allure his maid to commit folly with him, or a miſtreſſe her man, both their conſcience to God, and alſo their faithfulneſſe to their maſter or miſtreſſe ſhould make them vtterly to refuſe it, and to giue no place to any ſuch temptation. 
                     Gen. 39. 7. &c.
                   
                  Ioſeph is propounded as a patterne herein: and againſt the ſuggeſtion of his miſtreſſe he rendreth the two forenamed reaſons: his conſcience to God in theſe words, how can I doe this great wickedneſſe and ſinne againſt God? His faithfulneſſe

to his maſter in theſe, He hath not kept backe any thing from me but thee, how then &c.
               To this head may be referred ſeruants faithfulneſſe in making knowne to their maſter the ſinne of his wife, and to their miſtreſſe the ſinne of her husband, eſpecially if it be ſuch a ſinne as may tend to the ruine of the familie, and that by the knowledge thereof, the party that is not blinded and beſotted with the ſinne, but rather free from it, may be a meanes to redreſſe it. Thus 1 Sam. 25. 14. 
                  Nabals ſeruants made knowne to Abigail the churliſhneſſe of Nabal towards Dauids ſeruants: by which means the miſchiefe intended againſt the houſe was preuented. Thus if ſeruants know that their maſter intendeth ſome mortall reuenge againſt another, to tell his wife thereof in time, may be great faithfulneſſe: or if they know their miſtreſſe hath appointed to goe away priuily from her husband, to tell him of it, is a part of faithfulneſſe. This may be applied to many other like caſes.
               The contrary is yeelding to maſters or miſtreſſes in any point of deceit one againſt another: whereunto ſeruants are too prone, becauſe they thinke to be boulſtred out by the authoritie of the partie that ſetteth them on worke to deceiue. But no authoritie can be a warrant for any deceit, or wickedneſſe.
            
            
               §. 34. Of ſeruants faithfulneſſe about their maſters perſons.
               
               Maſters and Miſtreſſes are fleſh and bloud as well as ſeruants, VII. and ſo ſubiect to weakneſſe, ſickneſſe, old age, and other diſtreſſes, wherein they may ſtand in great need of ſeruants helpe: ſeruants therefore muſt be faithfull in affording them the beſt helpe that they can. Sauls ſeruants did a part of faithfulneſſe to their maſter, when, he being vexed with an euill ſpirit, 1 Sam. 16. 16. they inquired after meanes to eaſe him. So did Dauids ſeruants, when he being bedred, 1 King. 1. 2. they ſought out one to cheriſh him. It was a point of faithfulneſſe in Naamans 
                  2 King. 5. 3. maid, to tell her miſtreſſe of a meanes whereby her maſter might be cured of his leproſie: and in his 
                     verſ. 13. ſeruants, to perſwade him to vſe the meanes preſcribed by the Prophet.
               Contrary is a ſeruants vngratefull and inhumane leauing of his maſter in his time of need, as the ſeruants of Iob did: for when the hand of God lay heauy vpon him, and all his goods were taken from him, and his bodie full of ſore boiles, 
                     Iob 19. 15, 16. 
                  they that dwelt
                  
                  in his houſe, and his maids counted him for a ſtranger: and he was an aliant in their ſight: he called his ſeruant, and he gaue him no anſwer. So did 2 Sam. 19. 26. 
                  Ziba leaue Mephiboſheth in his greateſt need: and 
                     Mat. 26. 56. the Diſciples flie from their maſter Ieſus Chriſt. But what ſhall we ſay of thoſe that take occaſion from their maſters impotencie to murder him themſelues, as 2 Sam. 4. 6. 
                  Rechab and Baanah; or to betray him to his enemies, as 
                     Mat. 26. 15. 
                  Indas betrayed the Lord Chriſt? what, but that ſuch traiterous ſeruants may looke for ſuch ends.

               Among many other meanes to make ſeruants faithfull to their maſter, and carefull to performe other duties ſincerely, willingly, cheerefully, and diligently, as hath before beene noted, this is one of the moſt generall, namely, that ſeruants, in all things they doe for their maſter, make their maſters caſe their owne, and ſo doe for him as they would for themſelues, or as they would haue their owne ſeruants doe for them. The generall rule of the Law is, 
                     Leu. 19. 18. 
                  Loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe; and 
                     Mat. 7. 12. 
                  whatſoeuer you would that men ſhould doe to you, doe you even ſo to them. If thus euery man muſt reſpect another, yea though he be a ſtranger, then much more muſt ſeruants reſpect their maſter, becauſe all that they can doe is after an eſpeciall manner as a debt due to their maſters: in which reſpect Chriſt ſaith, that when they haue done all that is 
                  
                     Luke 17. 10. 
                  commanded, they haue but done their dutie.
               
               This I haue the rather noted, becauſe the practiſe of moſt ſeruants is contrary thereunto. For while they worke for their maſters, they will cry out that they are ouer-burdened, and tired with that worke which they will eaſily goe thorow withall when they worke for themſelues. They that while they worke for their maſter, muſt be called to it againe and againe, and forced to ſtand to it, and to hold out till it be done, what paines will they take, how early will they riſe, how late will they ſit vp, how diligent will they be for themſelues? When Iourneymen receiue increaſe of wages according to the worke which they doe, they will diſpatch more then a prentiſe that hath but cloth, food, and lodging. Againe, many that in their maſters goods are very lauiſh, and waſtfull, when they come to befor themſelues are very ſparing, ſauing, and prouident. What doe theſe things argue but that ſeruants doe not beare to their maſters that minde which they

ſhould: they doe not for them as they would doe for themſelues. Very requiſite it is therefore that the forenamed generall rule be obſerued.
               Hitherto of the ſeuerall kindes of ſeruants duties, and of the manner of performing them. It remaineth to ſpeake both of the extent of their duties, and alſo of the reſtraint of that extent.
            
            
               §. 36. Of ſeruants endeuour to make their iudgement agree with their maſters.
               
               The extent of ſeruants duties is in my text only implied vnder this indefinite particle (Obey) (wch being not reſtrained to any particulars, muſt be extended to euery thing) but in other places it is expreſly laid downe in theſe generall termes, 
                     Col. 3. 22. 
                  Obey in all things, 
                  
                     Tit. 2. 9. 
                  Pleaſe well in all things. It is not therefore ſufficient that ſeruants performe their duties well in ſome things, they muſt doe it in all things, yea in things that may be againſt their owne minde and liking, if their maſter will haue it ſo. For this end let ſeruants note theſe two rules. The ſame extent and reſtraint Extent of ſeruants duties. that was Treat. 3. §. 63, &c. & Treat. 5. §. 35. before noted in laying forth the duties of other inferiors, is here alſo to be obſerued in the duties of ſeruants: for therein they all agree. The ſame rules therfore that were before ſet downe, may here againe be applied. I refer the reader to thoſe places for a more large amplification of the generals: and here I will content my ſelfe with adding ſuch particular proofes as are moſt proper and pertinent to ſeruants.
               1. That they labour to bring their iudgement to the bent of their maſters iudgement, and to thinke that meet and good which Seruants muſt labour to bring their iudgement to agree with their maſters. he doth. Thus the 
                     Iudg. 19. 11, 12, &c.
                   ſeruant of the Leuire which thought it meeteſt to turne into one of the Cities of the Iebuſites to lodge there, becauſe the day was far ſpent, when he ſaw his maſter to be of another minde, yeelded to him. So did 
                     Luk. 19. 25, &c.
                   thoſe ſeruants yeeld to their maſter, who at firſt thought it vnmeet that he that had ten talents ſhould haue one peece more: and 
                     Mat. 13. 28, &c.
                   thoſe ſeruants alſo, that at firſt thought it meet that the tares ſhould be plucked vp from the wheat. This rule is to be obſerued in the particular points before deliuered, as the worke which ſeruants doe, and the manner

of doing it, their apparell, their allowance, yea and in the correction which their maſter giueth them, and the reſt.
               Contrary is that great conceit which many ſeruants haue of Seruants conceit of their owne wit. their owne iudgement, wit, and wiſdome, thinking themſelues wiſer then their maſters; as Gehazi, who oppoſing his owne wit to his maſters wiſdome, ſaid, 2 King. 5. 20. 
                  Behold my maſter hath ſpared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiuing at his hands that which he brought: but as the Lord liueth, I will runne after him, and take ſomewhat of him. This was alſo a fault in 2 King. 2. 16. the children of the Prophets, that would not reſt on Eliſhas iudgement, but importuned him againſt his minde to ſend ſome to ſeeke the bodie of Eliah. This ſelfe-conceit is the cauſe of many miſchiefes: as of diſcontentedneſſe at the worke their maſter appointeth them, and at the allowance of meat and drinke which they haue; of much libertie they take to themſelues, of pride in apparell, and other vices before noted: if the forenamed rule were duely obſerued, many of thoſe miſchiefes would be auoided, and much better obedience yeelded.
            
            
               §. 37. Of ſeruants yeelding to doe ſuch things at their maſters command, as they cannot thinke to be moſt meet.
               
               The ſecond rule which ſeruants muſt obſerue is this, that
               
                  Though they cannot in their iudgement thinke that fit to be done which their maſter will haue done, yet vpon his peremptorie command they muſt yeeld to the doing of it: It appeareth by Peters anſwer to Chriſt that he did ſo, for being commanded to let downe his net for a draught, thus he anſwereth, Maſter, we haue toyled all the night, and haue taken nothing (here he ſheweth that 
                     Luke 5. 5. his opinion was that it would be in vaine to let downe their nets) neuertheleſſe at thy word I will let downe the net (here is his obedience againſt his opinion.) More cleare is the example of Ioab for this purpoſe: when the King commanded him to number the 2 Sam. 24. 2, &c.
                   people, he declared that he thought it a very vnmeet thing to doe, by this phraſe, Why doth my Lord the King delight in this thing? yet againſt his iudgement he yeelded to the Kings peremptorie command, for it is ſaid, that the Kings word preuailed against Ioab.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. This is no fit example, becauſe Ioab ſinned in obeying.
                  
                     Anſw. Ioab cannot iuſtly be charged with ſinne, becauſe it was

not ſimply vnlawfull to number the people. Dauids ſinne was not in the act of numbring the people, but in his minde which moued him to doe it: for there was no iuſt cauſe to doe it: only pride and curioſitie moued him, as may be gathered out of his owne reaſon in theſe words, that I may know the number of the people. To doe ſuch a thing only to know it, was curioſitie. But why would he know it? ſurely on a proud conceit that he had ſo many worthies, ſo many Captaines, ſo many men of warre.
                  Out of Ioabs example ſeruants may here learne in humilitie and reuerence to render ſome reaſons to moue their maſter not to preſſe vpon them that which they thinke to be vnmeet; but yet if their maſter will not hearken to their reaſons, but ſtand vpon his authoritie, his word muſt preuaile.
                  
                  Contrary is their peremptorineſſe, who by no meanes will be drawne to doe any thing at their maſters command, which they themſelues thinke not moſt meet to be done. Such an one is that foole whom Solomon thus deſcribeth, Though thou ſhouldeſt 
                     
                        Pro. 27. 22. 
                     bray a foole in a morter among wheat with a peſtle, yet will not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him. Theſe fooles bring much miſchiefe vpon their owne pates in diſobeying their maſters: for exceedingly they prouoke his wrath who hath power to take vengeance of them. Neither let them thinke to receiue comfort in their ſuffering, becauſe they refuſe an vnmeet thing, for meetneſſe is not a ſufficient warrant againſt vnlawfulneſſe. To diſobey in a thing which lawfully may be done, is vnlawfull: if therefore the pretext be only an vnmeet thing, meetneſſe is preferred before lawfulneſſe, and vnlawfulneſſe leſſe accounted of then vnmeetneſſe.
               
            
            
               §. 38. Of ſeruants forbearing to obey their maſter againſt God.
               
               That the extent of ſeruants obedience be not too farre ſtretched, Reſtraint of the extent of ſeruants duties the Apoſtle ſetteth downe an excellent limitation thereof: and that in theſe foure phraſes, As vnto Chriſt, As the ſeruants of Chriſt, Doing the will of God, As to the Lord; all which doe ſhew that the Obedience which ſeruants yeeld to their maſter 
                  See the cautions, Treat. 3. §. 51, 52, &c. 
                  muſt be ſuch as may ſtand with their obedience to Chriſt. So that if maſters command their ſeruants neuer ſo peremptorily to

doe any vnlawfull thing, that is, any thing forbidden by Gods 
                     Nolite fieri ſerui hominum, i. nolite eis parere cùm turpia praecipiunt. Chryſ. in 1 Cor. 7. hom. 19. Exo. 1. 17. word, they may not yeeld to it. The midwiues of the Hebrew women did well in refuſing to doe any thing to helpe forward the murderous practiſes of the King of Egypt in ſlaying all the male-children of the Hebrewes: it is expreſly ſaid, that they feared God and did not as the King commanded them: ſo as their diſobedience in this kinde was a token of their feare of God. In this caſe Ioſeph is commended for not hearkening to his miſtreſſe: and the ſeruants of Saul for refuſing to ſlaie the 
                     Gen. 39. 9. 1 Sam. 22. 17. Lords Prieſts at their maſters command. Thus if a maſter ſhould command his ſeruant to kill, to ſteale, to forſweare himſelfe, to lie, to vſe falſe meaſures and weights, to goe to maſſe, or doe any other vnlawfull thing, he ought not obey him.
               Againe, if maſters forbid their ſeruants to doe that which Seruis competit vt obediant dominis in ijs quibus mandato Dei nihil derogatur. Baſil. God hath commanded them to doe, they muſt, notwithſtanding their maſters prohibition, doe it. The Rulers of Iſrael forbid the Apoſtles to preach, yet becauſe Chriſt had commanded them to preach, they would not forbeare: nor would Daniel forbeare to pray to God, though the King and Nobles 
                     Ethic. defin. 75. Act. 4. 19. Dan. 6. 10. by expreſſe decree forbad him. So if a profane or popiſh maſter ſhall forbid his ſeruant to goe to Church, or to heare the word, or to take the Sacrament, or to dwell with his wife if he be maried, or to make reſtitution of that which he hath fraudulently gotten, or any other bounden dutie, herein they muſt ſay, we ought to obey God rather then men. For when maſters 
                     Act. 5. 29. command and forbid any thing againſt God, they goe beyond their commiſſion, and therein their authoritie ceaſeth.
               Contrary to this reſtraint is both a paraſiticall pleaſing of maſters: and alſo a baſe feare of them. It is the property of a Ais? aio. Negas? nego. Terent. in Eun. paraſite to ſay what a maſter will haue him ſay, and denie what he will haue him denie, and ſo to doe what he will haue him to doe. Doeg that fawning dog at Sauls word ſlew all the Lords 1 Sam. 22. 18. Prieſts: and Abſoloms ſeruants at his word killed Amnon: for 2 Sam. 13. 28, 29. all the reaſon which they had to commit that murder was this ſpeech of their maſter, haue not I commanded you? So prone are ſeruants to ſooth their maſters, as there is no ſinne ſo horrible which at their maſters command they will not be ready to

doe. Thus is that verified which the Prophet long ſince foretold, 
                     Iſa. 24 2. 
                  like maſter like ſeruant, like mistreſſe like maid. It is alſo the propertie of baſe fearefull ſeruants to doe nothing but what their maſter will haue them doe, and to forbeare any dutie, though neuer ſo neceſſary, that he forbiddeth them to doe. What dutie more neceſſary then praier? We are commanded to pray continually: yet the ſeruants of Darius were content to 1 Theſſ. 5. 17. Dan. 6. 7, &c.
                   forbeare that dutie thirtie daies together, becauſe it was againſt the decree of their Lord and King. The like is noted of the people in Chriſts time, they durſt not make open profeſſion of 
                  
                     Ioh. 7. 13. & 9. 22. 
                  Chriſt for feare of the Iewes. So in our daies many ſeruants there be that dare not make profeſſion of the Goſpell, nor goe to Church, nor read the word, nor performe other holy religious duties, which they know to be bounden duties, for feare of their maſters. Had not then the Apoſtle iuſt cauſe to ſtrike ſo much vpon this ſtring as here he hath done, expreſly forbidding eie-ſeruice, man-pleaſing, and doing ſeruice to men, namely in oppoſition to God?
            
            
               §. 39. Of ſeruants chuſing good maſters.
               
               As a iuſt conſequence following from the forenamed extent and reſtraint of ſeruants duties, I may further gather theſe two leſſons for ſeruants.
               1. It is very behouefull that ſeruants make choice of good maſters: at leaſt if it be in their power to chuſe.
               2. It is behouefull that they continue and abide vnder good maſters: at leaſt if they continue ſeruants, and abide vnder any maſters.
               That theſe conſequences iuſtly follow as aforeſaid, is euident: for ſeeing ſeruants are bound to obey in all things which are not againſt God, and muſt obey in nothing but what is in the Lord, it is very requiſite that ſeruants be vnder ſuch maſters as beare the Image of God in the inward diſpoſition, and grace of their heart, as well as in their outward function and place: and will goe along with God in vſing their authoritie, commanding nothing but what a ſeruant may doe with a good conſcience, and without tranſgreſſing againſt God: and forbidding nothing that God hath bound a ſeruant to doe. There will be comfort in ſeruing ſuch maſters: and our obedience

to them will be obedience to God. Such maſters therefore muſt be choſen. Yea and with ſuch muſt ſeruants abide, (if not with the very ſame, yet with ſuch as they are, of the ſame diſpoſition) for if they goe to other, their former comfort will be taken away, and their ſeruitude will ſeeme ſo much the more miſerable, by how much more knowledge and experience they haue had of the benefit of their former libertie (for Qui fidelem habet dominum, ſaluo eius dominio, diligat vt patrem. we may well call ſeruice vnder vnconſcionable maſters ſeruitude, and in oppoſition thereunto, ſeruice vnder religious maſters, libertie.) He therefore that hath a maſter that is faithfull, due reſpect had to his authoritie, muſt loue him as a father, and 
                     Conſtit. Apoſt. l. 4. c. 12. ſo abide with him.
               For choice of good maſters, note what is 
                     Exo. 12. 38. recorded of many of the Egyptians and other people: they left their owne countrie, and went out with the Iſraelites: what ſhould moue them but conſcience of the true God whom they knew that Iſrael ſerued? Now many of theſe went out as ſeruants, as may be gathered from thoſe many 
                     Leu. 25. 45. Deut. 5. 14. & 12. 18. & 23. 15. & 23. 7. lawes which were made in the behalfe of ſeruants that were ſtrangers, and in ſpeciall that were Egyptians. The knowledge which 
                     Ruth 1. 16. 
                  Ruth had that Naomi her mother in law ſerued the true God, moued her to leaue her owne countrie, and to goe as a ſeruant with Naomi.
               
               For abiding with good maſters we haue a worthy patterne in the twelue Diſciples. 
                     Ioh. 6. 66. &c.
                   When many of Chriſts Diſciples at large, went backe, and walked no more with him, Chriſt asking the twelue whether they alſo would goe away, Peter in the name of all the reſt anſwered, Lord to whom ſhall we goe? Thou haſt the words of eternall life.
               
               Contrary is the minde and practiſe of many ſeruants: they neuer inquire after the religious diſpoſition of their maſter, nor care though he be popiſh, or profane, ſo they may haue good wages, diet and lodging: and yet by this meanes, if at leaſt there be any ſparke of Gods feare in their heart, they caſt themſelues vpon many ſore temptations, and bring themſelues into many hard ſtraits, and dangerous ſnares. And, if God open their eies to ſee that wretched condition whereinto they haue implunged themſelues, they will be forced to crie out and

complaine as Dauid did, when he was in forraine countries where he could not freely ſerue his God, 
                     Pſal. 120. 5. 
                  Woe is me that I ſoiourne in Meſech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar.
               
               Much more contrary is their minde and diſpoſition who refuſe to ſerue religious maſters, and ſhun them moſt of all: or being in their ſeruice are neuer quiet till they be out of it againe. Of theſe we ſpake §. 16. before.
               Hitherto haue we dealt about ſeruants duties. The reaſons which the Apoſtle rendreth to enforce thoſe duties remaine to be declared.
            
            
               §. 40. Of the firſt motiue, the place of maſters.
               
               The firſt reaſon which the Apoſtle vſeth to inforce ſeruants I. duties is implied vnder this phraſe, as to Chriſt; it intimateth the place of a maſter, which is to be in Chriſts ſtead. In this reſpect the title Lord is giuen to a maſter. The word which the Apoſtle vſeth in Greeke is that which in the new teſtament 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . anſwereth to that proper Hebrew name of God Iehouah, and it ſetteth forth the abſolute ſoueraignty of God, and power ouer all creatures: 
                     Matt. 28. 18. which power Becauſe the Father hath giuen to his ſonne as Mediator, God-man, he is called the 1 Cor. 8. 6. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  one or only Lord: and becauſe maſters by vertue of their office and place beare Chriſts image, and ſtand in his ſtead, by communication of Chriſts authority to them, they are called Lords, yea alſo 
                     Pſal. 82. 6. 
                  Gods (for that which a Magiſtrate is in the Common-wealth a maſter is in the family)
               Hence it followeth that ſeruants in performing duty to their maſter performe duty to Chriſt, and in rebelling againſt their maſter they rebell againſt Chriſt; as the Lord ſaid to Samuel of the peoples reiecting his gouernment, they haue not reiected 
                  1 Sam. 8. 7. 
                  thee, but they haue reiected me that I ſhould not raigne ouer them. Is not this a ſtrong motiue to prouoke ſeruants to all duty, and to reſtraine them from rebellion? if it be well weighed what Chriſt is, it cannot be but a weighty reaſon. For though maſters ſhould neither reward their good ſeruice, nor reuenge their ill ſeruice, yet will Chriſt doe both.
            
            
               
               §. 41. Of the ſecond motiue, the place of ſeruants.
               
               The ſecond reaſon is implied vnder this phraſe, as ſeruants 
                  II. 
                  of Chriſt: it noteth the place of a ſeruant: which though it may ſeeme to be a meane and baſe place, yet is it indeed an honourable place. Men count it an honour to bee ſeruants to a King: but Chriſt is higher then all Kings. On this ground the Apoſtle ſaith, Art thou called being a ſeruant? care not for it: 
                  1 Cor. 7. 21, 22. and that vpon this reaſon, He that is called in the Lord being a ſeruant, is the Lords freeman. This reaſon is to be noted againſt the conceit that moſt haue of a ſeruants place, that it is ſo meane and baſe as there can be no honour nor comfort in doing the duties thereof. But that is a fooliſh, and vniuſt conceit: looke to Chriſt the higheſt maſter, and there is as much honour, and comfort in doing the duties of the loweſt ſeruants place, as of the higheſt maſters.
            
            
               §. 42. Of the third motiue, Gods will.
               
               The third reaſon is implied vnder this phraſe, doing the 
                  III. 
                  will of God, which declareth the ground of ſeruants ſubiection. God in his word hath plainly made it knowne that it is his pleaſure that they who are vnder the authority of maſters ſhould obey them, therefore as ſeruants would pleaſe God, they muſt obey: if they refuſe to obey, they thwart the will of God. This alſo is a motiue of moment: for Gods will is that marke which euery one ought to aime at, and it is much vrged by the Holy Ghoſt, as a generall reaſon to all duty in theſe and ſuch like phraſes, 1 Theſ. 4. 3. 
                  This is the will of God, 
                  1 Pet. 2. 15. 
                  So is the will of God: vpon which ground we are exhorted to 
                     Ephef. 5. 17. 
                  vnderſtand, and to 
                     Rom. 12. 2. 
                  proue what is the will of God.
               
               Good reaſon there is to preſſe this reaſon: for
               1. Gods will is the very ground of goodneſſe: things are therefore good becauſe they are agreeable to Gods will: Gods will giueth the very being to goodneſſe.
               2. Gods will is a rule to ſquare all our actions by, euen as the kings ſtatutes and proclamations are to his ſubiects.
               3. It is a perfect rule (the law of the Lord is perfect) ſo as we 
                     Pſal. 19. 7. may be ſure not to ſwerue, if we hold cloſe thereunto.
               
                  
4. It is a ſufficient rule, it will giue euery one (and among other, ſeruants) direction how to carry themſelues in euery thing they take in hand, yea in euery thing that appertaineth to them. For, Gods word is giuen to make vs perfect, thorowly 
                  2 Tim. 3. 17. 
                  furniſhed vnto all good workes.
               
               5. It is a good warrant to iuſtifie vs in all our actions: ſo as, going along with it, we need not care what any man can ſay againſt vs. If a man be ſure that he haue ſtatute law, or the kings proclamation on his ſide, he is bold.
               From this reaſon which is of ſuch weight, I gather two propoſitions to adde force to this motiue.
               1. That ſeruants obey their maſters, is no arbitrary matter, but a neceſſary duty: not left to his will whether he will doe it or no, but a thing whereunto he is bound: and that not only by ciuill conſtitutions of men, but alſo by a diuine inſtitution of God: ſo as it is not only a matter of ciuill policy, but alſo of conſcience, to be done for conſcience ſake.
               2. That no creature can diſpence with ſeruants, ſo as they ſhould be exempted from doing their duty to their maſter. If they could, they were greater then God, and their will aboue Gods will. Among creatures, maſters themſelues are to be reckoned: now becauſe it is Gods will that ſeruants ſhould be in ſubiection, their maſters cannot exempt them from it. Maſters may let them goe free: but retaining them as ſeruants, they cannot exempt them from a ſeruants ſubiection. Wherefore though maſters be careleſſe in exacting dutie, yet let ſeruants be conſcionable in yeelding duty, becauſe it is Gods will.
            
            
               §. 43. Of the fourth reaſon, the reward of good ſeruice.
               
               The fourth reaſon is plainly and largely expreſſed in theſe IIII. words, Knowing that whatſoeuer good thing any man doth, the 
                  
                     Sciat ſeruus Deum redditurum ſeruitutis mercedem. Conſtit. Apoſt. l. 4. c. 12. Col. 3. 24. 
                  ſame ſhall he receiue of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. The generall ſumme whereof is a Declaration of the reward of good ſeruice. To which purpoſe ſaith the Apoſtle to ſeruants in another place, Of the Lordye ſhall receiue a reward.
               
               This firſt is to be noted to adde force to the former reaſons.

For if any aske, what if maſters ſtand in Chriſts ſtead, what maketh that to the purpose? ſurely it maketh much to moue ſeruants: becauſe maſters ſtand in his roome who will reward that which is done for his ſake.
               If againe they aske, what benefit is it to be Chriſts ſeruant? it may be anſwered, very great: for Chriſt will reward all his ſeruants.
               If further it be asked, what is gotten by doing Gods will?
               
                  Anſw. Euen that which all aime at, reward for ſeruice.
               As this addeth weight to al the other reaſons, ſo is it in it ſelfe a weighty reaſon, as weighty as any can be to our corrupt nature. Hope of reward is it which maketh all ſorts of people to take the paines which they doe in their ſeuerall places. But hauing Treat. 1. §. 127. before handled this generall point of reward, I will here more diſtinctly ſhew what kinde of reward it is wherewith the Lord will recompence the good ſeruice of faithfull ſeruants.
               Gods reward is both of temporall and eternall bleſſings.
               The temporall bleſſings which heretofore God hath beſtowed What reward God giueth to good ſeruants. on faithfull ſeruants, and which on that ground other like ſeruants may expect, are theſe eſpecially.
               1. He will moue maſters to reſpect ſuch ſeruants, as he moued 
                     Eſt. 6. 3. 
                  Ahaſh-veroſh to recompence the fidelity of Mordecai.
               
               2. If maſters faile therein, he will moue ſtrangers to recompence them: as he moued 
                     Gen. 39. 21. the Iaylor to fauour Ioſeph when his maſter had caſt him in priſon: and 
                     & 41. 40. 
                  Pharaoh to aduance him to great dignity.
               3. To draw the hearts of their maſters and others the more vnto them, he will make the things which they take in hand to proſper. Thus did he bleſſe 
                     Gen 39. 2. 
                  Ioſeph, and 
                     & 24. 56. 
                  Abrahams ſeruant.
               4. In dealing for themſelues he will bleſſe their labours, as he bleſſed 
                     Gen. 30. 43. 
                  Iaakobs.
               
               5. He will, when they come to keepe ſeruants, prouide ſuch ſeruants for them, as they were to their maſters. 
                     Gen. 43. 23. In Egypt God bleſſed Ioſeph with a faithfull ſeruant. Dauid, who 1 Sam. 17. 34. ventured his life to ſaue his fathers ſheepe, had 2 Sam. 21. 17. & 23. 15. many ſeruants that ventured their liues for him.
               To this purpoſe may be applied that prouerbe which

Chriſt oft vſeth, 
                     Luk. 6. 38. 
                  with what meaſure yee mete ſhall it be meaſured to you againe.
               
               The eternall reward is expreſſed in this phraſe, 
                     Col. 3. 24. 
                  the reward of the inheritance, for that inheritance is meant which Chriſt mentioneth in this clauſe, 
                     Mat. 25. 34. 
                  Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world, and Saint Peter in this, 1 Pet. 1. 4. 
                  an inheritance incorruptible, and vndeſiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerued in heauen. What can be more ſaid? What ſhall not be vndergone for this reward? How willingly doe prentiſes paſſe ouer their prentiſhip in hope of a temporarie freedome of an earthly citie? 
                     Gen. 29. 20. Many yeares ſeruice were but as a few daies to Iaakob becauſe he liked his reward. But behold here a greater reward, which we muſt needs like much better. If this be not ſufficient to moue ſeruants to all dutie, I know not what can be ſufficient.
            
         
         
            
            
               The eighth Treatiſe. Duties of Maſters.
            
               §. 1. Of the heads of Maſters duties.
               
               
                  EPHES. 6. 9.
                  And yee Maſters doe the ſame things vnto them: forbearing threatning: Knowing that your Maſter alſo is in heauen: neither is there reſpect of perſons with him.
               
               
                  IN the laſt place the duties of maſters are declared by the Apoſtle, and that in this verſe, where he noteth,

                     1. The kindes of their duties.
                     2. A Reaſon to enforce the ſame.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        The kindes are ſet forth
                        Generally (doe the ſame things.)
                        
                     
                     
                        Particularly (forbearing threatning.)
                        
                     
                  
               
               The reaſon is taken from that ſubiection wherein maſters are to an higher maſter (knowing that your maſter alſo.) And it is amplified,

                     1. By the equall ſubiection of maſters and ſeruants to that maſter (your alſo.)
                     
                     2. By the place where that maſter is (in heauen.)
                     
                     3. By his property, in this phraſe (neither is there reſpect of perſons with him.)
                     
                  
               
               Becauſe the ſeuerall duties of maſters are here but pointed at, and infolded vnder generall termes, I will (as in former

treatiſes hath beene done) propound a diſtinct order, whereby we may the better finde out their duties, and handle them one after another.
               All may be drawne vnto theſe two heads.

                     1. Care in chooſing good ſeruants.
                     2. Conſcience in well vſing them.
                  
               
               For well vſing their ſeruants, maſters muſt haue an eie to their place, and authority: and in reſpect thereof,

                     1. Wiſely maintaine their authority.
                     2. Rightly manage the ſame.
                  
               
               The well managing of their authority is generally noted in this phraſe, doe the ſame things: but more particularly in 
                     Col. 4. 1.
another place referred to theſe two branches

                     
                        1. Iuſtice.
                     
                        2. Equity.
                  
               
               Of theſe in order.
            
            
               §. 2. Of maſters chooſing good ſeruants.
               
               The firſt thing that a man, who taketh vpon him to be a maſter, muſt take care of, is to entertaine good ſeruants into his ſeruice. 
                     Pſal. 101. 6. 
                  Mine eies (ſaith Dauid) ſhall be vpon the faithfull of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way he ſhall ſerue me. What doth this phraſe (mine eies ſhall be vpon the faithfull) imply, but that he will diligently and carefully inquire after ſuch: yea mine eies (ſaith he) not another mans eies: he would not put all the truſt vpon others: he would himſelfe make what proofe and triall he could. Such an emphaſis hath this phraſe (mine eies) where 
                     Iob 19. 27. 
                  Iob ſaith; whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelfe, and mine eies ſhall behold, and not another for me.
               
               1. Seruants are of all other things (except wife and children) Reaſons. of beſt and greateſt vſe. If then men be carefull in well chooſing other things, as houſes, land, houſhold-ſtuffe, horſes, and all manner of cattell (as men are very circumſpect therein) ſhould they not be much more carefull in well chooſing ſeruants?
               2. Thus will maſters ſhew that they ſeeke, and aime at the good of their family: yea and in their family at the good of Church and common-wealth: for good members of a family are likelieſt to proue profitable to Church & common-wealth.
               
                  
3. When good ſeruants are choſen, there is hope of receiuing the more good from them, and doing more good vnto them. They will be pliable to all good admonition, docible by all good inſtruction, ſeruiceable in all things they take in hand.
               
                  
                     Obiect. A maſter may make a bad ſeruant to become a good one.
                  
                     Anſw. There is a great hazard and venture therein, eſpecially if they be growne to ripe yeares: no creature is eaſily tamed, or brought from the naturall courſe it hath taken, after it is growne vp: a bough that hath growne crooked many yeares together will hardly be made ſtraight. It is not in mans power to make a bad ſeruant good: neither can man expect Gods bleſſing therein, when he obſerueth not a right courſe warranted by God.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. What courſe is fitteſt for choice of ſeruants? Direction for chooſing of ſeruants.
                  
                  1. If they be young, ſee how they haue beene from their infancy educated. Great is the benefit of good education: and much good may be expected from thence: for it is the means which God hath ſanctified for good.
                  But if they be growne to ripe yeares, chooſe ſuch as feare God, ſuch were they vpon whom 
                        Pſal. 101. 6. 
                     Dauid caſt his eies.
                  On this ground did 
                        Philem. verſ 10. Saint Paul aduiſe Philemon to take Oneſimus againe, becauſe grace was then wrought in his heart.
                  1. Gods feare is the ground of all good obedience and Why ſuch ſeruants as feare God are to be choſen. faithfulneſſe: note the examples of ſuch good and faithfull ſeruants as are commended in Scripture, and you ſhall finde them all to feare God.
                  2. Such will not only be diligent in their worke, but they will alſo faithfully call vpon God to proſper thoſe things which they take in hand in their maſters behalfe, inſtance the example of 
                        Gen. 24. 12. 
                     Abrahams ſeruant.
                  3. God will haue ſuch reſpect vnto thoſe ſeruants which feare his name, as for their ſakes to bleſſe their maſters houſe. Thus was 
                        Gen. 39. 5. 
                     Potiphars houſe bleſſed for Ioſephs ſake.
                  2. Make ſome triall of their fitneſſe to that calling, worke

and ſeruice whereunto thou ſhalt put them. From ſuch there may be hope of profit & benefit by their ſeruice. 
                        Gen. 29. 14. 
                     Laban made triall of Iaakob a moneth before he couenanted for any long continuance.
                  3. Take ſuch eſpecially as are of meane and poore eſtate, and know not how to maintaine themſelues but by ſeruice. Thus will a double worke of charitie be done therein: and thus maiſt thou looke for better ſeruice: for commonly ſuch are moſt induſtrious, and moſt obedient to their maſters.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. When men haue taken all the care they can in their choice, they may be deceiued.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. Then much more likely is it, that if they be careleſſe therein, they ſhall be deceiued.
                  2. Diligent, and wiſe ſearch, is a meanes to finde out the diſpoſition and abilitie of ſeruants.
                  3. If hauing vſed the meanes men be deceiued, they may haue the more comfort in bearing the croſſe, becauſe they haue not wittingly or careleſly pulled it vpon themſelues.
               
            
            
               §. 3. Of maſters careleſneſſe in chuſing ſeruants.
               
               Contrary is their careleſneſſe, who are ready to receiue any into their houſe, euen Atheiſts, Papiſts, ſwearers, ſwaggerers, profane wretches, vncleane perſons, and ſuch like, againſt whom Dauid proteſteth, he would not haue him that worketh deceit to dwell in 
                  
                     Pſal. 101. 7. 
                  his houſe; nor him that telleth lies to tarrie in his ſight. They who entertaine ſuch, make their houſes to be cages of vncleane birds, ſeminaries of wicked perſons, and vnprofitable members: for one ſcabbed ſheepe is enough to infect a whole flocke. No maruell though many miſchiefes fall vpon ſuch a familie: for a man were as good bring ſo many Snakes and Adders into his houſe, as ſuch perſons: yea with them is brought Gods curſe. Can any good then be looked for? Such fooliſh maſters regard neither themſelues, nor their houſhold: no nor yet Church or Common-wealth. If none would entertaine ſuch, it might be a meanes to make them alter their condition.
               Many are not only careleſſe in chuſing good ſeruants, but alſo except againſt ſuch as are religious; thinking it a matter of reproach to entertaine them. By which conceit they oft put away Gods bleſſing from their houſe.
               Others ſo ſtand vpon a great portion of money with a prentiſe,

or a clerke, or other ſeruant, as they will take none but rich mens children. Whence it commeth to paſſe, that this point (which is a great point) of charitie is neglected: perſons moſt vnfit for ſeruice are entertained, and ſuch many times as ſcorne to doe ſeruice. Thus their maſters grow weary of them: the ſeruants loſe their time: neuer proue to be their crafts-maſters: and their parents repent the giuing of ſuch a portion with them.
            
            
               §. 4. Of maſters maintaining their authoritie.
               
               After that maſters haue choſen good ſeruants, their dutie is well to vſe them: which by reaſon of the difference betwixt maſters and ſeruants cannot be well done, except maſters wiſely maintaine their authoritie. A maſter therefore muſt be able 1 Tim. 3. 4. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  well to rule his owne houſe: this is a dutie which the Apoſtle in particular requireth of a Biſhop, who is maſter of an houſe, but it appertaineth in generall to all maſters of families. Women alſo who by vertue of their places are miſtreſſes, are commanded 1 Tim. 5. 14. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  to guide the houſe, or to rule, and performe the part of a miſtreſſe therein. It was the 
                     Mat. 8. 9. Centurions commendation, that hauing ſeruants vnder him, he had them at his command.
               1. Gods image and authoritie, which a maſter carrieth, is thus preſerued.
               2. Thus ſhall a maſter haue much better ſeruice done. Not one ſeruant of a thouſand, that is not kept vnder authoritie, will doe good ſeruice. A like dutie to this was enioyned to an husband in relation to a wife, Treat. 4.
            
            
               §. 4. Some of the reaſons, directions, & other points there handled, may be here applied. Read it therefore.
               For this end three things are to be obſerued. Direction.
               
               1. That maſters carrie themſelues worthy of their place, and worthy of that honour which is due to them: which may beſt be done by making themſelues a patterne of ſuch good things as in their places appertaine to them. 
                     Joſ. 24. 15. 
                  I and my houſe will feare the Lord, ſaith Ioſuah: he would not only put them to it, but he alſo would doe it, he would goe before them. I will behaue my ſelfe wiſely, I will walke within my houſe with a perfect heart, ſaith 
                     Pſal. 101. 2. 
                  Dauid.
               
               2. That maſters keepe their ſeruants in awe and feare. 1 Tim. 3. 4. Children muſt be kept in ſubiection: much more ſeruants.
               
                  
3. That maſters doe the things which they doe in their cariage towards their ſeruants with authoritie: Command, forbid, rebuke (to vſe 
                     Tit. 2. 15. the Apoſtles phraſe) with all authoritie. The manner of ſpeech which the Centurion vſed to his ſeruants (
                     Mat. 8. 9. 
                  goe, come, doe this) ſauour of authoritie. So the Church taking vpon her the perſon of a miſtreſſe, vſeth a word of authoritie, 
                     Cant. 3. 5. 
                  I charge you not to doe this.
            
            
               §. 5. Of maſters making their authoritie to be deſpiſed.
               
               The aberrations in the defect contrary to the forenamed dutie How maſters loſe their honour. and point of wiſdome, are many: as
               1. When maſters carrie themſelues baſely and abiectly before 1. By baſenes. their ſeruants: being light in their behauiour, fooliſh in their cariage, giuen to drunkenneſſe, vncleanneſſe, lewd companie, and other vices. Nabal was ſuch an one: for his ſeruant could ſay of him, 1 Sam. 25. 17. 
                  He is a ſonne of Belial. Dauid, though he did not giue himſelfe ouer to ſuch foule ſinnes as theſe are, yet he oft failed in an vnſeemly cariage before his ſeruants, as when 1 Sam. 21. 13. 
                  he changed his behauiour, and fained himſelfe mad, and ſcrabled on doores, and let his ſpittle fall downe vpon his beard: and againe, 2 Sam. 19. 3, 5. when he gaue ſuch reines to his paſſion, for the death of his traiterous ſonne Abſolom, as his people being aſhamed ſtole away from him, and Ioab his ſeruant was forced roundly to tell him of it, ſaying, thou haſt ſhamed this day the faces of all thy ſeruants, &c.
               Miſtreſſes oft loſe their authoritie by conſpiring with their ſeruants to goe abroad, take away goods, goſſip, and doe ſuch other like things priuily without their husbands conſent: they make themſelues thereby ſlaues to their ſeruants, not daring to doe any thing which may offend their ſeruants, leſt they ſhould diſcouer to their maſters ſuch lewd pranks as their Miſtreſſes did.
               2. When maſters are too remiſſe and ſheepiſh: intreating and 2. By remiſnes. praying their ſeruants to doe ſuch things as they ought to command and require at their hands: and if it be not done, all their remedie is patience, or elſe to doe it themſelues. Howſoeuer this might be counted meekneſſe, and gentleneſſe towards equals and ſtrangers, ouer whom we haue no authoritie, yet towards ſeruants it is too baſe remiſneſſe: yea it is a relin quiſhing of that power which God hath giuen, and whereof God will take an account.
               3. When maſters ſuffer their ſeruants to be their companions, 3. By familiaritie.
                  
playing, drinking, reuelling with them, and ſaying (as it is in the prouerbe) haile fellowes met. Thus ſeruants oft take libertie to preſume aboue their maſter: for men are naturally prone to ambition; and, if an inch be giuen, they will take an ell. They who in this kinde ſo farre debaſe themſelues, as to giue their ſeruants power ouer their owne bodie, doe make both themſelues, and their true lawfull bedfellow to be deſpiſed: themſelues, in that ſuch ſeruants as are ſo made one fleſh, will thinke to keepe in awe ſuch a maſter or miſtreſſe, as they haue knowne, through feare of reuealing that ſinne: their bedfellow, in that ſuch ſeruants will thinke to be maintained, and boulſtered vp by the maſter or miſtreſſe, whom they haue ſo knowne. On this ground was 
                     Gen. 16. 3, 4. 
                  Sarah deſpiſed in the eyes of Hagar her maid.
               4. When maſters are ouer-ruled by their ſeruants to doe any 4. By letting goe the reines. vniuſt or vnlawfull thing: as 2 Chro. 14. 17. 
                  Ioaſh, who by his ſeruants was drawne to idolatrie: and 
                     Ier. 38. 5. 
                  Zedekiah, who gaue the Prophet Ieremiah into his ſeruants hands, vſing this baſe and abiect ſpeech, 
                     Ier. 38. 5. 
                  The King is not he that can doe any thing againſt you. Thus will ſeruants ſoone proue maſters: and if they once come to this high pitch to rule, rather then to be ruled, they will quickly proue intolerable. For 
                     Pro. 30. 22. this is one of the foure things noted by the Wiſeman, which the earth cannot beare, namely, a ſeruant when he reigneth: and 
                     Eccl. 10. 5, 7. this is one of thoſe euils which proceed from rulers, that ſeruants ride vpon horſes, that is, are aduanced aboue their place and degree: whence it followeth, that 
                     Eccl. 10. 5, 7. 
                  Gouernours walke as ſeruants vpon the earth, they are deiected below their place and degree. It falleth out in this caſe betwixt ſeruants and maſters, as betwixt ſcoales, or ballances; if the weights that vſe to lie in one ballance to keepe it downe be taken away, it will ſuddenly flie vp, and ſo the other ballance will be kept downe.
            
            
               §. 6. Of maſters too great rigour.
               
               The contrary in the exceſſe is too great rigour and aufterity manifeſted in looke, ſpeech, and actions.
               1. In looke, when a maſter cannot caſt a good eie on his ſeruant. 
                     Gen. 31. 2, 5. 
                  Iaakob was much diſcountenanced by the countenance of his maſter. Many maſters by their continuall frowning browes, and fiery eies, doe much terrifie their ſeruants.
               2. In ſpeech, when maſters cannot giue a good word to their

ſeruants, but if they be moued neuer ſo little, caſt vpon them all the reproachfull names that they can call to minde: little thinking of this fearfull doome, 
                     Mat. 5. 22. 
                  Whoſoeuer ſhall ſay, thou foole, ſhall be in danger of hell fire.
               
               Thus did Saul manifeſt a malitious and miſchieuous minde againſt Ionathan and Dauid by the foule language he gaue. Some haue ſuch a froward and peruerſe tongue, as they can neuer ſpeake directly to their ſeruants: but if they command or forbid a thing, they will doe it after ſuch a manner as their ſeruant can ſcarce tell what they meane: and this not only when their ſeruant hath offended them, but in their beſt mood. So ſhrewiſh are others, as their tongues ſeldome lie ſtill: but they are euer chiding vpon euery ſmall occaſion: whereby it commeth to paſſe that their ſeruants are no more moued with it, then the Doues, and Stares that continually abide in Belfraies, are moued with the ringing of bels. Such bitterneſſe alſo is mixed with the childings of many, as they belch out of their blacke mouthes, moſt direfull imprecations. What can be ſaid of ſuch tongues, but that they are 
                     Iam. 3. 6. 
                  ſet on fire of hell? As other aberrations wherein maſters are reproued, are to be applied to miſtreſſes, ſo this eſpecially. For miſtreſſes doe commonly moſt offend in ſhrewiſhneſſe of ſpeech.
               3. In actions, when maſters are too frequent, and too furious 
                     Quamuis dominus ſeruo praeſtet, tamen ſe aequalem iudicet quatenus homo exiſtit. Conſtit. Apoſt. l. 4. c. 12. ſtrikers: ſtriking their ſeruants on euery occaſion, not caring how they ſtrike. In theſe and other like euidences of too much auſteritie and plaine arrogancy maſters forget that they are men. Though for outward order a maſter be more excellent then a ſeruant, yet as a man he ought to iudge himſelfe equall. This extreme can be no good meanes to maintaine authoritie: but it is a plaine abuſe thereof. Maſters ought ſo 
                     Serui colant potius te quàm timeant. Senec. epiſt. 47. to carrie themſelues as their ſeruants may rather reuerence, then dread them.
            
            
               §. 7. Of maſters commanding power reſtrained to things lawfull. 
                  Extent of maſters power.
               
               That a maſter may the better know how to maintaine his authoritie, I will diſtinctly declare the extent of his power, and that in theſe foure particulars, 1. In Commanding. 2. In Correcting. 3. In ordering the mariage of their ſeruants. 4. In diſpoſing their perſon.
               
               
                  
Within the liſts of theſe two vertues Iuſtice and Equitie (whereunto all the duties which maſters owe their ſeruants ſhall §. 20, 21, &c.
                   afterward be referred) muſt the commanding power of maſters be bounded.

                     1. Iuſtice requireth two things,

                           1. A reſtraint of maſters commandements.
                           2. An execution thereof.
                        
                     
                  
               
               The reſtraint is vnto Gods law, that a maſter command nothing againſt it, but what is agreeable to it. Abiſhai would Nothing vnlawfull to be commanded by maſters. 1 Sam. 26. 9. faine haue had Dauids warrant to haue killed Saul: but Dauid was ſo farre from commanding him to doe it, as he kept him from it.
               Maſters are but ſubordinate miniſters vnder God: they muſt therefore command nothing againſt his law. As a Iudge, high-Sheriffe, and all other officers vnder the King, muſt make the Kings law the ground of all thoſe things which they require of the Kings ſubiects: ſo maſters muſt make Gods law the ground of all thoſe things which they require of their ſeruants, who are alſo the ſeruants of Chriſt. Beſides, to what purpoſe is it to command that which a ſeruant may and muſt refuſe to doe? But in no Treat. 7. §. 38 vnlawfull thing may he obey.
            
            
               §. 8. Of maſters preſuming aboue their authoritie.
               
               Contrary is the arrogancie and preſumption of many maſters, who make their owne will the rule of their ſeruants obedience. This muſt needs be a leaden rule, which may be bowed this way, that way, and euery way, becauſe of the flexible and variable humour of man. Hence is it that many moſt vile and horrible things are commanded, becauſe they are agreeable to the commanders humour. Abſolom bid his ſeruants commit a moſt deteſtable murder vpon his owne brother, and note how he preſſeth it, Haue not I commanded you? 
                  2 Sam. 13. 28.
               
               More preſumptuous is he that taketh vpon him to be the The Popes preſumption. great commander of all Chriſtians, the Pope of Rome, and other maſters and gouernours of Ieſuites, Friers, Monkes, and other like orders, who command ſuch as are vnder their authoritie to commit treaſons, raiſe rebellions, kill Kings, and doe other like execrable villanies.
               And to iuſtifie the Pope from whom all inferiour gouernours

receiue their power, and by whoſe will they muſt be ruled, theſe blaſphemous poſitions doe Papiſts hold of his power, He can doe all things of right as God. He is as God hauing 
                  
                     Extrauag. de maior. & obed. Alban. in lib. de poteſtat. Pap. & Eccleſ. Gratian. in Decret. diſt. 40. 
                  on earth fulneſſe of power. If he ſhall draw with him innumerable ſoules of men into hell, yet none may ſay to him, what doeſt thou? Doth not the Apoſtles 2 Theſſ. 2. 4. In Eccleſia cath. ſemper creditum eſt Rom. Pontificem poſſe ſua authoritate leges ferre, quae in conſcientia obligent. Bellar. de Rom. Pontif. l. 4. c. 15. deſcription of that man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition, agree to him of whom thoſe things are ſpoken? Is he not in Papiſts account, as God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God? Which is further confirmed by that power which they giue him of making lawes to binde the conſcience, and coining new articles of faith.
               Not only popiſh, but profane maſters alſo too much exceed in this preſumptuous vſe of their power aboue their power: as they who enioyne their ſeruants to kill, to ſteale, to ſweare, to forſweare, to lie, to giue falſe meaſures, and weights, to goe to maſſe, to profane the Sabbath, with other like ſinnes. In all theſe, and all other things like to theſe, being againſt Gods law, maſters haue no power to command: they goe aboue their commiſſion: and ſhall accordingly anſwer for it.
            
            
               §. 9. Of maſters commanding ſeruants to doe their dutie.
               
               2. The execution of a maſters commanding power conſiſteth in thoſe things which God hath enioyned as bounden duties. Theſe a maſter by vertue of his authoritie muſt command his ſeruants to doe: as to worſhip God, to ſanctifie his Sabbath, to be diligent and conſcionable in his calling, with other like duties, which God compriſeth vnder theſe words, the way of the Lord, righteouſneſſe and iudgement: and ſaith that he knew that Abram would command his houſhold to doe them. 
                  
                     Gen. 18. 19.
               
               The charge giuen to maſters in the fourth commandement concerning ſeruants, (thou nor thy man-ſeruant, nor thy maidſeruant) 
                  
                     Exo. 20. 10. proueth as much. Ioſiah is commended for cauſing his 
                  2 Chr. 34. 32. 
                  people to ſtand to the couenant of God. On this ground if a maſter haue ſeruants that are papiſts, ſeparatiſts, or profane perſons, he ought to command them, and cauſe them to goe to the holy ordinances of God.
               It is one of the principall ends why God hath giuen power and authoritie to ſome ouer others, that by their authoritie they may cauſe them which are vnder them to obſerue the

commandements of God: euen as inferiour officers haue authoritie giuen them, to ſee the Kings lawes kept.
            
            
               §. 10. Of the ſinne of maſters in ſuffering ſeruants to neglect their dutie.
               
               It is contrary to that commanding power which God hath giuen to maſters, to ſuffer their ſeruants to omit, and neglect thoſe bounden duties which God hath commanded them: as if a ſeruant be ſo popiſh or profane as to refuſe to goe to the word, or Sacrament, or to performe any dutie whereunto he is bound, to let him alone. Though they themſelues doe thoſe duties, and though they doe not hinder and keepe their ſeruants from doing them, yet if they cauſe not their ſeruants alſo to doe them, they make themſelues acceſſarie to their ſeruants ſinne.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Euery mans conſcience is free, and cannot be forced; therefore maſters may not compell ſeruants to ſuch things as are againſt their conſcience.
                  
                     Anſw. Though the conſcience be free to a man, and out of anothers power, yet their outward actions are not free: and though faith, pietie, righteouſneſſe, nor any grace can be forced into men, yet they may be forced to vſe the meanes which God hath ſanctified for the breeding and increaſing of them. Though they cannot be forced to haue a religious and righteous heart, yet they may be forced to doe religious and righteous duties: or if a maſter cannot force theſe, yet he may and ought to doe his vttermoſt endeuour: by which means though he cannot free his ſeruant from death, yet he ſhall free his owne ſoule from the guilt of his death.
               
            
            
               §. 11. Of a maſters wiſdome in ordering things indifferent.
               
               Equitie hath reſpect to thoſe things which are in a maſters power to command or not command: ſuch are all ciuill actions as concerne himſelfe, concerning the particulars whereof God hath giuen no direct charge for an abſolute performance of them: as to goe of ſuch an errand, to doe ſuch a meſſage, to diſpatch ſuch a buſineſſe. Concerning theſe things I may ſay of a maſters power, as the Apoſtle doth of a parents power in 1 Cor. 7. 36, 37. another caſe; If he ſeeth it meet to be done, and commandeth his ſeruant to doe it, he doth well, he ſinneth not. If he ſeeth it

not meet to be done, and commandeth it not, he doth alſo well, he ſinneth not. Of this kinde of things ſpeaketh the Centurian, 
                     Matt. 8. 9. where he ſaith, I ſay to one, goe, to another, come, to a third, doe this.
               
               The marke which maſters muſt aime at in commanding or forbidding theſe, muſt be expediency: for all things that are 
                  1 Cor. 10. 23. 
                  lawfull, are not expedient. Expediency dependeth much vpon circumſtances, and conſequences which may follow vpon the doing of any thing: in obſeruing whereof the wiſdome of him who hath power to haue a thing done, or not done, eſpecially appeareth. When Dauid ſuffered not Huſhai his good friend, 2 Sam. 15. 33, 34. and wiſe counſeller, to goe with him when he fled from Abſolom, but bid him returne to the citie and there abide, he had an eie to the good conſequence that might follow thereupon. And when Ioab commanded Cuſhi rather then Ahimaaz to 2 Sam. 18. 20, 21. carrie the newes of Abſoloms death, he had an eie to the meetneſſe of the perſons, and to the kinde of meſſage.
               To apply this to our purpoſe, Equity requireth that maſters (in commanding things indifferent, which they haue power to command or not to command) haue an eie to their ſeruants ability, ſex, age, diſpoſition, conſcience, and other like circumſtances, that the thing which they command be ſomewhat agreeable to them, not aboue their ability, not vnbeſeeming their ſex, not vnfitting their age, not thwarting their diſpoſition, not againſt their conſcience.
            
            
               §. 12. Of maſters offence againſt expediency.
               
               It is contrary to equity for a maſter to regard only himſelfe, and his own mind, euen in things that are lawfull. Paul was not 1 Cor. 10. 33. of this minde, when he ſaid, He ſought not his owne profit: no nor his owne will. Expediency and inexpediency were great motiues vnto him, to forbeare things which were otherwiſe lawfull: yet little is this regarded by many: for
               1. Many command things to the very vttermoſt of their ſeruants ſtrength, if not aboue it, (as Pharaoh) or elſe things dangerous, 
                     Exod. 5. 7. which may bring much miſchiefe vpon them. Dauid 
                  2 Sam. 23. 17. was touched in heart for mouing only by a wiſh his ſeruants to fetch him water with the danger of their liues.
               
                  
2. Others againſt comelineſſe put men to doe maids workes, and maids to doe mens worke.
               3. Others vpon meere partiality keepe vnder old and good ſeruants, and preferre much younger before them.
               4. Others will forcibly make ſeruants doe things againſt their naturall diſpoſition, as to handle, yea and eat ſuch things as they cannot endure to touch or ſee.
               5. Others in doubtfull matters will vrge and preſſe them againſt their conſcience.
               Howſoeuer in theſe and other ſuch like things not vnlawfull, ſeruants ought to doe what they can to ſatisfie their maſters command, if he be peremptory in vrging them: yet ought not a maſter to be too peremptory in preſſing his authoritie and power.
            
            
               §. 13. Of the power of maſters to correct their ſeruants.
               
               The ſecond point wherein a maſters power conſiſteth is correction: which may be giuen by lookes, words, or deeds.
               By a mans looke his anger and wrath againſt another is manifeſted. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   In Hebrew the ſame word ſignifieth a face, and wrath: becauſe wrath ſooneſt ſheweth it ſelfe in a mans face. It is noted of Cain, that being very wrath his countenance fell 
                  
                     Si quis in domo per inobedientiam domeſticae paci aduerſatur, corripiatur ſeu verbo, ſeu verbere, ſea quo. libet alio genere poenae iuſto at

                  downe, Gen. 4. 5. Now the manifeſtation of a maſters wrath againſt his ſeruant is a correction.
               But words whether of rebuke, or threatning, doe much more declare the ſame. This phraſe which Solomon vſeth Pro. 29. 19. (a ſeruant will not be corrected with words) ſheweth that there is a correction by words: and though it be negatiuely propounded, yet doth it not imply that correction by words is not to be vſed to a ſeruant, but rather, if thereby he be not moued, that blowes muſt be added thereto: which is a correction by deeds, whereof Chriſt maketh mention in the parable of thoſe ſeruants that according to the greatneſſe of their fault are 
                     Luke 12. 47. to be beaten with many ſtripes. It is therefore in a maſters power to correct his ſeruant with ſtripes, or blowes. Which being ſo, I will ſhew,

                     1. How farre his power herein extendeth.
                     2. How it is to be ordered.
                  
               
            
            
               
               §. 14. Of the reſtraint of maſters power: that it reacheth not to their ſeruants life.
               
               Concerning the extent of a maſters power in correcting his ſeruant, this queſtion is to be reſolued, Whether a maſter haue power for any fault to take away his ſeruants life.
               
               
                  Anſw. His power reacheth not ſo farre, as is euident by theſe reaſons.
               1. There is no precept, nor approued example, nor any other warrant out of Gods word for it. The Iewes had great power ouer ſuch ſeruants as were ſtrangers: Of them they might 
                  
                     Leu. 25. 44, 45, 46. 
                  buy bond-men and bond-maids: they might haue them for a poſſeſſion: and take them for an inheritance for their children after them, to be bond-men for euer: they might be put to the moſt toyling, droyling, baſe, and abiect workes that they had, as drawing water, hewing wood, and the like; but yet their maſters 
                     Ioſ. 9. 27. had not power ouer their liues.
               2. A maſter might not diſmember his ſeruant: if vnawares he did ſmite out an eie or tooth of his ſeruant, he muſt make a recompence: which was to let him goe free. Much leſſe therefore 
                     Exod. 21. 26. might he take away his ſeruants life.
               3. If a ſeruant died vnder his maſters hand when he corrected him, though he intended not wilfully to murder him, that maſter was to be puniſhed. It was not therfore lawfull for 
                     Exod. 21. 20. a maſter wittingly to kill a ſeruant.
               4. The power of life is proper to the publike magiſtrate, who doth all things in open publike places, that ſo there may be many witneſſes of his iuſt proceeding. If maſters had this power, many might priuily be put to death, and no man know for what cauſe, as it is in popiſh inquiſitions.
               5. 
                     Si Dominus ſeruum ceciderit, vel lethale vulnus inflixerit, reus homicidij ſit. Iuſtin. Cod. l. 9. tit. 18. The approued lawes of men make it wilfull murder for a maſter to ſlay his ſeruant wittingly, though the ſeruants fault be neuer ſo hainous. Neither the authority of the maſter, nor deſert of the ſeruant, ſhall exempt the maſter that ſlayeth his ſeruant from the guilt and puniſhment of felony.
               
                  
                     Obiect. In ancient times maſters had this power.
                  
                     Anſw. They neuer of right had it, though ſome might exerciſe it. Among Gods people it was neuer exerciſed in any age of the world. That liberty which was taken, was among

the heathen: and yet among them as polities came to be more 
                        Apud Gentes animaduertere poſſumus Dominis in ſeruos vitae, neciſ
                              
                                 
                              
                              que

Teſtim. l. 3. c. 73. and more ciuilly gouerned, that vſurped liberty by the lawes of Magiſtrates was much reſtrained: and when Emperors and Kings became Chriſtians, it was vtterly taken away.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. If a man take an enemie by warre, he hath power to kill him.
                  
                     Anſw. If in the time of the warre he ſlay him not, but then ſpare him, and take him as a captiue, and make him his ſeruant, though but a bondſlaue, he hath not power of his life.
               
            
            
               §. 15. Of maſters exceſſe in correcting ſeruants.
               
               Contrary to their iuſt and due power doe they, who in their rage ſtab their ſeruants, or otherwiſe make them away: yea they alſo who ſo vnmercifully and vnmeaſurably beat them with rod, cudgell, or any other thing, as death follow thereupon: for many there be who hauing once begunne to ſtrike, know not when to ceaſe, but lay on as if they were ſtriking ſtocks and blocks, and not their owne fleſh. God foreſaw that maſters were prone to ſuch cruelty, and therefore 
                     Deut. 25. 3. ſet a ſtint number of ſtripes, which none that beat another might exceed.
               Among theſe may be reckoned ſuch deſperate maſters as in their moode will ſtrike their ſeruant with any thing that commeth next to hand, be it heauy, cragged, hard, or ſharpe, they care not (
                     Pro. 26. 18. 
                  As a mad man who caſteth fire-brands, arrowes, and death.) Theſe things may endanger a ſeruants life, if not, they may breake his head, or otherwiſe wound, bruiſe, and lame him.
               It is beyond a maſters power by any correction to impaire life, health, or ſtrength of his ſeruant, or any way in his body to diſable him from doing that which otherwiſe he might haue beene able to doe.
               If maſters, no not for puniſhment of any ſinne, may not take away or endanger the life of his ſeruant, what may we thinke of ſuch maſters, as without any fault of their ſeruants, cauſe them to be made away by putting them vpon ſome deſperate attempt, either to maintaine their owne quarrell, or for ſome other vniuſt end? 2 Sam. 11. 15. 
                  Dauid dealt thus with Uriah: but afterwards he 
                     Pſal. 51. 14. ſorely repented this part of iniuſtice. At another

                  2 Sam. 23. 15, &c.
                   time when three of his ſeruants had fetched him water, which he longed for, with ieopardy of their liues, though in ſafety they returned, yet his heart ſmote him for his longing, and he would not drinke of that water becauſe they had ventured their liues to fetch it.
               But what may we ſay of ſuch maſters, as cauſe their ſeruants for their ſakes to commit felony, murther, treaſon, rebellion, and ſuch other things, as cauſe the publike magiſtrate to vnſheath his ſword againſt them, & cut them off? We noted this §. 8. before to be a grienous fault in regard of the vnlawfulneſſe of the thing: here further we may note it to be much more hainous in regard of the miſchiefe that followeth thereupon, which is the loſſe of their ſeruants life: ſo as thus they make themſelues acceſſary to a deteſtable ſinne, and guilty of the bloud of their ſeruant.
            
            
               §. 16. Of maſters ordering that correction they giue to their ſeruants.
               
               2. That maſters may well order that correction which they giue to their ſeruants, difference muſt be put betwixt the age, ſex, diſpoſition, and faults of thoſe whom they correct.
               1. Maſters ought not to be ſo forward to ſtrike ſuch as are growne in yeares, as the younger ſort. Yeares bring vnderſtanding, and a rebuke will make one of vnderſtanding more ſory for a fault, and more carefull to amend it, The direction preſcribed to parents (Treat. 6. §. 47.) for well ordering that correction which they giue to their children, may in many points be here fitly applied. Read it. then blowes: ſmart more workes vpon the younger ſort. But if notwithſtanding their yeares they be ſtout, and will not regard words, their ſtoutneſſe. muſt be beaten downe with blowes. 
                     Pro. 19. 25, 29. 
                  Smite a ſcorner, ſaith the wiſe man: and againe, Iudgements are prepared for ſcorners, and ſtripes for the backe of fooles.
               
               Seeing ſeruants in yeares are in this caſe to be corrected, it is further requiſite to put a difference betwixt the kinde or meaſure of correction which is giuen to them, and to the younger ſort: if they be corrected as children, they may either

make a toy of it, or the more diſdaine at it. 
                     Pro. 20. 30. Heris in famulos ſaeuitia adhibenda eſt, ſi aliter teneri non poſſunt. Cic. Offic. l. 2. 
                  Blewneſſe, wound, and ſtripes piercing into the inward parts of the belly, are a purging medicine againſt euill, to ſtout ſeruants of ripe yeares.
               2. If there be a maſter and miſtreſſe ioynt gouernours ouer an houſe, it is fitteſt for the maſter to correct men-ſeruants, the miſtreſſe maids. 
                     Seruam verberare viro maximae ignominiae eſt. Chryſ. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. 
                  Abraham put his maid ouer to Sarah in ſuch a caſe. Yet if a maid ſhould wax ſtout, and manniſh, and turne againſt her miſtreſſe, ſhe being weake, ſickly, with child, or otherwiſe vnable to maſter her maid, the maſter may and muſt beat downe her ſtoutneſſe and rebellion: 
                     Exo. 21. 20. ſo much did the law of God permit.
               3. If ſeruants be of an ingenious diſpoſition, willing and forward to doe that which belongeth vnto them, ſorry when they haue committed a fault, and carefull to amend their faults, many things may be paſſed ouer in them, which muſt be corrected in others. To this may be applied the counſell of the wiſeman, Take no heed to all the words that are 
                  
                     Eccl. 7. 21. 
                  ſpoken.
               
               4. Correction muſt be meaſured according to the greatneſſe 
                     —Adſit Regula peccat is quae poenas irroget aequas: Nec ſcutica dignum horribili ſectere flagello. Horat. l. 1. Sat. 3. of the fault puniſhed, and the circumſtances whereby the fault may iuſtly be aggrauated. The ſeruant that knew his maſters will and did it not ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes: But he that knew not and did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes, Luk. 12. 47, 48.
               Many aberrations are daily committed contrary to euery branch of this direction, in that maſters and miſtreſſes in exerciſing this part of their power are carried away with paſſion, and doe that which they doe in this kinde after their owne pleaſure. Thus they turne a dutie into ſinne, and by vndue correcting of their ſeruants prouoke God to correct them in his wrath, either here or in the world to come.
            
            
               §. 17. Of maſters power ouer their ſeruants in and about their mariage.
               
               The third point to be noted concerning a maſters power ouer his ſeruant, is about his ſeruants mariage. Sundry queſtions

are moued about this point, which I will briefly reſolue.
               
                  1. Queſt. Haue maſters power to order and diſpoſe their ſeruants mariage as they pleaſe?
                  
                     Anſw. No, not without the free conſent of the ſeruants themſelues: for mariages muſt be made with the free conſent of the parties that are maried.
               
               
                  
                     Obiect. The law implieth that a maſter hath power to giue 
                        Exo. 21. 4. his ſeruant a wife, for it ſheweth whoſe thoſe children ſhall be that are borne to that ſeruant, to whom a maſter hath giuen a wife.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. That law is to be vnderſtood of ſuch ſeruants as being ſtrangers were bond-ſlaues, ouer whom maſters had a more abſolute power then ouer others.
                  2. The maſters power of giuing did not ſimply force the ſeruant to marie the party ſo giuen: but reſtrained the ſeruant from marying any other then whom the maſter ſhould giue.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. Is not a maſters power in the matter of mariage as great ouer a ſeruant, as a parents ouer a childe?
                  
                     Anſw. No. See the reaſon Treat. 5. §. 20.
               
               
                  3. Queſt. May a maſter denie his ſeruant liberty to marie?
                  
                     Anſw. Yea, for the time that the ſeruant hath couenanted to be a ſeruant with his maſter. For that time a ſeruant is part of his maſters goods, and poſſeſſions. As bond ſeruants were a maſters poſſeſſion for euer: ſo couenanted ſeruants are his poſſeſſion for the time of their couenant. When God gaue the deuill leaue to ſeize on all that Iob had, by vertue of that 
                        Iob 1. 15, 16. permiſſion he ſeized on all kindes of Iobs ſeruants bond and free, as well as on his goods: which he could not haue done, if Iobs ſeruants had not beene as his goods.
                  Yet notwithſtanding if ſeruants ſhall make it knowne to their maſter, that neceſſity requireth they ſhould marie, ſuch reſpect ought to be had to the chaſtity euen of ſeruants, as in this caſe I may vſe the phraſe with the Apoſtle vſeth in reference to children, Let them be maried. 
                     1 Cor. 7. 36.
                  
               
               
                  4. Queſt. What if ſeruants marie without conſent of maſters, is that mariage nullified thereby?
                  
                     Anſw. No. The mariage being otherwiſe rightly performed, Quod fieri non debet factum valet. remaineth a firme mariage: though the ſeruants in

ſo doing haue ſinned: for which their maſter may iuſtly puniſh them.
               
               
                  5. Queſt. May a maſter keepe his ſeruants ſo maried without his conſent from their bed-fellowes?
                  
                     Anſw. He may exact the whole time of his couenant for ſeruice: but that power which by the bond of mariage huſbands and wiues haue ouer one anothers bodies, ſuffereth 1 Cor. 7. 3, 4. them not to be altogether ſeparated one from another. Beſides, our law freeth a maid-ſeruant when ſhe is maried, from her maſters couenant.
               
            
            
               §. 18. Of maſters rigour in forcing mariages on ſeruants: or in ſeparating man and wife.
               
               Contrary to a maſters power doe they, who force their ſeruants to marie whom they like not: as when a maſter hath defloured his maid, to couer his ſhame he will make one of his ſeruants marie her.
               They alſo doe contrary to their power who ſeeke to ſeparat their ſeruants that are maried from their bed-fellow: ſome will keepe the man at his houſe day and night from his wife, and ſo the wife from her husband: others will ſend one of them into remote parts of the land, where the other ſhall not know: yea others will be ſure to keepe them one from another, for they will ſend one of them beyond ſea for many yeares together, if not for euer. Theſe practiſes are againſt the law of mariage, and too rigorous and vniuſt.
            
            
               §. 19. Of maſters power to diſpoſe their ſeruants perſons.
               
               The fourth point to be noted of a maſters power ouer his ſeruants reſpecteth their perſons, which ſo properly belong to a maſter for the time of their ſeruice, as he may not only keepe them himſelfe for his owne ſeruice, but alſo paſſe them ouer, and giue, or ſell them to another. By Gods law not only 
                     Leu. 25. 39, 44. ſtrangers, but Iewes alſo might be ſold for ſeruants.
               The cuſtomes and ſtatutes of our land doe alſo permit maſters Maſters care in putting off ſeruants. to make ouer their ſeruants from one to one: and on their death-beds to bequeath them to whom they will, euen as their goods and poſſeſſions.
               That this power be not abuſed, in the executing thereof,

maſters muſt principally reſpect the good of their ſeruants: and for that end put them ouer to fit maſters, ſuch maſters as may doe them good and not euill, all the time of their abode with them, and ſeruice vnder them.
               Contrary hereunto doe they, who aime meerely at their owne aduantage, not caring to whom they put ouer their ſeruants, ſo they may make gaine thereby. Some will ſell them, namely, when they haue them beyond ſea, to Turks and Infidels; ſome to Papiſts, and other Idolaters; ſome to profane perſons; ſome to cruell inhumane beaſts; ſome to men of vnlawfull trades; ſome to men of no trades. Such maſters as make their ſeruants ouer to ſuch as theſe are, or like to theſe, ſhall anſwer for all the wrong is done to them.
            
            
               §. 20. Of maſters well managing their authoritie.
               
               This Apoſtle in 
                     Coloſſ. 4. 1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . another place giueth this charge to maſters, Giue vnto your ſeruants that which is iuſt and equall.
               
               By doing theſe two things maſters ſhall well manage their authoritie.
               
                  Iuſtice reſpecteth the place, and ſeruice of ſeruants. Difference betwixt iuſt and equall dealing.
               
               
                  Equitie reſpecteth their minde, and manner of doing ſeruice.
               All ſeruants, in that they are ſeruants, and doe their maſters worke, muſt haue that which of right belongeth to ſeruants. This is Iuſtice.
               
               Such ſeruants as beare an eſpeciall loue and liking to their maſters, doing ſeruice not by conſtraint, or with eye-ſeruice, as men-pleaſers, but in ſingleneſſe of heart with good will, and all good faithfulneſſe, ſeeking to the vttermoſt of their power, their maſters good, muſt be accordingly reſpected and dealt withall. This is Equitie. As the Apoſtle compriſeth Iuſtice vnder this phraſe (doe the ſame things) for ſeruice giue due recompence: ſo more eſpecially he compriſeth Equitie vnder it: for ſeruants good will and more then vſuall reſpect of their maſters, let maſters returne good will, and more then ordinarie reſpect to ſeruants. S. Peter noteth theſe two vertues vnder two other words, good, 
                  1 Pet. 2. 18. 
                  gentle: A maſters goodneſſe hath relation to Iuſtice: his gentleneſſe to Equitie.
               
            
            
               
               §. 21. Of maſters endeuouring the ſaluation of their ſeruants.
               
               That Iuſtice which is required of maſters reſpecteth the ſoule, bodie, and eſtate of their ſeruants.
               In reſpect of their ſoules good, maſters muſt ſeeke the ſpirituall I. Iuſti patres ſecundum haec temporalia bona, filiorum ſortem à ſeruorum conditione diſtinguebant: ad Deum autem colendum, in quo aeterna bona ſperanda ſunt, omnibus domus ſuae membris pari dilectione conſulebant. Aug. de Ciu. Dei l. 19. c. 15. edification of their ſeruants. When Zacheus firſt beleeued, Chriſt ſaid, Saluation is come to this houſe (Luk. 19. 9.) why to this houſe, rather then to this perſon, but becauſe he knew that Zacheus would doe the dutie of a good maſter, and ſeeke the ſaluation of his houſhold? Herein muſt maſters beare an impartiall reſpect to all in their houſe: as the holy Fathers, who though about temporall goods they put difference betwixt the place of children, and condition of ſeruants; yet in ſeruing God, wherein eternall happineſſe is looked for, they did with an equall reſpect prouide for all the members of their houſe. The proofes alleadged for ſeruants obedience to maſters care in this point, doe ſhew that this dutie appertaineth to maſters. See Treat. 7. §. 15.
               The reſpect which maſters owe to God, themſelues, their ſeruants, the Church, and Common-wealth where they liue, requireth as much.
               1. God hath commanded as much (Deut. 6. 7.) as this charge implieth, Thou ſhalt talke of my Lawes when thou ſittest in thine houſe: and God hath manifeſted his approbation thereof, by commending Abraham for commanding his children and houſehold to keepe the way of the Lord, Gen. 18. 19.
               2. Maſters themſelues reape great benefit by a faithfull diſcharge 
                     De ſalute eorum qui in domo tua ſunt ſollicitus, ac peruigil exiſtas, quia pro omnibus tibi ſubiectis rationē Domino reddes. Aug. de ſalut. docum. cap. 29. of this dutie: and that both by diſcharging a good conſcience to God, (who requireth this at their hands, in that he hath made them prophets and prieſts in their houſe, as well as kings; and will require an account of them for all that are vnder their gouernment:) and alſo by bringing their ſeruants to doe more faithfull ſeruice to them. For there is no ſuch meanes to ſtirre vp ſeruants to doe all good dutie, as the feare of God planted in their hearts. That ſeruant that ſhall finde true grace either firſt wrought, or further increaſed in him by his maſtersmeanes, will thinke him ſelfe ſo beholding to ſuch a maſter, as he ſhall neuer be able to make any ſufficient recompence, & therefore will endeuour to do what good ſeruice he can in way of thankfulnes: he will not only be faithfull & diligent in his buſineſſe, but he will call vpon God

to proſper his ſeruice for his maſters good, and to recompence that kindneſſe which his maſter hath done to him.
               3. No earthly thing that a maſter can doe for his ſeruant (be it portion of money, preferment to any place of profit or credit, or skill in a good trade and calling) can be comparable to the edifying of a ſeruant in grace.
               4. Seruants well inſtructed in pietie are likelieſt to proue moſt profitable not only to the familie, but alſo to the Church and Common-wealth where they liue.
               That maſters may the better edifie their ſeruants,
               1. They muſt daily inſtruct them in the principles of religion, Directions for edifying ſeruants. and all duties of pietie: admirable is the profit which will ariſe from a daily and conſtant vſe of religious exerciſes: though but a little time be ſpent at once, yet will much knowledge be gained by a frequent vſe of them. This dutie is ſo much the more neceſſarie, becauſe publike Miniſters cannot take ſuch particular notice of euery ſeruant in their Pariſhes, as maſters may in their families.
               2. Maſters muſt cauſe their ſeruants to goe to the publike miniſterie of the word, and worſhip of God, to be further built vp thereby, and confirmed in their faith. Maſters vnder the Law were 
                     Exo. 12. 44. commanded to let their ſeruants eat of the Paſſeouer, which was a ſolemne ſacrament. The Law which enioyneth all males to appeare 
                     Deut. 16. 16. on the ſolemne feaſt dayes before the Lord, implieth that ſeruants alſo ſhould goe. This dutie muſt eſpecially be performed on the Lords day: for the charge giuen to maſters in the fourth commandement for ſanctifying that day, is extended to ſeruants in theſe words, Thou, nor thy man-ſeruant, nor thy maid-ſeruant.
               
               3. Maſters, beſide inſtructing ſeruants at home, and cauſing them to goe to Church, muſt take an account of their profiting, both by the publike, and alſo by the priuate meanes of edification. Otherwiſe they ſhall not know how to order their manner of inſtructing them: when to giue them milke, & when ſtrong meat.
               4. To make the meanes more effectuall and profitable, they muſt to inſtruction adde prayer. Meanes, without Gods bleſſing vpon the meanes, are nothing. As they obſerue any grace wrought in their ſeruants, they muſt be thankfull vnto God for the ſame, and pray for the increaſe of it.
            
            
               
               §. 22. Of maſters neglecting to edifie their ſeruants.
               
               Contrary is the minde and practiſe of moſt maſters: they thinke if they allow their ſeruants ſufficient diet, lodging, and clothing, or wages according to their couenant, they haue done all that they need to doe: and anſwerably they doe no more: wherein they ſhew themſelues no better then the heathen. For doe not the heathen ſo?
               
                  
                     Obiect. At firſt taking of a ſeruant no more was couenanted.
                  
                     Anſw. There are two couenants whereunto a maſter ſtandeth bound: one with God; the other with his ſeruant. Though his couenant with his ſeruant requireth no more then ſome temporall commodities, yet Gods couenant requireth ſpirituall edification. Many maſters are ſo greedie of their ſeruants worke, as they are loth to afford any time, at morning or euening, for religious exerciſes: they thinke by their ſeruants labour to thriue, and thinke not of Gods bleſſing which maketh rich. Some goe ſo far therein, as they keepe their ſeruants from the publike worſhip of God, euen on the Lords day. Thus it commeth to paſſe, that ſeruants, who came ignorant and profane to a maſter, after long abode with him, ſo goe away as they came. Many that themſelues make ſome conſcience of fearing God, much faile herein: they regard not to teach their ſeruants the feare of God, whereby they depriue themſelues of much bleſſing, and pull Gods curſe vpon their perſons and houſes.
               
            
            
               §. 23. Of allowing ſeruants ſufficient food.
               
               In regard that ſeruants haue not bodies of braſſe, or ſteele, II. but of fleſh and bloud as all others, maſters that haue the benefit of their ſtrength and abilitie of their bodies, muſt be carefull of nouriſhing, and cheriſhing them: and that both in health, and ſickneſſe.
               
               For preſeruing ſeruants health, reſpect muſt be had to their Food, Clothing, Labour, Reſt.
               
               A due prouiſion of food for ſeruants is commended in Solomons 
                  Sufficient food to be allowed to ſeruants. Pro. 31. 15. & 27. 27. good houſe-wife, who giueth meat to her houſhold. And in the direction which he giueth to houſholders, in theſe words, Let the milke of thy goats be ſufficient for thy food, and for the food of thy family.
               
               The food which maſters prouide for their ſeruants muſt be

for qualitie, good and wholeſome; for quantitie, ſufficient to preſerue health and increaſe ſtrength; for time, giuen in due ſeaſon. It is noted that the hired ſeruants of the father of the 
                     Luk. 15. 17. prodigall childe had bread (by bread according to the Scripture phraſe is meant all kinde of needfull wholſome food: in which ſenſe it muſt needs be there taken, becauſe it is oppoſed to huskes, which are not very wholſome, fitter for ſwine then men) yea they had bread enough. It is further noted of that good ſteward who was, as a maſter, ruler ouer the houſhold, that 
                     Luk. 12. 42. he gaue the houſhold their portion of meat in due ſeaſon.
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. May not ſeruants be ſtinted of their food?
                  
                     Anſw. In regard of ſuperfluitie they may and ought to be ſtinted, but not in regard of ſufficiencie. It is not meet that all ſeruants ſhould haue as much as they can deuoure: for then many of them would doe but little worke: but moſt meet it is that euery one ſhould haue as much as is needfull for ſtrength, that ſo he may be the better able to doe and endure his worke: the Greeke word tranſlated in the 
                        Luk. 12. 42. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . place before quoted portion, implieth as much.
                  There is a double bond to tie maſters to performe this dutie: one in regard of themſelues: the other in regard of their ſeruants.
                  Maſters themſelues ſhall haue the profit and benefit of the health and ſtrength of their ſeruants: for their owne ſakes therefore it is requiſite to afford them ſufficient food. Men that deſire to haue their worke well done by their beaſts, or in their iourney to be well carried to the end thereof, will be carefull that their beaſts ſhall be well fed.
                  But beſide this, conſidering the health and ſtrength of ſeruants is ſpent in their maſters buſineſſe, iuſtice requireth that their health and ſtrength ſhould be repaired and preſerued by them.
               
            
            
               §. 24. Of defect and exceſſe in allowing ſeruants food.
               
               There are two extremes contrary to this dutie. One of thoſe that are too niggardly, and (as we ſpeake) miſerable in the allowance of food to their ſeruants: and that ſometimes in the quantitie, when ſeruants bellies are too much pinched: euen ſo as their bodies are weakned for want of food. The Prodigall

childe was thus ſerued: theſe are both vniuſt and iniurious 
                     Luk. 15. 16. maſters: vniuſt to their ſeruants: iniurious to their ſeruants, and themſelues too. Sometimes againe ſuch miſerable maſters offend in the qualitie of that food which they giue to their ſeruants, as when it is kept too long, and growne muſty, mouldy, or otherwiſe vnſauoury: or when the worſt kinde of food, for cheapneſſe ſake, is bought, euen ſuch as is ſcarce fit for mans meat: the more abundance that there is of ſuch ſtuffe, the more loathſome it is.
               Laſtly, though I thinke it not meet to binde maſters vnto ſet houres for their ſeruants meales (Chriſt affordeth a greater 
                     Luk. 17. 7, &c.
                   libertie vnto maſters, in the parable of a maſters vſage of his ſeruant after he came from his worke) yet there may be a fault, as there is, in many maſters, in keeping their ſeruants too long from meat, not ſuffering them to interrupt their worke for meat ſake, but to tarry for their ſupper till ten a clocke at night, when they giue ouer worke: ſurely this cannot be good for the bodies health and ſtrength.
               Another extreme doe ſuch maſters fall into, as bring vp their 
                  
                     Pro. 29. 21. 
                  ſeruants too delicatly. Solomon hath expreſly taxed ſuch, and noteth that this miſchiefe is like to follow thereupon, he ſhall haue him become his ſonne at the length: ſuch a ſeruant will forget his place, ſcorne to be as a ſeruant, but aſpire to be as his maſters childe, which is next to a maſters mate.
            
            
               §. 25. Of maſters care about their ſeruants apparell.
               
               A wiſe care for ſeruants cloathing is alſo commended in the example of Solomons good houſewife, She is not afraid of the ſnow for her houſhold, that is, for the coldeſt ſeaſon in winter, for all her houſhold are clothed with 
                  
                     Pro. 31. 21. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  double garments: that is, with ſuch clothing as is fit for cold weather.
               Fit and decent apparell is both a meanes of preſeruing health, and alſo a matter of good report, tending to the credit of a maſter. Yet contrary is the humour of many: they care not how tagged and ragged their ſeruants apparell is: inſomuch as many ſeruants haue neither comely nor warme apparell.
               The Hebrew word is oft vſed for ſcarlet. But according to the proper notation of it, it ſignifieth things doubled: which I take to be moſt pertinent to this place, and therefore I haue ſo tranſlated it. The Kings tranſlators haue noted as much in the margin.
            
            
               
                  
This point concerneth thoſe maſters eſpecially that finde their ſeruants (as we ſpeake) and prouide all things for them: as in old time maſters did for moſt ſeruants, and as now they doe for prentiſes whether male or female. If ſeruants by couenant be at their owne finding for apparell, maſters are not ſo ſtrictly bound therein: yet they muſt haue a care that their ſeruants fall neither into the one extreme of too baſe, ſlouen-like, or ſluttiſh apparell, nor into the other of too gariſh, or too coſtly apparell. Maſters hauing authority ouer their ſeruants, muſt keepe them in order and good compaſſe, and haue reſpect to decencie in this as in other things. For apparell is one of thoſe outward ſignes whereby the wiſdome of maſters and miſtreſſes in well gouerning their ſeruants is manifeſted to the world. If therefore ſeruants be attired vnſeemly for their place and abilitie, all that ſee them will thinke their maſters and miſtreſſes are of ſuch a minde as the ſeruants are, or at leaſt too remiſſe and careleſſe of their gouernment.
            
            
               §. 26. Of moderating ſeruants labour.
               
               Though labour and paines be proper to a ſeruants place, yet he may be ſo put vnto it, as the health and ſtrength of his body may be impaired thereby. For the well ordering of this therefore a dutie lieth vpon maſters: and that in two things eſpecially.
               1. That they well moderate the labour whereunto they put their ſeruants, ſo as they may be able for the time to vndergoe it, and to endure ſo long as their time of labour is appointed. It was a good reaſon which Saul rendred to keepe Dauid from 1 Sam. 17. 33. entring combat with Goliah, becauſe (as he thought) Dauid was not able to fight againſt the Philiſtim, Dauid being a youth, and Goliah a man of warre.
               
               And indeed if Dauids faith had not exceeded the ſtrength of his body, it had beene vnmeet to haue put Dauid to that taske.
               They which are put to things aboue their abilitie, are like to faile, and ſinke vnder the burden of them.
               It is contrary hereunto to put ſeruants to ſuch hard taskes

as impaire their ſtrength, endanger their lims, and venture their liues. Saul ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt ſuch: for he ſuppoſing that it was too hard a taske for Dauid to vndertake combat with Goliah, was loth to put him to it. Dauid exceedingly 1 Sam. 17. 33. failed herein, when he gaue direction that Vriah ſhould be ſet in the forefront of the hotteſt battell, and yet the Generall 2 Sam. 11. 15, with his ſtrength to retire from him. Many ſeruants being put to ſeruices aboue their ſtrength, either loſe their liues thereby, or (as we ſpeake) are neuer their owne men againe.
               It is alſo a fault in this kinde, to put ſeruants to ſuch toiling 
                     Memineris ſeruos homines eſſe. Cato. Exo. 1. 13, 14. workes as are fitter for beaſts then men: or to oppreſſe them with too much worke, as the Egyptians oppreſſed the Iſraelites. Let Gods hearing the cry of thoſe ſeruants ſo oppreſſed, and reuenging their oppreſſors for it, make all maſters take heed 
                     & 3. 7. of the like crueltie.
            
            
               §. 27. Of affording ſeruants fit meanes for their worke.
               
               2. The other thing required of maſters for wel ordering their ſeruants worke is, that they afford their ſeruants things needfull, and behouefull for that worke whereunto they are put: which minde was commendable in Saul, who aſſaied if his 1 Sam. 17. 38. armour might be fit for Dauid when he was to goe againſt Goliah. To reckon vp all the particulars were an infinite taske: euery ſeuerall trade and worke hath proper meanes of helpe appertaining to it: this generall direction may be ſufficient to moue maſters to applie it to the particular workes and ſeruices whereunto they put their ſeruants. Fit meanes are ſuch an helpe, as that which with them may eaſily be done, without them can hardly, if poſſibly at all be done.
               It is contrary hereunto to deale with ſeruants as the Egyptians did with the Iſraelites, exacting worke at their hands, and 
                     Exo. 5. 7. not affording them meanes to doe it: whereby many times they exact impoſſibilities. Some will haue much worke done in the night time, and not afford candle light: ſo in other particulars.
            
            
               §. 28. Of affording ſeaſonable reſt to ſeruants.
               
               Intermiſſion, eaſe, and reſt from labour at ſeaſonable times, is as needfull and requiſite, as food and apparell. The reaſon which God rendreth of the fourth commandement ſheweth

that maſters ought to afford reſt to their ſeruants: it is this, that 
                  
                     Deut. 5. 14. 
                  thy ſeruant may reſt.
               
               Without intermiſſion and reſt the body cannot endure labour: it will wax weake, faint, and vtterly vnable to continue: but, as labour decaieth ſtrength, ſo reſt repaireth it.
               There are two eſpeciall times of reſt, which ſeruants may not be denied.

                     1. The reſt of the night.
                     2. The reſt of the Lords day.
                  
               
               The firſt is ordinary for all liuing creatures: for it was one Seruants muſt reſt in the night time. principall-reaſon why God cauſed the light of the Sunne to be withdrawen from the face of the earth, that the inhabitants thereof might reſt from their labour. Vntill the euening man 
                     Pſal. 104. 23. goeth forth vnto his labour and worke. Time of darkneſſe is more fit for reſt then worke. Let not this be ſo taken as if no worke were to be done, after the light of the day is taken away: (then would but little worke be done in the depth of winter, when the daies are ſhort: and then would not God haue afforded artificiall lights) but to ſhew that difference muſt be made betwixt the day and night: and that the night is afforded for that time wherein men are moſt to reſt.
               The other time of reſt (being the Sabbath day) is by diuine Seruants muſt reſt on the Lords day. Gen. 2. 3. inſtitution. It was ſanctified vnto man in the time of Adams innocency, when he ſtood as a publike head and ſtocke of all mankinde. The very name Sabbath, (which in Hebrew ſignifieth reſt) and the expreſſe prohibition of doing any worke on that day, doe ſhew that it is a day of reſt: and that one end thereof was for ſeruants to reſt therein, is euident by the reaſon thereof, that thy ſeruant may reſt. So as there is a double bond to tie maſters to afford reſt to their ſeruants on the Lords day:

                     1. The bond of piety to God.
                     2. The bond of charity to ſeruants: for in that God did thinke it meet for ſeruants to reſt one day in ſeuen, we ought to Maſters who afford not time enough of ſleepe to ſeruants offend. thinke that it is needfull and behouefull for them.
                  
               
            
            
               §. 29. Of denying ſeaſonable reſt to ſeruants.
               
               Contrary to both the forenamed times of reſt doe many maſters offend: as firſt, they who make their ſeruants watch

too long at night, and againe, riſe too ſoone in the morning, not affording ſo much time of reſt and ſleepe as is needfull for refreſhing their bodies, and repairing their ſtrength: whereby it commeth to paſſe that (beſide the wrong done to their poore ſeruants) their worke cannot be done ſo well.
               
                  
                     Obiect. It is ſaid of the forenamed good houſwife, that her 
                     
                        Pro. 31. 18. 
                     candle is not put out by night.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. That is a tropicall ſpeech: and ſome-what hyperbolicall. The word night is put for a part thereof. The phraſe only implieth vigilancy, ſhewing that ſhe is not, as many, in the euening betimes in bed, and in the morning late vp; but late downe and early vp. This phraſe (ſhe riſeth while it is yet night) 
                     
                        Verſ. 15. vſed before, ſheweth that that which I haue noted, is the true ſenſe. If not putting out her candle by night, ſhould imply a ſitting vp all night long, how could it be ſaid that ſhe riſeth vp?
                  
               
               
                  
                     Queſt. What time may be thought ſufficient to afford ſleepe How long time for ſleepe to be allowed. vnto ſeruants?
                  
                     Anſw. As the ſame quantity of food is not ouer-ſtrictly to be proportioned to all alike, ſo nor the ſame continuance of ſleepe. Yet by experience it hath beene obſerued that for ſound and healthy bodies, fiue houres is the leaſt time that may be allowed, and ſeuen houres is time ſufficient for any.

               2. By ſending them vp and downe on that day on many errands, as to gather vp debts, or to doe ſuch other ſeruices as they are loth to afford time for on other daies.
               3. By making that the greateſt day of paines and labour, namely to ſuch as are in the kitchin, or haue any other buſineſſe about feaſts: for the Lords day is by many ordinarily made a day of feaſting.
               4 By keeping them vp too late on Saturday nights: euen till one of the clocke. Many that make ſome conſcience of the Lords day vſe to offend herein: for that their ſeruants might

not worke on that day, they keepe them vp till the very moment that they thinke the Sabbath beginneth: but herein they commit a double fault: one in not allowing their ſeruants ſufficient time of reſt: another in making them vnfit through want of ſleepe to doe the holy ſeruices of the Lords day.
            
            
               §. 31. Of allowing time of recreation to ſeruants.
               
               Concerning times of recreation, I may ſay as the Apoſtle doth in another caſe, I haue no commandement of the Lord, 
                  1 Cor. 7. 25. namely expreſſe commandement to preſſe vpon the conſcience of maſters any ſet time for recreation: yet queſtionleſſe it is very meet that ſeruants ſhould haue ſome times to refreſh themſelues this way: for recreation rightly vſed is a great meanes to put life, and adde ſpirit, to youth eſpecially. With worke and buſineſſe not only mens bodies, but their mindes alſo are occupied and imployed: herein the labour and trauell of men differeth from the labour of beaſts: for refreſhing therefore both of body and minde is good and moderate recreation needfull. But I referre this point to the wiſe conſideration of maſters themſelues, who may better by their owne obſeruation diſcerne what in this kinde is fitteſt, then we preſcribe.
            
            
               §. 32. Of maſters care ouer their ſeruants in ſickneſſe, and after death.
               
               Maſters prouident care for the good of their ſeruants is not to be reſtrained to the time of their health, but to the time of their ſickneſſe alſo, if it pleaſe God to viſit them while they are in ſeruice. Wherefore all things needfull are in this caſe to be prouided for them by their maſter. Firſt ſpirituall comfort for their ſoule, that ſo they may the better beare their infirmity: then ſuch things as may for the preſent giue them eaſe and refreſhing, and alſo, if it pleaſe God to adde his bleſſing, worke a recouery. The care of the Centurion for his ſicke ſeruant is 
                     Matt. 8. 6. in Scripture commended: he did as much for his ſeruant as he could haue done for his ſonne: The King of Arams care alſo 2 King. 5. 6. was in this kinde commendable: he did not forbeare to write to his enemie, and to make himſelfe beholding to him, in the behalfe of his ſeruant that was leprous.
               If the ſeruant haue beene formerly a faithfull, diligent, and 
                     Reaſons. 1. Recompence. profitable ſeruant, recompence requireth as much. For it is

a moſt vnkinde, and inhumane part to denie that ſeruant ſuccour in ſickneſſe, who in health hath beene profitable to his maſter.
               But if a maſter be carefull of his ſicke ſeruant, affording vnto 2. Future benefit. him the beſt meanes he can for his eaſe, and recouery, and that ſeruant, through Gods bleſſing vpon the meanes, recouer, he will, if he haue any ſparke of goodneſſe in him, hold himſelfe ſo obliged to his maſter, as he ſhall neuer be able to make ſufficient recompence: and thereupon be moued to vſe all the diligence he can for his maſters good: ſo that a maſter may reapebenefit to himſelfe by this kinde of kindneſſe.
               But though the ſeruant that is ſicke haue in former time 3. Charity. beene vnprofitable, and there be little hope of future benefit by him, yet for charity ſake, and in ſubiection to Gods diſpoſing prouidence, whereby that ſeruant is fallen ſicke in his maſters houſe, muſt he in that caſe be well looked vnto. If the Samaritan 
                     Luke 10. 33, 34. did well in taking care of a meere ſtranger out of his houſe, becauſe he ſaw him ſuccourleſſe, ſurely that maſter which neglecteth his ſeruant that is ſicke in his houſe, doth very ill.
               
                  1. Queſt. What if he be not a couenanted ſeruant for a ſet time, but a Iourney-man at will, or one that worketh by the day or weeke?
                  
                     Anſw. Though a maſter be not ſo much bound to ſuch an one, yet if he fall ſicke in his houſe, he may not in that caſe thruſt him out of doores, vnleſſe he know where he may be wel prouided for.
               
               
                  2. Queſt. What if a maſter be poore, and not able to prouide that which is requiſite for a ſicke perſon?
                  
                     Anſw. If the ſicke perſon haue friends and kindred that are better able, they muſt prouide for him: if not, the Church muſt helpe: but it is the maſters duty, to make the ſicke mans caſe knowne to his friends, or to the Church.
                  If, after all good meanes are vſed for recouery, the ſeruant Seruants that die, to be decently buried. die, his maſter muſt ſee the laſt duty in ſome ſeemely manner, performed for him, which is Chriſtian buriall. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt the vſage of mens bodies which after death ſhall be raiſed againe, and beaſts that vtterly periſh.

                     Iaakobs care of burying his mothers nurſe is expreſly mentioned, 
                        Gen. 35. 8. in way of commendation.
               
            
            
               §. 33. Of neglect of ſeruants in ſickneſſe: and when they are dead.
               
               Many maſters much offend in the contrary to the forenamed duties. For
               1. Some, when they obſerue their ſeruants begin to be ſicke, will put them out of their houſes, and leaue them to ſhift for themſelues, as that cruell Amalekite who left his ſicke ſeruant 1 Sam 30. 13. abroad in the fields. But note the vengeance of God which followed thereupon: The leauing of that ſicke ſeruant in that caſe was the occaſion of the deſtruction of that maſter and all his company. By that meanes they were diſcouered to their enemies.
               2. Others, when they cannot remoue their ſicke ſeruants out of their houſe, will ſuffer them there to lie ſuccourleſſe, and to periſh for want of things needfull. Many rich men that are able to prouide well enough for them, will ſend them to ſome out, backe roome, and take no more care for them. In this kinde many of them ſhew more kindneſſe to a dogge, or other beaſt that is not well, then to a ſeruant. An inhumane part.
               3. Others, that ſeeme not ſo inhumane, deale too hardly with their ſeruants in ſuch a caſe: they will afford them things needfull, but all at the poore ſeruants coſt: and if thoſe ſeruants haue not preſent money, they will cut it off their wages if they recouer health to doe them ſeruice. Is this to vndoe the heauy burdens? Or is it not to lay burden vpon 
                     Iſa. 58. 6. burden?
               4. Others, that are at ſome charges for their ſeruants ſickneſſe, doe ſo mutter at their ſeruants, and fling out ſuch diſcontented ſpeeches (namely, that they tooke them for their worke, and not to keepe them in their bed: to get ſome thing by them, not to be at ſuch coſt with them: or that they make themſelues more ſicke then needs: they may riſe, if they will, (with many other like diſcontented ſpeeches) that the poore ſicke ſeruants are more grieued and troubled with their maſters diſcontent, then with their ſickneſſe: and oft moued to

ſtriue aboue their ſtrength to riſe, euen when death is ſeaſing vpon them, and ſo haſten the approach of death.
               5. Many that may be carefull enough of the bodily eſtate of their ſeruants in ſickneſſe, See. §. 21, 22. haue no reſpect at all to the ſpirituall comfort of their ſoules, they neither giue them a word of comfort themſelues, nor ſend for miniſter or any other to doe it: but let them in this reſpect lie, and die as beaſts. Of all points of vnmercifulneſſe this is the greateſt: and moſt vnbeſeeming Chriſtians.
               6. Others, if their ſeruants die, will ſcarce afford them a winding ſheet, but ſay, let any one that will, burie them for their clothes.
               Notice is to be taken of theſe in humane cariages, that the deteſtation of them may make other maſters more tender hearted towards their ſeruants.
            
            
               §. 34. Of maſters prouiding for the future eſtate of ſeruants.
               
               Next to the Soule, and Body of ſeruants, maſters muſt haue ſome care of their eſtate: and that not only to keepe them while they are in their ſeruice, but alſo to endeuour and prouide that they may liue of themſelues, and doe good to others. When ſhall I prouide for mine owne houſe? ſaith Iaakob to his 
                     Gen. 30. 30. maſter. Which expoſtulation ſheweth that this is a maſters dutie.
               Contrary is the mind of moſt maſters: for in entertaining ſeruants they thinke of nothing but ſeruing their owne turne. Whence it commeth to paſſe that when maſters die many ſeruants are put to very hard ſhifts. Some forced to beg, others moued to filch and ſteale. Thus caterpillars are nouriſhed to annoy the common-wealth.
               That I may not be thought to lay the care of parents on maſters, and to equall ſeruants with children, I will note out foure particulars which will ſhew what manner of care and prouidence it is that is here required of maſters in regard of their ſeruants eſtate.
               One is, that maſters accuſtome their ſeruants to paines.
               Another is, that they exerciſe them in ſome vſefull calling.
               A third is, that they giue them ſufficient wages.
               
                  
A fouth is, that after ſufficient ſeruice they ſuffer them to prouide for themſelues.
            
            
               §. 35. Of well imploying ſeruants.
               
               That charge which the maſter gaue to his ſeruants when he was going abroad (occupie till I come) ſheweth that maſters 
                     Luk. 19. 13. muſt keepe their ſeruants exerciſed and imployed about ſome buſineſſe or other: which is alſo implied vnder this part of a good miſtreſſes commendation, ſhe giueth a portion to her maidens, 
                  
                     Pro. 31. 15. meaning a portion of worke. As there is neuer an idle member in a naturall body, but euery one is imploied, ſo ſhould it be in a family.
               1. Thus ſeruants being, while they are in ſubiection, inured to paines, they will be more induſtrious when they are of themſelues: yea they will both more willingly vndergoe, and more eaſily goe thorow matters which require paines and diligence. Uſe maketh perfect.
               
               2. Thus will maſters themſelues, and others afterward receiue the more profit, and greater benefit by them.
               3. Thus will many temptations be auoided, and euils preuented: continuall imployment to the corrupt nature of man is as a running ſtreame which carrieth away all the mud and filth in a brooke, ſo as none ſetleth there.
               It is contrary hereunto to harbour idle-packes in a mans Contrary. houſe: to giue meat, and drinke, and lodging to ſuch as doe no worke at all. The Apoſtle expreſly commanded, That if 
                  2 Theſ. 3. 10. 
                  any man would not worke, neither ſhould he eat.
               
               Theſe are not only a prey to the deuill, but alſo inſtruments of the deuill, by which he worketh much miſchiefe: for theſe are they that are moſt ready to diſcouer the ſecrets of an houſe, to be tatling of euery thing that is done, to ſort themſelues with all companies, and not content to doe no good themſelues, diſturbe, interrupt, and draw away ſuch as are buſie at their worke.
            
            
               §. 36. Of exerciſing ſeruants to a calling.
               
               Though it be a good thing to keepe a ſeruant alwaies occupied and imploied, yet for the benefit of the ſeruant it is further requiſite, that his imployment be about ſome ſetled matter, whereabout he may alſo exerciſe himſelfe when he is out

of ſeruice. This eſpecially concerneth ſuch as haue taken Maſters muſt teach their prentiſes their trade. prentiſes. They muſt teach them their trade.

                     1. For that end are prentiſes bound to maſters.
                     2. The couenants on the maſters part require as much.
                     3. The good which thence is like to come to the maſter himſelfe, his prentiſe, and others, will recompence the paines.
                  
               
               Other ſeruants alſo muſt be tied to a worke which may be a meanes of maintenance: as in a great houſe, to offices about that houſe: in the country, to husbandry: in offices about the law, to ſome imployment therein; and ſo in other callings.
               It is contrary hereunto for maſters to enuy their prentiſes the myſterie of their trade: to imploy them from time to time about meſſages, and errands, and ſuch things as tend only to the maſters preſent need, but cannot be profitable for the ſeruants in time to come. Theſe are like old, growne, broad trees, which keepe all the ſunſhine from the ſhrubs that grow vnder them, and ſo keepe them downe from growing.
               
                  
                     Obiect. Prentiſes will be as iuy to the trees about which they cling, ſoone ouer-topping them, and foking all the life out of them: they will hinder their maſters trading, and get away all his cuſtome, if they be too expert in his trade.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. This is but a meere ſurmiſe. It implieth that ſuch maſters as feare that which is pretended, deale not ſo currently, and faithfully with their cuſtomers as they ſhould; or elſe how could they ſurmiſe that wiſe chapmen would leaue one of whom they haue had long and good experience, to goe to a new beginner?
                  2. Daily experience ſheweth that God by his prouidence ſo ordereth mens affaires, that maſters who from time to time traine vp and ſend forth many prentiſes well exerciſed and skilfull in their trade, doe hold on, yea and increaſe in their owne dealings and gaine which they get thereby; and yet withall their prentiſes alſo come well forward. Why ſhould any maſters ſo diſtruſt Gods prouidence, as to be afraid to make their prentiſes skilfull in their trade?
                  3. When maſters by death or otherwiſe giue ouer trading, how ſhall trades be continued, if maſters be ſo enuious, and diſtruſtfull? What if their maſters had ſo dealt with them?

And what if all maſters ſhould ſo deale? For what one doth in ſuch a caſe, he muſt preſuppoſe that all may doe.
                  In this kinde alſo doe ſuch miſtreſſes offend as keepe their maids many yeares together to drudgery worke, and neuer teach them, nor afford them meanes or leiſure to learne points of huſwifery, things whereby they may get better maintenance for themſelues.
                  Such maſters and miſtreſſes vſe their ſeruants as beaſts, only for their owne turne, without any reſpect to the ſeruants good: whereby they peruert the maine end of that relation betwixt maſter and ſeruant, which is a mutuall and reciprocall good to paſſe from the one to the other.
               
            
            
               §. 37. Of appointing to euery ſeruant his particular function.
               
               For the better exerciſing of ſeruants vnto ſome calling, let theſe Directions for fitting ſeruants to ſome function. directions be noted.
               1. That maſters appoint to their ſeruants their proper and peculiar worke, that they may know what to doe, and wherein to exerciſe themſelues. And if there be many ſeruants in one houſe, to ſet vnto euery one their diſtinct function. The phraſe before noted of the good miſtreſſe (ſhe giueth a portion to her maidens) 
                  
                     Pro. 31. 15. proueth thus much. This was one thing which the Queene of Sheba obſerued and admired in Solomons houſe, the ſtanding of 
                  1 King. 10. 5. 
                  his ſeruants, namely, euery one in his owne place, at his owne taske. To this purpoſe it is noted, that the great maſter gaue to 
                     Matt. 25. 15. each of his ſeruants their diſtinct talents. It is thus in the bodie naturall: euery member is not only imployed, but alſo imployed 1 Cor. 12. 8. &c. Quod plurimorum commune eſt, in eo procurando minima diligentia adhibetur. Rerum enim propriarum maximam curam habent, communium autem minorem. Ariſt. de Repub. l. 2. c. 3. in his owne function: the eye in ſeeing, the eare in hearing, the foot in ſtanding or going, and ſo the reſt. It is thus alſo in Chriſts myſticall bodie: one hath the ſpirit of wiſdome, another of knowledge, another of faith, and ſo in other gifts. Thus alſo ought it to be in a familie where are many ſeruants.
               This is an eſpeciall meanes to make euery one the more diligent and faithfull. For when euery one hath his particular worke, they know, that they in particular are to giue an account thereof: ſo as if it be not done, or ill done, they ſhall beare all the blame: if done, and well done, they ſhall haue all the praiſe.
               2. Thus ſhall euery one be made skilfull and expert in ſome

thing, by continuall attending vpon it, and exerciſing themſelues therein.
            
            
               §. 38. Of diſorder in families through maſters negligence.
               
               The great diſorder which is in many families is contrary hereunto: for there are many maſters that hauing ſundry ſeruants doe looke that all things ſhould be well done, and yet appoint no particular place or worke to any one; but thinke and ſay, that euery one ſhould be forward to doe euery thing; and when they finde Praeter alias cauſas eoſunt in rebus communibus negligentiores, quod eus alijs curae eſſe exiſtiment: quemadmodum euenire ſolet in miniſterijs ſervilibus. Ariſt. loc. citat. not things done to their minde, they fret and fume, and complaine that they keepe ſo many ſeruants, and yet nothing well done. Such ſeruants are not free from all blame: but ſurely the maſters haue greateſt cauſe to complaine of themſelues, and of their owne diſorder in gouerning. For their negligence in appointing no ſet worke to their ſeruants, is the cauſe that all is neglected. For where many things to be done are left to many ſeruants, one will put off this, and another that, and ſay it belongeth not to them. Thus is it verified, that what is ſpoken to all is ſpoken to none: and that generall charges, are no charges.
            
            
               §. 39. Of maſters ouerſeeing the wayes of their ſeruants.
               
               The ſecond direction is, that maſters vſe inſpection ouer their ſeruants, and haue an eye vpon their ſeruants, to ſee how they ſpend their time, and diſpatch the buſineſſe committed to them. The good miſtreſſe looketh well to the wayes of her houſhold. This 
                     Pro. 31. 27. Ruth 2. 4. is noted of Booz, that he went to his field to ſee what his reapers did.
               The eye of a maſter is a great motiue to make a ſeruant diligent and faithfull: for thus he knoweth that both his diligence, and alſo his negligence ſhall be ſeene, and accordingly dealt withall. Hence aroſe that prouerbe, The eye of the maſter maketh the horſe 
                  
                     Oculus Domini paſcit equum. Matt. 24. 48. 
                  fat. The conceit which the euill ſeruant had that his maſter delayed his comming, and ſo could not ſee what he did, made him ſo vnfaithfull as he was.
               If a maſters place will beare it, it is behouefull that he be preſent with his ſeruants, and as a good preſident goe before them. It is recorded of the good miſtreſſe, that ſhee riſeth and giueth a 
                  
                     Pro. 31. 13, 15. 
                  portion to her maids: ſhee is with them her ſelfe; ſhee worketh willingly with her hands. This note of difference is put betwixt a prouident thriuing maſter, and a diſſolute careleſſe maſter: This
                  
                  man ſaith to his ſeruants, goe yee: but that man ſaith, goe we; or thus, goe ſirs, and ga'w ſirs.
               
               It is contrary hereunto to let all goe (as we ſpeake) at ſix and 
                  Contrary, careleſneſſe. 
                  ſeuens; and neuer to ſee what ſeruants doe. How can ſuch expect that their ſeruants ſhould be diligent in doing that which tendeth to their maſters good, when they themſelues are negligent in ouerſeeing that which tendeth to their owne good? Such maſters as giue themſelues to gaming, and following their paſtimes all day long, doe much offend herein. So alſo ſuch miſtreſſes as ſpend all the morning in lying a bed and dreſſing themſelues (a cuſtome cleane contrary to that which is noted of the good miſtreſſe) 
                     Prou. 31. 15. and at noone when they come out of their chamber, chide and brawle, becauſe things are not more forward.
            
            
               §. 40. Of prouoking ſeruants to their dutie both by faire and foule meanes.
               
               The third direction is, that maſters vſe what meanes they can to prouoke and ſtirre vp their ſeruants to be diligent and faithfull: as in the firſt place, exhortation, admonition, perſwaſion, promiſes of reward, with other like faire meanes. Such were the meanes which Saul vſed to make his ſeruants faithfull vnto him, when he ſaid, Will the ſonne of Ieſſe giue euery one of you fields, and vineyards, 
                  1 Sam. 22. 7. &c. had the thing which he expected from them beene good, this manner of dealing with them had beene commendable. But if faire meanes preuaile not, then they may and ought to See §. 13. rebuke, threaten, and correct their ſeruants.
               And if ſeruants be impudent in ſinning, and neither faire nor foule meanes will reclaime them, they muſt then be thruſt out of doores. Note what the maſter in the parable ſaid to his ſeruant, Thou maiſt be no longer ſteward: to which purpoſe Dauid alſo 
                     Luke 16. 2. Pſal. 101. 7. ſaid, He that worketh deceit ſhall not dwell within mine houſe: he that telleth lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight.
               
               When Iſmael grew a ſcoffer at Gods word, Abraham thruſt 
                     Gen. 21. 9. &c.
                   him and his mother out of doores, and that by Gods appointment. The parable of cutting downe the fruitleſſe figtree may fitly be applied to this point: and the reaſon alſo there rendred (why combereth it the ground?) Why ſhould incorrigible ſeruants 
                     Luke 13. 7. &c.
                   take vp the roome of good ſeruants? yea why ſhould they remaine to inſect and peruert other ſeruants?
               
                  
                  Obiect.
                  This is ſo farre from helping ſeruants in their eſtate, as it may proue their vtter vndoing.
                  
                     Anſw. 1. They haue then none iuſtly to blame but themſelues, Iuſtice (in caſe of neceſſitie) muſt haue her courſe, though through the iniquitie of man ſome miſchiefe follow thereupon.
                  2. The execution of this on ſome, may make others better looke to themſelues.
                  3. It may make them that are thruſt out to be the more dutifull vnder another maſter, or more diligent in another courſe of life.
                  Contrary is their courſe who obſerue no courſe, or order A ſeruant is not for euery offence to be thruſt out of doores. in drawing on their ſeruants to doe their dutie, but begin with that which ſhould be laſt: nay only vſe that remedy which ſhould not be vſed, vnleſſe no remedy will ſerue the turne, which is to turne their ſeruants out of doores for euery ſmall occaſion. No inſtruction, perſwaſion, admonition, rebuke, threatning is vſed by many when their ſeruants haue offended, but this thunderbolt caſt at them, be gone, get you out of doores. If this were taken notice of as a fault, longer might ſeruants tarry in an houſe then ordinarily they doe: and more good might maſter and ſeruant reape one from another: yea and the ſecrets of an houſe be better kept; for the oft chopping and changing of ſeruants is it that maketh all things done priuatly in houſes to be blazed vp and downe.
               
            
            
               §. 41. Of paying ſeruants their wages.
               
               A third thing required of maſters in reſpect of the eſtate of their ſeruants, is to giue them their iuſt wages: euen this is included vnder that generall precept, 
                     Rom. 13. 7. 
                  render to all their dues: and more particularly expreſſed in the example of 
                     Matt. 20. 8. that maſter who hired labourers into his vineyard and at the end of their worke gaue them euery one their wages: yea there is an expreſſe 
                     Deut. 24. 15. law to this purpoſe.
               
                  Obiect.
                  Theſe places concerne labourers hired by the day.
                  
                     Anſw. Seruants are in the ſame ranke: and the ground for both is the ſame: for both worke for wages. Yea the argument will more ſtrongly follow from the leſſe to the greater thus, If a labourer and ſeruant for a day muſt haue his wages

iuſtly paid, much rather a ſeruant, and labourer for a yeere and yeeres.
                  1. A maſters couenant requireth as much: if there were no other bond, yet that bond whereby he voluntarily bindeth himſelfe, tyeth him in conſcienc thereto. Among the fruits of the Spirit 
                        Gal. 5. 22. 
                     S. Paul reckoneth Faith, meaning thereby fidelitie in keeping promiſe and couenant.
                  2. Common equitie and iuſtice requireth as much: for wages is as due for labour, as money for wares. Chriſt taketh it for an vndeniable principle, that 
                        Luke 10. 7. 
                     the labourer is worthy of his hire: ſo alſo doth 1 Tim. 5. 18. the Apoſtle.
                  This dutie is to be performed to ſuch as are hired for wages: of them that are found all things by their maſter, I ſpake §. 23, 25. before.
                  In giuing ſeruants their wages theſe three things are to be Direction for giuing wages. obſerued.
                  1. That there be a ſufficient competency of wages allowed: euen ſo much at leaſt as may ſerue to prouide ſuch neceſſaries as are fit for a ſeruant: for there is great reaſon, that he that worketh ſhould liue of his worke.
                  2. That it be giuen in due ſeaſon. 
                        Leu. 19. 13. Deut. 24. 15. God would not haue the labourers hire be vnpaid one night after it was due. The time couenanted by a ſeruant for his wages, is the ſeaſonable time: then he expecteth it: to that time he putteth his occaſions of vſing it: at that time therefore it ought to be giuen him.
                  3. That it be paid to the full, according to the couenant: the maſters promiſe, and the ſeruants need require as much.
               
            
            
               §. 42. Of maſters iniuſtice about their ſeruants wages.
               
               Iniuſtice contrary to the forenamed dutie of due paying their ſeruants wages is many waies committed.
               1. When maſters doe altogether detaine their ſeruants wages: 
                     Deut. 24. 15. Jam. 5. 4. this is a crying ſinne, which entreth into the eares of God.
               2. When they make their ſeruants aske for their wages againe and againe, euen till they be aſhamed: yea to ſtay and wait for it till they be forced to ſigh vnto God: or elſe to filch and ſteale to ſupply their neceſſities: though theſe maſters

haue not a purpoſe vtterly to defraud their ſeruants of their due, yet the putting them off, and delaying to pay it, putteth ſeruants, that for the moſt part haue but from hand to mouth, vnto great ſtraits: which the Lord well knew: and therefore 
                     Leu. 19. 13. Deut. 24. 15. expreſly forbad the detaining of a ſeruants hire one night. This therefore is a point not only of vnkindneſſe, but alſo of iniuſtice.
               3. When maſters alter and change the couenanted wages, and ſeeke to diminiſh it, as 
                     Gen. 31. 41. hard-hearted Laban did: they ſhew thereby that they repine at their ſeruants welfare, and ſeeke only themſelues.
            
            
               §. 43. Of ſuffering ſeruants to prouide for themſelues.
               
               A fourth thing required of maſters in regard of their ſeruants eſtate is, that after ſufficient ſeruice done they ſuffer their ſeruants to prouide for themſelues. This Iaakob required of Laban as a moſt equall and reaſonable matter, ſaying, 
                     Gen. 30. 30. 
                  when ſhall I prouide for mine owne houſe alſo? (as was §. 34. before noted in the generall.) This hath reſpect eſpecially vnto ſuch ſeruants as haue beene a long time with maſters as apprentiſes, and ſpent their time, labour, and paines only and wholly for their maſters good. 
                     Exod. 21. 2. Deut. 15. 12. Gods law tooke expreſſe order for ſuch, that after certaine yeeres ſeruice they ſhould goe free. So doe alſo the lawes of our land, eſpecially the orders of London.
               Herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt ſeruants (who are vnder ſubiection, and held to worke for their owne good) and beaſts (which are only for mans ſeruice, and good.)
               They therefore who are of a contrary minde, keeping ſeruants Contrary. as long as poſſibly they can, euen all their life long vnto hard labour, and vnder ſeruitude, deſerue to be ſerued with beaſts rather then men and women. This kinde of maſters rigour to their ſeruants is in particular noted to be 
                     Ier. 34. 16, 17. one of the cauſes of that great indignation of God againſt the Iewes, whereby he was prouoked to giue them ouer, as captiues to their enemies.
            
            
               §. 44. Of kindneſſe to be ſhewed to good ſeruants.
               
               As maſters muſt giue that which is iuſt to all ſeruants, ſo that which is §. 20. 
                  equall to them that deſerue it: that is, they muſt be of an anſwerable minde and diſpoſition to good, honeſt,

louing, kinde, faithfull ſeruants, who ſtand not ſo much vpon that which is exacted, as vpon that which they are able to doe for their maſters, and in that reſpect, as they ſee occaſion doe oft times much more then is exacted, or expected. Goodneſſe requireth goodneſſe; good will, good will; and this is to doe the ſame things. This kinde of Equitie conſiſteth in theſe and ſuch like particulars.
               1. Maſters muſt well eſteeme of ſuch good ſeruants: and haue them in high account. 
                     Gen. 15. 2, 3. 
                  Abram accounted his old good faithfull ſeruant as his childe, and till he had a childe thought of making him his heire. Great was that eſteeme which Potiphar 
                  
                     Qui vere patresfamilias ſunt, ſeruis in familia ſua tanquam filijs conſulunt. Aug. de Ciu. Dei, l. 19. c. 16. had of Ioſeph, when of a bondſlaue he made him ouerſeer ouer his houſe, Gen. 39. 4. Why is the title Father giuen to maſters, (2. King. 5. 13.) and the title Sonnes to ſeruants, (Ioſ. 7. 19. & 1 Sam. 24. 16.) but to ſhew that ſeruants ſhould beare a child-like affection to their maſters, and that maſters ſhould beare a fatherlike affection to ſuch ſeruants?
               2. Maſters muſt take notice of the goodneſſe, and kindneſſe of ſuch ſeruants: and manifeſt as much, both by giuing them due praiſe, and a good reward: both which are noted in the patterne of that great maſter who ſaid, well done thou good 
                  
                     Matth. 25. 21. 
                  and faithfull ſeruant, thou haſt beene faithfull ouer a few things, I will make thee ruler ouer many things. Thus will thoſe good ſeruants be the more encouraged to hold on, and others will be moued to imitate them. This incouragement doth the Apoſtle giue to all vnder authoritie, doe that which is good, and 
                  
                     Rom. 13. 3. 
                  thou ſhalt haue praiſe of the ſame. Which phraſe implieth that gouernours ought to praiſe thoſe that doe well.
               3. If ſuch ſeruants be accuſed of any hainous crime, maſters muſt not raſhly giue credit thereto, but rather thorowly ſift, and examine the matter. Herein Potiphar exceedingly 
                     Gen. 39. 19. failed, and by that meanes loſt ſuch a ſeruant as he could neuer get againe. If a good ſeruant doe by occaſion ſlip, and commit a fault, his maſter ought in wiſdome either to take no notice of it: or with ſome milde admonition paſſe it ouer: and not deale with him as with a lewd, graceleſſe ſeruant.
               4. When ſuch ſeruants (their couenanted time being expired) depart, their maſters muſt not let them goe away empty: 
                  
                     Deut. 15. 13.
                  
but helpe them in their mariage (as Moſes his maſter did) or 
                     Exod. 2. 21. in their ſetting vp, as the great maſter, who made his wiſe and faithfull ſeruant ruler ouer all his goods. 
                  
                     Matth. 24. 47.
               
            
            
               §. 45. Of vnkinde dealing with good ſeruants.
               
               Vnworthy they are of good and kinde ſeruants who are of a contrary minde: as many maſters are For
               1. Some make no difference betwixt ſeruants: but eſteeme of bad and good all alike: they thinke that the beſt ſeruants doe but their duty, therefore no extraordinary reſpect is to be borne towards them. But it is a point of wiſdome ſometimes to account a duty as a kindneſſe: eſpecially when good will of heart is ioyned with outward performance of duty.
               2. Others thinke it policy to take no notice of any ſeruants extraordinary faithfulneſſe and diligence to praiſe and reward the ſame, leſt it puffe them vp too much. But there is much more feare of ſeruants fainting, and waxing weary of doing good if they haue no incouragement, then of growing inſolent by incouragement.
               3. Others will be more ready to checke and rebuke ſuch for euery ſlip, and for failing in any thing, then others: becauſe others leſſe regard their rebuke: whereby they ſhew want of wiſdome in well managing their authority.
               4. Others when their ſeruants are about to goe away, or to marry, or to ſet vp, will ſeeke ſome occaſion or other to fall out with them, of purpoſe to ſend them away empty. Many will carry a faire face toward profitable ſeruants till the time of recompence commeth, and then beginne to frowne, as Laban 
                  
                     Gen. 31. 2. did. Yea ſo farre are ſome maſters from ſeeking the proſperity of faithfull, wiſe, diligent, skilfull ſeruants, as they will hinder 
                     Sic cum inferiore viuas, quemadmodum tecum ſuperiorem velles viuere. Senec. epiſt. 47. them in what they can, and keepe them downe: fearing leſt as their ſeruants riſe, they themſelues ſhould decay and fall. Theſe are both vnkinde, and vngratefull maſters. Would maſters be ſo dealt with by their ſuperiours? Thou oughteſt ſo to liue with thy inferiour, as thou wouldeſt haue thy ſuperiour liue with thee.
               
                  
                     Hitherto of maſters duties. The reaſons to moue them to performe their duties follow.
                  
               
            
            
               
               §. 46. Of the ſubiection vnder which maſters are.
               
               
                  Epheſ. 6. 9.
                  
                     
                        Knowing that your maſter alſo is in heauen: neither is there reſpect of perſons with him.
                     
                  
               
               There is in generall but one reaſon alledged by the Apoſtle, to prouoke maſters to doe their duties, but it is ſo laid downe as it compriſeth other forcible reaſons vnder it.
               The principall reaſon is taken from the ſubiection wherein maſters are.
               The other reaſons are taken from the deſcription of that authority vnder which maſters are: for it is ſuch an authority, as,
               1. In relation to it there is no difference betwixt maſter and ſeruant.
               2. It is farre ſurpaſſing all dignities on earth.
               3. It is moued with no outward reſpect of any thing.
               The firſt reaſon which declareth the ſubiection of maſters, in that they haue a maſter ouer them, putteth them in minde of that account which they are to make, and reckoning which they are to giue of the well vſing of their authority, and of their cariage towards ſuch as are vnder them. For they are but as ſtewards ouer fellow ſeruants: euery one of them therefore ſhall heare this charge, giue an account of thy ſtewardſhip. 
                  
                     Luke 16. 2.
               
               In this reſpect this reaſon is both as a ſpur, and as a curbe vnto maſters.
               As a ſpur, to pricke them on forward conſcionably to performe all thoſe duties which are required of them: for they haue a maſter that will take notice thereof, and reward them for it. As they approue, and recompence the good ſeruice which their ſeruants doe: ſo much more will their maſter approue and recompence them if they doe well. Doe maſters therefore looke that their ſeruants ſhould performe their duty? let them then performe theirs: for there is the ſame reaſon of both. Let this be applied to all the particular duties before mentioned.
               It is alſo as a curbe, to reſtraine maſters from doing any thing

to their ſeruants but what they can be able to iuſtifie vnto their owne maſter. With this curbe did God hold in the Iſraelites, ſaying, 
                     Leu. 25. 43. 
                  Thou ſhalt not rule ouer thy ſeruant with rigor, but ſhalt feare thy God. Ioſeph was held in with it, when he ſaid, 
                     Gen. 42. 18. 
                  This doe and liue, for I feare God. And Nehemiah, when he ſaid, 
                     Neh. 5. 15. 
                  The former Gouernours were chargeable to the people, but ſo did not I becauſe of the feare of God. And Iob, when he ſaid, 
                     Iob 31. 13, 14. 
                  If I did deſpiſe the cauſe of my ſeruant, when God viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him? Thinke of this ô maſters, when you are about to exact any thing of your ſeruants that is not lawfull or meet, when you are incenſed and in paſſion ſtirred vp to ſtrike your ſeruants vniuſtly or cruelly, when you detaine from them any thing that is their due, when you lay more on them then they are able to beare, when any way you wrong or oppreſſe them: thinke and ſay with your ſelues, can this be iuſtified? how ſhall we be able to hold vp our head to our maſter when he calleth vs to account? What ſtronger motiue to doe all dutie? what ſtronger reſtraint from all iniuſtice and rigour? The conceit which many haue that they are free, vnder none, to giue no account, maketh them both negligent of their owne dutie, and inſolent ouer others; as Pharaoh, who ſaid, 
                     Exod. 5. 2. 
                  Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him? and Sennacherib, who ſaid, 2 Chr. 32. 15. 
                  Shall your God deliuer you out of mine hands? and Nebuchadnezzar, who ſaid, 
                     Dan. 3. 15. 
                  Who is that God that ſhall deliuer you out of mine hands? Note the iſſue of this inſolency. Pharaoh after many extraordinarie plagues laid on him and his people, 
                     Exod. 14. 28. was drowned in the red ſea with all his hoſt. 
                     Iſa. 37. 36, 38. 
                  Sennacherib after his hoſt was deſtroied, was ſlaine by his owne ſonnes. 
                     Dan. 4. 30. 
                  Nebuchadnezzar became a very bruit. But to let theſe abominable blaſphemers paſſe, there be many maſters who, though they vtter not with their mouthes ſuch execrable blaſphemies, yet by their carriage towards their ſeruants ſhew themſelues to be little better minded, in that they make their owne will a rule to their ſeruants, and will haue them doe ſuch things as are vnmeet and vnlawfull, vſing their ſeruants as ſlaues, or rather as beaſts. Let all ſuch maſters know that they haue a maſter.
            
            
               
               §. 47. Of the equality betwixt maſters and ſeruants in relation to God.
               
               The ſecond reaſon in this particle alſo (your maſter alſo) declareth an equality betwixt maſters and ſeruants in relation to God. As God is the maſters of ſeruants, ſo he is the maſter of maſters alſo. As ſeruants are the Lords 1 Cor. 7. 22.

For howſoeuer in outward dignity there is great difference betwixt maſter and ſeruant, yet as the ſeruants of God they are of a like condition, and in many things may be accounted equall: eſpecially if both be of the ſame faith, and ſo brethren in Chriſt. This is another ſpur and curbe too.
               A ſpur in that God will the more kindly accept that goodneſſe which maſters doe to their ſeruants, becauſe it is done to Gods ſeruants.
               A curbe, in that ſeruants ſhall be heard before God as well as maſters, for he is the maſter of both.
               Many thinke that all the kindneſſe which is ſhewed to ſeruants is loſt, becauſe they are ſo meane as they are able to make no recompence. But their maſter is able.
               Others thinke, their ſeruants can neuer take any reuenge of them, and thereupon vſe them as they liſt. But the maſter of ſeruants, who is alſo the maſter of maſters, can take vengeance, euen ſuch as ſhall make maſters ſorely repent all the wrong they haue done.
               If maſters did duely weigh this point, that, howſoeuer in regard of outward gouernment there be ſome difference betwixt them and their ſeruants, yet before God they are as fellow ſeruants, would they be ouer-rigorous and cruell? would they not be kinde and gentle?
            
            
               §. 48. Of Gods being in heauen, how it is a motiue to prouoke maſters well to reſpect their ſeruants.
               
               The third reaſon (taken from the place of God, in heauen) declareth the ſurpaſſing excellencie of that great maſter, who is the common maſter of maſters and of ſeruants: and it addeth an edge to the former motiues.
               
                  
1. It ſheweth that though the wrong which maſters doe to their ſeruants be within the walls of their houſe, ſo as no mortall eye can ſee it, yet God who is in heauen ſeeth it: and though ſeruants cannot be admitted into the courts of men to make their complaint, yet heauen is open to them; to that great maſter that is in heauen they may haue acceſſe when they will. That which made the euill ſteward deale hardly with his fellowes, was the conceit 
                     Mat. 24. 48. which he had of his maſters abſence. But no ſuch conceit can they haue of this great maſter, who know that he is in heauen, and 
                     Pro. 15. 3. that as heauen is ouer euery place, ſo the eyes of the Lord are in euery place, and behold the euill and good: he ſeeth all the good, and all the euill that maſters doe to their ſeruants.
               2. It ſheweth that the kindneſſe which the Lord will repay, and the vengeance which he will inflict, is infinitely greater then the good or euill that maſters can doe to their ſeruants, euen as heauen i, higher then earth, and as he that is in heauen is greater then they that are on earth. Doeſt thou therefore, who art a maſter on earth, reioyce, or grieue the ſoule of thy ſeruant? God in heauen can much more make glad or ſad thy ſoule. Doeſt thou therefore deſire the fauour, or feare the frownes of thy maſter in heauen? ſhew fauour to thy ſeruant on earth, and forbeare threatning. Remember the infinite diſparitie betwixt thy maſterſhip and Gods, and this will the more moue thee to deale with thy ſeruant, as thou wouldeſt haue God deale with thee.
               3. It ſheweth that there is much more reaſon we ſhould take notice of our ſeruants, of their paines, of their diligence, and of their faithfulneſſe, then that God ſhould take notice of ours: and leſſe reaſon that we ſhould ſcorne, or neglect our ſeruants, then God ſcorne or neglect vs. For there is far greater difference betwixt God and vs, then betwixt vs and our ſeruants. We and our

                         vocas, exijſdem ſeminibus ortum, eodem fruicoelo, aequè ſpirare, aequè viuere, aequè mori. Senec. Epiſt. 47. ſeruants are all of the earth, of the ſame mould, nature, and diſpoſition, ſubiect to the ſame paſſion, and to the ſame diſſolution. (The heathen obſerued as much.) But God is in heauen, eternall, vnchangeable, euery way ſurpaſſing glorious. How can we then looke to be reſpected of this maſter, if we reſpect not our ſeruants? O maſters, in all your dealings with your ſeruants, remember your maſter is in heauen.
               
            
            
               
               §. 49. Of Gods impartiall reſpect of all.
               
               The fourth reaſon (in theſe words, neither is there reſpect of perſons with him) declareth Gods iuſt and equall manner of proceeding with all men, of what ranke and degree ſoeuer. God will doe the ſame things to all ſorts of maſters that they doe to their ſeruants. To the conſideration of this impartiall iuſtice of God doth the Apoſtle call maſters, both becauſe of that outward power which they haue ouer their ſeruants, and alſo becauſe for the moſt part maſters are backt with the power and authority of magiſtrates on earth, who in matters of difference betwixt maſter and ſeruant are ordinarily partiall, reſpecting maſters more then ſeruants.
               But let maſters here learne to caſt off all ſuch fond conceits, and fooliſh hopes. Though they be higher in place, haue more wealth, and better friends then their ſeruants, and though men who haue carnall eies may thereby be much moued to reſpect them, yet will not God goe an haires bredth from iuſtice for the whole world. If the greateſt man that euer was in the world ſhould haue a ſeruant that were the meaneſt that euer was, and a caſe betwixt that maſter and that ſeruant ſhould come before God, God would not any whit at all leane to that maſter more then to the ſeruant. If the greateſt that be abuſe the meaneſt, they ſhall not eſcape. Wherfore, O maſters, giue no iuſt cauſe of complaint to any ſeruant.
               The Apoſtles manner of ſetting downe theſe points, noted in this word (knowing) implieth that ignorance of God, of that authority which he hath ouer maſters, of that equality which in relation to God is betwixt maſters and ſeruants, and of Gods heauenly excellency, and impartiall reſpect towards all, maketh maſters to abuſe their power, by neglecting all dutie, and inſulting & tyrannizing ouer their ſeruants: wherefore you that haue heretofore beene ignorant of theſe points, now take knowledge of them; and you that know them, oft call them to minde: and doe that which becommeth good maſters, Knowing that your maſter alſo is in heauen, neither is there reſpect of perſons with him.
