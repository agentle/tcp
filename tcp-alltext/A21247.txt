            The first Parte answereth certaine Treasons pretended, that neuer were intended:
            And the second, discouereth greater Treasons committed, that are by few perceiued: as more largely appeareth in the Page folowing.

            The Argument of this Treatise diuided into two Partes.

The one,The one open & malicious. soeth and easie for euery man to perceiue, that he that wil not see it, shal yet feele and find it, whether he wil or no. That is to saie, how they labour to defame and discredit that vertuous Ladie y• Queenes Maiestie of Scotland, being Heire apparent to the Croune of England: to slaunder and deface that Noble Prince, the Duke of Northfolke, the chief Peere of that Realme: to blemmish and abase the reast of the Nobilitie, presently apprehended: to confirme & encrease the Princes di

That is to wit, how craftily and cunningly some do labour, to bleare and blind the eyes of the ignorant, like Craftes-maisters, I warrant you, seeking with many wrong pretenses, and with numbers of false shewes, to hide and couer those truthes, that do breake

               s and Treasons, supposed to haue bene conspired and attempted by those two Noble Princes (whiche by them, nor any other, were neuer thought on) to withdrawe thereby the eyes, and to diuert the mindes of the multitude, from beholding and falling into the reckening of those greater Treasons, that are in deede mo in number, more odious in qualitie, and neerer at hand, yea already a working, and contriued by them chiefly that send these Libels emongest you.
            Which kind of Coosoning, or rather coniuration, is passing necessary to be discouered, and more then high time, that it had ben done ere this: as wel for the peril of the practise finally meant, as for the mischieuous meanes vsed to bring it to passe. The final practise,A third finally intended is, to wrest the succession of the Croune from his du
                     •
                   course. I cal, the alteration of the succession of the Croune of that Realme, by vntimely extincting both those Lines, in which it presētly resteth, & shuld first fal vnto, by al lawes of

Nature, Nations, and your owne Countrey: and withal to cōfirme and establish vnto certaine base persons (vnder the Title of a third Family, vnto which them selues are lately vnited) the perpetuall Regiment of ye same, the possessiō whereof they haue already obteined. Whose ambitious mindes are so limed with the pleasant gaine of present gouernāce, that th
                  •
               y count both your Prince & Realme, and all the rest well aduentured, if them selues thereby may wynne that, which they aspire vnto.
            This, do I call, the finall purpose of the practise in hand. And therein shal I for this time rest, how so euer both wisedome, reason and experience would, that no man should looke for an ende thereof, when it were come to that: nor expec
                  •
                any lesse, but that when these two first Families shalbe weeded out for that third, that also shalbe weeded out for an other, and so that fourth, for a fyfth, tyll none be leaft of the blood Royal, but the Realme come to be gouerned, eyther by a Foreiner, or by a Popular State.
            And of the many mischieuous meanes

vsed to bring this purpose to passe,The meanes to altre the successiō are these. who can be ignorant, no man almoste being found of that Nation, that hath not tasted bitterly of them, by him selfe or his frind in more or in lesse? For who remembreth not, that to set vp a lawlesse Factiō of Machiauellian Libertines, that should not (by consciēce or feare of synne) be restrayned from any maner mischiefe, a new Religion was pretended,Heresie. that with helpe of Authority, shouldred out the olde: of purpose chiefely, to leaue none at all in the hartes of the people, to the ende,Atheisme. that a Rable of vnbridled persons might alwayes be readily found, whiche by no Religion, nor zeale of soule, should feare, with force and face impudēt, to execute, what so euer should be committed vnto them, by those that haue created and set vp the Faction.

                Woolf, that was

hidden vnder this Lambes skinne. Into the belly and bulke of this huge beast the Grecians had cunningly conueied a great number of their most valiant armed soldiers, who being once entred into that Citie, vnder that Horses hide, should (by Sinon) be let out of the beasts belie, and at an houre in the night agreed vppon before, should make themselues maisters of the Towne Gates, and let in the reast of the Grecian Armie, that would by that constituted time, be returned thither again
                  •
               .
            Now had the crafty Greek
                  •
               s a bird among them of their owne brood named Sinon, whom they made priuie, and a principal worker of al the Treason, as one, that had a deepe witte, a smooth tongue, an aspiring mind, a shamelesse face, no honour, litle honestie, and lesse conscience, and was a slie and suttle shifter to compasse whatsoeuer he would: and him they suborned, to take vppon him, not only to persuade King Priamus and the Troianes, to take in this Sacrifice, but to aduenture himself also to get into the Citie, to open the Engin

of that beast, and to let out those Soldiars, when the time should be.
            To be short: he accorded. And being of base birth, and vile courage, thought it no paine, to suffer shame & danger for a time, to leade the reast of his life out of y• low condition (in which he was borne) in perpetual honour and wealth afterward, which were promised him for his enterprise. And to winne creditte with King Priamus, he feined to haue bene cruelly handled, and threatned with tormentes and present death by his owne Nation: and that at their imbarking he should haue bene soorthwith offered in Sacrifice.
            And in this maner, putting himself wher he might be taken by the Troians, and pretending great deuotion to the Goddesse Pallas, he tempered his tale in 
                  •

            For, after the Horse was once in the Citie, Sinon, and his Mates so perfourmed their partes, and perfited their practise, that in the night, they let in the whole troupe of the Grecian Armie: who with great slaughter and crueltie, slew Priamus the King, murdered his Children, extincted his seede and Posteritie for euer, defaced and burned the Temple of the Goddesse, to whome they pretended the honour of that Sacrifice,

               Resemblances betweene that Storie and the present gouernment.This being in brief the effect of that Fable, as the Poets do fame it, or of that true Historie, as some others do thinke: behold, I beseche you, in reading this Treatise, by these few exāples folowing, how aptly & fully the same doth resemble y• Tragedie, that we are now to treat of.
            
                And first consider how iustly the

naughty nature, the false, cruel and crafty conditions of that insolēt and licencious Brotherhood, that, vnder pretense of a new Religion, do cal themselues a Partie Protestant, dispersed euery where, doth answere and may be compared to the suttletie, falsehood, and lewed propertie of the Greekish Nation, testified by a Prouerbe, vsual in your Language, that reprehendeth mens insolencie and outrage, with these termes: Ab Sir, you are a Greeke in deede.
            
            The modestie and conscience of the Catholike partie, that for feare of God, & for hate of sinne, do absteine from offer of iniuries, and defend onely their auncient possession in the Catholique Faith, and that with lesse care, zeale, and suspicion, then is necessary: may in euery part very aptly be resembled to the Nobl
                  •
                nature and royal dealings of the olde Troians, that, with lesse suspect of their Aduersaries malice, then was necessary, without offer of iniurie to their enemies, defended onely their auncient possession in their Kingdome.
            The violent assaultes, and forcible 
               
inuasions, made by the Protestantes vppon the Catholike Faith, for many yeres together by sundry cruel & penal Lawes, enacted by King Henrie, King Edward, and Q. Elizabeth: and by sundry rebellions, and conspiracies against Q. Marie, to bring the old Catholike regiment of that Croune, to a Protestant gouernment: do aptly answere, the ten yeares warre, and forcible siege made by the Grecians, against the Citie and Kingdome of Troie, to bring the Troian Dominion to the Grecian subiection.
            
                The slaughter of Noble Hector, and of sundry others of King Priamus children, done by force of Armes in the time of the si
                  •
               ge: may not vnaptly be compared, to the violent deathes of many noble & notable Personages, which in these late yeares they haue susteined: some by colour of Lawes, some by Treason, some by sodaine murder, & some by poison, as thei haue ben found likely to repugne or resist the intended change of yt regiment, from y• old gouernance in Catholike wise, to a new Dominion vnder the Protestantes,
            
                The repression of ye sundry rebellions,

& confederacies, made by the Protestants against Q. Marie, & their assault now, by suttletie & arte to winne that, which their force was to weake for: is iustly resembled to the Grecians shifting vnto suttletie and craft, when they had found their forces to feeble for their purpose.
            The fained retrait, & coūterfeit departing  of ye Greekes frō Troie, may be wel cōpared to ye false shew of yt coūterfeit clemēcie pretēded by yt Protestāts, for sundry y
                  •
               res after your Q. cōming to her Croūe: whiles they fained a retire, frō al forcible cōstraint of any Catholikes conscience, & pretended no intention of troubling any mā for keping or folowing his old Faith.
            The old Greekes, by hypocrisie, feined  a Sacrifice to Pallas, & vnder that cloke, couered their horrible fraud, with a commendable deuotion, that was cōmon, as wel to the Troians, as Grecians: yea by ye Grecians falsly in dede, & by ye Troians only, was faithfully meant: & these your new Greekes, wt as false a meaning, doe faine a Sacrifice of their ielousie & care for your Q. securitie, commonly tendred, both by Catholique and Protestant: yea

rather, but superficially fained by the Protestāts for a time, and sincerely meant by the Catholikes alone: vnder which is couered the odious practise, that no man would endure, if he might see it at first, as it wil shew it selfe at last.
            
                The deuise was a huge bulke of a hollow beast, that conteined no substance of that it gaue shew of, but was of a cleane cōtrary metal within: and these Greekes deuise is, a grosse and beastly flatterie, that hollowly promiseth al Honour, securitie, and quietnes of Raigne, al amitie abrode, and al obedient af

            The pretense of that olde Sacrifice was  plausible to the Troianes, and deceaued them the rather, bycause they were people deuoutly affected, to the feare of their Goddes: and this pretense of your Queenes securitie, is adored by al the Catholikes, and blindeth them the rather from the sight of the Treasons couered therin, bycause that by the limits of Religion, and feare of God, they affect in deede the preseruation of theire Prince.
            The Greekes charged the Troianes  with want of deuotion, and would put them in feare of the wrath of their Goddesse, if they refused her fained Sacrifice: and these Gre

            The chi
                  •
               f couered meaning of the olde  false sacrifice was, to winne the Kingdom

of old Troie, from King Priamus and his Posteritie: and one of the chief hidden meanings of this new practise, is, to winne y• Dominion of new Troie, from your Queene, and her next lauful Succession.
            
                In that hollow Horse of Sacrifice, were couered and conueied the mightiest armed enemies of al Troian blood: and in this hollow pretense and shew of securitie, are couered & conteined the Treasons, that tend to extirpe your present Priam, with sundrie of the neerest of her blood Roial.
            
                The bulke of that beast, being stuffed with Soldiers, was greater, then any Gate of the Citie could receiue or admit, and therefore must extraordinarily be let in by the Walles: & this pretense stuffed with so many horrible Treasons, is more huge, more hateful, & more odious, then would be admitted by any ordinarie passage: and therfore must by extraordinarie arte be winded into the creditte of your Prince and people, by an vnwoonted infamie, and ouerthrow of the innocent and guiltlesse.
            
               That false sacrifice was at first suspected, for a while doubted of, and refused by King Priamus and his Counsel, til the Greeke Sinon persuaded the admission of it, by making them beleue, that if they receiued the same and set it vp in their Citie, they should not only winne the grace and fauour of the Goddesse Pallas, but it should also saue and defend them, and make al Asia and other infinite Countreis become subiect to them and their posteritie. And this false semblance was both by your Queene, and her faithfull

            The olde Tragedie did ende, as you haue heard, in the ruine of the Temple of Pallas, whome those Greekes pretended to adore, in depriuing King Priamus and his Posteritie, when by Sino

            A TREATISE OF TREASONS against Q. Elizabeth and the Crowne of England: partly answering certaine Treasons pretended, that neuer were intended: and partly discouering greater Treasons committed, that are by few perceiued.
            
               THe Author seeming to write to a brother in law of his, to auoid superfluitie of vnnecessarie speaches, beginneth with a shorte and swete salutation of, Salutem in Christo, but what salutem he bringeth, or to whome he meaneth either health or wealth, let his owne wordes be iudge. I wil not by way of preuention

preiudice him so much, as out of his good wordes, to sucke his euil sense, til himself shal shew it: only here I wil warne thee, not to be hastily enamoured with the rest,B

               1. GOod men and euil delight in contraries. The good in seking for truth, and maintenance thereof: euil, in hiding of truth and oppressing thereof. And so consequently to publissh truth, is to please the good, and to displease the euill.
               THis beginning, good Reader, wil serue as wel my pur
                     •
                  ose, as mine Aduersaries: & so much the better, in how much to the truer sense and meaning I hope to applie it, saying thus: Euil men and good delight in con
                        •
                     raries: The euil in hiding of truth, in vttering

vntruth, and in shamelesse maintenance thereof. The good in reuealing their malice, in discouering their falsehod, and in bringing truth to light. And so consequently, to deuise vntruth, to publish lies, and by new and fresh lies to mainteine old lies, is the propertie of the euil, pleaseth the wicked, and offendeth the good.
               And therefore let not this glorious entrie & gay lines at first withdraw thee from the memorie of the wisemans counsel, that sheweth, that the suttelest kind of lying & likest to deceiue men, hath commonly an honest shew at beginning, and a face of truth: vnder whiche the malice and falsehood for the most parte, hideth it self, and lieth couertly vnspied. But when it commeth nakedly forth without visard or guile, that men may see it in the owne likenes: then are errours and lies euer mainteined by lying,Lyes by lying: and on
                        •

                     ined. and can neuer be vpholden by plaine nor true dealing, & vniust attempts are wrought by wretched steps and degrees, and can neuer be compassed by lauful meanes. Which two pointes I wish thee, Reader, to keepe in

memorie, and I doubt not, but to lay the proufe thereof so plaine before thee, ere this Treatise be ended, by the woordes and dedes of those that haue sette him a worke, that for thy satisfaction thou shalt desire no better trial nor proufe of the honour and innocencie of these Noble Princes, whome this Libel purposely is published to defame.
            
            
               2. Wherefore, hearing, that emongest the common sortes of men at this time it is not certainely knowen, what is the cause, that the Duke of Northfolke is newly committed to the Tower, and sundry others: and knowing that good men 
                     •
                  il be wel satisfied to vnderstand the truth, which euil men would couer and oppresse: I could not but in conscience, to satisfie the good, and bridle or stoppe the lying and open slaunderous mouthes of the euill and seditious, notifie thus muche vnto yow, whereby you may also cōmunicate the same to others: for that it is likely, that false and slaunderous reportes wil be readily made hereof, to serue the appetites of the euil disposed.
               
                  In this Paragraffe, good Reader, he pretendeth to shew the cause, that moued him to write, which was for conscience sake forsooth:The false pretense of conscience. euen for conscience pardie, and for nothing els, but to satisfie good folke and to stop the mouthes of the euil. Thus in any wise thou must vnderstand him, and take his meaning to be.
               By which wordes of his thou maist perceiue two things: the one, that either the writers vocation & function is such, that he hath some special cure and charge aboue others, not to permitte the people to misconstrue and missetake the causes and occasions of the Duke of Norfolkes new imprisonment and the reast: or els, that his conscience is more tender and scrupulous, then other mennes are of his calling, syns none pretend those causes, nor wil be acknowē to intrude them selues therevnto, but himselfe. And the other is, that if this Author had not taken this paine in hand, & disclosed these secretes to satisfie good folke: yt good sort els (yu seest) had ben like inough to haue thought & said better of the Duke & the others, then this mā would they should.
               
                  
                  For likely it is (saith he) that false and slaunderous reportes vvil be made of their impris
                        •
                     nment by seditious mouthes, to serue the appetites of the euil disposed.
               
               And by this he would lead thee to wene, that himself is no seruer of appetites, nor flatterer of authoritie: but hath taken this paine for conscience sake, chiefly to satisfie the good
                        •
                      and to stoppe the mouthes of the euil, that els wo
                     •
                  ld haue thought & spoken to wel of the Duke and the rest that be in prison: of whome to speake wel, thou seest, how heinous and grieuous a crime it is accompted, by the seuere punishment of an honest Citizen emong you, that lately on the pillorie lost one of his eares, onely for saying, that he thought, the Duke to be of more honour, and to beare to good an heart to his Countrie, to goe about those foule practises, that M. Recorder in the Yeld Hall had charged him with.
               Now regarding, good Reader, that whosoeuer shal take this matter otherwise, then this Author would haue him, must be accoūted by him, & by al that partie yt doth fauour & set him a worke, one of the euil sorte, one of the euil disposed, a

hider & oppressor of truth, a lying, open, & slaunderous & seditious mouth, & a ready reporter of slaunders to serue appetites: thou wilt graunt (I hope) that it behoueth, and is principally necessarie, that we vnderstand, this Writer, that must be our Author and warrant, to be a man of such credite and honestie, as vpon whom we may boldely change our opinion of those Noble persons, and build now a new conceipt of them, and take them for such, as he defameth th
                     •
                  m for, and from henceforth no more to thinke of them, as hitherto we haue done.
               For if it be muche, vpon the othes or wordes of any few to condemne & thinke ill of any knowen honest man neuer so meane, whose life hath geuen testimonie of his integritie against their affirmations: can any man thinke, the slaunderous and malitious pen of an vnknowen namelesse person (that spireth and breatheth out the spite and poison of the Writers hart) to be a good warrant for any wise man,The Libel is no warrāt to thinke yll of, &c. to thinke ill of so many principal persons, that so long haue deserued to be wel thought of, til now, and to condemne

them of so many grosse errours, as this lewde Libell laieth to their charge?
               Seeking therefore to find out and to know what this man is that telleth vs these secrete hidden crimes not knowen to the multitude, that conteine the disgrace and defacement of so many persons of importance, that I might somewhat waie his credite and authoritie, 
                     •
                  re I beleeue him so farre and grounde my self vpon him: we finde (you see) none other name nor description of him, but two bare consonantes of the Crosserow, scilicet, R. and G. which is a signification somewhat to general, so to commend vnto vs the credite or honestie of any knowen manne, as to make him our ground and warrant in suche a case, as this is, that toucheth our conscience and honestie before God and man.
               For when I studie to coniecture, whome those letters might signifie, I find that 
                     •
                  he letter R. representeth as wel Robert, as Richard, Roger, Rafe, and many other: and the l
                     •
                  tter G. to represent as wel, Goodfellow, as Grafton,

Goodman, Goose, or many other. And hauing occasion in this Treatise, to make often mention of this Author, with whome I deale, that indureth not (you see) to walke in the light, nor to be seene in the daie: I wot not of which name to make choise before other. But for the resemblance of his propertie and qualitie with that spirit or pooke that we cal Robin Goodfellow, or HobgoblinThe auth
                        ••
                      of the Libel plaieth Robin Goodfelow, and Hobgoblin. (by hiding his name and person stil in darkenes, by framing his speache so obscurely as shal abide no light of answere or trial, and by telling vs lyes stil and nothing els, as suche foule sprites are wonte to doe, and for that the letters of R. G. serue aptly therefore) I haue made choice to vse that name sometimes, as least offensiue to any particular man, whome I might els fortune to mistake.
               And if any man shal thervpon contend and thinke, that I presse him to much for his name to the Accusation,The partes of the Accuser and Answerer be far vnlike. syns my selfe addeth not mine owne to this Answer: I require, that the matter be but indifferently considered, and the difference betwene our persons and partes wayed in

equal balance, and than I doubt not, bu
                     •
                   the reason shal sone appeare to euery man of any iudgement, to be farre different and vnlike betwene him and me, and betwene his parte and mine. For he commeth (you see) to discredite and accuse by name, persons pearlesse in your common Weale, suche as whose disgrace with the people implieth a diuision in time betwene the Prince and the Subiect, betwene the Nobilitie and Commons: with the present personal confusion of the parties accused, that haue generally wel deserued of al men, that haue ben il thought of by no honest, nor good man, that are pitied and lamented by euery man of any good nature, as persons eminent in dignitie, vnspotted of life (where truth may be heard) and that haue geuen rare testimonie of their honour, vertue, wisedome and modest demeanour for many yeares together in al Coūtries where they haue liued, and in al actions and affaires fallen vnder their rule.
               Which good opinion once wonne and obt
                     •
                  ined vniuersally would require (thou wilt graūt, I suppose
                     •
                   more then the railing

termes of a nameless Libel, to derogate, to preiudice, to bleminish and spot it: & doth so necessarily require the name of the Author, that if he be not of credite and authoritie of knowen conscience and integritie, yea of mo such also then of one or two, and if it haue not bysides good proofe and testimonie: without al these, I saie,To saie il of any, requireth good authoritie. such infamous Libels, that come to destroy, & not to edifie the honour and good name of any person of account before due and orderly conuiction, ought with no honest man to haue any credite at al: but ought to be taken as a railing report of a rascal Parasite, a soother of affections, and a seruer of appetites for flatterie or gaine.
               On the other side,The Answerers general intention. I come (as thou seest) not to destroy, but to vpholde the fame I find the persons in possession of: not to alter or diminish any good opinion conceiued, but with continuance and increase of al mutual wel liking eche of other, to preuent the change and decay thereof, til ordinarie meane and iudicial proceeding shal giue warrant therefore. I come to saie somewhat for them,

that are not permitted to saie ought for themselues. I take not on me to answer in al partes for them, nor would not be taken, as to saie al for them, that they can saie for themselues (for so should I, I know, rather hinder, then helpe them) but I only lay a parte of that before you, that euery Christian conscience and good natured man, that any witte hath, ought and is bound to suppose and beleeue of them, til they see other matter and better proued, then this pield Pamphlet bringeth foorth any.
               I come not to accuse any person by name that is in disgrace, as this Author doth: I tel you no strange nor hidden things, as he professeth. That, which I laie and alleage, resteth not in deuises, in intentions and meanings onely, as al the accusations of this Author doth: but I laie foorth open knowen factes, and manifest dedes knowen to al men, without the blame of any person by name now in estate to take harme thereby. Neither speake I in the person of any one or few,Why the Author is not named. and therefore by putting a priuate name to the publique speache and

opinion of al good men, I should preiudice both the parties and the cause.
               Finally, I speake without name vnto you now, bycause with name you may not now be spoken vnto: and I forbeare my name at this time, to the end I may by name speake againe an other time (as if cause so require, I meane to do historically) knowing by experience long syns, lately, and often proued: that if by name I shoulde encounter with this namelesse man, neither should I be permitted to speake, nor you suffered to heare me.
               And now let vs turne to examine a 
                     •
                  itle, in what maner this man taketh in 
                     •
                  and to satisfie the good, and to stop the 
                     •
                  outhes of the euil: which he alleageth 
                     •
                  o be the whole cause of his writing.
               First, he graunteth, that the better  sorte of menne are not satisfied with the imprisonment of these noble persons, for els pardie his seeking to satisfie them were plainely superfluous.The Libel confesseth
                        •
                      that good men be not satisfied wt these doings And how doth this commend the cause, that honest men generally do mislike therewith by his owne confession?
               
                  
                   Then he commeth forth with an vnnecessary and vnwonted forme of diuulging such matters vnto the people. For al men knowe, that neither hath it bene thought nedeful, nor in time past vsed (for satisfaction of the multitude) in suche open assemblies, nor by prin
                     •
                  ed Libels to make such declarations, nor to publish such accusatiōs of any men, whose crimes were manifest, when the matter would beare it selfe, nor when the proceding intended was iustifiable by Law, meant to be equally ministred.
               
                   And comming to satisfie the one, and to close the mouthes of the other:The absurditie of the Libel. the tale is told, neither of them both wotteth by whome, & the matter is straunge and vnknowen, as himselfe alleageth it, and yet commeth out to mooue them (as you see) to change their opinion, and to alter their affections: to hate whome they loued, and to condemne whome they honoured.
               
                   His matter alleaged, is for the chief pointes, of purpose confusely laied forth, obscurely penned, without pro
                     •
                  f or testimonie, without certaintie i
                     •
                   it self, al

in general termes, and al without those particularities and circumstances, that are necessarily requisite, to induce any credite. And this is the waie that this man hath taken, to open truth, to satisfie the good, & to stoppe the mouthes of the euil disposed. And what place or effect can this take (trowe you) with any of both?
               If therfore any plaine man of meane vnderstāding may euidently see, that this waie he walketh, is so farte from the purpose that he pretendeth to bend it vnto, that it shal confirme, and not confute the lewd sorte in their lewd opinions, and leaue the good lesse satisfied, then they were before: then must it needes be, that this lewd Author either wittingly deceiueth vs, or sottishly is deceiued by others: in taking (I meane) good for euil, and euil for good: in calling truth, falsehood: and falsehood, truth: and in accounting the good sort for slaunderous and seditions, and the seditious in deede, for honest and vertuous.
               Now where he telleth you, that it is likely, that false and slaunderous reportes

wil be made of this matter, to serue the appetites of the 
                     •
                  uil disposed: you must be warie, that you missetake not his meaning,The ho

               Now what cause he hath to feare, least these Prisoners thus disgraced and defamed should be better reported of, than their desertes require: let thine owne memorie and experience (Reader) if thou be of mature yeares, be iudge, & tel thee. Remember, what thou hast knowen to hau

               And if this Author yet, or any man for him wil wrangle with me, and to extenuate his fault, wil pleade the reuerend opinion that men ought to haue of the doings of Authoritie, & excuse him for thinking and speaking ill of them, whome Authoritie apprehendeth and cōmitteth: and would likewise accuse me as an impugner of the Magistrates, and a defender of the faultie against common Authoritie: I answeare, that for so farre foorth as common order and publique Authoritie haue autentikely notified to the vulgare sorte, the inferiours ought to haue a reuerend opinion therof, and to deeme the best that knowen matter wil permit.
               But being often and commonly seene, that sometimes vpon suspicion, somtimes vpon false accusation, common Authoritie hath bene moued by restraint of personal libertie, to cal sundrie persons to answere

matters supposed against them, whome they haue after with honour to both, dismissed and set free againe: shal it not now be lauful for me to preserue, as I can, the honour and same of those Noble Princes, not yet blemmished by any cōmon, order or Law, against a namelesse baggage fellow, that for flatterie or briberie runneth before the Magistrates, accusing, belying, and defaming them, whome no orderly sentence hath touched nor condemned?

Who goeth to so many of a Princes Coūsel, & laboureth them, to procure y• Princes fauor, in a a cause that he would haue hidden from the Prince?
               Adde vnto this the impossibilitie, that the Duke must nedes see of compassing this mariage without your Q. cōsent who held the other partie in close prison: &

ioine vnto it his assured foresight to haue thereby neither benefit, nor aduancemēt, without hauing your Q. fauor before it, and succor after it, but plainly the contrary, assured of all displeasure and daunger of life, landes, and goodes.

               For in cases of lesse weight, then these are, that touche Princes, Crounes, and Realmes, his wisedome must know, that the naked affirmation of Master R. G.

for proued, graunted or concluded: much lesse in a case of this importance, can any man be induced to thinke, that a Prince of her knowen wisedome, modestie, and gracious nature, hath committed so many, so rash, so vndiscrete, & so violēt errours, as might haue bene attempted by force, and assayed by arte.

Titles (to wit, as daughter to her Father, as sister to her brother, as successor to her sister, established by th

               For when no man hath at any time shewed him selfe by worde, by writing,

nor by facte, to impugne nor interrupt your Q. quiet enioying her state and dignitie, nor hath looked for any such recognitiō or acknowleging, as this Author now beginneth to make men enquire of: this rehersall is plainly frutelesse and needelesse, or rather doth harme, than any good, to the vniuersall opinion of men touching your Q. interest vnto that Croune, and persuadeth nothing, but a likelyhood, yt your selues do either mistrust some padde in the strawe, touching that matter: or for malice to ye Q. of Scot. haue put into your Q. head some more doubt of her owne Title, then either the Q. of Scotl. or any other haue moued, or appeared to thinke on.
            
            
               7. It is also knowen (saieth he) that she hath not perfourmed her promise, but with friuolous answers hath delaied it. Neither is it of any force to be demanded, nor woorth the hauing, if she would yeelde to performe it. For that, she that could not neither gette this realme &c. nor keepe her owne, &c. can not amende your Q estate, &c. nor yet is her promise in any thing to be holden fyrme or durable. &c.
               
                  IN this the Author graunteth yet,And chargeth the Q. of Eng. that the Q. of Scotl. hath offered and promised to doe ynowgh, and all yt lieth in her, for the assurance of your Q. quiet possession. And this (no doubt) is verie trew, sauing that the condition is not here expressed, which was alwaies annexed vnto the promise: that is to saie, so that she might be declared by Parliament to be the next Heire and Successor to your Q. dying without laufull yssue of her owne body. And in this the Author seeth not, how he chargeth and burdeneth your Q. both with iniury and ingratitude, by stil oppressing her, that hath offered so much.
               Yea but she hath not performed it (sayeth he) but differreth it with friuolous answers, &c.The Q. of Scotl. readines to assure the Q. of England. 
                  Cuius contrarium verum est. For of this muche I take on me (who account my selfe as credible, as this Author of mine owne knowledge to assure you, as hauing bene in some sorte a party intreating those affaiers, yt for the securitie of your Q. quiet enioying her present Dominions, the Q. of Scotl. euer

And the friuolous answers and delaies you speake of haue bene altogether made and vsed by your Q. who by force of reason (being pressed often both by the Q. of Scotl. her selfe, and by the letters and Embassadors of all other Princes) hath bene cōstrained to graunt and promise the reformation and abe

For and if you could haue shewed any, who seeth not, but that here had bene your time & place to vtter it, and that you want no malice

to do it? Of which example and irritatiō of yours if I should make my paterne, and follow you (where not your frontes more then meretriciae) I should make you blush, as bolde faced as you be.

It is said (saith he) and credibly auowed. that the Q. of Scotl. was the greatest cause of the rebellion lately in the North: wherby some honorable houses &c. by her cunning practise were inticed to ouerthrowe them selues and their families with a multitude of mo English subiects, then she could haue done by armes in the field, if she had bene in possession of her kingdome.

of the ambitious, that suttelly by litle and litle & in length of time do worke and compasse their aspiring purposes: euen so in few or no places it chaunceth, but that some sooner, and some later, do fall into the reckening thereof, and as by processe of time & outward factes the matter groweth riper, so doth the greater number come to discouer and espie it.

If it had, I meane, the conditiō annexed, that the Q. and the Duke did alwaies expresse: that is to saie, that without your Q. fauor & good consent,The marriage neuer intēded without the Q. consent. as they had not before euer intēded it, they would not hereafter procede further in it.
               And not vnlike is it, that the Q. of Scotl. might answere in sense & effect, as he hath alleaged: yt is to wit, that she neither first moued it, nor at first liked it. For a rare matter is it, to finde a right meane womā to be ye first mo

And euen so may euery man see, yt any wit hath, that without ye fauour of your Q. first obteined, ye other of Scotl. had litle reason or cause, to think y• match any way beneficiall vnto her, regarding specially the state she stoode & stands in.

assurance of your Q. consent therevnto: if not by her owne mouth, yet by them, that (for their credit with her) all men knewe were able easely to persuade and obteine it, if they had as faithfully gone about it, as they did fraudulētly promise it. Nay, this I say further, that if he had not bene first inuited to thinke of it, and daily animated, & encouraged for a long time together to procede in it,Synon circumuented

               This obiection therefore expressing their promises of renuntiatiō doth more burden and charge your Q. then any of them both. For being trew that they promised so firmely by handes and seales, by mouthes and writinges,The Q. and Duke iniu

                   And in the meane time, it must be taken thus, y• all this fault imputed vnto them, resteth in this: that by secret messages or letters they haue had mutuall conference and intelligēce touching a laufull mariage betweene thēselues. And is not this a sore matter, and a greiuous crime?
               Yea, but they vvere prisoners (he sayth) and vvithout your Q. cōsent, and against their ovvne promis

                      they treated it, &c. I answere, that none of all these be iust impedimentes to prohibite laufull matrimonie, neither by practise, nor booke lawe. But contrarily, exāples many both of old & late yeres may be brought foorth, manifestly prouing, that neither ye restraint of ye body by personal imprisonmēt, nor ye wāt of ye Princes cōsent, nor any promise of ye parties,

by message or letter (grounded only vpō feare of displeasure or temporall paine) are any sufficient impediments to stay a laufull mariage.
               And here this Author endeth his rehersall of thinges knowen and certeinly found, as he termeth them, which beeing all so weakely proued, so vnlikely of themselues, and so manifestly disproued by common reason and knowen factes, as ye haue heard: what may now be looked for in the reast, which he rehearseth but vpon coniectures and reportes, or rather as thinges not yet fully reported nor coniectured, but as thinges yt might be saied, and maie be said, and hereafter (bylike) shalbe said, to be knowen things also.
            
            
               12. But now appeareth it (saith he) how daungerous the intention of that mariage is to your Q. by other daungerous practises that haue accompained and followed this attempt (if you wil beleue him) which almighty God hath merueilously discouered, to the preseruation, both of your Q. person, and the Realme. &c.
               
                  THis obiection threateneth some fearefull bugge at hande, whiche bylike we shal see anon. But whether this matche were like to be dangerous to your Q. and Realme (as he concludeth it to be) or no, I minde not here to dispute long: specially sins the same is already by a namelesse Discourser so grauely discoursed, on both sides argued, and for the profoundnes of it published in print, this somer past: which (seeming to conclude, that it were more safety to your Q. and Realme, that ye Q. of Scotl

                   maried with a foraine Prince, rather then with a subiect of England) doth yet chiefely rest & relie vpon this, yt she is to marry, or not to marry, as your Q. will, or will not, and when, & whome so euer she shal appoint. For shee remayning in your Q gouernment,A folish argum

                     . y• contrary disputation (sayth he) is as much, as to aske, whether your Q. maie gouerne in her owne Realme, or not.
               Now let vs (good Reader) turne our speach for a word or two from this Hobgoblin, vnto that namelesse Discourser, the force of whose argument being

grounded vpon the Queene of Scotl. being in your Q. gouernment, lette vs aske him this question: to wit, whether the same reason doth hold, or no, in euery other person that is in your Q. gouernment, as well as in the person of the Q. of Scotl? If he saie no, I shall be glad to heare his reason, why? and to vnderstande the difference that he will make betweene the condition of her person, and theirs: and why she should be more in that subiection, then all the reste.
               If he answer, for her proximitie in bloud vnto your Q. and for her Title to y• Croune of England: I answere, that there is neither lawe, nor statute, priuate of that Realme (now in force, as I take it) nor publike in the world, I am sure, that restraineth the liberty of matrimony, more in a Prince, then in a poore mā. And so consequently no colour of law to giue to your Q. any such Iurisdiction ouer the person of the Q. of Scotland.
               But supposing your Discourser foreseeing, that he should haue little thanke to make that answer (at their hands, I meane, that chiefely manage your Q.

                   Croune no Title at all) will flee therfore to the other refuge, and answer, that your Q. being sole and supreme gouerner in her owne Realme, of al persons & affaires whatsoeuer, hath therfore the disposition and gouernance of al persons in her Dominions, as well in their mariages, as in all other thinges (for otherwise I see not, but that it would be somewhat absurde, to say, that she should haue more Iurisdiction in the person of the Q. of Scotland (who is an absolute Prince of a for

                  ine Dominion, not borne vnder her subiection, nor otherwise present in her Dominion, but by violence deteined against her will) then she hath in the persons of her owne borne subiects): & then if he rest vpon that supreme authority of your Q. to be preeminēt ouer ye persons and mariages of all her borne subiects, by cause they be vnder her gouernance: I see not then, that this discourser maketh any difference betweene the mariages of Christian creatures, and the brutish coupling of vnreasonable beasts.

Whereby you may see, that they, that set both that Author, and this a worke, woulde faine haue it taken, that the securitie of your Q. and Realme, consisted in the maintenance of that licentiouse doctrine, which hath in shorte time confounded

al Princes and places, that euer yet receaued it.
               In deede euident it is, that that matche strongly impugned the secret and finall purpose of those two English Machiauelles, who for their owne aduancement, intende to wreste the succession of the Crowne to a wrong family. But how it coulde possibly haue indangered either your Q. or Realme, neither doth this Author shew, or that Discourser proue, nor by any common intendemente can be presumed. And by the way notable it is, that a thing so manifestly beneficiall to your Queene and common Wealth, shoulde be accompted offensiue, and published to be daungerouse to your Prince, for impugning only the priuate preference of two suche persons.

vnhable to moue any man that wit or reason hath: I may rather thinke it to muche, that I haue thus farre aparted my speache from my principall purpose, then yelde to be drawen to folow his folie any further, specially sins this pamphelet now beareth vs in hand, that we shal see such dang

The Citie should haue bene taken by force, foraine Souldiours in great numbers should haue come out of the Lowe Countreis by Sea vnto a notable Port of the Realme. So should Rebelles and foraine enemies haue ioyned and proceded to further things not expedient yet to be spoken of. &c.

And in a matter so dangerous both to the senders and carriers, who doth vse to make superfluous writings, and to send mo letters then be necessary? This therefore sufficing to shewe euery wise man a plaine probabilitie, that al is forged aud feined: let vs yet examine a litle, what is in this accusation, if it were as he sayeth.
               
                  The Q. of Scotl. hath reason to seeke laufull helpe.For the Q. parte first, I meane, if she gaue letters of credit to a Messenger, that went to the Pope and King of Spaine: what offence had it bene, or to whome? Who se

                  th not, what greate reason she hath
                     •
                   to seeke to them both? Her imprisonment can not take from her yt, which

nature hath geuen her. She remaineth a Queene by Birth and Right, and by Nature shee is bound to seeke the libertie of her person, and restitution to her owne. And what iust Prince, or good common Weale can impute that for a crime, that all lawes of Nature and Nations doe moue all men vnto?
               If therefore there were any suche Messenger, and any such letters of credit: euery honest man ought and is bound, to presume (till the contrary be proued) that the credit was for the most likest and laufull cause: to wit, by laufull meanes and mediation of forreine frindes, to come to that, that Nature and al Lawes gaue her, which by any meanes at home she could not obteine. And now let vs resorte a litle to examine the likelyhood and probabilitie,The D. of Norf. wrote to neither of bothe. whether the Duke gaue any such letters of credit to any suche messenger.

Thus much touching the letters of credit, that these Authors doe surmise were sent to the Pope and King of Spaine.

accusation maketh no particular mentiō, what was in the Q. letter, nor in any of theirs, whome he calleth others, but a sentence or two of the letter written (if the Author say true) to the Duke only, and that from the Pope only. For, as frō the king of Spaine, he speaketh not of any at all. And that which he telleth you of the Popes wordes to the Duke,The accusation conuinc

               For (sayth he) the Pope allovved vvell of the enterprise. was that, trowe you, an enterprise of rebellion? was that the enterprise of sacking London by strangers? If the Pope could be thought to thinke it, yet being wise, and hauing counsell, it is not like, he would write it. If he would needs write it, yet he would not choose to write it first to the Duke of Northfolke, a stranger to him, &

a knowen Protestant from his educatiō.
               Well, the Pope vvould vvrite (sayth he) to the king of Spaine to further it. Iudge thou Reader, whether that be like or not, that his Holines esteemeth his owne credit so litle with the greatest King in Christendome, that he would require him to further a rebellion, and to sacke a Citie of suche force, wealth, and renowne, them selues both being knowen to haue cōsumed both their money and men in the repressing of the sundry rebellions, yt haue bene moued vnder your Q. name & authority by ye very Authors of these Libels.

               First, the Libels are many that are put out to defame them.

For euery man perceiueth, that the chief purpose of these Libelles be, to discredite those Noble persons with the people, and to bring them into hatred and obloquie of the multitude. Which fourme of proceeding is knowen to euery man of experience, or con

               THis lye, good Reader, is not much vnlike vnto the last, sauing that of the other, he seemed hable to feine some colour and pretense, whereby to couer yet a litle his falsehood and malice: but of this the honest man is able to deuise none at al. And although he would craftily dissemble, & passe ouer the name of him, by whome he meaneth Ireland should be assailed

               And behold the impudencie of these men, that, albe it they did this Sommer last past obiect the same to the King him self by expresse letters, and were foorthwith so answered thervnto, that they had

               And it is worth the noting, how oft they roue in this maner at the King of Spaine, sometime vnder the name of the Duke of Alua, of the Low Countries, of foreine forces, and by such other speaches, as euery man may see, whom they meane, and yet this crafty child thinketh it policie, to hide & forbeare his name, as wel for that he wanteth that couer to cloke his lye withal towards the King if he should haue named him) that he found out for the Pope (for no man would haue beleued the excuse of want of money to haue bene pleaded by the King of Spaine) as also bycause he would haue a shifting and starting hole, ready to replie (with saying that he meant not the King) against any plai

                     ety (saith Synon) is treason to England.I shal therfore for ye answer of this Paragraph, only praie thee to looke a litle into ye mind & meaning of y• Authors therof, & to tel me, what it cōprehendeth & implieth, yt an intentiō of remouing ye person of the Prince of Scotland into Spaine (if any such intent were) should be heere accounted & brought in among ye deuises of treason to Englād, & of mouing troubles vnto that Realme. If thou consider this point deepely, thou shalt smel and find out the stinking ratte, that lyeth yet hidden

betweene the benche and the wall. For, litle difference or none is there (if it be truely sifted) whether Spaine or France had the person of that Prince: vnlesse it be this, that through the great factions and ciuil seditions of the one, there may be some more hope of finding one meane or other, to destroy him in France, rather then in Spaine.
               And he that remembreth the warres of Leeth in the yeare 1560. with the causes therof then pretēded & published in print, must plainly conclude, that they that now would beare you in hand, that the intentiō of sending the Prince of Scotland into Spaine, were in effect treason, & tēding to y• trouble of England, must nedes meane, the sending of him into Frāce, to be much more preiudicial, & more clearely to tend to the motiō of troubles in your Realme: the Princes & Coūtries of Spaine being knowen to be ye old Allies vnto ye Croune of England, & contrarily ye other accoūted ye auncient enemies of ye same. The treason therefore & troubles meane by these Authors to be threatened to Englād, by th

reast and consist in remouing the person of that yong Prince vnto the Countrey or custodie of any King, that is like and able to saue and defend him. For, to remoue him into England hath ben pardie euen by these Authors chiefly so long sought, so many waies practised, so violētly vrged & pressed: yt euery man may see, the traueilers therof would haue that taken neither for treason, nor tro

               But the mischieuous machination and final end thereof, neither by your Queene (as I suppose) nor by few others is yet knowen, sauoured, nor suspected. But plaine it is, that if the meaning thereof were for his securitie or aduanncement: this intention of sending him into Spaine (if euer it had ben thought) could not haue ben so offensiue to these men, as here (by betraying thēselues vnawares) they haue cōfessed it to be. For how can it possibly be thought, that the safety of the person and the aduancement of the state of that Infant, that is ye borne Heire to any Croune, can be treason, or tēding to moue troubles to that Realme, which himself shal in succession enioy?
               
                  And they that haue already procured the murder of his father, the expulsion of his mother out of her Kingdome, ye putting of his bastard Uncle in possession of the same, ye imprisonment of his mothers Roiall person for v. years almost fully complete, the persecution vnto death of all those that pitie her state, or wishe it better: and finally, that thus by open corruption of accusers, by subornation of false witnesses, by infinite numbers of namelesse Libells printed, do still follow and persecute both her Honour & fame, & (as they maie) disgrace her Rightes, & disprooue her Titles to al her States, with so many colourlesse lyes, false s

                  if it had bene meant) to put his person for safetie out of that Countrey, (where so many ciuil seditions and mutuall murders for many years haue bene, and yet are dayly committed, raised and renewed) into the hands of that King,

that is best hable to defende him, that is the olde confederate of the chiefest States which he is borne to inherite, and that hath choice of daughters, for yeares and otherwise meete, to matche with him: can this (I say) be thought by any man that any wit hath, to be meant by these fellowes for the Princes safetie and securitie? Nay, but by this you may plainly see, that the Authors of these Libelles haue a farre other marke and

               19. And now it may be, that some will say, that many of these thinges are doubtfull, and percase wrested in reporte, either by malice, or by ouermuch credulitie. But truely in such credible sorte are all the thinges aboue mentioned with sundry others to me reported to be verie true, by such as haue cause to knowe them, and vse not to report vntruthes, as I do boldly auow them to be true.

For albe it, he hath hitherto taken vpon him, flatly & firmely to affirme, al y• chiefe & principall matters to be true & knowen truthes, as he termeth them: yet now here he commeth out, & calleth al the matters a

               WHen this Author wrote this, either he thought, that none should come to see his boke, yt by reading or practise had any vnderstanding in worldly policie: or els, to blinde & abuse the simpler sorte (which ar

               For, by his owne words not six lines before, if you haue marked them, it is probably gathered, and by his other words within twentie lines following, manifestly prooued: that of ye Counsel they be, of whome this man hath receiued his informations, & instructiōs, if not immediatè at their owne mouthes, yet by suche meanes as he is assured, yt the matter cometh from some of yt authoritie.Some of the Councel be the ch

               And ouer this, marke well, good Reader, how God hath permitted the Author of this Libell in these woords (vnwares
                     •
                   I dare say) to shew him selfe either so foolish, that no wise man ought to beleeue him, or so false, that no honest man can credit him in none of all these matters heretofore reported by him. Remembring therfore, yt in the ninetenth Article he tolde you, that all these matters came to him so credibly reported &c. and speaking still of all, here he telleth you, that he hath not fully ynough reported them: in this, I say, marke you well, what he confesseth against him selfe.
               If he haue not fully ynough reported the matters, that he hath spoken of: it must be graunted, yt his reports of them do want some part requisite for a report, either in respect of ye thing reported, or in regarde of them, to whome the reporte is made.

If the defect therefore be in respect of the persons, to whome he writeth: that is to saie, that his reportes are in such manner laid foorth, as are not fully ynough to make his Readers perceiue his meaning: then you see his grosse folie and lacke of witte, to vtter his mind fully ynough.
               If it be (as al mens writings are) fully ynough for some, but not fully ynough for al: then you see his grosser folie, that calleth this not fully ynough, whiche is fully ynough, as commonly any mannes writings are. For neuer man wrote so fully, ye wotte, as coulde satisfie euery man. If the defect be (as I plainly conclude it is, and you haue seene proued) in the nature of the thing it selfe: that is to saie, that his reportes doe lacke those necessary parts, that a report ought to haue, as truth & certaintie of ye matter reported, and a good warrant & foundation for y• reporter to speake vpō: then may you see his fals
                     •
                  hod & malice more then fully ynough.
               Once graunted it is by himselfe, that fully ynough they are not reported: and a reporte neuer so brief, conteining truth, matter certeine, and hauing a lauful Author,

is sufficient ynough for the common number of wise and honest men. For no man is bound further to enlarge his report, then truth & certaintie doth require, nor to satisfie euery man.
               These wordes of his owne then, you see, do plainly conuince and conclude, that either these reports be al false, vncertaine, and ill grounded in more or in lesse, (and than plaieth he the very Dauie, to thinke and saie heere, that they are not yet fully ynough reported, which you haue seene proued to be to much by altogether) or els the very Sot, to cal that not fully ynough reported, that is fully ynough for the purpose it is vttered for and euery way more than fully ynough, beeing false in euery parte.
            
            
               Synce I wrote this, I am the more emboldened to thinke al these things true, for that this present day the Lord Maior of the Citie of London with a number of his Brethren were at the Starchāber with the Q. Maiesties Councel: where I vnderstood by the reporte of some of them, that heard what was said by the Councel to them concerning the present

case of the Duke of Norf. that the substance of al, that is by me before reported, is very true, with muche more, &c.
               THis Author hauing now eased somwhat his loden stomake towardes these Princes, by vttering of these vnsauerie and filthy forged lyes to their infamie & confusion (as he hopeth) is come at length to the end & conclusion of his spiteful poysoned Pamphlet, for whose credit he leaueth no way vnassaied.
               For hauing vttered those argumentes and reasons, that he hoped might induce the multitude to beleue him: yet his owne guiltie conscience doth put him in feare (you see) least his falsehood should be to easy to be discouered, & therefore he fleeth now at last (as you may perceiue) & craueth refuge of the wing of Authoritie.

               I conclude therefore, that these Starchamber talkes, and Yeldhal orations, do so litle aduance the credit of those slaunderous lies: that to euery wise man (that considereth by the Stories, what haue ben the sequeles of suche vnwonted actions) they manifestly conuince them to be forged and feined: and do bring withal pregnant suspicion, of a further desperate intention, to be hidden and couered therein.

a Tragedie, will not take a foile in their owne imagination, whose blood so euer it cost therefore.
               The number of the prisoners, you knowe, is great: and therefore great difference of natures like to be found among them, some weaker then others, and one subiect to that, whereof an other is free. Authority carieth in her hand (as it were) all hope and feare,There are many waies of corrupt proceeding. all paine and reward. Such as can not be wonne by feare nor paine, may yet be seduced by flattery or gaine. Torments haue bene tried, as the voice goeth: and subornations shall not want, as hath bene well prooued. False arts and treachery to deceiue the simple and plaine, haue bene so frequently practised with persons of lesse importance, yt among these no man can looke for lesse.
               Harde it were therefore, if among so great a number none should be founde, y• by paine or feare, by hope or by fauour, by flattery or simplicitie, haue bene seduced, allured, nor constrained to say this or that, of him selfe or of others. The malice borne towards them is euident, y• crimes obiected against them, obscure and not

likely. I haue good reason therefore, to speake in their defense, whiles nothing is passed, yt cōuinceth them: nor nothing proued, yt bindeth me to thinke them guiltie.
               It is possible, that hereafter some of them may be cōdemned in forme of Law. For where such arts haue bene vsed to sclaunder and intrap them, no lesse can be looked for. And yet yt ought not in reason to minish the credit of that I haue said, hauing hitherto said no further for them, then as mine Aduersaries false accusatiōs in defense of the trueth hitherto knowen, haue moued and drawen me. Which consisting in hearsaies, reports, and in yt bare words of an unknowen Author: I haue answered with facts, with reasons and probable consequences, that giue to them selues more credit & authority, then any mannes name yt could be put vnto them.
               And if the Duke shall fortune hereafter vpon any other matter here not touched, or vpon the same inforced aboue the iust desert (as sometime it happeneth) or through the suttle practise and malice of his enemies (as to his Noble Father and Grandfather it chanced) to be by verdict

or Parliament found otherwise, then I heere defend him to be: acknowledge thou, the true ground and cause thereof to be (as in deede it is) the mercifull hand and visitation of God, now laid vppon him, as than it was vpon them: not for the causes pretended against the one, nor the other (in the sight of God, that seeth all truth) not for the breache, I meane, of their allegeances against their seuerall Soueraignes (to whome in all loialty & affection, neuer were they, nor this found inferiour to any) but rather cōtrarily for their ouermuch adoring of the same, for making their earthly Princes their Gods in this world.

against the chief of her Sisters Counsel, and therby obteined fauour: and finding that he had a yong Ladie in hand, that was vnexpert in matters of State, of a deepe wit, and timorous nature, and thereby easily made suspicious, sone circumuented by them that could cunningly abuse her, conformable to them that shee trusted, and that promised, with securitie, her ease and disburdening of the care of her weighty affaires: he induced foorthwith, a confederate of his owne (by birth more base then himselfe, neerly yet allied vnto him, & in heresie more feruent then he) into such credit and confidence at first, that foorthwith was remooued the most vpright Prelate and incorrupt Iudge of Europe, to aduance this second Synon, the most knowen Briber of al the Isle of Britanie, to giue him the chief place and Dignitie of that Realme vnder herself.

                In that went necessarily included yt separation of her selfe from the Unitie and amitie of the Sea Apostolike, and y• making of the same a new enemy, which allwaies had bene an old frind to her State and Croune: who being a State absolute that can neuer die, nor leaue his Heire an infant, and being of such account with all

Princes that professe Christes name, that who so hateth most his office, is yet glad of his frindship: the rash renouncing o
                  •
                the amitie thereof, may more importe her, then all the English Sect of Synon can profit or auaile her.
            In that went away the ministery and  seruice of all the Bishops and principall Clergy of her Realme, & of infinite numbers of the grauest also of the lay Nobilitie. of whose seruice she depriued her selfe, by presuming to yt spiritual Preeminence, in which such as were carefull of conscience, and fearfull to offende, would beare no function, but with any temporal losse, did chuse to yeld their ministery in ye cōmon Wealth to them yt would take it.

By yt a cōtention & pike was put betwene y• two obediēces, yt euery of her Catholike subiects oweth: ye one to God, ye other to her: whiles those two Authorities did so seuerely exact, 
                  〈◊〉

               eruent affectiō that the Catholikes had towardes her, who were then the strongest, and her most assured partie.
            
                In that, & not til then, went away the hope of the recouerie of Calice, whiche til then could not be said to be lost, bycause ye warres remained open as well for it, as for the reast: which was a more necessary ornament for that Croune, then these Catili

               , Spaine, Frāce, Flanders, & Scotlād, yea & of Germanie too, in such forme as it was: wherby she (whose Progenitors w
                  •
               re wont by one line to draw with the other Princes their Peers, their equals, & confederates) hath now aparted herselfe from them al, draweth by a nother, yea by a contrary line against them al. Shee receiueth,

that they reiect: she planteth, that they grubbe vppe: she mainteineth, that they represse: and contemneth, that they adore. And how can this possibly s
                  •
               ande and cō
               curre with that harty amity, that assureth Princes in their States? Or can it be denied, that euery Prince is not yt strōger, for the faithfull frindship of his Cōfederats? Or were her Progenitors forced (for their owne safety) to seeke those foule shifts, that haue in her name and behalfe bene sought out, in euery Countrey about her? The practises vsed to vpholde thenterprise hitherto, do make plaine demonstratiō of short continuance of such amitie.
            In that, was also conteined a generall  change of the whole face of her common Weale: the discrediting, the abasement, and the impouerishing of all, in more or lesse, whom she found established in credit, Authority, & Gouernance: and likewise the aduancement of the inferior and base sorte to Dominion and rule.
            In that, went comprehended, her  great infamy, and dishonor: as by all foreine Nations presently, and by all perpetuall

Histories at home & abrode (more for these mens fault, then for her owne) to be accompted, called, written, and recorded by those odiouse termes, and repro
                  •
               heful Epithets, that persons cōdemned for Heresie & Schisme haue ben wont to heare: And with the skorneful nicknames of a Shee-headde, a Breetchelesse Head, and a domme Head of the Church by S. Poules prescription: to y• manifest diminution of that Reuerende estimatiō, that is dewe to her, by Parentage, as a Kings daughter: by Dignitie, as a Q. and by profession, as a Christian.
            In that was the seede sowen, and y• foundation laied, whervpon ineuitably must ensew her Excommunication, if she persisted. The weight of which yoke I leaue to be considered by the Histories and Presidents of times past, yea and by their owne startling, storming, & raging therat, that seeme vnto her most to contemne, and to make least of it.
            
                In that, went included her violent vnion with her two Machia
                  •
               ellians: to whome from thence foorth by plaine 
                  •
               orce and constraint she was coupled and

tied, to cleaue and leane to them, for better, for worse: and might no more without preiudice departe from them after, than he that leauing the dry land, sitteth in the water vpon an other mans backe, maie leaue him that carrieth him, without weeting his skinne. Which practise is more perilous to a Prince (if it be deepely considered) than at the first face it appeareth.
            In this, was necessarily comprehended  the creation of a new Crew, and the setting vppe of a Partie Protestant, not appearing before: who being come to the height of their pride, obey her no more now, then they do the Pope, nor no more esteme her cōmandements, then his Canons, in what so euer her pleasure impugneth theirs: but wil haue their owne waies, by force or by arte, in short time, be the same neuer so diuers, variable, & contrarious. Whereof let the exaction of the Othe, and the infinite vexations of her subiects for religiō: yea, let the Crosse in her owne Chappell, the lights on the table there, the decēt attire of Ministers,

the Surplisses in their Synagogs, their feelde preachings, their secrete lectures, and the infinite differences of Sects, of seruises, and formes of Religion vsed in corners, & knowen to all men, giue triall and testimonie.
            
                And in the setting vp of that partie, goeth plainly included the derogatiō and danger (if not the subuersion, and ouerthrowe) of all Nobilitie, yea of the chiefe Monarkes & Princes themselues. Wherof Flanders and France, Scotland and England are already witnesses to euery man that hath any wit or discourse. For the substance and effecte, which you see already 
                  •
               ully wrought in Scotlād, & almost halfendell in France by plaine violence and force: the same you see by arte compassed in England, and hath ben by both so proudly assaied, that it lacked not much to ha

kepe the names and shew, God knoweth how litle while some of them shall.
            In that goeth also conteined suche  a corruption of her people at home, as in shorte time threateneth plaine inci

               ilitie and barbarous manners: wherof both y• Histories, and present estates of Afrike, Greece, Boheme, and Hungary do giue manifest proofe. And Germany also (for the small time that is ronne, sins it fell thervnto) doth witnesse the same notoriously: to all them, I meane, y• did know that Countrey and people before their defection, and haue bene conuersant with them since, of whome there are yet great numbers li

that they seeme to find, as it were, a new Land, a new Nation, new Lawes, new customes, and manners, & plainly a new face and aspect of the people.
            Yea, goe yet a litle nearer, and if thou be indifferent, I wil demaund none other Iudge but thy selfe, of the difference, that thou findest betwene the modest maners of them, that are yet suche Catholikes among you, as the time and place wil permit, and the vnbridled light conditions of the professed Protestantes generally: betwene the fideli

               ie of the one, and the vnfaithfulnes of the other: betweene the sinceritie of the one, and the craft of the other: and betweene the brideled feare of conscience in the one, and the insolent impudencie of y• other. The notorious oddes wherof in so short time do make manifest demonstration, whervnto it tendeth and must come, in the reuolution of a few yeares mo.
            
                Finally in this was conteined a kinde of exchāge or barter, as they cal it: wherin renouncing to confide vppon the assured fidelitie of her learned Clergie, of her aunciēt Nobilitie, & of her Catholike partie at

home (that in al things obeyed her without exception) shee accepted for the same the painted promises of her vpstart Protestantes, that obeyed her no longer, then til their Partie were of strength.
            And for the foreine and auncient entier amitie, that she had with y• Sea Apostolike, with the Emperour, and with al the Princes of Italie, Spaine, France, Flanders and Scotland, she accepted the amitie of a Condie, an Orange, a Lodowike, a Murrey, a Murton, and a French Admiral: that haue hitherto let fal by the waie, al that euer leaned and reasted vppon them.
            These now being the profites and frutes that your Queene and Countrey haue reaped and gathered of this Tree of mutation: let vs see, what other frute it hath yelded to the Deuisers themselues, and to their frindes and faction,The sweet

                   frutes of that tree, for Synon and his mates. that haue bene the drawers of your Queene, to the planting thereof: and whether their owne priuate turnes be thereby no better serued, then hers, nor their owne a

be to friuolous and vaine to abuse any wise man. For they y• vnder King Henry were as Catholike, as the six Articles required: that vnder King Edward were such Protestants, as y• Protectour would haue them: that vnder Q. Marie were Catholikes againe, euen to creeping to the Crosse: and that vnder Q. Elizabeth were first Lutherans, setting vp Parker, Cheiny, Gest, Bill. &c. than Caluinistes, aduauncing Grindall, Iuell, Horne &c. then Puritans, maiteining Sampson, Deering, Humfrey, &c. and now (if no
                  •
                Anabaptists, and Arrians) plaine Macchiauellians: yea, they that persuade in publike speaches,Sinōs table talke treason to God. that man hath free libertie to dissemble his Religion, and for Authoritie do alleage their owne exāples and practise of feining one Religion for an other in Q. Maries time (which conteineth a manifest euacuation of Christes owne comming & doctrine, of y• Apostles preaching & practise, of y• blood of y• Martyrs, of y• constancie of al Confessors: yea and of y• glorious vaine deathes of al the stincking Martyrs of their innumerable Sects of Heretiks, one & other, hauing

alwaies taught, the confession of mouth to be as necessarie to saluatiō, as yt belief
                  •
                of hart): shall these men now be admitted to pleade conscience in religion? And can any man now be coosyned so much, as to thinke, that these men by conscience were than moued to make that mutatiō?
            And, as for the feare of the French, I neede not deteine you, or stand thervpon. For the Discourser of the mariage intended betwene the Duke of Norf. and the Q. of Scotland hath sufficiently (and in that parte truely) satisfied all men, and deliuered vs of all feare of oppression by the French, by allegation of the policies of Burgundy and Spaine: though there were no more to be said vnto it.
            And thus hauing seene, that this mutation of the Religion (made not for conscience, nor for any cause or neede of your Queenes parte) her coosyning Councellors haue gained to them selues and their Faction honour, and Authority, richesse, reuenewes, creditte and strength in the highest degrees euerie waie: and your Queene contrarily nothing but dāmage & dishonour, decay of

Eliz. award at 40. yeres old. among her heretikes now contemned more then euer, and in fine, keeping the name of Quene to herself, circumuented to yeld vnto them the substance and effect of all Kingly Dominion: this being seene, I say, by them that wil acknowledge the sight of that they see, to be al the frutes hitherto hatched of that mutation, and common reason teaching vs withal, to deeme and presume the intention of euery enterprise by the principal effectes that folow vpon it: we must conclude, that purposely they did draw your Q. by suttletie vnto that attempt, that conteineth in it her owne detriment and prei

            And if this muche may be seene in so few (for hard it were to shew you al) of the depe deceits & suttle circumuentions vsed to seduce her, to renounce y• auncient Religion of al her Progenitours, if this

much may be seene by the manifest preiudice proued to be growen to herself therby, if this be to be seene by the peril already appearing to depēd vpō y• Realme for the same, and if this also be sene by the notorious aduancement of y• priuate procurers thereof: what would appeare, trow ye, if the hidden & secrete practises, knowen to none but to herself & to them, might once come to light?

Suffolke by any accident should quaile, and be repelled) to giue the Regall chaire to whome they list, finding, I saie, these two Houses & Lines to stande strongly in their way: we haue now to see and cō

            And if this hath bene cōmon in meane mens cases: how much more dangerous is it, and more assuredly to be looked for in a Princes case, whose Croune can lacke no Competitours, and whose Heire specially is laboured, yea enacted before hād to be doubted of, & vnknowen? For this m

            And to your common Wealth, yt neuer dieth, what can be more odious, more dangerous, and more vnnaturall: then so to disfournish it of a knowen Heire, as to haue no marke of obediēce nor allegeāce left, whervpon the people maie fix their eies? Let the question be proponed, and see whether in the intention of that prouision there can be, by any possibility, any other or lesse presumed: then a plaine meaning and resolutiō, to bring ye Cards to shuffling for the Croune, now, when them selues be strongest, to the ende that he that can winne it, maie weare it. For if the words of that Lawe be marked, it is euident, that the meaning of the Procurers thereof is, to haue (as well after your Q. death, as before) a pretense and colour of law to impeache all Interests

and Titles to the Croune what so euer: to the intent that (fayling of their purpose to place the Croune in their owne Familie) no Title should be so cleare, but that by colour of this lawe, there might be somwhat to saie against it: whereby the triall & iudgement thereof may come to the sworde: now, I saie, when as they account them selues farre the strongest party.

               mon Wealth to die also: & with her death, that the whole Sate of the Kingdome should perish withall?
            Bysides, consider how in this Law. they play the honest men with her in an other point: craftily to make the worlde holde her for infamous, and incontinent.

For, in the prohibition of any Heire to be named, they except only the Issew of her bodie,An. 13. Reg. Eliz. cap. 1. with the terme and additiō of Naturall. Which Terme being in your Statutes and Iudicial writings strange and vnwonted, and in all other languages signifiyng plaine Bastards: & they, now purposely forsaking the accustomed words of your Law in such cases, by changing lawfull, for Naturall: and by leauing the olde vsuall words of lawfull Heire, lawfull Children, or Children lawfully begotten, for the new terme of Naturall Issew, that in all languages signifieth Bastardie: what other can be gathered of this (being spoken of your Queene, that is vnmarried) but yt they would thereby couertly insinuate vnto the worlde, that she hath, or mindeth to haue children Naturall, and not lawfull? And is not this a token both of their smal reuerence, & lesse affection towards her?
            Beleeue not, I say, their gloses and false expositiōs: but let them either shew you those Termes of Natural Issue, to haue bene vsed to signifie in your Law writings, lawfull Children: or els (what so

euer their words shalbe) you plainly see, they haue heerein plaied the very ones, euen with her, whome they pretend so much to adore.
            Well, hauing now brought your Q. to this,Your Q. defences taken from her. that neither by children of her owne body, nor by any Heire knowen they feel
                  •
                any impediment, nor stande in any feare: behold, how now they come neerer vnto her, euen to the plucking of her principall feathers. He that intēdeth to stocke vp a tree by the roote, doth first hewe and dig awaie, what so euer defenses of earth

                stone, or wood doe growe or lie about the stemine.
            A Princes chiefe defence must be granted to consist chiefely in foresight of his perill by wisedome: in force of faithfull frinds to resist it, and in feare of Heires to reuenge it. And now behold, how the principallest of all these are by fine arts and deuises pared and weeded away frō your Queene.
            Was there any man in that Lande for  affection to her, more faithful and diligēt:Sir Nicol
                     •
                  s Throgmorton. for wisedome, more circumspect, forecasting, and of deeper foresight: of counsel,

more inuentiue, or of better consideratiō, then was Syr Nicolas Throgmorton
                  •
                And is not 
                  •
               e finely weeded awaie from her?
            
                Consider, who by nature and affectiō was so neerly tied vnto her,The Duke of Norfolke. who in al her seruices was so zelous and assured, and who with frinds and force was so well hable to defende her, as was the Duke of Norf? And marke you now the arte, by which he is also pared away from her.
            
                What childe, what Cosin, or what Heire had she by blood and law,The Q. of Scotland. so nere vnto her, to succede her, in the worlde, and so ready and hable to reuenge any violence offered her, as was the Queene of Scotland? And beholde, whether she be not also weeded awaie from her: made sure ynough, I meane, from persecuting any iniury that shalbe offered to your Q. and brought into that state, that the offerers maie be out of all feare of her. Yea rather see, whether they both, as mother and daughter, be not subiect and in perill to receiue one ende (though not in one place, nor perhaps at one time) as did the two Hargills, Father and Sonne.
            
               If Q. Elizabeth the widow of KingExamples. Edward ye fourth in th'apprehensions of the Lords Riuers and Graies, did wisely and truely foresee the destruction of the yong King her sonne: can not this Q. Elizabeth the Daughter of King Henry ye eight (being a Paragon of wisedome among women) foresee, what is towards her selfe, when the Duke of Norf. and Throgmorton be taken from her? And did the other Q. a widow forsee, ye death of her Sonne to hasten and approche, when his yong brother and Heire might be suffred no where, but in the murderers hands: and can not this Queene now (though a Uirgin for state, yet a widow for wisedome) forsee, how neere her owne ende draweth, when her Heire is alreadie in the handes of them, that haue circumuented her selfe to extinct her owne Line, and haue procured the others depriuation with the slaughter already of her husband and seruant? Doth Queene Marie of Scotland now plainely see, what Iames meant towardes her, when he abused her so much as to make her depriue her selfe of the

Earle of Huntley: and wil not Q. Elizabeth of England, by so fresh and manifest an example, be taught to see, what Sinon meaneth towards her, that circumuenteth her so much, as to make her to depriue her selfe of her Cosin of Norf?

                  ers are secure.Who about your Q. hath the head (now Throgmorton is gone) to meete with Sinons shrewd head, in ye foresight of her safety, or in espiyng his false crafts? Who about her hath the force, the frinds and zeale also, to defende her person, and to resist these Catilines malice, now the Duke of Norf. is gone? against them, I meane, that haue made them selues so strong. And who shall call those Caitifes to account (whiles the Q. of Scotl. remaineth in their powers, or when she shall be dead) for the force and oppression, that they shal offer your Q. which imminently now hangeth ouer her head?
            The Scottish Prince is an Infant, so (as bysides the hope they ha

               : and in ye time so to prepare also,

that he shall neuer come to full age. To leaue therefore the Q. of Scotl. in this maner a prisoner, at these mens order & deuotions to be made awaie at euerie sodaine, is a plaine promise and assurance to them of al securitie and indemnitie, for murdering of your Qu

               ene her selfe.
            As the Queenes of Scotl. life therefore is your Queenes preseruation: and her strength, and good state, is your Q. surety and assurance: euen so is the ende of the Q. of Scotl. life, the entry and beginning of your Queenes death, if either Historie of things past, or probable iugement of things present maie suffice to tell and teache her the truth of her owne state at this day.
            And hauing now compassed in this maner the extincting of the House and Line of England,Now against the Line of Scotl. and brought it euen to the brinke to be finally ended at euerie sodaine, when them selues list (and which hath by likelyhood no long time to tarry, now Norf. is gone, and the Q. of Scotl. ready to be gone after him): let vs now s

Only this, euery man maie see, was conteined therin: that wheras before she was without Children, & these Catilines thereby assured, that with her owne life her Line should finish: by this mariage now they founde them selues preuented of that hope, whervpon ensewed so cruel a persecution against ye Q. & her husbād, as giueth euidēce to al men, that her chiefe offence was, in prouiding by mariage to haue laufull Succession.

with the like deafe eare geuen then to the one, and now to the other.
            Beholde likewise the instrumentes  of the one than, and of the other now. Among the Clergie there lacked then no Shawes,Shaw. nor now no Sampsones.Sampson. Among the Lawyers there wanted than no Catisbees,Catisby. nor now no Nortons.Norton. And as a Duke of great dignitie,D. of Buck. wisedome, eloquence, courage and authoritie in the Realme was than found out, to aduaunce and solicite that vnnatural enterprise, as chiefe of the Councel, highest in rule, and principall Officer vnder the Prince than: euen so haue you one or twoo nowe, so farre from Dukes borne, that they be the first Gentlemen of their Genealogie, who for wisedome and wealth, for alliance now and creditte, for eloquence of tongue, for authoritie with your Prince, and for reuenew also, beeing equal or superiour to your Noblest of birth, and the chiefe Councellours and Magistrates of your present gouernement, that are the Capital contriuers of this treason now in hand.
            
               
                And like as for a gentle Brakenburie found than,Brakēbury, a noble Shrewsbury hath ben found now,Shreusbury of whome neither than, nor now, any hope could be had, to make them y• slaughtermen of such a shambles: euen so for a Caitif Knight founde out than, to whom Brakenburie must render the keies of those Innocents: I could name you an other Knight founde out now, to whome Shrewsburie muste yelde the custodie of this Queene. But whiles the choice is his owne to relent vnto, or resiste so vile a villanie: I will not doe him the iniurie (before his desert) by name to resemble him to Boutcherly Tirell.
            
                For priuate respects saith the Story, as partly for malice against the Queenes kinred, and partly for hope of an Earledome, was that Duke induced to abase him selfe to so vile an office, as to compasse that cruelty. And for like priuate respects of malice to some, and reuenge to others, & for hope of further aduancement yet to them selues, by bringing the Crowne to that Familie, to which them selues are vnited, & their succession

incorporated, doe a couple of Catilines now all this that they doe.
            The pretenses alleaged both of that, and of this (euery man seeth) are so farre from truth, that they passe probabilitie: all appearing, either plainly forged and fained of nothing, or of a mote a milstone made: or the innocent charged with the accusers crimes.

                Than consider, how the weakenes of that House growen by the attaindre of the last Duke of Suffolke, is now repaired againe, by vniting vnto it the House of Hartforde.
            
                Beholde, how lately the Remaine of that Line reasted in two soole and selly Ladies, destitute of parents, mariage, & indowment: and yet is now multiplied into choice of heires males.

the Question, by the traueill of Rob. Beale, in the yeare. 1563. and procured by the counsell of these two Catilines, and is reserued in secret, to serue the turne, when the daie commeth.
            Consider with this, the Books and  Libels spread & cast abrode in the yeare 1566. made in the preference of the Title of that Line and House only, and to the preiudice and disproufe of the Right of al other Heires, that by blood and Descent might claime before it: and copies of the same geuen out (in Print, as it is said) to remaine in the hands of the Fac

            Consider againe the seueritie vsed, to  suppresse and keepe out the booke, writtē in the defense of the Honour and Title of the Heires of the House of Scotland, descended from Margaret the elder Sister:

Wherof though I haue at some length treated already, & may therefore seeme (to some perhappes) ouer often to iterate one thing: yet shal I not long hold you therin, nor appeare tedious, I trust, to any indifferent Reader, that weyeth the importance, which

this cause carrieth in it, for so many diuerse and sundry respectes, as haue not yet bene spoken of, nor can here be all remembred. Let that Change of Religion, I say, be vewed by it selfe, stripped out of those vaine fables,Lies stripped from it. and idle lies, suggested to draw your Queene vnto it.
            And first, weede from it the vntrue surmise, that said the Change was conuenient, bycause she could not assure her selfe of her Catholiks, &c. as if they, that hauing all in their hands, receiued and settled her in her State: that euer since, I say (and for twelue years time no man wil deny) haue qui

            3. Take that lie also from it, that persuaded the Change to be requisite, to satisfie and winne the partie Protestant at home, feined to be the stronger factiō &c. Which was than so farre the weaker in deede, that none at all appeared, neither mēber, nor Head, no nor Sinon him selfe, y• than durst seeme to be of that side: and

when the Catholikes had in their hands the whole Gouernance and Authoritie, the Nauie, the Portes, the Armour, the Treasures, the Offices of credit, assured also of the aide and support (if your Q. stood indifferent) of the Sea Apostolike, of the King of Spaine, and of him of France also: who of purpose to attend the p

            4. Pare from it also that lie and false arte, that made your Queene beleue, that al Princes adioyning (to haue the spoile of their Churches) would folow her example in that attempt, &c. Whereas manifest experience hath taught euery man, not only that no one wil folow her: but also that both the chiefe, that is to saie, they of Spaine and France, haue consumed their treasures, haue bestowed the liues and bloud of their Subiectes in great numbers, both by battaile and iustice, and haue susteined al personal peril and danger of their States: rather then

they would admitte that Atheisme into their Countreis. And looke on Denmarke, Germany, Swetia, Polonia and Moscouiato, if you will: and see whether any one of them all can be induced by her example, to go one iote furder foreward, then they were before.
            Yea, looke on all the free Cities of Eastland, or els where, & on Hamborow it selfe, where they preache publikly, that who so lodgeth any man of the English Religion, is an hoste vnto Sathan, and lodgeth a Diuel in his house. And against their impudency, that will say all these Countreis and Cities last named were of your Religion before, and be all one with you: let their Churches decently adorned with images, let their Altars standing, let their doctrine of Christes reall presence in the Sacrament, let the vse of Auricular Confession, of Priuate Masse, of Latin Seruice, and of infinite other points of the olde Religion permitted to all that will: let euerie gate of their Cities, euery high waie in their Countreis, decked with Crucifixes, and Crosses, being all publike markes, and

            And to conclude, a change it is, to a Religion so plainely Turkish and Heathen, that no where hath it passed or fixed footing, without leauing behinde it the very printes and foote steppes of Machomettes Armado. Whereof let them be Iudges, that haue seene in Hungarie and Slauonie the decaied Cities, the wasted Countries, the ruined buildings of all sortes, and the desolate aspecte of al that falleth vnder

mans eie, where the Turks army hath pitched any time: and haue sene withall, and will compare therevnto the subuerted monasteries, the ouerthrowē Abbeis, the broken Churches, the torne Castels, ye rente Towers, the ouerturned walles of Townes and Fortresses, with the cō

Yea be your selues Iudges, yt for your yeres can remember the standing of your Abbeis, and doe now beholde the great difference and decay of al your owne greate Cities and Townes, where your Monasteries were planted, in comparison of the state, that the same were in, when the Catholike faith flourished among you.
            Many other like properties and qualities it hath, mo then can be shewed you particularly, which doe conteine danger, dishonour and disprofit to your Queene, and Realme euery way: but these be ynough, I trow, to shew it a change, and a change for the woorse. Wherin, if you thinke, that

            Consider your Statute made for the Othe of your Womanish Primacie,Eliz. An. 5. Cap. 1. which vnder great penalties of Premunire, and of death by Degrees, bindeth the inferiour multitude vnto that, wherein it leaueth the Nobilitie free. Waie wel the euident iniustice, and the passing absurditie of that Lawe, and ye shal find it as vile a practise, as filthie a fetche, and as dangerous a dishonour, as euer was contriue
                  •
               .
            The meaning of the Acte, ye wotte, conteineth as well matter of conscience betweene God, and mannes soule: as matter of duetie and bonde, betweene Prince and Subiecte. Nowe who euer heard, that the Gentleman and Yeoman, the Artisan, and the Labourer, haue to accounte for that before God,

Whereof the Baron, the Uicount, the Earle, and Duke stand free & not chargeable? As if y• 
               
                  •
               ne sort had soules, and the other none at al: or, as if the poore and meane man were bound in the sight of God, with hart to beleue, & with mouth to confesse so special a point of faith and Doctrine, wherof the Nobleman is free, and bound to neither of both.
            And was it euer heard of, or read before now, that any Monarch, or Prince, was more a King ouer his subiect, that is a Gentleman, or vnder: than ouer his Uassal, that is a Lord or aboue? Or that one of them was bounden to acknowledge such a Title, and Superioritie in his Soueraine, as the other might safely denie? Yea, the selfe and same, for the third refusall whereof the greatest number infinitely must by this Law die as Traitours, & the fewer number freely may, not only three times, but thirtene, thirtie, and three hundred times refuse it, and bid their King goe whistle him, and charge them withal, ouer whom he hath Authoritie in that behalfe? Looke you vpon the consequents, which of very iust

reason, that Law carieth in it. Let the Degrees be surueied betwene the lowest Labourer, and the greatest Duke in your Dominion. And according to the difference of their Dignities, let your Princes iurisdiction ouer them be rated and proportioned, in such wise, that ouer the highest sorte, his Regalitie be least: ouer the meaner and middle sorte, somewhat more: and ouer the lowest sorte, greatest of al, in as many different proportions, as there are differēces of degrees among your people: (for so of reason ought it to be, if this Law be an equal patterne and president) and than, shal you see your Kingly Prerogatiue and Authoritie, so measured and minced from more to lesse, til your Duke may accompt himselfe felow with his King, and the poore man must take his King for more then a God. Can any thing be thought vppon, more iniust and absurde before God and the worlde?
            Behold you also, how base, and filthie the practise was: that to winne somwhat in so vile an enterprise (which to al the Nobilitie appeared so farre out of

course, and so repugnant to reason, that they could not possibly be induced to yeelde them selues subiect to a yoke so exorbitant, and opposite both to Gods Law and mannes) the Caitifes so circumuented yet both the States, of the Nobilitie, and Commons, that the one accepted suche a Thraldome, as ne

            For was there euer practise more infamous, or perilous vnto the whole State of your Nobilitie, then by suche a meane to put a pike betweene themselues on the one partie, and all the Gentlemen and Cōmons of the Realme on the other partie, who should

But I tarie to long in opening the iniquitie of that, whiche is so manifest and so palpable an iniustice of it selfe. Lette vs therefore consider an other.
            Beholde likewise the equall Ordinance of your Wednesdaies fast:Eliz. An. 5. Cap. 5. where the riche sort, that are fewest, being hable to buy flessh and fissh, may freely eate both: and the poore sort most in number, being vnhable to buy fish, must either get white meate, or ea

his duty & office to his Soueraigne, that shalbe, or so muche as to haue his person or name fixed before the eies of his minde, to obey him the better, when the time shal come.
            And loke vpon the equalitie of that lawe, that creating a new crime of that, which was none, ordeineth the penaltie thereof, to haue relation, and to take place, from xiiij. yeares before the crime was constituted, or any offense committed. These things, you see, doe beare the names and titles of lawes. And were there euer things hard of, that more directely impugned common Iustice?
            Many examples mo might be brought you, of the open violation of the Iustice of your Realme, which I call ye rupture and ruine of the seconde wal and warde of your Common wealth, broken downe to bring in the hollow Horse that I haue tolde you of. Wherein abuse yourselues how you will, a

            Than, to restore her Cosin of Scotland  to her libertie, State, Honour, and fame: whose prosperitie (no doubt) is her owne assurance.
            Than, in one place or other to marry  her selfe at her owne good liking, sins yet she is not past hope of child-bearing.
            Than, to reduce her Nobilitie to their iust and woonted credit, and by their aduise  to gouerne hereafter.
            Than, to rule her people by Religion  and Iustice.
            And lastly, to repaire the wasted Treasures  of her Croune, by the dew search and iust correction of the bribery, corruptions, and oppressions long vsed vnto her Subiects.
            These shal she finde to haue bene the steps and presidents of her Royal Progenitors. And in these shal she finde true qui

And by these, shal she long (if God so please) enioye her Raigne, & ende it (when God wil) with the quiet and peace, that she began it.
            Which way if her pleasure be not to take, but that (either for fauour, or feare of the Faction that her selfe hath set vp) she shal make choice to runne on the race already begonne,The inconueniences of going forward. with what so euer euēt: it is not only likely, but it must be looked for, that she hath already seene the best and the quietest of her time.
            That she shalbe, as she hath bene, in euery thing almost, stil circumuēted more or lesse. Her name shalbe abused, her Authority missapplied, the Religion of her Realme so oft turned this way, and that way, til none at al shalbe leaft in her peoples harts, the Iustice of the same shalbe set as an harlot out to hyre, he

them, and they of no credit. She shal beare the Infamie of consuming the olde, and her Catilins shal haue the glorie of erecting the new. She weakened by the one, and they strengthened by the other. Her people shal obey her no farther, then feare of mans law shal enforce thē, her Forein frinds shal fal frō her, her Forein enemies shal grow insolent & glory ouer her, her Realme shal stil be impouerisshed and oppressed with Strangers, of whose loue nor seruice she can neuer be sure: of Forein inuasions euer in doubt, of tumults at home neuer assured, her Nobles brought low that should defend her, her Kinred consumed, that should stand by and succeede her, her securitie talked of, but nothing intended, the succession of her owne line in short time desperate, and she made the Instrument to extinct the next.
            Which when she hath done, and taken them away, whose liues are her suertie: then shal the time be ripe, vntimely also to make an ende of her owne, if God by some meane preuent not the malice of them, that this way leade her, for their own
