M.

ells then to moue and ſtirr vp diſcord and warres, euen now again at his retorn vnto Rome fearid not to diſſemble and cloke euen with God him ſelf, for although as before you haue hard he ſemid not to be ignorant of the truth yet when he was come to Rome (whether he wer ſuſpectid of Lutheranyſme and to auoid the ſuſpicion ther of or no, or ells that he did yt to gratifie the pope with all) he wrote a boke againſt kyng Henry theyght king of Englād intituled the defence of the vnity of the church in the which boke he conuerting his ſtyle vnto themperour he includid this moſt deteſtable peſtiferous yea and ſeditious oration againſt the king of Englād vnto whome he was not only

moſt neare ioined in affiniti and kindred but alſo as he him ſelf confeſſith moſt greatly bounden for his education and literature But now mark I pray you how the prick of his owne conſciens cauſid him to diſplay his owne hypocriſie when he had wrytten this boke hee canſid yt to bee imprintid at Rome at his own propet coſtes and charges and whē they wer thus printed he fearing leaſt yf they ſhold be caried a brod and come vnto the handes of ſuch vnto whome he had before profeſſid the contrari that then yt wold torne to his great ignominie and reproche toke all ye bokes into his owne handes & ſett none of them abrode ſauing a few whiche he gaue vnto the pope & certain cardinales whō
               me

he knew very well wold allow his doinges, Sed nihil occultum quod non reuelabitur. For God wold not ſuffer his church to be ſo much abuſed or deceauid by his hypocriſy but that at the length he wold bring yt to lyght for although theſe his doinges werby a long ceaſon kept cloſe & ſecret yet at the length they cam vnto the handes of one or to in Germanye who hath ſet theme forth to the eys of al men, And bycauſe all trew engliſh hartes ſhuld not be ignorant what a venemous viper they haue of late noryſhed euen in there own boſomes whiche ſought nothing els then to knaw a ſunder ye bowels and to deſtory his mother and coūtrei, I haue for the vſe & comodyty of all men tranſlatid

whiche goethe about and hath brought a great part of the ſame to paſſe, is ſuche a one as thou canſt not excuſe thy ſelfe o Ceſar but to vnderſtand and know the ſame. The which thyng as it is moſt laudable ſo dothe it alſo apere moſt neceſſari fyrſt to prouide and ſeke remedy for this myſchief  whiche is now ſpronge & growyng vpon vs before thou prouyde or ſeke for the lyberty of the body, & verely yt is ſo much the more neceſſary that except, you imediatly reſiſte and with ſtand this myſchief all that you now go about is but in vayn although you ſhuld ſubdew all aſai & expulſing the turkes frome thence you ſhuld retourne a conquerer. I pray you what ſhal you

Nether do thee turkes, hate or abhorre the name of Chriſt or reiect his goſpell but as the arrianes dyd in times paſt thei take awai that dignity from Chriſt that he ſhulde bee thee ſonne of God,The ariā
                with many other thinges which they haue taken of the arrianes how beit thy affirme chriſt to be a great prophet, and alſo owe no ſmall reuerence vnto his mother mary. The orygynall and begynyng

They wer the firſt which wēt away frō ye church forſaking and denienge him to be the hed whiche was ordeined and left by Chriſt and ſo by lytle & lytle  they vterly declined & ſwarued from the doctrine of Chriſt. what ſhuld I ſay more, do you you not ſee how largley & aboūdantly this turkiſh ſede is ſpred and ſowen amōgeſt vs. I wold to god yt wer ſo ſmall that you could not perceaue yt. But you haue  ſene that which is greatly to be ſorouid euen in your owen cōtry of germany, but as yet ther is not ye playn turkiſh ſede,The Turkiſh ſede in

            So likewiſe in Englād wher as in tyme paſt trew religiō did alſo floriſh now is this ſede ſo ſowen and ſtrengthened by thā
               ctorytuy of one man that it can ſtarſly be diſcernid frō the turkiſh ſede and to thin tēt that that which is alredi ſowē ſhuld haue the better encreſe it is defended withe the ſword, and with the

The which thing the greke monkes which inhabyte  the mont Athusdo wytnes to be trew whom the turkyſh emperour him ſelf doth much ſette by, in ſo much that he doth often ſend ſuch as haue offendyd vnto

ſo that fynally all mens tonges ar ſtoppid by feare of the ſwear.  what wold you deſire more o Ceſar whan thes goodly begynyngs this violence and cruelti whiche is exerciſed againſt holy men doth ſufficntly ſhew what peryll and danger is ryſen to the church by denieng and refuſing the heade of the church.
            Ye the turkes them ſelues againſt whome thou doeſt prepare warres may be an exāple for the, the which hauing this path or way opened vnto them haue attemptid to oppreſſe and ouerthorw the church of chriſt when as they reiectid and caſt of thauctoryty of the ſuperme head & in ſtede ther of haue brought in the force and rigour of the.
            
               Swerd thorow the which they haue ſo long a tyme defendid thē ſelues yt it is to late for the church to ſeke for, or call home hir children again whiche haue alredy forgotten ther mother. Yf the turkyſh ſect, do not ſufficientlye declare vnto you the greatnes & hougenes of the perill which I haue ſpoken of before. Germany it felfe doth ſhew it aboundantly if thou doeſt conſider wyth thy ſelfe how quiet, how peaceable, and religious a prounce it hath bene in tymes paſte, and finallye howe plentifull and aboundant it was in all thinges, ſo long as it contynwed in the vnytye of ye church. Contrarywyſe yf you do marke theſe late dais or times in ye which it is vexed and troubled

with inteſtine and cyuyle warres after yt it had refuſed & reiectid ye head of ye church it is ſo toſſed & troubled that all hope of recouery or end of there myſchiefs is vtterly paſt except (as god graūt they may) they do retorne again to thee vnity of ther head and church. Verely this acknowleging of one hed or Gouernour hath alwais benethe moſte ſure and ſtrong fort and defence of ye church. This ye herytikes aboue all thinges do chyefly aſſaille & inuade this ſame the catholykes do alwais defend, yea and Ceſar him ſelf. like wiſe of late was it alſo defendid in England euen, of the nobles being the children of ye chuch in ſo murch yt thei thought it better to offer ther maked

bodyes vnto ye weapons of their enemyes rather then they wold forſake that only fort and ſtrong hold the which being once ſubdewed & ouercome thenemyes of chriſt myghty haue eaſy paſſage to aſſail & ouerthrow the church Notwithſtanding they haue vaanquiſſed and ſlayne diuerſe myghty men children of the church which ſought to with ſtād them. The which thing it is no▪ maruaill though it com ſo to paſſe for ſo much as tehnemys haue a king to bether gwyde and Capytaine. As yet in all the great  myſeries and calamyties which haue happened vnto the church ther was neuer no kinge which had conceiuid anny peruerſe or cōtagious opiniō againſt the ſame,

but now it hath ſo inuadid ye hart of our kinge that he doth defende and mayntaine this his  ſecte euen by thee very ſame meanes as the turk doth mahumet ſhewyng & ſhaking his nakid and drawenſwerd vnto al ſuch as dare once diſſent or diſagre from hym. Nether doth he ſo muche deſyre any thyng as yt he myght haue tyme and ſpace to confyrme and eſtablyſhe hym ſelf that he myght bring a greater myſchief and plague vpō the church then hath at any tyme before bene wrought by any turke and ſuerley he wyll do noleſſe yf he obtayne that which he doth deſire and goo about.
            Wylt thow then o Ceſar: which ſayeſt yt thou bereſte ſuch

a zeale and loue vnto the chriſtiā comon welth that thou wylt do althinges for thee louee therof, graunt or gyue hym this time & ſpace, Seing this parte of the Comō wealthe thus vexed criēg and calling for thy helpe ayd & ſocour ſeing their ruyne ſo nere that remedi can not be any more prolonged yf yt ſhulde any thing at all profit.
            But you couert your hole force and poure another wais ſo that what thorow your far dyſtance & abſence and your doubtfull warres againſt ſo myghty an enemye all hope is vtterly takē away that you can by any meanes help or ſuccour vs in ſeſō as them whome you go now to deliuer out of bondage, wylt thou

then o Ceſar fruſtrate thexpectacion of all thy frindes eſpecially ſeing that the truſte and confidēce which thy haue in you is thonly cauſe whye the haue not as yett tryed ther owen force and pouer at home nether haue attēptid to defend them ſelues by their owne ſtrēgth. do not hinke  Ceſar that all the noble ſpirytes and Courages ar gone out of the engliſh mens harts nether Iudge that al the loue of ſincere & pure religiō is vtterlye extinct in them. A ſure coniectour & tryall you maye haue her of by the death of thē which wil nigly haue yeldyd them ſelues to their enemyeis to be offred vp for relygiōs ſake. If god in the tyme of helias the prophete preſeruide

ſeuē thouſād men which had not bowed their knes vnto baal from thee wycked Achab when they ſhuld haue bene ſlayn thorough ye perſwaſiō of his wicked wyfe Iezabel, do not think that in this tyme in the which ye grace of the holye goſt is muche more ſpred  abrode that this wycked Iezabel though ſhe be neuer ſo ſwyft vnto ſlaughter coulde haue put to death all the trew worſhipers of religion. Beleue me ther remayn yet hole legions in England of thoſe which haue not bowed their knees vnto Baall whome, whollye and altogether yf thou do come God hym ſelf whiche hath preſeruid them will bring them vnto you. The Englyſhmē o Ceſar ar euen the very ſame

which for a muche lighter cauſe euen them ſelues wihout any external help or ayd haue taken vengeance on their owen kinges for the euil adminiſtration of the comon wealth. They which alſo haue called ther kinges to accompt for the waſtfull ſpending of ther mony to thee domage of the comon wealth and whē they could not approue & iuſtify the ſame they compellid them to reſigne both croune and ſtrepter whoſe coragions and ſtout ſtomacks for ſo much as they do yet remain nothing doth ſtay nether  hath ſtayd them a great while frō reuenging thinium of their king but only the hope & expectation which they had in you. vnto whome they thought this matter ſo muche to pertayn, that except

you wold defraud your, owne nature, which by many your worthi actes thei wer perſuadid to be moſt noble or els that you wolde ſet a ſyde all loue of religion the which it hath aperid you to be moſte ſtudiōs & deſirous of: that they wer aſſured yt you could not but you muſt neds take this mater or cauſe vpon you. For they ſuppoſe vereley yt throughe you their euell mai much more eaſili withe leſſe trouble and danger, vnto the kingdome be remedyed and withſtand, then yf they them ſelues ſhuld haue attemptid it with their owen pouer & ther in ſuerly they Iudge well and worthely do loke for you. But whether now o Ceſar doeſt thou fley ſo fare frō thē, what thing doth

draw the away ſo farr from thy frindes leuing ſo great an ocaſiō miniſtred ye at home and to go wher ther is leſſe dāger. do thy ſouldiars draw the that way? Or is their willes more bent towarde thee affaires of theaſt parte wher their aunciēt enemyes are then to ward the weſt wher new enemys are Ryſen?
            What Souldyars bee they o Ceſar? If thei be the Spaniards to whome of Ryght thou doeſt much truſt whoſe glory alſo in dyuerſe battaills hath largely apearid: Truly yf they hard or ſawe that noble progeny or ofſpringe of Iſabel oppreſſed with myſery and calamytye in a moſt Iuſt cauſe deſyring or requiring their help and ayd I know Ceſar

that the memory of that moſt worthy woman is not yet ſo fare out of their mind that they wold vtterly fruſtrate the deſyres and requeſtes of her moſt worthy doughter. I know ther is nothing ſo acceptable vnto them which they wold not wyllingly refuſe and Leue of to healp this noble woman whome thonly honor of the knygdome of ſpayne▪ which herin is chyefly ſought wold ſufficyently moue ther vnto yf they dyd but only heare or vnderſtand, that ye king of ſpain his doughter being by the ſpace of .xx. yeres coupled in mariage to be thruſt out of the kinges palaice for a harlottes cauſe as though ſhe had bene ye doughter of ſome light perſon or of ſome

boure or els had come bi ſtealth frō the futher parts of barbarye vnto the kinges chamber & not to haue had ſo noble a kinge to her parent Or that ſhe had ryghfully bene geuen him to wyfe out of ſo noble a kingdome, wolde they with a quiet mind ſuffer ſo great a iniury which ſcarſly mā of the baſeſt ſort wold beare or ſuffer. And wher as ther cane ſcarſly any man be found of ſo couerdly a ſtomack which wold not by all means poſſible euen with the perill of his lyfe ſeke to reuenge ſuche an opprobri done vnto his doughter: wold not the Spanyards, whoſe valiant courages hath bene experimētid the ſemani yeres in ſondri victoryes reuenge the iniurye of their kinges

doughter, how I ſay can the noble nation of the ſpainyardes neglect or think any thing to bee preferrid before this ſo great an iniurye which doth both deface ther victories and moſt manyfeſtly aſſault your honour and the glory & renowne of ſpain. what thing can be more ignominious or ſlaūderous vnto you then ſo muche to eſteme other nations that ſpain ether wyll not or can not reuēge ſuch a contumelious iniuri done, vnto them. But truly yt can not ſo bee thought. The whiche that thou maiſt euydently know ſuffer me (o Ceſar) only to ſpeak vnto thy ſouldiars and thou ſhalt ſee them all with one accorde as ſone as they ſhall here the doughter of quene Izabell

and thy neuew once named deſiringe ther ayd and healpe redy yf thou wilt ſuffer them to alter their, courſe and iourney. But I (Ceſar) require or deſire nothīg of the nor of thi ſouldiars for thy coſynne katherines ſake. Nether will ſhe anye thing to be ſpoken in her behalfe complainyng nothing at al of her vnfortunate eſtate but willingli bearith ye vnſtability of fortune yt which hathe ſo ſhewid her cruelty vpon her yt euen in the tyme in the which thou dydeſt moſt floryſh & ſhe ought to hau floryſhed & ſhe was caſt downe into a moſt myſerable ſtate & cōdiciō, iea & by how much thy affaires dyd moſt ſuccede and go forward with the: ſo much the more iniuriouſly and

greuuoſly ſhe was handled and oppreſſid. But of her ſelf priuatly ſhe doth nothing complain or ſay nether of her one cauſe, it is for england o Ceſar that ſhe cō
               playnyth to whome it is geuen into the which as a noble plāt or graft ſhe is trāſlatid & grafted yt whiche contrey alſo ſhe ought to loue as her owne & truli doeth it. For this Cōtrey ſhe doth entreate for ſo much as her cauſe is ſo knit bi al meanes poſſible with yt cauſe of this moſt noble & her derly be loued prouince, and coūtrey, that her cauſe beyng neglectid it muſt nedes folow thee contrey alſo to be in moſt euil eſtate. More ouer what a peaſable and quiet prouince ſhe found at her commyng thyther, and now how yt is vexid

with ſeditious and inward warres, thee whiche can not happen without her great hurt and detriment, for ſo muche as her cauſe is ſo vnited and knyte with religion: So that yf ſhe be forſakē, it muſt nedes folow religion to be deſtitute, thee ancyēt fayth of the churche to be aboliſhed and new ſectes to ſpring and riſe, not only  in the Iland which ſhe foūd moſt religious and holy: but alſo thorough the contagion of the ſame to infect and ſpred ouer all other countreys & prouinces, and therby finalli al the hole church to be perturbed and troubled. If this myſchief be ſuch that none can be more greuous, in the which alone all other myſchiefs ar conteynid and is ſene, not by coniecture or

This ſhe doth make interceſſione for, euen for thaffinity that is betwene her and you, for the honour of the kindome of ſpain, vnto thee whiche chyfe reſpect is had in this mater, and for the health of the criſtian common wealth, ſhe doth moſt humbly deſire you that you will not think any thing, to be preferrid before this moſt holy and publyque vtilyti and oportuniti & vnto your
