               GEntlemen, our Diuines do tell vs, that Ioſeph of Arramathaea made his Tumbe in his lyfe time, and in the middeſt of his Garden; to this ende queſtionles, to put him ſelfe in minde of death, in the middeſt of his pleaſures: And ſeeing the life of a Chriſtian ſhould be continually exerciſed in the meditation of Death, by reaſon of the continuall conflictes which we ſuffer: not in reſpect of any open enemie, but in regarde of our ſecret ſinnes. Euery day, euery houre, euery moment, and in euery place, the Deuill fighting agaynſt vs: the worlde with his delyghtes, and the fleſh with his pleaſures in ſo hot an aſſault, as doth admit no peace, nor ſuffer any truce,

I thought good to preſent you with this Anatomie of Death, that in the middeſt of your delightes, you may take a view of him, who will in the ende, cut off all your delights. Accept it as I import it, the Pawne of my good deſire to pleaſure you, and Bill for your aſſurance, to receaue greater things at my hand, when opportunitie ſhall ſerue: in the meane time, as you tender the health of your body, ſo likewyſe care for the health of your ſoule: remembring, that Death to the wicked, is the high way to Hell: but Death to Gods chyldren, is the path-way to Heauen.

               GOod Sir, I haue receaued your Letters, the meſſengers of your ſorrowe, and the workers of my griefe: for that I now miſſe alouing kind Neighboure, as you do want a kind louing Father. And if the moſt renowned king Dauid, notwithſtanding the great enmitie betwixt Saul and him, did ſhed as many teares from his eyes, when he heard that his enemie was murdered, as there did iſſue droppes of blood from Sauls body

I truſt my Chriſtian ſorrow for my friend, ſhalbe chriſtianly excuſed, ſith that it is a naturall thing for one man to haue compasſion vpon an other: and of all worldly loſſes which we receiue by death, the loſſe of ſuch a friende is very bitter; although now by death he hath gayned an eſtate which is incomparably bet

And where as I vnderſtande by your Letter, ſo many in number, ſo excellent in qualitie, ſo comfortable in his extremitie; both for the quicknes of his ſence, and the quietnes of his conſcience, and readines of his memorie: that if he would haue wiſhed longer lyfe, then that he lyued, or more Worſhyp, then that he inioyed, or greater wealth then that he poſſeſſed, yet he could not haue deſired at the

handes of God, a more heroyicall gyft, then the grace he had, to die in his grace: becauſe, as puniſhment is ioyned to his diſpleaſure, ſo glorie is alwayes knit to his gracious fauour. Therefore (good Sir) hencefoorth ſurceaſe your ſorrow, leaſt you be charged to grieue at his ſolace. And ſeeing the preuiledge to die well, is onely allotted to them whom God hath giuen the grace to liue well: endeuour as you are by nature, ſo in lyfe and death, you may ſhew your ſelfe his Sonne: that as death tooke Manaſſes cutting his Corne, and binding vp his Sheaues; ſo death, when death knockes at your gate, may finde your Auguſt paſt, and your Harueſt at an ende: (I meane not of your Corne which growes in Swallowcliſfe-fielde) but of the thoughtes which flowe from your hart.

            A lyuely Anatomie of Death, &c.
            
               WE ſee it verefied by experience, that all earthly and tranſitorie things haue their ende, to the which they tend. Our very yeares are limitted, God hath meaſured out our moneths, the dayes of our liues are dated, how long we haue to liue. So that our firſt leſſon (euen at the beginning) that we haue to learne, is this, to thinke of our ending. Wee ſee that the longeſt day paſſeth, and the night ſucceedeth: howe ſummer followeth winter, and winter ſummer. The ſunne it hath both his riſing, and his ſetting, his ſhining and his ſhading. The ſpring time hath his courſe in couering,

and clothing the ground with fruites. Summer it rypens them, Harueſt gathers them, and winter ſpends them. Thus one thing followeth another: and both one and another paſſe ſwiftlie to their end. The generation of one thing is the diſtruction of another, and the death of one thing is the life of another: firſt is our generation, then our conception, after comes our birth in wonderfull weakeneſſe, our cradle is our caſtle, when we haue once crept out of that, we come to a little ſtrength: yet long is the time eare we come to ripeneſſe. And here (behold) we neuer continue in one ſtate: for as our ſtrēgth increaſed at the firſt, ſo by little, and little it diminiſheth at the laſt. As youth ſucceedeth childhood, and age youth: ſo childhood, youth, and age, haue all their end. We prooue by experience, that the freſheſt and ſweeteſt flower ſoone fadeth, and hath his fall: our garments waxe olde, be they neuer ſo gay:

our buildings become ruinous be they neuer ſo ſtately: And as our life is vpholden by the death of Gods creatures: ſo death ſhall be the end aſwell of vs, as of them. But to come neere to my purpoſe, you ſee the former yeare, which was new, is both olde, and ended: the new yeare which is now entered, requireth a new gift, a debt I may call it, which your deſerts may challenge for a dutie. That which I write, I wiſh, God onely muſt giue it: yet (through him) I offer it, God graunt you may well accept it. A poſey therefore I preſent, moſt fitteſt for your ſtate, which is both freſh, and faire, ſweete, and ſauerie: which neither the froſt of Winter can ſo bite, or the heate of Summer ſo parche, or any ſtorme or weather whatſoeuer ſo aſſayle, but that it ſpringeth, ſmelleth, taſteth, and laſteth for euer. Memento mori: Remember to dye. Recordare nouiſsima, Remember your latter end: this is your Poeſey, and

you ſhall neuer doe amiſſe, this is the ſmell, this is the ſent of your Noſegay, which if you apply dayly to your ſences, it will perfume your ſoule and body, that all without you, and within you, ſhall be as a ſweete odour, and flagrant incenſe, to the Lorde of Hoſtes.
            Nowe to make profite of this poſey, remember (I beſeech you) that ſithence we liue, mooue, and haue our being in God, that therefore our liues are not our owne, but lent vs for a time. Remember that we are borne to dye, and dye to liue: If this once were beaten into our braines, we would not ſo much deceiue our ſelues. For the forgetfulneſſe of death, and hope of life, makes vs ſo ſecure, and careleſſe, as that we deſire no other heauen, then earth. Many make a couenant with Death, and clap hands with the graue, hoping thereby to eſcape, and ſo bathe themſelues in their fleſhly pleaſures, and

wallowe like Swine in their filthineſſe, following things apparant to the eyes, neuer regarding the time to come, till death preuent them of a ſudden, and ſommon them to appeare before their Iudge: ſo it comes to paſſe, that as they liued wickedly, ſo they dye moſt miſerablie. Their hope is as the winde, and their confidence like the Cobweb. Death is a terrour, and a tormentour, both to ſoule and body: and this is the reaſon, they haue not learned to dye. Death is ſtrange vnto them, he ſeemes an vgleſome monſter, they dare not once beholde him. True it is, that Death in it owne nature is moſt terrible to beholde, that the ſight thereof amazeth all our ſences: yet he that is armed with faith, is well aſſured, that it is ſent for his profit, to be his packhorſe to carry him from earth, to heauen: from paine, to pleaſure: from miſery, vexation, griefe and woe, to endleſſe mirthe, melodie and ioyes vnſpeakable

with God for euer. To the ende therefore that the remembrance of Death driue vs not to diſpaire, but may rather comfort vs in our conflicts, it will not be amiſſe (if according to my skill) I ſhew you ſome Anatomie, in which you may ſee (as in a glaſſe) the originall of Death, and from whence it came, what it is by nature, with the power, ſtrength, and ſting thereof: and what through Chriſt to the faithfull. Laſtly, a preſeruatiue, or at leaſt a preparatiue againſt the ſame, ſo that it may rather helpe vs then hurt vs.
            Firſt, touching the originall and beginning of Death, it ſeemeth doubtfull from whence it came, & what Auctor it had: for although the iſſues thereof be in the hand of God, and that it is his handmaide to execute his will (as he alſo fetters the very diuels themſelues, who can do nothing without him) yet all the creatures that God made were very good, and as he is the very goodneſſe

it ſelfe: ſo can nothing but good proceede from God. And therefore ſince Death, and the diuell, be enimies to God and goodneſſe, be deſtroyers and corrupters of nature, which he had made, they are none of his creatures, he is neither their Auctor, nor they of his offpring. From whence then came Death? it proceeded from the diuell. God (ſaieth the wiſe man) created Adam without corruption, and made him after his owne Image: yet through enuie of the Diuell, came Death into the worlde, and they that holde of his ſide, prooue it. So that the father of Death is the Diuell: and as he is ill by nature, ſo is Death in it ſelfe iſſuing and proceeding from ſuch a Fountaine. The Diuell is the Auctor of ſinne, and conſequently of Death: for by Sinne, Death entred, and Death is the wages thereof. He that committeth ſinne, is of the diuell: for the diuel ſinneth from the beginning, he is a murtherer from the beginning, he is

both a lyar and the father thereof: not by creation, but by corruption. God made him an Angell, he made himſelfe a diuell. So falling from God, he fell from goodneſſe, and became the father of ſinne and wickedneſſe. Non ſtetit in veritate: he ſtood not in the trueth. Now being thus transformed, from an Angell to a diuell, and that of himſelfe, not of God, who made him good, he loſt the prerogatiue of his creation, and ſo was altered both in name & nature. Now being falne, obſerue his fetches, (being that enuious man) he repined at the ſtate of man, made like to God: He came couertlie to Heuah in the ſimilitude of the Serpent, and after long allurements, caught her in his ſnare, that ſhe conſented. So being ſnared, ſhe bends her force to catche her huſband alſo: and indeed preuailed. Marke the diuels proceedings, and ſee what hookes he had hidden, vnder his fine and pleaſant baites. Firſt he bewitches

her ſences with a faire ſhew, and goodlie taſte of the fruite forbidden. Secondly he aſſaileth them with infidelitie and doubtfulneſſe of Gods worde pronounced: namely, that they ſhould dye the death, and puts in peraduentures. Thirdly, he oppoſeth himſelfe to the vndoubted trueth of God, ſetting downe the contrarie, You ſhall not dye. Laſtly he pricks them forwarde to pride and ſelfe loue, You ſhall be as Gods, you ſhall be as cunning as the higheſt in good and euill. So the poore creatures, not leaning to God, nor asking counſell at his worde, but truſting to themſelues, and beleeuing his vaine and ſtrong deluſions, they yeelde and came to his lure: and in yeelding, were ſeduced, and ſo ſnared, and holden with the cordes of their owne ſinne, and fetters of their owne finding out. Then through this diſobedience, comes the iuſtice of God to reuenge it ſelfe on man, and the penaltie which it exacted,

was death appointed, and due by God to their diſobedience.
            See therefore nowe the petigree of Death, and of what parentage it proceeded. Came it from God? (I ſay) no; but was deriued from the diuell, by the meanes of ſinne, which he brought into the worlde, whoſe ſtipend and wages, is death and damnation: the oucrthrowe of mankinde, an enemy to nature, the breache of Gods lawe, the power of the diuell, the ſtrength of Gods wrath, and moſt heauie diſpleaſure; And albeit that Death (as I haue ſaid) be deriued from the diuell, yet it is alſo attributed to man himſelfe, to leaue him inexcuſable, as it moſt plainlie appeareth in Paules compariſon betweene Christ and Adam. As by the offence of one man (ſaith he) Death raigned ouer all, and ſinne came on all to condemnation: ſo by Chriſt, which is one, the benefit of grace abounded towards all men to iuſtificatiō of life: and as ſinne by Adam,

               reigned vnto Death: ſo grace reigned by righteouſneſſe vnto eternall life through Chriſt. In which oppoſition we may likewiſe ſee Death attributed vnto all, through Adam, and not vnworthily: ſo that man and diuell, are partners in ſinne, and ſo in Death. Here two things runne together: the tempter and the obeyer. Satan tempted, and perſwaded of enuie, intermingling the matter, with lying and ſlandering of the truth to breake Gods commandement: yet notwithſtanding all this, Satan had nothing preuailed, had man reſiſted, and not conſented: therefore we may conclude, that in reſpect of Sathans enuie, and roote of his euill temptation and lying, tending all to mans vndooing, and vtter deſtruction, that ſo he may be called (as he is indeed) the Auctor of Death: yet in reſpect of the aſſent & conſent of man in tranſgreſſing Gods lawe, Death may well lye on his neck, and he may moſt boldly be accounted

his owne bane, though indeede there were no other Autor, being created to the likeneſſe of God himſelfe, and flouriſhing with free will, which (as then) he poſſeſſed. The diuell then is not the abſolute and proper cauſe of ſinne and death, becauſe the nature of the abſolute, and proper cauſe is ſuch, that it going before, the effect cannot chooſe but follow: but it falleth not out ſo in man, prouoked of the deuill: who although he continually aſſaile, and moſt vehemently aſſault Gods children to ſinne: yet ſinne doth not alwayes follow his aſſaults. His worke is not effectuall, for many of Gods ſaints and ſeruants very mightily reſiſt him, being armed with faith: which weapon he flyeth. Againe, let vs imagine (ſaith a godly father) the diuell himſelf neuer to haue falne from God and man (as yet) to haue ſtoode in his creation: yet man by nature might haue declined, and ſhould haue had indeed the cauſe of ſinne in himſelfe:

the reaſon is this; God gaue him free will, and ſo left him to himſelf: free it could not be, but that he had full choiſe of good and euill: yet not ſo vnarmed and naked was he left, but that God gaue him power and ſtrength ſufficient to continue in his vpright ſtate: albeit he leaning too much one waye, and ſliding from Gods lawe, and not vſing, but rather abuſing the meanes that God had giuen him, he fell of himſelfe from his creation, and ſo was intangled in the ſnare of the diuell, death, and euerlaſting condempnation: ſo that in this ſuppoſition the ſuggeſtion of the diuell is not ſimplie the cauſe of ſinne and death (the diuell as yet not degenerating from God.) Neither alſo hath the diuell power of mans will to bowe it (as he liſteth) to his purpoſe. Furthermore, we muſt not thinke that God is to be blamed, for not ſhutting all gates, and ſtopping all gaps tending to ſinne: for that (as I ſayd before) he

gaue to man, armour ſufficient to defend himſelfe, and to keep him from falling. Neither yet was it vnagreeable to Gods iuſtice, to make a diſtinction betweene himſelfe and his creature, for that he himſelfe is only good, without change or alteration, all his creatures good, yet ſubiect to change: yea in the very Angels of heauen themſelues (in reſpect of God) there is found imperfection, the Cherubins hide their faces with their wings, for the brightneſſe of his glory.
            Thus doth God humble all his creatures to exalte himſelfe, to teach them this, not to go from him, of whom they had, and haue their goodneſſe, nor to leane onely to themſelues (though by creation good) yet ſubiect to corruption. Though mans nature (ſaith Auguſtine) was vpright and ſound, and nothing ſinfull, yet it was capable of ſinne & apte to receiue corruption. Though man in his nature were immortall (ſtanding

in his ſtate) yet was he inclinable to mortalitie. As for example; we ſee our fleſh apte to receiue a wound, yet euery one is not wounded. The body of man is ſubiect to ſiekneſſe, yet many often dye, not ſubiect to ſickneſſe: ſo the ſtate of Adams body was ſuch, that although he might haue dyed, yet (except ſinne had come betweene) he might and ſhould haue beene preſerued of God from death. Euen as the hoſe and ſhooes of the Hebrewes in the deſert by Gods mightie power neuer waxed olde, by wearing or conſumption. Therefore to hedge vp this gap, man was ſubiect to death by nature, yet not neceſſarily, as though he ſawe no way to ſhunne it: for now I go no further then mans knowledge, ſetting Gods election and ſecret working aſide: for he had ſufficient force giuen him of God in his creation, to auoide it. Gods lawe was written in his heart agreeable to his nature: he thought it

no yoake or ſlauerie to obſerue it, his ſhoulders, and other parts being ſtrong enough to ſuſteine it. Sinne therefore we may ſee, hath diminiſhed our ſtrength, and altered our nature, that now we are ſlaues to thoſe, who before were our ſubiects. Gods law now written, is the ſame that before were ingrauen in nature: yet now it is a huge weight, and heauie yoake, which neither we, nor our fathers were able to beare, except we be firſt new borne in by the holy Ghoſt, giuen vs of God through Chriſt. So that to conclude this point, not only the diuell, but euen we our ſelues are the cauſe and auctor of ſinne, and ſo of Death. Although indeed (as Auguſtine alledgeth) An ill thing hath no cauſe efficient, but rather deficient. And if any man (ſayth he) wyll goe about ouer curiouſlie to ſearche out the efficient cauſe of Death, it is all one, as if a man ſhould labour with his eyes to ſee darkeneſſe, or to bend the

ſence of his eares to heare ſilencc, which ſince they bee of themſelues meere depriuations, haue no eſſence in nature, though exiſtent in ſome ſubiect, and knowne vnto vs. The ſight ſeeth nothing but bright things, and the eare heareth nothing but a noyſe of loude things: theſe thinges are knowne to our ſences, not by vſe, but by depriuation onely. The deficient cauſe, and Autour therefore of ſinne and Death, is Diuell and Man: the diuell by ſuggeſting, the other by obeying: both their actions not vrged of God, but voluntarily of themſelues. Learne therefore this by the way, whoſoeuer committeth ſinne is of the diuell: whoſoeuer ſinneth is the ſeruant of Death. Neither let vs ſo rage againſt the Deuill, as that we altogether exempte our ſelues from gilte, but rather knowing the readineſſe of the diuell, in aſſayling, and our owne willingneſſe in obeying, we may both renounce the

Diuell, and forſake our ſelues, & cleaue onely in this extremitie to the Lord. Out of this original of Death, we may fetche the definition: wherein let vs conſider what it is in nature of it ſelfe, without Chriſt, what ſting it hath, and of what power and ſtrength it conſiſteth? Death in it ſelfe, is not onely a killing of the body, but alſo a ſleying of the ſoule: not onely a ſeparation of ſoule from body, but a diuiſion and cutting off, both of ſoule & body from God. Death therefore is two folde, to wit, corporall and ſpirituall: yet both of them, the ſtipends and rewards of ſinne, and both of them due to all without exception: For all ſinned, and are deſtitute of the grace of God. This corporall death (as I ſaid) is a ſeperation of the ſoule from the body, and is called the firſt death. Spirituall death, is a cutting off, of the ſoule from God, and excluding and ſhutting out of the ſame, from the bleſſed and ſweete countenance

of God, which is life it ſelfe: and this is called the ſecond death; common (I ſay) to all by reaſon of ſinne, yet not preuayling ouer Gods children, for whoſe ſinnes Chriſt hath ſatiſfied. Death therefore at a worde, is nothing elſe but a departing from life, and the life of the body is the ſoule: therefore the ſeperation of the ſoule from the body, is death. And as the ſoule is life to the body, ſo the life of the ſoule is God: therfore the going or departing of the ſoule from God (to cleaue to ſinne) is the death alſo of the ſoule. Without God there is no lyſe: therefore Adam and Euah, departing from God, departed from life: and although their ſoules were not preſently ſeperated from their bodyes, yet being gone from God, their life; they lay (as it were buried) in their bodies, as alſo their bodies themſelues, euery moment ſubiect to corruption. So ſoone as man by ſinne turned himſelfe from God:

euen ſo ſoone was he deſtitute of his grace and fauour, that he could not ſo much as once aſpire to felicitie, ſo tha
                  •
                preſently the ſouldiers of death beſieged his body, to wit; hunger, thirſte▪ ſickneſſe, ſorrow, and all kinde of calamities. So ſoone as euer they had ſinned (ſaith Chryſoſtome) euen ſo ſoone did the Lorde pronounce ſentence o

                death againſt them. And euen as thoſe that are condempned of the Iudge, although for a while (perhaps) they may be reſerued aliue in priſon, and be repriued, yet in effect they are accompted but for dead men. Euen ſo our firſ

Whereby we haue to learne, that the life of ſinners is no life (indeed)

                  eſt, but thou art dead. Hereof Chriſt calleth the Phariſees painted ſepulchres, whoſe ſoules were dead in their bodies for want of faith: hereof he ſaid to the young man, Let the dead burie the dead. And Paule to the wanton widowe, that being aliue ſhe was but dead: Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand vp from the
               
               dead, and Chriſt ſhall giue thee light: you hath he quickened, which were dead in your treſpaſſes and ſinnes. By this that hath bin ſpoken, we may ſee, not one, but all are ſubiect to the ſpirituall death, being full of ſinne and diſobedience, and ſo remaine, (thoſe onely excepted) which are quickened by Chriſt, and are buryed by Baptiſme into his death, to die to ſinne, and liue to righteouſneſſe, to the glory of him that dooth quicken them. And as faith in Chriſt, is the lyfe of the ſoule being dead through ſinne: ſo no faith can quicken vs, which is not liuely in it ſelfe, namely which apprehendeth not Chriſt, which worketh not by loue, which flouriſheth not with fruites: for faith without good fruits, is dead. And therfore to the end we may be reuiued (being buried in our ſinnes) we muſt firſt beleeue in Chriſt, which is our lyfe. If our beliefe be liuely, we muſt ſhew it forth by our fruits: otherwiſe we may haue a name to liue, and

yet be dead. Nowe to vnderſtand this pointe the better: learne what it is to be dead in ſinne. They are ſayd to be dead in their ſinnes, whom Death ſtill holdeth in the fetters and cordes of their ſinne, who cannot ſo much as mooue themſelues to any goodneſſe, who haue no ſence or feeling either of Gods mercie or their owne miſeries. Thoſe to whom all goodneſſe is vnſauerie, whoſe bodies and ſoules are holden captiues of the diuell, whom they ſerue as ſlaues, which are like the deafe Adder, that ſtoppeth her eares, and will not heare the voyce of the charmer, charme he neuer ſo wiſely: ſuch as are wedded to their owne wicked willes, whom the God of this worlde hath ſo blinded, that they can neither heare nor beleeue the truth: whoſe conuerſion is as hard, as to raiſe vp ſonnes of ſtones vnto Abraham. Here we ought to learne to lothe ſinne, which brings vs in ſuch thraldome to Death and diuell, which

cuts vs off from God, ſhuts vs out of heauen, robs vs of ſaluation, brings the wrath of God vpon vs: which is vnmeaſurable and infinite, and neuer able to be fully ſatisfied, but by only Chriſt, who is infinite and of like maieſty with God his father. Nowe to the end that the goodneſſe of Chriſt, and his grace, (which hereafter I minde to ſpeake of) may more appeare, in ſo miraculouſlie deliuering vs from the power of death, and the deuils tyrranie; it will not be amiſſe to ſet out the force, ſtrength, & ſting thereof, that the power of Chriſt in vanquiſhing the ſame, may more be magnified. The originall you haue heard already, as alſo the diſcription, who be ſubiect to it, and their ſtate in this their thraldome: Now therefore marke, that as the diuell, and man together brought in death, by ſinning, ſo it now being entred, is become the very kingdome of Satan, wherin he exerciſeth his tyrranny. By this death he

ſheweth his triumphing ouer man, whome he ſo ſeduced in holding him ſo faſt fettered in the linkes of his owne ſinnes, and ſo hath him as his ſlaue, is counted as his Prince, and ruleth ouer him as a head. God did renounce vs, although he created vs, and caſt vs of, whom he had made: euen to the forme of his Image. And as through ſinne, he gaue vs ouer to the deuill: ſo he iuſtly appointed the meanes to hamper vs: neither was this his doing contrarie to his iuſtice; nay rather if he had not ſo done, he ſhould haue ſeemed to deny himſelfe, and to be repugnant to his worde pronounced. In the beginning he created man, in righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, according to his owne ſhape and likeneſſe. So long as he kept this forme, he enioyed his bleſſed preſence, his protection and prouidence ruled ouer him. He wanted nothing that was neceſſary for him, all creatures were his ſeruants, they came at his call, & bowed

at his beck, euen the beaſts of the fielde, the fowles of the ayre, and the fiſhes of the ſea, he put all things in ſubiection vnder his feete: ſo that it forceth the Prophet to cry out, and with a lowde voyce to exclaime. O Lord how excellent is thy name, in all the worlde? what is man that thou art ſo mindefull of him? or the ſonne of man that thou ſo regardeſt him? thou madeſt him lower then the Angels to crowne him with glorie, and great worſhip, he wanted nothing that harte could wiſhe, he was placed in Paradiſe amongst all paſſing pleaſures. The ground of it ſelfe yeelded foorth her increaſe, without toyle or trauell. He was made Subiect to no creature, but was Lord of all (him onely excepted) who had ſo preferred him. This God, and this Lorde, for all theſe his graces and bleſſings vnſpeakable, required no great homage or ſeruice at his hand, he exacted no high rente, he did not ouer charge him: But only this (to ſhewe his ſoueraigne authoritie

ouer him) he gaue him a commaundement, no weightie thing to be obſerued, but a matter eaſily to be performed: to wit (that he hauing aboundance of al things beſide, he ſhould abſteyne (for his pleaſure) from taſting of the tree of good and euill: and all this he did, to trye his obedience. Marke now on the other ſide, this vnkinde creature: this vngratefull wretch, and wicked man, forgetting God, and what he had done for him, caſting all aſide behinde his backe, moſt traiterouſlye, villanouſly, and moſt lyke a monſter, rebels againſt his Lord, contemneth his Creator, and ſets his God at naught, & ſo liſtens to the deuill, beleeue his lyes, following lyke a beaſt his ſenſuall appetite: and euen in that one thing forbidden, ſpighteth his God, regardeth not his worde, feareth not Death that was threatned, but eateth of the forbidden tree, maugre the beard of God and his iudgements. See therefore the

greatneſſe of his ſinne, and the due deſerts of this euerlaſting death (which I ſpake of) could any puniſhment bee great enough, or any bitter plague bad enough for ſuch a haynous fact, that whereas God had giuen him ſuch libertie, and freedome of all things, he would not ſo much as obey him in one. Againe, God did not onely binde him to obey him, but threatned his diſobedience. If thou eate thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death. Notwithſtanding both Gods commaunding, and his threatning, he is moſt careleſſe, and ſwiftly runnes headlong to ſinne and wickedneſſe, and ſo entred into ſuch a maſſe of miſeries, whence neither he himſelfe, or his poſteritie, could euer vnwinde themſelues. For ſo abuſing his owne freewill, he loſt it, and was made a ſlaue vnto himſelfe: defacing Gods image, he became like vnto the diuell: and contemning life, he found out death, euen death erernall. This was the wages of

his ſinne, this was the hyer of his labour, this great profit reaped he for his paines. Marke nowe the fruite of his diſobedience: God thruſt him out of Paradiſe, and being extruded, kept him out by Cherubins, ſo he ſawe his owne ſhame, and could not couer his wickedneſſe: his Figge leaues would not ſerue his turne, but God accurſed him, and his ſeede: he plagued the earth with barrenneſſe, & made all creatures feele the ſmart of this fall: and as he diſobeyed God; ſo cauſed he diſobedience in the creatures towardes him. Hereof comes thefearceneſſe of Lions, Beares, Tygers, Wolues, and all wilde beaſts: hereof ariſed all rebellions, and warre, diſorder, ſcarcitie, dearth, hunger, cold, nakedneſſe, plagues, murther, and all kinde of miſeries that are in the world: all which, are fore-runners of this eternall death, and ringleaders to damnation. And to conuince vs of this our accurſed ſtate the better, God renewed

his law firſt written (as I ſaid) in nature: but blotted out by our fall, euen in tables of ſtone, to ſhew vs the hardneſſe of our hearts, that ſo (as in a glaſſe) we might ſee our owne condemnation. For amidſt the heapes of other ſinne, pride ſo poſſeſſed our hearts, that although we were nothing but ſinne: yet we thought our ſelues cleane, holy, and righteous. We were ſo blinded, that we knew not ſinne, vntill the law layd it open, & ſhewed vs our nakednes. Without the law (ſaith Paul) we had not knowen ſinne. I knew not (ſaith he) ſinne, but by the law: for I had not knowen luſt, except the law had ſayd, Thou ſhalt not luſt. But ſinne tooke an occaſiō by the cōmandement, & wrought in me al maner of concupiſence: for without the law, ſin is dead. Not as though there were no ſinne in the world before the publiſhing of the law (for euen the Gentiles them ſelues which had not the law written, ſhewed the effect of the law in their harts, their conſcience alſo bearing

witneſſe, and their thoughts accuſing one another, or excuſing) and therfore being conuinced of ſin in their ſoules without the lawe written, are a lawe vnto themſelues: and ſinning without the lawe, ſhall periſh without the law written, by the lawe of nature ingrafted in their hearts. This is prooued by many morrall vertues, that they naturally followed, and by many vices which they naturally hated. This knowledge of the lawe of nature (though vnperfect) yet ſufficient to confound them. Albeit ſinne indeed was then hidden in reſpect, and their beſt knowledge of the lawe ſo ouerſhadowed, and well nigh blotted, that ſinne could not appeare in his nature. But when the lawe was renued, ſinne (that ſeemed to be dead) reuiued, and ſhewed it ſelfe: all our ſpots did then appeare, which before were darkened, by ignorance of Gods lawe, which we gained by our fall. The lawe then conuinced vs of ſinne, & reuealed

our nakedneſſe, which our Fig leaues had hidden, it opened the inward man with all his concupiſcence, it ſhewed vs our ſhame and confuſion, our vgelſome ſhape, moſt monſtrous to behold, how wee were tranſformed from the Image of God, to the ſimilitude of the diuell: it put vs in remembrance of our deuine nature, which wee had loſt: it ſhewed vs hell and the wrath of God. Nothing but condemnation appeared by it: it let vs vnderſtand how farre we were falne from God, how all things both within vs and without vs, were corrupted: it painted out God in his nature, according to his moſt pure holineſſe and iuſtice: how he requireth all our heart, all our ſoule, all our mynde, all our might, all our ſtrength, all our force, in this his ſeruice. All our members, both head, handes, and heart (yea all partes that we poſſeſſe) are tyde to his obedience. The leaſt ſinne could not ſhadowe it ſelfe, but it ſhewed it in

vs, not condempning only our outward actes, but geuing ſentence againſt our wicked thoughtes: yea, all our idle motions, without conſent. And therefore ſince all fleſh (created of God) is corrupted: ſo that the verie imaginations of mans hart, are onely euill continually, ſince that by the Law it is co
                  ••
               inced, that there is none that doth good, no not one, but all are concluded vnder ſinne, and ſubiect to the ſame guilt of damnation. Since by the Law commeth the knowledge of ſinne, and that it ſtoppes euery mans mouth, and makes all the worlde ſubiect to Gods iudgementes, and ſummons them to appeare before his ſeate: ſince it was added, becauſe of tranſgreſſions, & that our ſinnes might more appeare and abound: therefore it is called (to the vnregenerat man) an importable yoke: the occaſion of ſinne, hence it is called the law of ſinne, and of wrath, the adminiſtration of condempnation, & the oldnes of the letter,

which can not giue life, but pronounceth all our workes accurſed.
            And here beholde the ſtrength and ſting of death. How did death enter? By ſinne. How did ſinne appeare? and what is the ſtrength of the ſame? The Law of God, which giueth ſentence of condempnation agaynſt all fleſh, and leaueth not one iuſtified in his ſight: And yet notwithſtanding all this, the Law of God is holy, iuſt, and good, opening his very will, ſetting a bleſſing before our eyes as well as a curſſe. It was not contrary to our nature before it was corrupted, but agreeable for the Image of man, in which he was firſt created. It teacheth the very patterne of true obedience, what is agreeable to God and his nature, how much he hateth ſinne, and delighteth in goodnes. It offereth both lyfe and death: lyfe to the obeyers, death to the breakers.
            Therefore let vs all glorifie God, let euery mans mouth be ſtopped from accuſing

him or his Law. Let vs confeſſe againſt our ſelues our ſinnes, and ſay vnto him: Shame and confuſion belonges vnto vs, Death and dampnation is our due: the heauie anger, wrath, and hell, are our deſartes: And thou O bleſſed God, art iuſt, righteous, good, and gratious, in all thy doinges for euer. Let vs thus (I ſay) giue ſentence againſt our ſelues, that God may be founde cleare (euen to the moſt wickedſt men) when he is iudged. Well then, let vs beare in minde that God is not too rigorous in puniſhing vs with eternall death, by reaſon of our ſinnes ſo conuinced by his lawe: and that Gods infinite iuſtice thus broken & diſobeyed, coulde not otherwyſe be anſwered of man, but by infinite ſuſteyning of eternall death.
            Marke therefore (I pray you) the whole kingdome of the Deuil▪ He firſt fighteth and warreth with temptations, which are as dartes to wounde our

ſoules to death▪ which if we reſiſt not, (being ſo tempted, but yeelde to ſinne) then comes the Law againſt vs with his force, and by vertue of the Law, death entreth and triumpheth. For the ſting of death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law: for it ſheweth vs Hel, which is the pallace of Death, & leaues vs in perdition. So that you ſee (according to my promiſe) what Death is it ſelfe, what Prince it hath, and what ſtrong Souldiers it hath to keepe his kingdome: to wit, the Deuill him ſelfe, ſinne, lawe, wrath of God, and all to vpholde it: Wherefore it is no maruel yf the remembraunce of death be bitter to many, and that they abhor and hate it. I ſay it is no wonder if all their ioyntes do tremble and ſhake a ſunder: for the horror thereof made the Sonne of God oft to pray againſt it, to ſweate droppes of bood for the agonie of it, and to cry out to his Father as a man forelorne. Why haſt thou forſaken mee?
               
Neither yet was this ſo ſtrange a miracle, to ſee the Sonne of God ſo amazed at death: for it ſet both Deuill, Lawe, Sinne, Hell, Graue, and wrath of God againſt him: all theſe were armed to ouerthrow him: all theſe were Death his Souldiers, and appoynted captaynes to conquer Chriſt. And any, or the leaſt of theſe without him, will quite deſtroy vs.
            But now (to your comfortes that beleeue) let vs ſee who got the victorie, whether Chriſt or Death, or which of them was ſpoyled: that ſo we may learne to confirme our fayth in the middeſt of our conflictes? You haue heard already what death is in it owne nature, & now heare what it is through Chriſt. Our eſtate without him we know: we are euen holden in the ſhadow of death, being fettered in our finnes. The weight of our finnes is the Law of God layde vpon vs. Hel is our priſon, & death is our Iaylor to hold vs.

See how we are locked from God: yet moſt iuſtly (as I noted.) In this diſtreſſe and deepe dungion, Ieſus Chriſt came to viſite vs, euen God and Man a right redeemer for vs: he takes our cauſe vppon him, and he reaſons and wraſtles with the Deuill, that helde vs captiues. This mightie Sauiour tooke fleſh and blood, to take our part, that he might deſtroy through death, him that had power of death, that is to ſay, the Deuil, and that he myght delyuer all them which for feare of death, were all their lyfe time ſubiect to bondage. He ſuffered for our ſinnes, the Iuſt for the vniuſt, that he might bring vs to God, and was put to death concerning the fleſh, but qui
                  •
               kened in the ſpirite, that he might be our ranſome.
            Marke therefore diligently (I beſeech you) this his combat and conflict. For, he had to deale with the Deuill, who helde vs captiues. The Deuill for his defence had the Law, euen the righteous

law of God: which man had tranſgreſſed, and therefore now worthely ſubiect to his power. The obiections therefore that he made againſt man to Chriſt, are theſe. Whoſoeuer breaketh the Law of God, ſhall die the death: but man hath broken the Law of God, therefore he ſhall die the death: and by the vertue of the Law (ſayth the Deuill) I will holde him in death. Againe, the Law of God is according to his nature good, holy, and righteous. And therfore the death of man pronounced by the Lawe, is iuſt, and his damnation righteous. God the Law giuer, is infinite and eternall: therefore his death muſt be endles and euerlaſting. God is iuſt, and can not denie himſelfe. He ſayd, that man (yf he ſhould breake his lawe) ſhould die the death: and therefore death ſhal hold him. God is perfect & pure: and therefore the ſatiſfaction muſt be according to his nature. His law bindes both ſoule and body, euen thought, worde, and

deede: and therefore let man performe this, and he ſhall liue. Theſe, and many more are the dartes of the Deuil, which he throweth agaynſt our foules to wound vs to death: the leaſt of which, aſſuredly will pearſe vs thorow, were it not that the ſtrength of Ieſus Chriſt rebounded them backe, and bluntens them. He is our ſheilde & our buckler, our helmet of ſaluation, our caſtle, and houſe of defence: he couereth vs with his winges, and we are ſafe vnder his feathers: his faithfulneſſe and his trueth doth ſtill preſerue vs. For all theſe dangerous dartes, and a thouſande more, are nothing to his power, their force is leſſe, and their violence is weaker then ſtraw or ſtubble to the furnace.
            Now therefore, marke now theſe darts are dasſhed. Gods iuſtice in deede was gon out, it could not be reuoked. Man muſt keepe his law, or man muſt die an eternall death. Hereupon it pleaſed Chriſt to become man for our

ſakes, and ſo as man, to ſatiſfie the Law of God for our ſinnes, that Gods trueth might not be altered. No Angell or Saint could be our ſauiour in this caſe, but man who had offended God. Now man of him ſelfe being too weake to beare this heauie burthen, Chriſt was God and man, that ſo he might ſuffer as man, and ſaue as God. Our mediatour was God and man. Man and God were foes: and therefore, being God and man, he reconciled man to God. And as the firſt Adam by tranſgreſſing, brought death vpon all: ſo the ſeconde Adam through obeying, brought life to all beleeuers. Gods pureſt iuſtice could not exact the thing which he fulfilled not: it required the fulfilling of the Law. This he accompliſhed, being the ende of the Law and the Prophets. He was the very ſubſtaunce of all the Ceremonies, and the body of all their ſhadowes of the Law. He was circumciſed, he payd tribute, he was obedient

in all thinges, and was vnder the Law: ſo that his comming was not to breake, but to fulfill the Law. It required perfect holineſſe in man: he therefore was a man without ſinne, conceaued by the holy ghoſt. And therefore he is not afrayde to ſay to the faces of his foes, Which of you can rebuke mee of ſinne? Yea, the Iudge him ſelfe that condemned him, waſhed his handes, as a witneſſe of his cleanneſſe, I finde no fault in this iuſt man. True therefore is the ſaying of the Apoſtle, That he was made ſinne for vs, that knew not ſinne, that we ſhould be made the righteouſneſſe of God through him. He is truely called the Paſcall Lambe, moſt pure and vnſpotted, that taketh away the ſinnes of the worlde. To him al the Prophetes beare witneſſe, that iuſtly through his name is preached the remiſſion of ſinnes, and that there is no other name vnder heauen by which we can be ſaued. Thus he fulfilled the law for man, being man him ſelfe: his obedience

was moſt perfect, he left nothing 
                  •
               nfulfilled. And as he kept the Law, which man had broken, ſo likewiſe he 
                  •
               id pay the penaltie for his traſgreſſion. The breach of the Law, was the curſſe of God, and eternall death: He there
               
                  •
               ore became accurſed, and ſuſteyned 
                  •
               eath, euen the death of the Croſſe, ac
               
                  •
               urſed of God: And ſo by death ouer
               
                  •
               ame death, & by this curſing brought he bleſſing of God vpon vs. He can

                  •

                  •
               nd made it voyde. So that now the 
                  •
               aythful may triumph through Chriſt. Death being ſwallowed vp in victorie, 
                  •
               hey may boldly excleayme and ſay▪ 
               O Death where is thy ſting? O Graue where 
                     •
                  s thy victorie? For the ſting of death be

                  •
               s no condemnation that now remayneth.

And therefore thankes be vnto God, who hath giuen vs the victorie through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. Fo
                  •
                he hath taken our ſinnes vppon his backe, he hath ſatisfied the Lawe o

            This exchange dyd he make for our ſakes. And therefore through him, by fayth (being dead in our ſinnes) we are reuiued, quickened, and ſtrengthened. All his merites are reputed vnto vs, as though they were our owne, and our ſinnes are truely his: for which he ſuffered and ſatisfied, to the vttermoſt. Chriſte is our onely Sacrifice, the fountayne of grace and vertue, the portion of our inheritance,

                lie togeather, the ſucking Chylde doth play vpon the hole of the Aſpe: yea▪ euen the weaned child moſt ſafely puts his hand into the caue of the Cockatrice: Chriſt hath now diſſolued the workes of the Deuill, and broken his ſnares a ſunder, that all beleeuing ſinners ſhould be made righteous by him, wayting for eternall lyfe. He hath opened the eyes of the blinde, and brough
                  •
                the priſoners from their dungion, and them that ſate in darknes, hath he placed

in light. To conclude, By his death and paſſion, he deſtroyed ſinne, and ſo was death in the ſame victory maymed. For ſinne is the ſting of death. And when death had loſt his ſting, & was conquered in Chriſts reſurrection from death; Satan alſo loſt his ſtrength and power, which reſted onely on them which through ſinne were in danger of death: For the wages of ſinne is death. Finally, becauſe hell only deuoureth them that through ſinne and death are ſlaues to Satan: It foloweth that the other three, were by him ſo mightely vanquiſhed, that hell alſo with all the danger thereof was ſubdued, and we deliuered from al their tirrany, according to the ſaying of Zacharie, He hath performed the oth which he ſware, to deliuer vs from our enemies, that we might ſerue him without feare. Now then, all we which beleeue, are freed from the ſlauerie of ſinne, kingdome of the deuill, gulfe of hell, and chaynes of death. So that hencefoorth

death is no death to Gods chyldren through Chriſt, but great aduantage: and appoynted for a paſſage to a better lyfe. And therefore though wicked reprobates tremble at the name of death, (to whom they are in thraldome) yet Gods chyldren (being conquerours through Chriſt) may well triumph: for now through him, we haue an entrance made to heauen, and death is the very doore to life, a paſſage out of this world to the Father, from the priſon of this body to goe to Chriſt. It is a returning to our heauenly countrey: from which we were exiled. And this is the cauſe why the godly ſigh and ſorrow, to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt, being ſubiect to ſinne. And heere let vs note, that whereas death is a diſſolution of the ſoule from the body: that therefore the body is nothing els but a priſon, in which our ſoules are bound. And he that deſireth to liue, is like a madde Priſoner, that is delighted in his giues,

that may be free from his fetters, and cares not: that may go out of the Iayle and will not. Wherefore we muſt conſider of Death, not as it ſeemes in it ſelfe, but as it is Chriſt, naturally we couet to be, and conſequently we ſhunne Death, which depriues vs of our being. Death is horrible to the beſt, for a while, becauſe it is repugnant to their nature: but on the other ſide, we ſee how we are held as in a priſon, ſo long as this body of ſinne compaſſeth vs about. Therefore wee ought to long for the euerlaſting life which is promiſed vs after death (for when wee drawe towards death, then come we nigh vnto it, and Death is the very gate of life) aſſuring our ſelues, that for aſmuch as Ieſus Chriſt hath paſſed the ſame way, we neede not be afraide that Death ſhall ouercome vs, for it is through him, a reba
                  •
               ed and blunted ſword, whoſe point is broken, whoſe edge is taken off, ſo that it cannot hurt vs: and although it

drawe ſome bloud of vs: yet notwithſtanding the ſame ſhall be but to purge vs, and rid vs of all our diſeaſes.
            Since therefore wee haue learned what Death is in it ſelfe, and what in Chriſt, and knowe the worſte: ſince Death is aduantage to the faithfull, and the very high waye to heauen: let vs learne how to prepare our ſelues there to, which is the laſt thing which I promiſed to performe.
            Firſt therefore in this our preparation, let vs arme our ſelues againſt theſe temptations, with which both diuell, world, and fleſh, will mightily aſſaile vs. What man (ſaith the deuill) wilt thou dye? why then, beholde the company of thy ſinnes, the wrath of God, the graue, and hell are ready to deuoure thee: the Law is thy Iudge which doth condemne thee. To theſe temptations of the deuill we muſt oppoſe Chriſtes righteouſneſſe, ſatiſfactions, and merits, in which God holdeth himſelfe fullye

appeaſed. The world it ſetteth abroche his baites. What, wilt thou dy (O man) why ſee thy goodly buildings, thy bags of golde, thy landes and liuings, thy rents and reuenues, thy paſtime and thy pleaſures, thy Iewels, and thy treaſures, thy delights, and all that thy heart deſireth. In deed, O worlde, this felicitie is good: but yet no otherwiſe then it ſtandeth with the fauour of God, it is to be kept; but yet ſo farre foorth, as by the keeping of it we looſe not God: and yet we ſee the vanitie of thy pleaſures, the frailtie of thy glory, and the fickleneſſe of thy goods, are therefore nothing in reſpect of the ioyes of heauen, and happy lyfe, which after death I am ſure to haue. Wherefore I deſire to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt: in whom, are hidden all the treaſures of God, who is the keeper of our life. For, this our life which now we lead, is no life in deed (but a death) for wee are dead, and our lyfe is hid with God in

Chriſt, we walke by faith, and not by ſight: yea, ſo long as we are at home in this our body, we wander and go aſtray from God our Lorde.
            And O thou worlde (which allureſt me ſo to loue this life) What is thy wages? If I ſhould ſerue thee, I am ſure to be a foe to Chriſt, who loues thee not, who prayeth not for thee, whoſe kingdome is not of thee: and therefore to loue thee, is to hate my God: which to doe, is worſe then death. Thy rewarde I knowe is nothing but nakedneſſe: for naked I came vnto thee, and naked I ſhall goe from thee. And therefore I am willing to forſake thee, and deſire to be loſed, and to be with Chriſt; who will couer my nakedneſſe with the robes of his righteouſneſſe: laſtlye comes the fleſh with trembling and quaking.
            And wilt thou die (O man?) why, ſee thy friends and thy family, thy wife and thy children, thy father, and thy mother

weepe and wayle, crye and call vnto thee, and wilte thou depart thus? wilte thou needs go from them? But O thou fleſh, fight not thus againſt my ſoule; it is good in deede to tarry ſtill amongſt our friends, yet ſo that wee abide not there in Gods diſpleaſure, and hereafter to dwell in hell with the diuels, in fyre euerlaſting. There is nothing vnder God, but it may be kept, ſo that God (being aboue all thinges which wee haue) be not loſt. He that loues, father or mother, wife or children, &c. better then Chriſt, is not worthy of his preſence. And therefore though they lament the loſſe of my life, yet can they not redeeme it: for what man is he that liueth, and ſhall not ſee death. And ſhall hedeliuer his ſoule from hell; No, no, neither riches, nor ſtrength, neither power, nor pollicie, can preuaile in this point: for whether we ſleepe, or whether we wake, we drawe towards death. God hath ſet vs our bounds, which we

cannot paſſe: and as the greene leaues in a thicke tree, ſome fall, and ſome growe: ſo is the generation of fleſhe and bloud, one commeth to his ende, and another is borne: wee came not altogether, neither muſt wee returne altogether.
            Therefore (O fleſh) be content. O my friends be quiet, for needes vvee muſt departe: yet to meete againe vvee are ſure. And in going from you (my fleſhly friends) I goe to the Saintes of heauen, to the mounte Sion, and to the cittie of the liuing God, the celeſtiall Ieruſalem, to the companie of innumerable Angels, to the aſſemblye and congregation of the firſt borne, and to God the Iudge of all, and to the ſpirites of iuſt and perfect men: I know that ſo long as I am in this fleſh, I cannot pleaſe God: and therefore I deſire to be loſed, and to be with Chriſt. We haue heere no continuing cittie, wee looke for one of God. And I know, if

this my earthly houſe of this tabernacle, be once deſtroyed: I ſhall haue a building giuen me of God, a houſe not made with handes, but eternall with God in heauen. Marke, our bodyes be earthly houſes: Dust thou art, and into dust thou ſhalt returne againe. They are as Innes, wherein wee ſoiourne for a ſeaſon: they are as tabernacles ſet vp for a time, and quicklye to be remooued: (being without foundation) our bodies are like an olde ruinous cottage, ſtill in danger to fall. Dauid counted himſelfe a ſtranger vpon the earth, and a ſoiournour, as all his fathers were.
            Hereof Abraham obeyed God, to go whither hee would: hee abode in the lande of Promiſe, as in a ſtrange countric, as one that dwelte in Tents. For hee looked for a cittie hauing a foundation, whoſe builder and maker is God. Iob called this our body a houſe of claye: therefore the godly grone in

this tabernacle (being loded with corruption) that this mortalitie may bee ſwallowed vp of lyfe: fleſh, and bloud cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen. Gods children therefore are greeued (not becauſe they beare about their bodies, (for it is a greefe to them to lay them downe) no, they ſigh for this, to be clenſed from their ſinnes. Wretched man that I am (ſaith Paul) who ſhall deliuer me from this bodye of ſinne. And therefore we ought not to long for this preſent lyfe, which indeed is but an Image of Death: but rather loathe it, that wee may bee vnloden of our ſinnes.
            This preparation to dye, perteyneth vnto all: for neither riche, nor poore: olde, nor yonge: Prince, nor people: Death lets eſcape. It reſpecteth no perſon, no ſexe, no age, no condition, no eſtate whatſoeuer, no power, no riches, no learning, no pollicie, can reſiſt it. There is no remedie for this ſickneſſe,

no phiſicke to be found againſt it. It is the way of all the worlde: it is an Axe that heweth downe, not onely the low ſhrubs and Oſiers, but alſo the great Elmes and Okes: yea, all the high and tall trees of Lebanon. The dayes of man are but as Graſſe, and as a flower of the fielde: in the morning it is greene, and flouriſheth: but in the euening it is cut downe, dryed vp, and withered. Wee bring our yeares to an end, as a tale that is tolde. Our life is like a ſtage, on which men play theyr partes, and paſſe away.
            Man is like a thing of naught, his dayes are lyke a ſhadowe. God biddeth Eſay to crye, that all fleſh is graſſe, and all the grace and goodlineſſe thereof, is but as a flower of the field. O that the Lorde would open the eyes of all, to ſee themſelues in this bright Glaſſe. What? are we all but graſſe? and ſhall we wither as Haye? alas wee cannot ſo perſwade our ſelues: for if we could,

it would plucke downe our pride, and ſet our loftie lookes aſide. It woulde then ſhorten ſoone our ruffes ſo long, and make our monſtrous attire more modeſt. It would mittigate our madneſſe, and make vs humble mynded: we would then throwe downe our ſelues with Abraham, and ſay to God, We are but duſt, and aſhes: this is a common caſe, that all fleſh is duſt. Now for auoyding extreame ſorrowe, (vvhich at the houre of death will mightily aſſayle vs) Let vs againſt that time bee euen with the vvorlde, at agreement with our brethren, & eſpecially with our owne conſcience, which then moſt ſtraightly will accuſe vs. The conſience is lyke a Chryſtall Glaſſe, wherein (if vve vvill) vvee may lyuely viewe our ſelues. It vvill ſhewe euery thing that is amiſſe in ſoule and body.
            Let vs therefore take our ſpundg in hand, to clenſe our ſpots: to wit, true faith in Chriſt, and good fruites that

followe it, that ſo being at one vvith the vvorlde, in charitie with our brethren, and cleane in our conſcience through Chriſt: vve may be ready to goe the waye of all the vvorlde. And that this our iourney may bee more eaſie, and this rough waye (as it ſeemeth to the fleſh) more plaine: let vs arme our ſelues with theſe contemplations vvhich ſhall followe; let vs ſaye vnto our ſoule: Why art thou ſo ſad, and why art thou ſo diſquieted within mee. Put thy truſt in God, which is the helpe of my countenance, and my God.
            Why ſhould a Chriſtian man ſo feare the force of Death, whoſe ſting is quite deſtroyed? Can Death depriue him of Chriſte, which is all his comforte, ioye, and lyfe? No, but Death ſhall delyuer him from this mortall bodye full of ſinne and wickedneſſe, which beateth downe the ſpirite. Faine would this fleſhe make

ſtrange of that which the ſpirite doth imbrace.
            O (ſaith a godly martyr) how lothe is this loytering ſluggard to paſſe forth, and goe forwarde in Gods pathe to heauen. So that were it not through the force of faith, plucking it forward: and the bridle of Gods moſt ſweete promiſes, and of hope pricking on behinde, great aduenture there were of fainting by the way. Who would bee ſorry to forſake this lyfe, which cannot but bee moſt certaine of eternall lyſe? Who loueth the ſhadowe better then the body? Who can loue this lyfe, but they that regarde not the life to come? Who can deſire the droſſe of this worlde, but ſuch as be ignorant of the treaſures of euerlaſting ioy in heauen? I meane, who is afraide to die, but ſuch as hope not to liue eternally.
            A greater token (next faith in Chriſt) there is not of our election, then not to ſtand in feare of Death, which lyke a

Tayler putteth off our ragges, and arayeth vs with the royall robes of immortallitie, incorruption, and glorye. Shall the brute beaſtes, and ſenceleſſe creatures (being ſubiect to vanitie) grone in their kinde for the redemption of the ſonnes of God (at what time they ſhall be freed from their ſlauerie, and ſhall wee, which are indued with reaſon (yea and aboue reaſon inlightened) with Gods holy ſpirite (eſpecially, when it ſtandeth vpon a ioyfull being, and euerlaſting dwelling with God in heauen) ſhall wee not, I ſay, lift vp our mindes beyond this rottenneſſe of earth.
            And therefore, that theſe thinges may pearce the deeper: let vs brieflye conſider (for a concluſion of all) what this lyfe is that we ſo loue: what death is that we ſo feare: and vvhat is prepared for vs after death, vvhich vvee ſo little regarde. Which three conſiderations (for the moſt part) I haue rather

partly collected out of others, then added of mine owne: for that they are ſo ready at hand, and fit for my purpoſe: yea and ſo exquiſite in themſelues, as that my paines ſhould be but ſuperfluous to trouble my ſelfe with ſtudying any further for this concluſion.
            Firſt therefore, concerning this life, you know it is full of miſery, vanitie, vexation and vvoe. It is a plaine exile from God: for if heauen be our countrie, vvhat is this earth, but a place of baniſhment?
            If the departing out of this vvorld, bee an entring into lyfe: vvhat is this worlde, but a graue wherein wee are buried? vvhat is it elſe but to bee drowned in Death? If to bee deliuered out of this body, is to be ſet at perfect libertie: what is this body elſe, but a priſon, a Iayle, and a dungeon? If to enioy the ſweete preſence of God, be the higheſt felicitie: why then, to bee kepte from it, is it not the extreameſt

miſerie? And certainlye till wee bee eſcaped out of this lyfe, vve vvander abrode from the Lorde.
            If vvee conſider, that this vnſtedfaſt, faultie, corruptible, frayle, wythering, and rotten Tabernacle of ourbodie, is therefore diſſoluted by Death, that it afterwardes maye bee reſtored againe, into a ſtedfaſt, perfect, vncorruptible, and heauenly glorye: ſhall not faith compell vs feruentlye to deſire that vvhich nature feareth? If we conſider that by Death vvee are called out of baniſhment, to inhabite our Countrey: yea, our heauenly countrey: ſhall vve obteyne no comforte thereby?
            Alas, this our vvretched lyfe, is a vapoure, a ſmoake, a ſhadowe, a warre-fare, a Wilderneſſe, a vayle of vvretchedneſſe: wherewith wee are compaſſed about on euerye ſide, vvith moſte fyerce and fearefull enemies.
            
               
And ſhould vve deſire to dwell heere? ſhould vvee luſt to lyue in this lotheſome and laborious lyfe? ſhould vvee vviſhe to tarry in this vvretchedneſſe? ſhould vve haue pleaſure to remaine in this perilous eſtate? Daniels Den is not ſo dreadfull, as is this dungeon vvee dwell in.
            Secondly, concerning death (as you haue partly heard) vvhat is it now elſe, then a Waſpe vvithout a ſting, a ſword without an edge, a dagger vvithout a pointe? What is it elſe now to all Gods children, then the diſpatcher of all diſpleaſures: the ende of all our trauels, the doore of heauen, the gate of gladneſſe, the porte of Paradiſe, the hauen of health, the rayle of reſt, the entrance of felicitie, the ende of all miſeryes, and the beginning of all bleſſedneſſe. It is the very bed of Downe (faieth a godly Father) and therfore vvell compared to a ſleepe for the dolefull bodies of Gods people to reſt in: out of the

which they ſhall ariſe and awake moſt freſh and luſtie, to lyfe euerlaſting. It is a paſſage to the father, a chariot to heauen, the Lordes meſſenger, a leader vnto Chriſt, a going to our home, a deliuerance from bondage and priſon, a demiſſion from warre, a ſecuritie from all ſorrowes, and a manumiſſion from all miſeries: So that the very Heathen in ſome places, did cauſe the day of their death to be celebrated with mirth, melodie, and minſtrelſie. And ſhall we, which are Chriſtians, be diſmaide at it: ſhould we be afrayde of it? Shoulde ſuch a friende as it is be vnwelcomed? ſhould the fouleneſſe of his face feare vs from his good conditions? ſhould the hardneſſe of his huske hinder vs from his ſweete curnell? ſhould the roughneſſe of the tyde, tye vs to the banke and ſhore? there to bee drowned, rather then the deſire of our home driue vs to goe aboard? ſhoulde the

hardneſſe of the ſaddle, ſet vs on our feete to perriſhe by the waye, rather then to leape vp, and endure the ſame a little, and ſo bee where wee woulde bee.
            Laſtlye, touching the lyfe prepared for vs after death: if I ſhould go about to expreſſe it, the more I ſhould ſo doe, the further I ſhould be from it. For the eye hath neuer ſeene, nor the eare heard, nor the heart of man can euer conceiue, the ioye, mirthe, melodye, pleaſure, power, wealth, riches, honour, beautie, fellowſhip, dainties, odours, glorye, wiſdome, knowledge, treaſures, ſecuritie, peace, quietneſſe, and eternall felicitie, which the faithfull ſhall haue, and enioye, worlde without ende: with God the Father, the Sonne, and the holye Ghoſt, with Angels and Arche-angels, Patriarches, and Prophets, with Apoſtels and Euangeliſts, the martyrs, and confeſſors, and

with all the Saintes of God in the Pallace of the Lorde, in heauen the kingdome of God, the glorye of the Father.
            O woe to the blyndneſſe of our eyes, that wee ſee not this: woe to the hardneſſe of our hearts, that feele not this: woe to the deafeneſſe of our eares, that heare not this in ſuch wiſe as wee ſhould doe: where through wee might bee ſo farre from fearing Death, that rather wee ſhould wiſhe it, crying with Simeon: Nowe let thy ſeruante departe in peace. And with Dauid: When ſhall I come and appeare before thee? Woe is me, that my babitation is thus prolonged.
            
            But alas, great is our vnbeliefe, full fainte and weake is our fayth: or elſe nighte and daye, teares and cryings ſhoulde bee our Breade and Drinke, whileſt it is ſayde vnto vs: Where is your God? We ſhould rather wiſh

to bee doore keepers in the houſe of the Lord, then to dwell in theſe vngodlye tents: for one daye in his courte, is better then a thouſand.
            It is a token of little loue to God, to be ſo lothe to goe vnto him when hee calleth. Heerein wee ought to lament the weakeneſſe of our faith: and ſeeing our neede, to prepare for remedye againſt the time of neede, and to begge of God his ayde, ſtrength, and comfotre, againſt the pinche: which vndoubtedly, (If wee aske with faith) we ſhall obteyne, and fynde his promiſe true.
            Thus to knitte vp all, (leaſt I ſhould ſeeme to tyre you) my promiſe (I truſt) in ſome ſorte is performed, touching this ſhorte diſcourſe: wherein I haue rather tyed my ſelfe to the matter, then my methode. I alwayes preferre the ſubſtance before the ſhadowe: and thus I commende you to the Lorde,

beſeeching him for Chriſtes ſake, to keep vs, ſoules and bodies to his kingdome and glorye: and to leade vs, order vs, and diſpoſe vs, as he will in all thinges, in all places, and for euer: that at the length we may come whither we would: that is, into his owne bleſſed preſence and fruition of immortallitye, with Chriſt and his Saints, worlde without ende.
            AMEN.
