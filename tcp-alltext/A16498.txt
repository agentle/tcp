            To the tune of new Rogero.
            
            
               By reading whereof, perceiue well you may,
               What trust is in friends, or in kinsefolke to stay.
            
            A Larke sometimes did breed,
            within a field of Corne:
            And had increase when as the graine
            was ready to be shorne.
            She wary of the time,
            and carefull for her nest:
            Debated wisely with her selfe,
            what thing to doo were best:
            For to abide the rage.
            of cruell Reapers hand:
            She knew it was to perilous,
            with safetie for to stand.
            And to dislodge

            (Not knowing whether to remooue)
            great harmes might hap thereby.
            Therefore she ment to stay,
            till force constraind to fleet,
            And in the while for to prouide,
            some other place as meete:
            The better to prouide,
            the purpose of her minde:
            She would forthwith go seeke abroad,
            and leaue her young behinde:
            But first she had them all,
            attend their mothers will:
            Which carefull was for to eschew,
            each likelihood of ill.
            This Corne is ripe (quoth she)

            might cause our mortall care.
            Therefore to fence with skill,

            I will prouide some other place,
            for feare of after clappes.

            The prime and eldest Byrde,
            (thus cheeki) began to say:

            The owner of the plot,
            came hither with his Sonne:
            And said to him, this Wheat must down,

            Go get thee to my Friends.
            and bid them come to morne:
            And tell them that I craue their helpes,
            to reape a peece of Corne.
            The Larke that was the Dam,
            stood in a dumpe a while:

            The young assured by her,
            that such an oth did sweare:
            Did passe the time in wanted sléepe,
            and banisht former feare:
            And when the drousie night,
            was fled from gladsome day:
            She bad them wakē and looke about,
            for she must go her way.
            And said I warant you,
            these friends will not come heere:
            Yet notwithstanding listen wel,

            to helpe me with this geare.

            But when she heard of kin,
            she laughing cried amaine:
            A pin for kin, a figge for friends,
            yet kinne the worst of twaine.
            This man himselfe is poore,
