            THAT THOSE WHICH ARE of the Romane Religion in this Kingdome, may and ought to take the Oath of Allegeance.

            TO THE HIGH AND Mightie Prince IAMES, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britaine, France and Ireland, defender of the FAITH.

               AS Temporall armies consist of Press'd men, and voluntaries, so doe they also in this warfare, in which your Maiestie hath appear'd by your Bookes. And not only your strong and full Garisons, which are your Cleargie, and your Vniuersities, but also ob

Subiects haue in the cause (all being equally endanger'd in your dangers) giues euery one of vs a Title to the Dignitie of this warfare; And so makes tho
                  •
               e, whom the Ciuill Lawes made opposite, all one, Paganos, Milites. Besides, since in this Battaile, your Maiestie, by your Bookes, is gone in Person out of the Kingdome, who can bee exempt from waiting vpon you in such an expedition? For this Oath must worke vpon vs all; and as it must draw from the Papists a profession, so it must from vs, a Confirmation of our Obedience; They must testifie an Alleageance by the Oath, we, an Alleageance to it. For, since in prouiding for your Maiesties securitie, the Oath defends vs, it is reason, that wee defend it. The strongest Castle that is, cannot defend the Inhabitants, if they sleepe, or neglect the defence of that, which defends them; No more can this Oath, though framed withall aduantagious Christianly wisedome,

secure your Maiestie, and vs in you, if by our negligence wee should open it, either to the aduersaries Batteries, or to his vnderminings.
            The influence of those your Maiesties Bookes, as the Sunne, which penetrates all corners, hath wrought vppon me, and drawen vp, and exhaled from my poore Meditations, these discourses: Which, with all reuerence and deuotion, I present to your Maiestie, who in this also haue the power and office of the Sunne, that those things which you exhale, you may at your pleasure dissipate, and annull; or suffer them to fall downe againe, as a wholesome and fruitfull dew, vpon your Church & Commonwealth. Of my boldnesse in this addresse, I most humbly beseech your Maiestie, to admit this excuse, that hauing obserued, how much your Maiestie had vouchsafed to descend to a conuersation with your Subiects, by way of your Bookes, I also conceiu'd

an ambition, of ascending to your presence, by the same way, and of participating, by this meanes, their happinesse, of whome, that saying of the Queene of Sheba, may bee vsu

                  •
                For, in this, I make account, that I haue performed a duetie, by expressing in an exterior, and (by your Maiesties permission) a publicke Act, the same desire, which God heares in my daily prayers, That your Maiestie may very long gouerne vs in your Person, and euer, in your Race and Progenie.
            
               Your Maiesties most humble and loyall Subiect: IOHN DONNE.
               
            
         
         
            
            A TABLE OF THE CHAPTERS handled in this Booke.
            
               CHAP. I.
               OF Martyrdome and the dignity thereof.
               CHAP. II.
               That there may be an inordinate and corrupt affectation of Martyrdome.
               CHAP. III.
               That the Roman Religion doth by many erroneous doctrines mis-encourage and excite men to this vitious affectation of danger: first by inciting secular Magistracy: Secondly by extolling the value of Merites, and of this worke in special, by which the treasure of the Church is so much aduanced: And lastly, by the doctrin of Purgatory, which by this act is said certainly to be escaped.
               CHAP. IIII.
               That in the Romane Church the Iesuits exceed all others, in their Constitutions and practise, in all those points, which beget or cherish this corrupt desire of false-Martyrdome.
               CHAP. V.
               That the Missions of the Pope, vnder Obedience whereof they pretend that they come into this Kingdome, can be no warrant, since there are laws established to the contrary, to giue them, or those which harbor them, the comfort of Martyredome.
               CHAP. VI.
               A Comparison of the Obedience due to Princes, with the seuerall Obediences required and exhibited in the Romane Church: First, of that blinde Obedience and stupiditie, which Regular men vow to their Superiours: Secondly, of that vsurped Obedience to which they pretend by reason of o
                     •
                  r Baptisme, wherin we are said to haue made an implicite surrender of our selues, and all that we haue, to the church: and thirdly, of that obedience, which the Iesuits by a fourth Supernumerary vow make to be disposed at the Popes absolute will.
               CHAP. VII.
               That if the meere execution of the function of Priests in this Kingdome, and of giuing to the Catholiques in this land, spiritual sustentation, did assure their consciences, that to dye for that were martyrdome: yet the refusall of the Oath of Alleageance doth corrupt and vitiate the integrity of the whole act, and dispoile them of their former interest and Title to Martyrdome.
               CHAP. VIII.
               That there hath beene as yet no fundamental and safe ground giuen, vpon which

those which haue the faculties to heare Confessions, should informe their owne Consciences, or instruct their Penitents: that they are bound to aduenture the heauy and capitall penalties of this law, for refusall of this Oath. And that if any man haue receiued a scruple against this Oath, which he cannot depose and cast off, the Rules of their own Casuists, as this case stands, incline, and warrant them, to the taking therof.
               CHAP. IX.
               That the authority which is imagined to be in the Pope, as he is spiritual Prince of the monarchy of the Church, cannot lay this Obligation vpon their Consciences: First because the Doctrine it selfe is not certaine, nor presented as matter of faith: Secondly because the way by which it is conueyed to them, is suspitious and dangerous, being but by Cardinall Bellarmine, who is various in himselfe, and reproued by other Catholiques of equall dignity, and estimation.
               CHAP. X.
               That the Canons can giue them no warrant, to aduenture these dangers, for this refusall: And that the Reuerend name of Canons, is falsly and cautelously insinuated, and stolne vpon the whole body of the Canon law, with a breefe Consideration vpon all the bookes thereof: and a particular suruay, of all those Canons, which are ordinarily cyted by those Authours, which maint
                     •
                  ine this temporall Iurisdiction in the Pope.
               CHAP. XI.
               That the two Breues of Paulus the fift, cannot giue this assurance to this Conscience; First, for the generall infirmities, to which all Rescripts of Popes are obnoxious: And then for certaine insufficiencies in these.
               CHAP. XII.
               That nothing requir'd in this Oath, violates the Popes spirituall Iurisdiction; And that the clauses of swearing that Doctrine to bee Hereticall, is no vsurping vpon his spirituall right, either by preiudicating his future definition, or offending any former Decree.
               CHAP. XIII.
               That all which his Maiesty requires by this Oath, is exhibited to the Kings of Fraunce, And not by vertue of any Indult, or Concordate, but by the inhaerent right of the Crowne.
               CHAP. XIIII.
               Lastly, That no pretence, eyther of Conuersion at first, Assistance in the Conquest, or Acceptation of any Surrender from any of our Kings, can giue the Pope any more right ouer the Kingdome of England, then ouer any other free State whatsoeuer.
            
         
         
            
            AN ADVERTISEMENT TO the Reader.
            
               THough I purposed not to speake any thing to the Reader, otherwise then by way of Epilogue in the end of the Booke, both because I esteemed that to be the fittest place, to giue my Reasons, why I respited the handling of the two last Chapters, till another time, and also, because I thought not that any man might well and properly be called a Reader, till he were come to the end of the Booke: yet, because both he, and I, may suffer some disaduantages, if he should not be fore-possessed, and warned in some things, I haue changed my purpose in that point.
            For his owne good therefore (in which I am also interessed) I must first intreat him, that he will be pleased, before hee reade, to amend with his pen, some of the most important errors, which are hereafter noted to haue passed in the printing. Because in the Reading, he will not perchance suspect nor spy them, and so he may runne a danger, of being either deceiued, or scandalized.
            And for my selfe, (because I haue already receiued some light, that some of the Romane profession, hauing onely seene the Heads and Grounds handled in this Booke, haue traduced me, as an impious and profane vnder-valewer of Martyrdome,) I most humbly beseech him, (till the reading of the Booke, may guide his Reason) to beleeue, that I haue a iust and Christianly estimation, and reuerence, of that deuout and acceptable Sacrifice of our lifes, for the glory of our blessed Sauiour. For, as my fortune hath neuer beene so flattering nor abundant, as should make this present life sweet and precious to me, as I am a Moral man: so, as I am a Christian, I haue beene euer kept awake in a meditation of Martyrdome, by being deriued from such a stocke and race, as, I beleeue, no family, (which is not of farre larger extent, and greater branches,) hath endured and suffered more in their persons and fortunes, for obeying the Teachers of Romane Doctrine, then it hath done. I did not therefore enter into this, as a carnall or ouer-indulgent fauourer of this life, but out

of such reasons, as may arise to his knowledge, who shall be pleased to read the whole worke.
            In which, I haue abstained from handling the two last Chapters vpon diuers reasons; whereof one is, that these Heads hauing beene caried about, many moneths, and thereby quarrelled by some, and desired by others, I was willing to giue the Booke a hasty dispatch, that it might cost no man much time, either in expecting before it came, or in reading, when it was come.
            But a more principall reason was, that since the two last Chapters depend vpon one another, and haue a mutuall Relation, I was not willing to vndertake one, till I might perseuere through both. And from the last chapter it became me to abstaine, till I might vnderstand their purposes, who were formerly engaged in the same businesse. For the first Discouerie giues some title to the place, and secludes others, without the Discouerers permission; And in men tender and iealous of their Honour, it is sometimes accounted as much iniurie to assist, as to assault.
            When therefore I considered, that the most Reuerend and learned Sir Edward Coke, Lord chiefe Iustice of the cōmon Pleas (whom, they which are too narrow to comprehend him, may finde arguments enow to loue, and admire, out of the measure and proportion of his malice who hath written agains
                  •
                him, (since wee ought to loue h
                  •
               m so much, as such men hate him) had in this point of Iurisdiction, laid so solid foundations, raised so strong walls, & perfited his house vpon so sure a Rocke, as the lawes of this Kingdome are. And when I saw, that as the diuell himselfe is busiest to attempt them, who abound in strength of Grace, (not forbearing our Sauiour himselfe) so an ordinary Instrument of his, (whose continuall libels, and Incitatorie bookes, haue occasioned more afflictions, and drawne more of that bloud, which they call Catholique, in this Kingdome, then all our Acts of Parliament haue done,) had oppugned his Lordships Booke, and iterated and inconculcated those his oppositions, I could not know whether his Lordship reserued any farther consideration of that matter to his owne leasures, or had honoured any other man, with his commandement, or allowance to pursue it. Till therefore I might know, whether any such were embarqued therein, as would either accept my Notes, and dignifie them with their stile, or submit their Notes to my method, and the poore apparell of my language, or vndertake it entirely, or quit it absolutely, as a body perfit already, by that forme which his Lordship hath giuen it, I chose to forbeare the handling thereof at this time.
            One thing more I was willing the Reader should be forewarned

of; which is, that when he findes in the printing of this Booke oftentimes a change of the Character, hee must not thinke that all those words or sentences so distinguished, are cited from other Authors; for I haue done it sometimes, onely to draw his eye, and vnderstanding more intensly vpon that place, and so make deeper impressions thereof.
            And in those places which are cited from other Authors (which hee shall know by the Margine) I doe not alwayes precisely and superstitiously binde my selfe to the words of the Authors; which was impossible to me, both because sometimes I collect their sense, and expresse their Arguments or their opinions, and the Resultance of a whole leafe, in two or three lines, and some few times, I cite some of their Catholique Authors, out of their owne fellowes, who had vsed the same fashion of collecting their sense, without precise binding themselues to All, or onely their words. This is the comfort which my conscience hath, and the assurance which I can giue the Reader, that I haue no where made any Author, speake more or lesse, in sense, then hee intended, to that purpose, for which I cite him. If any of their owne fellowes from whom I cite them, haue dealt otherwise, I cannot be wounded but through their sides. So that I hope either mine Innocence, or their own fellowes guiltinesse, shall defend me, from the curious malice of those men, who in this sickly decay, and declining of their cause, can spy out falsifyings in euery citation: as in a iealous, and obnoxious state, a Decipherer can pick out Plots, and Treason, in any familiar letter which is intercepted.
            And thus much it seemed necessary to mee, to let the Reader know, to whose charitable and fauourable opinion
                  •
                I commit the booke, and my selfe to his Christianly and deuout Prayers.
         
         
            
            Those literall and punctuall Errors, which doe not much endanger the sense, I haue left to the discretion and fauour of the Reader, as he shall meete with them. The rest he may be pleased to mend thus.

            A PREFACE TO The PRIESTES, and IESVITS, and to their Disciples in this KINGDOME.
            
               I Am so well acquainted with the phrases of Diminution and Disparagement, and other personall aspersions, which your writers cast, and imprint vpon such of your owne side, as depart from their opinions in the least dramme or scruple; as I cannot hope that any of them will spare me, who am further remoued from them: For since Cassander, whom the two Emperour
                  •
                
               Ferdinand and Maximilian consulted, and called to them; not in any schisme betweene the Emperours and Popes, about temporall Iurisdiction: in which quarrell, whensoeuer it happened, the Emperours cause was euer sustained by as learned, and as Religious, and as many men, as the Popes, but in matters of

Doctrine, and for a way of Reformation, when the Popes themselues confessed, that the Church was in extreame neede thereof:

                Since hee (I say) is called by one of them but a Grammarian (to which honour, if he, which cals him so in scorne, had beene arriued, he would neuer haue translated vindiciae contra Tyrannos, reuenge vpon Tyrants, since vindiciae signifies a Decree or Order of the Iudge, in a cause of Bondage and Liberty depending before him, by which it is ordered, that the party whose condition is in question, shall remaine either free or bond, till the matter be heard without any preiudice, if it fall out otherwise vpon the hearing:) And since of Caietane (when hee differs from them in the point of the Canon of scriptures) they say,Idem. c. 1. n. 11 &. c. 5. n. 30. 
               That though he were well seene in Scholastique subtilties,

                since (because he denies marriage to be proued a Sacrament out of one place of Saint Paul) they say that he fell into grieuous errors in both Testaments, Hebraizando and Erasmizando: Since, when he distasts the coursenesse of the vulgar edition,

                they say, that in three or foure pages of his Psalter, there are more Barbarismes and Solaecismes then in the whole vulgar Bible: Since Erasmus (following the opinion of Driedo and other Catholickes, and so denying some part of Daniel to be Canonicall) is called by Bellarmine a Halfe-Christian,
                  De verbo. Dei l. 1. c. 9.
                these men will certainely be more rigid and seuere vpon me.
            
               2 And if they will be content to impute to me all

humane infirmities, they shall neede to faine nothing: I am, I confesse, obnoxious enough. My naturall impatience not to digge painefully in deepe, and stony, and sullen learnings: My Indulgence to my freedome and libertie, as in all other indifferent things, so in my studies also, not to betroth or enthral my selfe, to any one science, which should possesse or denominate me: My easines, to affoord a sweete and gentle Interpretation, to all professors of Christian Religion, if they shake not the Foundation, wherein I haue in my ordinary Communication and familiar writings, often expressed and declared my selfe: hath opened me enough to their malice, and put me into their danger, and giuen them aduantage to impute to me, whatsoeuer such degrees of lazines, of liberty, of irresolution, can produce.
            3 But if either they will transferre my personall weakenesses vpon the cause, or extend the faults of my person to my minde, or to her purest part, my conscience: If they will calumniate this poore and innocent worke of mine, as if it were written, either for Ostentation of any ability or faculty in my selfe; or for Prouocation, to draw them to an aunswere, and so continue a Booke-warre; or for Flattery to the present State; which, thogh my seruices be by many iust titles due to it, needs it not; or for exasperation, to draw out the ciuill sword in causes, which haue some pretence and colour of being spirituall; or to get Occasion hereby to vncouer the nakednes, and lay open the incommodious and vndefensible sentences and opinions, of diuers seuerall Authors in that Church; or to maintaine and further a scisme and

diuision amongst you, in this point of the Popes pretence to temporall iurisdiction: I haue no other shelter against these imputations, but an appeale to our blessed Sauiour, and a protestation before his face, that my principall and direct scope and purpose herein, is the vnity and peace of his Church. For as when the roofe of the Temple rent asunder, not long after followed the ruine of the foundation it selfe: So if these two principall beames and Toppe-rafters, the Prince and the Priest, rent asunder, the whole frame and Foundation of Christian Religion will be shaked. And if we distinguish not between Articles of faith & iurisdiction, but account all those super-edifications and furnitures, and ornaments which God hath affoorded to his Church, for exteriour gouernment, to be equally the Foundation it selfe, there can bee no Church; as there could be no body of a man, if it were all eye.
            
               4 They who haue descended so lowe, as to take knowledge of me, and to admit me into their consideration, know well that I vsed no inordinate hast, nor precipitation in binding my conscience to any locall Religion. I had a longer worke to doe then many other men; for I was first to blot out, certaine impressions of the Romane religion, and to wrastle both against the examples and against the reasons, by which some hold was taken; and some anticipations early layde vpon my conscience, both by Persons who by nature had a power and superiority ouer my will, and others who by their learning and good life, seem'd to me iustly to claime an interest for the guiding, and rectifying of mine vnderstanding in these

matters. And although I apprehended well enough, that this irresolution not onely retarded my fortune, but also bred some scandall, and endangered my spirituall re
                  •
               putation, by laying me open to many mis-interpretations; yet all these respects did not transport me to any violent and sudden determination, till I had, to the measure of my poore wit and iudgement, suruayed and digested the whole body of Diuinity, controuerted betweene ours and the Romane Church. In which search and disquisition, that God, which awakened me then, and hath neuer forsaken me in that industry, as he is the Authour of that purpose, so is he a witnes of this protestation; that I behaued my selfe, and proceeded therin with humility, and diffidence in my selfe; and by that, which by his grace, I tooke to be the ordinary meanes, which is frequent praier
                  •
                and equall and indifferent affections.
            
               5 And this course held in rectifying and reducing mine vnderstanding and iudgment, might iustifie & excuse my forwardnes; if I shold seeme to any to haue intruded and vsurped the office of others, in writing of Diuinity and spirituall points, hauing no ordinary calling to that function. For, to haue alwaies abstained from this declaration of my selfe, had beene to betray, and to abandon, and prostitute my good name to their misconceiuings and imputations; who thinke presently, that hee hath no Religion, which dares not call his Religion by some newer name then Christian. And then, for my writing in Diuinity, though no professed Diuine; all Ages, all Nations, all Religions, euen yours, which is the most couetous and lothest to diuide, or communicate with

the Layety, any of the honours reserued to the Clergie, affoord me abundantly examples, and authorities for such an vndertaking.

And as his Maiestie in his Kingdomes, is Religiously and prudently watchfull, to preserue that Crowne, which his Predecessors had redeemed from the rust, and drosse, wherewith forraine vsurpation had infected it; so is it easie to be obserued, that all the other Princes of Christendome, beginne to shake off those fetters, which

insensibly and drowsily they had admitted; and labour by all waies, which are as yet possible to them, to returne to their naturall Supremacy and Iurisdiction: which besides many other pregnant euidences, appeares by Ba

And this must of necessity be vnderstood of Countries, which professe the Romane Religion, because such as are Apostoliquely reformed, or are in that way, haue shut vp all waies of Appellations to Rome, or remedies from thence.

               that he is the only Prince, who bends all the sinewes of his power, and all the thoughts of his minde, not only to oppresse barbarous enemies of Christianity, but to containe christian Kings in their duetie: This Kingdome (I say) hath by all meanes, which it can, expressed how weary it is of that iurisdiction which the Pope exerciseth there, in these points which we complaine of: though the Popes haue euer beene most readie to recompence these temporall detriments to those kings; as the Donations of the Indyes, and of the Kingdome of Nauarre, and of England, testifie at full.

And after this, when the King had proceeded farther therein, and Antonie was proclaimed, and that a Legate came into Spaine, and offred there, in the name of the Pope, to be a Iudge betweene all pretenders, though Philip did not doubt the Legates inclination to his part, because he came into his Countrey to make the offer, and though he had more vse of such a seruice then, then before, yet he abstaind from vsing him therein, because hee thought that the Pope, vnder colour of doing the Office of a common father, went about to make himselfe absolute Iudge of Kingdomes; and besides the extraordinarie Authority, which he endeuoured to draw to his Sea,

               The Booke issued frō the very Chaire of S. Peter, by the commandement of S. Peter, and is confirmed by S. Peter, and shal without doubt endure for euer. And he addes this Commination, speaking to the King, Let them which resist these writings take heede, least they stumble, In hanc Petram, and least they bee vtterly trode in pieces, Ab ipsa, ab alto ruente Petra. But of Baronius his detestation of Monarchie, and ill behauiour towards all Kings, as well as his owne Soueraigne, I haue another occasion to speake. All which I purpose to euict here, was, that if Parsons haue spoken so heretically, in saying, that this is done by vertue of the Popes Indult; that remaines true, which I said before, that that Kingdome of Spaine, endeuours by all wayes it can, to redeeme it-selfe from these vsurpation

to build him a great Monastery, & to bring Aqueducts, and other conueniencies therunto, for his temporal prouision: so after the Pope hath passed ouer that little cost which he is at, to feede you a few yeares, you are euer after his instruments, to build vp his spirituall Monarchy to the ruine of all others, and your selues must ciment and morter the wals with your blood.

For the implicite faith, and blinde assent, which you were vsed heretofore to giue to the spirituall supremacy, was put vpon you, as Annibal,

But this doctrine of temporall Iurisdiction, is not onely a violent and dispatching poyson, but it is of the nature of those poysons, which destroy not by heat nor cold, nor corrosion, nor any other discerneable quality, but (as physitians say) out of the specifique forme, and

secret malignity, and out of the whole substance. For as no Artist can finde out, how this malignant strength growes in that poyson, nor how it workes, So can none of your Writers tell, how this temporall Iurisdiction got into the Pope, or how he executes it, but are anguished and tortured, when they come to talke of it, as Physitians and Naturalists are, when they speake of these specifique poysons, or of the cause and origen thereof, which is, Antipathie.

And though it might seeme vnseasonable, by any sharper meanes to haue wrastled or contended with them at beginning, because euerie sudden remoue, euen into a better ayre, is vnwholsome, and the worse, the purer the aire is; yet now it is time to worke vpon you, being of better experience, since you may haue obserued the birth and prosperous growth of this Reformation; and seene, that though diseases affect and corrupt suddenly and violently, and the cures thereof are orderly and long in accomplishing; yet this Reformation spent lesse time then the corruption, and the Church hath recouered more health in one age, then she had lost in a

O what spirituall Calenture possesses you, to make this hard shift to destroy your selues? If you be fishers of men, why dooth hee which sends you, first raise stormes and tempests of Treason, and scandall; and expose you to a certaine shipwracke?

                But as he which died of the bite of a Weasell, lamented because it was not a Lyon: So consider, it is not the Catholicke faith, which you smart for, but an vniust vsurpation, and that it is not the Lyon of Iuda, for whose seruice and honour your liues were well giuen, but it is for a Weasell, which crept in at a litle hole, and since is growne so full and pamperd, that men will rather die, then beleeue that he got in at so little an entrance.

For as the angrie eye of the first sort slew some: So doe the comminations and terrors of these Breues, thrust some of you into these dangers. And as, if the men of the second sort (whereof there were whole families in Afrique) did but commend Trees, Corne, Cattell, or Children, they prosperd no farther, but perish'd presently: So, after

               26 From you also haue come the subtill whisperings of Rebellious doctrines, the frequent and personall Trayterous practises, the intestine Commotions, and the publique and foraine Hostile attempts, in which, as we can attribute our deliuerance to none but God, so we can impute the malignitie thereof originally, to none but the deuill. Whose instruments the Iesuites (as we in our

iust warres haue giuen ouer long bowes for Artillerie) being men of rounder dispatch, then the Church had before, impatient of the long Circuit and Litigiousnes of excommunications, haue attempted a readier waie: and as the inuention of Gun-powder is attributed to a contemplatiue Monke; so these practique Monkes thought it belonged to them, to put it into vse and execution, to the destruction of a State and a Church; through which nimblenesse and dangerous actiuitie, they haue corrupted the two noble Inuentions of these later ages, Printing and Artillery by filling the world with their Libels, and Massacres.
            
               27 It becomes not me to say, that the Romane Religion begets Treason; but I may say, that within one generation it degenerates into it: for if the temporall iuris

                But as Erasmus said of that Church in his time, Syllogismi nunc sustinent Ecclesiam, wee may iustlie say, that this Doctrine of temporall Iurisdiction, is sustained but by Syllogismes, and those weake, and impotent, and deceiueable. And as it cannot appeare out of all the Authors, which speake of Saint Peters remaining at Rome, whether his body be there, or onely his ashes: So can it not be cleare to you, that the body of Christian Religion is there, since it is oppressed with such heapes of ashes, and dead Doctrine, as this of temporall Iurisdiction; so that diuers other Churches, which perchance were kindled at that, may burne more clearely and feruently,

If your owne iust and due preseruation, worke nothing vpon you, yet haue some pitie and compassion towards your Countrey,

               30 And haue some pitie and compassion (though you neglect your particulars) vpon that cause, which you call the Catholicke cause: Since, as we say of Agues, that no man dies by an Ague, nor without an Ague: So at Executions for Treasons, we may iustly say, No man dies for the Romane Religion, nor without it. Such a naturall consequence, or at least vnluckie concomitance they haue together, that so many examples will at last build vp a Rule, which a few exceptions, and instances to the contrarie will not destroy.

               9 How soone God beganne to call vpon man for this seruice, by sealing his acceptation of Abels sacrifice, in accepting Abel for a Sacrifice: for so saith Chrysostome, Abel, in the beginning, before any example, first of all Dedicated Martyredome.
                  
                     De Martyri Serm. 7. And as soone as Christ came into the world, after he receiued the oblations of the kings, presenting part of their temporall fortunes; the next thing wherein he would be glorified, was that Holocaust and Hecatombe of the innocent children, martyrd for his name.
               10 And though wee cannot by infinite degrees, attaine to our patterne Christ, the generall Sacrifice; yet we must exceed those Typique times, and Sacrifices of the old law; and be no more couetous of our selues, then they were of their beasts,

when that Sacrifice is required at our hands: for when we sacrifice our concupiscences, by rooting them out we equall them, who sacrificed their beasts; but we exceede them, when we immolate our soule and body to God.
               11 The blood of the Martyres was the milke which nourished the Primitiue Church, in her infancy, and shall it be too hard for our digestion now? It was the seede of the Church, out of which we sprung; and shall wee grudge to Tithe our selues to God, in any proportion that hee will accept? As Zipporah said to Moses,
                  
                     Exod. 4, 25 
                  vere sponsus sanguinum es mihi; the Church may well say to Christ, who lookes for this Circumcision at her hands, and this tribute of blood, which he hath so well deser

in doing that honour to that signe, which those first times needed: So is the treasure and crowne of Martyredome seposed for them, who take vp deuoutly the crosses of this life, whether of pouerty, or anguish'd consciences, or obedience of lawes which seeme burdenous, and distastefull to them; for all that time a man serues for his freedome, and God keeps his reckoning, from the inchoation of his Martyredome, which was from his first submission to these tribulations: which Chrysostome testifies thus;
                     Homil. in psal. 95. 
                  That when one is executed, he is then made a Martyr (that is, declared and accepted 
                     •
                  or a Martyre by the Church) but from that time, when he begunne to shewe, that he would professe that Religion, he was a Martyre, though he endured not that which Martyres doe.

               CHAP. II. That there may be an inordinate and corrupt affectation of Martyrdome.
               
                  THe externall honours, by which the  memories of the Orthodox Martyres in the Primitiue Church were celebrated and enobled, (as styling their deaths Natalitia, obseruing their Anniuersaries, commemorating them at their Altars, and instituting Notaries, to register their actions and passions) inflamed the Heretiques also to an ambition of getting the like glory. And thereupon they did not onely expose and precipitate themselues into

                     •
                  ch enraged and transported, that some of them taught,
                     Alfons. Castr. ver. Martyrium
                   That vpon conscience of sinne to kill ones selfe, was by this acte of Iustice, a Martyrdome

                   vpon which ground Petilian, against whom Saint Augustine writes, canonized Iudas for a
                     Prateolus l. 3 cap. 19. Martyre. The rage and fury of the Circumcelliones, in extorting this imagined Martyrdome; brought them first to solicite and importune others to kill

them; and if they fail'd in that suite, they did it themselues. And another Sect prospered so farre in heaping vp numbers of Martyres,

               2 And a zealous scorne to be ouertaken, and 
                     •
                  qual'd in this honor, prouoked sometimes those who write the Actes of the Orthodoxe Martyrs, to insert into their Histories some particulars which were not true, and some which were not iustifiable:
                     Cap. 2 for of the first sort of these insertions, which proceeded (as he saith) out of too much loue to the Martyrs, Baronius in his Martyrologe complaines;
                     Dist. 15. Sancta Romana
                   and by the Canon which forbids these Histories to be reade publiquely in the Romane Church, it seems they were careful that the people should not thereby be taught and encouraged, to bring such actions into consequence and imitation, as, (if the immediate instinct of Gods spirit, did not iustifie them) would seeme indiscreete and intemperate. Nor were they onely, which corrupted the stories in fault, but out of Binius, the last compiler of the Councels, we may perceiue, that euen they which were Orthodoxe pro
                     •
                  essors, had some tincture of this ouer-vehement affectation of Martyredome: for he saies, that the sixeteth Canon of the Eliberitane councell (by which it is enacted,
                     To. 1. fo. 248 
                  That those Christians which attempted to breake the Idols of the Gentiles, and were slaine by them, should not be numbred amongst the Martyrs) was made

to deterre men from following such examples, as Eulalia, who being a maide of twelue years, came from her fathers house,

                   that as a Catholique Author hath obserued, that state which inflicted those persecutions; sometimes made Edicts, that no more Christians should be executed, because they perceiued how much contentment and satisfaction, and complacency some of them had in such dying.
               3 And although these irregular and exorbitant actes be capable of a good interpretation; that is, that the spirit of God did by secret insinuations e

                  cite and inflame them, and such as they were, to pu

                   feruor into others at that time; yet certainly God hath already made his vse of them, and their examples belong no more to vs, in this part and circumstance of such excesses.
               4 And though this secret and inward instinct and mouing of the holy Ghost, which the Church presumes, to haue guided not onely these martyres, in whose forwardnesse these authors haue obserued some incongruity with the rules of Diuinity, but also Sampson, and those Virgines which drowned themselues

                        s. ca. 24 which are also acounted by that Church as martyres; although (I say) this instinct lie not

in proofe, nor can be made euident; yet there are many other reasons, which authorize and iustifie those zealous transgressions of theirs (if any such were): or make them much more excuseable, then any man can be in these times, and in these places wherein we liue.
               5 For the persecutions in the Primitiue Church were raised either by the Gentiles or the Arrians; either the vnity of the God-head, or the Trinity of the persons was euer in question: which were the Elements of the Christian Religion, of which it was fram'd and complexioned; and so to shake that, was to ruine and demolish all. And they were also the Alphabet of our Religion, of which no infant or Neophyte might be ignorant. But now the integrity of the beliefe of the Roman Church, is the onely forme of Martyrdome; for it is not allowed for a Martyrdome to witnes by our blood,

                  6 This constant defence of the foundation, and this vndisputable euidence of the truth, was their warrant: And they had another double reason, of making them extremely tender, and fearefull of slipping from their profession; which was first the subtilties and Artifices of their aduersaries, to get them to doe some acte, which might imply a transgressing and dereliction of their Religion, though it were not directly so; and so draw a scandall vpon their cause, and make their simplicity seeme infirmity, and impiety: and secondly, the seuerity which the Church vsed towards them, who had done any such acte, and her bitternesse and a
                     •
                  ersenes, from re assuming them, euen after long penances, into her bosome. For by the third Canon of the Eliberitane Counc
                     •
                  l, which I ment
                     •
                  oned before, it appeares, that euen they whom they called Libellaticos, because they had for money bargained and contracted with the State, to spare them from sacrificing to Idolles (though this were done but to redeeme their vexation and trouble) were seperated from the holy Communion. But none of these reasons can aduantage or relieue those of the Romane perswasion in these times, because no point of Catholique faith, either primary and radicall, or issuing from thence by necessary deduction and consequence, is impugned by vs; nor their faith in those points, wherin it abounds aboue ours,

explicated to them by any euidence, which is not subiect to iust quarrell and exception; nor are our Magistrates laborious or actiue to withdrawe them by any snares from their profession, but only by the open and direct way of the word of God, if they would heare it nor is the Church so sowre and tetricall, but that she admits with ease and ioy, those, which after long straying, not only into that Religion, but into such treasons and disobediences, as that Religion produces, returne to her againe.
            
            
               CHAP. III. That the Romane Religion doth by many erroneous doctrines misencourage and excite men to this vicious affectation of danger: first by inciting secular Magistracy: secondly by extolling the value of merites, and of this worke in special, by which the treasure of the Church is so much aduanced: and lastly, by the doctrine of Purgatory, which by this acte is said certainely to be escaped.
               
                  The first part of Principallity and Priest-hood.
                  
                     
                     HAuing laide this foundation, that the greatest Dignitie, wherewith God hath enriched mans nature, (next to his owne assuming thereof) may suffer some infirmitie: yea, putrefaction, by admixture

of humane and passionate respects, if when we are admitted to bee witnesses of Gods honour, we loue our owne glory too much, or the Authoritie by which this benefit is deriu'd vpon vs, too little, which is the function of secular Magistracie: We are next to consider, by what inducements, and prouocations, the Doctrine and practise of the Romane Church doth put forward, and precipitate our slipperie disposition into this vicious and inordinate affection, and dangerous selfe-flatterie.
                  2 In three things especially they seeme to me, to aduance and 
                        •
                     oment this corrupt inclination. First, by abasing, and auiling the Dignitie and persons of secular Magistrates, by extolling Ecclesiasticke immunities and priuiledges: Secondly, by dignifying and ouer-valewing our merits and satisfactions, and teaching that the treasure of the Church, is by this expence of our blood increased. And thirdly, by the Doctrine of Purgatorie, the torments whereof are by this suffering said to be escaped and auoided.
                  3 And in the first point, which is a dis-estimation of Magistracie, they offend two wayes. Comparatiuely, when they compare together that and Priest-hood, and Positiuely, when not bringing the Priestly function into the ballance, or disputation, they giue the Pope authority as Supreame spirituall Princesse, ouer all Princes.
                  
                     4 When the first is in question of Priesthood and Magistracy, then enters the Sea, yea Deluge of Canonists, and ouerflowes all, and carries vp their Arke (that is the Romane Church, that is the Pope) fifteene cubites aboue the highest hils, whether Kings or Emperours.

of their Rescripts to Popes, and the Epistles of the Popes to them. For we see, by the Imperial Law, the Authoritie of the Prince and the Priest made equall, when it is decreed,

                     That no man may remoue a body out of a Monument in the Church, without a Decree of the Priest, or Commandement of the Prince. And yet there appeares much difference, in degrees of absolutenesse of power, betweene these limitations of a Decree and a Commandement. And Leo the first, writing to the Emperour Martianus, reioyses, that he found

Thus then he writes to him, Cupio vestrae Clementiae studijs adiuuari, That so no error may be committed in the obseruation thereof. And Leo the eight,
                        Leo 8. Epist. 87. exhorts the Sonnes of Charles, as partners in his Pastorall care to imploy Baculos redargutionis. And concerning some spiritual matters, then to be determined, he ends his Epistle thus, The penne must first be dipped in the fountaine of your heart, and then my Hand shall frame the Characters. And so when a Bishop of Constantinople stood out in some things against the Emperor,

                  14 And when this correspondence was intermitted, as it appeares often to haue beene, to the preiudice of the whole Church, the Emperours were euer forwardest to labour a re-union and concurrence of their powers, to the benefit and peace thereof;

And when an Emperour had created a Bishop of Antioch, contrary to the forme prescrib'd in the Nicene Councell, of an intire obseruation, whereof the christian Church was extremly zealous, the Pope proceedes not by anullings and vociferations, but writes thus to the Emperour: We may not dissallow that which you haue done holily and religiously out of a loue to peace and quietnes: by which we see that Canons of Councels, though they were Directions, yet they were not Obligations vpon Princes for their gouernement. By all which it appeares, that those Christian and Orthodoxe Emperors, iustifying their inherent right, by these frequent and vn-interrupted matters of fact, apprehended not this vast and incomprehensible distance betweene secular and ecclesiastique power, but that they were compatible enough, and

conduced, and concurred to one perfection, and harmony of the whole state.

Nothing in the world is more spirituall and delicate, and tender then the conscience of a man; yet by good consent of Diuines, otherwise diuersly perswaded in Religion, the ciuill lawes of Princes doe binde our consciences: and shall the persons of any men, or their temporal goods, be thought to be of so sublimed, and spirituall a nature, that the ciuill constitutions of Princes cannot worke vpon them?

For the Pope will not now be a meere Soule and Spirit, but Spiritualis homo,

of Gentilisme, which they retain'd sometimes, after Christian Religion had receiued roote amongst them; as they did also their Gladiatorie spectacles, and other wastefull prodigalities of mens liues; and Bondage and seruility, and some other such: yet neither in them, nor in other Princes, is the danger so great, if they should continue in them, as it is in the Bishoppes of Rome. For Princes, by assuming these Titles, do but draw men to a iust reuerence, and estimation of that power, which subiects naturally know to be in them: but the other, by these Titles seeke to build vp, and establish a power, which was euer litigious and controuerted, either by other Patriarchs, or by the Emperours: for Bellarmine hauing vndertaken to proue the Pope,

                      and the Iesuite Sâ, interpret the first part of this Scripture of Iudges: Since, I say, they entend worse ends then Princes doe, in accepting or assuming like Titles; and since they worke vpon a more dangerous and corruptible subiect, which is the Conscience and Religion; since they require a stronger assurance in vs by faith; since they threaten greater penalties in any which doubt thereof, which is damnation; the popes cannot be so excuseable in this excesse as princes may be. And yet princes neuer went so farre as the popes haue done, as we shall see, when we come to consider the title and power of spirituall princes.
                  All this I say, not to encourage princes to returne to those stiles, which Christian humilitie hath made them dis-accustome, and leaue off,

and which could not be reassum'd without much scandall, but to shew the iniquitie and peruersnesse of those men, who thinke great Titles belong to Kings, not as Kings, but as Papisticall Kings.
                  43 For so at a Consultation of Iesuites in the Tower, in the late Queenes time, I saw it resolued, that in a Petition to bee exhibited to her, shee might not be stiled Sacred.

And our English Iesuites vse to aggrauate her defection much, by that circumstance, that shee had beene Consecrated, and pontifically Anoynted, and inuested at her Coronation, and therefore was Sacred.
                  44 How great a detestation they had of her Honour, and of all Princes which professe the same Religion that shee did, appeares in no one such thing more, then in Quirogaes expurgatorie Index, where admitting all the reprochfull calumnies of Eunapius against Martyrs,
                        Index Expurg. Hispan. fo. 92. whose reliques he cals Salita Capita, with other opprobrious contumelies, they haue onely expunged an Epistle of Iunius to her, in which there was no words concerning Religion, but onely a gratulation of her Peace, and of her Learning; which also they haue done in Serranus his Edition of Plato.
                     
                        Ibid. fol. 150. And

as God hath continued his fauours showen to her, vpon her successour, so haue they their malice: For in the second Tome of that worke,
                        Ibid. fol. 151. they haue taken away an Epistle Dedicatorie to his Maiestie, that now is.
                  45 And as in many of their Rules, for that Dissection and Anatomising of Authours, they haue prouided that all Religion, and all prophane knowledge shall depend vpon their will: So haue they made a good offer, that all cariage of State businesse shall bee open to them,
                        Instruct. circa. lib. corrig. §. 10. by expunging all such sentences, as instructor remember Princes, in that learning, which those Rules cals Rationem status, and which (because Italians haue beene most conuersant therein) is vulgarly called Ragion di stato. For this Ragion di stato, is, as the Lawyers call it, Ius Dominationis; And as others call it, Arcana Imperij. And it pretends no farther but to teach, by what meanes a Prince, or any Soueraigne state, may best exercise that power which is in them, and giue least offence to the Subiects, and yet preserue the right and dignitie of that power.
                  46 For it is impossible, that any Prince should proceede in all causes & occurrences, by a downright Execution of his Lawes: And he shall certainely be frustrated of many iust and lawfull ends, if he discouer the way by which he goes to them. And therefore these disguisings, and auerting

of others from discerning them, are so necessarie, that though, In Genere rei, they seeme to be within the compasse of deceite and falshood, yet the end, which is, maintenance of lawfull Authoritie, for the publike good, iustifies them so well, that the Lawyers abhorre not

                     o giue them the same definition (with that Addition of publike good) which they doe to deceit it selfe. For they define Ragion di stato to be, Cumaliud agitur, aliud simulatur, bono publico.

                     47 And the Romane Authors doe not onely teach, that deceit is not Intrinsecè malum, but vpon that ground and foundation, they build Equiuocation, which is like a Tower of Babel, both because thereby they get aboue all earthly Magistracie, and because therein no men can vnderstand one another. Nor can there be a better example giuen of the vse of this Ragion di stato, then their forbidding it
                        •
                      Because nothing conduces more to the aduancing of their strength, then that Princes should not know, or not vse their owne, or proceede by any wayes remou'd from their discernings. Indeed those bookes of Expurgation, are nothing else but Ragion di stato: That is, a disguised and dissembled way, of preferring their double Monarchie. And they that fordid Princes the lawfull vse of these Arcana Imperij, practise for their owne ends, euen Flagitia Imperij, which are the same things, when they exceede

their true endes (which are iust authority, and the publique good) or their lawfull waies to those ends, which should euer be within the compasse of vertue, and religion.

                  52 But Baronius more then any other exceeds in this point, for obeying his owne scope and first purpose to aduance the Sea of Rome, he spares not the most obedient childe of that mother, the Catholique King of Spaine: for, speaking of the Title which that King hath to the Kingdome of Sicily,

                      Nor doth Baronius repent that, which hee hath spoken of those kings, but in his answere to this Cardinall; he saies, that if the King were impeccable, if he were an Angell, if he were God himselfe, yet he is subiect to iust reproofe.
                     
                        Nu. 19. And in his Epistle to Phil. 3. in excuse of himselfe, though hee seeme to spare the present

king, yet it is (as he professes) because he hopes that he will relinguish that Iurisdiction in Sicily; els he is subiect to all those reproofs & reproches, which Baro. hath laid vpon his father and Grandfather.
                  54 And though this were a great excesse in Baronius, to lay such aspersions vpon those Princes, yet his malice appeares to bee more generall; for the reason why he makes this pretence so intollerable,
                        Nu. 28. is, because thereby (saies he) that King becomes a Monarch; and there can be no other Monarch in the world,

And so this care of his, that no Monarches be admitted, implies his confession, that they which are Monarches haue right in their Dominions, to all that which those kings claime in Sicily, which is as much as our kings exercise in England, (if Baronius do not exceede in his imputation.)

                         for I haue both performed my obedience to the Emperor, and I haue vttered that which I thought fit concerning God. And he was wisely careful that his Letter to the Emperour, concerning his opnion

of the iniquitie of that Law, should not come to the Emperours inopportunely, nor as from a person of equall ranke to him; and therefore he forbids his own Responsall (for the dignitie of a Nuncio, was not yet in vse) to deliuer it, but sends it to the Emperours Phisitian, because saith he,

                  60 And in all this course of time, the Popes, some out of a iust contemplation of their duety, some out of the neede, which they had of the Emperours, from whom they receiued daily some additions to their immunities and exemptions,

were agreeable and appliable enough to them. And when Italy suffered a dereliction, by the absence of the Emperours in the East, and thereby was prostituted and exposed to barbarous Inuaders, the Bishoppes of this Citie, which was the fairest marke to inuite the Lumbards and the rest, solicited those Easterne Emperours to their succour, with all sweetnesse and humility; but at last, desperate of such reliefe, casting their eyes vppon the mightiest kingdome of the West, they inuited the French to their succour.
                  
                     
                        Epist. 2.61 And at this time came from them those lamentable supplications, which Stephen the third sent to Pipin and Carloman: In the first whereof, he vrges them with their promise of certaine lands, by them vowed to the Church: And hauing called them, Dominos excellentissimos, and spiritualem Compatrem, and prepared them with wordes of much sweetenesse, Mellifluam bonitatem, Mellifluos obtutus, and such, hee comes to the point: That which you haue offered to Peter by promise, you ought to deliuer him in profession, least when the Porter of heauen, the Prince of the Apostles, at the daie of iudgement shall shew your hand-writing you be put to make a more strict account with him. So therefore he felt and lamented their slackenes in endowing the Church; yet at that time he would not vndertake to be the Iudge, nor make the Camera Apostolica the Court; but he referres it to Saint Peter, and to the last

day, and onely remembers them, That Dominus per meam humilitatem, mediante B. Petro, vos vnxit in reges.
                  
                  62 The next letter written in the person of the Pope, and all the Romane people, and Romane armie, et omnium in afflictione positorum, is an earnest and violent coniuration; per Deum viuum vos coniuro, Saue vs, most Christian Princes before we perish; the soules of all the Romans hang vpon you, and so forth. And when all this did not effectually stirre them to come, as the letter solicited, Cum nimia festinatione; then came a third letter in the name and person of Saint Peter himselfe,
                        Epist. 4. in this stile: I Peter the Apostle, and by me all the Catholique Romane Church, Head of all the Churches of God, vobis viris excellentissimis. I Peter, exhort you, my adopted Sonnes, to defend that house, where I rest in my flesh: and with me Marie, with great Obligations, Aduises, and Protests, and so forth. And whatsoeuer you shall aske of me, I will giue you. If you doe not performe this, know ye, that by the authoritie of the Apostleshippe giuen me by Christ, you are alienated from the Kingdome of God, and from life euerlasting.

And then, in an inconstant distemper, he threatens, and he promises in St. Peters name, as bitterly, and as liberally, as his predecessor had bid S. Peter himselfe to doe, in the former Epistle.

a whole Chapter in his booke for the reproofe thereof, yet not onely that Pope dissembled it, but this drawes it into example and precedent.
                  65 And in this letter the Pope giues the Emperour some light, that hee is not long to enioy the stile of Romane Emperour; for he hauing despised the Romane tongue as Barbarous, (as euery Prince loues to be saluted in his owne, or in an equall language) the Pope replies: That if hee call the Romane tongue barbarous, because

                        Epist. 30. to Arcadius the Emperour, whom he thought guilty of the eiecting & of the death of Chrysostome: His words are; Ego minimus & peccator, segrego te a perceptione mysteriorum Christi. This then went no farther then to depriue him of spirituall foode, and the Pope (if tha

                        Anno 1063.74 Of which there appeares to me no euidence, no discernable impression, no iust suspition, till Gregory the seuenths time: And then, as it may well be said of Phalaris his letters, that they were al writ for execution, and of Brutus his letters, that they were all Priuy Seales for money: so may wee

                        I. 2. Ep. 5. hee first threatned it to the Fench King, and then practised it effectually vpon the Emperour. To the Bishoppes of France he writes, That their King Philip is not to be called King, but a Tyrant, which by perswasion of the Diuel is become the

cause and the head of all mischiefe: Therefore (saies he) all you must endeauour to bow him. (And thus farre his Pastorall care might binde him) And to shew him, that he cannot escape the sword of Apostolique animadu

But when he adds, Depart from communion with him, and obedience to him, forbid Diuine Seruice throughout all France, and if he repent not, we will attempt to take the Kingdome from his possession they are wordes of Babel,
                     
                        Li. 2. Ep. 18. which no man at that time vnderstood: yet he writes in the same tenour to the Earle of Poicton, That if the king perseuere, both he and all which giue any obedience to him, shall be sequestred from the communion of the Church, by a Councell to be held at Rome. So assuredly, and confidently could hee pronounce before hand of a future determination in a Councell there.
                  76 And of his owne seuerity, vsed towards the Emperour, whom vpon seuere penances hee had resumed

                     hey wished to fall vpon them that offended: and such I doubt not, was Gregories Imprecation, in his successors interpretations, that is, that hee wished all Kings to be depriued.
                  
                     L. 4. Ep. 2.89 His next reason why Princes may be deposed by Priests, is the diuersity of their Beginning and first Institution
                           •
                        
                      for, as before he had said to another

                     Bishop of the same place, Regall Dignity was found out and inuented by humane pride, but Priests were intituled by the Diuine pietie, So here he repeates it with more contumely; Who knowes not that Kings had their beginnings from those men
                           •
                         who being ignorant of God, and prouoked by the prince of the world the Diuell, through Pride, Rapine, Perfidiousnesse, Murder, and all wickednesse, affected a gouernment ouer their equalls, by a blind Ambition, and intolerable presumption.
                  
                  90 Then he proceeds to the examples, of Innocent who excomunicated Arcadius, and of Zachary who deposed Childerique. The first of which is not to the purpose, Except Excommunication presume Deposing which Innocent intended not. And the second hath beene abundantly, and satisfactorily spoken to, by very many of ours, and of their owne authors, who determine it roundly,15.9. b. Alius. glo

                  91 And therefore insisting little vpon these, hee makes hast to that wherein he excels, which is, to reproach and debase the State and Order of Kings. For he says, That euen Exorcists (which is no sacred order) are superiour to Princes. Nor is his intemperance therefore excessiue, because hee subiects men to such as are in the way going towards Priesthood, for that will bee still vpon the old ground, that priesthood is in an incomprehensible distance and proportion aboue principalitie,

but his reasons why Exorcists are aboue Princes, discouers more malignitie to Princes absolutely; which is, That since they are aboue the Diuell himselfe, much more are they Superiour to those which are subiect to the deuill, and members of the deuill. Nor could his argument haue any life or force here, except he presum'd Kings to be poysoned & corrupted by the very place, & by the order it selfe; for otherwise, if he meant it onely of vicious Kings, why should he institute this comparison of Exorcists and Kings, since it ought to bee of Exorcists and vicious men? And therefore (as he sayes after in this Ep
                        •
                     stle,) That he finds in his owne experience, that the Papacie either finds good men, or makes them good, and that if they want goodnesse of their owne, they are supplied by their predecessours, and so, Aut Clari eriguntur, aut Erecti illustrantur: So he thinkes either, that onely members of the deuill come to be Kings, or that kings grow to be such, when they are kings. For so much he intimates euen in this place, when hee sayes, In Regall dignitie very few are saued, and from the beginning of the world til now, we find not one King equal in sanctitie to innumerable Religious men. What King hath done any miracles? To what King haue Churches or Altars beene erected? How man

                      And Sayr proceedes further, and saies, that though Panormitane be of opinion, That one can prescribe in no more then that which he hath put in practise, yet if hee haue so exercised any one act of Iurisdiction (as excōmunication is) as that he had a will to doe all, he prescribes in all. And there is no doubt, but that when Pius the fift excommunicated, he had a good will to Depose also.
                  99 From this also haue proceeded all those enormous deiections of Princes, which they cast and deriue vpon al Kings when they speake them of the Emperour: for though the later writers, are broder with the Emperour, and chose rather to exemply in him, then in any other Soueraigne

Prince; vpon this aduantage, that they can more easily proue a Supremacy ouer him, by reason of the pretended translation of the Empire, yet it is a slippery way and conueyance of that power ouer all other Princes; since in common intendment and ordinary acceptation, no man can be exempt from that, to which the Emperour is subiect. And of the Emperour they say,

                        y hath had as great a dignification in this point from God, as Sacerdotall; and to neither hath God giuen any necessary obligation of perpetuall enduring in that certaine forme. So that, that which Bellarmine in another place sayes to be a speciall obseruation,
                     
                        De Pont. l. 2. c. 17. §. Obseruandum.
                      wee acknowledge to bee so: which is, That in the Pope are three things; His place, his person, and the vnion of them: the first is onely from Christ, the second, from those that elect him, and the third from Christ, by mediation of a humane act.
                  
                  And as wee confesse all this in the Pope, so hath he no reason to denie it to be also in kings: he addes further, That the Cardinals are truly said, To create the Pope, and to be the cause why such a man is Pope, and why he hath that power; but yet they doe not giue him that power: as in generation, a father is a cause of the vnion of the body and soule, which yet is infused onely from God. And in all this we agree with Bellarmine; and we adde, that all this is common to all supreame, secular, or Ecclesiastique Magistrates.
                  101 And yet in Hereditary kings, there is lesse concurrence, or assistance of humane meanes, then either in elected kings, or in the Pope himselfe: for in such secular states, as are prouided by election, without all controuersie the supreame power, in euery vacancy, resides in some subiect,

and inheres in some body, which as a Bridge, vnites the defunct, and the succeeding Prince. And how can this be denied to be in the Colledge of Cardinals,

                  102 Certainely all power is from God; And as if a companie of Sauages, should consent and concurre to a ciuill maner of liuing, Magistracie, & Superioritie, would necessarily, and naturally, and Diuinely grow out of this consent (for Magistracie and Superioritie is so naturall and so immediate from God, that Adam was created a Magistrate, and he deriu'd Magistracie by generation vpon the eldest Children, and (as the Schoolemen say) if the world had continued in the first Innocency, yet there should haue beene Magistracie.) And into what maner and forme soeuer they had digested and concocted this Magistracie, yet the power it-selfe was Immediately from God: So also, if this Companie, thus growen to a Commonwealth,
                     
should receiue further light, and passe, through vnderstanding the Law written in all hearts, and in the Booke of creatures, and by relation of some instructers, arriue to a sauing knowledge, and Faith in our blessed Sauiours Passion, they should also bee a Church, and amongst themselues would arise vp, lawfull Ministers for Ecclesiastique function, though not deriued from any other mother Church, & though different from all the diuers Hierarchies established in other Churches: and in this State, both Authorities might bee truely said to bee from God.1.2 ae. q. 103. ad 3 To which purpose Aquinas sayes express

applyed or no, so it be to the profit and aduantage of that Church.

                  And by this meanes, as when they determined to kill the Emperor Henry the seuenth, that they might poison him, they forbore not to poison their owne God in the Sacrament first: so when they purposed to teare and deface the name and honour, and lawes of the King, they first offer the same violence to the word of God himselfe.

                     Baronius detorts to the

excommunication of Christians. Onely they are content to spare scriptures, when they come to defend their late-borne Heresies; for, for the necessity of beleeuing Purgatory, Inuocation, Transubstantiation, and some others of the same age, they offer no scripture; but they thinke it victory enough that Galatine can proue all these out of the Talmud, and Cusanus out of the Alcoran: For, for the olde and new Testaments, they finde other employment. They must serue them against the office and dignity of Princes, to exhibite them as a prey to their neighbours, and a scorne to their owne Subiects.

by their Constitutions, haue exempted them, without asking leaue of Princes, but they pretend text of Scriture, though detorted and misvs'd, to proue this Exemption. And for the Persons they pretend many; but with no more directnes, then that by which they proue exemption of their goods,

                  And if that Nation grow into iealousies, and feele her right, as France hath done before, all the Italian Writers, will be but weake euidence, to proue this exemption to bee Iure Diuino. But as though all this were not enough, and that the states of Princes were not enough infirm'd by withdrawing of all these, they teach,

Vpon all which, what mischieuous conclusions will follow, is euident and obuious enough.
                  
                     118 To conclude therefore this point this Ecclesiastique immunity which they clayme, is the debasing of Princes; And the defence of this immunity, and consequently of this deb

And thus farre I was willing to extend this point, That the Romane Doctrine by extolling Church Priuiledges aboue Princes, and by an absolute and direct auiling them, doth mis-prouoke her disciples to a vicious affectation of imaginarie Martyrdome. In the two other points of Merite and Purgatory, which produce the same effect, I may haue leaue to contract my selfe, into a shorter roome, because of those, many others haue spoken more abundantly, then of this last point which I vndertooke.

                  THe next Doctrine which I noted to mis-incite  men to an imagined Martyrdome, is the Doctrine of Merites.

                     In euery good worke, you say, there is somewhat of merite, and somewhat of satisfaction. The first is said to belong to our selues, and that by it we establish our saluation: So that the passion of our Sauiour is but as Baptisme to vs, and our owne workes, as Confirmation: 
                     
                        Idem de Confirmatione c. 11 § Duplex.
                      Which Sacrament you say, confers more grace then baptisme dooth, for strengthning vs against the Diuell:

                      And that the holy Ghost is giuen more fully therein.
                  And accordingly you teach, that iustice of workes doth giue the forme and life to faith. And the second, which is Satisfaction, is reserued in the common stocke, the treasury of the Church, and husbanded and dispensed by the generall steward thereof the Bishoppe of Rome.
                  2 But for that Merite, which you teach, to say That our workes of their owne nature,
                     
                        Bell. de Iustif. l. 5. c. 17. §. Nobis.
                      
                     without considering any Couenant or Contract with GOD, deserue Heauen, dooth not onely diminish CHRISTS Passion, by associating an Assistant to it, and determine his Priesthood, which is euerlasting, by vsurping that

office our selues, but it preferres our worke before his, because if wee could consider the passion of Christ, without the eternall Decree, and Couenant, and Contract with his father, his worke (sauing the dignity which it had by Acceptation, by which the least step of his humiliation might worthily haue redeemed tenne thousand worlds) had not naturally merited our saluation.
                  3 Now betwixt God and vs there is no such Couenant; our best plea is, The sinner must repent, and God will blotte out his sinnes. If a Prince should so farre prostitute his mercie, as to proclaime a veniall Pardon, by which for certaine money, any Malefactor might be pardoned, no such Malefactor as by the nature of his fault, had at that instant forfaited and confiscated all his estate, should haue benefite by that pardon, because he had nothing to giue. All these dis-aduantages and infirmities oppresse vs; no good worke is naturally large enough to reach heauen; no promise nor acceptation of God hath changed the nature of a good worke: And lastly, we can do no perfit good work; for originall sin hath poisoned the fountaines, our hearts: and those degrees and approaches, which we seeme to make towards good workes, are as if a condemned man would make a large will, to charitable vses. For, as that which hee giues is not his owne, so that goodnesse of good workes is not ours; and as it is

in the Princes pleasure and allowance, whether his will shall take any effect, or no; so is it in the pleasure of God, whether any workes of ours shal be accepted.
                  4 Yet there is more Deuotion in our Doctrine of good works, then in that of the Romane Church, because wee teach as much necessity of them as they doe, and yet tye no reward to them. And we acknowledge, that God doth not onely make our faith, to fructifie and produce good workes as fruits thereof, but sometimes beginnes at our workes: and in a mans hart morally enclined to doe good, dooth build vp faith: for if an Angell could transport Abacuc, for Gods seruice, by onely taking hold of his haire, God can take such holde of our workes, and carrie vs further by them. And fu
                        •
                     ther then this I see not that moderate men may goe: and they startle too easilie that dare not come so farre. And if it had beene expedient for Bellarmine, to haue spoken plaine, I thinke he would haue come to that, when hee was so neere towards it, as to say, That it is the safest way to place all our confidence in the onely mercy of God,

                  5 The Doctrine of good workes in the Reformed Churches, is vniforme and consonant. For though Luther, to relieue and succour the doctrine of faith, which then languish'd desperately in the Romane Church, for iust dignification thereof, sometimes omitted, sometimes spoke remissely of good workes, yet betweene those, who seuerely adhere to him, & other Churches, which in some other things depart a little from them, in this point, I haue obserued no dissention.

                      that to worship the diuell himselfe in such a forme, with opinion that it were God, is not Idolatry,) not onely for these inconueniences, but euen for a generall infamy and suspition, that these apparitions which begot Purgatorie haue in them, the more moderate sort of Catholiques haue declined from any great approuing of them.

                  8 And yet I denie not, but that in sober antiquitie, and in the grauest Fathers, there are some impressions, which occasioned this error, of purifying

soules after this life, As Bellarmine sayes truly,

                     that for the most part, lies haue their foundation vpon some truth; For it was very long in the Church of God, before the state of the soule after our death, was cleare, and constant and vniforme: the Fathers being diuided in their opinions, whether our soules enioyed perfect happinesse presently, or expected and attended it till the generall iudgement. And the phrase and language, in which sometimes they spoke of the last consummation of our happinesse, in the re-vnion of the body and soule, being obscure, and various, gaue occasion of doubting, that they reserued and adiourn'd all our happinesse till that time. And that which they meant of that perfect and consummate happinesse, not to bee enioyed till then, hath beene mis-vnderstood, or detorted to the soule alone. And by such irresolution in some, and perplexity in collating their opinions, and misapplying their words, haue been imprinted indelible characters of Purgatorie, and of prayer for the dead, of whose condition in the next worlde, they were not t

                      when being pressed by Nilus, to followe in the question of the Primacie, the opinion of the Fathers, sayes, that the Pope hath no

Fathers in the Church, but that they are all his Sonnes. Nor can wee exceede Bellarmine in dis-esteeming the Fathers, who hath called in question some bookes of almost euerie one of them, as Clement, Anicetus, Cyprian, Tertullian, Ambrose, Augustine, Hierome, Damasus, Damascen, Basil, Iustine, Nyssene, Honorius, Eusebius, Chrysostome and others.
                  
                  And when Damascene cites out of Palladius, That a dead scull beeing asked, whether our Prayers did them any good in hell, aunswered, that it brought them some ease and relaxation, Bellarmine sayes, This is false, and Apocryphall, and that there is no such thing in Paladius:

                      So ill a Patrone is hee, of Damascenes credite heerein. Nor doth hee onely indefinitely say of the Fathers, That it is euident that some of the chiefest of them haue grieuously erred, but as of Tertullian, who imputes Montanisme to Pope Zephirine, hee sayes,

                     There is no faith at all to be giuen to him, And in another place somewhat more sharply; Wee doe not reckon Tertullian amongst the Catholiques, So doth he to very many of the other Fathers, boldly impute such errours, as would vitiate any Author not to haue but obserued them, and for touching whereof the Centuriators are by him accounted prophane and blasphemous. So also doth Medina say,

                        Ind.

                  11 For we need not (euen by your frequent examples,) binde our selues to that seruility, which your Azorius subiects himselfe vnto:

Lyra, and some other Catholiques, denie her death, yet, saies he, because we are bound (that is, by the oath of the Trent Councell) to expound Scriptures according to the sense of the Fathers, I thinke we ought to adhere to the opinion that she was slaine. But if the sense of the Fathers did not stand in my way, to confesse the truth, I should approue the other opinion, because that deliuers so great a person as Iephthe was, both from rashnesse and foolishnesse in making the vow, and from impietie and cruelty in keeping it.

Of which sort of Fathers, in my poore reading, I neuer found any that consented with the Doctrine of Purgatorie now established.

both pretended the solicitation of Ignatius his canonizing to belong to them, and both affected the honour of procuring it, the pursuite and effecting thereof hath beene intermitted and retarded. And howsoeuer for Ignatius and for Xauerius, who was also a Nauarrois as well as Ignatius, it might please those Princes, for respect to one another to forbeare any solicitation in their behalfes, yet the King of Spaine had very many subiects in

And though the present Pope Paulus the fift, haue beene much solicited for the Canonizing of Gonzaga the Iesuite by the Princes of that Family (the memory of his exempler life being yet fresh,
                     Ceparius de vita Gonzag. Epist. Dedic.
                   and his worthinesse certified (as the custome is in preparing Canonization) by Cardinals which had commission to search therinto) yet he hath allowed him no other title then Beatus: which might haue beene giuen him without that Rescript of the Pope, as Ignatius and many other haue it: since, as Serarius saies,
                     Litan eut. l. 2. q. 7 
                  Custome giues that Title to those, of whose saluation there is a strong opinion, and yet are not adorned with the publique testimony of the Church.
               
               11 Nor doe I perceiue that they are in any great forwardnesse, to get a Saint, since in canonizings

after the consideration of the truth of the miracles, they fall in the Consistory to another consideration, of the sufficiency of them. And besides that,
                     De procurand. Indo. Salut. l. 2. c. 9. your own Acosta makes vs doubt of the truth of those miracles, which are related, because he spends a Chapter in giuing reasons, why in our age, in preaching the Gospell in the Indies, there is not that strength of miracles, which was in the primitiue Church, since, as he saies there, It would preuaile very much, if it might be, those which are said to be done by you, are for the most part so poore and beggerly, and silly things in respect of the Franciscans, as betweene yours and theirs there is as much difference, as betweene Iugling and Coniuring.
               12 Me thinks you should offer no more to plaie at that game, after you haue beleeued (as I hope you doe, since so fresh, and so well approoued an author as Sedulius giues new life to these miracles) That S Anthony when the heretiques refused to heare him preach,

                  and some did but bow their heads, and so the Heretiques were conuerted: or that Frier Andrew to correct his appetite of eating birds, at the Table, by the signe of the Crosse, commanded them to flie away, though they were rosted.
               
               13 And how much more luxuriant of Miracles

would their Historie be,
                     Id. l. 3 c. 24 n. 25 26.27. if they had not commanded Friar Conrade to doe no more Miracles after his death, because he was buried out of their Colledge: And if Saint Francis had not enioyn'd Friar Peter, vpon his Graue, Per sanctam obedientiam, that he should doe no more Miracles, because they were thereby disquieted with concurse of people. Of which kinds there are many Commaundements, which lessons their number of Miracles.
               14 And this Philip Nerius, founder of the last Order,
                     Vita. Nerij. fol. 488. fear'd in himselfe, and therefore hee told Baronius, that he had intreated God that he might doe no Miracles.
               15 You can therefore in nothing equall that order of Franciscanes; for if you thinke to ouertake them in number, you will be farre short. Saint Francis saw at the first Chapter or meeting,
                     Sedul. Apol. l. 2. c. 2. n. 3. sixe thousand Friers, and eighteene thousand Deuils, which Ignatius could neuer get neere,

                   except hee made it out in Deuils. For the whole number of his societie, doeth not much exceede ten thousand yet.
               16 But that which is truly proper and peculiar to you, you doe earnestly and intensly, and you excell in it; which is, in kindling and blowing, begetting and nourishing ielowsies in Princes, and contempt in Subiects, dissention in families, wrangling in Schooles, and mutinies in Armies; ruines of Noble houses, corruption of blood,

confiscation of States, torturing of bodies, and anxious entangling and perplexing of consciences. And to facilitate your way to these effects, you are in your institution mixt and complexioned of all Elements, and you hange betweene Heauen and Earth, like Meteors of an ominous and incendiarie presaging. You pretend to forsake the world, and to looke all vpward; But, saith Cassianus, Such renunciation is threefold; Of all temporall fortunes, and of our maners and conditions, and of our minds from all present things. But all your labour is to vnderstand the present state of Kingdomes, and where any ouerture is giuen for the Popes aduantage, and where any interposition or hinderance is interiected against his purposes. And therefore that saying of Saint Basil to a Senatour,
                  
                     Cassian. l. 7. c. 19. that seem'd to renounce the world, and yet retain'd part of his state, Thou hast spoyled a Senatour, and hast not made a Monke, belongs almost to all of this Order. For you are but as Eunuches; you haue lost your apprehension and capacitie of worldly Estates, yet the lust, and itche, and concupiscence, to be conuersant therein, remaines with you still.

For if this opinion had beene beleeued and authorized, the secrets of all states, and passages of all Courts, had had no other Register then the breasts of Iesuites; who are so wise Apothecaries of penances, and haue so plentifull shops of those druggs of Indulgencies, that all those Princes, to whom any of them had beene Confessor, would neither open their disease, nor seeke their physicke at any other place: when they might be deliuered of the painefullest part of Confession, which is the personall shame of accusing ones selfe.

               32 And then, as all recidiuations and relapses, are worse then the disease, vpon this relapse, came the Councell of Trent, which did couer and palliate some of these vlcers, and promised the cure of the rest, though they neuer went about it yet; And then the Iesuites, who crie that all there is health and soundnesse, and that there is none any where else yea that the Church was borne thus, and that she is as well, as she was in her Cradle, and that whatsoeuer she thinkes, or saies, or does

is by a diuine power, inherent in her; as though there had beene sowed in her at first certaine seedes of Iure Diuino, which now in our age, by the cultiuating, and watering, and industry of the Iesuites must fructifie and produce in her, all these effects. For they will abate nothing; their consciences are as tender and delicate,

               35 For there are diuers poysons which cannot work, except they be eiaculated from the creature it selfe that possesseth it, and that his personall and

present liuely malignity concurre to it, and giue it vigour; for which these vbiquitary Monks haue the aduantage of all others.
               36 Nimietates sunt aequalitates, saies Cassianus. And so, two extreamities, haue made the Schoolemen and the Iesuites equally valiant: for the Schoolemen out of an ignorance of danger, hauing neuer come to hand-blowes, would venter vpon any peece of seruice, and any employment, and pierce through and spie, euen into Gods secret Cabinet of his Essence, and of his Counsails, as a fresh Souldier will goe with alacrity to any breach. And then because these sublime and ayrie meditations must haue some body to inhere in, they vsed to incorporate their speculations of God, in the Pope; as it were to arrest and conserue them the better, being else too spirituall and transitorie. And so they haue so much exemplified them, one in the other, that they haue made them so like, and equall in their writings, as though they were but one.
               37 And the Iesuites out of a desperate necessity must maintain their station, because if they yeeld one steppe, they will be the lesse able to stand in the next; but after they haue confessed that the Church hath erred in one thing, thinking that will subiect her in all, no place of Scripture is so abundantly and euidently pregnant, no reason or consequence so directly and necessarily deduced,

and concluded, no History nor matter of fact so faithfully presented, and so certainly and religiously testified, but they will stand stubbornly, and desperately to oppugne and infirme it.

               41 How fast this infection works in them, as by many other Demonstrations, so by this also it appeares euidently, that there are extant more Authors of that one Order, that haue written of Secular businesses, and of Iurisdiction of Princes, then of all the rest, since their beginning. For, their Casuists, which handle Morall Diuinitie, and waigh and measure sinne (which for all that perplexitie and entangling, we may not condemne too hastily, since in purest Antiquitie there are liuely impressions of such a custome in the Church, to examine with some curiositie the circumstances, by which sinnes were aggrauated or diminished) doe not onely, abound in Number, especially of the Spanish Nation, but haue filled their bookes with such questions as these, How Princes haue their iurisdiction, How they may become Tyrants, What is lawfull to a priuate man in such a case, and of, like seditious nature. So that they haue abandoned the stale, and obsolete names, of positiue Diuinity, or Controuerted, or Schoole Diuinitie; and haue reduced all to Crowne Diuinity.
               
               42 And yet they account the handling of

these points, to bee but a dull and obuious learning in their Colledges, as though any man were able to resolue questions against Princes

               43 So also of the Immunitie of the Church, out of which, if it be denied to be by the Indulgence of the Prince, issues and results presently the dimunition of the Prince, they haue written abundantly, and desperately. So haue they of the Institution of a Prince;

               46 And I do not remember, that I haue found in the Approbation of any Iesuits booke, this clause which is so ordinary, in most of the workes of other men, Nihil fidei contrarium, aut bonis Moribus,

yeares neglected his owne defence, and answered such great men as opposed him, onely with such Proctors as Gretzer, and Eudaemo-Ioannes, vnprouoked he rises vp in the Venetian, and in the English cause, to establish by new bookes, the new Article of Temporall authority in the Pope. And since that,

               49 I allow not now, saies Bellarmine, that which I said before,

Thomas preuailes more with me. Yet he had seene and considered both their reasons before.
               50 In another place he saies, Now I allow not that which I said before, that Paul appealed to Caesar, as to his Iudge.

                  but must necessarily returne into England: Of which oath we will say no more, but onely repeat Baronius his Panegyrique, and incitatorie encouragement, speaking thereof: The holy societie in her safe sheep-folds hath fatted you, as innocent lambes for this Martyrdome, and she sends you forth to triumphes, and aduances you to Crownes. Be therefore couragious and valiant, you who haue vowed and betrothed your blood by an Oath: for my part, I enuie you, that are design'd and apparant martyres, and wish that my end may be like yours. And what he assignes for one cause of this Martyrdome, to which he prouokes them, and congratulates their interest therein, we declared out of his words before in the shutting vp of the last Chapter, which was Defence of Ecclesiastique immunity; that is debasing, and diminishing of Princes.
               And thus we haue gone one steppe further: and to the former, which were, That the desire of Martyrdome might be vicious, & that, as the Roman authors obserue in the first times, it had beeene so; and, That by the Romane doctrine it must of necessity be so, vve haue added now, that the Iesuites more then any, inflame thereunto.
            
            
               
               CHAP. V. That the Missions of the Pope, vnder Obedience whereof they pretend that they come into this Kingdome, can be no warrant, since there are lawes established to the contrarie, to giue them, or those which harbour them, the comfort of Martyrdome.
               
                  IN the end of the second Chapter, I mentioned a Canon of the Eliberitane Councell; And as in that place it had this vse and office, to shew that the intemperate and inopportune affectation of Martyrdome, needed a restraint in some, too aemulous thereof, by Eulalines Example, So may it very properly and needfully haue a place here, because it showes the reasons, why certaine men were not receiu'd for Martyrs, by the Church.
               2 And the Authoritie of this Councell is of great force, as well by reason of the puritie of the time, in which it was celebrated, which was about three hundred and fiue yeeres after Christ, and twentie yeere before the Nicene Councell, as especially, in this point of Martyrdome, because it was held in continuing Persecution, and when the danger was imminent in those parts, in which the people needed direction and instruction

                     o the number of Martyrs. Because, this is not written in the Gospell, nor found that it was euer done by the Apostles. So that by the opinion of that Councell, that onely is a sufficient cause to intitle and interest a man in the Crowne of Martyrdome, VVhich was found written in the Gospell, or practised by the Apostles. And is there any thing found in either of them, which may be a precedent to this mission?

                   as himselfe sayes, of his practise after, We preach Christ crucified. But this mission from Rome,
                  1. Cor. 1.23. is not to Preach Christ, but his Vicar: Not his kingdome of Grace, or Glorie, but his title to Temporall kingdomes: Not how hee

shall iudge quicke and dead at his second comming, but how his Vicar shall inquire, Examine, Syndicate, Sentence, Depose: yea, Murder Princes on earth: Not Christ crucified, languishing for vs vnder Thorns, Nayles, Whippes & Speares, but his Vicar enthron'd, and wantonly groning vnder the waight of his Keyes, and Swords, and Crownes.
               4 Christ said to those whom he sent, VVhat I tell you in darkenesse,

                  that speake you in light, and what you heare in the eare, that Preach you on houses, and feare not them that kill the body. And if no other thing were told you in darknesse, and whisper'd into your ears, at your missions hither, then those which our Sauiour deliuer'd to them, you might be as confident in your publicke Preachings, and haue as much comfort of Martyrdome, if you died for executing such a Commission. But what your instructions deliuered in darkenesse, and told in your eares, are, appeares now enough, by Inspection, by Confession,

Decemb. 29. by Testimonie, by Practise, by Analogie of your doctrine, and by Baronius words, That you are sent hither to defend the immunities of the Church, which deliuers you from all subiection to the King, and from being Traytors whatsoeuer you attempt: as also to defend the Catholicke Faith, which first makes it heresie to depart from the subiection to Rome, and then makes it a forfeiture of all Iurisdiction to incurre that

heresie. Except this be written in the Gospell, or practised by the Apostles, you cannot be Martyres for this.

                  or commaund any thing, he may lawfully proceede by way of warre, against any that hinder the execution thereof. If then such armies and Fleets were sent to conduct you, and were resisted in their landing, or defeated in battell; had not they as good title to Martyrdome as you? and may not the Pope as well Canonize the whole Spanish Fleete, which perished in 88. for your Catholique faith, and Ecclesiastique immunitie? since in many cases,
                     Commen. in Mat 1. in fine.
                   as in the Innocent children (of whom Hilary saies, that they were exalted to eternity, by Martyrdome) one may bee an implicite

Martyre, though he know not why he died, so he haue no actuall reluctation against it.
               6 And it is very probable, that their title was b

                  m: but for you, (not to dispute now whether the cause be enough for Martyrdome, or whether your obedience can giue it that forme, and life, and vigour) you are so farre from being sent, or from exercising any obedience in this act, that your first step, which is going out of the kingdome, is absolutely and euidently disobedience to your Prince, before you haue any colour of hauing submitted your selfe to any other superiour; and then you enter into the Colledge, vppon condition that you may returne, and you ta
                     •
                  e an Oath before hand that you will returne: So that you returne not hither in obedience of your Superiour, but in performance of your owne vniust, and indiscreete Vowes: both which, in all Vowes, are Annulling or vitiating circumstances. Neither dooth this Oath so farre binde you to returne, (though Nauarrus say so) but that one of the learnedst of the Iesuites, thinkes, If that be forborne, and some Order of Religion embraced in stead thereof,

                  the oath is better performde.
               
               7 And, if these lawes which take holde of you, when you returne hither, had been made betweene the time of your vowe, and your returning:

and if they had beene made directly to that end, to interrupt and preclude the performance of this Vow, yet naturally they would worke the same effect vpon this Vow of yours, and make it voide, because something was now interpos'd, which may iustly, yea ought to change your purpose: For if that law had beene made before, your Vowe had beene vniust from the beginning; which is the case of as many of you, as haue gone since the making of those prohibitory lawes. For a law which forbidds vpon paine of losse of goods,
                  
                     Sayr. Thesau. Cas. Consc. l. 3. c. 7 nu. 25. 
                  death, banishment, or such, bindes a man vpon paine of mortall sinne; and therfore no Vow can iustifie the breach thereof.
               8 All this, if the lawes be iust, is euident and without question, and how could it be euident to all those yong Schollers which went ouer, and made this vowe, that these lawes were vniust? What infallible assurance could they haue of this, to excuse them of disobedience in going, or indiscretion in swearing?
               9 Their owne men teach, that the lawes of Princes are not therefore necessarily vniust and voide,

                  Hee did not grieue that such a law was made, but that the couetousnesse of the Clergy had occasioned these most religious Princes to make that law: So you ought rather to lament, that the Doctrine and practise of some of your principall men, hath raised these iealousies and suspitions in a Prince, out of the conscience of his owne equalitie naturally confident, then murmure at the law, or dis-councell the obedience to it.
               11 For in these cases of naturall preseruation, it is not onely lawfull to make new lawes, but to breake any other, which are not directly Diuine. And if you impute the worst condition of these lawes, which malignitie can obiect to them, which is, that those Catholiques, which are innocent, which meerely out of conscience, abstaine from communicating with vs, in the Word and Sacraments, shall be vtterly starued and depriued of all spirituall sustentation, if the lawes which forbid all Priests to enter, should be still executed; yet that inconuenience will not annull and make voide a law, so farre, as that to doe against it shall be a iust cause of Martyrdome: for in making of lawes, those euils which doe occasionally or consequently a

               20 When the Iesuits were lately expell'd from Venice, and when other Priests which stai'd there, were commanded by Lawes to doe their functions, did either the Iesuites apprehend this opportunitie of Martyrdome, and come backe, or did the Priests find such spirituall comfort in transgressing this Law, that they offred to goe out?
               21 And in all our differences, which fell out in this Kingdome betweene our Kings, and the Popes, when so many capitall Lawes were made

At least why should Campian, and those which were executed before these new statutes, be any better Martyres then they? since they were as good Catholiques as these, and offended the common law of England in the same point, as these.

               2 But to mine vnderstanding we iniure and endanger this cause more, if wee confesse that

that Hierarchie is so Immediately from God as they obtrude it, then we get by offering to drawe Regall power within the same Priuiledge. I had rather thus farre abstaine from saying so of either, that I would pronounce no farther therein, then this, That God hath Immediately imprinted in mans Nature and Reason, to be subiect to a power immediately infus'd from him; and that hee hath enlightned our Nature and Reason, to digest and prepare such a forme, as may bee aptest to doe those things, for which that Power is infus'd; which are, to conserue vs in Peace and in Religion: And that since the establishing of the Christian Church, he hath testified abundantly, that Regall Authoritie, by subordination of Bishops is that best and fittest way to those ends.

                        bert. Eccles. l. 2. cap. 5.3 So that, that which a Iesuite said of the Pope, That the Election doth onely present him to God, wee say also of a King; That whatsoeuer it be, that prepares him, and makes his Person capable of Regall Iurisdiction, that onely presents him to God, who then inanimates him with this Supremacy immediately from himselfe, according to a secret and tacite couenant, which he hath made with mankinde, That when they out of rectified Reason, which is the Law of Nature, haue begot such a forme of Gouernement, he will infuse this Soule of power into it.
               4 The way therefore to finde, what Obedience

is due to a King, is not to seeke out, how they which are presum'd to haue transferr'd this power into him, had their Authoritie, and how much they gaue, and how much they retain'd; For in this Discouerie none of them euer went farther, then to Families; In which, they say, Parents and Masters had Iurisdiction ouer Children, and Seruants; and these Families concurr'd to the making of Townes, and trans
                     •
                  err'd their power into some Gouernour ouer them all.
               5 But, besides that this will not hold, because such Sauadges as neuer rais'd Families, or such men as an ouerburdned kingdom should by lot throw out, which were peeces of diuers families, must haue also a power to frame a forme of Gouernement, wheresoeuer they shall reside, which could not bee if the onely roote of Iurisdiction were in parents & masters; This also will infirme and ouerthrow that Assertion, that if parents and masters had not this supreme Soueraignty, which is requisite in Kings, they could not transferre it into Kings, and so Kings haue it not from them: And if they were Soueraignes they cold not transfer it, 
                     •
                  or no Soueraigne can deuest himselfe of his Supremacie.
               6 Regall authority is not therefore deriued from men, so, as at that certaine men haue lighted a King at their Candle, or transferr'd certaine Degrees of Iurisdiction into him: and therefore it is a cloudie and muddie search, to offer to trace to the

first roote of Iurisdiction, since it growes not in man. For, though wee may goe a steppe higher then they haue done which rest and determine in Families, which is, that in euery particular man considered alone, there is found a double Iurisdiction of the soule ouer the body, and of the reason ouer the appetite, yet those will be but examples and illustrations, not Rootes and Fountaines, from which Regall power doth essentially proceede. Sepulueda, whom I cited before, saies well to this purpose;
                     De regn. & reg. offi. l. 1. 
                  That the soule doth exercise, Herile Imperium vpon the body: and this can be no example to Kings, who cannot animate and informe their Subiects as the soule doth the body. But the power of our reason vpon our appetite, is, as he saies pertinently, Regale Imperium; and Kings rule subiects so as reason rules that.
               7 To that forme of Gouernement therof for which rectified reason, which is Nature, common to all wise men, dooth iustly chuse, as aptest 
                     •
                  o worke their end, God instils such a power as we wish to be in that person, and which wee beleeue to be infused by him, and therefore obey it as a beame deriued from him, without hauing departed with any thing from our selues.
               8 And as to the end of this power, is alwaies one and the same, To liue peaceably and religiously, so is the power it self though it be diuersly complexioned, and of different stature; for that naturall light

and reason, which acknowledges a necessity of a Superiour, that we may enioy peace, and worshippe God, did consent in the common wish and tacite praier to God, and doth rest in the common faith and beliefe, that God hath powred into that person all such authority as is needefull for that vse; Therefore of what complexion soeuer the forme of gouernement be, or of what stature soeuer it seeme, yet the same authority is in euery Soueraigne State: thus farre, That there are no Ciuill men, which out of rectified Reason haue prouided for their Peaceable and religious Tranquility, but are subiect to this regall authority, which is, a p

                  ad auoided, as vve spake off before, should create a King, and

reserue to themselues a libertie to reuenge their owne wrongs, vpon one another, or to doe any act necessary to that end, for which a King hath his authority, this liberty were swallowed in their first acte, and onely the creation of the King were the worke of rectified reason, to which God had concurr'd, and that reseruation a uoide and impotent act of their appetite.
               12 If then this giue vs light, what and whence the Kings Iurisdiction is; we may also discerne by this, what our obedience must be: for power and subiection are so Relatiue, as since the King commaunds in all things conducing to our Peaceable and Religious being, wee must obey in all those. This therefore is our first Originary, naturall, and Congenite obedience, to obey the Prince: This belongs to vs as we are men; and is no more changed in vs, by being Christians, then our Humanity is changed: yet hath the Romane Church extolled and magnified three sorts of Obedience, to the preiudice of this.
               13 The first is, that which they call Caecam obedientiam: which is an inconsiderate & vndiscoursed, and (to vse their owne word) an Indiscreete surrendring of themselues, which professe any of the rules of Religion, to the command of their Prelate and Superior; by which, like the vncleane beasts, They swallow,

of them, who applie themselues to that course of life, cannot be of so great authority and obligations, as the other which is naturall, and borne in vs; and therefore, farther then it agrees with that; it is not out of rectified reason.
               14 And though it seeme scarce worthy of any further discourse, yet I cannot deny my selfe the recreation of suruaying some examples of this blinde and stupid obedience, and false humility, nor forbeare to shew, that by their magnifying thereof, and their illations thereupon, not only the offices of mutuall society are vncharitably pretermitted, but the obedience to Princes preiudic'd and maimed, and the liuely and actiue, and vigorous contemplation of God clouded and retarded.

               22 Any resolution which is but new borne

in vs, must bee abandon'd and forsaken, when that obedience which is borne with vs, is requir'd at our hands. In expressing of which trueth, Saint Bernard goes so exceeding farre,

So earnest is that deuoute father, to illustrate our Blessed Sauiours obedience, to a iurisdicton which was Naturally Superiour to him. And therefore this submission, by our owne Election, to another Superiour, cannot derogate from the Prince, nor infirme his Title to our Alleageance or obedience.

               24 Certainely the inestimable benefits which wee receiue from the Church, who feedes vs with the Word and Sacraments, deserues from vs an

humble acknowledgement, and obedient confidence in her: yea, it is spirituall Treason, not to obey her. And as in temporall Monarchies, the light of nature instructs euery man generally, what is Treason, that is, what violates or wounds or impeaches the Maiestie of the State, and yet he submits himselfe willingly to the Declaration and Constitutions, by which somethings are made to his vnderstanding Treason, which by the generall light he apprehended not to be so dangerous before; So in this case of spirituall Treason, which is Heresie, or Schisme, though originarily, and fundamentally, the Scriptures of God informe vs, what our subiection to the Church ought to be, yet we are also willing to submit our selues to the lawes and decrees of the Catholique Church her selfe, what obedience is due to her. He therefore that can produce out of eyther of these Authentique sorts of Records, Scripture, or Church, that is, Text or Glosse, any law, by which it is made either High Treason, Heresie, not to beleeue, that in my baptisme I haue implied a confession, That the Bishop of Rome is so monarch of the Church, that he may depose Princes; or petit Treason, that is Schisme, to adhere to my naturall Soueraigne against a Bull of that Bishop, shall drawe me into his mercy, and I will aske Pardon, where none is graunted, at the Inquisition.
               
               25 Else it is most reasonable (and that is euer

most religious) to relie vpon this, That obedience to Princes is taught by Nature, and affirm'd and illustrated by Scriptures. If the question be, how much this obedience must be, I must say, all, till it be proued, either that Peaceable and religious being be not all the ends, for which we are placed in this world, or that the authority of Kings, exercised by the Kings of Israell and the Christian Emperours, is not enough to performe these endes. For, to say that a King cannot prouide for meanes of saluation of soules, because he cannot preach, nor administer the Sacraments, hath as much weakenesse, as to say, hee cannot prouide for the health of a City, because he cannot giue physicke.
               26 Till then, I shal be deterr'd from declining to this second obedience, by the contemplation of many inconueniencies, and impieties resulting from thence; first, by the vastnes of that Iurisdiction: For since they haue taught vs to say so,

                  Tannerus the Iesuit saies, If Princes had their authority immediately from God, yet the Pope might restraine that authority of theirs,

                  that it should fall onely vpon Lay-men: For, saies another, He may take from

the Emperour, all his Iurisdiction, therefore any part thereof. And as many as will (saies Bellarmine) may without the consent of their Prince,

                  yea though he resist it, thus deuest their Allegeance, as they might resist their parents if they should hynder them.
               
               29 And in contemplation of this Vniuersall Iurisdiction, which might be, if it be not, in the Pope;
                     Tannerus l. 2. c. 12, in fine:
                   the Iesuite whom we first named, breakes out into this, congratulation: If at this instant all the Princes and all their subiects, would enter into Religion, and transferre all that they had into the Church, would it not bee a most acceptable spectacle to God, and Angels, and Men? Or (as he saies before) if their estates were so transferr'd to the Church, though not their persons, could not Ecclesiastique Princes rule and gouerne all these lay men, as well as they doe some others already? But because, as hee doubts in that place, Hoc in aeternum nunquam fiet, that all Laymen will come vnder them, they haue prouided that all Clergie men which be vnder them, shall be safe enough,
                     De Institut. l. 1: c: 10 as welll by way of Counsell (for so Mariana modefies his Doctrine, that the Prince should not execute any Clergy man,
                     Aphor. confes. verb. clericus
                   though hee deserue it) as by positiue way of Aphorismes, as Emanuel Sâ doth, That they are not subiects, nor can doe treason: and by way of Fact, and publique troubling the peace of al Christendome, as appeared by their late attempt vppon Venice for this Exemption.
               
                  30 And as the immensnesse of this power auerts me from beleeuing it to bee iust, so doeth this also decline me, that they will not bee brought to tell vs, How he hath it, nor How hee got it. For as yet they doe but stammer, and the Word stickes in their iawes, and wee know not whether, when it comes, it wil be Directly, or Indirectly. And they are as yet but surueying their Euidence; they haue ioyn'd no issue; nor know we whether they will pleade Diuine Law, that is, places of Scripture, or Sub diuine Law, which is interpretation of Fathers, or super diuine law, which is Decretals of Popes. But Kings insist confidently, and openly, and constantly vpon the law of Nature, and of nations, & of God, by all which they are appointed what to do, and enabled to do it,
               31 Lastly, this infames and makes this Iurisdiction suspicious to me, to obserue what vse in their Doctrine and Practise they make of this power. For when they haue proceeded to the execution of this Temporall power, it hath beene either for their owne reall and direct profit and aduantage, as in their proceeding with the Easterne Emperours: And drawing the French Armies into Italy, and promouing and strengthning the change of the family and race of the Kings in France, or else the benefit hath come to them by whose aduancement that Church growes and encreases, as in the disposing of the Kingdome of Nauarre; Or

at least, the example and terrour thereof magnifies the dignitie, and reputation of that Church, and facilitates her other enterprises, for a good time after, as a Shippe that hath made good way before a strong winde, and vnder a full Sayle, will runne a great while of her selfe, after shee hath stricken saile.
               32 VVhen any of these reasons inuite them, how small causes are sufficient to awake and call vp this temporall Authoritie? The cause why Childerique was deposed,15. q. 6. Alius.
                   was not, sayes the Canon, for his Iniquities; but because he was Inutilis. And this was not, sayes the Glosse, because hee was Insufficient, for then hee should haue an assistant, and coadiutor; but because hee was Effeminate. So that the Pope may depose vpon lesse cause, then hee can giue an assistant. For to bee Insuficient for the Gouernement, is more directly against the office of a King, then to bee subiect to an infirmitie, which concernes his humanitie, not his office.
               33 And when the officers and Commissioners of the Romane Court, come to Syndicate Kings, they haue already declar'd, what they will call Enormities and Excesses,

                   by inuoluing almost all faults, whether by Committing or Omitting in generall words; As, When he doeth not that for which he is instituted; when he vseth his prerogatiue without iust cause, when he vexes his Subiects; when he permits Priests to kisse his hands; when he proceeds indiscreetly,

and without iust reason; And lastly, For any such hunting as they will call intemperate. To which purpose they cite against Kings generally those Canons which limit certaine men, and times, and maners: And which, as the Glosse sayes of some of them,

                   are meant De venatione arenaria, When men out of vaine-glorie, or for gaine, fought in the Theaters with wild beasts. And least any small errour in a King might escape them, they make account that they haue enwrapp'd and pack'd vp all in this, That it is all one,

                  whether a King bee a Tyrant, or a Foole, or Sacrilegious, or Excommunicate, or an Hereticke.
               
               34 This obedience therfore which we neither find written in the tables of our Hearts, nor in the Scriptures, nor in any other such Record, as either our aduersary wilbe tried by, or can bind vs, must not destroy nor shake that obedience which is Naturall and Certaine.
                  
                     In Io. l. 12. c. 56. 
                  Cyril hath made this sentence his owne, by saying it with such allowance, It is wisely said, That hee is an impious man, which sayes to the King, thou dost vniustly. Much more may wee say it of any, that affirmes a King to bee naturally impotent, to doe those things for which he is instituted; as he is, if he cannot preserue his Subiects in Peace and Religion, which the Heathen kings could doe; whose Subiects had a Religion, and Ministers thereof, who wrought vpon men to incline them to Morall goodnesse here,

and to the expectation of future blessednesse after death, though not by so cleare nor so direct waies as Christian Religion doth.
               35 The king therefore defends the Liberties of the Church, as the nature of his office, which he hath acknowledged, and Declar'd, and seal'd to his Subiects by an Oath, binds him to do, if he defend the Church of England from foraine vsurpation. And a most learned and equall man hath obserued well,

               36 To recollect therefore now, and to determine & end this point, the title which the Prince hath to vs by Generation, and which the Church hath by Regeneration, is all one now. For we a

                  e not onely Subiects to a Prin

                  e, but Christian Subiects to a Christian Prince, and members as well of the Church as of the Common-wealth, in which the Church is. And as by being borne in his Dominions, and of parents in his alleageance, we haue by birth-right interest in his lawes and protection: So by the Couenant of Almighty God to the faithful and their Seede, by being born of Christian Parents, we haue title to the Sacraments; which the king (to whom, as all the kingdome is his house, so al the Clergy are chaplaines) ta

               37 Nor dooth the king and the Church direct vs to diuers ends, one to Tranquility, the other to Saluation, but both concurre in both: For wee cannot ordinarily be saued (which seemes to be the function of the Clergy) without the exercise of morall vertue here in this life, nor can Christians do those morall vertues (which seeme to bee the Princes businesse) without faith, and keeping the

right way to saluation, because a Christian must doe them Christianly.
               
               38 For though Theologall vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, are infus'd from God, yet all religious worshippe of God is morall vertue. As therefore the office of all Heathen Princes, was to conserue their subiects in the practise of morall vertue, so farre as it was reuealed to their vnderstanding; So is it now the office of Christian Princes to doe the same. For God hath now so farre enlightned vs to the vnderstanding of morall vertue, that we see thereby, that after God hath infused Faith, wee make sure our saluation, by a morall obedience to the kings Gouernement, and to their Ministery whō his prouidence appoints ouer vs for our instruction. So that Christiā
                   subiects need no higher power then kings are naturally indued and qualified withall, to direct them to Saluation; but
                     •
                   because morall vertue is now extended, not in it selfe, but

                  rection, as morall vertue reaches now; and Ministers, that may teach vs how farr that is, and to conserue vs in the obseruation therof: For as, when all things are in such sort wel composed and establ

                  shed, and euery subordinate Wheele set in good order, we are guilty of our owne damnation,

if wee obey not the Minister, and the Minister is guilty of it, if hee neglect to instruct vs, so is the Prince guilty of our spirituall ruine, and eternall perishing, if hee doe not both prouide able men to giue vs spirituall foode, and punish both their negligence and our transgressions: So that hee is to account to GOD for our soules, and therefo
                     •
                  e must haue naturall meanes to discharge that duety well, or else could not be subiect to such a reckoning for his transgressions therein.
               39 The last Obedience which I intimated, as preiudiciall to this of kings, is that which the Iesuites vowe to the Pope; which is not the same blind Obedience, which I spoke of before for the Iesuits sweare that also to their Superiours, before they come to the perfection of this: But, as that is blinde out of darkenesse, so this is blinde out of dazeling. For they must be instruments in matters of State, and disposing kingdomes.
               40 When some Priests in England were examined, what they would thinke of the Oath of Alleageance, if the pope should pronounce that it were to be held De fide, that hee might depose Princes, they desired to be spared, because they could not pronounce De futuris Contingentibus. But these votaries, the Iesuites are not so scrupulous; They can resolue to execute whatsoeuer he shall commaund: perchance they thinke the Pope so much

God, (for Iesuites must exceede in euerything) that in him, as in GOD, there can bee no Contingency. And therefore vowing their trauell and labour, to the corrupting and aliening of subiects, to the combustion or translation of Kingdomes, to the auiling and eradication of Princes, they do not vow De futuris Contingentibus, but of things euer constantly resolued in the Decree, and Counsell, and purpose of the Bishop of Rome.

                   yet in respect of his Master, who was one, I wonder he durst say, That the Iesuites made no other vow of obedience to the Pope, then other religious Orders did; which is such an excuse in their behalf, as no accusation could offend them so much; since their ambition is to serue the Pope by a neerer Obligation then the rest: which appeares euidently enough, in the Bul of Paul the third, where this fourth vow is repeated.
               42 And is it not a stange precipitation to vow their helpe to all his errours? of which they confesse he may commit many in matter of Fact, by mis-information. So that they sweare to execute that, which they are not bound to beleeue to be well commaunded: yea they are not bound to beleeue, that he which commaunds them, is that person whose commaundements by their vow they a

                     •
                  tances, which annuls them. For if they could be certaine, that the Election were free from all other corruptions, yet that Decretall in the Septimes,
                  
                     Li. 1. To. 3. c. 1. of Simoniacall Election, must of necessitie keepe all indifferent men in continuall anxietie and perplexitie. For, if any thing by any Cardinall, were giuen, or promis'd before, though the Election be by way of Assumtion and Adoration, when all concurre in it, which they call, Viam spiritus Sancti, and therefore not subiect to errour, Yet there is a Nullitie in this Election, and the holy Ghosts confirmation workes nothing vpon it, And the Person elected, hath neither spirituall nor temporall Iurisdiction, but looses all the dignities which he had before, and becomes incapable euer after; And no subsequent Act
                        •
                      of Inthroning, Oathes of Obedience by the Cardinalls, nor possession, though of long time, can make it good: And euen those Cardinals, which were parties to the Simony, may at any time after, depart frō his obedience, & all the rest of the Cardinals, which do not, forfeit their dignities.
               
               43 It is scarce possible to bee hoped, that in Elections there should be no degrees of that corruption, which this Decree labors to preclude, & which, it takes knowledg, to be so clandestine, and secretly caried, that comming to the point of annulling all those promises which were so made

                   your Law expresses it thus, Cum quauis Inexcogitabili

                  ance it will not make voide all his Acts, for some ciuill and conuenient reasons, doth yet show the iniustice, and indiscretion of such a vowe, as binds the Votarie to doe some acts, which were not lawfull for him to doe, except an assured Authoritie of the commander did warrant it.
               44 And if that measure which Aquinas gaue before of Blind obedience,
                  22. e. q. 104. Art. 5. ad 3m. must also serue in this, which is; That they must obey in all things, which belong to their Regular conuersations, that is, In all things to which their Rule, and Vowe obliges them, then as no Sea can wall any kingdome against their entrance: So no watchfulnesse can arme any brest against their violence, since the increasing of that Monarchie which they must aduance, growes from the decay of others.

The most that it can worke, is an Assurance, that they which are publiquely canonized are true Saints: for Bellarmine saies, That it is the opinion of Heretiques, that the Pope can erre in such Canonizations:

                   and yet, to proue it, he argues but thus: If we beleeue that there was such a man as Caesar, why should we not beleeue that which God testifies by miracles? But how shall wee beleeue that these miracles are from God, or that he doth them in testimony of that mans sanctity? For that miracles are done, is not enough to constitute a Saint,

                  nds, then Historicall, and such as assures vs, that Caesar was, to ground Inuocation of Saints, and to constitute an Heresie.
               
               4 And though not in Bellarmine, yet in the Pope himselfe, there appeare some scruples of diffidence, and frailty, and fallibility in this acte of Canonizing,
                  
                     Ceremon. Sacrae. Cap. de Canoniz.
                   because, after all his seuerall Inquisitions and searches which depend vpon matter of Fact, and after his diuers iteration of prayers, That hee may not erre, and That hee may not be permitted to erre, hee makes at last a publique protestation, That he intends not by that act, to do any thing against Faith.
               
               5 But if this can be certaine, That those, and none but those, which are so Canonized, may be publiquely Honoured as Saints, yet that disease, of which we spoke before, is not cured hereby. For it is still lawfull priuately to worshippe any, of whose sanctity I haue an opinion. Nor is this priuate worship,
                     De Purgat. c. 10. §. 1. so priuate in Bellarmines account, that it may not bee exhibited before others; but onely so priuate as it may not be done, In the name of the Church, and as though it were instituted by the Church. So that whole Multitudes, and Congregations may erre still: and this, by the authority of the Canon it selfe. For thus Bellarmine reasons, with more detortion and weakenesse then becomes

the cause or his grauity:

                  In the two Canons, saies he, Audiuimus, and Cum ex eo, the Pope forbiddes publique worshippe; and therefore, a Contrario, permits priuate. If then, that worshippe which in those two Canons he forbiddes to be publiquely exhibited, may priuately be giuen, and this priuatenesse exclude not whole Congregations, then whole Congregations may lawfully worshippe as a Saint, a man slaine in drunkennesse, which is the case of the first Canon, and lawfully worshippe venall and vncertaine Reliques, which is in the second Canon; since the forbidding of this in publique, hath permitted it in this large and open priuate, by Bellarmines

                  or this, That the Doctors doe commonly affirme it.
               
               6 And whatsoeuer is said heere of Saints, holdes as well in Martyres, for with the same faith, that I beleeue a man to be a martyre, I beleeue him to be a Saint: And so, it seemes, doth that Catholique Priest, who hath lately published a History of English Martyres: For that which in the Title he calls Martyrologe, in his Aduertisement he calles Sanctiloge. And therefore it becomes both our Religion and Discretion, to consider thoroughly the circumstances of their History, whom we admit to the honour of Martyrdome.
               7 All Titles to martyrdome seeme to me to be grounded vpon one of these three pretences, and

claymes. The first is, to seale with our bloode the profession of some morall Truth, which though it be not directly of the body of the Christian faith, nor expressed in the Articles thereof, yet it is some of those workes, which a Christian man is bound to doe. The second is, to haue maintained with losse of life, the Integrity of the Christian faith, and not to suffer any part thereof to perish or corrupt. The third is, to endeuour by the same meanes to preserue the liberties and immunities of the Church.
               8 By the first way they entitle S. Iohn Baptist because he died for reprehending a fault against a morall Truth: and that truth being resisted, the Authour of truth is despised: And therefore all truth is not matter conuenient for the exercise of this vertue, as the conclusions of Artes and Sciences, though perfectly and demonstratiuely true, are not; but it must be such a truth, as is conuersant about Christian piety, and by which God may be glorified: which cannot be, except he might be iniured by the denying thereof. So, the Euangelist when our Sauiour spake of S. Peters Martyrdome saies,
                     Ioh. 21.19. 
                  He signified by what death hee should glorifie God: For all Martyredome workes to that end. And this first occasion of martyrdome seldome fals out in Christian Countries, because in Christ, the great Mirrour of all these truthes, we see them distinctly and euidently. But sometimes with Heathen Princes, before they arriue to this rich and

pregnant knowledge, men which labour their conuersion, begin, or touch by the way, some of these Morall dueties; and if they grow odious, and suffer for that, they are perfect Martyrs, dying for a morall Trueth, and in the way to Christ.
               9 By the second claime, which is the Integritie of Catholicke Religion, the professors of any Christian Church, will make a specious, and apparant Title, if they suffer persecution in any other Christian Church. For the Church of Rome will call the whole totall body and bulke of the points of their profession, Integritie of Religion, and the Reformed Churches call, soundnesse, puritie, and incorruptnesse, integritie. The Roman thinkes Integritie hurt by nothing but Maimes, and we, by Diseases. And one will prooue by his death, that too little is professed, and the other, that too much. But this aduantage we haue, that by confession of our aduersaries, all that wee affirme, is True, and Necessarie: and vpon good ground we assure our selues, that nothing else is so, and we thinke that, a propensenesse to die, for profession of those points, which are not necessarie, will not constitute a Martyrdome, in such a person especially as is of necessarie vse.
               10 Amongst other things which our Blessed Sauiour warnes his followers, this is one, That none of them suffer as a busie body in other mens matters,
                  1. Pet. 4.15. 
                  but if he suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed,

but glorifie God. And in another place, hee cals them blessed: If others say all maner of euill of them, falsely, and for his sake.
                  
                     Matth. 5.11. So that the prohibition forbids vs, to suffer for those things which doe not certainely appertaine to vs; And the instruction ties the reward to these conditions, That the imputations be false, That they be imputed for Christs sake, that is, to dishonour him, and that we suffer because we are Christians.
               
               11 Since therefore some of you, at your Executions, and in other conferences, haue added this to your comfo
                     •
                  t, and glory of Martyrdome, That because the Kings mercie hath beene offred you, if you would take the Oath, therefore you died for refusing the same, (Though your Assertion cannot lay that vpon the State, who hath two discharges; One, that you were condemn'd for other Treasons, before that off
                     •
                  r; The other, that the Oath hath no such Capitall clause in it) yet since, as I said, you take it vpon your Consciences to bee so; Let vs Examine, whether your refusall of the Oath, bee a iust cause to Die, vpon this point of Integritie of Faith, by that measure which our Sauiour gaue in his Prohibition, and in his Instruction.
               
               12 Is it then any of your matters, or doeth it belong to you, by your Doctrine, and by your Example, in refusing the Oath, to determine against Princes Titles, or Subiects Alleageance? If this be any of your matters, then you are not sent onely to

doe Priestly functions; And if it be not, then you suffer as busie bodies in other mens matters, if you suffer for the Oath.
               13 And then, what is imputed to you, which is false (which is another condition required by Christ) if you be called traytors then, when after apparant transgressing of such lawes as make you Traytors, you confirme to vs a perseuerance in that Trayterous disposition, by refusing to sweare Temporall Alleageance? Wherein are you lesse subiect to that name, then those Priestes which were in Actuall plots, since mentall Treason denominates a man as well as mentall heresie? You neither can nor will condemne any thing in them, but that they did their treason, before any Resolution of the Church: and haue you any resolution of the Church, for this, That the King may be deposed, when he is excommunicated? If you haue, you are in a better forwardnesse then they, and you may vndertake any thing, as soone as you will, that is, as soone as you can. For you haue as good opinions already, and as strong authorities, That a King of another Religion then Romane, is in the state of an excommunicate person, before Sentence, as you haue for this, That an Excommunicate King may be deposed; And would you thinke it a iust cause of Martyrdome, to auerre, that the King is already vnder excommunication?
               14 And (to proceede farther in Christs Instruction)

are these things said of you for Christs sake? Are you (if you be called Traytors for refusing the Oath) reproued for anie part of his Commandements? If it were for exercising your Priestlie functions, you might haue some colour, since all your Catholique Religion, must bee the onely Christian Religion. But can that state which labours watchfullie and zealouslie for the promouing of Christs glorie in all other things, bee saide to oppose Christ, or persecute him in his Members, for imputing trayterous inclinations to them, who abhorre to confirme their Alleageance by a iust Oath?
               15 Lastly, can you say, you suffer as Christians, that is (as Christ there intended) for Christian faith, which is principally the matter of Martyrdome? Aquinas cites this,22 c. q. 124. Art. 2. ad 1m. out of Maximus, The Catholique faith is the mother of martyrdome. And he explicates it thus, That though martyrdome be an act of fortitude, and not of faith, yet as a ciuill man will be valiant to defend Iustice, as the Obiect of his valour, so doth a Martyr, faith. If then to refuse this Oath, be an obiect for a Martyrs fortitude, it must be because it opposes some point of faith, and faith is that, which hath beene beleeued euer, and euery where; And how can that be so matter of faith, which is vnder disputation, and perplexitie with them, and the contrarie whereof we make account, that we see by the light of Nature and Scriptures, and all

meanes conducing to a diuine and morall certitude?
               16 Leo the first,
                     Epist. 24. in an Epistle to the Emperour, by telling what hath beene, informes 
                     •
                  ummarilie and soundly, what should be a iust cause of Martyrdome. None of the Martyrs, saies he, had any other cause of their suffering, but the confession of the true Diuinitie, and true humanitie in Christ. And this was then the Integritie of faith, in both acceptations; All, and sound. Which is neither impaired in the extent, nor co
                     •
                  rupted in the puritie, by any thing proposed in the Oath.
               17 But as Chrysostome expounding that place of Ieremie,
                  
                     In Marc. Hom. 13. To. 2. fo. 270 
                  Domus Dei facta est spelunca Hyaenae, applies it to the Priests of the Iewes, as hardest of all, to be conuerted, so may we apply it to the Priests of the Romanes, who abhor the Oath, and deter their Schollers. For, the Hyena, saies Chrysostome, hath but one backe bone, and cannot turne except it turne all at once. So haue these men, one back bone, the Church; (for so saies Bellarmine, if we were a greed of that, we should soone be at an end:) and this Church is the Pope; And they cannot turne, but all at once, when he turnes; and this is the Integritie of the faith they talke of. And, as that Father, addes of the Hyena, Delectantur cadaueribus; they are delighted with impious prouocations to the effusion of bloud, by suggesting a false and imaginarie martyrdome.
               
                  18 The third and last iust ground of martyrdome, of those which we mentioned, is Ecclesiastique Immunitie, which is of two sorts; one inhaerent, and Natiue, and connaturall to the Church, and the other, Accessory, and such, as for t
                     •
                  e furtherance and aduancement of the worship of God, Christian Princes, in performing a religious dutie, haue afforded and established. Of the first sort are, preaching the word, administring the Sacraments, and applying the Medicinall censures. And if any, to whose charge God hath committed these, by an ordinarie calling, loose his life in the execution thereof, with Relation to the cause, we may iustly esteeme him a martyr. And so in the second kinde, if onely for a pious and dutifull admonition to the Prince, to continue those Liberties to the Church, without which she cannot wel doe her offices, hee should incurre a deadly displeasu
                     •
                  e, he were also a Martyr.
               
               19 And if the Romane Priests could transferre vpon themselues this title to Martyrdome, due to defenders of either of these Immunities, yet by refusall of this Oath, which is an implied affirming of some doct
                     •
                  ine contrarie to it, they forfait that interest by ob

                  ruding, as matter of Ch
                     •
                  istian faith, that which is not so: For Baronius himselfe (as once before wee had occasion to say) distinguishes the defence of the liberties of the Church, from the Catholique faith; and yet he and many

others, makes the defence of these immunities the obiect of Martyrdome: so various and vncertaine is the doctrine of defending those priuiledges, whose ground and foundation they cannot agree vpon.
               20 And as all right to the crowne of Martyredome, growing from any of these three titles, perishes by their refusal, for the reasons before expressed: so doth it also vpon this ground, that hee which refuses to defend his life by a lawfull acte, and entertaines not those ouertures of escape, which God presents him, destroies himselfe, especially if his life might be of vse and aduantage to others. For when the Prison was opened to Paul and Silas,
                  
                     Acts 16. the learned Expositors excuse his stay there, by no other way, then that it appeares, that he had a reuelation of Gods purpose, that he should conuert the Keeper; for otherwise not to haue hastened his escape, had beene to abuse Gods mercie by not vsing it.
               21 Those lawes from which these conclusions are deduced,
                     Par. Put. Syndic. fol. 484. 
                  that if a man receiue a Corporall iniurie, and remit the offence, yet the state may pursue it against the trespasser, because no man is Lord of himselfe: and that a couenant from a man, that if you finde him in your ground you may beate him, is voide vpon the same reason, Intimate thus much to this purpose, That no man by lawe of nature may deliuer himselfe into a danger which he might auoide.
               
                  22 How many actes of good and meritorious nature, if they had all due circumstances, haue beene vitiated by Indiscretion, and changed from nourishment to poison?

                  lfe, then to die in despite of such a Princes mercie, as at once directs him to vnderstand his duety to himselfe, and to his Prince: and shewes him, that his owne preseruation is a naturall duety; and that hee may not neglect it in any cause, but where it appeares euidently, Catholiquely, and indisputably (amongst them to whose instruct

               25 And since, if the King would pardon him, vpon doing of any act, which depended vpon his owne will, he were guiltie of his death, if hee refused it, he is so also in this case, since he can propose to himselfe no such restraint as binds his wil; For scruples, and things in Opinion and Disputation, do not binde in this c

In punishment of which vncharitablenesse, he lost his whole hope and victorie: For the spirit of God forsooke him, and he Apostated from his Faith: So that Charitie is iustly esteem'd the forme of Martyrdome.
               27 And is there any Charitie in this Doctrine, or in this act of Refusall? Is there any to your self? (For, at least in spiritualibus, Charitie begins at home) when at once you diuorce that body which your Parents prepar'd, from that Soule which God infused and married to it: and so lea

of Merit, euen in aduancing the Catholique cause, which to you is so certaine, doe you loose, by exposing your selfe to certaine ruine, vpon vncertaine foundations? Is there any charitie to the Church, or partie, or faction, which you haue in this Kingdom? towards whom the King brought with him so much tendernesse, that hee cast in a dead sleepe all bloudy lawes, and in a slumber all pecuniarie lawes which might offend, & aggrieue them. Is it charitably done towards them, that by your vnnecessarie act, their peace be interrupted, his Maiesties sweetnesse distasted, his softnesse indured, and those faire impressions which hee had admitted, That ciuill obed

               30 I doe not thinke that they would haue denied him to haue beene a Martyr, if he had beene executed vpon the Statute against Priests, though he had before taken the oath. If therefore the taking of the oath cannot vitiate and annull martyrdome, the

                  que Faith, but for that Title you had also the consonance and agreement of all the Romane Church. And for your second claim, which is, the defence of the Popes temporall Iurisdiction, by refusing this oath, you had some voices of great authority in that Church, to encourage you, though farr too weak, either to blot out a naturall truth, or to make an indifferent, or perplex'd point so necessary to you, as to dy for it. But for this third title to martyrdome, which arises frō obedience to the Breues, which are matters of fact, & subiect to a thousand infi

                  mities & nullities, who euer iustly grounded a necessity of dying, vpon thē, or added the comfort of martyrdome to such a precipitatiō?
               32 Thus dooth Aquinas argue against a farre better Title to martyrdome, then this is: Though virginity be more pretious then life,

Yet he assignes not the reason to be, because she died not, but because Martyrdome is a testimony, by which it is made euident to all, that the Martyres loue Christian faith aboue all things, and it cannot appeare by this act of hers, whether she suffer this for the loue of Christian faith, or for contempt of chastitie. But in this acte of dying for obedience to the Breues, there is by many degrees lesse manifestation, that they die for Christian Faith, which is not in question; and there appeare euident impressions of humane respects, which would vitiate a better title to martyrdome, and of such vnnatural dereliction of themselues, as I doe not see how they could escape being selfe-murderers, but that their other

That there hath beene as yet no fundamentall and safe ground giuen, vpon which, those which haue the faculties to heare Confessions, should informe their owne Consciences, or instruct their penitents; That they are bound to aduenture the heauie and Capitall penalties of this Lawe, for refusall of this Oath. And that if any Man haue receiued a scruple against this Oath, which he cannot depose and cast off, the Rules of their own Casuists, as this case stands, incline, and warrant them, to the taking thereof.

Since, I say, by refusall thereof, both the Catholickes lay a heauie scandal, and dangerous aspersions vpon the cause, and declare themselues more slauish to the Pope, and consequently apter to defection from the Prince, then the Subiects of forraine States now are, or the Subiects of this Kingdome were heretofore, And also his Maiestie, and all those which affect his safetie, which not only inuolues but procures and causes theirs, may iustly encline at last to thinke, that the very ground, and principles of that Religion nourish these rebellious humours, and so finde it necessarie for preseruation of the whole bodie, to apply Medicines more corrosiue and sharpe to that member which appeares so corrupt and dangerous, And euerie Catholique in particular, to whom this Oath is offered, by re

               2 And as it is certaine, that at the first promulging of this oath, they had no such ground, nor Euidence (for then, that light must haue beene vpon them all, and so many good and earnest maintain

                  rs of that Religion, would not haue enclined to the Oath, if they had had such Euidence against it) so also after some scruples were iniected, and the tendernesse of some consciences vitiated and distracted with some doubts, and that it had beene submitted to Disputation, and consulting amongst themselues, and so passed all those furnaces of Examination, it was held lawfull, and accordingly many tooke it. So that neither by the Euident and vndeniable authoritie of Nature, or Scripture, nor by Deductions and conclusions necessarily deriued and issuing from thence, any Conscience had su

               3 If since, by some arguments of probabilitie, and of Conueniencie, or by some propositions propagated & deduced from those first principles o

               4 For, let the first roote and parent of all propositions in this matter of Obedience, be, that which we know by nature, That we must obay such a power, as can preserue vs in Peace and Religion, and that which wee find in Scr

               5 Let vs then pursue the line, of which the first end is; Kings must be obeyed. It followes, Therfore they must be able to commaund iustly; therfore

they must haue some to enable and instruct them; therefore they must doe according to their instruction; therefore if they doe not, they are subiect to their corrections; therefore if they be incorrigible, they are no longer Kings; and therefore no subiect can sweare perpetuall Obedience, to his person, who by his owne fault, and his superiours Declaration, may growe to be no King.
               6 Now, as no man can beleeue the last of these propositions, as roundly and constantly, as the first, because though it seeme to be the childe of the first, yet in it self, or in some of the meane parents by the way, there may be fallacies which may corrupt and abastard it; so is there no other certaine rule to trie it, but to returne to the first principles, and see if it consist with them. For if it destroy the first, it degenerates and rebels, and we may not adhere to it. And if the first may still consist without it, though this may seeme orderly and naturally deduced from thence, yet it imposes not so much necessity vpon vs, as the first doth; for that bindes vs peremptorily; this, as it is circumstanced and conditioned.
               7 And though these circumstances giue it all the life it hath, so that to make it obligatory, or not so, depends vpon them, yet it is impossible to discerne those circumstances, or vnentangle our consciences by any of those Rules, which their Casuists vse to giue, who to stengthen the possession

of the Romane Church, haue bestowed more paines, to reach how strongly a conscience is bound to doe according to a Scruple, or a Doubt, or an Opinion, or an Errour, which it hath conceiued, then how it might depose that Scruple, or cleare that Doubt, or better that Opinion, or rectifie that Errour.
               
               8 For, That we may at once lay open the infirmity, and insufficiency of their Rules, and apply the same to our present purpose; What vse and profite, can those Catholiques, which doubt whether they may take that Oath, make of that Rule, that they must follow in doubtfull points, that opinion which is most common and generall? For, though this be vnderstood of the opinion of such men as are intelligent and vnderstanding, and conuersant in the matter in question, yet oftentimes, amongst them, both sides say, This is the common opinion; and who can iudge it? Yea many circumstances change the common opinion:

               8 And if of late daies, The opinion of refusing the Oath, become the more common opinion, it is vpon some of these circumst

                  nees, that at these times, when Catholiques are called to professe ciuill obedience, in this place, where Iesuites are in possession of most hearts, to get reputation, or to auile secular Magistracy, they haue suddenly made it the more common: for they can raise the Exchange in an howre, and aduance and crie downe an opinion at their pleasure.
               
                  But to determine of mortall sinne (as the taking of this Oath must be, if it be matter enough to aduenture these dangers for it) the same Authour saies well,
                     Par. 1. c. 6. doth not so much appertaine, Ad pulpita Canonistarum, as it doth ad Cathedras Theologorum: and therefore it ought to be tried by the principles of Diuinity, not by the circumstanciall ragges of Casuists.
               
               But, to goe forward with them, if this Common Opinion were certaine, and if it were possible to discerne it, yet it doth not so binde vs, but that we may depart from it, when another opinion is safer: And from that opinion which is safer, wee may also in many cases depart. For which
                     •
                   those examples, which Carbo a good Summist alleages, may giue vs satisfaction, which are,
                     Summa Summarum. To. 1. par. 1. c. 14. §. Tertium.
                   
                  If I doubt of my title to land, I am not bound to restore it (though that were the safest way) because in doubtfull matters, Melior est Conditio possidentis. And, but for this helpe, I wonder with what conscience, the Catholiques keepe the possession of such landes as belong to the Church; for they cannot be without some scruples of an vniust title, and it were safest to restore thē. Another example in Carbo is, If my superior command a difficult thing, and I doubt whether he command lawfully or no, though it were safer to obey, yet I am not bound to doe so. And he giues a Rule, which will include a thousand examples, That that Rule, That the safest part is to be embraced, is then onely true, when

by following this safer part, there ensues no notorious detriment. And Soto extends this Doctrine farther, for he saies,
                     De ratio.

                      beleeue the precept of your Superior to be iust (which creates Conscientiam Opinantem) yet you may doe against it: Because (saies he) it is then onely sinne to doe against your conscience, when to do according to your conscience, is safe, and that no danger to the state, or to a third person, appeares therein. So that Tutius in a spirituall sense, that is, in a doubtfull matter rather to beleeue a thing to be sinne, then not, must yeelde to T
                        •
                     tius in a temporall sense, that is, when it may be done without notorious detriment; For when it comes to that, we shall finde it to be the common opinion of Casuists, which the same Summist deliuers, That there is no matter so waighty, wherein it is not lawfull for me, to follow an opinion that is probable, though I leaue the opinion which is more probable; yea though it concerne the right of another person: as in our case of obedience to the King or the Pope. And then, wheresoeuer I may lawfully follow an opinion to mine aduantage, if I will leaue that opinion with danger of my life or notorious losse, I am guilty of all the damage I suffer. For these circumstances make that Necessary to me then, which was indifferent before: the reasons vppon which Carbo builds this Doctrine of following a probable opinion, and leauing a more probable, which are, That no man is bound, Ad m

                  ntie of subiection to the King, and then the damages by the refusall to sweare it, they encline much more to strengthen that ciuill obedience, then that other obedience which is plainly enough claimed, by this forbidding of the Oath.

                  st notions which wee haue by the light of nature are certaine, yet late conclusions deduced from thence are not so.
               If you pretend common consent for your ground, and Criterium, by which you know this truth, and so giue it the name of Catholicke Doctrine, and say that Faith is to be bound to that, and Martyrdome to be indur'd for Faith, you must also remember, that that which is so call'd Catholicke, is not onely a common consent of all persons at one time, but of the Catholicke Church euer. For, Quod vbique, quod semper, is the measure of Catholicke Doctrine. And can you produce Authors of any elder times, then within sixe hundred yeares, to haue concurr'd in this?

               And are not they which seeme to maintaine this temporall power, so diuided amongst themselues, that in a mutinie, and ciuill dissention, they rather wound one another, then any third enemie, when they labour more, to o

And though such things as appeare to vs, euidently, and presently out of the Scriptures, binde our assent, and beleefe, though wee may dispute about the way and manner, (as no man denies the conception of our blessed Lady, though it be disputed, whether shee were conceiued with original

                  especially when he is bound in conscience not to answere, except he be his competent Iudge, as you teach when Ecclesiastique persons are called to Secular tribunals) he cannot be sure that man is his competent Iudge except he know first, whether he haue that authority, as Ordinary, or by speciall Commission. Though therefore in this point in question, for a pious credulity, and generall intention to aduance the dignity of the Church of Rome, a Catholique may haue an indigested and raw opinion, that this power is in the Pope, yet when he examines himselfe, and calls himselfe to account, he must first know how it is, before he can resolue, that it is. And though he may erre in the manner, by which he beleeeues it to be in him, yet certainely he must arest himselfe vpon some one of those waies, by which the

Pope is said to haue that Iurisdiction, or else hee doth not answere his conscience, that askes him how he knowes it? and if his conscience doe not aske him, he is in too drowsie and stupid a fit to be a Martyr.
               Since therefore all his authority must be Direct or Indirect: Ordinary or Extraordinary: as he is Pope or not as he is Pope, whosoeuer will seale with his blood the auerment of this Iurisdiction, auerres one of these waies, how it comes to him: Which being so, he cannot iustly be called a Martyr; since he only is a Martyr, whom all the Churc

And he which should die, for maintenance of Direct power, should neuer be admitted into such a Martyrologe, as the fauourers of Indirect power should compile; nor these, into the other. And if two should come to execution together, vpon occasion of denying this Oath, of which one refused it, because hee thought the Pope Direct Lorde, the other Indirect, if they forbore hard words to one another at that time, doubtlesse in their consciences they would impute to one another, the same errours, and the same falshoods, of which they inter-accuse one another in their bookes, and neither would beleeue the other to be a true Martyr. And might not a dispassioned and equal spectator apply to them both seuerally, that Rule of the law, That to that, which is forbidden to be had by one way, one may not be admitted by another?

And that, If after the Cardinals are deliuered of that feare, which possessed them at the Election, they then ratifie and confirme that Pope, yet he is no Pope, but the Election voide: So farre doeth this iust feare (which cannot be denied to bee in your case) extend, and vpon so solemne, and solid Acts, and Decrees is it able to worke, and prouide vs a iust excuse for transgressing thereof.
               And in a matter little different from our case, Azorius giues the resolution; That if an hereticall Prince commaunds his Catholicke Subiectes to goe to Church, vpon paine of death or losse of goods, if hee doe this onely because he will haue his Lawes obeyed, and not to make it Symbolum Hereticae prauitatis, nor haue a purpose to discerne therby Catholickes from Hereticks, they may obey it.

For in Capitall matters, saies your great Syndicator, it is lawfull to redeeme the life, per fas & nefas. which must not haue a wicked interpretation; and therefore must be meant, whether with, or against any humane lawes; which he speakes out of the strength and resultance of many lawes and Canons there alleadged. And therfore it can neuer come to be matter of Faith, that subiects may depart from their Prince, if this iust feare may excuse vs from obeying, as these Authors teach; for that neuer deliuers vs in matters of so strong obligation as matter of Faith, from which no feare can excuse our departing.
               To conclude therefore this Chapter, since later propositions, either Adulterine, or Suspicious, cannot haue equall authority, and credite, with the first, and radicall trueth, much lesse blot out those certaine and euident Anticipations imprinted by nature, and illustrated by Scriptures, for ciuill obedience, since the Rules of the Casuists

electing opinions in cases of Doubt, and perplexity are vncertaine and flexible, to both sides, since that Conscience, which we must defend with our liues, must be grounded vpon such things, as wee may, and doe not onely know, but know how we know them, since these iust feares of drawing scandall vpon the whole cause, and afflictions vpon euery particular Refuser, might excuse the transgression of a direct law, which had all her formalities, much more any opinions of Doctors or Canonists, I hope we may now pronounce, That it is the safest, in both acceptations, both of spirituall safety, and Temporall, and in both Tribunals, as well of conscience, as of ciuill Iustice, to take the Oath.
            
            
               CHAP. IX. That the authority which is imagined to be in the Pope, as he is spirituall Prince, of the Monarchy of the Church, cannot lay this Obligation vpon their Consciences: first because the Doctrine it selfe is not certaine, nor presented as matter of faith: Secondly because the way by which it is conueyed to them, is suspitious and dangerous, being but by Cardinall Bellarmine, who is various in himselfe, and reproued by other Catholiques of equall dignity, and estimation.
               
                  WEe may bee bold to say, that there is much iniquity, and many degrees of Tyranny, in establishing so absolute and transcendent a spiritual Monarchy,
                  
by them, who abhorre Monarchy so much, that though one of their greatest Doctors, to the danger of all Kings, say, 
                     Fran. a Victor. Relect. de potest. Ciuili. Nu. 14. 
                  That the Pope might, if hee thought it expedient, constraine all Christians to create one temporall Monarch ouer all the world: yet they allow no other Christian Monarchy vpon Earth, so pure and absolute, but that it must confesse some subiection and dependencie. The contrarie to which

                  Bellarmine saies, is Hereticall; And yet there is no Definition of the Church, which should make it so. And hereby they make Baptisme in respect of Soueraintie, to bee no better then the bodie in respect of the soule. For, as the bodie by inhaerent corruption vitiates the pure and innocent soule, so they accuse Baptisme to cast an Originall seruitude and frailtie vpon Soueraintie: which, hauing beene strong and able to doe all Kingly offices before, contracts by this Baptisme a debilitie and imperfection, and makes Kings, which before had their Lieutenancie and Vicariate from God, but Magistrates and Vicars to his Vicar, and so makes their Patents the worse by renewing & confirming.
               
               2 Nor doe they only denie Monarchie to Kings of the Earth, but they change the state and forme of gouernment in heauen it selfe; and ioyne in Commission with God, some such persons, as they are so farre from beeing sure that they are there, that they are not sure, that euer they were heere. For their excuse, that none of those inuocations

which are vsed in that Church, are so directly intended vpon the Saints, but that they may haue a lawfull interpretation, is not sufficient. For words appointed for such vses, must not only be so conditioned, that they may haue a good sense, but so, that they may haue no ill. So that to say, That God hath reserued to himselfe the Court of Iustice, but giuen to his Mother, the Court of Mercie, And that a Swertius in Epitaph. Pataui. Nulla erat in Medico spes, neque multa Deo.

               3 But for this spirituall Monarchie which they haue fansied, I thinke, that as some men haue imagined, and produced into writing, diuers Idaeas, and so sought what a King, a Generall, an Oratour, a Courtier should be, So these men haue only Idaeated what a Pope would be. For if he could come to a true and reall exercise of all that power which they attribute to him, I doubt not, but that Angell,

                  That as Christ was, so the Pope is, spirituall prince, ouer all men, and that by vertue of that power, he may dispose of all temporall things, as hee shall iudge it expedient to his spirituall ends.
               
               11 For first, against that opinion of Ordinarie Iurisdiction hee argues thus;

                  If it were so, it would appeare out of the Scriptures, or from the Tradition of the Apostles: but in the Scriptures, there is mention of the keyes of Heauen, but none of the Kingdomes of the earth; nor doe our Aduersaries offer any Apostolique Tradition. Will not you then, before you receiue

too deepe impression of Bellarmines doctrine, as to pay your liues for maintenance thereof, tell him, That if his opinion were true, it would appeare in Scripture, or Apostolique tr

                  cept his positions for his sake, without scriptures.
               12 Another of Bellarmines reasons against Ordinary Iurisdiction, is, That Regall authority was no
                        •
                      necessary nor of vse in Christ to worke his end,

                     perfluous and vnprofitable. And what greater vse, or necessity can the Pope haue of this Extraordinarie authority (which is a power to work the same effects, though not by the same way) then Christ had, if his ends be the same which Christs were? and it appeares that Christ neither had, nor forsaw vse of either, because he neither exercised nor instistuted either. For, that is not to the purpo
                     •
                  e, which Bellarmine saies, that Christ might haue exercised that power if he would,
                  
                     Ca. 4. § Vt igitur
                   since the Popes authority is grounded vpon Christs example; and limited to that: For Christ might haue done many thinges

which the Pope cannot do; as conuerting all the world at once, instituting more sacraments, and many such:
                     Ca. 3. § Gregorius.
                   and therefore Bellarmine argued well before, that it is enough for him to proue, that Christ did not exercise Regall power, nor declare himselfe to haue it which Declarion onely, and practise, must be drawen into Consequence, and be the precedent for the Pope to follow.
               16 The light of which Argument, that the Pope hath no power, but such as Christ exercised, hath brought so many of them to thinke it necessarie to proue That both Christ did exercise Regall aut

                  And that S. Peter vsed also the like power, in condemning Ananias and Saphira, and Simon Magus.
               
               14 In another place Bellarmine saies, That S. Paul appealed to Caesar,
                  
                     De pont. l. 2. c. 29. §. Respond. primo
                   
                  as to his Superiour Iudge, not onely de facto, but de Iure; and that the Apostles were subiects to the Ethnique Emperours, in all temporall causes, and that the law of Christ, depriues no man of his right, which he had before. And lately in his Recognitions he departs from this opinion, and denies that he was his Iudge, de Iure. If his first opinion be true, can these consist together, that he which is subiect in temporal causes, can at the same time and in the same causes be superiour? Or that he ouer whom the Emperour had supreame temporall

authority, should haue authority ouer the Emperour in temporall causes? and what is there in the second opinion, that should induce so strong an Obligation vpon a conscience, as to die for it; Since the first was better grounded (for, for that he produ

               15 Thus also Bellarmine argues, to our aduantage (though he doe it to proue a necessity of this power in the Church) that euery Common-wealth is sufficiently prouided in it selfe,

For, to say, that it sprong out of Spirituall Authoritie, when there was any vse of it, were to say, that that Authoritie at Christs institution had not all her perfections and maturity, and to say, that it is no other but the highest act, and a kinde of prerogatiue of the spirituall power, will not reach home

                   For you must beleeue and die in this, that the Pope as spirituall Prince, may not onely dispose of temporall matters, but that herein hee vses the temporall sword, and temporall iurisdiction.

                  esse that I know not, how to speake thereof with so much earnestnesse, as becomes a matter of so great waight. For other Princes, when they exercise their extraordinarie and Absolute power, and prerogatiue, and for the publique good put in practise sometimes some of those parts of their power,1. Sam. 8.11. which are spoken of in Samuel, (which to many men seeme to exceede Regall p

                  ) yet they professe to doe these things as they are Kings, and not by any other authoritie then that.
               
                  18 And if there be some things which the Pope cannot doe as Pope, but as chiefe spirituall Prince, this implies that there are other inferiour spirituall Princes, which are Bishops: (for so Bellarmine saies, That Bishops in their Diocesses are Ecclesiastique Princes.
                  
                     De Pont. l. 4. C. 15. §. At in.
                  ) And haue Bishops any such measure of this spirituall principality, that they may do somthings by that, which they cannot doe, as they are Bishops
                  
                     •
                  
               
               19 All Principalities maintaine their being by these two, reward, & punishment. How lame then and vnperfect is this spirituall principality, which can affoord but one halfe? For it is onely then of vse, when the Pope will punish, and correct a King, by Deposing him: for all Rewards & Indulgences in this life, and in the next, hee conferres and bestowes, as hee is Pope, and needes not this Title, to doe any good which is in his power. And for corrections and punishments, all which we are sure he can lawfully doe, which is, to inflict Church censures, vpon those who are vnder his spirituall obedience, he doth as he is Pope, and needes not this principalitie for that vse neither.
               20 But for irregular actions, and such as occasion tumult and sedition,
                     De Concil. l. 1. C. 18. §. Dico.
                   he must be a spirituall Prince. For, sayes Bellarmine, Though the Pope as he is president of a generall Councell, (and he is that, as he is Pope) ought to follow the greatest number of voyces in making Decrees
                        •
                      yet as he is chiefe Prince, hee is

not bound to doe so, but may follow the lesser number. And yet scarse constant to himselfe, he sayes, That this libertie belongs to the Pope, because he hath the assistance of the holy Ghost: Now the Pope, as Pope, hath the assistance of the holy Ghost, (for else his Determination in Ca
                     •
                  hedra, in matters of faith, were not by his Ordinarie, and Direct power,) and therefore as Pope hee may follow the fewer voyces in a Councell, and as Pope (or no way) he may depose Princes.

Which serued them to doe mischiefe enough, before this title was inuented. And to say, that they haue authoritie, as they are Popes, to doe some acts, as they are not Popes, is such a darke, and mistie, and drowsie Doctrine, as it is the fittest and most proportionall Martyrdome in this businesse, for a man to dreame that he died for it.

                   though hee impugne both these opinions, of Bellarmine, and Baronius, yet he protests, that the opinion which Bellarmine calls the Canonists opinion, is the more probable, and defensible: because, saies hee, that opinion is not against the order of Nature, that the Pope should exercise such a power, which they maintaine to be directly granted to him: but that opinion, which they call the Diuines opinion, is against Nature, since it admits the exercise of such an Authority, as is neither by name granted, nor necessarie to the ends of the Church: And therefore, saies this Catholique, though the Diuines ouerthrow the Canonists, yet they proue not their owne opinion.
                  
                     Cap. 3. in Princ. et ca. 40. And in another place he saies, That though Bellarmine haue giuen as much to the Pope, as honestly he could, and more then he should haue done, yet he was so farre from satisfying the Pope herein, that for this opinion the Pope was very neere condemning all his workes, as, saies he, the Iesuites themselues, haue tolde mee.
               
               25 VVhich disposition of enclining to the Canonists opinion, appeares still in the Popes, who accept so well the bookes of that purpose, that the greatest part of those Authors, which I haue cited in this booke, of that matter, are dedicated

to the late Popes. So that, that Doctrine, which is so much denied in the substance and Essence therof, that all wayes of the existence thereof are peremptorily denied, hath not yet receaued concoxions enow from the Church, to nourish a conscience to such a strength, as Martyrdome requires. For that, which their great Doctor Franciscus a Victoria pronounces against his direct Authoritie,

                  by any meanes, and therefore he hath it not. To which purpose he had directly said before, of the direct Authoritie, It is manifestly false, although they say that it is manifestly true; And I beleeue it to be a meere deuise, only to flatter the Popes. And it is altogether fained, without probability, Reason, Witnesse, Scripture, Father, or Diuine. Onely some Glossers of the law, poore in fortune and learning, haue bestowed this authority vpon them. And therefore, as that Ermit which was fed in the Desert by an Angell,

That the Canons can giue them no warrant, to aduenture these dangers, for this refusall: And that the reuerend name of Canons, is falsly, and cautelously insinuated, and stolne vpon the whole body of the Canon law, with a briefe Consideration vpon all the bookes thereof; and a particular suruay, of all those Canons, which are ordinarily cyted by those Authours, which maintaine this temporall Iurisdiction in the Pope.

And as with temporall Princes, the danger is come very neere his person, if the remedie lie in his guard, so is also this spirituall Prince brought to a neere exigent, if his title to depose Princes must be defended by the Canons. For, in this spirituall warre which the Reformed Churches vnder the conduct of the Holy Ghost, haue vndertaken against Rome, not to destroy her, but to reduce her to that obedience, from which at first she vnaduisedly strayed, but now stubbornly rebels against it, the Canon law serues rather to stoppe a breach, into which men vse to cast as wel straw and Feathers, as Timber and Stone, then to

maintaine a fight and battell.
               2 This I speake not to diminish the Reuerence or slacken the obligation which belongs to the ancient Canons and Decrees of the Church; but that the name may not deceiue vs;
                     Carranza. sum. Concil. fo. 92. For, as the heretiques Vrsalius, and Valens, got together a company at Nice, because they would establish their Heresies, vnder the name of a Nicene Councell, (which had euer so much reputation, that all was readily receiued, which was truely offered vnder that name) so is most pestilent and infectious doctrine, conuayed to vs, vnder the reuerend name of Ecclesiastique Canons.
               
               3 The body of the Canon law, which was called Codex Canonum, which contained the Decrees of certaine auncient Councels, was vsually produced in after-Councels for their direction, and by the intreaty of popes, admitted and incorporated into the body of the Romane and Imperiall law; and euer in all causes, wherein they had giuen any Decision, it was iudg'd according to them, after the Emperours had by such admittance giuen them that strength.
               4 And if the body of that law, were but growen and swelled, if this were a Grauidnes, & Pregnancy which she had conceiued of General Councels lawfully called, and lawfully proceeded in, and so she had brought forth children louing and profitable to the publique, and not onely to the Mother,
                  
(for how many Canons are made onely in fauour of the Canons?) all Christian Princes would be as inclinable to g
                     •
                  ue her strength, and dignity, by incorporating her into their lawes, and authorising her thereby, as some of the Emperours were. And had the Bishops of Rome maintained that purity, and integrity of Doctrine,
                     Cod. de Sum. Trinit. le. 1. Cunctos
                   and that compatiblenesse with Princes, which gaue them authority at first, when the Emperours conceiued so well of that Church, as they bound their faith to the faith thereof (which they might boldly doe at that time) perchance Princes would not haue refused, that the adiections of those later Popes should haue beene admitted as parts of the Canon law: nor should the Church haue beene pestred, and poisoned with these tumors, & excrescenges, with which it abounds at this time, and swelles daily with new additions.
               5 In which, if there bee any thinge which bindes our faith, and deriues vppon vs a Title to Martyrdome, if we die in defence thereof (as there are many things deriued from Scriptures and Obligatory Councels) the strength of that band rises so much from the nature of the thing, or from the goodnesse of the soile, from which it was transplanted to that place, that though we might be Martyrs, if we defended it in that respect, yet wee should loose that benefit, though it be an euident and Christian truth, if we defend it vpon that reason,

                  That it is by approbation of the

                     ope inserted into the body of the Canon law; which is a Satyr, and Miscellany of diuers and ill digested Ingredients.
               6 The first part whereof, which is the Decretum compiled by Gratian, which hath beene in vse aboue foure hundred yeares, is so diseased and corrupt a member thereof, that all the Medicines, which the learned Archbishop Augustinus, applied to it, and all that the seuerall Commissioners, first by Pius the fift, then by Gregory the thirteenth, haue practised vpon it, haue not brought it to any state of perfect health, nor any degree of conualescence.
               7 But though that Bishop say,
                     De Emendat. Grat. l. 1. Dial. 1. 
                  That Gratian is not worthy of many words, though in his dispraise, yet because he tels vs,

                  That the ignorant admire him, though the Learned laugh at him; And because hee is accounted so great a part of the Canon Law, as euen the Decretall Epistles of the Popes are call'd, Extra, in respect of him, as being out of the Canon Law, it shall not be amisse to make some deeper impressions of him.
               8 Thus farre therefore the Catholicke Archbishop charges him,
                     L. 2. Dial. 8. 
                  To haue beene so indiscreete and precipitate, that he neuer stood vpon Authoritie of Bookes, but tooke all, as if they had beene written with the finger of God, as certainely as Moses Tables; And hee is so well confirm'd in the opinion of his negligence, that he sayes,
                     L. 1. Dial. 4. 
                  He did not onely neuer Iudge and waigh, but neuer see the Councels nor the Registers of Popes, nor

the workes of the Fathers: And therefore sayes hee, There is onely one remedy left, which is, Vna litura.

And so the Councell layes a Commandement vpon the Clergie, but Gratian layes it vpon the Layetie.

                   then Binius, because hauing no reference at all to Gratian, hee cites the words out of the Councell it-selfe; and hauing said, That Counsell pronounces in this point more clearely, in these words; He cites the words, falsely, and corruptly as Gratian did before.

imposture, and inserted that, as a most strong Decree, all which, with the Author thereof, should rather haue beene hissed away, and pursued with execrations, which also he saies of another place in Gratian, to the same purpose;

                   whose sense he apprehended not, in the matter of mariage of Priests; for he saies, that that Canon was grounded vpon the Apostles Canons; and yet it is contrarie to the Canons of the Romane Church. So that of this place, that Archbishop of whom I spoke before, exclaimes,

               14 And not onely in matters of fact (though that be the right legge vpon which the Romane Religion, (especially in Crowne Diuinitie) doth stand) doth Gratian deceaue you, but euen in such things as are matters of faith: both naturally, and so, common to all men, As when he allowes that there may be perplexities in euill,

                   for, hauing produced authorities on both sides, whether it be necessarie or no, he leaues

it as indifferent to the Reader, to allow & choose which opinion he likes best.
               15 And because the Glosse is now by some thought, to be of equal authoritie with the Text, it is not an inconuenient way to eneruate both, by presenting some of the vanities and illusions of that. And though I will not in so serious a businesse, insist vpon such thinges, as might make sport and moue laughter, yet these few I may be excusable to let fall in this place.

Thes. 15. may be beleeued, when he saies, That those Priests which were executed vnder Queene Elizabeth, died pro inficiatione pontificatus faeminei: But their malice was not because she would haue bin a Priest, but because she would not be a Sacrifice to their Idolatry, nor Ambition; nor open her heart to their inchantments, nor her throate and sides to their poisons and swords.

               23 And thus this fat law (for so Ciuilians say of that, that it is Crassa aequitas; which is a praise beyond desert, though rhey speake it in diminution & scorn) grows daily so fast, that as any corruption can get entertainment in a grosse body, so I doubt not but this, or the next age, shall see in their Octaues and future Volumes, not onely many of their letters, yet for shame cōcealed, but at Henry the thirds death, canonized in the body of this law. For though they haue denied it with some-earnestnesse, yet they haue also confest, that if it were such as it is said to be, it admits a good interpretation.
               24 But for these bookes, though they haue more credit with them then the Decretum hath, I will ease my selfe of that labour, which I tooke in that booke, in presenting particular defects and infirmities, both because we haue Bellarmines confession, That there are many things in the Decretall Epistles, which doe not make a matter to be De fide,

                     De vit. & hon. Cleri. Clericus.
                   For whereas the Councell is cited by him, Clerici nec Comam Nutriant nec barbam, by occasion whereof, many subsequent orders were brought in, for Shauing, and transgressors seuerely punish'd, it appeares that he left out in the end, the word Radant, which vtterly changed the precept into the contrary. These Canons therefore, of so sickely and weake a constitution, that any thing deiects them, cannot preuaile so much vpon our consciences, as to imprint and worke such a confidence in them, and irremoueablenesse from them, as to maintaine them with the same maner of testimonie, as we would doe the words of God himselfe.
               25 For, howsoeuer they depart from them, and seeme somewhat negligent of the Canons, when we make vse of them to our aduantage against them, yet they affright and enthrall the tender consciences of their owne Disciples, with nothing more, then the name of Canons, to which promiscuously they ascribe all reuerence and assent, without distinguishing to them, which are Gratians, and which are opinionate, and which Decretall, for all together are approoued and confirmed.

And after, the Iesuite, of whom I spoke before, had refreshed that Doctrine, That a Confession of a person absent, made by letters, was Sacramentall, and Clement the eight, was so vehement against it, that by a solemne decree he condemned it, for false, rash, and scandalous at least, and commaunded, that no man should speake of it but by way of condemning it, and excluded euen dumbe men from this benefi

And howsoeuer a superstition toward the Canons, may still be preserued in some of you, yet the generall state, that is, the same authority, by which those Canons were receaued before, which euer had anie strength here, hath disused them, & pronounced against so many of them, as can fall within this question, that is, Such as bee derogatorie to the Crowne. For, if these lawes bee not borne aliue, but haue their quickning by others acceptation, the same power that giues them life, may by desertion withdraw their strength, and leaue them inualid.
               33 And thus much seemed needfull to be said in the first part of this chapter, that you might see

how putrid and corrupt a thing it is, which is offered to you vnder the reuerend name of Canons; And that though this Cannon law be declined, and extenuated when we vrge it, yet euery Sentence thereof is equall'd to Diuine Scripture; and produced as a definition of the Church, when it may worke their ends vpon your consciences, which, for diuers reasons issuing out of their owne rules, should now be deliuered from that yoake.
               
                  THE SECOND PART.
                  FOr the second place in this Chapter, I reserued the consideration and suruay of those Canons which are Ordinarily vsurped for defence of this temporall Iurisdiction: In which my purpose is not, to amasse all those Canons which incline toward that point, of which condition those which exexempt the Clergy from secular Iurisdiction, and very many other, are, but onely such as belong more directly to this point, to which the Oath stretches, That is, whether the Pope may depose a Soueraine Prince, and so we shall discern whether your consciences may so safely relie vpon any resolution to be had out of the Canons, that you may incurre the dangers of the law, for refusall thereof.

                     nces elected;

but resign'd againe to Philip brother to the dead Emperour, in whom the greatest number consented. But some of the other Princes had called home out of England, Otho of the house of Saxony, and elected him. Here upon arose such a schisme, as rent that country into very many parts: And then Innocent the third, an actiue and busie Pope (for it was he which so much infested our King Iohn) sent his Legate into those parts, vpon pretence of composing those differences. And being in displeasure with the house of Sueuia for the Kingdome of Sicily, which was in their possession, but pretended to by the Church, his Legate disallowed the election of Philip, and confirmed Otho. But some of the Princes ill satisfied with the Legates proceeding herein, complained thereof to the Pope; in aunswere whereof the Pope writes to one of them, this Letter. In which, handling his Right of confirming the elected Emperor, though he speake diuers things derogatorie to the dignity of Princes, discoursiuely, and occasionally, yet is not this letter such a Decree, as being pronounced Cathedrally in a matter of faith, after due consultation, should binde posteritie, but onely a direction to that person, how he ought to behaue himselfe in that businesse.
                  4 The Letter may be thus abridged; VVe acknowledge the right of the Election to be in the Princes, especially because they haue it from the Apostolicke Sea,

which transferred the Empire vnto them: But, because we must consecrate the Person elected, we must also examine his fitnesse. Our Legate therefore did no Acte concerning the Election, but the person elected. Wee therefore repute OTHO Emperour; For, if the Electors would neuer agree, should the Apostolicke Sea alwayes be without a defender? We haue therfore thought it fit, to war
                           •
                        e the Princes, to adhere to him. For there are notorious impediments against the other: as publicke Excommunication, persecuting the Church, and manifest periurie. Therefore wee commaund you to depart from him, notwithstanding any Oath made to him, as Emperour.
                  
                  5 And is there any matter of Faith in this Decretall? Or any part thereof? Is it not all grounded vpon matter of fact, which is, the Translation o

                      but that he had full iurisdiction, in his owne Dominions before these Ceremonies, and now hee must stay for them.

For the Pope may well be presumed to be slacke in that office, because he pretends to be Emperour during the vacancie. But besides that an ouer earnest maintaining of this that the Emperour had no iurisdiction in Italy, before these Ceremonies, would diminish and mutilate the patrimonie of the Church, of which a great part was confe

                      the glosser vpon the Clementines, is liquid & round in this point, when he sayes, That these ceremonies, and the taking of an Oath, are nothing; and that now, Resipiscente mundo, the world being growne wiser, there must be no longer striuing for both swords.
                  
                  7 For those notorious impediments, which the Pope obiects in this letter, against Philip, if they were such as made him incapable of Election, then there was a Nullity in the choise, and the Pope did nothing but declare that; which may of
                        •
                     en

fall out in states, which elect their Princes, because there are many limitations, but in Successorie princes, it cannot hold: but if these were not such impediments, by the lawes which gouerned the Electors, they became not such, by this Declaration. For one of them, which is manifest periurie, the pope himselfe was some cause of his continuing therein. For the oath was made to his brother, in the behalfe of his young Nephew, who should haue beene Emperour. And now the Pope had not onely disabled him, but all the other Princes, from keeping that oath, by electing or confirming another Emperour.
                  8 But if all which the Pope sayes in that letter, shall not onely bee strong enough to binde the Election, but to binde the consciences of posterity, as matter of faith, his last reason against Philips election, must haue equall strength with the rest, which would bee of dangerous consequence; for it is, That if after his Father had beene Emperour, and his Brother, he also should succeede, the Empire would passe from Election to succession, and none should be assumed but of one house; Either then it is matter of faith, that three of one family may not succeed in an Electiue state, or, as this is, so all the rest are but arguments of inconueniencie & vnfitnes.
                  9 And this absoluing this Duke, to whom he writes, of his Oath, is but of an Oath made Ratione Regni, to him who neuer had the Kingdome:

and therefore that power of absoluing, cannot by this Decretall be extended to such Oathes, which are acknowledged to haue beene iust, when they were made, as being made to lawfull and indubitable Princes. And certainly (for though you dare not heare, yet wee dare speake trueth,) the whole purpose in that act, of the Pope, was corrupt, and farre from intention of making peace. Of whose profit by reason of that dissention one of your owne Abbats,

Reioyce for the iniquitie of the Sonnes of men; Iocundare de Adiutrice tua Discordia. Thou hast now that which thou didst alwaies thirst. Sing thy song, because thou hast ouercome the world, not by thy Religion, but the wickednesse of men, for men are not drawne to thee by their owne Deuotion, or by a pure Conscience, but by the doing of manifolde wickednesses, and by buying the Decision of their Suites and Causes.

                      and noted by Albericus (as I said) to be against Iustice, issued vpon this occasion. When Otho whom the former Pope had established against Philip, became vnthankfull to the Pope, hee also was excommunicate: and Frederick, the Sonne of the

first Frederick, to whom the Princes had sworne in his Cradle, was elected and crowned; with whom also, b
                        •

                     use hee would not goe into the holy land, and expose the Kingdome of Sicily to their Ambition, the Popes fell out, and excommunicated him thrice. And when a generall Councell was gathered by Innocent the fourth, for the reliefe of the holy land, the Pope himselfe proposed Articles against the Emperour. Whose Aduocate Thaddaeus promised all, which might conduce to peace and Reformation on his Maisters behalfe. This satisfied not the Pope, but he asked for Sureties: and when the Kings of England and France, were offered, the pope refused them, vpon pretence, that if the Emperor should remaine incorrigible, the Church should by this means raise more heauy enemies to it selfe. Then Thaddaeus proceeded to excuse his Maister, in all the particular obiections, and desired that hee m
                        •
                     ght be personally heard, but to that the pope replied, If he come I will depart, for I doe not yet finde my selfe fit and ready for martyrdome.
                     
                        Binius To. 3. par. 2. fo. 1482. Yet the English which were there, extorted a fortnights leasure for the Emperours comming: but he not daring or disdaining to come, the pope proceeded to this sentence of Depriuation; which, sayes the Relater the
                        •
                     eof, He thundred out terribly, not without the amazement and horrour of all the hearers and by-standers. And Thaddaeus protested vppon it, This

day is a day of wrath, and of calamity and miserie.
                  
                  11 So this Bull proceeded from a distempered Pope, and at a time when hee was not assisted with the Holy Ghost, for he was not in a readines to suffer Martyrdome for him. And where the Inscription saies, it was Presenti Concilio; the Margin notes, that it is not said approbante Concilio, though it assigne this for the reason, least the Pope should seeme to neede the Councell.
                  12 So that, though it reach full as farre as Pius the fift his Bull against our late Queene (for it depriues, it absolues Subiects, and it excommunicates all adherents) yet it hath nothing by which it should be called a Canon, or lawe to direct and gouerne posterity; for there might be as much infirmity in this act of Depriuing, as in the former of Excommunicating; yea it was subiect to much more errour then that acte of spirituall iurisdiction, which hath beene lesse questioned: yet in the preamble of this sentence, the pope saies of those former sentences, If the Church haue iniured him in any thing, she is ready to correct her selfe, to reuoke, and to make satisfaction. So that it may be, the pope erred in both these acts.
                  13 Nor doe those wordes which are in the Inscription, Ad perpetuam rei Memoriam, giue it the strength of a precedent, and obligatorie Canon, but rather declare out of what shoppe it came, since that is the ordinary stile of the Romane Court, and

not of the Canons of Councels. Nor can it euer be deduced by any consequence, out of this Sentence, That the Pope hath the same power ouer other Soueraigne Princes, as he exercised there against the Emperour; because hee proceeded against him (though vitiously and iniuriously, and tyrannically) by colour of a Superiority claimed by him, and then not denied by the Emperour, but testified by diuers Oathes of Fidelity to him, which cannot be extended against those princes, which admit no dependency vpon him, by any reason conteined in this Sentence.
                  14 By the third of these foure principall Rescripts, Clement the fift annuls a Iudgement made by the Emperour Henry the seuenth,
                        Clement. de Sentent. & re iudic. pastoralis. Anno 1306. against Robert king of Sicily, whom as a subiect of the Empire, the Emperour had declared a Rebell, and depriued him of his Kingdome and absolued his subiects of their obedience. And the reasons why the Pope interposes himselfe herein, are not grounded vpon his power, as he is Pope, or as he is spirituall Prince, but meerely as he is a temporall Prince. For first he saies, The King of Sicily held that Kingdome of the Church; and the Pope, who was thereby his ordinary iudge, ought to haue beene called to the iudgement; And that the Emperour could not take knowledge of faults committed at Rome, as those, with which that King was charged, were laid to be: Nor his Iurisdiction and power of citation extend into the territory of the

Church where that King was then residing: nor he bee bound vpon any Citation, to come to a place of so certaine danger.
                  
                  15 It is not therefore for this part of the Decretall, that either they alleadge it so frequently, or that Albericus laid that marke vpon it, that it betrayed the authority of the Emperours; for in this particular case, I should not bee difficult to confesse, some degrees of Iustice, in prouiding that the Sentence of the Empe

                  16 But the danger is in the last clause, which is, We out of the Superiority, which without doubt we haue ouer the Empire, and out of that power, by which we succeed therein, in a vacancy, and by that power which Christ gaue vs in Peter, declare that iudgement to bee voide, and reu

                  18 Hauing passed through these foure, wee will consider those Canons, which are in Gratian,
                     
to this purpose. The first whereof may iustly be the Donation of Constantine.

                  19 Towards the credit of this Donation, there lackes but thus much, to make it possible, That the Emperour had not power, to giue away ha

                     e, yet the Pope hath other iust titles to his estates, (though, by his leaue, he hath no such title,

as will authorize him to depose Princes, as Soueraigne Lord ouer all the Westerne Kings, as they pretend by this, if it were iustifiable) I will leaue it as they doe, as a thing too suspicious and doubtfull, to possesse any roome, but that which it doth in Gratian. Onely, this I will adde, that if the power of the Emperour were in the Pope, by vertue of this Donation, yet wee might safely take this Oath, because this Kingdome hath no dependance vpon the Empire.
                  20 The next that I finde alleadged, (to keepe this Order,
                        Dist. 9. Quae contrae.
                      as they lie in Gratian) is a sentence taken out of S. Augustine, by which you may see how infinite a power, they place in the Pope: His words are: If the King must bee obeyed, though hee commaund contra Societatem, yea, it is contra Societatem, if he be not obeyed, because there is a generall contract in humane Societies, that Kings must be obeyed; how much more must we obey God, the Gouernour of all Creatures?
                  
                  And do they which alleadge for the Popes Supremacy ouer Princes, intend the Pope to be Gouernour of all Creatures? Doth he gouerne Sea, and Elements? or doe they thinke that the will and commandements of God are deriued to vs onely by the way of the Pope? or why should not wee thanke them, for producing this Canon, since it is direct, and very strong for Kings, and for the Popes, it is but common with all other Magistrates,

                     21 In the tenth Distinction, one Pope by the testimony of two other popes, saies, That the Ecclesiastique Constitutions must be preferred before the Emperours lawes: And the cases mentioned there, are the constituting of a Met

                     apolitane, & the dissoluing of a Mariage, vpon entring into Religion; to which, I say, that these cases, by consent of the Emperours, were vnder their iurisdiction. And if you gather a generall rule by this, of the force of Canons aboue Ciuill lawes, you proceede indirectly accepting the same persons, for Parties, Iudges, and Witnesses: and besides it is not safe arguing from the Emperour to another absolute Prince, nor from the authority, which Canons haue in his Dominions, to what they should haue in all.
                  22 In the 21. Distinction, A Pope writing to a Bishoppe of Milan,

                     9. q. 7. Episcopo.
                     25 In the seuenth Question of the ninth Cause, from the Canon Episcopo, to the end of that Question, there are many sayings, which aduance the digni

Onely, in the Canon Fratres the king of Spaine seemes to be threatned, but it is with Excommunication onely. And all these Canons together, are deliuered by one Pope of another, In whome, sa
                        •
                     es the Glosse, It is a familiar kinde of proofe, for one one Pope to produce another for witnesse, as God did proue the sinnes of Sodome,

                  And as there is much iniustice in this manner of the Popes proceeding, so is there some tincture of blaspemy, in the maner of iustifying it, by this Comparison.
                  26 The Canon Alius, which droppes out of euery penne,15. q. 6. Alius.
                      which hath written of this Subiect, is the first wherein I marked any Pope to speake of Deposing; In this, Gelasius writes to Anastasius; a Pope to an Emperour, that Pope Zachary his

predecessor, had deposed the King of France, because he was vnfit for so great a power. But the Glosser doth the Pope good seruice, and keepes him within such a conuenient sense, as may make him say true; For, saies 
                        •
                     e, He deposed, that is, Hee gaue consent to them which did depose, which were the States of that Kingdome; which he saies, out of the Euidence of the history; for he is so farre f

                     raud and iniquity, then arrogance and tyrannie in the Pope. For, saies he, the vnfitnesse of the French King, was licentiousnesse, not infufficiency to gouerne, for then the Pope ought to haue giuen him an assistant.

                      age, to discharge their functions, the Pope assigns Coadiutores, and by this the Glosser might euict, that he hath the same Ordinary authority to dispose of Kingdomes, as of Bishoprickes. This Canon therefore doth onely vnfaithfully relate the act of another Pope, and not determine nor decree any thing, nor binde the conscience.
                  27 In the same Question, there is a Canon or two, in which our case is thus farre concern'd;15. q 6. Authoritat
                              •
                           m &c.
                      that they handle the Popes authority in Absoluing and Dispensing from Oathes: And the first is c
                        •
                     ted often and with great courage; because besides the word Ab omnibus Iuramentis, & cuiuscunquemodi obligationibus

absoluimus, there followes, parsue thē with the spirituall and materiall sword. But when we consider the case and the History, this power will not extend to our cause. For the Pope thereby doth giue liberty to some Bishops, to recouer by iust violence, such parts of the Church Patrimonie, as were taken away from them, and doth dispence with such oathes as they had beene forced to take, by those which iniuriously infested the Church. Yet I denie not but that the glosser vpon this Canon is liberall enough to the Pope, for he sayes, hee hath power to dispence against the law of Nature, & against the Apostle.
                  
                  
                     
                        Ibid.
                     28 After this, followes that solemne and famous Canon of Gregory the seuenth, Nos sanctorum. Of whom, since he had made a new rent in the body of the Church, (as Authors of his own Religion (if he had any) professe,) it is no maruaile that he patched it, with a new ragge in the body of the Canon law. Thus therefore he saies, Insisting vpon the statutes of our predecessors, by our Apostolique authority, wee absolue from their Oath of Alleageance, all which are bound to persons excommunicate; And we vtterly forbid them, to beare any Alleageance to such, till they come to satisfaction. But to whom shall these men be subiect in the meane time? To such a one as will be content to resigne, when so euer the other will aske forgiuenesse? Ambition is not an ague; it hath no fits, nor accesses,

                     guish it vpon a sodaine warning. And if the purpose of Popes in these deposings, were but to punish with temporarie punishment, why are the Kingdomes, which haue been transferred by that colou
                        •
                     , from Hereticall Princes, still with-held from their Catholique Heires?
                  29 But who these predecessors, of whom the Pope speaks in this letter, were, I could neuer find. And it appeares by this, that this was an Innouation, and that he vsed Excommunication to serue his own ends, because in another Canon he sayes,11. q. 3. Quoniam.
                      
                     That many perished by reason of Excommunications; and that therefore he being now ouercome with compassion, did temper that sentence for a time, and withdraw from that band, all such as communicated with the excommunicate person, except those by whose Counsaile, the fault was perpetrated, which induced the Excommunication. And this, sayes the glosse, he did,
                        Ver. Quoniam.
                      
                     because he saw them contemne excommunication, and neuer seek Absolution; for all those whom he exempts by this Canon, were exempt before his time by the law it selfe. So that where he sayes Temperamus,
                     
                        Ver. Temperamus.
                      it is but Temperatum esse ostendimus; and hee did but make them afraid, who were in no danger, and make them beholden to him, whom the law it selfe deliuered. And of this Canon in speciall words

But these (for in this Cause there are diuers Canons, for the obseruing of the Canons) are for the most part such imprecations, as I noted before, Gregory the first

Deleg. ca. 17. to interpose in all causes (which seemes to conduce to the Question in hand) they cite often this case falling out in England; which is, vpon seuerall occasions three or foure times intimated in the Decretals. It was thus: Alexander the third, writes to certaine Bishoppes in England, to iudge, as his Delegates, in a Matrimoniall cause. And because the person whose legitimation was thereby in question, was an 
                        •
                     eire, and the Mother dead, and the Pope thought it not fit, that after her death, her marriage should bee so narrowly looked into, since it was not in her life, therefore he appoints, That possession of the land should bee giuen first, and then the principall point of the marriage proceeded in. And by this they euict for him a title in temporall matters Accessorily, and Consequently. But if they consider the times, they may iustly suspect vniust proceeding; For it was when Alexander the third did so much infest our King Henry the second. And it seemes he did but trie by this, how much the King would endure at his hands; for when

he vnderstood that the king tooke it ill, then came another Letter, related also in the Canons, wherein hee confesseth, that that matter appertaines to the King, and not to the Church, And therefore commaundes them to proceede in the matter of the marriage, without dealing with the possession of the land.

                     33 Another Canon, not much vrged by the defenders of direct Authoritie, but by the other faction, is a Letter of Innocent the third. In which Letter, I beleeue the Pope meant to lay downe, purposely and determinately, how farre his power in Temporall matters extended. For it is not likely, that vpon a Petition of a priuate Gentleman, for Legitimation of his Children, who doubted not of his power to doe it, the Pope would descend to a long discourse and proofe out of both testaments, and reasons of conueniencie, that he might doe it, and then in the end, tell him, hee would not, except hee meant, that this Letter should remaine as euidence to posteritie, what the Popes power in Temporall causes was. Let vs see therefore what that is which he claimes.
                  34 A Subiect of the King of France, who had put away his Wife, desires the Pope to legitimate certaine Children which he had by a second wife. And, it seemes, he was encouraged thereunto, because the Pope had done that fauour to the King of France before: The Pope answers thus, By this,

it seemes, that I may graunt your request, because I may certainely Legitimate to all spirituall capacities, and therefore it is Verisimilius, & probabilius, that I may doe it in Temporall. And, sayes he, It seemes that this may be prooued by a similitude, because hee which is assumed to bee a Bishop, is exempted thereby from his fathers iurisdiction; and a slaue deliuered from bondage, by being made a Priest: And, hee addes, In the patrimonie I may freely doe it, where I am supreme Prince: But your case, is not the same as the Kings was, not o
                           •
                        
                        ly for spirituall considerations, which are, That he was lawfully seperated, and pretended neerenesse of blood, and was not forbid to marrie againe, and your proceeding hath beene without colour, and in contempt of the Church. But the King, who had no Superiour in Temporall matters, might without doing wrong to any other, submit himselfe to our iurisdiction; But you are knowen to be subiect to another. Thus farre hee proceeded, waueringly, and comparatiuely, and with conditions and limitations.
                  35 And least this should not stretch farre enough, he addes; Out of the Patrimonie in certaine causes, wee doe exercise Temporall iurisdiction casually,
                     
                        Ver. Certis.
                      which the Glosse interprets thus, That is when wee are requested
                     
                        •
                      And the Pope hath said before, That he which makes this request, must be one that hath no Superiour: And in this place he sayes, That this may not be done, to preiudice anothers right. But after this, vpon a false foundation, that is, an errour in their

Translation (where in Deuteronomie,

                     Excommunication; and therefore can imprint in you no reason to refuse this Oath. For out of this Canon, doth Victoria frame a strong argument, That this most learned Pope doeth openly confesse, by this Canon, that he hath no power ouer the King of France in Temporall matters.
                  
                  37 Another Canon of the same Pope is often cited,
                        De iudicijs nouit
                      by which, when the King of England complain'd, that the King of France had broken the Peace, which was confirm'd by Oath, the Pope writes to the Bishops of France, That though he intende not to iudge of that Title, in question, which appertaines not to him, yet the periurie belongs to his cognisance: and so, he may reprooue, and in cases of Contumacie, constraine, Per districtionem Ecclesiasticam, without exception of the persons of Kings: And therefore, sayes he, If the King refuse to performe the Articles, and to suffer my Delegates to heare the cause, I haue appointed my Legate, to proceede as I haue directed him. What his Instructions were, I know not by this; but beyond Excommunication, you see by the Text, he pretends not: Whatsoeuer they were, this is certaine, That the Princes of those times, to aduantage themselues against their enemies, with the Popes helpe, did often admit him, to doe some acts against other Princes, which after, when the Pope became their enemie, themselues felt with much bitternesse. But in this Canon, hee disclaimes any Iurisdiction to iudge of Titles; which

those Popes tooke to themselues, who Excommun

For so these Canons doe, when they Excommunicate, All of all Sexe,, of any Name, Fauourers, Receiuers, Defenders, Lawmakers, Writers, Gouernours, Consuls, Rulers, Councellours, Iudges, and Registers of any statutes, made in that place against Church liberties.

                     39 That the Canons haue power to abrogate Ciuill lawes of Princes, they vse to cite the Canon Quoniam omne, made by Innocent the third, who hath made more Canons then halfe of the Popes before him. And if this doe not batter downe, yet it vndermines all secular power. For they may easily pretend, that any Lawe, may in some case

                     occasion sinne. This Canon hath also more then Ordinary authority, because it is made in a generall Councell: thus it

                     escribes. But by this Canon, that particular Imperiall lawe is no more abrogated, then such other lawes as cannot be obserued without danger of sinne, which includes not onely some Ciuill Constitutions, but also some other Canons; For your Glosser saies,

                      He addes, That he doth not beleeue, that the Pope did purpose by this Canon, to preiudice the ciuill lawes, nor that the wordes are intended of ciuill and secular law, but that by those wordes, Tam ciuilis, quam Canonica, the Pope meanes, that a prescriber Malae fidei, is guilty in conscience, whether it be of a matter Secular or Ecclesiastique. For (saies bee) though some say, the Pope meant to correct the law herein, yet this correction is not obserued in Iudicio Seculari. And therefore (saies hee) I doe not beleeue, that the Pope himselfe is bound to iudge according to this Canon,

where he hath temporall iurisdiction, because hee hath that Iurisdiction from the Emperour: therefore the Imperiall law standes still, and is not abrogated by this Canon, though of a generall Councell.

                     40 This Pope also by a Canon in the title de Voto, hath gone the farthest of any, which haue fallen within my obseruation: for a King of Hungary, which had made a vowe to vndertake a warre for Hierusalem, preuented by death, imposed the execution thereof vpon his yonger sonne, who binding himselfe to performe it, with the armie which he leuied for that purpose, in pretence, troubled his brother in his Kingdome: To him therefore Innocentius writes, That except he doe forthwith performe the vow, he shall be excommunicate and depriued of all right to that Kingdome; and that the kingdome, if his elder brother die without issue, shall deuolue to his younger brother. But all these threatnings, except that one of Excommunication, were not thundered by the Pope, as though hee could inflict them, out of his authority, but he remembers this ill-aduised Prince, that except he performe the will of his father, he looses his inheritance by the law:

                     41 The Canon Solitae, though it be euery where alleadged, and therefore it importunes me to mention it, reaches not to our question, for it

is onely a Reprehension made by a Pope, to a Greeke Emperour, because hee did not affoord his Patriarch of Constantinople dignity enough in his place. And he tels him, that he mistakes S. Peters meaning, in his Epistle, where he teaches obedience to Emperours; For, saies he, he writ but to those which were vnder him, and not to al;1. Tet. 2.13. and he did prouoke them to a meritorious humility, not informe them of a necessary Duety; For, saies he, if that place shall be vnderstood of Priests, and literally, then Priests must bee subiect to Slaues, because it is Omni Creaturae, neyther (saies he) is it said, To the King, absolutely Precellenti, but tanquam precellenti, which was not added without cause. For (saies the Glosse) this word, Tanquam, is Similitudinarium,

Peter doth not call the king Superiour in truth, but as it were Superiour; as I noted the Cardinals to subscribe Letters to persons of lower ranke, Vester vti frater. And that which followes, of the punishment of euill doers, and praise of God, is not (saies he) that the King hath power of the sword ouer good and euill, but onely ouer them, which because they vse the sword, are vnder his iurisdiction. Then proceedes he to magnifie Priesthood, because Ieremie, to whom Commission was giuen ouer Nations, was descended of Priests: and because the Sunne which designes Priesthod, is so much bigger then the Moone: with so many more impertinencies, and barbarismes, and inconsequences, that I wonder why he, who summ'd it, should so

                  42 In the Canon Grauem, Honorius the third writes to certaine Prelates, whose Church had receiued much detriment by a Noble-man, That since he hath continued contemptuously vnder Excommunication two yeares, if vpon this last monition he refuse to conforme himselfe, they should discharge those Churches from their obedience to him, and denounce those which ought him alleageance, to be discharged therof, as long as be remained Excommunicate. But it appeares not here, whether hee were a Subiect of the Romane Church or no; And yet appeares plainely that he was no Soueraigne, and therefore no precedent in our case, in which there could not easily be restitution giuen to any, after another were in possession.

                  45 In the Common Extrauagants, that which they call vnam Sanctam, made by Boniface the eight, Anno 1302. hath the greatest force of all: both because it intends to proue and to Decree a certaine proposition, That it is of the necessitie of Saluation to be subiect to the Pope, and also because it determines it with Essentiall and formall words, belonging to a Decree, Declaramus, Definimus, Pronunciamus. And though in the body and passage of the Decree, there are sometimes arrogations of Secular Iurisdiction, by way of argument, and conueniencie, and Probable consequence; yet is there nothing drawne into the definition, and Decree, and thereby obligatorily cast vpon our Consciences, but onely this, That a Subiection to the Pope is, of the necessitie of Saluation.

                      For, sayes the glosse, it was the intention of the Pope in this Decretall, to bring reasons, examples, and authorities, to proue that Conclusion. So that, as if it pleased him to haue said so definitiuely,
                     
without arguing the case, the Decretall had beene as perfit and binding, as it is after all his reasons, and argumentation: so doe not his Reasons bind our reason, or our faith, being no part of the Definition, but leaue to vs our liberty, for all but the Definition it selfe.

                      made another Decree, That by this Definition or Declaration of Boniface, that Kingdome was not preiudiced, nor any more subiect to Rome, then it was before the making of that Decree. And though it was not Clements pleasure to deale cleerely, but to leaue the Canon of Boniface,
                     
as a stumbling blocke still to others, yet out of the whole History this will result, to vs, that if this temporall Iurisdiction, which some gather out of this Canon, were in the Pope, Iure Diuino, hee could not exempt the kingdome of Fraunce; and if it were not so, no Canons can create it But euen this exemption of Clement proues Bonifaces acte to be Introductory, and new, for what benefite hath any man by being exempted from a Declaratorie law, when for all that exemption,

                     50 And in the last Volume of the Canon law, lately set out in the Title, De Rescrip. & Mand. Apost. there is one Canon of Leo the tenth, and another of Clement the seuenth, which annull all Statutes and ciuill constitutions, which stoppe Appeales to Rome, or hinder the execution of the Popes bulles; and inflicts Excommunication, and Interdicts the Dominions of any, which shall make or fauor such Statutes. But because these Canons doe not define this
                        •
                     , as matter of faith, I doubt not but the Catholiques of England would bee loath to aduenture the daungers

which our Lawes inflict, vpon such as seeke Iustice at Rome, which may be had here: And they doe, though contrarie to these Canons, in continuall practise, bring all their causes into the Courtes of Iustice here, which, if the Canons might preuaile, belong'd to Rome.
                  51 And these be all the Canons, which I haue mark'd either in mine owne reading of them, or from other Authors which write of these questions; to bee cited to this purpose. Those which concerne Ecclesiasticke immunitie, or the Popes spirituall power I omitted purposely

                  52 Heere therefore I will conclude, that though to the whole body of the Canon Law, there belong'd as much faith and reuerence, as to the Canons of the old Councels, yet out of them, you can finde nothing to assure your consciences, that you may incurre these dangers for refusall of the Oath. Nor may the Pope bee presum'd to imag

                  THough that which hath beene said in the former Chapter of the Decretall Letters of Popes, extend also to these Breues, since they are all of the same elements and complexion, and subiect to the same diseases and infirmities: Yet because these two Breues, may bee said to haue beene addressed directly and purposely to giue satisfaction in this particular businesse, they may challendge more obedience, and lay a more Obligation then those other Decretals, which issuing vpon other occasions, doe not otherwise concerne the question in hand, then by a certaine relation, and consequence, and comparison of the circumstances which produced them, with the circumstances which begot these Breues.
               2 It seemes that the Pope when hee would restraine the subiects of Princes, and keepe them short, when he would cut off there naturall and profitable libertie of obeying Ciuill Lawes, when he would fetter and manacle them in perplexities, and make them doe lesse then they should, to the

losse of life, and liberties, he is content to send his Breues; But when he will swell and blow vp Subiects with Rebellion, when he will fill them with opinions, that they may resist the entrances, or interrupt the possessions of Princes, when hee will haue them doe mo

               3 And as the Popes haue euer beene abstinent in declaring and expressing in certaine and euident tearmes, how they haue this temporall Iurisdiction, least hauing once ioynde issue vpon some one way, all men should bende their proofes against that, and being once defea

danger of Mortall sinne, whatsoeuer can warrant any man to transgresse this law, must haue both Authority, and Euidence enough, to assure the Conscience, which till then is bound thereby, that either for some Substantiall, or for some formall Defect, this was neuer any law, or that it is Abrogated, or that the persons of Catholiques are exempted from it.

emprest when hee leuies an Armie, or any such act due by conscience to his lawes, should this worke so vpon you, as to make you incurre the penalties of lawes, or suspicion of ill affected subiects?

                  h annull it, So would it make any considerate conscience to doubt, whether such a Breue can warrant the expence of blood, or incurring other Capitall dangers, that obserues, how often the Breues which haue issued vpon best consideration and assistance of Counsell, haue beene reuoked; not vpon new emergent matter, but vpon better knowledge of the former. Of which

it seemes to me to be of good vse, to present one illustrous and remarqueable example.
               12 Eugenius the fourth, hauing first by one Bull dissolued the Councell held at Basil, and transfered it to another place, the Councell for all that proceeding, the Pope by a second Bull, annuls all which that Councell had yet, or should after Decree; and this, by the Councell, and Assent of the Cardinals. After this the Councell cytes him, and all his Cardinals, vpon whom it inflicts confiscation, and other penalties, if they forbeare to come. And then the Pope by a third Bull annuls that decree of Citation, and excommunicates al persons, euen Kings and the Emperour, if they execute vpon any, that Decree of the Councell. And then he publishes a fourth Bull, by which he answeres all obiections made against him by the Councel, and hauing so established his owne innocence, he annuls all acts made in preiudice thereof, and this also with assent and subscription of the Cardinals. And at last he sends out a fift Bull, in which hee takes knowledge, that his first Bull of dissoluing the Councell, had occasioned many grieuos dissentions, and was like to occasion more, and therefore now, he Decrees and Declares (by the Councell and Assent of his Cardinals still) not only that the Councell of Basil should from thenceforth be good and lawfull, but that it was so, when that Bull came, and that it had beene so from the time of the beginning thereof.
                  
And so in expresse wordes, hee annuls his annulling of it: and he reuokes two former Buls, and pronounces them Irritas, Annullatas, Cassatas; by the first whereof he had disabled the Councell, and by the second had excommunicated Princes, which should execute that, which he pronounces now to be iust: and of the other Bull he saies, It proceeded not from him, nor by his knowledge, though it were testified by the Cardinals, and endorsed formally by his Secretary. And euen this last Bull of so many Reuocations, Annihilations, and Tergiuersations was not thought strong, nor out of the danger of being reuoked againe, till the Councell accepted it, and ratified it by applying the BVLL and Seale of the Councell to it.
               13 So is it familiar in the Popes, not for the variety of iust occasion, but for pe

                     Id. fo. 415. and beheaded his body; which I wonder how he found, since Pope Stephen had so long before cast it into Tyber.

faith, as amongst them, an Autentique translation of the Bible, is, betweene the Edition of Sixtus the fift, and the Edition of Clement the eight, there is so much difference, euen in absolute and direct Contradictions, as he which reades the seuerall Breues, by which those two Editions are authorised; both hauing equall iustifications of the present Editions, equal absolutions from oathes for admitting any other, equall imprecations and curses, for omitting these, may well thinke that that is a weake and litigious title to Ma

               15 For, as they haue forbidden many lawfull things, and offered to destroy the lawes themselues, so haue they allowed and authorized manie things, which our owne Reason, and discourse, and Experience, can conuince of falshood.

hee which doth beleeue such a confirmation, is bound thereby to beleeue as many errours, as are in Gratian. For, it seemes we haue no longer liberty to doubt, after such a confirmation: as it will follow euidently out of Bellarmines fashion of arguing,

So that if either Eugenius confirmed it before, or Gregory the thirteenth since, our liberty is precluded, and we must credulously, and faithfully swallow, not onely all the vnwholsome, and insipid negligences, ignorances, and barbarismes of Gratian, but all the bitter and venomous mixtures to Christs merit, and all the blasphemies and diminutions of his Maiest

                     De libert. Eccles. l. 2. c. 9. as the opinion onely, Quorundam ex Antiquioribus Scholasticis, yet afterwards hee affoords an interpretation to it; but such a one, as I think any Catholique would be loth to venter his Martyrdome thereupon, if he were to die for obedience to a Breue. For thus he saies, In euery matter, when a Hypotheticall proposition is made, of the condition whereof we are certaine, then the whole proposition must not be said to be Hypothetically and Conditionally true, but absolutely. And this he exemplifies by this Proposition: If Christ doe come to iudgement, there shall be a resurrection, which proposition is absolutely and not conditionally true, because we are certaine that Christ will come to Iudgement: And so he saies, That it is the meaning of all them who affirme that the Pope may er

                  27 So that when Bellarmine vndertooke to aunswere all, which had beene obiected out

of Dante, and Bocace, and Petrarche, against Rome, it was but a lasie escape, and around and Summarie dispatch vpon wearinesse, to say, that all that was meant of the Court of Rome, not of the Church; and therefore it was a wise abstinence in him, not to repeate Petrarchs words, but to recompense them by citing other places of Petrarch in fauour of the Romane Church. For though Petrarch might meane the Court, by the name of Babilon, and by imputing to it Couetousnesse and Licentiousnesse, yet when he charges Rome with Idolatrie, and cals it the Temple of Heresie, can this be intended of the Court of Rome?
               28 The disobedience to Popes (in whome no moderate men euer denied some degrees of the leauen and corruption, of such passions and respects as vitiate all mens actions) was not alwayes esteem'd thus hainous, though in matters neerer to the foundations of Faith, then these which are now in question. The famous dissention betweene Pope Stephen and Cyprian, is good euidence thereof. For though now they say,

                  because hee

thought that the Pope was in a pernitious errour. And though Cyprian is neuer found to haue retracted either his Doctrine of rebaptization, or his behauiour to the Pope, yet the seuerest Idolaters of that Sea, haue neuer denied him a roome amongst the blessed Saints of the purest times.

But this (saies Baronius) he did not out of any displeasure to the Pope, but to defend the iurisdiction of his Church, as he was bound by oath, vnder the da

lawfull to him, may not be so to you? when as to you the Breues haue onely brought a naked and bare commandement, without taking knowledg of your allegations: but the Pope gaue Ignatius three seuerall warnings; and disputed the case with him: and tolde him that by the records at Rome, it was euident, and that no man was ignorant, that that region belong'd to the Romane Church, and that Ignatius his pretences to it, because the enemy had interrupted the Romane possession were of no force; which he proues by a Decree of Pope Leo, and diuers other waies: Yet for all this, Ignatius held out, endured the excommunication, and died vnder that burden, and yet God hath testified by many miracles, the holinesse and sanctitie of this reuerent man.

And therefore we must dispaire if it be left, Arbitrio humano: For (saies he) the Pope must trust others, and they may deceiue him, if hee were Saint Gregory himselfe. And he addes further,

                  We talke as though wee needed great Engines to extort a Dispensation, as though there were not me expecting at Rome, when any man wil come and ask a dispensation of all those things, which are prouided against by the lawes: and though hee confesse, that former Popes were not so limited, as he desiers

the Popes in these times, might be, it was, saies hee, because they did not presume, so easily to dispence against Councels. Da mihi Clementes, prouide me, sayes he, such Popes as Clement, Linus and Syluester were,

               6 When Paulus 4. had a purpose to take in, and binde more sorts of men, by that oath which was framed according to the Trent Councell, for them onely who were admitted to spirituall dignities, and some few others, and so to swear all those men fast to the Doctrine of that Councel, and to the obedience of the Church of Rome, it is expressed in so exquisite and so safe wordes, as can admit no escape. For, how ignorant soeuer he be in controuerted Diuinity, euery one which takes that oath, must sweare, That there are seuen Sacraments instituted by Christ; which any of their Doctors might haue doubted and impugn'd an houre before; as it appeares by Azorius,

                   when they come to be Crowned by the Pope. For before he enters the land of the Church, he takes one oath, Domino Papae iuro, that I will exalt him with all my power. And before he enters Rome, he sweares, that he will alter nothing in that Gouernement, And before he receiues the Crowne, he sweares, that he will protect the Popes person and the Church. And in the creation of a Duke,

                   because hee might haue some dependance vpon another Prince, the Pope exhibites to him this oath; I vow my reuerence and obedience to you, though I be bound to any other.
               
               8 So did Gregory the seuenth exact a curious oath of the Prince of Capua,

And so when the Emperour Henrie the seuenth, though he confessed that he had swo

Popes haue tooken order, not onely to insert the oath into the body of the Canon Lawe,

               9 With how much curiositie and vnescapablenesse their formes of Abiuration vnder oath are exhibited? They thought they had not giuen words enow to Berengarius,

               10 But yet this seem'd not enough;

And accordingly the Inquisition giue an oath, in which, sayes hee, Nulla manet rimula elabendi; For he must sweare, That he abiures all Heresies, and will alwayes keepe the faith of Rome; And that

he hath told all, of others, and of himselfe, and euer will doe so; And that if he doe not, he renounces the benefit of this Absolution, and will trouble the Court with no more dayes of hearing; but sayes he, Ego me iudico.
               
               11 And if wee doe but consider the exacte formes, and the aduantagious words and clauses, which are in their Exorcismes, to cast out, and to keepe out Diuels, they may be good inducements, and precedents to vs, how diligent we should be, in the phrase of our Lawe
                     •
                  , to expell and keepe out Iesuites, and their Legion, which are as craftie, and as dangerous.
               12 When therefore it was obserued, that not onely most of the Iesuites Bookes which tooke occasion to speake either of matter of State, or Morall Diuinitie, abounded with trayterous and seditious Aphorismes, and derogatorie from the dignitie of Princes in generall; but that their Rules were also exemplified, and their speculations drawne into practise in this Kingdome, by more then one Treason; and by one, which included and exceeded all degrees of irreligion and inhumanity, then was it thought fit to conceiue an oath, whose end, and purpose, and scope was, to try & finde out, who maintained the integrity of their naturall and ciuill obedience so perfectly, as to sweare, that nothing should alter it, but that he would euer do his best endeuour to the preseruation of the Prince, what enemie so euer should rise against him.
               
                  13 And if any of the materiall words, or any clause of the Oath, had beene pretermitted, then had not the purpose and intent of the Oath beene fulfilled; That is, no man had auerr'd by that oath, that he thought himselfe bound to preserue the King against All enemies, which to doe, is meere Ciuill obedience. For though the generall word of Enemie, or Vsurper, would haue encluded and enwrapped as wel the Pope, as the Turke, when either of them should attempt any thing vpon this Kingdome
                     •
                   yet, as it hath euer beene the wisdome of all States, in all Associations and leagues, to ordaine Oathes proper to the busines then in hand, and to the imminent dangers: So now it was most necess
                     •
                  rie to doe so, because the malignitie of men of that perswasion in Religion, had so violently broke foorth, and declar'd it-selfe; Which happie diligence, the effect praises and iustifies enough, since it appeares, that if these particular clauses had not beene inserted, they would haue swallowed any Oath, which had beene presented in generall termes and haue kept their Consciences at large to haue done any thing, which this Oath purpos'd to preuent.
               14 He therefore that should desire to bee admitted to Sweare, that hee would preserue the King against all his enemies, Except the Pope, or those whom he should encourage or imploy; Or that he would euer beare true Allegeance, Vntill
                  
the Pope had discharged him, or that he
                     •
                   would discouer any conspiracie which did happen before the Pope did authorize it; Or that he would keepe this Oath, Vntill the Pope gaue him leaue to breake it: this man should be farre from performing the intent and scope of an Oath, which should be made for a new attestation, that hee would according to his naturall duetie, and inborne obedience, absolutely desend the King from All his enemies.
               15 I make no doubt but the Iesuites would haue giuen way to the Oath, if it had beene conceiu'd in generall words, of All obedience, against all Persons; for it were stupiditie to denie that

               16 All which they quarrell at in the oath, is, that any thing should be pronounced, or any limits set, to which the Popes power might not extend: but they might as well say that his spirituall power were limited or shortned, and so the Catholique faith impugned, if one should denie him to haue power ouer the winde and sea; since to tame and commaund these, in ordine ad spiritualia, would aduance the conuersion of the Indies, and impaire the Turks greatnesse, and haue furthered his fatherly & spirituall care of this Kingdome in 88.
               17 All the substance of the oath is virtually comprehended in the first proposition, That king Iames is lawfull King of all these Dominions; The rest are but declarations, and branches naturally and necessarily proceeding from that roo

               21 As therefore Saint Paul suffered Circumcision as long as toleration thereof, aduanced the propagation

and growth of the Church, when a seuere and rigid inhibition thereof would haue auerted many tender and scrupulous consciences, which could not so instantly passe from a commandement of a necessity in taking Circumcision, to a necessity in leauing it; But when as certaine men came downe and taught,

                   any: and kings can haue no assurance of being so, if they admit professors of that Religion, which teache, that the Pope may at any time Depose them.
               22 We doe not therefore by this oath exempt the King from any spirituall Iurisdiction; Neither from o

Nor from discreet reprehension if hee should transgresse. We doe neither, by this oath, priuiledge him from the Censures of the Church, nor denie, by this oath, that the Pope hath iustly ingrossed and reserued to himselfe the power to inflict those censures vpon Princes. We pronounce therein against no power which pretendes to make Kings better Kings, but onely against that, which threatens to make them no kings.
               23 For if such a power as this, of deposing and annihilating Kings, bee necessarie, and certaine in the Church, and the Hierarchie thereof be not well established, nor our saluation well prouided for, without this power, as they teach, why was the Primitiue Church destitute thereof? For if you allow the answere of Bellarmine, That the Church did not depose Kings then because it lacked strength,

                   you returne to the beginning againe, and goe round in a circle. For the wisedome of our Sauiour is as much impeached, and the frame of the Church is as lame, and impotent, and our saluation as ill prouided for, if Christ doe not alwayes giue strength and abilitie to extirpate wicked kings, if that be necessarie to saluation, as he were if he did not giue them Title and Authoritie to doe it. Yea, all tese defect; would still remaine in the Church, though Christ had giuen Authoritie enough, and Strength enough, if he did not alwayes infuse in the Pope, a Will to doe it.
               
                  24 And where this power of deposing Princes may be lawfully exercised, as in States where Princes are Conditionall, and not absolute and Soueraigne, as if at Venice the State should depose the Duke, for attempting to alter that Religion, and induce Greeke errours, or Turcisme, or if other States, which might lawfully doe so, should depart from the obedience, and resist the force of their Princes, which should offer to bring into that State, the Inquisition, or any other violence to their Conscience, if the people in these States should depose the Prince, did they doe this by any Spirituall Authoritie, or Iurisdiction? Or were this done by such a Temporall Authoritie, as were indirect, or casuall, or incident, or springing out of the spirituall authoritie, as the Popes ridler makes his authoritie to bee? Or must they stay, to aske and obtaine leaue of their Clergie, to depose such a transgressor? If therefore such a particular state, in whom the Soueraignty resides, haue a direct temporall power, which enables it sufficiently to maintaine, and conserue it selfe, such a supreme spirituall power, as they talk of in the Pope, is not necessarie for our saluation, nor for the perfection of the Church gouernment.
               25 Nor is there any thing more monstrous, and vnnaturall and disproportioned, that that spirituall power should conceiue or beget temporall: or to rise downwards, as the more degrees of

They may be better trusted with the spirituall Iustice of the Church, and make the censures thereof profitable to the delinquent, and others by his example. They may be better trusted with the spirituall treasure of the Church, and apply and dispence the graces, of which they haue the stewardship, at their discretion. They may be better credited with canonizing of Saints, and such acts of spirituall power, then others: and these are many, and great offices, to be put into one bodies hands. But tha

                   out of this power, and then onely when this power is at her fulnesse and perfection in the Pope, there should arise and growe a temporall power, which in their estimation, is so poore and wretched a thing, that a boy which doth but shaue his head, and light a candle in the Church, is aboue it, (for so they say, euen of the lesser Orders) is either

impossible, or to prodigious, as if (to insist vpon their owne comparisons of spirituall and temporall power) the Sunne at his highest glory, should be said to produce a Moone-light, or golde, after all trials and purifyings, should bring

               26 Nor doe they for this Timpany, or false conception, by which spirituall power is blowne vp, and swelled with temporall, pretend any place of Scripture, or make it so much as the putatiue father thereof. For they doe not say, that any place of Scripture doth by the literall sense thereof, immediatly beget in vs, this knowledge, That the Pope may depose a Prince; but all their arguments are drawne, from naturall reason, and discourse, and conuenience. So that, if either the springe which moues the first wheele, or any wheele by the way be disordered, the whole Engine is defeated, and made of no vse.
               27 And in this wee will ioyne and concurre with Azorius the Iesuite,
                  
                     To. 2. l. 4. C. 5. §. Tertio.

                     things which neither the Scriptures doe in expresse words forbid the Pope to doe, nor the Canons can disable him
                        •
                      because hee is aboue them, yet the very law of Nature inhibites them, and prouides that by no meanes they may be done; and that if the Pope should doe such a thing, there were a Nullity in the action, and the Church would neuer permit it, but doe some act in opposition against it, And all this out of this respect, That

naturall Reason would teach them, that the generall peace and tranquility of the Christian Common-wealth would be disturbed thereby.
               
               28 If therefore in the point in question, wee must be directed by naturall reason, and dispute which is most profitable and conuenient for the peace of Christian states, though it may bee long vncertaine on both sides, where the victorie will fall, yet, during the suite, Melior est conditio possidentis. And since it is confessed, that Princes before they accepted Christianitie, had no Superiour, and nothing appeares why Princes should not be as well able to gouerne Subiects in Christian Religion, as in Morall vertue, or wherein they neede an equall Assistant, or Superiour, now, more then before, or by what au

               29 And, I thinke, I may safely auerre, that it

will not constitute a Martyrdome, to seale with your bloud any such point heere, as the affirming of the contrary, would not draw you into the fire at Rome. Except you should be burned for an Opinion there, you cannot be reputed Martyrs, for holding the contrarie here. As therefore it were no Heresie at Rome, to denie the Popes direct power, nor his indirect, (for if it were, Bellarmine and Baronius had made vp an Heresie betweene them, as Sergius and Mahomet did) so is the affirmation thereof no article of faith in England.
               
               30 This then being so farre from being an Article of faith, by what power the Pope may depose a Prince, as that it is euen amongst them which affect an Ignorance, but Dubium speculatiuū, a man may safely, and ought to take the Oath: For so a man of much authority amongst themselues doth say,

And he ads this in confirmation; That where one part is certaine, and the other doubtful, we may not leaue the sure side, and adhere to the other. In his example that which hee presumes for certaine, is this, That euery man ought to defend his Prince, and the speculatiue doubt is, Whether the

warre be iust or no. If this be applied 
                     •

                   further then our case, in any probability, is like to extend to) the Prince is not bound to giue an account to the subiect of the iustice of the cause: And therefore (saies hee) in doubtfull cases, the safer part is to be followed: And if he should not fight for his Prince, he should expose the State to the enemy, which is a much more grieuous offence, then to fight against the enemy, though he doubt of the cause.

                   And though the Pope annulled this sentence, it was not because the Emperour might not doe this, but because the king of Sicily held also of

the Church, and this absoluing of Subiects made by the Emperour, extended to the Subiects of the Church.
               34 So also the Emperours Antoninus and Verus, when one had made an oath,
                     Dig. li. 50. Tit. 1. Ad munic. le. fin.
                   that he would neuer come into the Senate, creating him such an Officer, as his personall attendance was necessary in the Senate house, by an expresse Rescript, absolued him of his oath. Of which kinde there are diuers other examples.
               35 And your Canons doe not require this spirituall Iurisdiction, alwaies in this Act of absoluing an oath.15. q. 6. Authoritatem. gloss.
                   For if I haue bound my selfe to another by an vniust oath, in many cases I may pronounce my selfe absolued; and in others I may complaine to the Iudge, that hee may force him, to whom I swore, to absolue me of this oath. And in such cases as we are directed to goe to the Church, and the gouernour thereof, it is not for absolution of the oath, but it is for iudgement, whether there were any sinne in making that oath, or no. For when that appeares, out of the Nature of the matter, arises and results a Declaration sufficient, whether wee are bound or absolued. If therefore the matter of this oath be so euident, as being Morall, & therefore constant and euer the same, that it can neuer neede his iudgement, because it can in no case be sinne, the scruple which some haue had, that by denying this power of absoluing, his spirituall

power is endamaged, is vaine and friuolous.
               
                  THE SECOND PART.
                  FRom this imputation, of impairing his spirituall
                      power, euery limme and part of the oath, hath beene fully acquited, by great, and reuerend persons, so, as it were boldnesse in me, to add to that which they haue perfited; since additions doe as much deforme, as defects. Onely, because perchance they did not suspect, that any would stumble at that clause, which in the oath hath these words, I abiure as impious, and Hereticall, that position, &c. I haue not obserued that any of them, haue thought it worthy of their defence; But because I haue found in some Catholiqus, when I haue importuned them to instance, in what part of the oath sp

                        rituall Iurisdiction was oppugned, or what deterr'd them from taking the same, that they insisted vpon this, That it belonged onely to the Pope to pronounce a Doctrine to be Hereticall, and that, since there was a Canon of a generall Councell pretended for the con

                  37 It is no strange nor insolent thing with their Authors, to lay the Note of Heresie vpon Articles, which can neither be condemned out of the word of God, nor are repugnant to any Article of faith; for Castrensis, that he might thereby make roome for traditions,

So that with you, a man may be subiect to the penalties, & so to the infamie, & so to the damnation belonging to an Heretique, though hee hold nothing against the Christian faith.

So therefore a certaine and naturall euidence of a morall truth, such as arises to euery man, That to a

King is due perpetuall obedience, is better authority to induce an assurance, and to produce an oath, that the contrary is Hereticall, then an implicite credite rashly giuen to a litigious Councell, not beleeued by all Catholiques, and not vnderstood by al that sweare to beleeue it.

not within a yeere, let it be signified to the Pope, that he may denounce his subiects to be absolued from their Alleageance, and expose his Land to Catholickes, which may without contradiction possesse it, the right of the principall Lord (which we call Lord Paramount) being reserued, if hee giue no furtherance thereunto. And thus farre without doubt the Canon did not include Principall and Soueraigne Lords, because it speakes of such, as had Lords aboue them.

                  51 And this doctrine and position, which this Oath condemnes, will lacke nothing of formall

                  53 But leauing this exact and subtill appellation of Heresie, let him whom that scruple deterrs from the oath, That hee must sweare the doctrine to be Hereticall, consider in what sense our law vnderstands the word in that place.

And no man can doubt, but that the law-maker in this law, hath forbidden Defection from the Prince; and the purpose of the law, was to prouide onely against that. Out of which purpose no man can iustly collect, that the Deponent should pronounce the contrarie Doctrine, so Hereticall, as that he which held it, or relapsed into it, might be burnt; but that it was apparantly erroneus, and impious, and fit to bee abiured; And how little erroneous lackes of Hereticall,

                  55 Nor is there required in this Deponent, such an assurance in Faith, as belongs to the making of an Article, Formall Heresie, but such an assurance in Morall reason, and Humane discourse, as Bartholus requires in him which takes and Oath,

                  56 And the word Hereticall in this Oath, hath

so much force, as the word to Anathematize, hath in many Councels. As, for example, in that place of the Councell of Constantinople,
                     
                        Ca. 11. where it is said, Let him be Anathematiz'd, which doeth not Anathematize Origen. Which is meant of a detestation and abhorring som of his opinions, not of pronouncing him, a formall and consummate Hereticke. For you may well allow a Ciuill and conuenient sense to this word, in this Oath, that it meanes onely Impious,

                     Though a law should prouide expresly, that the words of the law should bee vnderstood as they lie, yet they must receiue their interpretation from the common vse of speach; which is, that which the most part in that Country doe vse. And if both significations may be found in common vse, that must be followed, which out of likelihood and reason, seemes to haue beene the meaning of the lawmaker, though it be improper
                           •
                         And his meaning appeares, when the word taken in the other sense, would create some absurd, or vniust matter. And as amongst vs, those with whom this word

                     Hereticall is in most vse, which are Diuines, vse the word promiscuously, and indifferently, against all impious opinions: so especially did the Lawmaker at this time vse it, because otherwise, it had beene both absurd, to decree a point to be properly hereticall, which was not brought into debatement, as matter of faith, and it had beene vniust, vnder colour of requiring ciuill obedience, to haue drawn the deponent, to such a confession, as if he had relapsed and fallen from it after, hee might haue beene burned.
                  58 And the words of the oath agree precisely to Sayrs rule; for the deponent must sweare, according to the exp
                           •
                        esse wordes, and the plaine and common sense, and vnderstanding of the same. And Sayr saies, That if we must sweare to a Law, according to the proper signification of the words, then there is no place for such discretion, and for admitting a diuers sense: but the wordes of our Oath, which are, According to the plaine, and common sense, fall directly within his first Rule.
                  59 And the law hath good warrant and precedent to assume the word, hereticall, in such a moderate signification; for so the Scriptures vse the word,1. Cor. 11.19. when S. Paul saies, oportet hereses esse, which Gretzer confesses, when to excuse the vulgate Edition, which hath in that place,

                      an authour, of your owne Religion, pronounces thus of those fifteene Bishops, which adhered to Gregory the seuenths party, against the Emperor, It is great heresie to resist the Ordinance of God, who onely hath power to giue Empire, which heresie it appears that those fifteene false Bishops haue committed.
                  
                  65 As therefore all sorts of men, into whose mouthes vpon any occasion this word was like to come haue vsed the word for Erroneous: and Impious, and Corrupting good manners, and disposing & preparing absolute and proper Heresie, so doth the law accept it in this oath, where it makes it equiualent, and Synonimous, to the wordes which are ioyned with it, which are Impious and Damnable: and therefore it is but a Calumny cast vpon the law, and a tergiuersation picked out for their escape, if any pretend for that word, to decline the Oath.
                  66 But if this word in this place, were to be

vnderstood in the strictest and seuerest sense, that a Iesuite could vse it against vs, yet hee that shall take the Oath, doth not thereby pronounce, that any Position, which attributes any power to the Pope, is hereticall. Not, that hee may excommunicate a King; no, nor that he may depriue him: but it is thus conceiued, That this position is hereticall, That Princes which be excommunicate, or depriued by the Pope, may be deposed or murdred by their subiects or any other. So that it casts no Manicles vpon the Popes hands; if he will excommunicate, let him; if he will depriue, let him. Onely them, who by his act, (of the goodnes or badnes whereof this Proposition pronounces nothing) may be mis-led to an vnchristian & vndutifull desperatenes, it forewarnes, and aduises, to a due and iust consideration of such proceedings. For, as when men were content to heare heresies,

                     Leo said wisely, in reprehension of that easinesse, They which can hearken to such things, can beleeue them, So since it is too late to forbid hearing of this heresie, of deposing Princes, since out of Iesuites bookes, which speak of state-learning, scarce any thing is to be sucked, but it, or such preparatiues, as worke and conduce to it, it was necessary to begin a step higher then Leo did, and pronounce it hereticall, that so none might beleeue it, since hee that can beleeue it, can be content to affoord his helpe to the doing thereof.
                  
                     67 And hauing thus gone as far as I purposed in both parts of this Chapter, in the first whereof I shewed, that in speciall cases new oathes were necessary, and that the forme of them ought to bee such, as might reach home to the intent thereof, and not be eluded, which had beene, if any part of this oath had been omitted, and that their writers, which neuer teach, that vpon a Bishops excommunication a Prince may be deposed, denie implicitely this power in the Pope, because onely that power which was in the Bishops, in this matter, is transferd by Reseruation into the Pope, and that where such Depositions are needefull, the state is prouided naturally with a temporall power to effect it, and therefore it is not necessarie to place it in the spirituall, which were monstrous and vnperfect, if it should produce, as the most excelent issue therof, a power so base in their estimation, And that this possibility of being Deposed, is as contrary to Souerainety, as a certaine limitation, when he shall be remoued, And that those writers, which limit the Popes power by Naturall Reason, and which teach, that in doubts of speculation, we may for all that proceede to practise, as farre, as wee doe in this Oath, And hauing in the second part declared, That though the Papists make proper, and absolute Heresie, to be without matter of faith, yet we doe not so, and yet in points necessarily and immediately

issuing out of these principles, a generall Councell needs not be attended to informe a mans vnderstanding what is Hereticall, because the Emperors and other Princes, and diuers Authors, and registers of heresies, haue pronounced therin before any Decision of Councells, and that the Canon which is obtruded, in the name of the Laterane Councell, for diuers reasons, cannot impeach this proposition, That this Doctrine is hereticall, which proposition, though if it were tryed by Bellarmine, and by Saint Augustines description of heresie, it would appeare absolutely hereticall, yet this law giues it that name in a vulgar and common sense, as Scriptures, Councels, Buls of Popes, Fathers, Schoolemen, Historians, Iesuits, and the Common sort hath vsed and accepted it, and that if it be taken in the sharpest sense, the Oath may neuerthelesse be taken without preiudice, or limitation of any power which the Pope himselfe claimes, I make account that I haue discharged my promise and vndertaking in this Chapter, and deliuered as much, as without inculcating that which hath beene formerly said by others, (which I purposely auoided) in this point of the oath neede to be said to any, of indifferency or equall inclination.
