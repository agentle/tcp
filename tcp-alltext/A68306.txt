For to mans reaſon nothing appeareth more abſurde, foliſhe nor vnreaſonable, then yt God (whoſe powre no creature is able to reſiſt) ſhal ſend fourth his meſſingers to performe his worke and wil,The preaching of the worde ſemeth foliſhnes to the worlde. and that the ſame ſhalbe ſo impugned, that their building in their owne eyes ſhalbe ouerthrowne, and deſtroyed, and that the natural man can not ſe how the promeſſes of Chriſt Ieſus, made to his Apoſtles, and vnder their names to all true preachers of his holy Goſpel, in theſe wordes can be prouen conſtant, and true. I haue (ſaith he) appointed you to go and to bring fourthe frute,
                        Iohn. 15. & that your frute ſhal abyde. The ſtabilitie and truth (I ſay) of this promeſſe dothe not ſodenly appeare, but rather the playne contrary. For if the frute of the Goſpel

and glad tydinges preached be firſt in this lyfe the glorye of God (I meane ſuch good workes as may declare the ſpirite of regeneration) ſhining in man after that he be planted in Chriſt Ieſus, and after this battel the ioy prepared for Gods children: if theſe (I ſay) be the frutes of Chriſt Ieſus preached, then appeare the moſt parte of trees to be deſtroyed before the tyme of frute dothe approche. For ſome by tyrannie and violence are rooted out frome the ſocietie of earthely creatures before they beginne to floriſh, & ſo is their frute to mās iudgement impeaded and hindered, ſome are blaſted and wythered withe ſtormy windes and ſome are corrupted ether by vermine, or by venemous humors proceding frome a corrupt fountayne, ſo that the frute of none almoſt dothe appere to our eyes.

To ſpeake the matter ſimply and without figure, the men that appeared to the faithfull laborers to haue bene planted in Chriſt, who callethe him ſelf the verie vyne, and thoſe, that profeſſe his truthe, the vine branches, are ſubiect to ſo many tentacions, that ſkarſely emongſt a thowſand dothe one take roote and bring forthe frute with paciēce.

                        Eſai. 57. For the prophet Eſai pronounceth that the iuſt periſheth (ſo dothe it appere to mās iudgement) and yet that no

man putteth it in harte, that is dothe earneſtly conſider it, that the men of mercie are taken awaye and the worlde neuertheles dothe reioyce and tryumphe. But the holy ghoſt aſſigneth an other cawſe,The frute and benifite of deathe vnto the iuſt. that the iuſt is taken away before that his eyes behold greater miſeries, that he entreth into his peace before that Gods vengeance beginne to be powred forthe vpon the prowde and diſobedient,

Ye feared not to go before ſtatutes and lawes, yea openly and ſolemnedly you dyd profeſſe by receiuing the ſacramentes not as mā had appointed, but as Chriſt Ieſus the wiſdome of God the father had inſtitute to be ſubiect in al thinges concerning religiō to his yoke alone, to acknowledg and auouche him before ye world to be your onely lawe gyuer, ſoueraigne prince and onely ſauiour. Thus I ſay ye appeared at that tyme, to haue bene the delicate plantes of the Eternal, the workemanſhip of his owne handes, and the trees that in ſeaſon and tyme ſhulde haue produced good frute in abundance.

O conſider deare brethren, what grief it is, that in ſuche a multitude none ſhalbe found faithful,In the tyme of perſecution and tryal not one was foūd faithful and conſtant. none conſtant, none bolde in the cawſe of the Lorde Ieſus, whome ſo boldlye before they had profeſſed.
                  God is witneſſe, and I refuſe not your owne iudgmentes,

how ſimplye & vprightly I conuerſed and walked amongſt you, thogh in his preſence I was and am nothing, but a maſſe of corruption, rebellion and hypocriſie: yet as cōcerning you and the doctrine taght amongſt you, as then I walked, ſo nowe do I write in the preſence of him, who onely knoweth & ſhal reueale ye ſecretes of all hartes,This rule oght of all preachers to be obſerued. yt nether for feare dyd I ſpare to ſpeake the ſimple truthe vnto you, nether for hope of worldly promotion, dignitie or honour dyd I willingly adulterate any parte of Gods ſcriptures whether it were in expoſitiō, in preaching, contention or writing: but that ſimply & plainly, as it pleaſed the merciful goodnes of my God to giue vnto me the vtterāce, vnderſtanding & ſpirite, I dyd diſtribute the bread of lyfe (I meane Gods moſt holy worde) as of

Chriſt Ieſus I had receiued it. I ſoght nether preheminence,Beholde wherein the preachers of Chriſt ſhulde reioyce. glorie, nor riches: my honour was, that Chriſt Ieſus ſhuld reigne: my glorie, that the light of his truthe ſhuld ſhyne in you: and my greateſt riches, that in the ſame ye ſhuld be conſtant. Let him amongſt you that is fartheſt declined, conuict me if he can, if that euer he dyd perceyue me by craftie or vnlawfull meanes to ſeke the ſubſtance or riches of any, yea if I haue not refuſed that, which by diuers hathe bene offred, and that alſo by the commone opinion might lawfully haue bene receyued. But to what purpoſe is this recited? Is it to brag of mine owne iuſtice? or yet to defende mine owne innocencie? not ſo deare bretherne, not ſo (for what I acknowledge my ſelf to be before God, I haue already confeſſed)

but to let you vnderſtand, that if I haue this teſtimonie of cōſcience as concerning my office, miniſterie and doctrine, & am notwithſtanding wounded almoſt to the deathe for that that my labors haue not better ſucceded,If he that is innocent hath this feare, howe oght the offenders, to tremble? what oght to be your feare, lamē

I feare that God hathe curſed me becauſe he hathe not better bleſſed my labors amongſt you, and yet in that behalf haue I the lot, and ſort cōmune withe the moſt parte of Gods true Prophetes, and the conditiō like with ſainct Paul to cōfort me in my greateſt deſperation.3.

But we are out of dāger: deſtruction nor deathe ſhal not apprehende vs. The accompliſhement of their viſions are far of: Ieruſalē is the pott, & we are the fleſh, meaning therby, that they wolde dye & lyue in their natiue country. But the prophets boldely againſt ſuche prowde contempt dyd affirme, that their leage and couenāt made (as they ſuppoſed) with deathe and vaſtacion ſhulde be diſſolued and broken. For the floods of vengeance ſhulde cary them to perdition:

Iohannan the ſonne of Carea; & Iezanias the ſōne of Hoſeas with the whole people had promiſed vnto Ieremie by a ſolemned othe to do whatſoeuer the Lord ſhulde commaunde vnto them by his mouthe: yet when he commaunded thē in the name of the Lord to abyde in the lande and not to carie the people to Egypt, they nether feared, nor aſhamed to ſay vnto him, thou ſpeakeſt a lye, the Lord hath not ſent the to vs, commaūding that we ſhulde not go to Egypt,

And therfore he gaue them: moſt ſtrait commandement, that they ſhulde neuer returne to that bondage agayne.

For it may be that in ſpeaking the ſimple trueth I may diſpleaſe thoſe, whome willingly for no earthly profet I wold offende. Neuertheles ſeing the cauſe is not myne, but perteyneth to Chriſt Ieſus, and to the feeding of that flocke, which ſo earneſtly and tenderly he dyd commend to Peter,

Secondly that-benefice vpon benefice be heaped vpō no mā, but that a ſufficient charge with a competent ſtipend be aſsigned to the workeman. For ô how horrible was that cōfuſiō,Pluralitie of benefices reproued. that one man ſhulde be permitted to haue 2.3.4.5.6. or. 7. benifices, who ſkarſely in the yeare dyd ſo often preache: yea, that a man ſhulde haue the charge of them, whoſe faces he neuer ſaw. Let that peſtilence, proceading from auarice, be vtterly auoyded. Let not men at their pleaſures preach when and where they liſt, but ſo ſone as a Godly order

may be eſtabliſhed, let the partes and bondes be aſsigned to euery one. Londō in tymes paſt was indifferently prouided for,
                        London.
                      but alas what barbarous ignorāce was in the reſt of the Realme.
                  Thirdly let no man be charged in preaching of Chriſt Ieſus aboue that, which one man may do, I meane, that your Biſhoprikes be ſo deuided, that of euery one, as they be nowe (for the moſt part) be made ten, and ſo in euery Citie and great towne there may be placed a godly learned man with ſo many ioyned with him ſo preaching and inſtruction, as ſhalbe thoght ſufficient for the bondes committed to their charge. The vtilitie wherof you ſhal vnderſtand within few yeares greatly to redoūde to the profit of ye ſimple flocke.The great dominions and charge of prowde prelats is the inuention of Antichriſt. For your prowde prelates great dominiōs & charge (impoſsible by one man to be

diſcharged) are no parte of chriſts miniſterie, but are the maintenā

                  Fortely that diligent hede be taken, that ſuch, to whome the office of preaching is committed, diſcharge and do their dueties. For it is not, nor wil not be, the chanting or mumbling ouer of certeyne pſalmes, the reading of Chapiters for mattens and euen ſong, or of homelies onely, be they neuer ſo godly, that fede the ſoules of the hugrie ſhepe.

                     And as touching execution of diſcipline,Diſcipline muſt be executed without reſpect of perſōs that muſt be done ī euerie Citie & Shier, where ye Magiſtrates & miniſters are ioyned together without any reſpect of perſons, ſo yt the miniſters, albeit they lack the glorious titles of Lordes, & the deueliſh pompe, wc before appeared in proude prelates, yet muſt they be ſo ſtowte & ſo bolde in Gods cauſe,The Miniſters muſt be ſtowt and bolde in Gods cauſe albeit they wāt the glorious & vayne titles of Lordes. that yf the King him ſelf wolde vſurpe any other autoritie in Gods religion, then becometh a membre of Chriſts body, that firſt he be admoniſhed accordīg to Gods worde, and after, yf he contemne the ſame, be ſubiect to the yoke of diſcipline, to whome they ſhal boldly ſaye, as Aſarias the highe preſte ſayd to Vſaias the king of Iuda:3. Par. 26. It is not lawful for the, ô Vſaia, to offer incenſe, but it apperteyneth to the preſtes the ſonnes of Aharon, who are conſecrated

to burne it. Paſſe out therfore, for thou haſt offended,4. King. 26 which thing ſhal not redounde to thy glorie, &c.
