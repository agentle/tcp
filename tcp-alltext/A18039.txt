North doore of
Poules.
1573.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               FOR thee O London I lament,
               And wring my hāds with mourning chere
               Becauſe that thou wilt not repent,
               Seyng thy deſtruction draweth nere.
               If it be true as ſcriptures tell:
               Thy ſynnes will ſincke thee doune to hell.
            
            
               The vices whiche in thee are vſed,
               To tedious are for me to tell:
               Thy noble fame is ſore abuſed,
               By thoſe whiche in thee now doe dwell.
               Whereby I ſee thy greate decaie,
               That God doeth threaten thee eche daie.
            
            
               The vice of pride hath tane ſuche place,
               That it can not be rooled out:
               And hath continued ſo long ſpace,
               That of Gods ire thou haſt no doubt.
               And ſuche a place pride doeth ſupplie,
               That from thee it will neuer flie.
            
            
               For like a weede it vp doeth ſpryng,
               It is not ſet nor ſowen at all:
               The whiche good herbes & fruictes will bryng
               Ere thei be ripe vnto a fall.
               To cut it doune it is no boote,
               Except ye cleane plucke vp the roote.
            
            
               
               For where this wéede doeth ſpring & grow
               Good fruictes can not there proſpere well:
               Becauſe that cruelneſſe ſo doeth flowe,
               That verteous herbes it doeth excell.
               Whiche weede we maie cōpare to pride,
               That cauſeth vertue awaie to ſlide.
            
            
               So likewiſe Pride in London now,
               Doeth floriſhe in ſuche goodly ſorte:
               That thei muent whiche waie and how,
               Thereby augmented it might be.
               And nothyng doe regarde at all,
               That Pride in the ende will haue a fall.
            
            
               Conſider well that Pride hath been,
               The fall of many cities greate:
               And Sodom ſonke for ſuche like ſynne,
               As ſacred ſcriptures doeth repete.
               Gomorrha eke came to decaie,
               Becauſe that Pride did beare the ſwaie.
            
            
               And Alexandria in like cace,
               Whiche was a citie ſtrong and greate:
               Pride would not let them purchaſe gracer
               Nor yet for mercie would intreate.
               Becauſe that Pride ſo muche did flowe,
               It was deſtroied and lies full lowe.
            
            
               
               And Niniuie like cauſe I finde,
               In the ende for Pride was cleane deſtroied,
               For Pride ſo muche did puffe their minde,
               That God was cleane forgot and voide.
               In Pride ſo muche thei did delite,
               That God the ſame deſtroied quite.
            
            
               Ieruſalem that citie ſtrong,
               Pride would not let them God to knowe,
               In whiche Pride thei contined long,
               As Ioſephus the ſame doeth ſhowe.
               Till Titus did deſtrote the ſame,
               And did accuſe their pride with ſhame.
            
            
               Enſample take by noble Troie,
               The like for pride was neuer ſene:
               With warres the Grekes did it deſtroie,
               Bothe wall and houſe the threwe doune clene
               Becauſe that Pride did beare the ſwaie,
               It came to ruine and decaie.
            
            
               Therefore, O London, now take heede,
               For thou waſt called Troic ſometyme:
               That ſuche decaie doeth not procede,
               For to reuenge of Pride the crime.
               Therefore repent, from Pride refraine,
               Leſt as Troie did, thou feele ſome paine.
            
            
               
               For God doeth threaten thy greate fall,
               By ſignes and tokens many waies:
               The whiche vnto thee happen ſhall,
               Shortly Chriſt ſaieth, and that in fewe daies,
               Therefore his power diuine to pleaſe,
               Repent, his ire thou ſhalt appeaſe.
            
            
               O London, thou haſt cauſe to weepe,
               For to conſider thyne eſtate:
               Thou art in ſynne now drounde ſo deepe,
               That from hell mouthe thou cauſt not ſcape.
               Except repentaunce thou embrace,
               At Gods hande thou ſhalt finde no grace.
            
            
               To practiſe pride thou doeſt delight,
               And fonde deuiſes for to gaine:
               Whiche is eſtemed all in Gods ſight,
               A thyng moſte friuolous and vaine.
               Yet thou doeſt ſeke the ſame to vſe,
               Whiche doeth thy noble fame abuſe.
            
            
               Let this a reformation be,
               For thee, that thou in tyme repent:
               Whereby thou mightſt haue grace to flee,
               From Pride, the Lordes will to content.
               Reuolue in mynde what happen ſhall,
               For Pride in the ende will haue a fall.
            
            Finis.

            ¶A caueat or warnyng
to Englande.
            
               THe preſent plagues, that now we fele,
            our ioyes deeth muche incroche:
            And feare of forrein foes beſides,
            who ſeeke for to approche.
            To woorke annoye to Britaine ſoile,
            but Ioue bee thankte therefore:
            That hath diſlodgde the treaſen now,
            whiche Curia kepte in ſtore:
            The hidden ſparkes haue winde diſperſte,
            the ſmoke hath ſhowne her fire:
            And driſtyng Yris hath conſtrainde,
            the furious flambes retire.
            That long within Rammuſius breaſte,
            in couerte cloſe did lurke:
            Pretendyng naught but Princes fall,
            and Englandes woe to woorke.
            For outwarde face maie ſimple ſeme,
            where ſauour doeth affecte:
            And Wolfe beyng cladde in Lambes arraie,
            who can at firſte ſuſpecte.
            Till gredie iawes to woorke decaie,
            of ſillie Lambes doe thirſte:
            And doeth retourne to vomite olde,
            from whence he came at firſte.
            But tyme hath tride what coloured crafte,
            
               
ſimplicitie long did cloke:
            And rooted vp ſuche weedes as crſte,
            good corne haue ſought to choke.
            The gardner hath her ſickle ſharpte,
            to plucke vp all ſuche ſeedes:
            As to the eye doe fruictfull ſeme,
            and yet are ſtinckyng weedes.
            Whoſe barrein braunche as fertile ſemde,
            to thoſe that ſimple were,
            In eche reſpecte as did the tree,
            that yerely fruicte did beare.
            But he whiche firſt did plant thoſe trees,
            in this our Engliſhe lande:
            And did aſſigne the Gardener ſhe,
            to take the chardge in hande:
            Hath ſhowne her grace, where ſhe ſhall graft
            and where that ſhe ſhall roote:
            Accordyng as affection ſerues,
            to ſnche as yelde no fruite.
            And leaſt that ſoile hereafter ſhould,
            his force againe renewe:
            And holeſome herbes in Englande ſowne,
            ſhould forrein weedes ſubdue.
            Her grace in hande the ſickle holdes,
            to croppe ſuche ympes in tyme:
            Leaſt if ſhe ſtaie as erſte ſhe did,
            thei happe to high to climbe.
            
               
Though that our gracious Prince doeth loth,
            to yelde the fatall ſtroke:
            To thoſe that by deſertes might muche,
            her highneſſe ire prouoke.
            With edged tooles ſeme not to ieſte,
            moue not your Prince to muche:
            Leaſte that the edge doe tourne and cutte,
            when you the ſame doe touche.
            Let eche degree obeye their Prince,
            as duetie hath aſſinde:
            Good Englande watche and looke aboute,
            there comes a plague behinde.
            That more will vexe then ſickneſſe doeth,
            repent therefore with ſpede:
            Leaſte God for thy inceſtious life,
            to take reuenge procede.
            O worthie Prince as erſte thou haſte,
            the Gospelles might maintained:
            And haſte redreſte the poore mans cauſe,
            whiche hath for right complainde.
            Ronoumed Prince euen ſo I craue,
            forſee thy ſubiectes woes:
            And yelde reuenge to ſuche as wiſhe,
            thy Croune to forrein foes.
            Excepte the deedes of ſuche in tyme,
            as hollowe hartes poſſeſſe:
            In woordes true ſubiectes to your grace,
            
               
in deedes mynde nothyng leſſe.
            O Lorde cutte of ſuche impes in tyme,
            and ſende your grace tranquilitie:
            God graunt the nobles maie incline,
            to yelde your grace humilitie.
            God graunt the Goſpell good ſucceſſe,
            and Cleargie for to preache:
            The ſincire truthe as Chriſt hym ſelf,
            was wonte the ſame to teache.
            Doe Antichriſte confounde (O Lorde)
            bryng Rome to deſolation:
            And doe preſerue Elizabeth,
            The Queene of Engliſhe nation.
            Illuminate the Commons eyes,
            that thei maie walke their path:
            And graunte the magiſtrate to vſe,
            the office that he hath.
            And to this citie graunt (O God)
            lorde Maior with his fraternitie:
            Degreſſe nothyng from Princes will,
            but ioyne as one in vnitie.
            God proſpere her, God length her raigne,
            from harmes her grace God ſaue:
            Poore Phillippes he with guſhyng teares,
            doeth thus deſire to haue

                  BItterly and earneſtly,
               Before thy mightie maieſtie,
               On knees I fall,
               And crie and call,
               For mercie Lorde vnfainedly.
               Daie and night, before thy ſight,
               My ſynfull life I doe recite,
               And craue for grace,
               For to imbrace,
               Whiche is my chief and hartes delight.
               And I with humble reuerence,
               Doe craue thy pardon for myne offence:
               Thy mercie eke, oh Lorde I ſeeke,
               With humble ſoule, and harte moſte meeke.
            
            
               What am I oh kyng moſte hye,
               That thus by myne iniquitie,
               I ſhould prouoke,
               Thy heauie ſtroke,
               To puniſhe me ſo greuouſlie.
               Myne offence, and negligence:
               Hath monde to wrathe thy patience:
               Whiche now in haſte,
               I feele and taſte,
               By proofe and plaine experience.
               But Lorde though I haue ſynned ſore,
               
                  
Yet ſlea me not in anger therefore:
               Nor in thyne yre, I thee deſire,
               Condempne my ſoule to endleſſe fire.
            
            
               Worthely, vndoubtedly,
               I haue deſerude extremely,
               And trode the pathe:
               Right to thy wrathe,
               Suche was my weake infirmitie,
               Sathan hath ſo blinded me:
               That I forſooke thee vtterly,
               And by his arte,
               He dulde my harte,
               That I had quite forgotten thee.
               And did let ſlippe out of my mynde,
               Thy benefits and fauour ſo kynde:
               Thy mercie moſte, oh Lorde of hoſte.
               The perfecte reſte to greeued ghoſte.
            
            
               Caſte thyne eyes, from chriſtall ſkies,
               Vpon my ſtate, and heare my cries,
               I doe repente,
               With harts conſent,
               Therefore my ſuite doe not deſpiſe.
               Heale my wounde, and make me ſounde:
               Leaſt feare of hell my ſprits confounde,
               Reſpecte my caſe,
               
                  
And graunte thy grace,
               That hope of healthe maie once abounde.
               And that the ſtormes of death and ſynne.
               Maie not in me ſuche victorie winne:
               That I at laſte, when healthe is paſte,
               In euerlaſtyng paines be caſte.
            
            
               Pitie me and ſuccour me,
               Oh God of thy benignitie,
               I doe intende,
               For to amende,
               And flie from ſynne vnfainedlie,
               
                  Ʋtterly, I will defie,
               To runne my race ſo wickedlie.
               As here tofore,
               I haue full ſore
               The greater grief aſſuredlie.
               But though I be a wicked wight,
               By true repentaunce pardon me quite:
               For God aboue, as ſcriptures proue,
               A contrite harte doeth daiely loue.
            
            
               Though my ſynne, ſo vile hath been,
               That iudgement iuſte, the ſame doeth win
               Yet ſince I due,
               My ſelf renewe.
               And to repent my fault beginne.
               
                  
Offer grace, for I imbrace,
               A broken harte in preſent place:
               And I deteſte,
               With conſtaunte breaſte.
               The woorks of ſynne before thy face.
               All deeds of darkneſſe I defie,
               And to thy waies my footſteppes applie:
               Thou art my towre of healthe eche hower,
               I force not then for Sathans power.
            
            
               Mercifull and pitifull,
               Thou art vnto the ſorowfull,
               To ſuche as bee,
               Conuerte to thee,
               Thou ſhowſte thy graces plentifull.
               Scripture ſaieth, that onely faithe,
               Doeth quenche thy hot and burning wrath
               Whiche kindled is,
               I knowe well this.
               Againſt the man that treades the pathe.
               Of wicked life, and vnbelefe,
               And other ſynnes ingendreth grefe:
               And will conſtraine perpetuall paine.
               Excepte from ſynne he doe refraine,
            
            
               Therefore I vnſainedlie,
               Acknowledge myne iniquitie,
               
                  
And now I craue,
               Thy grace to haue,
               And mercie in this miſerie.
               Feare of hell doeth me compell,
               My ſynnes with tricklyng teares to tell,
               Thy heauie hande,
               I vnderſtande,
               And all thy ſkourges fearce and fell.
               Wherewith thou haſt from tyme to tyme,
               Corrected ſuche as fell into cryme:
               And did tranſgreſſe thy lawes no leſſe,
               Whereto we ought our liues adreſſe.
            
            
               Wilfulneſſe in wickedneſſe,
               Is moſte extreme vngodlineſſe:
               The man that doeth,
               Againſt all truthe,
               Reſiſt of ſturdie ſtubborneſſe,
               He I ſaie, a ſore decaie:
               Shall taſte, as one quite caſt awaie,
               In endleſſe paine,
               There to remaine,
               As vnto hell a laſtyng praie,
               Where with the glotton he ſhall taſte,
               In Limbo lake, ſore tormentes in haſte:
               Where he ſhall crie with voice on hie,
               With Diues, till his tonge be dzie.
            
            
               
               Whiles the ſame, to mynde I frame,
               I call vpon thy holie name,
               My ſynne I leaue,
               To thee I cleaue,
               And eke my wanton fleſhe I tame.
               Makyng mone to thee alone,
               With many a ſigh, and many a grone,
               For my miſdeede,
               Whiche doe exceede:
               And ſtincke before thy chriſtall throne.
               My ſynnes like Skarlet ſeme in ſight,
               Oh make them Lorde, like woll very white,
               Like Purple thei appeare I ſaie,
               But thou like Milke canſt them conuaie.
            
            
               Dauid iuſte did not miſtruſte,
               Thy mercie when he kneeled in duſte,
               And on his backe,
               A hearie ſacke,
               Did weare, as ſcripture haue diſcuſte.
               Greuouſlie and bitterlie,
               Confeſſyng his adulterie:
               His murther eke,
               With mynde moſte meke,
               When Nathan true did prophecie.
               The plague of God againſt hym than,
               Excepte to tourne forthwith he began:
               
                  
So Dauids harte, for feare of ſmart.
               By true repentaunce did conuarte.
            
            
               God forgaue and did hym ſaue,
               From vengaūce iuſt, whiche ſinne did craue
               Oh deale with me,
               So tenderlie,
               That Dauids reſt my ſoule maie haue.
               For no doubt, I goe aboute,
               To tourne from ſynne that deadly route,
               From bloudie Saule:
               To faithfull Paule,
               I bridle ill affections ſtoute.
               Whiche did reſtraine my harte and minde,
               From thee my maker louyng and kinde:
               And did withdrawe the feare and awe,
               Preſcribed in thy holie lawe.
            
            
               I confeſſe with ſingleneſſe,
               My former vile vngodlineſſe:
               And I deſpiſe,
               With wepyng eyes,
               The deadly waies of wickeneſſe.
               Whiche I tooke,
               And ſo forſooke,
               The waie of life without rebuke,
               To Chriſtians all in generall,
               
                  
The glorious gaines whereon to looke.
               Whiche waie who ſo doeth walke a right,
               He ſhall attaine the heauenly light:
               And for rewarde of his regarde,
               A bleſſed croune there is preparde.
            
            
               Hope of this eternall bliſſe,
               Hath made me leaue to runne amiſſe,
               And ſhonne the waie,
               Whiche brynges decaie,
               The ends whereof deſtruction is.
               Paine and woe,
               As ſcriptures ſhowe,
               With euerlaſtyng ouerthrowe:
               And therefore I this paines to die,
               Submit my ſoule, and ſeke to knowe.
               That narrowe gate of bliſſed ſtate,
               Where is no ſtrief nor any debate,
               But ioye alwaies with perfecte praiſe,
               Oh God vouchſafe my ſoule to raiſe.
            
            
               Though I be vnkinde to thee,
               In mercie father pardon me,
               And though my race,
               Be voide of grace,
               Yet graunt that I, thy loue maie ſee.
               Though we begonne, yet Lorde anone.
               
                  
Vouchſafe that I with Simeon,
               Maie ſee my wealthe,
               And ſauyng healthe,
               I meane that ſtedfaſt corner ſtone.
               Whiche of the builders was refuſed,
               And in their deedes moſte ſpitefully vſed:
               This ſtone was Chriſt that kyngly Prieſte,
               That with his bloud our ſoules hath bleſte.
            
            
               Greuouſly and bitterlie,
               Beholde my greate aduerſitie,
               Wherein I ſtande:
               Bounde with the bande,
               Of ſynne, and ſore captiuitie.
               Haſte then thyne eares to bowe,
               To me oppreſt with ſorrowe nowe.
               On thee in haſte,
               My care I caſte,
               My praiers Lorde in faithe alowe.
               Oh let my plaints the heauens pearſe,
               And here the ſuite whiche I doe rehearſe:
               Tourne not awaie thy face I praie,
               But ſaue my ſoule from hells decaie.
            
            
               Sathan ſtill, by wicked will,
               Would tourne my hope from Syon hill:
               Whiche to attaine,
               
                  
I pitche with paine:
               The tents of faithe, though deuill nill.
               Temptyng me, to diſagree,
               From confidence, oh Lorde in thee,
               And to miſtruſte:
               Thy promiſe iuſte,
               Whiche vnto ſynners ſhewed be.
               But thou my God, make weake his ſtrength,
               Leaſt he by craft, ſubdue me at length:
               For I am weake, in ſpirite I ſpeake,
               All Sathans ſlightes in ſonder breake.
            
            
               Subtilie and craftelie,
               He ſekes by deuelliſhe pollicie:
               To clogge my feete,
               In pathes vnmeete,
               And walke in waies of vanitie.
               Stedfaſtlie and zealouſlie,
               I will adore thy Maieſtie:
               And eke prepare,
               To fixe my care,
               Vpon thy mercie faithfullie.
               Thus doyng ſtill, I hope by faithe,
               Thou wilt tranſlate, to fauour thy wrathe:
               And clenſe my ſpotte, and purge the blotte,
               That all my faults maie be forgotte.
            
            
               
               Harte and tonge, and greues emong,
               Shall ſyng as holie Dauid ſong,
               The Pſalmes of praiſe:
               To thee alwaies,
               Before aſſemblies olde and yong.
               Feruentlie and ardentlie,
               My lipps thy praiſe ſhall teſtifie,
               Bothe yonge and olde:
               With hartes moſte bolde,
               Thy holie name ſhall magnifie.
               And I with thankes will aye commende,
               Thy woorkes & wōders, world without ende,
               Let all adore with me therefore,
               Thy name be praiſde for euermore.
            
            Finis.
