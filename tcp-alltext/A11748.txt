               THE Present troubles
being somewhat
cōsiddered (but greater
feared shortly to
follow) it wes thoght
expedient (dearelie beloued
in the Lord Iesus) that the whole

Faithfull Within this Realme,
shuld together, and at one time
prostrat them selues before their
God, crauing of him pardone and
mercy for the great abuse of his
former benefites, and the assistance
of his holy Spirite, by whose mightie
operation we may yet so conuert
to our God, that we prouoke him
not to take from vs the lyght of
his Euangle, which he of his mercie
hath caused so clearly of laite
dayes to shine within this realme.
But because that suche publicte
Supplicationes requyre alwayes
Fasting to be ioyned therewith,
And publict Fastynge craueth
a certane time and certane exercises
of godlynes then to be vsed with
greater streatnes then at vther tymes.
The whole Assemblie after
deliberation hath appointed y• last
Sonday of February, and the first
Sonday of Marche nixt following
the date of the said assemblie, to
that moste necessare exercise (as

tyme now standeth) of publict
Fasting. And further, did require
the same to be signified be all Ministers
to their people the Sonday
preceading the said last Sonday of
Februarie. But lest that the Papistes
shall think that now we begine
to authorise and praise that
which some tymes we haue reproued
and dampned in them. Or
els that the ignorant who knowe
not the commoditie of this moste
godlie exercise shall contempne ye
same. We haue thoght expedient
somewhat to speak to the one and
to the vther. And vnto the
Papistes first we say, that as in puritie
of conscience, we haue refused
their whole abhominationes, and
amongest the rest, that their supersticious
and Pharisaicall maner of
Fasting: So euen vnto this day do
we continew in the same purpose,
boldely affirming that their Fasting
is no Fasting that euer God
approued, but that it is a deceauing

of the people, and a meare mocking
of God, which moste euidentlie
will appeare. If in the Scriptures
we searche what is the ryght
end of Fasting, what Fasting pleased
God, and which is it that his
soule abhoreth. Of Fasting in the
Scriptures we finde two sortes, the
one priuate, the vther publicte.
The priuate is that which man or
woman doeth in secrete, & before
their God, for such causes as their
owen conscience beareth record vnto
them. As Dauid during the time
that his Sone which wes begotten
in adulterie, wes struken with mortall
seicknes, fasted, weap
                  •
               , and lay
vpon the ground, because that in
the seicknes of the Chylde he did
considder Godes displeasure agains
him self for the remouing, whereof
he fasted, murned, & prayed,
vnto suche tyme as he saw Godes
wil fulfilled by the awaytaking of
the Chylde Priuatlie fasted Anna,
wyse to Alcana, euen in the verray

Solempne Feastes, during the
tyme of hir barrennes. For she
weapt and eat nothing,1. Sam. 
                     •
                  . but in the
bitternes of hir heart she prayed
vnto the Lord, nether ceased she
from sorow and murning, vnto
suche tyme as Eli the hie Preist
concurred with her in prayers, by
whose mouth after that he had
hard her petifull complaint, she
receaued conforte. Of this Fasting
speaketh oure M
                  ••
               ister Iesus
Christ in these wordes, when ye
Fast, be not sowr as the Hypocretes,
for they disfigure their faces,Math. 6.
that they may some vnto men
to Fast. But thow when thow
Fastest, anoynt thy heade, and
washe thy face, that thow seame
not vnto men to Fast, but vnto thy
Father which seeth in secrete, and
will rewarde the opinly. Of the
same no dout speaketh y• Apostle
when that he sayeth, defraude not
one another,1. Cor. 7. except it be with cō
               sent
for a tyme, that ye may giue

your selues to Fasting and prayer.
To this priuate Fasting which stā
               deth
chiefly in a temperat, dyet, &
in powring furthe of our secrete
thoughtes and necessities before
God, can be prescriued no certane
rule, certane tyme, nor certane ceremonies,
but as the causes and occasiones
why that exercise is vsed
are diuers (yea so diuers that seldome
it is that many at ones are
moued with one cause) so are diet,
tyme, together with all vther circumstances
requyred to suche Fasting,
put in the libertie of them
that vse it. To this Fasting we
haue bene faithfully and earnestly
exhorted by oure Preachers, as
oft as the Scriptures which they
entreated offered vnto them occasion.
And we dout not but the
godlie within this Realme haue
vsed the same as necessitie craued,
albeit with the Papistes we blew
no Trumpetes, to appoynt thereto
certane dayes.
            
               
The vther kynde of Fasting is
publict so called, because that it
is openlie awowed, some tymes of
a Realme, some tymes of a multitude,
some tymes of a cietie, and
some tymes of a meaner company,
yea, some tymes of particulare
persones, and yet publictlie vsed,
and that for the wealth of a multitude.
The causes thereof are also
diuers,Causes that ought to moue men to publict
                     •
                   Fasting. for sometymes the feare of
ennimies, sometymes the angrie
face of God punishing, sometymes
his threatning to distroy, some
tymes iniquitie deprehended that
ryghtlie before wes not considered,
and sometymes the earnest
zeale that some beare for preseruation
of Godes people, for aduā
               cing
of his glorie, & performing of
his worke, according to his promes,
moue men to publict Fasting,
confession of their sinnes, &
solempned prayers, for defence
against their ennimies, recouering
of Godes fauoures, remouing of

his plagues, preseruatiō of his people,
& setting fordwarde of that
work
                  •
               , which he hath of his merce
promised to finishe, as in the subsequent
probationes euidētly shall
appeare. ¶When Messingers
came to Iosaphat saying, there
cometh a great multitude against
thee from beyond the sea, out of
Aram (that is Syria) &c. Iosaphat
feared,2. Parali. 20 and set him self to seke the
Lord, and proclamed a Faste throughout
all Iuda. And Iuda gathered
them selues together, to aske
counsall of the Lord, they come
euen out of all the cieties of Iuda
to inquire of the Lord. And Iosaphat
stoode in the Congregariō
of Iuda, and Ierusalem in the hou;
of the Lord, before the new court,
And all Iuda stoode before the
Lord with their yonge ones, their
wyfes and their Chyldrene. And
Iosaphat said, ô Lord God of our
Fathers, are not thow God in heauen,
and reignest not thow in all

Kingdomes of the Heathen? And
in thy hand is power and myght,The prayer of Iosaphat
and none is able to withstād thee.
Haste not thow our God cast out
the inhabitantes of this Land, before
thy people Israell, and haste
giuen it to the s
                  ••
               d of Abraham
thy freand for euer. &c. But now
the Ammorytes, and Moabytes,
& the Mont Seir ar come to castvs
out of thy possession? O Lord our
God shall thow not iudge them?
In vs there is no strengh to stand
against this great multitude that
commeth against vs, nether knowe
we what to do, but vnto thee are
our eyes bent. &c. Of this Historie
we haue the first cause of publict
Fasting, and the solempnitie
thereof sufficiently prowen. For
the feare of ennimies cōpelled Iosaphat
to seik the Lord, he knowing
him selfe burdened with the
care of the people, exhorted them
to do the same. They fra all cieties
and quarters repared to Ierusalem,

whereupone a statute day
the King and the people, yea, wyues
and Childrene presented them
selues before the Lord in his holy
Temple,The ceremo

                   of publict

                   fasting exponed their necessitie,

                  •
               lpe against that
enraged multitude, that alwayes
wes ennimie to Godes people, &
gaue open confession of their owē
weaknes, leaning onely to the promes
and protection of the omnipotent.
Which exemple, we &
euerie people likewyse assaulted,
may and ought to follow in euerie
poynt. This onely excepted, that
we are not bound to conuen
                  •
                at
any one appoynted place, as they
did at Ierusalem. For to no one certane
and seuerall place is that promes
made, that then wes made to
the Temple of Ierusalem,The promeis made to the temple of Ierusalē is now to be soght in Christe lesus. which
wes that whatsoeuer men in their
extremitie shuld ask of God in it,
God shuld grant it from his holie
habitation in the heauen. Iesus
the Messias then looked for,Hebr. 7. whose

presence wes sought in the merci

seat, and betuix the Cherubinnes,
is now entered within the vale,
that is in the heauen, and there abydeth
onely Mediator for vs, vnto
whome from all the coastes of
the earth, we may lift vp pure handes,
direct our prayers,
                  
                     •
                   Time. 
                     •
                  
                supplicationes,
and complaintes, and be
assured that they shalbe receaued,
in whatsoeuer place we conuene.
And yet in tyme of suche publict
exercyses, we wold wishe that all
men and wemen shuld repare to
suche places as their conscience
may be best instructed, their Faith
moste edified, repentance moste
liuely sturred vp in them, and they
by Godes worde may be moste assured
that their iust peticions shall
not be repelled. Which thinges
cā not be done so liuely in secrete
and priuate meditatī, as that they
are in publict Assemblie, where
Christ Iesus is trewly preached, &
this muche shortlie for the firste

head. Of the second, to wit, that
the angrie face of God punishing,
aught to dryue vs to publicte Fasting,
& humiliation of our soules
before our God, we haue two notable
exemples, the one written in
Iosua, who hearing and vnderstanding,
that Israell had turned the
back before the Cananite▪ and the
Elders of Israell rent their clothes,Iosua. 7.
fell vpone their faces before the
Arke of the Lord vnto the nyght,
and caste dust vpone their heades,
in signe of their humiliation and
deiection. The vther is expressed
in the booke of the Iudges,
where Israell being commanded
by God to fight against Beniamin,Iudi. 20.
because that they menteaned wicked
men that deserued death, loste
the first day twentie two thousand
of their armie, and the second day
eightene thousand. At the firste
lose they were 
                  ••
               ghtlie touched,
and asked counsall if they shulde
rene
                  •
               , the battell, but at the secōd

ouerthrow, the whole people repared
vnto the hous of the Lord,
sat there, weapt before the Lord,
& Fasted that day vnto the night,
for then began they to considder
Godes angrie face against them.
            In this last historie their appeareth
iust cause why the people shulde
haue rune to the onely refuge of
God, because that there first army
of fourtie thousand men wes vtterlie
distroyed. But what iust
occasion had Iosua so lamentablie
to complaine,Let his cō
                  plaint be noted. yea, so boldely as it
were to accuse God, that he had
deceaued him in that, that against
his promeis he had suffered Israell
to fall before their ennimies. Wes
the lose of thrette men (no mo sel
that day in the edge of the sword)
so great a mater that he shuld dispare
of any better successe, that he
shulde accuse God that he had
brought them ouer Iordane, and
that he shuld feare that the whole
army of the Lord shuld be inueroned

aboute, and consumed in the
rage of their ennimies, yea, if Israell
had onely looked no further
then to the lose of the fourty thousand
men, they had bene but feable
Soldioures, for they had sufficient
strenth remaning behinde,
for what were fourtie thousand, in
respect of all the trybes of Israel?
Nay, nay (deare brethren) it wes
an vther thing then the present
lose that terrified & effrayed their
consciences, and made them so
effeminatlie (so wold fleshe iudge)
to complaine, weap, and owle before
God, to wit, they saw his angrie
face against them, they saw his
hand fortifie their ennimies, and
to fight against them, whome both
he had commanded to fight, and
had promised to giue them victorie.Eue
                     •
                  ie commandement of god to do any thing, hes the sccrete promes of his assistance.
For euerie commandement
of God to do any thing against his
ennimies, hath included within it a
secrete promes of his godly assistance,
which they fand not in the

beginning of their interpryses, and
therefore they did considder the
fearcenes of his displeasure, & did
tremble before his angrie Face,
whose myghtie hand they fand to
fight against them, and that wes
the cause of their dolorous complaintes
and fearfull crying before
their God. What wes the cause
that God delt so framedly with
the one, and with the vther? we
may perchance somewhat speak,
when that we shall entreat of the
frutes of Fasting, and of those thinges
that may holde back from vs
the assistance of God, euen when
we prepare vs to put his commandement
in execution. The thride
cause of publict Fasting, is Godes
threatninges pronounced, ether
against a multitude, or against a
persone in particulare. Of the former
the exemple is Niuiue, vnto
the which Ionas cryed, yet fourtie
dayes, & Niniue shalbe distroyed,
which vnpleasing tydinges cū
               ming

to the eares of the King, he
proclamed a Faste, he humbled his
owen soule, yea, euē to Sackcloth,
and sitting in the duste, he straitlie
commanded reformatiō of maners
in all estates, yea, and that signes of
repentance, of terrours, and feare
shuld appeare, not onely in men &
wemen, but also in the brute beastes,what shall become of the hardnes of our hear
                  
                     •••
                   in those dayes.
from whome wes all kynde
of nurishement commanded to be
withdrowen, to witnes that they
feared aswell Godes iudgementes
to fall vpone the creatures that serued
them in their impietie, as vpōe
them selues that had prouoked
God to that hote displeasure. Of
the vther the exemple is moste notable
(moste notable we say) because
that it fell in a wicked man,
to wit, in Achab, who by instigation
of his wicked wyfe lesebell,
saulde him self to do all iniquitie.
And yet when that he hard the
fearefull threatninges of God pronounced
by the Prophet Elias against
him,
                  
                     •
                  . R

                  •
                and

hous, he rent his royall garmentes,
put on Sackcloth, sleipt therein,
fasted and yead baire footed, what
ensewed the one and the vther, of
these we shall after heare.
            The fourt cause of publict Fasting
and murning (for they two
muste euer be ioyned) is iniquitio
deprehended, that before wes not
ryghtly considdered. The testimony
whereof we haue in Esdras,
after the reduction of the captiuitie,
& that the temple & the work
of the Lordes hous wes stayed. It
wes shawen vnto Esdras that the
people of Israell,1. Esdr. 
                     •
                  . the Preistes and
the Leuites were not seperat from
the people of the Nation
                  •
               , but
that they did according to their
abhominations, for they maryed
vnto them selues, and vnto their
Sonnes, the doughters of the Cananites,
the Pherisites, Hithetes, Iebusites,
Ammorites, Moabites, and
Egiptiens, so that the holy sead wes
mixt with Prophane Idolateris,

which thing being vnderstand, &
more deaply considdered, then it
wes before, for then Esdras sawe
iust cause why the worke of the
Lord prospered not in their hādes.
This considdered, we say Esdras
taking vpone him the sinne and
offence of the whole people, rent
his clothes, and pulled furth the
heares of his head and beard, sat as
a man desolate of all conforte, till
the euening Sacrifice, and then rysing
he bowed his kneis, and streached
furth his hande, before the
Lord, and made a moste semple &
humble confession of all the enormities
that were committed be the
people, as well before the captiuitie
as after their returning, and ceased
not his lamentable cōplaint, vnto
suche tyme as a great multitude o

and promised redres of that
present disordour and impietie.
            Of the last cause of publict Fasting▪
               
to wit, the zeale that certane
persones beare for preseruation of
Godes people, for adu
                  ••

that are in Susan,Esdr. 4. and faste for me,

and thre nyghtes, and I also, and
my hādmades shall likewyse faste,
& then shall I enter vnto the King,
although that I shuld perishe.
            In this we may clearely se that
the zeale that Mardocheus had to
preserue the people of God, moued
not onely him self to publict
Fasting, but also Ester the Quene,
her maides and the whole Iewes
that hard of the murther intēded,
and moued Ester also to hasart her
lyfe in going vnto the King without
his commandement.
            Of the uther, to wit, that the
earnest desyre that Godes seruandes
haue that God will performe
his promes, & manteane the worke
that he hath begune. Exemple we
haue in Daniell,
                  
                     〈…〉

Fasted and prayed, & whill
that they wer so exercised, charge
wes giuen, that Paule and Barnabas
shuld be seperated frome the
rest, to the worke whereunto God
had called them. &c. Of these
former Histories and Scriptures,
we may clearly se for what causes
publict Fasting, and generall supplicationes
haue bene made in the
Church of God, and ought to be
made when that euer the lyke necessities
appeare, or occasions are
offered. Now let vs shortly heare
what conforte and frute ensewed
the same. For the ennimie, yea,
the murtherer of all godly exercise
is disperation, for with what corage
can any man with continuāce
call vpone God? If he shall disperatly
dout: whether God shall
accept his prayer or not? How

shall he humble him self before his
Throne? Or to what end shall he
confesse his offence? If he be not
perswaded, that there is mercy and
good will in God to pardone his
sinnes, to accept him in fauour, &
to grant vnto him more then his
owen heart, in the middest of his
dolour can requyre or ymagine.
            Trew it is, that this vennome of
disperation, is neuer throughlie
purged from our heartes, so long
as we cary this mortall Carcasse.
            But yet the constant promises of
our God, and the many folde docu
mentes of his mercy & help, show
en vnto men in their greatest extremitie,
ought to animat vs to sollow
their exemple, and to hope for
the same successe that they haue
gotten abufe mannes expectation.

that he saw the people willing to
obey God, and the worke of the

            The bitter crying of Mardocheus,
and the painefull Fasting of Ester
were aboundantly rewarded, whē
not onely wes the people of God
preserued, but Haman their mortall
ennimie, wes hanged vpon the
same gallous that he had prepared

For Mardocheus.
            Daniell after his Fasting, confession
and prayer, gat moste notable
reuelationes & assurance, that
his people shuld be deliuered, yea,
that in all extremities, they shuld
be preserued, till that the Messias
promysed vnto them shuld come,
and manifestly showe him self.
            And the godly of Anteochea wer
not frustrate of their conforte, whē
that they hard how potently God
had wrought amōgest the Gentiles
by the ministerie, of Barnabas &
Paule, so that we may boldely cō
               clude,
that as God hath neuer dispysed
the petitions of such as with
vnfeaned heartes haue soght his cō
               fort
in their necessities, so will he
not sēd vs away emptie & voyd, if
with trew repētāce we seak his face
            If any wolde aske in what extremitie
we finde our selues now
to be, that hertosore we haue not
sene. And what are the occasiones
that shuld moue vs now to

humble our selues before our Go
by publict Fasting, more then tha
we did in the beginning? When
this Euangile wes now last offered
vnto vs, for then by all apperance,
we and it in our persones stoode in
greater danger, then we do yet,.
            We answer, that the causes are mo
then for greif of haert we can expresse.
First, because that in the
beginning we had not refused godes
graces, but contrariwyse with
such feruencie we receaued them,Causes that now moue vs to faste that moued vs not befor
that we could beare with no kinde
of impietie: but for the suppressing
of the same, we nether had respect
to frende, possession, land or lyfe,
but all we put in hasard, that gode;
treuth myght be aduansed, and Idolatrie
myght be suppressed.
            And therefore did our God by the
mouth of his Messingers, in all our
aduersities, assure vs that our ennimies
shuld not preuale against vs,Let the fath full call to mynde.
but that they shuld be subdewed
vnder vs, that our God shuld be

glorified in our semple & vpryght
dealing. But now sence that carnall
wisdome hath perswaded vs
to beare with manifest Idolatrie, &
to suffer this realme that God had
ones purged, to be polluted againe
with that abhominatiō, yea, allace,
sence yt some of vs that God made
sōe tymes instrumētes to suppresse
that impietie, haue bene the cheif
mē to cōduct & conuoy that Idole
throughout all the quarters of this
Realme, yea, to the houses of them
that sometymes detested the masse
as the Deuill & his seruice. Sence
that tyme we say, haue we funde
the face of our God, angrie against
vs, his threatninges haue bene sharpe
in the mouthes of his Messingers,
which albeit for the tyme, we
dispysed & mocked, yet the iust experience
conuicteth vs, that we
were wicked, & that they in threatning
vs,God grant that mē may yet consider did nothing but the dewtie
of Godes trew Messingers.
            And this is the second cause that

moue vs to this publict humiliatiō,
rather now then in the beginning,
to wit, that then we followed god,
and not carnall wisdome, & therefore
made he few in nomber, feare
full to many, fooles before the
worlde to confound the wyse, and
suche as before neuer had experience
in armes, made God so bolde
and so prosperous in all their interpryses,
that the expertest Souldioures
feared the poore plowmen,
yea, our God faught for vs by sea,
and by land, he moued the heartes
of strangers to supporte vs, and to
spend their liues for our releif.
            But now allace we se no signe of
his former fauour, for wisdome &
māhead, strength and freindes, honour
and blood ioyned with godlynes,
are fallen before our eyes,
to let vs vnderstand what shall be
our distruction, if in time we turne
not to our God, before that his
wrathe be further kindled. But
this is not the end. For esperance,

(or at least some opinion) had men
before, that God shulde moue th
                  •
               
Quenis Maiesties heart, to heare y•
blissed euangle of Iesus Christ trewlie
preached, and so cōsequentlie
that she shuld abandone all Idolatrie
and fals Religion. But now she
hath giuen answer in plaine wordes,
that that Religion in whiche
she hath bene nourished (and that
is meare abhomination) she will
manteane and defend. And in declaration
thereof, of laite dayes
there is erected a displayed baner
against Iesus Christ, for corrupted
Hypocrites, & suche as haue bene
knowen deceauers of the people,
are now authorised, to spew out
their vennome against Iesus Christ
his eternall trueth, and trew Messingers
of the same. That Idole th
                  •
               
Masse is now againe in diuers places
erected. And what hereof
may ensew, yea, or what we may
looke, shalbe the end of suche vnhappy
beginninges, we desyre the

godly deaply to considder. But
let it be granted, that we had not
fallen back from our former feruē
               cie,
that we saw not Godes angrie
face, threatning vs with more fear
full plagues to follow, that the best
parte of our nobilitie wer not exiled
this Realme, nether yet that
our Souerane were ennimie to our
Religion, and that she bare no
greater fauour to flattering freres,
and to corrupted Papistes, thē that
she doeth to our poore Preachers.
            Supponing we say that none of
these foresaid causes we had to
moue vs (as that we haue them all,
and mo, if that we list to recompt
them) yet is there one which if it
moue vs not to humiliation, we
showe our selues more then insensible.
For now is Sathan so enraged

And albeit that God of his mercie

interpryses, yet let vs not thinke
that their will is changed, or their

malice asswaged. No let vs be assured
that they abyde but oportunitie

For the trafique of that dragone,
now with the princes of the

entysementes tend to none vther
end, but to inflambe them against
Iesus Christ, and against the trew
professoures of his Euangle. For
who can think that the Pope, Cardinalles,

the Romaine Churche, till suche

to a good & happy end. If these
be not open declarationes, in what
danger all faithfull stand, if they
can bring their crueltie to passe, let
verray Idiotes iudge, but let vs
heare their conclusion. France
and Germanie (say they) being by
these meanes so chastised, abased &

conducted to the obedience of the
holy Romaine Churche, the Fathers
dout not, but tyme shall prouide

and one Apostolick gouernour &
Pastour. &c. By this conclusion
we thinke that the verray blinde
may see what is purposed against
the Saintes of God, in all Realmes
and Nationes, to wit, distruction
with crueltie, or els to make them
to worship that blasphemous beast
who being an Idole, vsurpeth to
him selfe the Name of vniuersall
Pastoure, and being knowen to be
the man of sinne and perdition,
will be holden for an Apostolick
Gouernour. But some shall say
they are yet fare from the end of
their purpose, and therefore we
neid not to be so fearefull, nor so
sollist. We answer, the danger may
be nerar, then we beleaue, yea,
perchance a parte of it hath bene

neirar to our neckes then we haue
considdered. But how so euer it
be, seing that God of his mercie
hath brought furth to lyght their
cruell and bloody counsall, in the
which we nead not to dout, but
still they continew. It becōmeth
vs not to be negligent nor sleuthfull,
but we ought to follow the
exemple of Ezechias, the King of
Iuda, who receauing not onely the

that Babiloniane hoore hath power

Abuse all these causes foresaid,
we haue yet one that ought
not to be omitted, to wit, the body

what trouble is presently, and long

that our Rebellion to God is les,
then is the Rebellion of those nations

we say that onely repentance can

Wherefore shall we Faste? and
who hath power to command vs
so to do? A Feg for their Fasting,

            Ieremie the Prophet preached and
cryed euen to the King,Ierem. 13. and to the

that they shoulde sit still vpone

               ullie, and what
promes he maketh to such as obey
him. This people externallie professed
God, they daylie sought his
face, by reparing to the Temple,
hearing of the Law, and exercising
of the Sacrifices, yet did God plague
them in mo sortes then one, as
in the bookis of the Kinges & Cornickles
we may read. In their extremitie
they ran (as to them appeared)
to the vttermoste ref
                  •
               ge, they
Fasted, and vnfeanedly humbled
their bodies, for that the Prophet
meaneth, when that he sayeth,
that they Fasted till that their neckes
were weakned and made faint
as a bull rashe, for verray lack of
corporall 
                  •
               oode. They layed of
their gorgious garmentes, and put
on S
                  •
               ckcloth. &c. And yet wer

their troubles nothing releued.
            And that wes the cause why they
querrelled with God, and said.
            Why haue we Fasted, and tho
                  •
               
hast not sene? &c. And in verray
dead to the natural man it wes
strange, for god had promised that
he wolde conforte his people, whē
               soeuer
they shuld humble them
selues before him,Deut. 3. 1. Reg. 8. notwithstāding
their former iniquitie.
            In the externall ceremonies, nor
in the corporall exercises, there
could no fault be espyed. Why
then doeth not God heare them?
complaine they. God answereth
that their outwarde profession wes
but Hipocrisie, their Fasting wes
but mocking of God, and their
prayers could do nothing but prouoke
him to further displeasure.
Because that albeit they reteaned
the Name of God, and albeit that
they appeared in his Temple, yet
had they forsaken bothe his iudgementes,
statutes, and holie ordinā
               ces.

Albeit the bodie stouped, &
wes afflicted by Fasting, yet remaned
the heart proude and rebellious
against God,Let euerie man examin his owen cō
                  science. for they followed
their owen corrupted wayes,
they oppressed suche as were subiect
vnto them, their heauie Yo

               k
lay vpone the neckes of suche as
could not ridde them selues from
their bondage. Amonges them
were stryfe, debaite, whisperinges
of malice, yea, open contention,
and manifest violence, which all
were euident declaratiōs of proud
heartes, and impenitent Soulles.
            And therefore God giueth vnto
them open defyance, in the tyme
whē they think that they seak his
peace moste earnestly. And here
to ought we this day that professe
the Lord Iesus, & haue renounced
abhominations of Papistrie within
the Realme of Scotland, giue
deligent head. For it is not the
semple knoweledge of the trueth
onelie, nor yet the externall profession

of the same, that is acceptable
before God. Nay nay deare
brethrene,1 salm. 34. he requireth the frutes
of repentance, and they are▪ to declyne

publict Assemblies in preuie meditation
with their God.

the one Sonday in the morning,
till the nixt Sonday at nyght.
            Albeit that the straitnes of abstistence
is to be kept, but the two
dayes onely.

be dispysers of so necessarie an exercyse.
            The tyme that shalbe spent, aswell
before none as after, must be
left to the wisdome of the discrete
Ministers, who best cā iudge bothe
what the auditore may beare, and
what them selues are able to sustene.
But because that this exercise
is extraordinary, the tyme thereof
wolde be somewhat longer then it
vsed to be in the accustomed Assemblies.
And yet we wolde not
haue it so tedious,what houres before none & what after none. that it shulde be
noysome to the people. And therfore
we think that thre houres &
les, before noune, and two houres
at after noune, shalbe sufficient for
the whole exercyse publict. The
rest to be spent in preuie meditation,
euerie familie aparte.
            The Sonday preceading the last
Sonday of February as before is
said, shall euerie minister giue aduertisement
to his flocke, of such

               ame Realme, desyre grace and
peace from God the Father of our
Lord Iesus Christ, with the perpetuall

               THE present miserie,
and greater troubles
appearing shortly to
follow, craue (deare
brethrene) that euerie
one of vs exhorte and admonishe
another, that we recule not
back in the beginning of this battel,
which is cum vpon vs, vnlooked
for of many. And therefore it

is that we your brethrene, partakers
with yow of the afflictions of
Iesus Christ, vnderstanding the extremitie,
wherein the whole Ministers
within this Realme now stād,
for lake of reasonable prouision, to

            Haue thought expedient to communicate
with yow our myndes
by this our letter. Which is, that
firste we shall deligently marke
those wordes of the Apostle saying,

fearefull sentence of our Master
Iesus Christ saying. No man putting

our selues warriours against

of his mercy hathe opened oure

this wicked worlde, and to
contend to enter into that heauenly

Ierusalē. God hath honored vs
so, that men hath iudged vs the
Messingers of the euerlasting, by
vs hath he disclosed Idolatrie, by
vs are the wicked of the worlde
rebuked, and by vs hath our God
cōforted the consciences of many
that were oppressed with ignorāce
and impietie. Considder then
deare brethrene what sclander &
offence shall we giue to the weak?
What occasion of reioysing shall
the ennimies haue? And to what
ignominie shall we expone the glorious
Euangle of Iesus Christ? If
that we for any occasion shall desist
and cease from publict preaching
of the same.
            We that admonishe yow are
not ignorant, nether yet altogether
without experience, how vehement
a dart pouertie is, & what
troublesome cogitations it is able
to rase, yea, euen in men of greatest

               ALbeit that nether suche as did

those that haue trauelled to set

haue impyre aboue the bodies

wryte: yet haue they no dout power
from God to rebuke sinne, &
to craue repentance, especially of
suche as God hath called to his
knowledge, in the middest of this
moste obstinate and corrupt generation.
