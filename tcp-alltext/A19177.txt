Vharof thair be ſo many popular

let tham be vnto the as Etniques and

or à particular numbre ſeparating
thair ſelf from the hoill body
and preſuming to apply theis
paſſages agans the ſaid vniuerſall
body (as I my ſelf once did agans
the Catholiques Romane) is to be
eſtemit ſo doing as iniurius and
impertinent as vas Achab imputing

So the ſaid paſſages be moſt foolishly

               THE difficulty to print
any thing in our vulgar
toung on this ſyid

VV, vhilk be ſo commun to vs ſall (I
truſt good redar) excuſe the manifold
faltes and incorrectnes of the orthography.
            Bot concerning my oune faltes heir
in to much manifeſted (yit not cōſiſting

in the doctrin yat I defend nor in the
matter of this treatiſe bot in my homly
and inexact treating tharof) I can thar
in pretend no ſufficient excuſe bot by ſinceir
confeſſion of my inſufficiency to beſech
the reſpect my good affection not
my gros imperfection and to cenſur the
ſingilnes of my mynd as gratiuſly as the
myit of the Euangelique vedou vas cenſurit
by our lord and maſter, vouchafing
at leſt to reid me patiently befor thou
reprehend and to ponder me veill befor
you pronunce thy ſentence. Laſt if the
multitud of allegations brocht in for cō
               firmatiō
of matters diſputed vithin this
treaſis, ſall ſeam prolixt and tedius: ſuirly
in yat alſo I muſt confes à falt, yit
ſuch à falt as I haue villingly cōmitted
for auoyding à greter. For the treuth is
yat the commendation in many partes
of ſcriptur geuin vnto glaid and plentifull
geuers and the exemple of god almychty

in Raning doun his quailles and
manna ſo abundantly vpon his famiſſit
pepill, and the Euangelique hiſtorie declaring
hou cryſt our maſter vold not
feid the multitud euin in à deſert vildirnes
bot vith ſuch largnes as thair reſtit
aluay certane baſquetts of ſuperplus:
theis laudabill exēples I ſay maid
me purpoſly to charg the bord vyth ſo
many diſches perſauing the greatnes of
the ſpirituall famin afflicting my veilbelouit
brethring, the rather for that
the aduerſars dayly deaf tham vyth
endles deteſtation of our doctrin alleging
yat ve haue no ſtoir of ſound arguments
to confirm the ſame. For this cauſs I
thocht it culd offend no treu Chriſtian
if I ſuld out of the magaſin or ſtorhous
of antiquitie, experience and reſon produce
ſum plētifull quantitie for conforting
the indigent and confounding the
arrogant. Bot to conclud if you canſt

not allou of this cōſideration I vill anſsr
vnto the vith Allexander king of Macedons
vho vrit once in this ſort vnto
his Mingnon Leonidas yat fand falt
vyth him for ſpending to much frank

the church of Rome and hir adherentes and
not to any vther church impugning hir.
            And as to ſuch as vold haue ſound doctrin
and ſincer miniſtration of the Sacramentes to
be infallibill marques of the treu church,Soūd doctrin and ſincer miniſtration of the ſacramēts be not inſallibill marques of the treu church. ſuch
men be pitifully abuſit: for theis be not the propre
marques of the church quarto modo as ſay
the Logicians ſeing all Heretiques yat haue bene
heirtofor haue chalengit as much or more
that prerogatiue as did the vndouted orthodox

bitterly contend one agans one vther to haue

vee muſt fynd ſum vther markes more certane
and ſpeciall to th' end vee may euidently ſee
vhilk church this day contending vpon this
point ſuld be preferrit vnto the reſt. Vhence
then ſall vee extract the ſaid infallibill marques?
not of the brane of any party contending: for
lyik as to the making of of à perfyit circle vee
muſt haue à firm and immouable centre: ſo to

                  •
               ind out theis marques deuly as aperteyneth to
th'end no party contending haue iuſt cauſe of
exception thai muſt be deriuit from ſuch equall

and clear fundaments as all contendantes ſall
agree vnto. For this cauſe vee ſall extract thame
partly out of the Symbol vhilk generally
all Chriſtians this day vſe collected (as Sanct
Auguſtin doth affirm) by the Apoſtles thameſelf:Four infallible marques of the treu church.
Partly of theis Symboles vhilk ves gatherit
by ancients in the moſt famus counſalles of
Nice and Cōſtantinople more nor à 1300. years
ago. In the Symbol of the Apoſtles the church
is callit holy and Catholique, in th' other tuo
ſche is callit one and Apoſtolique. Vharupon I
do gather four marques ſo proper and peculiar
to the treu church yat churches Hereticall can
not vithout manifeſt impudence arrogat the ſame
as thai do the vther tuo of ſound doctrin
and ſincer miniſtration of the ſacramentes.
            Then the firſt mark is to be holy:The firſt mark of the treu church is holines. vhilk is not
to be vnderſtud yat all being vithin the church
be holy and iuſt: becaus yat the church vhilk in
the Grec is callit Eccleſia hes hir name from
vocation or calling vharby it is certane yat

            Item it is à verey poor argument to ſay the

for experience techit the contrar often tymes

Dogma datur Chriſtianis, quod in'carnem trāſit panis

Sub diuerſis ſpeciebus, ſignis tantum & non rebus, latent

Fracto demum Sacramento, ne vacilles ſed memento

            As to yat vhilk is allegit out of the firſt Corinth.
11. chap. Vhar the body of our lord is callit
bread: Vharupon if thai vill infer yat thair can
be no thing thair bot bread my I not as veill
infer yat thair can be no thing thair bot the body
of our lord ſeing our lord him ſelf did call
the bread his body. This mycht be ane ſufficiēt
anſuer to ane argument ſo inſufficient bot yit I
vill be more ſpeciall in declaring vharfor the body
of our lord is callit bread by th' Apoſtle. Firſt
becaus Cryſt him ſelf and his bleſſed body is in
many places of ſcriptur ſo namit: as in Ieremie
11. vhar it is ſaid let vs put the tree to his bread: Vhar
by the tree the cros and by the bread Cryſt or

his bleſſed body vas praefigurat according to the
opinion of all th' ancients: and in the Euangell
Cryſt is callit the bread vhilk deſcēdit frō heauin.
Bot in the tabill of out lord I remember not to
haue red the body of Cryſt to haue bene callit
abſolutly bread bot euer vith ſum adiction, ether
demōſtratiue, relatyue, or explicatiue: as in
the paſſage of Sanct Paul forſaid vhen it is ſaid:
Vho eated of this bread, and agane, the bread
vhilk vee brek, and in the. 6. of Iohne. the bread
vhilk I ſall giue you is my fleſch. and as all the
ancients doth affirm the holy ſpreit vſit to Ioyn
theis adiections yat vee may vnderſtand tharby
yat he ſpekit not of commun bread bot of ſum
miſticall bread or myſterie comprehēdit vnder
the form of bread. Secondly the Apoſtle calling
the body bread he ſo ſpekit becaus the liniaments
and form of bread and not of the body
be ſene, euin as he callit the blood nether blood
nor vyne bot à coop becaus the contening coop
is more patent to our Eyis nor the contents tharof:
thridly in the ſcriptur oft tymes things be
namit after thair exterior form: So the braſin
ſerpent vas callit à ſerpent ſo the Angelles var
callit men appering in the form of man. Laſt
of all it is à cōmun cuſtum in ſcriptur to retene
or keap the ould name in things changit from
one form or natur to ane vther:Numer. 21. Geneſ. 18. and 19. ſo vyne is callit
in the Euangill à graip or berry, ſo the deuill is
yit callit Lucifer, ſo man is callit clay, ſo the rod
of Moyſes ves callit à rod vhen it vas no rod
bot à ſerpent: and this I fynd alſo confirmit by

ane vther auld hym aſcryuit to Sanct Ambroſe
vhar it is ſaid. Paulum profers tu docētem, panis nomen
imponentem, corpori dominico: Moyſen ego referentem
virgae nomen in ſerpentem, pari modo replico.
Mos eſt frequens Scripturarum, rerum vt praeteritarum
voces dent praeſentihus: Homo humus nominatur, vinum
vna appellatur, daemon Lucifer vocatur, ſat haec
ſanis mentibus.
            
            Laſt vheras in the place for ſaid th'Apoſtle
doth pronunce ſuch as eat and drink vnvorthely
to be gilty not of bread or vyne bot of the
body and blood of Cryiſt Ieſus, thatby he doth
manifeſtly point out vnto vs no commun bread
bot the body of Cryſt to be eatin in this bleſſed
Sacrament.
            Then to conclud this ſection if you shall ſay
vith the Capharnaits, this is ane hard ſpeeh, I
vill anſuet vyth Cryſt yat fleſch heirin profetit
no thing yat is to ſay yat carnall raiſon can no
more comprehend this nor ſche can cōprehend
à creation of all things of no thing, à conception
and generation vythout carnall copulatiō preceding,
à corporall aſcenſion vithout violence,
or à reſurrection of body and bones conuerted
in duſt and aſches. if you ſall ſay vith Sanct Thomas
yat you canſt not beleif except you ſee, I
ſall yit anſuer vyth our bleſſed ſauior yat thai be
bleſſed yat beleif and haue not ſene. and if you
ſalt (as did the Virgin Marie) aſtoniet exclame
ſaying hou can this be ſeing I knou not à man?
as if you ſuld ſay yat you canſt ſee no naturall
appearance or likliehoid yat the bread ſuld be

conuerted in ane reall body: I anſuer vith the
Angell yat it behouit the holy ſpreit to ſurpriſe
or poſſes the and the pouer of the moſt high to
ouerſchaddou the, otheruayis you ſall no les
dout of thy creation, ſaluation and reſurrection
nor of the reall preſence. Morouer you ſuld not
misknou yat fayth hes no praiſs or merit vhar
humane raiſon may proue the ſame, ād yat modeſt
Chriſtians in matters of fayth ſuld content
thair ſelf yat thai be ſuch vndemanding vhy or
hou thai be ſuch lyk as S. Paul being rauiſſit vnto
the heauins kneu he ſau Cryiſt bot vhidder he
did ſee him corporally or not corporally he nether
kneu nor inquirit.
            Bot returning to the matre I hoip I haue by
argumēts preceding clearly ſcheuit the doctrin
of Catholiques in cheif heads of Religion controuerted
to be inſallibilly confirmit, by expres

doth affirm the church to be vhar Pope Cornelius

not for the church Romane, and yat Rome

faythfull ſucceſſors, bot Nero, Domitiꝰ, Diocleſian:
Yat is to ſay not Rome ſuffring patiēt, Apoſtolique:
bot Rome perſequutor, infidell Antiapoſtolique.
            In this ſort Tertulliā in the forſaid place doth
expone him ſelf ſaying: Babylon is à figure of
the citie of Rome not of the church Romane.
I do notuythſtanding confes the citie of Rome
to haue ſurpaſſed boyth Babylon of Egypt and
Chaldae a for pryid and perſequution of the ſeruants
of God: for as the Chaldaean and Aegyptiā
kings did afflict the Hebreu church, ſo did the
Romane emprors much more perſequut the
poor Chriſtian church: For by thair meanes
boyth Cryſt him ſelf and Peter and Paul the
principalls of the Apoſtles vith many Romane
biſchops and ane infinit multitud of vther conſtant

Chriſtians var martyred partly at Rome
partly at Ieruſalē partly at vther places ſubiect
to thair dominions. and for this cauſe Sanct
Hierom after he had callit Rome à Babylō and
purpurd hoor &c. For the multitud of ſins vhilk
regnit in hit (as vſually thai do in all gret citeis)
he addit notuythſtanding theis vords,Hierom epiſtle to Marcellin chap., ann in his 2. book agans Iouinian. ſaying
thair is in hir ane holy church, à treu profeſſion
of Cryſt and the trophees or enſeinges of many
bleſſed Martyrs and morouer by this confeſſiō
of Cryſt (ſayis he) the blaſphemy or myſterie vrittin
in the forhead of that citie, is effaced and
veapt auay. For theis be his vords in yat ſame
place ſpeking to Rome. Vnto the I vill ſpek o
potent citie commendit by the voyce of th' Apoſtle
vhilk by confeſſion of Cryſt hes veapt
auay the blaſphemy vrittin in thy forhead.
            Rome then in reſpect of hir Ethnique Empyir
and perſecurion of Cryſtians mycht veill
haue bene callit Babylon bot in reſpect of the
Chriſtian church yat euer hes bene in hir ſen
the dayis of th' Apoſtles ſche nether vas callit
nor vas Babylon. Morouer (if vee ſall ether giue
credit to hiſtoreis or Doctors of the prim iue
church) it is certane yat vhen Nero tyranniſed
in Rome Sanct Peter dogmatiſet thair vnto
yat church vhilk in the laſt chap. of the firſt epiſtle
of S. Peter is callit th' elect church vhilk is
in Babilō ād yat after S. Peter thair var many holy
Romane biſchops martyriſed thair by infidell
c̄prors boyth th' one ād vther remaning at one
tyme vithin the ſaid citie. Yea after the emprors

tharof becam Chriſtians ſche did ceaſs any more
in any reſpect to be Babilonique, and vas callit
Apoſtolique if vee may truſt antiquitie.
            Vharfor vhenas Sanct Auguſtin and Oroſius
doth compare hir vnto Babylon all yat is in reſpect
of ethnique infidell emprors not in reſpect
of the Chriſtian, faytfull paſtors and trou
church. and this phraſe of ſpech as it had bene
of auld ſo is it in this age vſit. For as the propheſeis

            Bot all this can not content the contentius
vho ſtill inſiſt ſaying yat albeit the Romane

intollerabill. Vharunto I anſuer vith interrogation
demanding if the ſcripturs haue bene

or the Sacraments deuly adminiſtrat at any tyme

forſaid Yea at yat ſame tyme vhen the Chriſtian
fayth vas firſt planted in Scotland (vhilk
vas about à 1400. year ago) is vſit preſently and
obſeruit in the Romane church. For probation
tharof nedit no more bot to reid the confeſſiōs
Auguſtinian prented in places vnſuſpect and
fathfully collected out of S. Auguſtin vho ſlotiſſit
about à 1200. years ago: vith the Hierarchy

            For all this, the inſatiabill vill not yit be ſatifeit
ſtill replying yat the names of tranſſubſtantiatiō,

Yat no more ver the ſacred names of trinitie ād

yat neu errors producing neu erronius vords to

thair Apoſtolique function.
            Bot to adher vnto our purpos tuiching Paſtors
I vill vpon this ſubiect for auoyding prolixitie
only alleg one exemple vrittin in ancient Annales
of vigilius 61. Pope in number. This Vigilius
interit to his Pontificat by vnlaufull meanis, for
by inſtigation of Auguſta the Empriſſe he procurit
the baniſment and eiection of, S. Siluerius
(afteruart marteriſed for the Chriſtiā fayth) the
ſaid Auguſta being highly offendit vith the ſaid
Silucrius becaus he vold not reſtore hir freind
Authemius to his Epiſcopat of Conſtantinopill
from vhilk he vas Iuſtly eiected (as one mēteyning
the Hereſie of Eutyches) by Agapetus predeceſſor
vnto the ſaid holy Siluerius. Nou Vigilius
to obtene the Pontificat did promiſs vnto
the ſaid Auguſta to reeſtabliſs hir ſaid freind
and by this meanis he is maid Pope and holy
Siluerius caſt out. Bot the ſaid Vigilius vas not ſo
ſone inſtallit and ſet doun in the chair of Sanct
Peter vhen thair chanſit vnto him ane accident
boyth admirable and laudable. For as king Saul
going out fulfillit vith the ſpreit of malice and
of deliberat mynd to haue killit Dauid vas not

uithſtanding ſurpriſed by the ſpreit of manſuetud
far by his expectation: ſo Pope Vigilius Intring
in to his ſuprem dignitie of ſet purpos to
haue fulfillit his vnlaufull promis vas poſſeſſit
vith the holy ſpreit by verteu vharof (as Sanct
Paul going to be à perſequutar vas turnit in à
Paſtor) he chuſit rather all reproch, ignominy
and punition nor to bloit the Pontificall place
of his glorius anteceſſors by fulfilling à filthy
iniquitie promiſit allanerlie vpon auarice and
ambition. So after he had moſt Chriſtianly and
conſtantly indurit impriſomment famin and
many vther torments by means of the ſaid Auguſta
he did vith gret patience confes yat moſt
iuſtly he had merit ſuch torments and more for
his iniuſt dealing agaus holy Siluerius. So this
Vigilius at his firſt entree vas not vnlyik Cayphas:

               mpaneing
the place and function vhilk he did

promis.
            Bot in anſsring this vay to eury particular
matter yat the curiꝰ and captiꝰ tak exception agās
or to refut point by point eury head cōtenit
in the negatyue cōfeſſiō of fayth vſit vith in ſcot

the fayth and form yat vas vſit in the church euer

viſs yat any man ſuld ſo deall vyth tham for if ve
ſall go and diſput vpon all ceremoneis from the
holy vatter vnto the hie altar ve ſall bot vr̄agill

one vith ane vther vithout edification, that for
to knou if all rites and cuſtoms vithin the Romane
church be laufull or not me think no belter
mean is nor euer to reduce the aduerſars to
yat point yat thay may be cōtent to try if ſche be
the laufull and treu church or not, for in trying
only yat one point (vhilk may be done vith as litill
or les pane not to try the meaneſt of all the
reſt) as on th' one part tharby you may in gros
iuſtly declyn and deteſt all hir ceremonies trying
hir not to be the treu church: ſo on th' other
part being found to be the treu church (as vndoutedly
ſche is) then you muſt be eſtemit too to
arrogant and impudent diſpyſing hir ordonnā
               ces
houſoeuer thai ſeam contrarius to your priuat

as ſuch à one ſuld be iuſtlie eſtemit ſeditius ſo he

Prince hauing à laufull pouer vith incomparabill
prudēce ſuld not be put in queſtiō reducing

impung the Princes authoritie. For in particular

particular reſons mouing the Prince in his taxations,
donations, reuocations, forfaltors, reſtitutions,
pardons and punitions, &c. var à matter
boyth endles and ſuch as none bot the Prince
him ſelf culd veill render reſon for: ſeing the
harts of Princes be only detected and directed

vnto and by God. Agane I fynd à lord in poſſeſſion
of à fair ſeigneurie, I inter vithin the ſame,
I mark all his palices and plantations, his tryne
and tenents. I fynd ſum of his houſes to my cō
               ſait
ſo ill ſituat ſo ill proportionat, his familie ād

hand and reform, and not only reform bot poſſes
my ſelf vithin the ſaid lordſchip becaus I cā
reuil it better nor the heritor tharof hauing no

fynd tham no more formall nor better foundit
and tharfor thai muſt aluay be forcit to cum to
the fundamentall queſtion to try if the church
Catholique Romane be the treu church vhilk
being tryit to be ſuch (as no dout it is) then hir
ordōnances ſuld be vithout cōtradiction obeyit
and the repreheuſions, reformations, poſſeſſiōs

deformations and violent vſurpatiōs,
and finially all incorrigibilly refuſing to hear hir
voyce ſuld be according to yat in the 18. of Sanct
Math. reputed for Ethniques and Publicans.
            Then to conclud this ſection ſupponing yat
all var treu vhilk thai obiect agans the Romane
church vhat remeid I pray you var moſt conuenient
and Chriſtian to reduce all theis turbulēt
tempeſts afflicting the church vnto à quietnes
according to the vniform ancient eſtat yat ſche

vas once into, to the glory of God ād vniuerſall

much meditat vpon this matter vith ſuch indifferēcy
as my meannes culd aford I culd find no
middis more agreable or aequall to all parteis

of Petil. Saying: Vhat hes the chair of the Romane
church done vnto the in vhilk chair Peter once did
ſitt and nou ſittit Anaſtaſius? and immediatly tharefter.
Vhy callis you the Apoſtolicall chair the chair

            O my dearly belouit if you vold deuly conſidder

your ſelf from à ſocietie ſo much extollit by
the Apoſtle ād all venerable ātiquitie: yea ſuch à
ſocietie as euidētlye is markit vith all the ſignes
of the treu church. In doing vharof do you not
perſaue hou you condem as infidells and teprobats

all yat hes precedit you, ſib and fremd,
freind and fo, lernit and vnlernit, holy and prophane
Good and bad: For if your fayth and profeſſion
be Good and the only vay to ſaluation:
then all yat befor your age be dead muſt be in
danger of damnation becaus thai deit in à contrary

            Agane if I ſuld let it pas yat you had iuſt caus
to abandon the Romane church, yit vold I

Antilutherans, thai all pretend equall
aſſurance of the holy ſpreit and produce varrands
out of the vord of God eury one of tham
conteſting yat ſche is the treu church. Heirunto
if thou ſall ſay yat thou lyikit beſt ſum one or

Rotmannus father of th' Anabaptiſts vhilk be

vorld bot ſo much as thai haue bene ſene ſen
the year of our lord 1517. if I ſay thou vill alleg
and affirm yat thou hes choſin ſum one or vther
of theis ſectes as yat vhilk in thy opinion or iugment

ſeamit vnto the moſt agreable and conſonant
vnto the veritie: then mark I pray the
thy dangerus preſumption in eſtabliſſing thy
priu at opinion to be the reull of thy fayth, vſurping
vnto thy ſelf vhilk you vill not giue nether

thy opinion thay may all err and as if you culdſt
not erre at all and this follouing thy priuat fantaſy
vithout reſipiſcence, you fallis in the damnabill
error of ancient heretiques.
            Bot if I ſuld grant vnto the yat it is leſum to
follou in matters of fayth ſuch as ſe amit to the
moſt conſonant vnto the veritie: yit let me once
demand if you canſt produce vnto me any
one man of all ages preceding yat in all points

vhilk thou dois affirm and follou? Heir thou
muſt haue recours only vnto thy coryphe or author
of thy ſect for befor him ſuch nouelteis all

vhat ignorāce, vhat impudēce to quyit

glorius Martyrs vho haue by thair incredibill
holines, vōderfull miracles, and precieus blood
plāted, vatt erit and propagat the church of God,

darſt you (I ſay) affirm tham all to haue bene
bot ignorant idolators hauing no greter reſon
for the bot becaus you ād the author of thy ſect
vnderſtādit better the ſens of ſcriptur nor euer
any of tham did: as if thy ſpreit (vhilk you imaginis
to be the ſpreit of God and tharfor vill not
ſubmit it to any mans ſpreit preceding the) var
to be preferrit vnto our ſpreit vho diffyding in
our auin Knouleg knouit vith Fear after the
counſall of the Apoſtle and doth captiuat our
ſpreitts and opinion vnto ſuch ancients as vndoutely
had the ſpreit of God in more abondan
ce nor thou canſt be thocht to haue it till by thy
vorks thou ſall declair the lyik pouer of the
ſpreit to be in the yat vas in tham. O Chriſtian
Socrates vhois cheif knouleg vas to knou no

knou all things mote nor any preſent or preceding
thame. Ve knou notuithſtanding yat our
foliſs predeceſſor ſerching only to knou more

ſeditiuſe mariam bragging to much yat ſche
had knouleg and the ſpreit of God as much as
Moyſes had hir body vas ſtrik in vith leprocy to
mak hir vnderſtand yat ſuch mad apprehenſiōs
of knouleg var bot leproſeis of the mynd. Ve
knou yat one of the anciēts hes ſaid yat knouleg
vith ſobrietie is ſuir knouleg: Ve knou yat in
one place of ſcriptur it is ſaid knou or vnderſtand

to much of his knouleg knouit no thing at all,

and in the thrid yat thair is better hoip of â verey
fooll nor of one yat eſtemit him ſelf to knou
much.
            Vold thou then knou the incertenty of thy
ſpeculatyue knouleg, thou muſt go à litill out
frō it. For as thai yat valk in à miſt do not ſee it
ſo veill as thai yat ſtand vpon à hill vyid from it:
So fareth it in diſcerning of our oune knouleg
vhoſe propertie is to blīd thā that truſt to much

euin as à Rauen firſt of all pikit out the poor

ſicht in ſuch ſort as you can not rychtly
iuge
                  •
                betuix vanitie and veritie: It bindit the in

the many digniteis ād making the tkink you
art capable of vhatſoeuer thy hart can conſait. it
preſented vnto the many fair and pretieux Clothes
bot in no caſe may thou look vithin the
peices or cary thā to be diſcernit vyth the licht:
it had 400 fals Prophets to flatter the as Achab
had and to keap the from the hearing of Micheas
coūſall (yat is from the church vhilk vold
tell the the treuth) it had à 1000.3. King 22. cūning fiſchars
to giue the fair bait bot all furniſit vith dāgerus
hookes.Apoc. 17. It hes infinit ſtrūpets to offer the drink

poyſon. it lakit not at all occaſions ſum alluring

Iaëll to tempt the vith the milk of à glorius

thair hāds to murther the vhen you fallit à ſleepe:
it had in eury corner à flattring Ioab and fals
Iudas to kiſſe, to kill and to betray the.
            Finally it hes all arguments and allurments
to caus the glorifie thy ſelf and contem vthers:
vold you then perfyitlie ſee thy auin infirmitie

bot I viſs the aſcend vnto the montane vhar
Cryſt is transfigurat or tranſſubſtantiar yat is to

Apoſtolique Romane ſett vpon the top of à

            O yat you vold vith vnfenzit hart indelaitly
aſcend this montane and mak all the Sancts of

finally all men and vemen of thy nation young

you vold ſett forduart in this courſe ād ſay vyth
yat ould champion of Cryſt Ieſus Sanct Hieroſm:
if my father ſtood veping on his knees befor
me and my mother hanging on my nek
behind me, and all my brethring, ſiſters, childring
and kinsfolk houling round about to retene
or hinder me from this happy reſolution, I
ſuld fling of my mother to the ground, diſpyiſe
all my kinred, rin ouer my father and tread him
vnder my feet tharby to run vnto Cryſt vhen he
callit on me. Beuar, beuat my dearly belouit to
giue Cryſt Ieſus occaſion to ſay vnto you as once
he ſaid vnto Ieruſalem. Ieruſalem Ieruſalem
hou oft vold I haue collected thy childring as
the hē doth hir chickins vnder hir vings bot you
vold not, tharfor thy hous ſall be left deſolat.
Beuar lyk the hoggish Geraſens to prefer your
ſuyne yat is to ſay your ſluggish and laſie opiniōs

excuſe your ſelf lyik theiſs mentionat in the 14.
of Luc. ſaying you haue bocht à ferm and yok of
