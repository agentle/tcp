that exhorteth and preacheth, &c. Therfore
doo we exhort and preach: but they
which haue eares to heare: doo obedientlye
heare vs: they which haue not, that
thing commeth to passe in them which
is written, That hearing they shoulde
not heare: hearing with the sence of
theyr bodie, they shoulde not heare with
the assent of theyr bodie. But why the
one haue (eares to heare) and the other
haue not, that is to saye, why it is giuen
vnto the one of the Father to come vnto
the Sonne, and is not giuen vnto the
other, who hath knowne the minde of

be therefore denyed, because that which
is hydden can not be comprehended or

                        Rom. 5. 11. But yet that which God
doth gratifye, benefyte, or pleasure vs
with all, is not so as the offence, for if
through the offence of that one, many
be dead, muche more the grace of God,

and the gyfte by grace, which is of one
man Iesus Christ, hath abounded vnto
many.
                     16. Neyther is the gyfte so, as that
which entred in by one that sinned: for
the faulte entred in of one offence vnto
condempnation: but that which God geueth,
is geuen of many offences vnto
iustification.
                     17. For if by one offence, death raigned
through one, much more shall they
which receyue that abounding grace, &
gyfte of righteousnesse, raigne in lyfe
through one, that is Iesus Christ.
                     20. Moreouer, the lawe entreated that
the offence shoulde bee increased: but
where sinne increaseth, there grace aboundeth
much more.

that we shewe what wee thinke is espatiallye

the Preaching and also peculyar applying
of it. For where as it seemeth to
many to bée so harde,The cause vvhy this most necessarie and comfortable doctrine of God his election seemeth to many to be so hard and straunge. that they flee from
it as from a rocke, this is to be attributed,
or geuen partlie to the lewdnesse
and arrogancie, or pryde of men: partly
also to the lacke of foresyght in some,

otherwyse are faithfullie and truely declared.
               
                  Therefore as concerning those first,
which sinne of mallice, it belongeth vnto
God alone to amend their fault, which
doubtles he hath allwayes done in his
time, and wyll lykewise do hereafter in
those, who me in the ende he hath purposed
to haue mercy on: and as for the

to denye such thinges as doo wholy

of God, vvherein finallie both Christ

his steppes, doeth rest and staie.
(4) For vvhen as perceiueraunce or continuaunce
of faith is required vnto saluation,
to vvhat purpose haue I faith, (5)
if I be not certaine of the gift of perceiueraunce
or continuaunce to the ende?
And yet is there no neede to feare least
this doctrine shoulde make vs negligent
and dissolute or carelesse. (6) For this
peace of conscience, whereof we speake,
doeth greatlie differre from foolishe securitie
or carelesnesse,peace of conscience dependeth vpon predestination. and he that is the
sonne of God, (7) for asmuch as hee is
ledde by the spirite of God, vvyll neuer
take occasion of slouthfulnesse, by the
consideration of God his benefites.
Therefore if this doctrine bring but this
one fruite, that by the aide thereof vvee
maie learne to strengththen our faith against
all thinges that happen, it is manifest
rhat the chiefe grounde of our saluation
is ouerthrowne by them, vvhich
because they measure God after the

small measure of their braine, doo oppugne

                  NOwe this is the vvaie to applie this
doctrine. The vvorkes of God, euen

a man can not iudge of them, but after
twoo sortes, to wyt, either after they
are paste, or else by the disposition of
the seconde causes, vvhich by long vse
hee hath knowne to portende or geue a
token of some certaine ende, as is woont
to come to passe in thinges that fall out
naturallie, in vvhich notwithstanding
                        •
                     
men are vvonderfulle dymme sighted.
Therefore in this point, that is of all other
most hard, it is no maruaile though
the iudgement of man bee driuen into
suche a narrowe straite,

iudgement consisteth, or standeth in the
obseruation, and marking of those causes,
vvhich do exceede or passe all power
of nature, vvee must needes flee some
vvhither else, to vvyt

doeth no doubt bring vs also a more certaine
iudgement.

vvitnesse,Hovv a sure vvitnesse of our election maie bee had. that whomesoeuer God hath
Predestinate or foreordained in his eternall
purpose, to adopte or choose vnto
sonnes through Iesus Christ in him self,

hee is in such sort an instrument, that
hee also worketh by his owne inwarde

instrumentes soeuer he worketh, worketh
alwayes well.
            
               ¶Nowe hée so worketh by those instruments,
as he doeth not onely suffer
them to worke, neither onely moderate
or rule the euent or thing that falleth
out, but also hée rayseth them vp, styrreth,
moueth, guideth, and that which is
greatest of all he createth thē, to the end
that he might worke by them, which he
hath appointed: all which thinges God

            ¶For as often as one euyll man sinneth 
either against him selfe, or against
another wicked person, God without any
sinne maketh, eyther that the euyll
man taketh vengeaunce vpon himselfe,
or that euyll men shall punishe other euyl
men, with such punishment as they
haue deserued: both which workes of
God are most righteous: and by such examples
of his iudgementes, God lyfteth
vp & comforteth those that are his.
            ¶But so often as wicked men do hurt 
the good, the wicked men sinne, & in the

be sayde to obey God, because all be it
God by them bryngeth by

paine of sinne agreeth not but to the
vicious and saultie qualytie, which is
wholy in the working instrument.

good instrumentes then by the euyl, for
besides y• hée worketh his worke by the
good instruments, the good instruments
also do worke their owne worke by the
same force & effiacy which the Lord geueth
vnto thē: finally the Lord worketh
his worke by them, and also worketh in
them to wyll & to performe. But by the
wicked, as by Satā, or by men, in so far
as they are not regenerate or borne anew,
as often as the Lorde executeth
or perfourmeth the iust counselles and
decrees of his euerlasting wyll, hée in
deede sheweth forth his strength and efficacy
in his worke by them, eyther not
knowing o

               tteth lose the
reines vnto Sathan, to whome by hys

                ¶Therefore we doo not refuse this
terme, suffering, or graunting, neyther
yet came it in our mindes, to says
that God so worketh in the euyll, as hee
doeth in the good. But because that Sophisters
haue corrupted the difference
of wyll and sufferaunce, which Augustine
no doubt tooke of the Gréekes, and
they receyued from Augustine, therfore
doo we s
                  •
               atly refuse it.
            
                ¶For the Sophisters set wyll against
permission, or sufferaunce: wherof doth

But contrarywise, least we shoulde eyther
take from God his endles and vnmeasurable
power, or after the opinion
of the Epicures, say as the thing indéede
is, that God neither worketh any thing
by instruments, but wyllyngly, nor yet
suffereth the instrumentes to worke,
but wyllingly, yet in suche forte that
what soeuer hee worketh, hee worketh
most iustly and what soeuer he permitteth
or suffreth he most iustly suffereth.
            
               ¶And God worketh in respe
                  •••
               e of 
his owne worke: and permitteth or suffereth
in respecte of the worke that the
euyll instrumentes doo of their own
                  •
               
accorde worke, or in so farre as they are
actiue and not passiue instrumentes,
that wée may keepe the termes vsed in
the scholes. Yet doth God iustly suffer
the thing that these instrumentes vniustly
worke for because that sinnes, in
so farre as they are suffered by God
that wylleth, are not sinnes: but punishmentes
of sinne. For with God it is a
iust thing to punish sinnes with sinnes.
But these selfe same actions in so farre
as they come from Sathan, and euyll
men prouoked by Sathan and their
owne concupisence or lust, are so farre
sinnes, which the Lord in his time doth
iustly punish. For the Lord doth neuer
suffer sinnes so far as they are sinnes,
nay he doth alwayes forbid them.
            ¶Neyther is this consequence or 
reason good: God wylleth all thinges,
therefore he aloweth all things. For he
wylleth many thinges, and therefore

suffereth them, not because hée simplye
aloweth of them, but after a certaine
sort, for he aloweth them, so farre as hee
suffereth them, euen so farre as they are
no sinnes, as we sayde euen nowe: But
he disaloweth & punisheth them, so farre
as he hath respect or loketh vnto the euyl
instrumentes, whose actions they are.

connexion of causes is dylygenly to bee
obserued, because of the papists whiche
haue miserably confounded & conuerted
this doctrine thus, that almighty God
so farreforth as hée foreséeth mans merites

whersoeuer election goeth before, there

                  n. which is to consider
                  •
               
whether a man in this lyfe maye be
certaine of his election. To answere
this question, we haue first to vnderstand:
that although our election and
vocation simply in déede he knowen to
GodElection knovvn
                     •
                   to

                  mply. onely him selfe a Priore: yet not
withstanding it may be knowne to euery
particular faithful man a Posteriore:
that is, by meanes:Election knovven to man by meanes. whiche meanes is
fayth in Christ Iesus crucified, for so
much as by his fayth in Christ, a man is
iustified, and therebye made the childe

of saluation, reason must needes leads
the same to bée then the chylde of election
chosen of God vnto euerlasting 
                  •
               yfe:
for howe can a man be 
                  •
               aued but by consequence,
it followeth that hee must bée
elected.
            And therefore of election is truely
sayde,Faith is th
                     •
                   meanes vvhereby vve be certified of our saluation.

A posteriore:
               De electione iudicandum est A posteriore
                     •
                  
                that is to saye, We must
iudge of election by that whiche commeth
after, that is, by our fayth and beléefe
in Christ: which fayth although in
tyme it followeth after election: yet is it
the proper and immediate cause assygned
by the Scripture: which not onely
iustifyeth vs, but also certifyeth vs of
the election of God.
            Wherevnto, lykewise well agréeth
this saying: Election albeit in God,
it be the first, yet to vs it is the last opened.Election first knovvn to God, and last opened to man.
And therefore begynning first
with creation: I come from thence to
redemption, and iustification by fayth,
and so to election. Not that fayth is the
cause efficient of election: being rather
the effecte thereof, but is to vs the

cause certifycatorie, or the cause of our
certifycation: whereby we are brought
to the feeling and knowledge of our election
in Christ. For albeit that election
fyrst be certaine in the knowledge of
God, yet in our knowledge fayth onely
that wée haue in Christ, is the thing
that geueth to vs our certyficate & comfort
of this election.
            Wherefore whosoeuer desireth to be
assured that he is one of the elect number
of God: let him not clyme vp to heauen
to knowe, but let him descend into
himselfe, and there searche his fayth in
Christ the sonne of God: Which if hée

            Nowe then for so muche as we sée
fayth to be the grounde wherevpon dependeth
the whole condition of our iustifying: let vs discusse in lyke maner,

                  vvhat faith is

what is this faith, wherof the scripture
so much speaketh of, for the more plaine
vnderstanding of the symple. For many
kyndes there be of fayth:Diuerse kindes of faith. As a man
maye beléeue euery thing that is true:
yet not euery trueth doeth saue, neyther
doeth the beleeuing of euery trueth iustifie
a man: He that beleeueth that God
created all thinges of nought, beléeueth
trueth: He that beléeueth that God is a
iust God, that he is omnipotent,Euery truth hath his faith, But euerie truth iustifieth not that he
is mercyfull: that he that is true of promyse
beléeueth well, and holdeth the

trueth.no more doeth euerie faith
                     •
                  
                So he that beléeueth that God
hath his election from the begynning,
and that he also is one of the same elect
and Predestinate, hath a good beleefe
and thynketh well. But 
                  •
               et this beleef
                  •
               
alone, except it be seasoned with another
thing, wyll not serue to saluation
                  •
               
As it a
                  •
               ayled not the olde Iewes, which
so thought of themselues, and yet thinke
to this daye: to bée onely Gods electe
people.
            Onely the fayth which auayleth to
saluation is that,Faith the action 
                     ••
                   vv Christ the
                     •

                     •
                   of faith. whose obiect is the body
and passion of Christ Iesus crucifyed:
so that in the a

               te of iustifying these
two: fayth and Christ haue a mutuall
relation,Faith and Christ are relatiues. and must alwayes concurrs
together fayth, as the action which apprehendeth:
Christ as the obiect which
is apprehended.
            For neyther doth the passion of Christ
saue without fayth:Christ vvith out faith saueth not. neyther doeth fayth
helpe, except it be in Christ. As we see
the body of man sustayned by bread and
drinke
                  •
                not except the same be receaued,Faith vvithout Christ

                  .
               
and conueyed into the stomacke, and yet
neyther doth tho receyuing of any thing
sustaine mans body, except it be meate
and drinke, which haue power to geue
nourishment. In lyke sort it is with
fayth: for neyther doeth the beléeuing
of euery thing saue. But onely fayth in
the blood of Christneyther doeth againe
the same blood of Christ profite vs, except
by fayth it be receaued: And as the
sonne being the cause of all lyght, 
                  ••
               y

                  ••
               esse they wyll open theyr eyes, to
receaue the lyght: So the passion of
Christ is the efficient cause of saluation:
But fayth is the condition whereby
the sayde Passion is to vs effectuall.
            And that is the cause, why wee

                  •
               aye with the Scrypture, that fayth
onelye iustifyeth vs, not excludinge
thereby all other e
                  •
               terne causes, that
goe before fayth: As grace, mercye,
election, vocation,
                  
                     ••
                  orace Election. Vocation Christes death, causes externe of our saluation. the death of

Christ, &c. All which be externe causes
working our saluation through fayth.
                  
                     •
                  aith onelie intern cause of mans saluation.
But when we saye that fayth onely iustifyeth
vs: the meaning thereof is this,
that of all internall actions, motions, or
operations in man, geuen to him of
God, there is no other that contenteth,
and pleaseth God, or standeth before his
iudgement,Faith is an action in man, but not of man. or can helpe any thing to
the iustifying of man before him: but
onely this one action of fayth in Christ
Iesu the sonne of God.
            For although the action of praying,
fasting,Vertues and vvorkes of charitie, though they bee good gifts of God in man, yet they serue not to iustification. almes, patience, charitie, repentaunce,
the feare and loue of God bee
his gyfts in man, and not of man, geuen
of God to man: yet bee none of all these
actions in man, imputed of God to saluation,
but onely this one action of faith
in man, vpon Christ Iesus the sonne of
God. Not that the action it selfe of beleeuing:
As it is a qualyty in man doeth so
deserue: but because it taketh that dignity
of the obiect. For as I sayde in the
acte of iustifying: Fayth, as it is an action
in man, is not to be considered alone:

but must euer goe with this obiect,
and taketh his vertue thereof. Lyke as
the looking vp of the olde Isralytes,Faith looketh his dignitie of his obiect. dyd
not of it selfe procure any health vnto
them: but the promyse made in the obiect,
which was the brasen Serpent,
wherevppon they looked: gaue them
health by their looking vp.Looking vp to the brasē Serpent, and beleeuing vppon the bodie of Christ compared. Euen so after
lyke sort, are we saued by our fayth, and
spyrituall looking vppe to the bodye of
Christ crucifyed, which fayth to defyne,
is this.
            To beléeue Iesus Christ to bée the
sonne of the lyuing God, sent into this
worlde: by his death to satisfye for our
sinnes, and so to receaue the same.
            And thus much touching election and
fayth,The errour of the Papistes, periecting the minde of Gods Testament, hovve and vvherein. with the order and explycation of
the causes necessary to bée considered in
our saluation: whereby maye appeare
howe for tho pretenced Catholiques doo
swarue from the ryght minde of the
Scriptures. For where the Scriptures
in declaring the causes of saluation, doo
sende vs onely to fayth, as the onely
condition, whereby these causes haue

theyr workyng: these Catholiques doo

               Hereas three yeeres
ago, dearely beloued. I did
write of this matter of
Election & Reprobation,
whiche is called Predestination,
in a certayn Commentarie
vpon the Prophet Malachie,
by the occasion of this text:
            
               I haue lou
                     •
                  d Iacob, and I haue hated Esau.
The whiche Treatise by the rage of persecution,
partly perished, and part dyd
come of late to my handes: accompting
this doctrine so necessarie, that vppon all
occasions it ought with reuerence to bee
vttred to the glory of God, whiche so wonderfully,
appeareth in this his riche mercie
towarde vs, whome he chooseth from
the fylthe of sinne, to serue him in righteousnesse,
and to the beating downe of our
corrupt nature, whiche without this, eyther
moūteth by pride, vnto presumption,

or falleth by infidelyty to desperation. Because
that without some taste of this diuine
prouidence in Predestination, there
can bee no fayth, but eyther a doubtfull
wauering, leading to dispayre, which wée
haue lefte in the Papisterye wyles wée
looked to our owne weakenesse and infirmitie,
not able to endure one houre in
the way of righteousnesse: or else a vayne
presumption of feyned holynesse, whyles
wee beeholde our owne beleefe and good
works, or the perfection that we doo imagine
in our owne selues, as doo the Annabaptistes.
Therefore I thoughte it good
according to my simple Talent, to testifie
this truthe agayne vnto the worlde,
at the Printing of this worthy Table of
the great lerned man, Master Beza, which
is set forth in French, Latin, and Italian,
and now into Englyshe, translated by our
brother VV. VVhittingham: wherein
is most euidēntly set forth before our eies
the chyefe ground of this doctryne, and the
principall poyntes thereof are so deepely
opened, that there seemed to wante nothing
that was possible in fewe lynes to

be vttered, yet for the shortnesse therein
all thinges can not be conteyned, but that
some briefe lessons for the vnlearned (who
hath not theyr sences fully exercised wyth
such déepe sentences) may well be adioyned,
as euery man hereafter shall héerevnto
be moued by the spirit of God working
in their hartes (that many bearing
wytnesse to the truthe of this most profitable
doctrine nowe reuealed) the mercies
of God in choosing his chyldren, may
more and more, daye by daye be disclosed:
and by the witnesse of dyuers consentyng
togyther in one, God the father of our
Lord Iesus Christ may be gloryfyed. For
heerein chyefly standeth his prayse, honor,
and glory, that these his wonderfull mercyes
toward hys Electe maye be praysed.
Nowe there is no meane more apte, nor
doctrine more conuenient to establysh the
fayth of the Sayncts, than to certyfye by
the Scryptures, that God hath chosen

adoption grafted in Christ, who are called
of the eternall purpose: bicause it is God
that iustifieth, and who dare condempne
them? It is Christ that is giuen for them,
& how shall not all things with him be geuen
to them also? For them that he knew
before, them he ordeyned before, that they
should be lyke fashioned to the image of
his sonne, and whome hee appoynted before,
those also hee called, and whome hée
called those also he iustified, and whom he
iustifyed those also be glorifyed, that his
eternall purpose and counsell of God, béeing
once reuealed to his Saincts, by the
effectuall vocation and calling, whiche is
the iustifycation of fayth wrought in their
heartes by the holy spirite, they can no
longer doubt neyther of Election, Predestination,
saluation, or glorifycation. Neither
can any thing more beate downe
mans nature, and the pride of his vayne
heart, than to behold the maiestie of God,

making them by grace so farre vnlyke
one to the other, who were bothe one, altogither
by nature the chyldren of wraths of
vengeance, & damnation: as the wonderful
example of Iacob & Esau doeth declare,
of whom the Lord pronounceth that
he loueth the one, & hateth the other, before
they were borne, and the terrible sentence
agaynst Pharao, whome the Scripture
affyrmeth that God raysed vp to shewe
vppon him his power, and hardened hys
hart, to make his name knowne, and such
like, which euery where are set before our
eyes, to cause man to fall downe before
God, and to feare his iudgementes.
But our Aduersaries obiect agaynst vs,
that this doctrine is an offence to many,
and that some abuse it to carnall lybertie.

we not prohibite the sweete floures from
the Bées, bicause Spiders sucke thence
their poyson, no more than wée maye
stoppe the sunne to shyne, bycause it

hurteth sore eyes. But that it may bée the
glad tydings of saluation to the assurance
of the fayth of the one, and a cleare testymony
of cōdemnation of the other, to the
beating downe of the pryde of man, thys
glorious counsel of the mightie God, ought
vnto all in this cleare reuelation of the
Gospell, to bee offered, opened, and publyshed.
            Wherefore by the good wyll of God, we
entende to speake of this greate matter,
none other wayes, neyther in any other
sorte, then the open Scriptures shall approue
our sayings. Therfore we say with
the holy Apostle Sayncte Paule: Blessed

chyldren by Iesus Christ. Ephes.
                     •
                  . And
thoughe there come some wycked men,

whiche were long before apoynted to this
iudgement, whiche doo turne the grace of
our God to lasciuiousnesse & wantonnesse,
as holy Iude saythe: yet knowe wée that
wée are chosen by Iesus Christe that the
glory of his grace, hys fauour and mercy
towards vs might be praysed. For we are
the electe and chosen kyndred, and hys
people by purchase, that we shoulde shewe
the vertue of him whiche hath called vs
foorth of darknesse into this maruellous
lyght.
            This people ordayned to saluation only
beleeueth. Act. 13. For this Electe people
onely was Christ sent into this world. To
them onely is the worde of saluation sent,
as Peter sayth: To the Elect by the foreknowledge
of God the Father. 1. Pet. 1.
Then to know what this election of God
is, and what in the Scriptures it doth signifye.
We describe and define election to
bée the frée choyce of the good wyll of the almighty
God, appoynting and prescribing
in the booke of lyfe before the begynning
of the worlde, whome he wyll haue to bée
saued, and coumpted amongest the iust.

Whome hée will haue holy and without
faulte before him to be his children, by adoption
to set forth his glory. This choyse,
his choosing, this aforeappoynted purpose
and ordinaunce of God, is aboundauntlye
set forthe in the first chapter to the Ephesians.
That this commeth of the free wil of
God and his onely grace, freely without

of the Papists and Anabaptists)

before

               he children were borne, when

they had neyther done good nor bad, that
the purpose of God whiche is by Election
mighte stande, it was sayde to hir, not for
the cause of workes, but by the grace of the
caller, the elder shal serue the younger. As
it is written, saythe hée: Iacob I loued,
but Esau I hated. Of the booke of lyfe,
Moyses speaketh, Exod. 32. And Christ
himselfe, Luk, 10. Saying to his Apostles:
Ioy you and be glad, for your names are
written in the booke of life in the heauens.
And in the. 69. Psalme it is spoken against
the wicked. Let them not be written
amongst the Iust, and put them forth
of the booke of life. And agaynst the false
Prophet. Ezechiel. 13. Hée shall not bee in
the counsaile of my people, nor written in
the booke of the house of Israell. There
be two finall causes also of this eternall
purpose of the election, the whiche Paule
rehearseth in the first chapter to the Ephesians,
the one toucheth God, the other
perteyneth to man. He hath El
                  •
               cted

worlde (sayth the Apostle) that wée mighte

                  •
               wereth

the wicked, which woulde abuse the
mercies of God to their lust. Againe it followeth.
He hath Predestinate vs, that he
myght choose vs to be his chyldren, that
his name may be praysed. And this stoppeth
the mouthes of all our aduersaryes
that saye, that this doctrine is not to the
prayse of God: so that they must cease to
sclaunder this doctrine, vnlesse they wyll
hynder the glory of God, and denye the open
Scriptures.
            Now it is to bée noted and marked dylligently,
that this worde election is taken
after two sortes in the Scripture, sometymes
as it sygnifyeth absolutely the free
choyse, wyll, and appoyntment of God,
without the respecte of the reuelation of
the worde and message of saluation. And
thus speaketh the holy Apostle Saint Paul
of Election, saying of the carnall Iacob:
They were enimyes concerning the gospell
for your cause, but concerning the Election,
they are beloued for their parents.
For the gyftes of God, and his calling are
suche, that he can not repent. Euen as
you once were mysbeléeuers from God,

but nowe haue attayned mercy, by theyr
mysbeléefe, that they should attayne mercie
also.
            This Election expresseth absolutely
the secret purpose of God, without the respect
of reuelation of the woorde, or any of
our workes following. Under this first
kinde of Election were those hundreth
and twentye thousande, whiche God
dyd choose and kéepe vnto hymselfe in
Niniuie amongst the Idolaters, and the
seuen thousande which God dyd leaue for
himselfe in Israell, in the third booke of
Kings the. 19. chap. Yea, those that yet are
not, are thus elect, chosen and amongst al
nations both Iewes in this long blindnes,
& banishmente from their cuntrey amongst
the Turkes in theyr Idolatrous
wickednes, yea amongst the Edomites, the
Sabees, the Indians, and Ethiopians.
            
            And in the late blyndnesse of the Popishe
church, wherein wee togither wyth
our fathers were altogether Idolatrous,
all Hypocrites and counterfaite Christians,
thys absolute Election whereby the
mercyfull Lord God did reserue and kepe

his chosen vnto hym in all places, all
ages, all countreys, without respect of
personnes dyd most euydently appeare.
Howbeit this secreete of Election must
onely 
                  •
               ee lefte to the Maiestie of God,
where, when, howe, and whome he thereby
saueth and sheweth his mercy. For,
to the blynde iudgement of man all these
people rehearsed, and suche lyke seemeth
reiect, reprobate and cast awaye, as appeareth
by Ionas condempning the Niniuites,
by Elias condempning the Israelites,
and a long whyle, vntyll God had by myracle
from Heauen delyuered hym from
that errour, vnto the chyefe Apostle
Peter, iudging all the Gentyles to bee a
polluted people, farre from the fauour of
God.
            The seconde kynde of Election is
set 
                  •
               oorth and knowne, euydent and open
by the spirite of God, working in the harts
of the Elect and chosen by fayth, and trust
in God his promyses through Christ, teaching
vs that we are the chyldren of God
chosen to him selfe by Iesus Christ, from
the begynning, and therefore preparing

vs to an holy and blamelesse lyfe, to the
lawde & prayse of the grace of God. The
which Election besydes the dayly e
                  •
               perience
of our consciences maye bee approued
by the testymonies of these Scryptures
compared together. Esa. 59. Rom 8.
Ephesi. 1. Colos. 3. and a verie bryefe and
perfecte description of thys Election. 2.
Thes. 2. in these wordes. Wée ought to
thanke God that he hath chosen you from
the begynning, by the sanctifying of the
spyrite and the beleefe of the trueth, to the
which he hath called you by our Gospell,
to attayne the glorye of our Lorde Iesus
Christ. By this gratious election was
Iacob dearelye beloued in his Mothers
wombe, and Ieremie knowne vnto God
before hée was fashioned in his Mothers
wombe. Ieremie. 1. And to bee short, all
other the Electe of God are thus chosen,
sanctified, and beloued from the begyning
from before the foundations of the world,
frō euerlasting to euerlasting. For there
is no chaunge of tyme with God, seeing
that all thinges are present in his syght.
For vnto him a thousande yeares are but

one day, but the course & change of times
are in vs, our déedes, our knowledge, in
mans chaungeable wisdome.
            This Election must of necessitie driue
downe the pryde wée haue of our owne
strength, our owne power, our owne nature,
our owne frée wil, our owne merites,
our owne iustification of our owne workes,
and bryng vs to the feelynge of the
mighty power of God, which worketh all
in all things, to the restoring of all things
in our Christ, both in Heauen and Earth,
by whome wée are called into this state,
long before appointed accordyng to his
purposed pleasure, by whose power all
things are wrought, that we may boldly
say wyth the Apostle, who dare laye any
thing to the charge of the Elect of God? It
is God that iustifieth, who is hée that can
condemne? Who can seperate vs (whiche
are this chosen Iacob) from the loue of
God.
            Can affliction? Can anguish? Can persecution?
Can hunger? Can nakednes? Can
peryll? Can the sword? For I am perswaded,
sayeth he, that neyther death nor life,

nor Angel, nor power, nor things present,
eyther thinges to come, neyther heyght,
nor depth, neyther any creature can separate
vs frō the loue of God in Christ Iesu
our Lorde. Loe, this is the loue wherwith
the Lorde loueth his Iacob, whereby we
saye: O heauenly Father, Lord of heauen
and earth, it hath pleased thée that thou
myght shewe thy great goodnesse most lyberally
and freely towards vs, before that
we were, and therfore before we had done
eyther good or euyl, without any our merytes
or deseruinges onely through thy
frée mercy to elect and choose, ordaine and
appoint vs heyres of euerlasting lyfe, and
thereby to make all things pertayning to
our saluation, so fyrme and sure, that they
cannot stagger, wauer, nor fayle. Where
contrariwise if they dyd hang of our worthynesse,
we should euer be doubtfull, because
euery man is a lyar, & al our righteousnesse
is lyke a spotted cloath, and nothing
but counterfayte hypocrisie, wayed
in the ballaunce of thy seuere iustice. But
the grace of this thy frée Election maketh
vs most certaine & sure, séeing no creature

is able to take out of thy hande, O God.
Wherefore wée doo lawde and magnifye
thy name, worlde without ende. So bee
it.
            Now after this doctrine of election, and
loue of God towarde Iacob, the hating and
Reprobation of Esau, must lykewise be declared,
and though the aduersaries of this
doctrine doo seeme to denie that there is any
such Reprobation of the wycked, yet
the wordes are so plaine in Malachie and
Romanes. 9. that nothing can be more euident.
For what can be more plainely
spoken for this purpose, then that God
shoulde saye before the chyldren were
borne, that he hated Esau. What was
this b
                  •
               tred, but the Reprobation, Reiection,
and condemnation by God his owne
mo
                  •
               th of this wicked Esau, lyke as in the
last verse of the fyrst Psalme, where it is
sayde, that the Lorde knoweth the wayes
of the ius
                  •
               e
                  •
                (that is) he hath them wrytten
in his booke in the Heauens, 
                  •
               e loueth
them as is sayd of Iacob, he hath such care
ouer them, that they can not fall, but vnto
the glorye of God, and theyr owne commodity,

and by the course of the contraries
compared together in that Psalm: it should
be added, the Lord knoweth not the wicked,
like as Christ sayth it shall bée answered
vnto them, I knowe you not: the latter
parte of the verse is that the way
of the wicked shall perishe, so that it appeareth
to bee all one, not to bee elected,
accepted, and knowne of God, and to
perish, and to be as a Reprobate condemned.
And Felinus foorthe of Kimhy doth
note, that that parte of the laste verse of
the. 2. Psalme: God beeing angrye, you
shall perishe foorthe of the waye, dothe
expounde this of the fyrste Psalme, so
that the Election, knowledge, loue, and
fauour of God, and eternall saluation cannot
be separate: Like as his anger and hatred,
reprobation and condemnation consequently
doo followe, in Caine, Esau, Pharao,
Iudas, the Pharisées, and lyke obdurate
persons, so manifestly vttering them
selues to bée of that sort whome God alwayes
hated: The chyldren not of Abraham,
but as Christ answereth vnto them,
of their father the deuyl, who was a murtherer

from the begynning, lyke as his
chyldren haue bene also euer syth the begynning
of the world, and therefore must
of necessitie be hated of the most mercifull
Lorde, who is compelled by the order
of his workes, to vse these wicked roddes
and cruel scourges, for the chastisement of
his childrē, doing many times the works
straunge from his nature, that he may doo
his worke of his mercy, peculyar vnto his
nature: And than vtterly breake, hate, reiect,
and cast away into euerlasting fyre &
vtter destruction this rodde and scourge,
lyke a most merciful Father, fauoring his
children and hating the rodde. Lyke as he
sayth by his prophet: Woo vnto Assur the
rodde of my fury, and the staffe of my indignation,
and after promyseth to breake
the staffe and cast away the rodde. Psal. 10.
Suffering in the meane season, yet these
instruments of his wrath prepared vnto
destruction, with great patience, for this
ende that he maye vtter the ryches of his
glory, towards the vessels of glory, which
he hath prepared vnto glory.
            Thus was Pharao the manifest scourge

and rodde of God, to correct, to chastice, &
to exercyse the Israelytes, and to spreads
the power of God through all the worlde.
Therefore was Moyses sent vnto him,
with the rodde of God his mighty mercy,
to breake in sunder this rodde of chastisement.
And the Lorde sayd vnto Moyses,
I haue appoynted thée to bée the God of
Pharao, and Aaron thy brother shall be
thy Prophete, thou shalt speake vnto him
all that I commaunde thée. And he shall
speake vnto Pharao, to let go the chyldren
of Israel forth of his lande. But I wyll
harden his harte, sayeth the Lorde, and I
wyll, multyplie my sygnes and wonders
in Egypt, and hée shall not heare
you. And I wyll bryng myne Armie and
people 
                  •
               oorth of the Lande of Egypte, by
most greate iudgementes, and the Egyptians
shall know that I am the Lord.
Exod 12.
            
            Againe the Lorde sayth, Nowe shall
I stretche my hande to stryke thée, and
thy people with a plague, and thou shalt
peryshe from the earth, for therefore
haue I caused thée to stande (for so is

the Hebrewe worde) that I maye shewe
in thée my strength, and that my name
maye bée renowned through all the earth.
Exod 9. Then the Lorde sendeth a great
hayle, so that feelyng the hande of God the
tenth tyme, Pharao was compelled to
crye: The Lorde is iuste, and I and my
people are synners, as followeth in the
same Chapter. Yet for all this the Lorde
hardeneth his harte, that hée pursueth the
chyldren of Israel to his owne destruction.
Exod. 14. So that resysting the power
of God, he perysheth in this worlde, and
in the worlde to come, hee is appoynted
to the euerlasting fyre, prepared for the
Deuyll and his Angelles, by the iust
iudgement of the almighty Lorde: who
being refused and so openly resysted, iustlye
doeth geue ouer the wycked to theyr
owne Reprobate myndes, with greedynesse
to fulfyll theyr fleshlie desyres, and
obstinate purpose to prosecute that which
the Deuyll and the worlde wylleth them
to doo, and causeth them to heape vpon
theyr owne heades theyr owne dampnation,
treasuring and storing vp al theyr

lyfe long, workes deseruing the wrath
of God against the daye of his wrath and
vengeaunce, as the Apostle sayth to the
Romaines.
            
            This Reprobation then is the declaration
of God his seuere iustice and iust
iudgement, against the Serpent and his
séede, whome, by the worde of his eternall
wisedome hée hath accursed from the begynning,
and appoynted to euerlasting
torment. The which worke necessarie for
the procéeding of God his holy prouidēce,
Eternall and neuer ceasing regyment,
and gouernaunce, because it is the worke
of the wyll of the myghtie God, which is
the verie lawe, equity, and iustice it selfe,
frée from all affections, farre from all
faulte, cryme or sinne: It ought to bee
knowne vnto vs all, that all fleshe maye
tremble, and consider before whome it
standeth, euen before that great Lord and
mighty God, who hath power both ouer
the bodie and Soule to cast into hell fyre.
To whome no man may saye: what doest
thou? Being lyke the claye in the Potters
hande, or the staffe or axe in the hande

of the smyter. Who offendeth against no
lawe, bicause his godly wyll is the lawe it
selfe, and to knowe his pleasure, is to
know the lawe, to follow his wyl, is to doo
the lawe, so that of necessitye this great
Lorde is so farre & frée from al sinne, that
nothing is good but that which is wrought
by him, nothing can be euyll that he worketh
in his creatures. No, the fall of Lucifer
the father of the reprobate, doth vtter
his maiestie, doth shew his iustice, which
olde Satan and Father Deuyl, was worthily
cast downe into the bottome of Hell,
and eternally condempned to euerlasting
payne and torment, because he dyd so ambiciously
and proudly climbe vp aboue his
apointed place in the heauens. And where
the mallice of this olde serpent, caused Adam
the first man to mount aboue his estate,
to desyre to know good & euyl, lyke a
God, the maruellous mercy of God, and
inestimable loue towardes mankind caused
& compelled this wicked worke of the
Serpent to serue his glory, and to turne
to our great commodity and profyte, in
that he rayseth of the seede of man another

               Adam, most innocent and holy, agaynst
whom no Diuel, neyther any helly power
may preuayle, by whome we are not only
reconciled vnto God, and doo obteyne pardon
for this offence, but wée are borne a

We doo boldly beholde the course of
Gods working in our nakednesse, sinne,
and infirmitie, and magnifie, renowme,
and prayse our Lord God, which sheweth
his grace by our sinne, which vttereth his
power by our weaknesse, his wisedome by
our foolishnesse, which setteth forth his elect
vessels, his chosen
                  •
                Abels, by Caynits

first murtherer, and therfore manifestly of
the serpentes seede, appeareth euidently

Cayn, all sinnes and wickednesse. To vtter
that he abhorreth sinne, and hateth it,
béeing so farre contrarie from his nature,
which is iustice it selfe, contrarie from his
wyll, which is equitie, and his lawe which
is iudgement. In Pharao a childe of the
same father, reprobate, indurate, and accursed,
whome God stirred vp for the declaration
of his great power and mightie

wrought for his people, which nothing had
needed, neither had ben occasioned, if there
had not bene such a tyraunt soo indurate
and so obstinate, to withstande God & his

                we do learne héerby also y• power
of God, which the very Sorcerers, the
enimies of God were compelled to confesse
before Pharao. Exod. 8. Wée doo
learne moreouer the iustice of God, which
iustice Pharao him selfe was compelled
agaynste him selfe, to denounce and affirme.
Exod. 9. And finally wée may sée
expressed moste manifestly the fatherly
mercy of the God of Iacob, whiche dyd
giue the king and the whole people of Egypt
a pryce for his chosen Iacob. 
               
                  •

loue towardes Iacob, and the hatred towardes
Esa
                     •
                  . What shall wee speake of
Iudas and other, manifestlye reprobate,
whiche are compelled by the testimonye

of theyr owne consciences to pronounce
them selues wicked, and therefore to feare
god his seuere iustice and iust iudgement,
& to flye the refrom by the terrour of their
euill consciences, which is more sore than
a thousand witnesses, agaynst suche as
God doth leaue to their owne selues The
which terrible examples, the elect of God
                  •
               
hauing before their eyes, hath great cause
to prayse their heauēly father, through his
sonne Christ, who hath sent them his holy
spirit of comfort, which will neuer suffer
them to be tempted aboue that they are able
to suffer and to beare.
            But where we haue two kinde of men
that be aduersaries to this doctrine of Reprobation.
The one sorte vttering them
selues most manifest Reprobate, obstinate,
and wylfully wicked, crying and
blaspheming: we wyll followe our lusts,
what neede we to care howe we lyue, or
what we doo? If we be elected with Iacob,
wee shall bée saued, if wée bée reiecte and
cursed with Cham, wée shall bée damned.
These Lucifers, not submitting themselues
to the gouernance of God, carelesse

what becommeth of them, must be heat
                  •
               
downe with the consideration of the maiestie
and mightie power of God, whiche
suffereth not one sparrowe to fall vppon
the earth without his wyll & prouidence,
neyther one hear to fall from the head of
his elect and chosen, howe fiercely so euer
they shall rage agaynst them.
            Wherefore (O you Serpentes séede)
howe soeuer you shall be offended with
this that I shall speake, knowe this, that
as the mightie God hathe made the scattered
sandes able inoughe to stay the raging
Seas: so shall your proude waues
of your boyling stomacks and our busie,
heades, be broken and brought full lowe
where and when it shall like the Lorde of
all fleshe by these his weake vessels. And
licence must you aske, as did your father
the diuel
                  •
                executing his tyrannie vpon the
good mā 
               Iob, as we reade in the first chapter
of that Hystorie, before you can lay
hands eyther of body or goods of his chosen,
and therein shall you be limitted and
appoynted (as there appeareth) how farre
you shall be able to extend your violence.

For God holdeth your hartes in his hand
be you neuer so great tyrants, & can soone
cause you to faynt & fayle from your furie,
turning your harts round about as him liketh
best. And bicause you thus blaspheme
God in words & déedes, following your father
Lucifer, abusing Gods creatures, and
despising his benefytes, his tollerance, and
his long sufferan
                  •
               e, which might moue you
to repentance (as holy Paule warneth) you
treasure vp for your selues, euen wrath &
vengeance agaynst the day of vengeance.
I doo feare nothing at all to offende you
with my writing, neither do you passe any
thinge at all what is written or spoken,
though you vse to sweare, stampe, & stare
for a little space in a furious rage, when
you heare and feele things contrarie to
your poyson. But the scriptures of God,
all good writinges, all truthe, vnto suche
dogs and hogs are vttered to this purpose,
that they may be a testimony of condemnation
of the light of Gods truth reiected
and despised. Therefore for the elect of God
that they may vnderstand the course of
Gods working in al his creatures, & reuerence

his maiestie, and magnifie and renoume
his holy name is this written. Yet
doubtlesse doo I know amongst the chiefe
vessels & chosen children of God, there bée
many whiche haue not attayned to this
poynt of doctrine of Electiō & Reprobatiō,
whom I am very loth to offend, and therfore
I desire thē for the loue of God to suffer
me quietly without their griefe to vtter
vnto other the cōfort of my conscience,
which I haue hereby vndoubtedly receyued:
like as I haue many times harkened
vnto them in the cōtrarie. First praying
thus both of vs together vnto our heauenly
father, knowledging our owne infirmitie
& weaknesse. O father in the heauens,
whatsoeuer we are, whatsoeuer we haue,
whatsoeuer we knowe, it is onely by thy
frée grace, for we were by nature the childrē
of wrath, & we are not borne a new of
fleshe & blood, eyther of the séede of man, or
of the wyl of man, flesh & blood can not reueale
the misteries of thy heauenly kingdome
vnto vs. But by thy blessed wyl, are
we that we are, & by the same knowe we
that we know: therefore (O father) doo we

commyt into thy handes onely our saluation.
If our knowledge be small, yet we
doubte nothing but that we are the chyldren
of thy euerlasting kyngdome, and
therefore by thy mightye power, we shall
growe when it shall be thy pleasure, to a
more full and ryuer knowledge of a more
perfyte age, wherein our fayth shall bee
fully able to comprehend and receyue the
breadth, depth, heyght, & largenesse of thy
great mercyes, and gracious promyses.
But séeing this power of full knowledge
and perfecte reuelation, passeth all power
naturall, and remayneth onely in thy power,
and the light of thy spirite (O Lord).
Doo thou what shall please thée, to open to
vs thy seruaunts and chyldren, depending
of thy handes, so much of the lyght of thy
countenaunce, and at such tymes as shall
seeme good to thy wisedome and fatherly
mercye. In the meane tyme thus re
                  •
               tyng
wholy vpon thée, neyther can we dispaire,
neyther wyll we 
                  •
               be too much carefull, although
wee can not attayne to the knowledge
of many of thy workes, neyther to
the vnderstanding of many places of the

scriptures, but we wyll confesse vnto thé
                  •
               
the weakenesse of our fayth, wayting alwayes
for further reuelation of thy glorious
lyght to be vttred vnto vs, when thou
shalt think of thy Fatherly beneuolence &
goodnesse méete and conuenient, knowing
most surely that thou wylt pitie our chyldishe
infanci
                  •
               , and cause the same to serue
for thy glory and our greate commoditie,
séeing that we doo erre and are chyldishe,
as sonnes before such a Father which can
not put off his Fatherlye pytie, but rather
as thou hast brought vs vnto thée, to
be the heyres of thy kingdome by the blood
of thy naturall sonne, so we bée most sure
that thou wylt lighten vs in the end, with
the full fruition of the bryght lyght of thy
countenaunce, that we maye see thée and
know thée as this thy sonne our redéemer
knoweth thée, yea, sée thée our Father,
face to face, and know as we be knowne.
Thus rest wée onely of thy hande to increase
our knowledge at thy good pleasure,
O mighty Lorde and most mercyful
Father. So be it.
            If you can thus submytte your selues,

good brethren, to the wisedome of God,
working in vs weakelyngs what him lyketh.
All the stumblyng stockes whiche
might offend you, may eas
                  •
               ly be remoue
                  •
               .
There be two things especially which doo
séeme to stande against this doctrine of
Election and Reprobation, or of God his
gouernaunce and prouidence, for all is
one in effect, the one toucheth God, the other
man. The fyrst and pryncipall is,
leaste that the wicked doo make God the
Aucthour of synne in the Reprobate
                  •
                the
which doubt, we maye remoue fowre maner
of wayes.
            Fyrst, by the aucthoritie of Scriptures.
Secondlye, by the testimonie of theyr
own consciences which be the reprobate.
Thirdly, by the nature of sinne. Fowrthly,
by the maiestie of God, which is bound
to none of his creatures, to make hym
this or that vessell. For the fyrst, Saint
Iames sayeth: Let no man saye when he
is tempted, that he is tempted of God,
for God, as he can not bée tempted with
euyll, so neyther doeth hée tempte any
man. But euerye man is tempted,

drawne awaye, and entysed of his owne
luste and concup
                  •
               scence. Then the luste
when it hath conceyued, bryngeth foorth
synne. Iames. 
                     •
                  . And euen thus it appeared
in the fyrste fall of mankynde.
Fyrste, though the Lorde our God had
warned and commaunded the contrary,
oure olde enemye styrreth the concupiscence
and lust of the Woman, with the
goodnesse, pleasauntnesse and beautie of
the Apple, then her lust conceyuing this,
bringeth foorth synne, entysing also her
husband, to the breaking of God his commaundementes.
Genes. 3. But contrarywise,
sayeth Iames in the same place.
Iam. 1. least you should erre and conceyue
any euyll opinion of God, euery good gyfte
and euerie perfyte gyfte is from aboue,
descending from the Father of lyght, with
whom is no variablenesse, neither change
into darkenesse, that hée shoulde geue
nowe good things, nowe euyll, now lyght,
nowe darkenesse. No, sayth the Apostle
Paule, let God be true, and all men lyars.
Can God be vniust? Howe shall he then
iudge the worlde? Rom. 3. Againe, God

sayeth by his Prophete Ezechiel: I wyll
not the death of a sinner, but I wyl rather
that the sinner conuert, repent and lyue.
And vnto wicked Ierusalem sayth our sauiour
Christ: O Ierusalem, Ierusalem,
which slayest the Prophetes, and stonest
them that are sent vnto thée: Howe ofte
would I haue gathered together thy chyldren,
as the Hen gathereth her Chickins
vnder her wings, and thou wouldest not.
Loe, thy house therefore is left desolate.
Mat. 23. Loe, héere appeareth the goodnesse
of the lyuing Lord, so dillygently callyng
the wicked to him by his worde, by his
Prophetes, by his messengers, and at the
length by his owne sonne, that he can not
in any case be accoumpted the Aucthor of
theyr euyl, nor cause of theyr fal. But contrary
wise, theyr owne wylfull and wycked
stubbernesse is the cause of their euyl,
and the onely occasion of theyr fall, as it is
written: Thy perdition and destruction is
of thine owne selfe, but onely of me is thy
saluation. And infinite scriptures to the
same purpose appertayning. That wée
may saye with Daniel: vnto thée O Lord,

belongeth ryghteousnesse, and to vs the
shame and couering of our faces. Daniel. 9.
Secondly, The testimony of the consciences
of the wycked, which shall accuse or
excuse them at the great day
                  •
                which is alwayes
of the force and valure of a thousande
wytnesses, which is the worme that
shall neuer dye, but gnawe the wycked
for euer. Esai. 46. This conscience, I say,
of theyrs shall condempne the wycked,
and what shall God then doo? Or wherein
is his dreadfull maiestie to bée charged?
Caine by his owne conscience, is compelled
to confesse: greater is my wickednesse
then can be r
                  ••
               ytted. Thou castest mée
from the face of the earth, sayth hée, and I
must hyde mée from thy face. Loe, the iust
iudgement of God, and his worthy condempnation,
openly confessed. Who dare
then blame God? Caine dare in no wyse
doo it. Neyther yet prowde Pharao, who
condempned in his owne harte and conscience,
accuseth him selfe and his people,
and iusti
                  •
               yeth God, delyuering all men
from this wicked blasphemy, saying, openlye:
I haue sinned nowe, the Lord is iust,

and I and my people are wycked. Exo. 9.
What doeth Iudas? Doeth hee not crye
lykewyse, I haue synned, betraying this
innocent blood. Math. 27. And to vtter in
d
                  ••
               de that thing he felt within his br
                  •
               ast,
he is compelled to take aduengaunce, and
execute a iudgement moste terryble against
him selfe, vttering to all the world
him selfe most wicked, and that the iustice
of God, punishing suche wycked Traytours
and murtherers, ought most worthily
to bée feared, magnifyed, and re
               
                  •
               erenced,
throughout the whole worlde.
Lyke as all the other wycked and desperate
persons, which for anguishe of harte,
and terrour of conscience, doo murther
themseluos, doth euidently and continually
witnesse vnto the worldes ende, that
there is a iust Lorde, the God of iudgement,
whome they doo feare, and before
whose face they dare not appeare to accuse
him of any sinne, but rather taking
the crime blame, shame, and punishment,
vnto them selues, who worthily by theyr
owne conscience, haue deserued it, doeth
thus torment themselues, and with violent

hande
                  •
                aduenge the sinne they haue
commytted in theyr owne synfull soule
                  •
               
and bodyes. Thus must God alwayes
bée founde iust, and ouercome when he is
iudged, by the testimony of our owne
conscience, which shall accuse or excuse
vs at the great daye. Roma 2. Wherefore
let no man be so foolyshe to saye, that God
is the Author of euyll, vnlesse he wyll bée
accompted worse than Cain, more proude
than Pharao, more wycked than Iudas,
or any other the Reprobate from the begynning
                  ••
               
            
            Thirdly, the nature of sinne being de
               
                  •
               yned
by the authorytie of Scriptures, to
bée a thought, worde, or deede, contrary to
the wyl of God. For such things onely defyle
the man, as Christ our master sayth,
Math. 15. And therefore are onely to bée
accompted sinne. No such thought can bée
attrybuted or ascrybed vnto God, as can
be against his wyll, therefore no sinne
can bée his worke. Neyther can he bée
the Aucthour of euyll, which therefore
is called God, because he is the Aucthour
and geuer of all good, and so farre from

euyll, that he turneth all our euyll to some
good, our sinne to the vttering of his grace,
our lyes to the declaration of his trueth.
No, this is the perfit workemaster which
worketh all things without fault or trespasse,
all other doo fayle, faul
                  •
               e, & 
                  ••
               espasse
and sinne in al their workes, that he may
be iustifyed in all his dooings, and al creatures
fal down before his face & presence.
Who though he doo worke al in al things,
yet doth he worke the same to such godlye
ende and purpose, knowne onely to his
maiestie, that though we be compelled to
say, God is the author of the fa
                  •
               t, yet must
we answere: but not of the cryme. Because
he is the Maister of the house, and
Lorde ouer the family, and therefore may
doo any thing without the blame of his
seruaunts.
            And lyke as that which is no faulte in
the maister of the house, is a great faulte
many tymes in any of his seruaunts, because
it is the breaking of theyr maisters
commaundement: Euen so doubtlesse the
selfe same worke is sinne in God his seruaunts
and creatures, which to God is no

               
                  ••
               nne, but an ordinary worke appoynted

                  •
               or some speciall purpose, eyther for the
manifestation of his power, as was the
hardeninge of Pharao, or for the declaration
of his mercye, as was the fall of
Dauid, of Peter, of Marie Magdalen, and
all other repentant sinners. And where
               
                  •
               ore,
I pray you, may not this Lorde thus
vse his owne seruauntes, without any
blame of sinne, seeing that hée hath created
and made them all onely to serue
hys glorye, hys iustice, and hys mercye.
Or howe can hee bee vniuste, or the authour
of anye synne, by whome all the
worlde muste bee iudged and broughte to
the balance of iustice and equitye. When
the first worlde shall be condemned for
their sinne and iniquitye, and wée nowe
lyuinge shall bee iudged for 
                  •
               ure sinnes:
specially all those whiche not onely doe
euyll them selues, but are Authors and

                  •
               aultors to wicked doers. Romaines. 1.
            
            Fourthly, The maiestie of God can bée
subiect to no sinne, bicause it can be vnder
no lawe. And that onely is worthely
called sinne whiche is done agaynst

a Lawe, therefore no worke that God
dothe oughte to be accompted euyll, eyther
that he is the occasion of any euyll,
whiche onely is the minde, sence, spirite,
and power of the Lawe, wythout
whome no lawe of it selfe is good. For euerie
good lawe is the minde, wyll, and commaundement
of God, and what so euer
lawe is not the mynde, wyll, and commaundement
of God (as was the lawes
of the Scribes and Phariseys, and of the
cursed Papists) the same be wicked: who
of necessitie were set vp the body of Antichrist,
to vtter theyr vnrighteousnesse,
that Christe the sonne of righteousnesse,
the head of his body, in his manyfolde
mercies, more playnely might appeare,
and shine with more glory. Agayne to define
sinne to be the affection, motion, or
operation of any reasonable creature, agaynst
the lawe of God: his maiestie must
needes be secluded and excused, who is the
lawe maker, the creator, no creature, hauing
no euill motion, nor ledde with any
affection, whiche mighte make his worke
euyll. Like as the creature is for the most

part blame worthie because euen when it
doth the best of all. It is subiect to some
affection, eyther selfeloue, or hatred of
some other, yea the Lorde God maye vse
any of his creatures in any worke, without
the blame of any euill, as well as the
Smith may make his coles to flame, or to
quenche them, eyther the same peece of
yron, sometimes his hammer, sometime
his tongs or stithy.
            Wherefore though very muche might
be sayde in this parte, that as the potter
may make of one peece of clay what hym
liketh, the Smith mays make of hys yron
diuers instrumentes, yet following the
godly wisdome of S. Paule
                     •
                  
                I thinke it
more meete to beate downe mans subtilties,
with the contemplation of the Maiestie
of the mightie God, pronouncing
boldly that suche as saye (if my lyes and
sinne set foorth his glory, why am I then
iudged as a sinner, let vs doo euyll that
good may come, and so in their wycked
words dare make God the author of euyl)
hath their worthy damnation alreadye,
as Paule sayth. Rom. 3. For of necessitye

whiche their eyes can not sée, suche diuersitie
of sinne and grace, of righteousness
                  •
               
and vnrighteousnesse, of the contrarietie
and chaunge of things, must be in this wō
               derfull
creation of heauen and earth, by
the high maiestie of God appoynted and
ordeyned. For what needed the goodly
creature of lyghte? If there had bene no
darknesse, or howe shoulde this benefite
haue bene felt or perceyued? what matter
or cause of vttering iustice mighte haue
bene found without sinne and vnrighteousnesse?
how should grace haue bene shewed,
if no wrath had bene deserued? No
the mightie God thereby most euidently
vttereth his maiestie, in that he sheweth
how the heauens fal into darknesse without
him, the earth into dust, the Angels
into deuyls, the men into sinne, and so finally
without him all thinges to come to
nought, that he might be magnified, creating
all things, his sonne our sauiour renowmed,
who hath redéemed vs all, hys
holy spirite exalted, who hath renewed all
vs that be his elect and chosen. Nowe to
what creature is the maiestie of God

bounde and founde debter of his spirite.
If he withholde it from any, his dreadfull
maiestie may rightly withhold it, for who
hath giuen him first, to aske any thinge agayne
of debt or dutie? If his maiestie doo
giue his spirite, it is of his free mercy and
grace. If the earth fal into dust, if man fal
into sinne, that all things may be knowne
to be nothing without God: what blame
deserueth God, or who dare accuse hym?
No, let all flesh fall downe before his maiestie
and confesse: All thinges doth onely

and the shame shall fall vpon our own faces.

The second cause which concerneth
man (wherby many mistake this doctrin)
is that God exhorteth man alwayes in his
Scriptures to good, and forbiddeth euyll
with many terrible threatnings, whiche
things seemeth not to be needful (say they)
seeing the Ele
                  ••
               e shall be saued, & the Reprobate
condēned, by decree & sentence giuen
vpon them before they be borne. To
this we do answere, that these exhortatiōs
and cōmunications are very necessary to
both twaine, bicause God leadeth vs men
alwayes like reasonable creatures, not
like insensible ste
                  •
               ks or stones. And to the
Elect they are most necessarie prickes and
spurres, to stirre the dull flesh toward his
dutie, as all good men feeleth & can beare
witnesse. To the Reprobate they are testimonies
of the good wyll of the almighty
God to them opened and vttered, but openly
resisted, and refused, and reiected, accordinge
to the saying of oure Sauioure
Christ: If I had not come and spoken to
them, they had had no sinne, but nowe
they haue no pretence or excuse for theyr
sinne. Paraduenture you wyll answere

mée: They can not obey vnto it. What
is the cause thereof I pray you? bicause
they lacke the spirite of Christe to leade
them, you wyll say: I dare easily graunt
you, but wyll they graunt this? wyll they
(thinke you) submite them selues vnder
poore Christe, and the foolyshnesse of the
crosse, and not rather boast and brag their
wisedome, their knowledge, and their vpright
dealyng, and righteousnesse. Are not
these the men that dare thus boast? Wée
knowe as well as the Preacher can tell
vs. Is the spirite of God departed from
vs to speake with him? As was sayde to
Micha. 2. of the Kings. 22. chapter. Or as
the Pharisies did answere vnto Christe:
are we blynde? To whome our Sauiour
sayth agayne: If you were blinde you had
no sinne, but nowe you say you see, therefore
your sinne remayneth. Ioh. 9. Thus
doubtlesse they are so farre from the submission
& subiection to poore Christ, that
contrariwise they doo willingly and naturally
followe their Father Lucifer, who
did lift him selfe arrogantly aboue Christ
the sonne of righteousnesse, and euermore

fyghteth against Christ, though the mightie
power and high wisedome of God turneth
his euyll wyll and all theyrs to his
glory & good purposes. None other wayes
than bodily and naturall darknesse, which
by the wonderfull wisdome of God, clearly
setteth forth the bright Sunshyne, and
yet laboureth by continuall course to shadowe
the Sunne, and to couer the whole
earth. Wherefore the Lord God to driu
                  •
               
away this naturall darknesse from man,
exhorteth to iustice and equitie, which is
his nature, and the Image which man
ought to counterfayte. And alwayes commaundeth
thinges therevnto agréeable.
And forbyddeth that hee is not, that is to
s
                  •
               ye, iniquitie, and dehorteth therefrom
by his Prophetes and Preachers, publyshing
his wyll and pleasure, which is the
lyght and lawe most perfecte to man his
noble creature, whome he hath made for
his honour and glory, whome he hath appointed
to beare his Image vpon earth, of
iustice, righteousnesse & innocency. But
because this Image could by no creature
perfectlye bée expressed, vnlesse the same

were fully replenished with the self same
Godhead, because that all things besidesfoorth
had some imperfection, bewraying
theyr originall the darknesse, as Iohn calleth
it, the Tohu and Bohu, as Moyses
doeth it name. The vaine vanitie, and
wylde deformitie, whence they were by
creation altered, recouered, and brought
into lyght and lyfe, as appeared in Adam
fallyng from trueth to lyes, straight at the
begynning: nowe of necessitie the sonne
of God (who onely is good of nature) becommeth
man, and taketh this office to
beare the Image of God inuisible. Colo. 1.
And to be the head of that spyrituall perfection
which was to be wrought in mankinde,
by his aforeappointed purpose, and
becommeth the fyrst begotten of all creatures,
for by him were all thinges created
both in heauen and earth, visible and inuisible,
maiestie, Lordshyp, rule, & power,
by whome, and in whome all things are
created, and hée is before all creatures,
and in him all thinges haue their beeing.
And he is the head of the bodie, he is the
begynning and first begotten of the head,

that in all things he might haue preheminēce.
For it pleased the father that in him
should dwell al fulnesse, and by him to reconcyle
all thinges to himselfe. And to set
at peace by him through the blood of his
crosse, both things in heauen and things in
earth: for euen you, sayth Paule, which
in tymes paste were straungers, because
your minds were set in euyl works, hath
he now reconcyled in the body of his flesh
through death, to make you holye and
blamelesse, and without fault in his sight.
Seeing then that this cannot be denied to
be the course of God his holy working, to
dryue away this darknesse, and to bring
man to his lyght, to take away sinne, & to
bring man to a lyfe blamelesse, the state
of innocencie
                  •
                and his owne likenesse: shal
it not bee most necessarye to haue Preachers
& Teachers, to tell vs the same, and
to admonishe vs wherevnto we be called,
seeing of our selues and our owne reasons
no such thing can be perceyued? Therefore
haue we preachings & exhortations,
as Paule sayth: for when the worlde thorowe
wisdome knew not God in the wisdome

of God, it pleased God through the
foolyshnesse of Preaching, to saue them
that beleeued. 1. Corin. 1. And as hee also
sayth of him selfe in another place: Wée
doo Preach this ryches in Christ the hope
of your glory, warning all men, and teaching
all men in all wisedome, to make all
men perfyte in Christ Iesu.
            Thus serueth then exhortations, dehortations,
comminations, and publycations
of the lawes and wyll of our Lorde
God: that hee maye bee knowne the Lord
and gouernour ouer all the thynges hée
hath created, and the onely lawe maker
amongst his creatures, publyshing vnto
all that perfecte equitie and iustice, which
ought in no case to be resysted. Whervnto
if they can not attayne, they must confesse
and knowledge their owne infirmity
and weakenesse, and submyt them selnes
vnder the mightie hande of God, and so
dooing they shall be receyued as chyldren
of the most louing and most mercyfull father,
in suche degrées of perfection as hee
hath appoynted to the beautifying of the
bodie of his sonne our head. So that the

Lorde God doeth teache all, and lyghten
all men that come into the worlde, bothe
chosen and Reprobate, with such a knowledge
as doth the good Prince, which vnto
all his Subiects proclaimeth his statutes,
and publysheth his lawes: but lyke a good
and tender father, he leadeth his children,
regenerate and borne a newe, neyther of
fleshe nor blood, nor the wyll of man, and
guydeth them with his fatherly spyrite,
in the pathes of the same lawes, wryting
in theyr hartes what is his good wyll and
pleasure.
            In the which course of God his wonderfull
worke, the wicked hath no cause to
complayne, for as theyr father whom they
doo followe, is named the Prince of this
world, so they haue the world at wyll, and
are riche roysters and welthy worldlings,
tramplyng vnder theyr feete, poore Abel,
and the despysed Christians: neyther wyl
they change their estate with any such, no
when they are called from darknesse to be
partakers of light, of life, and the heauenly
daynties, layde vp in poore Christ, they
despised that estate, excusing their purchases,

theyr marchaundice, and their earthly
lustes and delyghtes. Luke. 14. Wherfore
in the other worlde they that héere are

                  •
               ppressed shall haue comfort, and the other
forment.
            Such is the order then of God his working,
that by the contrarietie of the chosen
and reprobate, of Iacob and Esau, of Pharao
and Israel, and the wisedome of God,
and the wisedome of the world, he wyl set
for
                  •
               h his maiestie, his power, his diuinity
                  •
               
his Godhead, so much as may be knowne
vnto man (that is to say) in his wisdome,
iustice, mercy, & almightynesse. For, comparing
his wisedome to any other wisedome,
nowe appeareth the contrarie, that
it is very foolishnesse, euen darknesse compared
vnto lyght, death vnto lyfe, lyes vnto
trueth, as Paule sayth: When they
accoumpted themselues wyse, they were
made very fooles, and chaunged the trueth
with lyes: the glory of the immortal God,
to mortall & corruptyble creatures. They
following their owne righteousnesse could
not come to the ryghteousnesse of God in
Iesu Christ.
            
               Wherefore of necessitye God dyd shut
all vnder synne, that his mercie myght
flow ouer all. And that his mighty power
myght appeare, hée hath created the heauens
and earth, wherein we doo see lyght
and darknesse, death and lyfe, shame and
glorye, weaknesse and strength, lyes and
trueth, ryghteousnesse and vnryghteousnesse,
to serue to the settying foorth of his
glorie, that man may bée dryuen to saye
with Paule: O the depth of the ryches of
the wisdome and knowledge of God. How
incomprehensyble are his wayes? Howe
vnsearchable are his iudgemēts? For who
hath knowne the minde of the Lorde? Or
who hath bene his coūseller. Or who hath
giuen him ought aforehand, that he might
bée repayed? For by him, and through
him, and in him, are all things, to him bee
prayse for euer. Amen.
            And as this holy Apostle Paule doeth
submytte him selfe to the great depth of
the wysdome of God, and his wonderfull
Regiment and prouidence, and woulde

                  •
               eate and dryue downe all fleshe by the
consideration of the same. So also all our

Fathers from the begynning hath layde
this the onely foundation of theyr fayth:
Wherefore Moyses beginneth to stablish
the fayth of man at the historie of the creation,
and so foorth by the order of God
his present gouernaunce about the things
made and created. And Dauid for a
confession of his fayth, pronounceth of
this prouidence. Psalm. 95. I doo knowe
that thou art a great Lord, and a Lord aboue
all Gods. All thinges whatsoeuer
the Lordes pleasure was, hée hath made
in the Heauens, the earth, the Seas, and
the bottomlesse waters. Againe, by the
worde of God all things were set in their
places, and by the spyrite of his mouth all
the powers that be in them. And Paule
consydering m
                  •
               st déepely, and pronouncinge
moste playnlye this diuine gouernaunce
of the creatures, and godly prouidence
of the creatour, in all things for his
Electe and chosen, sayth thus. Roma. 8.
Wée knowe that all thinges worke for
the best vnto them that loue God, who
also are called of purpose: for those which
he knewe before, he also predestinate, that

they should be like fashioned to the shape
of hys Sonne. Moreouer, whome he hath
predestinate, those hath he called, & whome
he called, thē he also hath iustified, whome
hee hath instifyed, those also hath hee glorifyed.
            So that thys appeareth to be no newe
learning or vaine doctrine of Gods prouidence
and Election. But the only ground
of fayth and certainty of conscience in al
conflictes agaynst the worlde, the fleshe
and the deuil, agaynst Sinne, Death, and
Hell, as the Apostle vseth it in the latter
end of the same chapter, and all the Fathers
from the beginning hath felt it. For
how coulde Adam by any other worke or
creature, eyther by comfort of any other
doctrine, stay hys conscience? But in that
the Lorde God promised to prouyde for
hym, and to saue him from his enemye
(who once had ouercome hym) by the blessed
seed, which not by merites, but by mercie
and grace, and therfore of his frée purpose
before appoynted, shoulde bée sente
vnto hym, to breake the headde of the
Serpent: Why? Should Abraham haue

lefte hys countrey and his owne Father
                  •
               
house, if he had not felt this diuine prouidence:
fatherly care, frée choyse, and Election
of him and his s
                  •
               de? By the whiche
liuely feling of God his careful prouidēce,
and frée choyse, sending him seede when he
was past hope of seede (cōcerning his dead
bodye all the workes of nature) and by
the stedfastnes of faith in the temptations
about the same 
                  •
               éede, to be made a slayne
sacrifice, other gréeuous temptations and
aduersities from time to time layde vpon
hym, this chosen vessell Abraham is called
the father of all faythful. As by his hystorie
appereth a fatherly care of our God,
for all his people, both for bodies & soules
for wife and childe, and all togither. And
Isack his sonne, that chosen seed, in whom
all the Nations of the earth were promised
to be blessed longe before the chylde
was borne, hath this promise of enheritaunce
gyuen hym by fauour, that the
promise mighte be sure to all the séede as
Paule sayth Rom. 14. vnto whome and his
faythful seede, this frée promise & fatherly
Election and Predestination (or what else

you wyll call it) was againe reuealed and
opened Genes 26. In these wordes: thorowe
thy seede shall all the nations of the
earth be blessed. And the liuely sence and
feelyng of this Election and fatherly care
of God for him, did then especially shine in
his hart, when the Lord said vnto him: Go
not into Egipt, 
                  •
               arie heere, I wyll be with

                  •
               hée, and wyl blesse thee, & thorow thy seede
shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
Ge. 26. And after that greeuous temptation
vndoubtedly wherein he was compelled
for feare of the Philistines, to denye
his wife and call her sister, & after the manifolde
contentions with the Philistines,
wherin his God dyd preserue him, and at
the ende, in the wonderfull myracle of
his chyldren, whose byrthright was altered
by the vnsearcheable prouidence of
God, the manyfest notes and tokens of
the free Election and choyce of God dyd
appeare. And Iacob chosen and beloued
in his mothers wombe, felte thys
free worke of God his great fauour, who
had chosen hym before h
                  •
               e was borne,
and takynge occasion of the necessitie of

his brother, seeketh the byrthright, the
which God had vnto him before appoynted
and promysed, renouncing the course
of nature, then doth hée leaue and forsake
his fathers house, and paciently taketh all
troubles offred vnto him. In the which often
tymes vndoubtedly he féeleth the heauy
and gréeuous temptations that his fathers
Abraham and Isaac had before (for
no creature more often suffereth trouble
than the very Elect of God) for the experyment
of his fayth, whereby the lyuely
sence and vndoubted tokens of his fauourable
election after many battels and victories,
might be made certaine & sure, thorough
present comfort alwayes ministred
vnto him, eyther by secrete inspiration or
manifest reuelation, witnessing the singular
care of his heauenly Father ouer him
his dearely beloued and chosen chylde, as
his wonderful vision of the ladder and the
Angels descending from heauen doth declare,
and the other vision wherein the
Angell dyd shewe him the partie coloured
sheepe for his portion, to multiplie and encrease
his substaunce: as also when God

biddeth him goe into his owne countreye

               eytfull Laban, and defendeth

his heart and conscience the assured signe

               Ieremye also chosen in his Mothers
wombe, as appeareth in the first chapter
of his Prophecie, where it is sayd from the
mouth of God: before I fashioned thée in
thy Mothers wombe I did know thee, and
or euer thou wast borne I did sanctifie thée
and ordeyned thee to be a Prophet vnto
this people, then felte the moste lyuely
signes and t
                  •
               kens of his Election, when
his 
                  •
               leshe repined, grudged and feared to
take in hande the execution of this greate

                  •
               ngerous embassage, & the power
of God his spirite dothe touche his heart,
and openeth his mouthe to the planting

and rooting vp of all people and kingdoms
to breake, destroy, and make waste, and
raysed hym as a fenced towne, a brasen
wall, and yron pyller agaynst the kinges,
priestes, and people of the lande. Nowe
though sometymes hys flesh doth grudge
for the burthen, of his offyce, and anguishe
of hart, as though he had beene an abiecte
or Reprobate, yet alwayes after the
brunt of temptations vttering his weaknesse,
he findeth the mercyfull prouidence
of his heauenly father, to take a continuall
care of hym, and not onely comforte
and assist hym, but also most euidently to
punish his enimies.
            And to be short, all the electe of God are
thus chosen and called, guided, and gouerned
from their mothers wombe, according
to the sayinge of the princely Prophete:
Thou arte hée that takeste mée from my
Mothers wombe, thou wast my hope,
yet when I hanged vppon my Mothers
brestes. I haue bene left vnto thée euer
since I was borne, thou art my God euen
from my Mothers wombe. And then doe
they féele most sensibly & liuely this theyr

Election, when temptations and aduersities
doth a
                  •
               aile and assault them, in the
which conflicts of the flesh, and the spirite,
of sinne and grace, of lighte and darknes,
they are compelled to crye and call, to sigh
and sobbe before theyr heauenly Father
for the deliueraunce of this mortall and
sinful booy subdued to vanitie: and though
they do most euidently perceyue how they
are called from darknesse to lighte, from
loue of iniquitie, to the hatred of the same,
from obedience somtime giuen to Sathan
and to the lustes of the flesh, to the obedience
of the spirit, whiche fighteth against
the flesh, and though, I say, they perceyuing
this, be not able to quench these raging
lustes yet do they mourne and dayly
lament, calling for the grace of their heauenly
father, which lamentations, sighings
and sorowyngs of theyr sinnes, bée
the sensible féelings and liuely signes and
tokens of Gods infallible and sure Election.
Wherefore whosoeuer shal féele these
secret sighes and mournings, thereby hating

                  ••
               nne & desiring therfrō to be delyuered,
considering theyr owne weaknes, and

by the fruite, and a good man forth of the
good treasure of his harte doth bring foorth
good workes, & the euyll man euyl works.
This doth Iames byd vs, to shewe our
fayth of our workes, and sayth, that Abraham
did thus vtter his faith by his works,
and Rahab by her workes, and were iustifyed.
Where we are compelled with all
the godly learned to expounde the worde
iustifyed, declared to bée iust, or else we
doo make Iames contrary to him selfe, contrary
to Moyses, whose sentence he in the
same place alledgeth, contrarie to Paule,
and the whole course of Scriptures. And
thus muste all the generall sentence of
woorkes bée vnderstoode, that by these
woorkes wherein God wyll haue vs to
walke, we are knowne to haue his spirite
to be good trees, & so iudged by our fruites:
as is the good Apple tree by the Apples,
not that the Apples make hym good, but
testifye that hee is good, and that it hath
within it selfe a kindly power of good iui
                  ••
               
and norishment. So we féeling the power
of the spyryte workinge in our hartes.
Godlye motions, and so brynging forth

good fruites of fayth and good workes, doo
cōfirme our Election and vocation, as Peter
speaketh, to our selues and others.
            The seconde vse of workes is, that God
in vs by them may be gloryfied. Whereof
our sauiour Christ sayth, Mat. 5. Let your
lyght so shine before men, that they séeing
your good works, may glorifie your father
which is in heauen. And this is the chiefe
vse of good workes, the laude and glorye
of God, where vnto wée were fyrst created
in the earthy Adam, & now are a new
restored by the heauenly Adam, Christ
Iesu, to walke in good works, & to be holy,
blamelesse and without fault. And to this
ende, that God in them might bee gloryfied,
doth scripture commend vnto vs good
works, & setteth forth the crowne of glory
to them that therin are exercised. So rūne
that ye may obtaine, sayth the Apostle, labor
for the crowne incorruptible. 1. Cor. 9.
            
            Nowe because these latter dayes are
the tymes wherein our Sauiour Christ
dyd saye, that 
                  •
               ayth should fayle, and charytie
shoulde ware colde, we that haue so
cleare reuelation of Gods great mercyes

wishing alwaies to be of more perfection,
let them with all thankes geeuinge vnto
God reioyce, knowing that this procedeth
not from flesh nor bloud, but frō the spirite
of our head Iesus Christ, who maketh intercession
for his afflicted members (who
are his Sainctes) with vnspeakeable gronings.
Whome though for a time hee doo
permit to be afflicted, both in spirite and
bodie, as sometimes he did Iob, Ionas,
Ieremie, and other: yet at the ende hee
giueth vnto them most triumphant victorie,
accordinge to the euerlasting purpose
of his diuine prouidence, who is to be feared,
reuerenced, renowmed and praysed
for euer. So be it.
            Heretofore haue we answered generally
to them that woulde make God the
Author of euyll, and to them which do say,
that this doctrine taketh away exhortations
and threatninges, and the preachyng
of the worde. Nowe by the grace of God,
we wyl more briefly answere to some arguments
whiche they bryng foorthe of the
scriptures, setting aparte all such cauyllations
as mans reason (whiche in Gods

mysteries can neuer bée satisfyed) by the
craft of the deuyl doth excogitate, & inuēt.
But first we wyl speake somthing of good
workes, & the true vnderstanding of those

of mans power against this doctrine
of grace & free Election, which dare

of theyr saluation, the which (as we haue

Christ Iesu before the foundation of the
world was lay

of adoption, & the feeling of Gods mercies
in electing, calling & iustifying, fyrst of all
haue this vse, y• they declare the power of
God to bee in vs, and the spyrite of Christ,
which doth conforme vs to his image: and
this is the ende whervnto we are Elected
and Predestinate to be conformed to the
Image of his sonne. Rom. 8. Elected before

the foundation of the world, to be holy and
blamelesse. Eph. 1. Created vnto good workes,
which God hath prepared for vs to
walke therein. Eph. 2. These haue the reward,
as Paul sayth, not onely of this lyfe,
but of the world to come. Therefore sayth
our Sauiour Christ. Math. 25. Come ye
blessed of my father, possesse the kingdome
prepared for you from the begynning of
the world. I was hungry, and ye gaue me
meate: I was thyrstie, and ye gaue me
drinke. &c.
            Of this excellent commendation and
rewarde of good workes, we do learne the
dignity of the same, not of the worthinesse
of thēselues, which are neuer able to stand
in Gods iudgementes: for our very righteousnesses
are, as Esay sayth, as clothes
fylthily polluted, but of the dignitie of the
grace of the promise of God, who worketh
them in vs. For it is God, sayth Paul, that
worketh in vs both the wyll and also the
worke, euen of his purpose. Phi. 2. Therefore
all is of grace, not of works, least any
should glory. Ephes. 2. For if there were
any power in our selues, or dignity in the

workes, then had we some thing to glory,
but now that all is confessed to be of Gods
free mercies, and nothing of our selues, we
conclude that God crowneth and rewardeth
his owne workes in vs, that who so
gloryeth should glory in the Lord. 1. Cor. 1.

so to commende workes that they shoulde
bee the cause of the Election and the fauor
of God, they doo not consyder the fyrst
wordes: Come you blessed of my Father,
inheryte the kingdome prepared for you
from the beginning of the world. Wherin
we may note, that they beeing the blessed
and beloued of the father, are called to the
inheritance of the heauenly kingdom, not
wonne by works, but prepared by the heauenly
Father for his children, before they
dyd any works at all: Lyke as the wicked
haue theyr place of eternal torment, there
named for them before, prepared and appoynted.
And in both twayne the workes
both only declare what the trées are where
out they spring, and testifie what the fountaine
is whence they flowe: according as
                  •
               
our sauiour Christ saith: the trée is known

in Iesus Christ maye geue no occasion to
the slouthfull fleshe, eyther in our selues
or others: but after the example of the
Scriptures, we must alwayes exhort to
good workes, and so tame our bodyes and
bring them into subiection (as Paul sayth)
least whyles we preach to others, we our
selues be founde Reprobates. 1. Corin. 9.
The which sentence is euil aledged of the
aduersaries of Election, as though Paule
myght haue become a Reprobate, or as if
that he had not bene certaine of his saluation,
but that it shoulde hang of his well
dooings. For he saith first in the same sentence,
I do so rūne, not as at an vncertain
thing, and so fyght, not as one that beateth
the ayre: but as he sayth to the Romaines.
chap. 8. I am sure that neyther death nor
lyfe, neyther Angels, nor rule, neyther
power, neyther thinges present, neyther
things to come, neither high, neither low,
neither any other creature, shalbe able to
depart vs from the loue of God in Christ
Iesu our Lorde. Lykewise they alledge
foorth of the seconde Chapter to the Phillippians,
that Paule wylleth vs to work
                  •
               
               
our owne saluation: but they doo not consider
that he streight wayes addeth, that
it is God whiche worketh bothe the wyll
and the worke. And in the chapter before,
he saith, that it is God which hath begon y•
good work, and wyll finish it. So that such
Scriptures maye neuer bee alledged for
workes agaynste grace, for 
                  •
               o set vp our
saluation of our selues, which onely commeth
of mercy in the free Election, wherby
we were chosen in Christe Iesu, and
created a newe in him, by his onely spirite
to bring foorth good workes. Therefore
doo we conclude with Paule. Romaines. 11.
that wée are saued and iustified freelye
by grace, not by workes, for so grace
were no grace, and that all are shutte vp
vnder synne, that mercye may be vppon
all, vppon whome it pleasethe hym to
shewe mercye. And for the consideration
of these greate mysteryes of Election
and Reprobation, we crye wyth Paule:
