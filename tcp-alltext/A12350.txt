SERMON,
Vpon part of the 5. Chapter
of the firſt Epiſtle of Saint
Paule to the Theſſalonians.
            By Henry Smith,
Which Sermon being taken by Characterie,
is now publiſhed for
the benefite of the
Faithfull
            AT LONDON,
Printed for the widdowe
Broome. 1591.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               1 Theſſ. 5, 19, 20. 21. 22.
               19. Quench not the Spirite. 20. Deſpiſe
not Prophecying. 21. Trie all
things, and keepe that which is good.
22. Abſtaine from all apparance of
euill.
            
            HAuing lately ſpoken of theſe
wordes; In all thinges giue
thankes, and quench not the
Spirite: Touching the firſt,
I ſhewed you, that it is an eaſier
thing to obtaine of God, than to bee
thankfull to him; for moe haue gone
away ſpeeders,Luke 17, 17. than haue gone away
thankers. Then howe the wicked are
beholding to God aſwell as the iuſt,
and therefore it is ſaide, that the ſunne
dooth ſhine vppon the iuſt and vniuſt.
Then howe Iaacob came not ſo bare
to Laban,Gen 19, 30. (when he brought nothing
with him but his ſtaffe in his hande)
as man commeth into this worlde,

without ſtrenght or ſtaffe to ſuſtain
him, which made the Apoſtle to
aske:1 Cor 4, 7. 
               What haue you which you haue
not receiued? Therefore, to teach
man to bee thankefull vnto his Maker,
he was not made in Paradiſe, the
place of ioye and happineſſe; but being
made out of Paradiſe, hee was
brought into Paradiſe,
               Gen 2, 8. to ſhew how
all his ioy and happineſſe came from
God, and not from Nature, that hee
might knowe where to beſtowe hys
thankes. Therfore Dauid to perſwad
all men vnto thankfulneſſe, ſaith: It
is a good thing and pleaſant to be thankfull.
               Pſal 147, 1.
If hee had ſaide, no more but
good, all which loue goodneſſe were
bounde to be thankfull, but when he
ſaith not onely good, but pleaſant too,
all which loue pleaſure are bounde
to bee thankefull: and therefore, as
Peters Mother in lawe,Math 8, ſo ſoone as
Chriſt had healed her of a feuer, roſe
vp immediatly to miniſter vnto him:
So we ſo ſoone as Chriſt hath doone
any thing for vs, ſhoulde riſe vp immediatly

to ſerue him.1 Sam 1. As Annah
when ſhe had receiued a ſonne from
God, did conſecrate him to God againe:
ſo what ſoeuer we receiue of
God, we muſt giue it to God againe;
that is, vſe it to his glory, and make it
one of our meanes to ſerue him, for
all things which wee receiue in this
life, are giuen vnto vs, leaſt we ſhould
want any meanes to ſerue God.
            Then becauſe the Apoſtle requireth
thankes for all thinges, I ſhewed
you, that hee is not thankfull before
God, which thanks him only for his
benefites, but hee is thankefull in
deede, which thankes him for his
chaſtiſement. It may bee while the
Lord giueth, many will ſay: Bleſſed be
the name of the Lord: but when the
Lord taketh away,Iob 1▪
                who will ſay bleſſed
be the name of the Lorde. There is
one example thē of Paules doctrine,
which is: in all things to giue thankes.
There is an other example of Paules
doctrine, which gaue thankes to
GOD for his rodde: for an obedient

childe dooth not onely kiſſe the
hand which giueth, but the rod that
beateth.
            After, ſpeaking of theſe wordes,
Quench not the Spirite; I ſhewed you
that the Spirite, doth ſignifie the gifts
of the Spirite: the Spirite in the third
of Mathewe,Math 3, is likened to fire, and
therefore Paule ſaieth well, Quench
not the Spirite, becauſe fire may bee
quenched.
            Heere I tooke occaſion to ſpeake
of zeale, which is the fire of the Spirite;
ſhewing you that GOD is pleaſed
with zeale, as men are pleaſed
with loue. But as Chriſt did baptiſe
with fire;
               Math 3, 11. ſo Iohn did baptiſe with
water: And, as the holie Ghoſt deſcended
with fire; ſo hee did deſcend
with a winde that cooleth fire:
               Acts 2, ſhewing,
that our zeale ſhould bee a temperate
zeale,
               Eſay 58, 2, as our Maſters was. Eſaiah
was commaunded to crye, but
not to roare. The Iewes might not
gather too much Manna,
               Exo 16, 18. no more
than they might gather too little: as

there is a meaſure in knowledge, ſo
there is a meaſure in zeale; that is, be
zealous according to diſcretion, as
Paule ſaith,Rom 12, 3. 
               Bee wiſe according to ſobrietie.
The Diſciples were commended
for their zeale,
               Math 10, 28. when they
left all to followe Chriſt: but Chriſt
reprooued them for their zeale,
when they woulde pray for fire fromLuke 9, 55.
heauen to conſume the Samaritanes.
Therefore zeale and diſcreation vnited
togeather, are like the two Lyons
which ſupported the throne of Salomon;1 Reg 10, 20.
and hee which hath them
both, is like Moiſes for his mildnes,
and like Phineas for his feruencie:
therefore, as wine is tempered
with water, ſo let diſcretion temper
zeale. But I neede not bring water, to
quenche that fire which is out already;
I would rather I could ſay of you,
you are too zealous, as Paule tolde
the Athenians they were too ſuperſtitious.
               Acts 17. 22.
But our ſickneſſe is not a hot
ſickneſſe, but a colde ſickneſſe; the
hotte bodie is diſtempered, but the

colde bodie is dead.
            Then I ſhewed you, howe the Spirite
is quenched, as a man dooth
quench his reaſon with ouer much
wine: and therefore wee ſaye, when
the wine is in, the wit is out; becauſe
before hee ſeemes to haue reaſon,
and nowe hee ſeemes to haue none:
So our zeale, and our Faith, and our
loue, are quenched with ſinne. Euerie
vaine thought, and euery idle
worde, and euerie wicked deede, is
like ſo many droppes to quench the
Spirite of GOD. Some quench it
with the buſineſſe of this worlde:
ſome quench it with the luſtes of the
fleſh: Some quench it with the cares
of the minde: Some quench it with
long delaies: that is, not plying the
motion when it commeth, but croſſing
the good thought with badde
thoughtes, and doing a thing when
the Spirite ſaith doe it not: as Acbab
went to battaile after hee had conſulted
with the Prophet: therefore
Paule ſaith;Eph 4, 30. 
               Grieue not the Spirite:
               
ſhewwing that the Spirite is often
grieued before it be quenched, and
this is principaly to bee remembred
that when a man beginnes to grieue
and checke, and perſecute the Spirite,
lightly hee neuer ceaſeth vntill
hee hath quenched it; that is, vntill
he ſeeme to haue no ſpirite at all, but
walketh like a lumpe of fleſh.
            After Quench not the Spirite, followeth
Deſpiſe not Prophecying: In
the ende of this Epiſtle, Paule ſpeaketh
like a Father which is come to
the ende of his life, who becauſe hee
hath but a while to ſpeake, heapeth
his leſſons together, which he would
haue his ſonnes remember when hee
is gone: ſo Paule, as though he were
ſet to giue good counſaile, and had
no leyſure to ſpeake that he woulde,
ſendeth the Theſſalonians a briefe of
his minde, which their meditation
ſhould after amplifie and expounde
vnto them: His firſt aduiſe is, quench
not the Spirite: that is, when a
good motion commeth, welcome it

like a friende, and croſſe it not with
thy luſtes: for luſtes are enemies to
the benefite of the Soule.
            The ſecond Admonition teacheth
how the firſt ſhould be kept, Despiſe
not prophecying, and the Spirite will
not quench, becauſe prophecying dooth
kindle it.
            The thirde Admonition teacheth
howe to make fruite of the ſecond,
Try the doctrines of them which prophecie,
& thou ſhalt not beleeue errour
for trueth, but holde the beſt.
            The fourth Admonition is the
ſumme of all, and it commeth laſt, becauſe
it is longeſt in learning; that is,
Abſtaine from all apparance of euill.
This is the ſumme of al, for he which
can abſtaine not onely from euill, but
from the apparance of euill, is ſo perfect
a man, as can bee found in this ſinfull
life.
            Place all theſe together, and it is
as if Paule ſhould ſay, Quench not
the Spirite by despiſing of Prophecying,
neither despiſe Prophecying, becauſe all

doe not Prophecie alike; but rather
when you heare ſome preach one
way, and ſome an other; when you
ſee ſome follow him, and others followe
him, doe you trye the doctrines
by the Scripturs,Acts 17, 11. as the men of Beroea
did, and chooſe that which is
beſt, and ſoundeſt, and trueſt, hauing
alwaies ſuch an eye to the Trueth,
that you abſtaine from all apparance of
errour; ſo iealous the Holy Ghoſt
would haue vs of our faith, that wee
ſet no Article vpon our Religion, but
that which is an vndoubted truth; as
Moyſes did nothing in the Tabernacle,
but that which was ſhewed in the
patterne ſet downe before him.
            The occaſion of theſe Leſſons,
ſeemes to come of this; that there
were ſome among the Theſſalonians
as there bee among vs, which did forſake
all Religion, becauſe the Preachers
did not agree, or becauſe the
liues of Profeſſors gaue ſome offence,
therefore Paule ſheweth that
there is no cauſe, why they ſhoulde

miſlike the Word for the Preacher;
or why they ſhoulde deſpiſe Religion
for the Profeſſour, becauſe the Word
& the Religion is not theirs: for they
can no more bee polluted by them
than God. Then he concludeth, that
feeing it is neceſſarie, that there ſhall
be alwaies errours and hereſies, to
trye vs; we ſhould alſo trye them, and
thereby bee prouoked ſo much the
more from errour or hereſie, that we
abſtaine euen from the appearance
thereof, leaſt wee fall into the ſinne;
this is the ſcope of theſe wordes.
            
               Despiſe not Prophecying. This Admonition
is (as it were) the keeper of
the former: for by prophecying the
ſpirite is kindled, and without prophecying,
the ſpirite is quenched; and
therefore after Quench not the ſpirite,
Paule ſayth, Deſpiſe not Prophecying:
ſhewing, that as our ſin dooth quench
the ſpirite, ſo Prophecying doth kindle
it. This you may ſee in the Diſciples
that went to Emaus: of whome it is
ſayde, when Chriſt preached vnto

them out of the Lawe and Prophets,
their Spirite was ſo kindled with his
prophecying,
               Luk 24, 32, 
               that theier heartes waxed
hot within them.
            
            This you may ſee againe in Saules
Meſſengers, which were ſent for
Dauid,1 Sam 19, 20. when they came among the
Prophets, and hearde them prophecie,
their Spirite was ſo kindled, that
they coulde not chooſe but prophecie
alſo: in ſo much, that when Saule
came after himſelfe, and hearing
the Prophets, as they did, the Spirite
came vpon him likewiſe, and hee
prophecied too, where-vpon it was
ſaid:1 Sam 19, 23. 24. 
               Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?
This is no maruell that the Spirite of
man ſhoulde bee ſo kindled, and reuiued,
and refreſhed with the word,
for the word is called the foode of the
ſoule:
               Heb 5. take away the worde from the
ſoule, and it hath no foode to eate,
as if you ſhould take foode from the
bodie, the bodie woulde pine: And
therefore Salomon ſaith, without viſions
the people perriſh:
               Prou 29▪ 18. that is, without

out Prophecying the people famiſh.
Therfore, he which loueth his ſoule,
had not neede to despiſe Prophecying,
for if hee deſpiſe Prophecying, then verily
he famiſheth his owne Soule, and
is guiltie of her death.
            The Apoſtle might haue ſaid, Loue
Prophecying, or honour Prophecying:
But why dooth he forbid, to deſpiſe
Prophecying? Why did Chriſt ſay,
The poore receiue the Goſpell,
               Mat 11, 5. but to
ſhewe that the rich did contemne it?
Why dooth Paule ſay, I am not aſhamed
of the Gospell,
               Rom 1, 16. but to ſhewe that
manie are aſhamed of it? Euen ſo he
ſaith, deſpiſe not Prophecying
               ▪ ſhewing,
that the greateſt honour we giue
to Prophets, is not to deſpiſe them:
and the greateſt loue which we carrie
to the Worde, is not to loath it. If
wee doe not deſpiſe the Preachers,
then we thinke that we honor them
enough; and if we doe not loath the
Worde, then we thinke that we loue
it enough: therefore the Apoſtle
ſaith, Deſpiſe not Prophecying, for honour

Prophecying.
            
            
               Prophecying heere dooth ſignifie
Preaching,Rom 1▪ 14. as it dooth in Rom 1, 14.
Will you knowe why Preaching is
called Prophecying? To adde more
honour and renowne to the Preachers
of the Word; to make you receiue
them like Prophets, and then
Chriſt ſaith,Mat 10, 41. you ſhall haue a Prophets
rewarde: that is, not ſuch a reward
as you giue, but ſuch a rewarde
as God giueth.
            Laſtly, if you marke, Paule ſayth
not Deſpiſe not Prophets, but Prophecying;
ſignifying, that from the contempt
of the Prophets, at laſt wee
come to deſpiſe Prophecying too, lyke
the Iewes, when they were offended
with the Prophet, charged him to
prophecie no more.
               Iere 11, 21. Therfore as Chriſt
warned his Diſciples, to heare the
Scribes and Phariſies,Mat 23, 3. although they
did not as they taught, ſo Paule warneth
the Theſſalonians, that if any
Prophets among them, do not as they
teach, and therefore ſeeme worthie

to bee deſpiſed like the Scribes and
Phariſes: yet that they take heede,
that they doe not deſpiſe Prophecying,
for the Prophets.
            Becauſe the Preachers are deſpiſed,
before the worde bee deſpiſed;
therefore we will ſpeake firſt of their
contempt. Chriſt asked his Diſciples
what they thought of him?
               Mat 16, 13. So I
woulde aske you, what you thinke of
Preachers? Is he a contemptible perſon,
which bringeth the Embaſſage
of God?2 Cor 5, 20, which hath the name of an
Angell,Reu 1 20, and all his wordes are Meſſengers
of life? is he a contemptible
perſon? Prophets are of ſuch account
with GOD, that it is ſayde:
God will doe nothing,
               Amos 7, 3. 
               before hee reueale
it vnto his Prophets: ſo Prophets are
as it were GODS Counſellers. Againe,
Kinges, Prieſtes, and Prophets,
were figures of Chriſt: all theſe
three were annointed with Oyle,1 Kings 13, 1, to
ſhewe that they had greater graces
than the reſt, but ſpecially the Prophets
are called men of God, to ſhewe

that all which are of God, will make
much of Prophets for Gods ſake:
therefore,1 Cor 14, 34. women are forbidden to
take vppon them to prophecie, leaſt
that noble calling ſhoulde become
vile and deſpiſed, by ſuch vnskilfull
handlers of it. Therefore when the
Prophet Eliſha, would ſend for Naaman
the leaper, to come vnto him,
theſe were his words:2 King 5, 8. Naaman ſhall
knowe that there is a Prophet in Iſraell:
as though all the glorie of Iſraell
were chiefely in this, that they had
Prophets and other had none. Therfore,
when this Prophet was dead,
Ioaſh the King came vnto his corſe,
and wept ouer his face, and cryed:
O my Father,
               1 King 13, 14. 
               my Father, the Charet of
Iſraell and horſemen of the ſame: ſhewing,
that the Chariots and horſes, and
Souldiours doe not ſo ſafegard a Cittie,
as the Prophets which teach it,
and pray for it. Howe ioyfull and
glad was Lydea, when ſhee coulde
drawe Paule and Silas to her houſe:
If you thinke me to be faithfull come to
               Acts 16. 15.
               
               my houſe: ſhewing, that neuer any
gueſts were ſo welcome to her houſe
before. Howe tender was the Shunamite
ouer Eliſha, that ſhee built an
houſe to welcome him, and to keepe
him with her, thinkes all the places
in her houſe too bad for him, ſhee
built him a newe roome, and made
him ſtay.
            Howe much did the Galathians
make of Paule,Gal 4, 1
                     •
                  . that hee ſaith, They
woulde pull out their owne eyes to doe
him good; So, once a Prophet was eſteemed
like a Prophet, and hath
hee bidde you deſpiſe them nowe,
which bad you to honour them before?
No, Paule chargeth vs to receiue
our teachers, as hee was receiued
himſelfe: ſaying, Hee which laboureth
in the Word is worthy of double
honour:
               1 Tim 5, 14. That is, the preachers (after
a ſort) are as well to be honoured as
the Ruler.
            Aaron and Moyſes were brethren.
If Aarons Vrim and Thumi woulde
haue ſerued:Exo 28, 30. Moyſes rod and ſtaffe

ſhould not haue needed. But when
the tongue could not perſwade, then
the rodde did compell.
            As Paule ſheweth the Theſſalonians,
howe the Preachers of the
word ſhould be honoured, ſo he teacheth
the Phillippians how to honor
their teachers,Phil 2, 29. ſaying: Receiue him in
the Lord with great gladnes, and make
much of ſuch: that is, ſhew your ſelues
ſo glad of him, that hee may be glad of
you. Haue you neede to be taught,
why Paule woulde haue you make
much of ſuch? becauſe they are like
Lampes, which conſume themſelues
to giue light to other: ſo they conſume
themſelues to giue light to
you; Becauſe they are like a Henne,
which clocketh her chickens together
from the Kite: ſo, they clocke
you together from the Serpent; Becauſe
they are like the Shout,
               Ioſ
                     •
                   6, 20. which
did beate downe the walles of Iericho:
ſo they beate downe the walles
of ſinne; Becauſe they are like the
fiery Piller which went before the

Iſraelits to the lande of Promiſe, for
they goe before you to the lande of
promiſe;
               Exo 13, 20. becauſe they are like Moiſes,
which ſtept betweene the plague
and the people, becauſe they are like
good Andrewe, that ſhewed his bretheren
the Meſſias,
               Iohn 1. 14, ſo they call you to
ſee the Meſſias, and therefore make
much of ſuch. If wee ſhoulde make
much of Prophets, how much ſhould
we make of prophecying? If we ſhould
loue our inſtructers, howe much
ſhould we loue inſtruction?
            Simeon keeping in the Temple
met with Chriſt,Luke 2, 28. ſo, many hearing the
Worde haue met with knowledge;
haue met with comfort; haue mette
with peace; haue met with ſaluation;
but without the Word neuer any
was conuerted to God: therefore,
whenſoeuer the word is preached, euery
one may ſay to himſelfe, as the
Diſciples ſaide to the blinde man;
Be of good comfort,
               Mar 10, 49. 
               he calleth thee: Be
of good comfort the Lorde calleth
thee; But when the word is not preached,

thē euery man may ſay to himſelfe,
Beware the deuill calleth thee.
When the Prophets went from Ieruſalem,
then ſworde, and famine, and
peſtilence, and all the plagues of
God rayned vpon them, euen as the
fire came vppon Sodome,Gen 19. ſo ſoone as
Lot was gone out.
            There be two trades in this lande,
without which the Realme can not
ſtand; and one is the Queenes ſouldiours,
and the other is the Lordes
ſouldiours, and the Lordes ſouldiers
are hardly vſed, like the Queenes
ſouldiers; for from the Marchant to
the Porter, no calling is ſo deſpiſed,
ſo contemned, ſo deryded, that they
may beg for their ſeruice: for their
liuing is turned to an almes; one
ſaith, Moyſes is quis: that is, the Magiſtrate
is ſome bodie: but Aaron is
quaſi quis: that is, the Miniſter is no
bodie, becauſe no bodie is deſpiſed
like him. Receiue a Prophet in the
name of a Prophet, nay, receiue a
Prophet in the name of an enemie,

as Achab receiued Eliah, Art thou
heere myne enemie?
               1 King 21, 20. If Paule had liued
in our dayes, he would not haue
ſaide, Deſpiſe not the Prophets, but
perſecute not the Prophets: for hee
ſhoulde haue ſeene, not onely deſpiſers
of the Prophets, but mockers of
them; not onely mockers, but ſlaunderers
of them; not only ſlaunderers,
but hunters, biters, and ſmiters of
them. Charme the Charmer neuer ſo
ſweetly, let his ſong be neuer ſo pleaſant,
yet many Adders are readie to
ſtoppe their eares, and to ſtoppe his
mouth; like a Birde which is ſmitten
in her ſong, of the Archer whom ſhe
ſingeth vnto; euen as Saule let his
ſpeare flye at Dauid,1 S
                     •
                  m 19, 10 while he played
vppon his harpe to ſolace and comfort,
and driue the euill ſpirite from
him. Once they did builde houſes for
the Prophets like the Shunamite,2 Kin 4, 10. but
nowe they take their houſes from
them, and thinke they doe God good
ſeruice, when they make them, and
their Wiues, and their Children, and

their Seruants beggars. Once Paule
ſaide to Timothie,1 Tim 4, 12. 
               Let no man despiſe
thy youth: ſhewing, that Preachers
ſhoulde not bee deſpiſed for their
youth; but nowe they deſpiſe the
younge Prophets and the olde too,
with great contempt.
            Howe is the double honour turned
to ſingle honor? Nay, how is our honour
turned to diſhonour?Mal 1, 3. 
               If I bee a
Maſter (ſaith God) where is my feare?
ſo, if we be Prophets, where is our reuerence?
Dooth not the contempt of
Prophets crye vnto God, as well as
the blood of Abell.
               Gen 4, 10.
            
            When the Meſſengers which were
ſent vnto the Vineyeard for fruites,
were beaten of them which ſhoulde
haue laden them; then it is ſaid, that
the Lorde of the Vineyarde waxed
worth,
               Mat 21, 43. 
               and ſaide, that hee woulde let the
Vineyarde vnto others, which ſhoulde
yeelde vnto him the fruites thereof.
            
            The meaning of this Parable is
this, that when the Preachers and
Teachers which Chriſt ſendeth to

his Church for fruits, are abuſed and
perſecuted, or contemned and ſcorned,
by thoſe whom they (by him appointed)
doe call vnto the heauenly
banquet; then will hee remooue the
glorie of their Light, and the ſweete
comfort of his Goſpel to others, which
will yeelde him the fruites thereof.
Theerfore what may thoſe feare
which haue vſed Chriſts Ambaſſadours,
as Ammon vſed Dauids Ambaſſadours.2 Chro 10, 4.
Ieruſalem is left without
one Prophet, becauſe ſhee deſpiſed
them. Sodom was burned becauſe
ſhe diſpiſed Lot: & the whole world
was drowned becauſe it deſpiſed
Noah. And are not theſe examples
written for our warning.
            The time came when Saul ſought
for a Prophet,1 Sam 28. and GOD woulde
not aunſwere him by Prophets, becauſe
hee had deſpiſed his Prophets
before: ſo, the time commeth, when
you ſhall aske, Wheere is the Seer? and
they ſhall ſay, he is rapt away like Elias;
a Prophet was amongſt vs, but

when hee was deſpiſed in Ieruſalem,2 Kings 2, 2, 11.
he was ſent to Niniuie, Is not iudgement
begun already? dooth not the
Goſpell ſtande at the doore, as if
ſhee were ready to take her leaue:
are wee not come from deſpiſing of
Prophets, almoſt to the deſpiſing of
prophecying too? Doe not many walle
in the ſtreetes, while wee preach in
the Temple.
            The beaſtes came to the Arke toGen 7. 9.
ſaue themſelues, and men will not
come to the Church to ſaue themſelues.
But we maye crye vnto them
as the Children did vnto their fellowes
in the Market: Wee haue pyped
vnto you,
               Mat 11, 17. 
               and you woulde not daunce,
Wee haue lamented vnto you, and you
would not mourn. Some come to heare
vs, but they come as Naaman came
to Eliſha,2 Kings 5, 11. when the Prophet had
tolde him what hee ſhoulde doe, hee
mocked him for it, and thought that
hee knewe a better way than that
himſelfe. So they come to heare vs,
but they thinke they can teach vs.

But they muſt remember that Paule
ſayth:1 Cor 1, 27. 
               GOD hath choſen the fooliſh to
confound the wiſe. Therefore, if they
thinke themſelues wiſe, let them
thinke vs thoſe fooles whome God
hath choſen to confounde them. For
although at all other times we are as
plaine and ſimple as Iacob, yet at this
time we haue a promiſe, and it is giuen
vs for your ſake, to ſpeake ſometime
that which we conceiue not ourſelues,
becauſe the houre is come
when GOD hath appointed to call
ſome of you, as he hath done ſome of
you before: therefore as the Princely
ſpirite came vppon Saule when hee
ſhould reigne, to teach him howe he
ſhould rule; ſo the Propheticall ſpirite
commeth vpon Teachers, when
they ſhould teach, to teach thē how
they ſhould ſpeake: therfore Chriſt
was content to be baptiſed of Iohn, ſo
be you contented to bee inſtructed of
vs; that if wee bee more ſimple than
you, the glorie of God may appeare
more in conuerting you by vs.
            
               
Hath not this deſpiſing of the preachers,
made the Preachers almoſt deſpiſe
preaching? The peoples neglecting
of the Prophets, hath made the
prophets neglect prophecying. The diuell
ſtirres vp this careleſnes in mens
hearts, to the intent our ingratitude
may moue the Lord to take from vs
(as from the Iewes) both our Prophets
and our prophecying, & ſo leaue vs to
a ſenceleſſe ſecuritie, that moſt commonly
fore-runneth deſtruction.
            VVhat mooueth ſo manie that
wold put their hands to the plough,
and ſtudie diuinitie, looke backe to
lawe, or Phiſicke, or trades, or anie
other thing, rather then they will enter
into this contemptible calling,
but onelie the conſideration of our
contempt and beggarie? And is not
the Arke then readie to depart from
Iſraell? Nowe if you will knowe,
what makes Prophets and Prophecying
deſpiſed, more fully, you may ſee
firſt in Ieroboams prieſts,1 King 15. 26. it is ſaid that
Jeroboam made Iſraell to ſinne, that is,

               Jeroboam made Iſraell to contemne
Religion, becauſe hee made Prieſtes of
the baſeſt of the people:
               1 King 13, 33. therefore, they
which make Prieſtes like Ieroboams
Prieſtes, make the people contemne
the Prieſts and Religion too.
            Why might none carrie the Arke
of the couenant but the Leuits?Deut 10, 8. was
it not, leaſt the Arke, which is a ſigne
of God, ſhould bee despiſed? therefore,
none ſhoulde meddle with the
Word, which is, the Lawe of God, but
they which are fit, leaſt they make it
deſpiſed.
            The ſecond thing which makes
Prophets and Prophecying despiſed, is,
the rudenes and negligence of them,
which are able to doe well in theyr
Miniſtrie, and yet doe contrarie.
It is ſaide of Hophni and Phineas,
               1 Sam 2, 17. that
by theyr corrupt ſacryficing, they
made the people abhorre the ſacrifices:
ſo, many by their ſlubbering of
the Word, (for want of ſtudie & meditation)
doe make men thinke that
there is no more wiſedome in the

Worde of GOD, than they ſhewe
out of it. There is a kinde of Preachers
riſen vp but of late, which ſhroud
and couer, euerie ruſticall, and vnſauerie,
and childiſh, and abſurde Sermon,
vnder the name of the ſimple
kinde of teaching, like thee Papiſts
Prieſtes, which make Ignoraunce the
Mother of Deuotion: but in deede to
preach ſimply, is not to preach rudely,
nor vnlearnedly, nor confuſedly;
but to preach plainely, and perſpicuouſly,
that the ſimplyeſt that dooth
hear, may vnderſtand what is taught,
as if hee did heare his name. But if
you will knowe what makes many
Preachers, preach ſo barely, and looſly,
and ſimply? It is your owne ſimplicitie
which makes them thinke,
that if they go on, and ſay ſomething,
all is one, and no fault will be founde,
becauſe you are not to iudge in nor
out: and ſo, becauſe wee giue no
attendaunce to doctrine as Paule
teacheth vs.Math 4. Yea, it is almoſt come to
paſſe, that in a whole Sermon, the

hearer cannot picke out one note
more, than he could gather himſelfe:
In the 48. of Ieremie, there is a curſe
vpon them which doe the buſines of
the Lorde negligently: truely I cannot
tel whom the Prophet meaneth.
Theſe would not haue Prophets and
prophecying deſpiſed, and yet they
are meanes to make both deſpiſed
themſelues.
            The laſt thing which makes Prophets
& prophecying deſpiſed, is the
diuerſitie of minds, while one holds
one way, and an other an other way,
ſome leaue all and will bee of no Religion,
vntill both parties agree; as if
a patient ſhould pine himſelfe & eat
no meate at all, becauſe one Phiſitian
ſaith, that this meate will hurt him,
and an other ſayth, that that meate
wil hurt him: theſe are thē the three
enemies which makes vs and our labours
ſo vulgarly deſpiſed.
            Nowe what ſhall wee aunſwere to
our Deſpiſers?
               Mica 7. 
               Reioyce not againſt mee,
O my enemie (ſayth the Church) for I

ſhall be praiſed: ſo, Deſpiſe not the Prophets,
O ye Iſmalites, for they ſhall
be honoured.
            Peter ſaith to Ananiah and Saphira;
You haue not lyed vnto man,
               Acts 5, 3. 
               but
vnto GOD: for you haue not despiſed
man, but GOD. For our Sauiour
Chriſt ſaith,Luk 10, 16. 
               Hee which deſpiſeth you,
deſpiſeth mee: and hee which deſpiſeth
me, deſpiſeth him that ſent mee.
            
            When ſathan ſlew Iobs ſeruants,Iob 1, 16. his
malice was againſt Iob: ſo, when you
deſpiſe GODS ſeruants, your preſumption
is againſt God; for that
which you doe vnto them (ſaith Chriſt)
you doe vnto mee. VVhy then, if
they deſpiſe Chriſt? they ſhall bee
deſpiſed of Chriſt: for he tolde Saul,
that hee ſpurned againſt the pricke▪
               
that is, he ſpurned againſt that, which
woulde ſpurne againſt him. Therefore,
if you giue vnto Chriſt whenMath 10,
you giue vnto the poore; And if you
honour Chriſt when you honour his
Prophets: us you giue vnto the
poore for Chriſtes ſake, ſo deſpiſe

not the Prophets for Chriſtes ſake: if
for all this we muſt bee deſpiſed ſtill,
then this is our remedie, Paule ſayth:
Whatſoeuer wee are to you,
               2 Cor 2, 15. 
               yet we are a
ſweet ſauour to God, both in them which
are ſaued, and in them which perriſh.
That is, though wee bring him word
that you will come to the banquet,
yet wee ſhall bee welcome without
you, and ſo much of that.
            After Despiſe not Prophecying, followeth,
T
                     •
                  rie all things: as if he ſhould
ſay; Despiſe not Prophecying, leaſt you
beleeue error for truth: for, as among
Rulers there be bad rulers, ſo among
Prophets, there be falſe Prophets,
This made Chriſt warne his Diſciples,
to beware of the leauen of the
Phariſies,Mar 8, 25. that is, of their falſe doctrine.
This made Iohn ſay, Trie
the Spirites;
               1 Iohn 4, 1. and therefore wee reade
in the 17. of the Acts, howe the men
of Beroea woulde not receiue Paules
doctrine before they had tried it,Acts 17, 11, and
how did they trye it? It is ſayde that
they Searched the Scripture: that is, the

way which Paul would teach you to
trye other, euen as he was tryed himſelfe:
wherby you may ſee, that if you
vſe to reade the Scriptures, you ſhall
bee able to trie all doctrines, for the
word of GOD is the touchſtone of euery
thing,Gen 1, 2. like the Light which God
made to illuminate all his creatures,
ſo is the Scripture to decide all queſtions;
euery doubt muſt come to the
worde, and all controuerſies muſt be
ended at this tribunall: the Scripture
muſt ſpeake, which is right, and
which is wrong: which is truth, and
which is error: and all tongues muſt
keepe ſilence to heare it. So GOD
hath appointed that the iudge of
our controuerſies, which he ſaith in
the 12. of Iohn,Iohn 12. 48▪
                
               ſhall iudge vs in the laſt
day.
            
            Heere a man may aske, if it be ſo,
that God would haue vs trye all our
Religion by the Scripture, and not
by Fathers, nor by Doctors, nor by
Counſels, nor by Angell, nor by
Pope: how then doe the Papiſts ſay,

we muſt beleeue as the Church beleeueth,
and neuer looke into the
Scripture whether our teachers ſaye
as God ſaith, but take it vpon theyr
credite, as a blinde man eateth his
meate: a man tryeth his horſe which
muſt beare him, and ſhall he not trye
his faith which muſt ſaue him?
            Peter ſaith: Let euerie one bee able
to giue a reaſon of his faith. Is this a
reaſon to ſaye, I beleeue ſo, becauſe
Rome beleeueth ſo; or rather becauſe
the Worde of GOD dooth
teach me ſo? It will not bee an auailable
aunſwere for them which dye
in hereſie, ſuperſtition, or blindneſſe,
to ſaye, the Prieſtes taught vs ſo: no
more than it ſerued the firſt woman
Eue to ſaye,Gen 3, 13. the Serpent taught her
ſo: for GOD ſaith, Bee not deceiued,
neither by Serpent, nor by Prophet,
nor by Angell: Therefore I
conclude with the Apoſtle Paule,
Despiſe not Prophecying, leaſt the
Goſpell bee taken away from you;
and yet trie Prophecying, leaſt you receiue

errour for trueth, and mens
dreames for doctrine.
            As wee are to trye doctrines, ſo
Paule woulde haue vs to trie our
thoughts, and ſpeeches, and our actions:
therefore hee ſayth, Trye all
thinges. Hee dooth not bid vs take a
taſte of all ſinnes and vanities, as Salomon
did, to trye them, for they are
tryed alreadie: but that we ſhoulde
ſet the Worde of GOD alway before
vs like a rule, and beleeue nothing
but that alone which it teacheth,
loue nothing but that which it
preſcribeth, hate nothing but that
which it forbiddeth, and doe nothing
but that which it commaundeth:
and then wee Trie all thinges by the
Worde of GOD. As the Eunuch
ſayde,Acts 8. 31. 
               Howe ſhoulde I vnderſtande
without an Interpreter? ſo thou maiſt
ſay, howe ſhall I trie without the
Worde, which is, the touchſtone of good
and euill.
            
            Nowe, when wee haue tryed by
the Worde of God, which is trueth,

and which is errour: which is light,
and which is darknes: what ſhoulde
we doe then? Keepe that which is beſt:
That is, ſtay at the trueth, ſtay at the
light, as the wiſe men that followed
the conduction of the bright ſhining
ſtarre from the Eaſt,Math 2. ſtayed when
they came to Chriſt.
            We muſt keepe and holde faſt
the trueth, euen as a man gripeth a
thing ſtrongly with both his hands:
that is, defend it with thy tongue:
maintaine it with thy purſe: further
it with thy labour, in daunger, and
trouble, and loſſe, and diſpleaſure:
come life, come death; think alwaies,
as Chriſt did ſeale the trueth of his
promiſe with his blood moſt precious,
ſo thou muſt ſeale the trueth of
thy profeſſiō with thy deereſt blood;
elſe is it apparant thou dooſt not
keepe it but let it goe. Well therfore
dooth Paul put trye before chooſe; for
he which in choiſe of all things firſt
tryeth, may after his tryall chooſe the
beſt. But hee which chooſeth before

he trye, takes oftentimes the worſt
ſooner than he dooth the beſt.
            And in this was exceedingly manifeſted
the notable deceit of ſathan
by his inſtrumēts the popiſh Prieſts
in the dayes of ignorance; who, becauſe
the people ſhould take ſuperſtition
before Religion, would neuer
let them haue the touchſtone of the
Word to trye their doctrines, but kept
them from the Scripture, and lockt
it vp from their vnderſtanding, in an
vnknowne tongue, which they could
not skill of, leaſt they ſhoulde trye
their teaching,Acts 17, as the men of Beroea
tryed the wholſome doctrine of S.
Paule: and by their ſleights making
all their Religion a craft, as men call
their trades; for in no deceiuable
trade (howe full of falſhood ſoeuer)
could more deceit be harboured than
in theirs. Therefore as Ioſiah reioyced
in his time, that the booke of GOD
was ſound againe: ſo we may reioyce
in theſe dayes, that the booke of God
is found againe; for when the people

might not read it nor heare it, it was
all one to them, as if they had (for ſo
long time) vtterly loſt it.
            After this precept of the Apoſtle,
Trye all things and keepe the beſt: hee
addeth: Abſtaine from all appearance
of euill: as if hee ſhoulde ſay, that is
like to bee beſt, which is ſo farre
deuided from euill, that it hath not
ſo much as the appearance of euill:
and that is like to bee trueth, which
is ſo farre from errour, that it hath
not the ſhewe of errour: whereby
hee ſheweth, that nothing ſhould
bee brought into the Church, or added
in matters of faith and doctrine
to our Religion, but that which is
agreeable and conſonant to the vndoubted
trueth, and vtterly without
ſuſpicion of errour. It is not inough
to bee perſwaded of our faith, but
wee muſt be aſſured of it; for our
Religion is not built vppon wauering
and inconſtant doubtes, but vppon
moſt aſſured & certaine knowledge.
            
               
Heere we may maruaile why Paul
biddeth vs, Abſtaine from all appearance
of euill, becauſe it is apparant,
that ſinne, and hereſie, and ſuperſtition,
are hypocrites: and common
experience approoueth, that ſinne
hath the appearance of vertue, & hereſie
hath the appearance of Trueth,
& Superſtition hath the appearance
of Religion: but let our wonder
heerein be thus aunſwered. By this,
the Apoſtle dooth note, that there is
no ſinne, nor hereſie, nor ſuperſtition,
but if the viſour or vaile bee remooued,
or rather taken away from
it, which maketh it ſeeme vertue, or
trueth, or Religion, it will appeare
in the right nature to be a ſinne, and
hereſie, and ſuperſtition, though at
the firſt ſight, the maske or viſour
doe make it ſeeme none: becauſe it
couers the euill, like a painted Sepulcher
vpon rotten bones.
            Heereby we are taught, prudently
to iudge of all thinges as they are,
and not as in outward appearance

they ſeeme to bee; and as wee drawe
aſide the curtaine, before we beholde
the picture: ſo we muſt remooue (to
auoyde our owne preiudice) all opinions
and ſurmiſes, and then behold
the thing naked as it is, if wee determine
to knowe it indeede: for trueth
needes no collours to make it glorious.
            Heere I might admoniſh them
which ſeperate themſelues from our
Church, in ſuch manner as S. Paule
admoniſheth all men, when he ſaith:
Examine whether you be in the faith;
ſo, examine whether you haue the
ſhewe of errour. Hath it not the
ſhewe of errour, to broach a Religion
which was neuer hearde of before
theſe late yeeres?
            Hath it not the ſhewe of errour,
to retaine an errour, which the Author
himſelfe hath voluntarily recanted;
euen as yee would ſucke vp
with greedines the dogs vomite?
            Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
affirme that thoſe Preachers may in

no wiſe be hearde, which (by their
owne confeſſions) haue firſt conuerted
and painfully brought them to
the knowledge of God, and daylie
conuerteth others.
            Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
affirme, that the Lordes Prayer may
not bee vſed as a lawfull Prayer:
which for the excellencie of Chriſtian
peticion, and without any controuerſie
(for any thing that wee or
they can read) was ſo vſed from the
beginning?
            Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
ſay, that no man may vſe any ſet praier,
ſeing there be many Prayers, and
Pſalmes, and bleſſings, and thankeſgiuings
in the Scripture, which were
vſed in that fourme.
            Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
affirme, that wee haue no Church,
and yet to graunt that our Martyrs
which dyed in the bloody perſecution
of tyrannous poperie, were true
members of the Catholike Church?
            Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to

affirme, that two or three may excommunicate
all the reſt without a
Miniſterie, ſeeing the Paſtor is the
mouth of the Church?
            Hath it not the ſhewe of errour,
to affirme, that the Church of Chriſt
was neuer inuiſible before this age,
and that it is ſuch a ſmall flocke, as
their number is: and that it hath ſet
foote no where but in England?
            Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
holde that for ſound and good Religion,
which is altered euerie day; adding
and detracting, as though a man
ſhould make a Religion of his owne
inuentions, changing and altering ſo
faſt as newe conceits come into his
idle braine?
            Let them thinke that Paule ſaith
vnto them:Rom 12, 3, 
               Be wiſe vnto ſobrietie,
and ſuſpect that conſtruction which
your ſelues deuiſed: for Salomon
ſaith,Pro, 4, 27. 
               There is an errour vppon the
right hande as well as vpon the left,
that is, as I may call it: The zealous
errour. And if this be not that errour

of zeale, I knowe none at all in this
lande.
            Yet ſhall not I ſay, that wee haue
not the ſhewe of euill too? Naye, I
would that we were but in the ſhewe
thereof. I may not call euill good, no
more than I may call good euill, and
therefore let vs pull the Beame out
of our owne eyes, as we woulde pull
out the moate out of other mens. Let
vs amend our ſinnes, and then boldly
reprooue others.
            If Paule woulde haue vs abſtaine
from euerie appearance of euill, ſure
he would haue vs abſtaine frome hereſie
and hypocriſie. and not to ſurfet
with the bleſſings of peace, and
then ſaye: it was neuer merry world
ſince this newe Religion came vp;
not to pretende conſcience in not
comming to Church, and haue no
conſcience in oppreſſing the poore,
and vndooing the Fatherleſſe and
widdowes.
            Antechriſt and all his ſhauelings,
(thankes bee to GOD) are meetly

well rooted out from amongſt vs, yet
his taile (I feare me) remaines behind
in the hearts of a number, which liuing
amongſt vs like men of another
Nation,Num. 33, 55, are an ill ſauour vnto vs, as
the remnant of the Cananites were
vnto the Iewes. GOD charged his
people of Iſraell, to roote out all the
inhabitants of Canaan; yet they
ſpared ſome, as Saul (diſobaying the
voice of the Prophet) ſpared Agag,
but that remnant hindered their
peace, and neuer ſuffered them to
be in quiet; for they were goades in
their ſides, & prickes in their eyes: it
is with vs likewiſe to bee feared, that
the remnant of Canaan, which nowe
contemne Prophets, will be a meane
to pull downe Prophecying. But let
vs apply this doctrine of the Apoſtle
to the kindling of the Spirite in all
feruencie of zeale, and mildeneſſe of
loue: not deferring to imbrace grace
when it is offered, leaſt by delay the
Spirite bee quenched: and let vs reuerence
Prophets and Prophecying;
               
for deſpiſers, and mockers, may (in
their ſcoffings) mocke at Eliſha,2 Kings 2, 23, 24. but
the rewarde of their enuye, is a deuouring
ende. Neither let vs forſake
the Word, for any inuention of man,
but trie all things by the touchſtone
of the Scriptures, indeuoring to auoide
all occaſion of offence, and to
hold of that foundation which is beſt
and ſoundeſt, and not to be mooued:
Beſeeching him that hath taken the
euill of Antechriſtian errour and ſuperſtition
away, to take away alſo
the apparance of the ſame.
