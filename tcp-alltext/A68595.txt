of ſo godly a worke in Engliſhe. And alſo haue as it were a weapon in hande, to defend themſelues againſt the miniſters of Sathan, who be euer ready to cauyll againſt the trueth, more ready to putte men in doubt, then to eſtabliſhe them in the true Chriſtian faith. The true vnderſtāding of our beléefe is the pure gyft of God, and among his gifts the chiefeſt Beleefe with knowledge of Gods word, ordereth the minde, gouerneth the body, dyrecteth all our workes and affayres, teachinge what wée ought to doo, and what to leaue vndone, without whiche neither can King, Lord nor ſubiect, well order them ſelues, nor thoſe things that bée committed to theyr charge. Nowe if we eſteeme other things to be of valewe and can prayſe them: your honour knoweth that the knowledge of true beléefe grounded vpon Gods word, doth ſo farre excell all other things, as heauenly treaſures excell the commodityes of the earth. And this is moſte profitable to kinges, Dukes, Earles, and Lords, (as

appeareth in the 2. Pſalme, Deutero. 17 chap. and Eſay 46. chap. where they be named the nurces of religion) and vnto all other degrées ſpyrituall or temporal. And vaine are all men which know not this truely. And S. Paule ſayde becauſe it ſéemed not good to them to haue the knowledge of Gods word, he gaue them vp into a lewd mind, & to all vncleanes, For if God be the lyght, ſuche as knowe him not ſtumble in darknes. If he be the only way, the ignoraunt go ſtray. If he be the trueth, they that knowe him not be deceyued. If he be onely good, all good thinges muſt be borrowed and craued of him alone. If all knowledge & learning be his, wée muſt be Gods ſcholars. If he be life, not to knowe him his eternall death. For it is written, this is eternall lyfe, to know Ieſus Chriſt whome thou haſt ſent to be very god. But this knowledge muſte wée haue and learne in the ſcriptures, as S. Paule ſayth, the ſcripture is profytable to teach, to controll, to amende, and to inſtruct in all ryghteouſneſſe

that the offyce of ſaluation is lyttle regarded: But this myngle mangle of ſpirituall and temporall regiment, is vſurped by them, as if no Chriſtian Magiſtrat ordained of God, ſufficed to redreſſe ſuch abuſes. What maruell if mans ordynaunces be broken, where the ordynaunce of God is playnlye reſyſted. Alſo in the country where moſt nede of preaching and inſtruction is, there bée ydell chaplaynes, which poſſeſſe and withhold the Preachers liuings, and moſt ſpeciallye in the Cathedrall Churches: many of the which bée but onely a very refuge and denne of ydell, ignoraunt, and vnpreaching lubbers. Is not the ordinance of God, and good meaninges of noble founders broken here? Is not his proclamation diſobeyed, who proclaymed by the mouth of ſaint Paul, hée who laboureth not, ought not to eate? Among the Iewes temporall men, and thoſe that 
                  •
               erued not the Altar, were not ſuffered to liue of the altar, as they now do vnder the goſpel. Behold y• Apoſtles, Timothe

Tite, and many others. If we do alowe the order of the primatiue & holy apoſtolike church, let vs folow their examples. Beholde the fathers, as Origine, Ciprian, Ambroſe, Iherom, Auguſtine, Chriſoſtome, and others, who ſpent the greateſt part of their lyues in preaching and teachinge the people, as appeareth by their workes, which be for the moſt part Sermons, Leſſons, Homelies, diſputations, and confutations of hereſies in their tymes. They preached on the ſondayes and expoūded the ſcriptures. And on the wéeke dayes they procured theyr Sermons and expoſitions to be written. There were no pluralities of liuings in thoſe dayes, neither diſpenſations, Totquottes, nor Reſidences, qualifications, nor improperations. Chyldrē and boyes enioyed no Benefices in thoſe dayes by no manner of means, or conſiderations to come. God graunt vs ſhortly to ſée a redreſſe of ſpirituall abuſes, and temporall diſorders, in ſpyrituall gouernours without reſpect of priuate gaine. And y•

And that wicked Idolatrous murderers of Gods people, and diſobedient to his word and lawes, may be cut off, that Gods wrathe and indignation maye bee pacifyed by amendemente, accordynge to Goddes expreſſe woorde, Deuteromie thyrtéene Chapter: Thine eye ſhall not pyttye ſuche one, nor ſhewe mercye to him, but hee ſhall bée ſlayne. And ſo ſhalte thou take the euyll awaye foorth of the myddes of thee, ſayeth the Lorde God. (Reade the whole Chapter.) Alſo Saint Paule to the Hebrewes the tenth Chapter.

As dearth, warre, peſtilence, and other his ſcourges, as wée be threatened now of late by the punyſhmente of our neyghbours in Fraunce. Happy are thoſe that can bée admonyſhed by the fall of others, and amend. I would thinke my labour well beſtowed, if I mought obtayne of your honor, and other that be of a godly meaninge, to reade this ouer with good delyberation, and Iudgement: And alſo ſuche as be in doubte whiche is the true religion. And thoſe that thinke we be in

an errour, I would to God they woulde voucheſafe to reade and conferre it with the ſcriptures, and doctours, as is noted in the margine. And in reading, to put a ſyde diſdayne, contempte, and all ſingular and pryuate affections. And then I doubte not but God wyll open vnto them further knowledge, and mooue them to be more ſtudious in Gods word and alſo haue a better opinion of the true religion.
            I haue for my Countryes ſake tranſlated this godly and neceſſarye woorke, wherevnto I haue added nothyng of myne owne, but ſymple, and playnelye, according to my ſmall vnderſtanding, I haue kepte the wordes and meanyng of the authoritie, as neare as our Engliſh wyl ſuffer mée, rather ſhewing mee ſelfe homelye and playne, then by ouer muche fyneneſſe to diſſent from the mynde of hym, who in the feare of God, and for his Bretherns ſake ſet it foorth.
            Humblye beſéechynge youre honour,

and all godlye Readers, to take this my ſmall labour in good parte, and accept my good meaning, which tendeth to the profite of my Country men, and eſpeciallye to the glorie of God, and aduauncement of his kingdome.

               AMong the errours whiche raigne at thys daye in the worlde about faith and Chriſtiā religion, there be two which me thinketh bee as the ſprings & fountaines of al the others. The firſt is, that all which is done of a good intent is well done. The ſecond is, that thoſe which liue onely vpon the trafick or marchaundiſe of other mens ſoules, haue perſuaded the ſimple people that they neede not read y• ſcriptures, nor particularly enquire of euery poinct of that which they are bound to beleeue for to be ſaued. But that it is ſufficient to beléeue confuſedly and in a generalitie as the church of Rome beléeueth, and the reſt to cōmit to the Diuines or to the conſcience of his curate. Touching the firſt, it is

néedfull to defyne what intent is good & what euill. But to ſpeak after their owne maner, for as much as they beleue that all thoſe which think they do well haue a good entent▪ if it ſo were what woulde haue let ſainct P

               ing, ſeyng that he was an earneſt folower of the law of god giuen by Moiſes? And as for that he perſecuted the members of Ieſus chriſt, it was of ignoraunce, ſuppoſing to haue done god good ſeruice, as hee himſelfe wytneſſeth. Yet this notwithſtāding he ſaith he was a perſecutour and a Blaſphemer, ſo that God ſaued him of his ſingular grace and mercy. The lyke caſe was of many of thoſe which crucified Chriſt and ſtoned ſainct Steuen, thinkinge they did verye good ſeruice, bicauſe they eſtemed thē to be falſe prophets & enimies to God. Neuertheles did their good meaning kepe them that they wer not horible murderers? But if God gaue forgiuen them, then it foloweth

that they ſinned. And who ſhal aſſure thoſe of the lyke mercye which do as they did? I omitte the manifeſt textes, where ſuch good ententes or meaninges be curſed of god, conſydering where no fayth is, ther is nought but ſinne, and where there is no word of God, there is no fayth, but a lyinge and deceyuable opinion. I would fai

And neuertheleſſe, Chriſtendome is

thus led that to reade the Scriptures for to know the will of their Maiſter, is hereſye at this daye. And if they aledge further that the common people haue no iudgemēt for to vnderſtand y• they do read, howe happeneth it then that they teach not the Scriptures to the people to remedy that? For the ſelf ſame inconueniences haue bene in all ages▪ And neuertheles the prophetes. Ieſu Chriſt, nor the Apoſtles, neither ſpake nor writ but in the commō vulgar tonge, which was then vnderſtanded of all the people where they vſed. And when wee ſaye that hee is not a Chriſtian which knoweth not what he beleueth, nor why and wherfore he beleueth it: doo we ſaye that he muſte read the ſcriptures without hearinge them ſyncerelye expounded of thoſe whiche haue the charge & office to doe it? No, but contrariwiſe, we ſaye and alſo practyſe it, that the Paſtours are bounde to feede theyr flockes with the worde of lyfe, and that the flocke

on their parte muſte vnderſtande and learne that whiche they teache them to be edified and comforted ther by. Alſo they muſt take heede and beware of the falſe Prophets and wolfs. And certeinly if this Lampe hadd alwayes burned cleare in the Churche of God, they whiche at theſe dayes feare nothinge more then this lighte, and whiche woulde take it from the common people to leade them ſtill in their blindnes, had not ſo muche preuailed as they haue.

            For fyrſte, I knowe, that among thoſe whiche perſecute the Goſpell of God in his members, there be many that offende thorough ignoraunce whom it is very hard to make vnderſtand how muche they be deceyued, except before they be put to the reading of the textes of the ſcripture, they haue ſome brief inſtruction which may opē the matter playn vnto them, and accuſtome them with the maner of ſpeach of the holy ghoſt for to gather oute the true ſence and meaning, & referre the whole to the right vſe and end.

                  FOr as muche as Ieſus Chriſte is ye mark of our fayth, euen as is declared vnto vs in the holye Scripturea Rom. 10, b Gala. 1, b and worde of God: There foloweth two poyntes whiche are well to be noted, the one that where there is no worde of god, but onely the worde of man, what ſoeuer it be, there is no fayth but onely a dreame or opinion, which cannot but deceiue vs, ye 
                     Iohn. 17. 1. Cor. 1. d other

Poynet is, that faith embraceth and approbriateth to it ſelfe Ieſus Chriſte, and al y• is in him (for as much as he is geuen vs on that condition that wée beleeue in him) from whence one of theſe two thynges doe folow, that eyther all that which is neceſſary to our ſaluation, is not in Ieſus Chriſte, or if al be there, that hee which hath Ieſus Chriſt by faith hath all. Nowe, to ſaye that all that is neceſſary to our ſaluation is not in Ieſus Chriſt, is a blaſphemy moſt execrable, for Math. 1 Roma. 6 that were to make him no ſauiour but in a part. There reſteth then the other parte, that is to ſaye, that in hauynge Ieſus Chriſt by fayth, we haue all Roma. 5 thynges in him, according as the Apoſtle Rom. 8 ſaith that ther is no condemnation to thoſe which be in Ieſus Chriſt.
               
               
                  7. Hovve this is to be vnderſtande, vvhich vve ſaye, as Sainet Paule ſayth, that vve be iuſtified by onely faithe.
                  
                     THe reaſon is bicauſe that faith is the inſtrument which receiueth Ieſus Chriſt, and by conſequent receyueth his righteouſnes, that is to ſay, all perfection. When we ſay than as Sainct Paul ſaide, Rom. 5. 
                           •
                         Gala 2 Phil. 3, b 2. Tim. 1,

                         Titus. 3. a Hebr. 11. b that we be iuſtified by only faith, it is not to ſay that fayth is a vertue whiche maketh vs righteous in our ſelues before god (for that were to ſet our ſelues in the place of Ieſus Chriſt, the which only is our perfect and en
                        ••
                     ier righteouſnes) but we vnderſtand that we be iuſtified by fayth, for as much as it embraceth him which iuſtifyeth vs, that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt, in ſuch wiſe that it vniteth and knitteth vs together with him to be partakers of all the goodnes whiche he hath, the whiche being allowed and imprynted in vs, is fully ſufficient, to make vs perfect & accepted for righteous before God.
               
               
                  8. To be aſſured of our ſaluation by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, is nothing leſſe then arrogancie or preſumtion.
                  
                     BY this it appeareth that to be aſſured of oure ſaluation by faythe is not any arrogancy Roma. 6. Hebre. 10. or preſumption, but on the contrary part, it is the onely meanes to take all pryde from our ſelues, for to giue all glory to god. For fayth onely teacheth vs to go out of our owne ſelues, and to know that in vs there is nothyng, but matter of all damnation, and ſendeth vs to one onely Ieſus Chriſte, by whoſe onelye iuſtice it teacheth and aſſureth vs that we ſhall fynde ſaluation before God. For all that whiche is in Ieſus Chriſt (that is to ſaye, all righteouſnes and perfection) is counted and allowed to vs as properly our owne, ſo y• we embrace hym by faythe. And hereupon Sainct Bernard ſayd, Firſt ſermō of the anuntiatio
                           •
                        . that the witnes of our owne conſcience is our glorye, not ſuch a wytnes as the glorious proude Phariſey had, being deceyued in his owne thought, and deceyuinge his mayſter, the whiche witnes is not trewe: but the wytnes is trewe which

the holy ghoſt wytneſſeth to our ſpirit.
               
               
                  9 Faith fyndeth in Ieſus Chriſt, al that is neceſſary to ſaluation.
                  THis word ought to be expounded particularly, ſo that it maye be knowen whether by faythe wee doo apprehende ſuffycient remedye for to aſſure vs fully of eternall lyfe, according as is ſayde, the Roma. 1. Gala. 3. iuſte ſhall lyue by fayth. We ſay then that all that whiche letteth man to haue acquaintaunce with God, which is perfitly iuſt and good, lyeth in three poynts, in the whiche we fynde as many remedies ready prepared, not in our ſelues but in Ieſus Chriſt onely. So we haue nowe nothinge elſe Iohn. 17. of our owne, but Ieſus Chriſt, and al that which he hath. Prouided alwayes that wée be by fayth vnited and conioyned with him as pertakers of all his goodnes. For the which cauſe the Churche, that is to ſay, the aſſemble Roma. 7. of the faythfull, is called the ſpowſe of Ieſus Chriſt her huſbande, for to ſhewe the coniunction and communion

which is betwéene Ieſus Chriſt and thoſe which by faith be ioyned with him, for in vertue of this coniunctiō and ſpyrytuall maryage by fayth, hee taketh all our miſeries vpon him ſelfe, and we doo receyue all his treaſures of hym by his pure goodnes and mercy, as followeth.

                  LEt vs then ſée how in Ieſus Chriſt onely wée find
                        •
                      ſufficient remedies againſt all the temptations of Sathan & all diſmaying of conſcience. Firſt Sathan & our owne conſcience to ſhewe our vnworthines ſetteth before vs y• nature of God perfitly rightwyſe as chiefe enemie & reuenger of all iniquity, Now ſyth that wée fynde that wée be couered with an infinite number of iniquities, it foloweth that we can looke for nothing,

but the rewarde of ſinne, that is to ſaye, death Roma. 5. b eternall. What can man alledge now againſt this concluſion? Certainly, nothing, that is auayleable, except it be that which I ſhal ſay hereafter. For firſt if hee haue recourſe vnto Gods mercye, forgetting his iuſtice, hée deceyueth him ſelfe. For this is a thing moſt ſure, thatAuguſtine, the merites of Sayntes firſt reaſon. God is in ſuch wyſe mercifull, that notwithſtanding his iuſtice muſt be entierly and fully confeſſed as wée haue declared here before in the. 26. article of the. 8 point. If then we wyl aledge for a cloke to couer our ſinnes y• merites of ſaints, fyrſt we doo them great wrong, for as much as Dauid himſelfe cryeth out and ſayth: enter Pſalm. 143 not Lorde into iudgement with thy ſeruant, & in another Pſalm. 16 place he confeſſeth y• his workes can not attayne vnto God. And what ſayd Paul of Abraham that holye perſon and father of the faithfull? If Abraham c ſaith he had ben iuſtified by workes, hée had wherein to reioyce, but not towarde God: for what ſayth the ſcripture? Abraham beléeued

God, and that was compted to hym for ryghteouſneſſe. And what ſayth Saynt Paule of him ſelfe, truely 2. Cor. 4. a ſayeth he, I knowe not my ſelfe to be culpable, but yet am I not therby iuſtified. Howe can we then alledge the merites of Saintes for a ſatiſfaction for our ſins, for ſomuch as themſelues had no refuge but Philip. 3 to the only mercy of god, being pacified by Ieſus Chriſt. Second reaſon. Moreouer if it had bene ſo that the ſaintes had merited heauen by their holy lyfe, (the which coulde not be ſyth they doo teſtifie themſelues the contrary) had they not receyued already the payment and rewarde for their merites and good workes, by what ryght or tytle then can we alleadge theyr merites any more? Thirde reaſon. For to ſay that they had ſo many merites y• there remayned ouerplus for other, is that not aſmuch as fal
                        •
                     efy that which they haue left vs in writing? And what more? Is it not as much as to ſay y• they had nothing to doo with the death of Ieſus Chriſte, becauſe they had in thē more merytes and goodneſſe then they

néeded? And moreouer Fowrth reaſon. if they had merites more then they néeded, by what ryght know we that they be ours? Is it becauſe we thinke that we haue bought them? Beholde Sainte Peter reproued Symon the Magicien of this falſe and curſed marchandize: thy mony and thou peryſhe together ſayth hée, becauſe thou thynckeſt to buye the gyfte of God withActs. 8. d money. Beholde now how we thinking to honour the Saintes diſhonour them as much as we can poſſible, but nowe if the workes of Saints can take no place or profite vs in this point, what can wée finde in our ſelues, or in any other man lyuing, that can be ſufficient? But for to cutte of all ſuche falſe imaginations, let vs conſider the reaſons folowing.
                  Firſt would we not coumpt that man without his wyt which would perſwade himſelfe to be quite of his creditour vnder this colour or pretence, to haue dreamed that he had payed his debte, or that an other had payed it for him, euen ſo doo we towardes God▪ when wée be not

content with the ſatiſfaction of Ieſus Chriſte onely. For what foundation or ground hath all the wyl, workes, or merites of Saints worthyppings, but only the fantaſie and imagination of man, as though God ought to take all things well which wee inuent or ſeeme well to vs? But contrarywiſe, here what Ieſus Chriſt ſaith with his owne mouth: they honour me in Math. 7. 
                           •
                        
                      vaine ſayth be, keeping cōmaundements of men: and in another place hée ſayeth, when Eſai, 1. c ye come to appéere before my face, who required ſuch things of you to tread in my courts? &c.
                  Secondly, when we ſay that we ſtay vpon the only mercy of God, and yet doo alledge or thinke that we haue ſatiſfied or payed parte altogether, is not this a derogation to his mercie?
                  Thirdly, not to be ſatiſfied Roma. 4. a with the onely merites of Ieſus Chriſte, but to goe about to ioygne and annexe other with him, is it not as muche as to deny Ieſus Chriſte to be our onely ſauiour & to make him but a Gala. 12. d ſauiour in parts?

Fourthly, is not this the robbing of god of his perfect iuſtice Roma. 3. d and ſo conſequētly of his diuine power when we be ſo foole hardy to ſet againſt his merits y• works of man (wherin be ſo many imperfections: howe excellent ſo euer they Luke. 17▪

Thou ſayſt Sathan that God is that perfectlie righteous & reuenger of all iniquitye. I doo confeſſe, but I wyll ioygne thereto an other property of Iuſtice which thou haſt lefte out, that is, for as muche as god is righteous, he is content with one payment. Thou wylt ſaye then that there be infinite iniquities in me which deſerue eternall death. I doo graunt, but I adde more to it which y• haſte maliciouſly omitted, that is, Roma. 3.

                      that the iniquities which be in me were moſt ſufficiently reuenged and puniſhed in Ieſus

Chriſt which hath horne the iudgement of God in my ſtead, ſo vpon this I make my concluſion contrary to thine, that is to ſaye, for aſmuch as God is righteous and Roma. 3. d wyll not be payde double, and Ieſus Chriſte God 1.

Firſt although all kinde of afflictions and alſo death bée entered into the worlde thorowe ſinne, yet God when he puniſheth vs, hath not euer reſpecte to

our ſinnes as it appeareth in the hiſtory of Iob, and z many other places, but inIohn. 6. a 1.

                  THe ſecond aſſault which ſathan may make againſt vs, becauſe of our vnworthines is, that it is not ſufficient to haue lyued without ſinne, or to haue ſatiſfied for our ſyns, but is required furthermore y• man ſhould fulfyll the whole.

                  SAtan hath yet remaining one aſſault in the temptation of our vnworthynes, which is this. Although thou haſt ſatiſfyed for the payne of thy ſinnes in the perſon of Ieſus Chriſte, & that thou art alſo clothed with his righteouſneſſe, yet art thou corrupted in thy nature, Roma. 7. c wherein alwaye remayneth the roote of all ſinne.

But this in ſteade of deſmayinge vs doth rather eſtabliſhe vs. For that we do know in our hartes that wée haue faith wherby it is already ſaide in the thyrd article of this fourth point, it is not inough only to beléeue that Ieſus Chriſte came to ſaue ſynners but we muſt particularlye euerye man applye and appropriate Ieſus Chriſt to himſelf Rom. 8. a 1.

                     not periſhe, but am ſure of my ſaluation, ſo then to be aſſured that we haue

ouercome Sathan in theſe thrée aſſaults of the firſt temptation, and alſo to reſiſt the ſecond, wée muſt examine our ſelues whether we haue this faith or not. The meanes is to aſcend by the effectes vnto the knowledge of the cauſe which worketh them. Nowe the effectes which Ieſus Chriſte worketh in vs, when wée haue apprehēded him by faith be of two ſortes. The firſt is the teſtimony which the holye ſpirite bringeth to our ſpirites that we be the children of god, and which maketh vs cry abba father Roma. 8. c. in a certain aſſoraunce. Secondlye, we muſt vnderſtand when we do ioyne & appropriat to oure ſelues Ieſus Chriſte by fayth, it is not by a certaine vaine or foliſh fantaſie & Imagination, but really and Roma. 6. a 1. Iohn. 1. c. in déede although it be ſpirituallye, in ſuch wyſe y• as the ſoule bringeth foorth her effects and woorkes being naturallye vnited to the body, ſo when by faith Ieſus Chriſt is geuen to vs to dwell in vs, his vertue then bringeth and ſheweth forth his force & vertues. The which is vnderſtād

And briefelye, as the burying or ſepulture of our bodyes is a proceedyng after death, ſo is the ſepulture of the olde man a proceedyng after the death thereof, wherevnto the afflictions wherewith GOD doth dayly viſite i vs, are a great helpe, with ſpyrituall and godlye exerciſes,2.

                      the fyrſt death to the faythfull is but the fyniſhing of this mortification and burying of ſynne, making an ende of the whole battayle m. The reſurrection of the newe man is a worke of the ſame Ieſus Chriſte, lyuing and raygning in vs,Philip. 4. d. whiche in kyllinge our corrupte nature geueth vs incontynent newe force and

Beholde nowe both theſe effectes, which if we feele working in vs, the concluſion is infallible, that we haue faith, and conſequently Ieſus Chriſt in vs vnto eternal life as is aforeſayde.

                      from ſinne, that is to ſaye, from his naturall corruption by the vertue of Ieſus Chriſte dwelling in him, beginneth to doo thoſe thynges whiche we call good workes. Wherfore we ſay as the trueth is, that this fayth which we ſpeake of 1.

                  14 Thoſe do ſlaunder vs falſely, which ſaye, that we diſalowe good works.
                  
                     THey that do ſaye that we diſalowe good workes becauſe we ſaye that we be iuſtified by Ieſus Chriſt only apprehended by onely faith, do plainly and falſely ſlander vs. But we confeſſe that to geue God all the glorie, and confirme our ſelues to his holye worde▪ we differ from them in the matter of good works in three principall poyntes. For in the reſt
                        •
                      it is ſo farre from vs to ſaye that Chriſtians ought not to do good works▪ and abſtaine from euyll, that contrarywiſe we ſay that he lyeth falſely, which calleth him ſelfe a Chriſtian, and doeth not ſtudie to eſche we the euyll, and doo good. But this is it wherein lyeth our difference of this matter.
               
               
                  15 The firſt difference in the matter of good workes is, which be good, and which be euyll.
                  FIrſt, in the diſtinction of good workes and euil works before God, we do content our ſelues with the onely wyll of God, and take that for a moſt certayne rule of thoſe thynges whiche

pleaſeth or diſpleaſeth him, and ſo conſequently that which is good or euil, neither deſyre we concerning this poyncte any better wytneſſe of the wyll of God,Pſal. 119 Leuit. 18. then his holy lawe, a to the whiche it is, not lawfull to adde, or diminiſhe, b any thing. Wherefore we hold not thoſe forDeut. 4. a good woorkes, whiche be not ſtayed, but vpon the fantaſies of men, what ſoeuer they bee, and we ſaye c moreouer that it ſuffiſeth not, onely to haue the worde ofEſai. 1. c Math. 15. a God expreſly, to commaund to do, or not to do, things, but we muſt alſo in doyng the workes haue a reſpect to gods wyll, and being aſſured therby, to go forward in good workes: for otherwiſe nothing can be acceptable to God. d For as ſaint Paul ſaith, y• which is don without faith that is to ſaye, all y• is done

                  16 vvhich be the moſt excellent works & the qualities of true praier according to the vvord of God, and the authoritie of the auncient doctours of the Church.
                  
                     PRoceding as we haue ſaid before y• as the lawe whiche wée call the ten commaundementes is deuided in two tables, y• one comprehending thoſe thinges whiche we owe to God, and the other that we owe to our neighbours: ſo lykewyſe there are two ſortes of good workes, the one concerning the ſeruice and loue of God, the other to our neighbours. The firſt doth excell the ſeconde, euen aſmuch as God doth excel any creature. But amongſt all the fruites that fayth bringeth foorth vniuerſallye in all Chriſtians, we thinke that y• inuocation of y• name of God by Ieſus Chriſt is theThis is approoued thorowe the whole ſcripture. chiefe, which we cal praier and is to god moſt acceptable. Whether it be that we deſire any thing of him, or that wée render thanks to him. But we deſire in our prayer theſe which followeth.

Then foloweth the ſeconde poynte▪ that is to ſay, y• all prayer which is not ruledb Roma. 14. according to the word of god is nothing woorth, conſidering y• thoſe praiers that be made without fayth are but ſinne, & wher there is no word of God, there can be no fayth, Roma. 10. c. but onely a foolyſh & vaine opinion, as we haue ſaide here before in the. vi. article.

For as we can neuer ſufficientlye humble and eſtéeme our felues vnworthy in our owne ſight, ſo on the contrarye, before we praye (except wée wyll praye in vaine) let vs bée aſſured that for aſmuch as we be recōcyled to God by his ſonne, which is our onlye ſufficient interceſſour and aduocate, wee can not fayle but to obtayne thoſe thynges whiche wee deſyre by him, ſo that it bée expedyent for vs▪ and without this confydence it is impoſſyble toHomili. 12 de Cananitide. bée hearde.

But what man is ſo foolyſhe and reachleſſe of his lyfe, which wyll geue to an Earle that honour which hée oweth to a King.
                  Item, in the ſame place, they go to the Kinge (ſayeth he) by the meanes of hys officers, becauſe the King is a man, not

But to pleaſe God, whiche is not ignoraunt in any thinge, and knoweth what eache one meryteth and deſerueth, wee haue no néede of Aduocates to ayde vs wyth theyr ſuffrages or prayers, but we haue néede of a holy thought and meditation. Following then the rule of holy Scripture, and the aucthoritie of the good auncient Fathers, wée doo eſtéeme and allowe true prayers to bée the moſte agréeable thinges that Chriſtians maye offer to God, among thoſe commaundements of the fyrſt table, wherein there is conteyned an expreſſe confeſſion, as well of the power as of the goodneſſe of God, with the feare and reuerence dew to him onely.
                  
                     ¶ Of workes of Charitie.
                     In the ſeconde place we eſtéeme the workes of Charitie towarde our neighbours accordynge to the commaundement of the ſeconde Table, whiche doo procéede of the true loue of God, wée

being reconcyled to hym in Ieſus Chriſte, for whoſe ſake wee loue our neighbours although they hate vs. For otherwyſe all that wee doo is nothyng woorthe, what ſhewe or apparaunce ſo euer it hath in our lyfe, as Ieſus Chriſt declareth vnto vs by the example of the Phariſees.

                  17 The ſeconde difference in the matter of good workes, is to know from vvhence they proceede.
                  THe ſeconde difference in this matter of woorkes, is concerning the very roote or ſpryng from whence they do procéede. For we deny not ſimplye that fayth and good woorkes procéede from oure intellygence and wyll, being firſt preuented, chaunged, ayded,

and accompanyed by the grace of God. But before all this we affyrme and ſay that in ſearchinge the roote or fyrſte ſpringe of that lytle goodneſſe which is in vs, vtterlye there is no beginning at all of any naturall diſpoſition in vs, to receyue the grace to the ende that ſuche diſpoſition ſhoulde bee aſſyſted by the ſeconde grace. But cleane contrarie there is naturallye in vs nothinge but darknes, Eſai. 9. a. Luke. 1. g. Actes. 2. b. and enemitie againſt God, Roma. 5. b. Ephe. 2. a wherfore it was néedefull y• god ſhould of his onelye mercie, fyrſte of all drawe vs, Iohn. 6. c. that is to ſaye, to make vs altogether newe creatures, Iohn. 3. 1. Peter. 1. concernyng the quallyties, lyghtning thoſe which be not onely partlye blynded, but vtterlye darkneſſe it ſelfe, geuinge vs hartes to vnderſtande, Deut. 30, Ierim, 24. chaunginge our ſteny heartes into fleſhie heartes, Ezech. 11. creatyng in vs pure hartes, Pſalm. 
                           •
                        1. Ezech. 16. Ephe. 1. that is to ſaye, makinge newe altogeather that is within vs, of a wycked wyll, a good and godlye wyll: briefelye, workinge in vs to wyll and alſo to doo. Philip. 2. 
                           •
                        . So that the Apoſtles

woordes be verified, that we cannot only thinke of our ſelues any thing that is good, 1. Cor. b. and that the children of God haue nothing but that which they receyued by grace. 1. Cor. 4. So then for aſmuch as grace muſt make vs good trées before wee can beare good fruite, it foloweth that there is no méeting together of grace and free Looke about in the. 14. article, the 3. poynt. wyll: for the ſpirite of God by his pure grace hath made vs free from ſinne, Iohn. 8. c. in vnyting vs by fayth to Ieſus Chriſt, from whome we get a new life, to bring foorth fruite to God, 1. Cori. 4. b. and lykewyſe when our wyll being made free & worketh thorowe grace there is no merites, but onely frée rewarde geuen, not being due. For on ye contrary, the beſt workes that we can doo deſerue eternall payne, were it not for the grace of God, for the beſt workes of them ſelues doo but pollute the grace, which God hath put in them Roma. 4. a. Philip. 3. b..
               
               
                  18 The thirde difference of the matter of good worke, is to knowe wherto they be good.
                  
                     THe thirde difference is yet greater, that is to ſaye, touchinge the worthineſſe of good workes, for our parte to ſpeake in fewe wordes, that for to vnderſtande by what ryght or tytle we bee aſſured of eternall lyfe, onelye Ieſus Chriſt contenteth Roma. 3. c vs, being geuen to vs, and applyed to vs by fayth onely, by the onelie grace & mercie of God, as we haue ſayde before more at large. And therefore wee deteſt and abhorre this woorde, merites, or to merite, and confeſſe with harte and mouth, that concernynge the beſte woorkes whiche we can doo, we count our ſelues vnprofytable ſeruauntes, Luke. 17. c Pſalm. 16 and that eternall lyfe is altogether of the pure and frée mercye and gyft of God. Roma. 9. d Wherefore I make this argument more then hath béene ſayde before in the tenthe article. Good woorkes commeth from Ieſus Chriſte dwellinge in vs, by whoſe power and vertue we do them by grace, as the corrupt nature of Adam, in the whiche we were borne, bryngeth forth in vs ſinne.

For we muſt poſſeſſe Ieſus chriſt which is y• good trée, before we can bring foorth good fruite in him. For the cauſe ought to go before the effect Rom. 6. a. And as S. Paul declareth that whatſoeuer is done without faith Rom. 4. d. is ſinne, it foloweth then conſequentlie that faith goeth before good works. For by it onely we embrace Ieſus Chriſte. Nowe he which hath true faith, is immediatly iuſtified, being fullie quieted and pacified in his cōſcience. Rom. 5. a Howe then can good workes Iuſtifie vs? and conſequentlie ſaue vs. For we muſt of neceſſity be iuſtified, and ſo conſequentlie haue iuſt tytle to Saluation, before wée can doo any one good worke. In this lyeth all our conſolatiō, that we haue, our onelie refuge, to the ſpeciall grace and mercie which is preſented to vs, in Ieſus Chriſt onelie, which is not our Sauiour and redéemer in part, but all altogether.
               
               
                  19 To vvhat ende good vvorkes doo ſerue vs before God and before men.
                  
                     BY this it appeareth plainelie howe wrōgfully they charge vs as though we did diſalow good workes: where as on the contrarie we doo with all our powers endeuour our ſelues as muche as is poſſible for vs to declare which be the verie true good workes, and from what ſpring or fountaine they procéede, that the ſymple people be not deceyued ignorauntlie. Notwithſtanding, we do not groūd our ſelues in any reſpect vpon our workes, neither in part nor in al phil. 3. d Rom. 6. d 1. Cor. 4. a whē we come to declare by what tytle eternal life is giuen vs, but content our ſelues with Ieſus Chriſt only. And alſo we acknowledge our regeneratiō with the fruites proceedinge to our ſynguler comfort as foloweth.
                  Fyrſte good workes ſerue to profite our neighbours, and alſo to prouoke the verie Infidels to geue glorie mark. 3. b

                  Fowrthlie, good workes be certaine teſtimonies of our Faith, and alſo doo

aſſure of our eternall Election, for fayth is neceſſarilie ioyned to Election. Nowe that this is ſo muche more neceſſarie as the worlde maketh leſſe accoumpt of it, ſuppoſing that the doctrine of election were a certaine curious and incomprehenſible thing, which is contrarie. Fayth is no other thing but an aſſuraunce whiche wee haue that the promyſes of eternall lyfe appertayneth vnto vs, becauſe we were predeſtined and elected therevnto. Wherefore all that is ſpoken of fayth and of the fruytes of faythe is ſpoken in vayne, and vnprofytable, excepte wee Ioyne this poynct of election as the onely ſtaye and foundation of all that is aforeſayde.
                  Nowe when Sathan putteth vs in doubte of oure election, wee maye not ſearch firſt the reſolution in the eternal counſel of god whoſe maieſty we cannot comprehende, but on the contrarye wée muſt begin at the ſanctification whiche we fele in our ſelues to aſcende vp more

hier for aſmuch as our ſanctification frō whence procéedeth good works, is a certaine effect of the faith Rom. 8. b. or rather of Ieſus Chriſte welling in vs by faith. And whoſoeuer is vnited to Ieſus Chriſte is neceſſarilie called and elected of God to ſaluation in ſuch wiſe as he ſhall neuer be reiected nor forſakē. So it appearethr Iohn. 9. d that the ſanctifycation with the fruites therof be as y• fyrſt ſtep or degrée wherby we begin to aſcende vp to the fyrſt & true cauſe of our ſaluation, to wéete of our frée eternall electiō: For whoſoeuer ſaith that he beleueth Rom. 10, 
                           •

For this cauſe Saint Peter admoniſhed vs to make our 2. Pet. 1. b vocation & Election ſure by good workes. Not that they be the cauſe or y• foundation of our vocation & Election, (For S.v 1. Cor. 4. a Rom. 4. c Paule declareth plainly the contrarie.) But for aſmuch as good works bring a certaine teſtimony to our 1. Pet. 3. d conſcience, that Ieſu Chriſt dwelleth in vs, & conſequently

we cannot periſhe, beinge elected to Iohn. 6. d ſaluation.
               
               
                  20. Remedies againſt the laſt and moſt daungerous temptation, vvhiche is▪ vvhether vve be ſaued or not.
                  HEre reſteth yet the laſt and moſte daungerous temptations of all. Sometime it hapneth that Ieſus Chriſt deferreth to call ſome of his elected vntyl y• laſt howre of their Math. 20. b life, ſo ye it ſéemeth y• they be not very well furniſhed with theſe vertues wherof we haue ſpoken, neither did euer féele them, forLuke. 23. f that ye cauſe was not as yet working in them, and the cauſe muſt goe before the effect. And alſo ſometimes the perfecteſt and moſt holyeſt perſons fall into this extremitie, ſorrowing and lamenting for that they feele not theſe good mocions, but ſéemeth that it is vtterly quenched in them: and then Sathan bringeth in theſe doubtes, that where as before they thought they had faith but was not but a ſhadow or vain appearāce of faith,

Or elles that whereas they beleued before, nowe by theyr owne fault the gift is taken from them. Nowe wee muſte take heede to reſiſt thys temptatyon as moſt daungerous of all.
                  Concerning thoſe whiche feele theyr vocatiō to be long ere it come to thē, yet their aſſurance is neuertheleſſe grounded and eſtabliſhed vppon ſome of theſe articles and effects aforeſaid. And as for their interior teſtimonie of cōſcience, of tentymes it worketh more lyuelye then in ſome of thoſe which are called muche ſooner, as the experience is well declared in the poore théefe that was hanged by Chriſte. And concerning the workes of regeneration, it is to be vnderſtande that the greteſt and moſt eccellent workesNote vvel whiche the holye ghoſte worketh in vs, is the hate of ſynne, the loue of God, the aſſuraunce of our ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſte, and the inuocation of hys name. Wherefore, he that feeleth theſe mocions in hym ſelfe, although it bée not vntyll the houre of death, hathe a

certayne teſtimonie of hys true faythe▪ and conſequently of his election and ſaluation. And for thoſe whiche féele thoſe good mocions quenched in them, ſorowing and lamentyng, as it happeneth ſometimes to the holieſt & moſt perfecteſt perſons: Let them conſyder theſe pointes folowyng to ouercome ſuche temptations.
                  Firſt, for as much as the two operations and effectes aforeſayde, bee as the two Ankers to holde vs faſt, and when one fayleth, to ſticke the more ſurer to the other, vntyll wee haue gotton ſtrength on bothe ſydes againe.
                  As when Dauid and Sainct Peter fell ſo beaſtly, yet there is no doubt but they lamented and ſorrowed, vntyll they felt the workyng of theyr regeneration and ſanctification, But béeyng in theyr temptation, they ſtayed them ſelues vpon the Anker of the teſtymonye which the ſpirite of God broughte into their conſcyence, whyche cauſed them not to doubte (not withſtandynge theyr

fall) but that they were the children of God, and that theyr fault was forgeuen them.
                  Secondly, although both theſe operations and effectes, bee verye féeble and weake, yet ther is no cauſe to be diſcouraged. For it is not required of vs for to beleue Math. 17. 
                           •
                        
                      fullye and perfecttlye but to beleue onelye, in ſuche wiſe as if one lytle ſparke of fayth, and ſo folowyng one lytle mocion of the workyng of it, (ſo that it be true and vnfaynedly, that is to ſaye comminge from the true roote of fayth) bee ſufficient to aſſure vs of oure ſaluation. The reaſon is, for that oure ſaluation is not onely ſtayed vpon oure fayth (although without faythe none can be ſaued) but vpon hym whome we apprehende by fayth, that is to ſaye Ieſus Chriſt. And fayth is of ſuche vertue that accordinge to the promiſe of God, one lytle ſparke thereof, how lytle ſo euer it bee, doth apprehende Ieſus Chriſt fully and perfectlye.
                  Yet not withſtandyng the greater our

fayth is, the greater power it hath to ioyne vs nearer & nearer, and to graffe vs déeper in Ieſus Chriſte. And wee ought to be diſpleaſed and to lament, when in ſteede of goinge forewarde we recoyle and ſlyde backwarde, and yet the Diuell hath not wonne his proceſſe. Although we ſlyde backe, ſo that our ſlyding bring vs to ſteppe vp againe and go the better forwarde.
                  Thyrdlie when we be ſo lamenting and troubled for the feelynge of our neclygence and ſynnes, let vs ſéeke to the lyke examples of the Saintes which were as deepe in as wée, or rather deeper, yet neuertheleſſe they ceaſed not to pray, with aſſurance to be hard becauſe they were the chyldren of God, howe great and beaſtly ſinnes ſoeuer they had commytted. Set before vs then their examples not to contynue in ſynne, for they contynued not therein when they were waked of the Lorde: but let vs folowe theyr repentaunce and aſſuraunte whyche they had of theyr ſaluation.

And conclude that Sathan is a lyar when he would make vs beleeue that our faith was neuer good, although for a time the workinge and effectes thereof were bidden, whiche is as muche as to ſaye there is no fire bicauſe there is no flame. Or that the trées be deade in winter, bicauſe there is no gréene leaues nor fruite, or appearaunce of life.
                  Fowrthlie, let vs haue recourſe vnto the ſurer and perfecter remedie, whiche is the certainetie of our Election eſtabliſhed vppon the immutable purpoſe of God. And to haue the certaine teſtimonie of this infallible and vnmoonable Election, although the motions and workinges of faith, ſéeme to bee quenched and periſhed in vs, call to remembraunce the dayes paſte of the example of Dauid, and wee ſhall finde moſt certaine teſtimonies of the fauour of God towardes vs, ſo that we ſhall not neede to doubte. Alſo we maye finde that ſometimes wee had the workinge of faith, and ſo of our Election and ſaluation

whiche were ſo manyfeſt in vs, that the Deuyll him ſelfe can not denye but then we were in the fauour of God, and had true fayth. For without fayth no man can pleaſe God. But if Sathan replie to that, that then wée had faythe, but nowe wée haue loſt it, and that God hath taken his grace cleane from vs. Let vs aunſwere boldely that this is as falſe a doctrine as the aucthour thereof is a lyer. For thoſe two poyntes bée infallible, firſt God neuer chaungeth his purpoſe and aduiſe. The other is, that which he hath once purpoſed muſt come to paſſe, whatſoeuer lettes and ſtoppes doe come. Alſo ioyne the thirde reaſon to this, which is, that fayth is a particuler gift, and belongeth onely to the elect as I will proue. For he that beleueth isIohn. 6. d vnited and knit to Ieſus Chriſte. And therefore can neuer dye.
                  Theſe foundations beyng layde, I affirme that whoſoeuer hath a certayne teſtimonie of his faith once in all hys life, may be aſſured that it is there ſtyll,

and ſhalbe vntyll the ende, although for a time they feele it not, nor perceyue it. For doeth it followe that a little chylde hath no reaſonable ſoule in him, bicauſe he hath not the vſe of it? Or that a dronken man hath not a reaſonable ſoule, becauſe that for a time he hath loſt ye vſe & féeling thereof? Peter denyed his maiſter with an oth. Was his faith therfore voyde and naught? or did the Lord geue him a newe fayth? No, but on the contrarye, accordyng to the prayer that Chriſte made for hym, hys fayth neuer fayled him altogether. And as the vytal and liuely ſpirite and ſtrength is not cleane out of him that for a time ſéemeth to bée rather dead then aliue, not onely by the iudgement of Phiſitions, but alſo by his owne féeling. Wherefore let vs kéepe ſtedfaſt this precyous teſtimonie of our faith, and kéepe theſe infallible argumentes agaynſt Sathan in this harde battayle, aſſuring our ſelues, that if euer faith were in vs, it is there ſtyll and ſhall be. Wherefore, wée

conclude, that we be the children and elected of God, & wée ſhall neuer periſhe, but he heard and receyued of him to our amendement: thus calling vppon himNote. which neuer chaungeth nor altereth his purpoſe, neyther wyll condempne him to daye, that he was determined to ſaue yeſterdaye. Let vs knowe then that our ſaluation dependeth vppon the eternall prouidence and wyll of him that hath giuen vs to his ſonne, who ſayde piainlie that he woulde not loſe one of thoſeIohn. 6. which his Father had giuen him, nor they ſhoulde neuer be reiected. For it is moſt neceſſary that our ſaluation ſhould remaine in ſurer handes then our own. But there maye bée alleaged certaine reaſons contrarie to this doctrine, but they be eaſily refuted, as is amply declared from point to point, in ſūdrie bookes ſet foorth in our time of this matter.

                     IT hathe béen declared in the Article goyng before, howe it is the holy ghoſt whyche createths vs in the Inſtrumente of the true faithe, and whiche be the effectes and operations thereof in vs, that is to ſay, to apprehend and take hold of Ieſus Chriſt, in whom only we fynde all that is required and neceſſary to iuſtifie and ſaue vs. Secondly we muſte vnderſtand with what inſtruments the holy Ghoſte is ſerued to create fayth in vs, and furthermore by what maner or how, as we haue declared before that he is ſerued with two inſtrumentes wherof we ſhall ſpeake diſtinctly.
               
               
                  22 What it is that vve call the vvorde of God, and of the tvvo partes, that is to ſay, the lavve and the Goſpell.
                  WE call the word of God the canonicall bookes of the old and newe teſtament, and no other thing whatſoeuer it be. And wée deuide this woorde into two kyndes or parts, of the which one is called the law, and the other the goſpell. For al the reſt depēd on the one or other,

of theſe two partes. We call law when it is diſtincte from the Goſpell, a certayne doctrine whoſe ſéede is naturally written in oure hartes, the whyche neuertheleſſe for a more expreſſe declaration, was written of God, and comprehended briefly in the. x. commaundementes, by the which he declareth to vs the obedience and perfecte ryghteouſneſſe, whiche we owe to his maieſtye and to oure neyghbours. Under a chaungeable condition, Deut. 27. 
                           •
                        am. 2. that is to ſay, eyther of lyfe eternall (ſo that wée haue perfectly fulfilled the whole lawe withont breakyng any one poynte) or elſe death eternal for lack of the entier fulfilling and accompliſhing the contents of euery parcell of the commaundementes. Wee call the Goſpell or Euangelie (that is to ſay good newes) a certayne doctrine reuealed from heauen, and Matth. 19. Iohn. 1. altogether ſurmounting the naturall ſenſe of man: by the which word God Roma. 3. declareth to vs, that hee will ſaue vs fréely by his onely ſonne, ſo that wee embrace and accept him by fayth, as oure

only wiſdome, righteouſnes, ſanctification, & redemption, 1. Cor. 1. d by the whiche alſo I ſay he teſtifieth to vs theſe things, yea in ſuche wiſe, that incontinent he renueth1 1. Cor. 
                           •

                  23. What difference there is betvveene the lavve and the Goſpell.
                  THeſe things be greatly to be noted, for it may iuſtly be ſaid, that y• ignorance of this diſtinction betwéene ye law and the Goſpel, is one of the principal cauſes & rootes of al the abuſe, which hath corrupted, and yet doth corrupt the whole Chriſtianitie, bycauſe the moſte parte of men blynded by the iuſt iudgement of God, haue neuer well conſidered, into what malediction and curſe the lawe hath brought vs, neyther for what purpoſe it was ordayned of God. And concerning the goſpel they haue almoſt eſtéemed it to be no other thing, but an other lawe more perfect than the olde, from whence immediatly did ſpring this diſtinction betwéene precepte and councell

with ye whole ruine of al ye benefits of Ieſus Chriſt. But we muſt conſider theſe things more nerer. It is eaſy to gather of that whyche hathe ben ſayde in the former article, what is common bothe to the law and the Goſpell, and what eche hath properly belonging to it ſelf. Hebr. 1. They haue this in common: bothe be of one onely very God, who remayneth continually like vnto him ſelfe, ſo that we may not thinke that the one aboliſheth the other, concerninge the ſubſtaunce, but contrarye, the one eſtablyſheth the ſubſtaunce of the other. As we ſhall ſaye hereafter▪ 
                     Rom. 1
                           •
                        . They bothe doe purpoſe and ſette foorth to vs one God onely, and one righteouſneſſe in ſubſtaunce, Roma. 3. wherein conſiſteth the perfyte loue of GOD, and oure neyghboure. But beholde where the dyfference lyeth. The lawe is naturally in man, in whoſe harte God prynted and engraued it from the creation. Roma. a. 1. For thoſe preceptes whiche God did declare a longe tyme after in the twoo tables of hys lawe, was not to make a

newe lawe, but onelye to quycken and reuiue the lawe naturall, whych by litle and litle was quenched and blotted out in the harts of men through the corruption of ſinne. Roma. 7. But the goſpell is a doctrine ſupernatural, y• which our nature coulde neuer attayn, neither could allowe without ye ſpecial grace and gifte of god, 1. Cor. 1. who reueled it vnto Adam ſone after his fall, as Moyſes reciteth, Gene 3. and after to the patriarches and Prophets, from generation to generation as ſemed good to hym, Roma. 1. Luke. 1. vntill ſuch time as he ſent Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne perſonally, whiche declared Iohn. 15. & fulfylled all that is contayned in the goſpell: and alſo declareth it vnto this day, and will declare it vntill the ende of the world by the preaching of the ſame word inſtituted in his Church. Iohn. 17 Matth. 28. 2. Colloſſ. 5. Furthermore the lawe declareth to vs the maie
                        ••
                     y and iuſtice of God ſeuerely and ſtraightly: Hebr. 12. the goſpell declareth to vs the ſame iuſtice, but ſo as it is appeaſed and ſatiſfyed through mercy, Hebr. 1
                           •
                        . as it is declared in the third point. 26. article.
                  
                     Thirdly the lawe ſendeth vs home in to our ſelues, to fulfill the righteouſnes whiche it declareth and requireth of vs, that is to ſay, the entire and perfect fulfylling of the commaundementes, without omytting or fayling in any poynte, & ſo ſetteth before vs oure curſe & malediction, and ſubdueth vs vnder it as the Apoſtle declareth. Rom. 3 c. Gala. 3. But the Goſpell ſheweth vs where we ſhall finde that whyche we haue not, and fynding it, how we may enioye it, and ſo deliuer vs from the malediction & curſe of the law. Rom. 3. c Gala. 3. b For a concluſion, the law pronounceth vs bliſſed and happy in fulfilling it perfectly, nothing left out nor omitting, the Goſpel promiſeth vs ſaluation in beléeuing, that is to ſay, in embracing him by faithe, who hath intirely and fully thoſe things which we do lacke, yea and more than we do lacke. Nowe theſe two couenantes, that is to ſay, to do that which ye law commaundeth, or beleue that which God offreth in Ieſus Chriſte, be two things not onely moſt hard & difficil, but

vtterly vnpoſſible to our corrupt nature ye which cannot only ſomuch as think a good thought as ſayth S. Paule. 2. Corin. 3. Phillip. 1. 2. Theſsa 3. 
                           •
                        . Wherfore we muſte ioyne yet an other fourth difference, which is, that that lawe doth but declare vnto vs, yea rather augment our euil, and doth encreaſe our condēnatiō, not by hir fault (for the lawe is good & holy) but bycauſe that our corrupt nature is inclined and inflamed to ſinne, ſo much ye more as it is reproued & threatned, as S. Paule declareth by his owne example, Roma. 7. but the Goſpel ouer & beſide ye declaration of the remedy & medicine againſt the malediction of the lawe, then immediatly being ioyned & accompanied wt the vertue & power of the holy ghoſt, regenerateth vs (as we haue ſayde here before) creating in vs the inſtrument & meane to appropriate to vs thys medicine. Actes. 26. c To ſpeake more plainly, the Goſpell declareth not onely to vs barely and ſymple our Saluation, by the ryghteouſnes of Chryſte Ieſus in beléeuing, but alſo the holy ghoſt with the ſame giueth

vs power and ſtrengthe, to beléeue Acts. 16. and to perceyue and ſée the fruite and profyte of Ieſus Chryſt, whiche it declareth to vs. So that now the law whiche killed & damned vs in oure ſelues, nowe ſaueth vs in Ieſus Chryſt thorow fayth. Roma. 3. For this cauſe I ſayd, that the law and the Goſpell bée not contrary in the ſubſtaunce of the ryghteouſneſſe, which wée ought to bryng before GOD, but onely in the meane howe to haue his ryghteouſneſſe For the lawe ſearcheth it in vs, and that wyth good ryghte, not regarding what we can or maye, but what we owe: Gala. 3. foraſmuche as man by his onely faulte, hathe broughte hymſelfe detter, and not able to paye, and therefore is not diſcharged, althoughe hée be not able to ſatiſfie therefore. And the lawe doothe vs no wrong to demaunde of vs that whyche we owe, although we can not paye it, but the Goſpell dothe temper thys rygour by the mercye of God, without diminiſhyng any parte of the diuine Iuſtice.
                  
                     We learne to pay by him, who hath ſet himſelfe detter and payer for vs, whiche hath put hymſelfe I ſaye, in our place, and hathe payde oure dette, as the principall detter, euen vnto the vttermoſte pennye, Colloſſ. 2. c in ſuche wyſe that the rygoure of the lawe, whiche did before feare vs, nowe comforteth vs in Ieſus Chryſte, for as muche as lyfe eternall is due to thoſe, whiche haue fully obeyed the law and Ieſus Chryſte hathe fulfylled the ſame for vs. So it followeth, that according to the extremitie and rigour of the lawe, Saluation can not fayle to thoſe1. Cor. d. Philip. 3. which by fayth be vnited and incorporated into Ieſus Chriſt.
               
               
                  24 After vvhat maner the preachyng of the lavve ſerueth the holy Ghoſt.
                  VNderſtandyng well the diſtinction of the two kyndes of the woorde of God, that is to ſaye, the lawe and the Goſpell. It is eaſye to vnderſtande howe the holy Ghoſt is ſerued with them for an inſtrumente of oure ſaluation.

For it is not to be doubted, but the holy Ghoſte doth ioyne them to the vſe they were ordeyned. For as much then as we be al ſo blinded, whyleſt our corruption raygneth in vs, that euen we forgette oure owne blyndeneſſe and ignoraunce, Iohn. 9. b and ceaſe not to quenche out the ſmall lyght of vnderſtanding which hath bene lefte to vs, to make vs more inexcuſable, Roma. 1. we reioyce and pleaſe our ſelues in that whyche ought moſt to diſpleaſe vs. Fyrſte, before all thyngs it is requiſite that the ſpirite of God who is al goodneſſe, and ful of all pietie, doe make vs to vnderſtande perfectely the depthe of the malediction and curſe wherein we nowe ſtande, whiche he can not better doe, than in ſetting before vs the declaration of his lawe, what we ought to doe, and alſo what we be. As the coloure of blacke is neuer better ſette foorthe than when whyte is ſette by it, Roma. 3. ſo the ſpirite of God beginneth by the preachyng of the lawe wherein wée maye ſée what we doe owe, and what we be not

hable to pay. And conſequently howe neare we be to our condemnation, if there be no otherwiſe founde ſome remedy. And alſo the inuinſible dulneſſe whiche alwayes hath raygned in the world, and raygneth yet more than euer it did, declareth ſufficiently howe neceſſarie it is that God ſhoulde beginne at this ende, to drawe vs to himſelfe, that is to ſay, in declaring vnto vs, in howe great and euident daungers thoſe be whiche make leaſt accompt of it. For the lawe was not gyuen to iuſtifie vs, (for if it were ſo the Goſpell were not needefull, and Ieſus Chryſte dyed in vaine, as ſaythe Sainte Paule) Gala. 2. d but to condemne vs, and to ſhewe the Hells al open to ſwallowe vs. And alſo to abaſe and bring downe oure fearce and hye pryde, declaring to vs the multytude of oure ſynnes, and the wrathe of God, which he declareth and pronoūceth from Heauen agaynſte vs. Roma. 1

So nowe ye maye beholde the firſte vſe and profite of the preachynge of the lawe▪ whyche is the declaration of oure innumerable ſynnes, for to diſpleaſe vs, and make vs ſory, and to humble and throw downe oure ſelues to the vttermoſt, and alſo to kyndle in vs the fyrſte poynt of repentaunce, whyche they call contrition, from whence followeth the confeſſion

of ſynnes towardes God. For that man will neuer come to the Phiſition to bée healed, whyche thinketh not himſelfe to be ſicke: ſo there be no people more vnapte to be taught and lyghtned of god vnto ſaluation, than thoſe which thinke they vnderſtand and ſée clerely of themſelues. But for lacke of vnderſtanding, they be our whelmed and doubled in the darkeneſſe wherin they were borne, Iohn. 9. and ſo ſwallowe them ſelues continually therein.
               
               
                  25. Of the other parte of the worde of God called the Goſpell, of what authorite it is. Wherefore, howe, and to what ende it is written.
                  AFter the lawe, commeth the Goſpell, the vſe wherof cannot be better vnderſtande than by the obſeruation of theſe poynts which folowe.
                  Firſte, as there is but one Sauioure, Matth. 1. Actes. 4. 1. Tim. 2. ſo there is but one onely doctrine of ſaluation, whyche is called the Goſpell, Roma. 1. that is to ſaye, glad tydyngs, or good

newes, the whiche hath béenefully and perfectly declared and ſignifyed to the worlde, by Ieſus Chryſte, Iohn. 15. c. hys Apoſtles and Euangelyſtes, Iohn. 17. 1. Corin. 1

Peter. 1. d that we myghte auoyde the ſuttilties and craftes of Sathan, whyche woulde more eaſly, were not the Goſpell, ſpred foorthe hys lyes vnder the name of the Goſpell, the whiche neuertheleſſe he ceaſeth not to doe continually by the iuſt vengeaunce of God, againſte thoſe whyche haue alwayes loued darkeneſſe better than light. And where we ſaye that the Apoſtles and Euangelyſtes haue faythfully written and regiſtred all the Euangelicall doctrine, we do vnderſtand three poyntes.
                  The firſte, that they haue not added or put to any thing whiche was giuen them in charge, concerning the ſubſtance of the doctrine. Collo. 1. d 2. Timo. 3. For Chriſt ſayde to them, goe ye and preache all thoſe thyngs whiche I haue Matth. 28. commaunded you. And as Sainte Paule proteſteth in

writing to the 1. Cor. 1
                           •
                        . Corinthians.
                  The ſeconde is, that they haue omitted nor lefte out nothing, which is neceſſarie to ſaluation. For then had they béene vnfaythfull in their charge and office, the whiche coulde not be. And alſo we ſee what S. Paule and S. Peteri Act. 20. Gala. 1. b. 
                     2 Peter. 1. d. witneſſeth according to Ieſus Chryſtes wordes. And S. Auguſtine playnely declareth and ſaythe, true it is that the Lorde hath done many thyngs the which be not all written, for the Euangeliſtl Iohn. 15. teſtifieth, that Ieſus Chryſte hathn Auguſtine vpon the▪ 11. of Iohn. tract▪ 49▪
                      ſayde and done many things, the whiche be not al written, but they haue written thoſe things which ought to be written, and which is ſufficient for the ſaluation of all belouers.
                  The third poynt is, that that whiche they haue written is ſo playnly written that the moſt ſimple and ignorant of al the worlde, if the faulte be not in them ſelues may learne what is neceſſarie to their ſaluation. 1. Cor. 1. For elſe wherefore was the Goſpell written in a language

that all might vnderſtand Corin 14. it, and alſo in ſuche a maner of ſpeakyng, whiche was moſte familiar and acquaynted among the people, that was poſſible to bée choſen. 1. Corin. 2. Therfore ſayd S. Paule, that if the Goſpell bée hidden, it is hidden to thoſe whiche periſhe, whome the god of this worlde hathe blynded their ſenſes and vnderſtanding, that is to ſaye, the vnbeléeuers. 1. Corin. 4. And certainely the experience hath declared alwayes, that God hathe not called the moſt wyſe and of greateſt knoweledge, but the ſimple and ignoraunt of the worlde, Eſay. 29. Luke. 10. 1. Corin. 1. muche leſſe would he hyde it, or ſo darken his doctrine that it ſhould not be vnderſtande of all men, whereof wée gather two concluſions to this purpoſe.
                  The firſte, that nothyng is Goſpell whiche men haue added to the woorde of God wrytten, or dyminyſhed from it, but all is mere ſuperſtition and corruption of the true and onely Goſpell of our Lorde, Gala. r. 2. Timo. 3. Matth. 15. as Saincte Paule hathe ſpoken. And Saincte Hierome wryting of thys

matter y• ſayth he, which is ſpoken without the auctoritie of the holy ſcripture, is eaſelie confuted and to bee reiected and diſperſed▪

                      to reade the ſcripture, and for that cauſe wyll not haue it tranſlated into the vulgar tongue, for feare that ſimple Women & other people ſhould reade it, Roma. 1. b Galat n. 3.

That is to ſaye certaine peeces of Chapters rent or deuided without purpoſe or reaſon of the bookes of the fowre Euāgelyſtes, or the Epiſtles of Saint Paule in theyr Maſſe: but we doo comprehende

vnder this woorde Goſpell, not onelie all the newe Teſtament, but alſo all that which hath bene prophecied to come, or promiſed in the old Teſtament touching Ieſus Chriſte Actes. 26. Iohn. 5 Roman. 1. For as we haue ſaide, the Goſpell is the onelie meane by the which GOD from the beginning of the worlde hath alwaies ſaued his electe, Hebre. 1 Actes 4. and therfore began to declare it in the beginning of Gene.

                     THirdly, when wee ſaye that the Goſpell ſo written and regyſtred as God hath geuen it vs, Rom. 1. is the onely ordinary meane, with the whiche the ſpirite of God is ſerued to ſaue man, by reaſon whereof this word is called the word of lyfe Iohn. 6.

Peter is wytnes, wryttyng to all the faythfull when he prayſeth them for the dilligence whiche they tooke to Reade and vnderſtande the Prophet 2. pet. 1, rightlie. For he knewe when the Lorde had ſayde to him feede my ſhéepe Iohn. 21., was to be vnderſtande of the preachinge of the woorde of lyfe Actes. 20.. As Saint Paule expounded it and practiſed it.
                  Yet notwithſtanding, wee doo not ſaye, that euerie one ought to be a Doctour and expoſitour of the holye Scrypture. For this office appertayneth to thoſe which bee called and ordayned lawfullye to doo it in the Churche. Roma, 10. But wee ſpeake of readynge the Scrypture, to be confyrmed in that which hath bene expounded, and to reiect the falſe Doctrine of falſe Paſtours, and Teachers. And we deny that the reading of the holie Scripture, and the preachinge of the ſame (for the which the Doctors and Paſtours be ordayned in the Church, 1. Cor. 4. 1. Cor. 1▪
                      and

not to Sacrifice Hebr. 10 a newe Ieſus Chriſte, or to bring in a ſtraunge Language among the common 2. Cor. 4. people) maketh heretikes. But on the contrarie, there is none other meane or way in the worlde, to driue awaye all hereſies 2. rimo. 3.. And whoſoeuer taketh awaye or letteth the readyng of the Scripture, taketh awaye incontinent the onelie meanes of conſolation Roman. 15.

                  FOurthly we ſaye, that as this exteryour preaching of the Goſpell is a ſauour or odour of death to the Rebels, whych harden them ſelues, lyke wyſe is it the ſauour or odour of lyfe to the children of God, 1. Corin.

Corin. 13 but becauſe the holie Ghoſte of whoſe office we ſpeake, is ſerued with this externall Preachinge, as with a trunke or conduite, which entreth and pearſeth vnto the verie depthe of the ſpirite, as ſayth the Apoſtle, Hebre. 4.

Wherfore we be contented & ſatiſfyed with thoſe which God hath promiſed vs and appoynted by his worde.
                  The ſecond, that where the worde is not preached and expounded in thadminiſtration of the ſacraments, but onely lyfted vp & miniſtred in an vnknowen language and mingled with the inuention of mans brayne▪ there muſt néedes be an horrible pollution, and prophanation of the holie Sacraments of our Lorde God.
               
               
                  
                  34. VVhich thinges be common to the preaching of the worde and to the ſacramentes.
                  IT is neceſſarie to vnderſtand and knowe what it is that the ſimple worde of GOD hath in common with the Sacramentes, and lykewiſe, the difference betwéene theſe two inſtrumentes.
                  Firſt, both theſe two inſtrumentes doo ſerue the holie Ghoſte to one ende, that is to ſaye, to vnite and knytte vs nearer and nearer to Ieſus Chriſte to receyue our ſaluation Roma. 4. 1. Cor. 10.
                  Secondlie, the holie Ghoſte is ſerued with both thoſe inſtrumentes, and yet doth not cōmunicate or impart to them his vertue, but all the vertue ſpringeth from him onely Roma. 2.
                  Thirdly, as we haue ſayd before, the word ſerueth vs to no purpoſe, except it be preached intelligibly, and as it maye1. Cor. 2. be vnderſtande: and further except that which it declareth & repreſenteth to vs,

that is to ſay. Ieſus Chriſt with all his goodneſſe, be receyued by the fayth of thoſe which heare it. Alſo the ſame ought to be vnderſtand by ye ſacramēts, that is to ſaye, if we bring not fayth, which is the onelie meanes to receyue that which is preached to vs repreſented and offered by the ſame word, much leſſe doo they ſerue vs to ſaluation. But contrarywiſe, in deſpyſing them by our incredulitie, and reiecting that goodnes which god offereth with the ſame to vs. wée ſeale our owne condempnation Auguſtine 13. hom vp on Ihon. 1.

                     Secondlye there is a dyfference betwene theſe twoo thinges (as it appeareth by that whyche hath béene ſayde before.) For the worde maye be mynyſtred wythout Sacramentes, Auguſt. in the queſtions vpon

                  Thyrdelye, for aſmuche as wythoute fayth we haue no parte wyth Ieſus Chriſte, and ſo conſequentlye wythout fayth we haue no part in the kingdome of heauen, Rom. 14. d Iohn. 3. d Hebre. 11. b for the preachinge of the worde is the onely ordinary meane wherwith the holye ghoſt is ſerued, to create in vs true faythe, as wee haue ſhewed here before according as ſainte Paule Roma. 10. c ſayth, that fayth commeth by hearynge.
                  
                     Wherupon we conclude that the preachyng of the worde of God is the onely neceſſarye meane to ſaluation, for thoſe which be within age of diſcretion, except it pleaſe God to worke extraordynarilye in the harte of ſome one, and ſo hath not the vſe of the Sacramentes. But to bring for the fruite, true faythe muſt go before, as we haue declared Hebre. 11. b and he y• hath faith hath attayned to Ieſus Chriſte, and conſequentlye eternal life: Iohn. 6. c It foloweth neceſſarilye that firſt we muſt haue title and right to eternal life, before we can diſcerne rightlye the Actes. 4. g &. 8. g. &. 10 Sacramentes. But thoſe which haue fayth, and yet haue not the meanes to be partakers of the Sacramentes, ſhall not be depriued nor excluded from ſaluation. For the neceſſitie of the Sacramentes extended not ſo farre as to exclude thoſe out from eternall life which cannot enioye the vſe thereof, but thus farre to hym that deſpiſeth them, which no doubt is an act of infidelitie, & worthye of damnation, if he reknowledge

not his fault. As S. Bernard hath very well declared, Bernarde in the. 77. epiſtle to Hugo S. Vic

                  Fourthly, for as much as the ſimple word preached, toucheth but one of our ſences, but the Sacramentes touche more as the ſighte and other corporall ſences, and alſo be diſtributed with expreſſe Ceremonies, and of greate ſignification: So it is eaſie to be perceiued how neceſſarye it is to vs, the vſe of the Sacramentes to encreaſe & entertayne our fayth S.

                  36 Howe there is but two Sacramentes in the Chriſtian Church.
                  IN this maner and ſignificatiō we fynd but two Sacraments ordeined of God, for y• perpetuall vſe of all his Churche: as alſo S. Auguſtine Auguſt. 3. booke of Chriſtian doctrine. 100. qu

That is to ſay, the holy Baptiſme, which ſucceaded the Circumciſion, and the holye Supper which ſucceded the paſcall lambe. For in theſeS. Ambroſo in the tract. of Sacraments. two Sacramentes bee repreſented to vs our full and perfecte ſaluation, and in this reſpect ſucceded not onelye a part of the aunciente Sacramentes but all in general. For the plainer vnderſtanding hereof wee wyll ſpeake fyrſte of them

                  27. The foure pointes vvhiche be to be conſidered in the declaration of this matter.
                  THere be foure principall poynctes which we cōſidar in the ſacraments
                  The firſte is concerning the ſignes
                  The ſeconde that which is ſignified by them.
                  The thyrd the coniunctiō of the ſignes and the things ſingnified
                  The fourth touching the manar by the which they participate as well the ſignes as the thinges ſignified.
               
               
                  38. The firſt point is to vnderſtand what we doe meane by the name of ſigne, in this matter of Sacramentes, and wherefore the Lorde did choſe for ſignes the moſt vulgar and common thinges.
                  COncernyng that whyche we call ſigne, we mean not by that word a bare ſigne, naked and empty, as a thynge repreſented or paynted by a

Paynter, or ſome other ſimple memorial, but we vnderſtand of ſignes which repreſenteth to vs moſte great and excellent thinges, declared effectuallie in the liuely word of God, as hereafter we ſhall declare. Alſo in theſe Sacraments bée offered ſpirituallie and veritablie thoſe thinges which be outwardlie repreſented by them. Moreouer, it is to be noted that we doo comprehende vnder the name of ſignes, not onely the materiall thinges of the Sacraments, as the water of Baptiſme, the breade and w

                      in the ſupper, but beſide the word ioyned with the ſignes (which declareth the wyll of God in vs, being preached and expounded plainlie) we vnderſtand furthermore by the name of ſygnes, the Ceremonies ordayned of God in all this myſterie, the which haue no leſſe ſignification then the materyall thinges, to th

ſpirituall of theyr owne nature, but by the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt. For water of his nature is made to waſh when we wyll wette vs with it. Breade and wyne is to nouriſhe the bodye beynge eaten & dronken. But in the Sacramentes theſe thinges haue another purpoſe clean contrary, as we ſhal ſay▪ hereafter We may vſe a ſimilitud for yt better vnderſtāding hereof.

                  NOtwithſtanding ſuch coniunction, we confounde not the ſignes with the thing ſignified, nor aboliſh the

ſubſtaunce of the ſignes, but make a diſtinction of that which is conioyned.
               
               
                  94. The maner to communicate aſwel the ſignes of the Sacramentes as the thing ſignifyed.
                  FOr aſmuch as the ſigne and the thing ſignified (as we haue ſaid) be ſo knyt and ioyned together & yet neuertheleſſe not confounded the one wt the other▪ but a diſtinction betweene thē, concerning y• exterior & outwarde ſigne it is receiued by a corporal & natural maner, aſwel of y• faithful as y• vnfaithful, but to diuers ends & purpoſes. For the faithful receiuinga Iere. 4 booke chap. 13 the thing ſignified wt the ſigne, do perceyue augmentation and encreaſe of theyr faith vnto ſaluation & eternal life. But the vnfaythfull not receyuing but the bare ſigne onely, receyue it to theyr condemnation: becauſe that refuſing the thing ſignifyed which is offered to them of God with the ſigne, they polute & diſhonor it, as much as in them is. Thus much concerning the communicating of the ſigne. But concerning the thing ſignifyed,

which is Ieſus Chriſte with all his benefits and goodneſſe: We haue already declared, that the onely meane to cōmunicate with hym is by true fayth. And therfore he that bringeth not true fayth cannot receyue hym, but he that bryngeth fayth, receyueth him truelye & effectuallye, but not with teeth, nor by the bellye after a corporall manner but ſpirituallye by fayth Ciprianſermon of the ſupper of the Lord Auguſtine vpon Iohn 25. treatiſe Origen vp on Math. 11. ca. 15. embraſing that which God promiſeth vs by his worde, and offreth to vs by the exteriour ſigne, or to ſpeake yet more properly, in ioyenynge our ſelues more nerer then we were before vnto Ieſus Chriſt.

                  THe ſigne of Baptiſme in water, the ſubſtaunce of the ceremonies agréeing with the Scripture (to the which maye not bee added or diminiſhed without ſacriledge) bee theſe: the parſon is weat with water, and then the water tarieth a certain ſpace, before it be cleane dried or paſſed a way, and finallye the water vaniſheth and conſumeth.
                  The thing ſignified and verely repreſented, Actes. 22 Roma. 6 1. Cori. 6 Epheſ. 5 Titus. 3 1. Peter. 3 Galat 3 Colo. 2 is the aſperſion or ſprinkling of the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt in remiſſion of all our ſins, & imputation of righteouſnes. Alſo by the exterior wetting with water is ſignified y• mortification & ſepulture or burying of our olde man, that is to ſaye of our natural corruption, dead & buried by the bertue of the death & burying of Ieſus Chriſt, is ſignified by this, that the perſon is wet, & continueth vnder the water, or the water vpon him a certain time. And

finallye the generation of the new man with a certayne and ſure hope of the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, is ſignifyed by this, that he which is Baptiſed, commeth out of the water clean purged and waſhed.
                  Beſyde this Baptiſme is an exteryour and ſolemne profeſſion of the Chriſtian religion by the which wee all doe bynde our ſelues to accept and take Ieſus Chriſte for our onelye Sauiour 1.

                  The accorde and agreement of that ſygne is moſt proper and méete becauſe the water is the element moſt conuenient of all thyngs, to waſhe and putte

                  48. For what cauſes the younge children of the faythfull be baptiſed.
                  COncernynge younge Children, becauſe theyr fayth is vnknowne to vs, and we haue ſayde before, it is requiſite that they be partakers of the fruites of the ſacraments Actes. 
                           •
                        
                     , and it is not

very likely that they haue faith, becauſe they haue not the vſe of vnderſtanding, Deut. 1 Roma. 10 excepte God do worke in them extraordinarilye, the which appeareth not to vs, neuertheleſſe we ceaſe not to communicate to them Baptiſme.
                  Fyrſte, for as much as there is now the ſame cauſe in Baptiſme which was ſometyme in Circumciſion, which is called by S. Paule, the ſeale of ryghteouſneſſe which is by fayth Roma. 4: and alſo by expreſſe commaundement of God, the male children were marked the eyghte day Geneſ. 17.
                  Secondlye, there is a ſpeciall regard to be had to the infantes of the faythful. For although they haue not faith in effecte ſuche as thoſe haue that be of age, yet ſo it is, that they haue the ſeede and the ſpring, in vertue of the promiſe which was receyued and apprehended by theyr elders. For God promiſeth not vs onely to be our God, if we beleeue in him, but alſo y• he wil be the God of our ofſpring and ſeede, yea vnto the thouſand

degrees Gene. 17 Exod. 20, that is to the laſt ende. Therfore ſayde S. Paule that the chyldren of the faythfull be ſanctified from their mothers wombe 1 Cori. 7. By what right or title then do they refuſe to geue them the marke and ratification of that thing which they haue and profeſſe alreadye? And if they alledge yet further, that although they come of faithfull elders or parents, it followeth not that they be of the number of the electe, and by conſequent that they be ſanctifyed. (For God hath not choſen al the children of Abraham and Iſaac Roma. 7.) The anſwer is eaſy to bee made, that it is true all thoſe bee not of the kingdome of God, which bee borne of Faythfull parents, but of good right we leaue this ſecret to God for to iudge, which onelye knoweth 2. Tim. 2 it, yet notwithſtanding we preſume iuſtly to be the children of God, all thoſe which bee iſſued and diſcended from faythfull Parents, according to the promyſe Gene. 17 1. Cori. 7. For as much as it appeareth not to vs the contrary. According to the ſame we

baptiſe the younge children of the faithfull, as they haue vſed and done from the Apoſtels tyme in the Churche of god Origen▪ 5 booke vpon the epiſtle to the Rom., and we dout not but god by thys marke (ioyned with the prayers of the Church which is there aſſiſtant) doth ſeale the adoption and election in thoſe which he hath predeſtinate eternallye, whether they dye before they come to age of diſcretiō: or whether they liue to bringe forth the fruits of their faith, in due time and according to the meanes which god hath ordeyned:
               
               
                  49. Application of all that goeth before of the Sacrament of the Supper and the right vſe thereof.
                  THe ſignes of the ſacrament of the Supper be bread and wine. The ſubſtanciales ceremonies, accordinge to this holy worde (to the whiche no man hath anye more power to adde or diminiſhe, then to make new promiſes of newe Sacramentes) Math. 29 Mark. 14 Luke. 25 1. Cor. 11 be concerninge the minyſter, who repreſenting

Ieſus Chriſt, after the rehearſinge and expounding the ordinaunce of the lord, with inuocation and publyke prayers, then to breake the bread and diſtribute to the people, and lykewyſe the cuppe. Alſo for thoſe which receyue the ſupper, with the miniſter particulerlye in hys office it is for them to take, eate, and drinke: and finallye altogether to render thankes with one hart and with one monthe.
                  The thing ſignified is the ſame which the doctrine preſenteth and declareth to vs ordinarily. And of Baptiſme likewyſe▪ that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt 1. Cor. 10 conceyued, borne, crucified, dead, buryed, ryſen, aſcended into heauen, to be made for vs the entrie and perfecte ſapience, righteouſnes, ſanctification and redemption. 1. Corin. 1 So thē we doubt not but according to the promiſe of our God, the verye body and the very blood of the Lord▪ that is to ſay Ieſus Chriſt himſelf, with all his goodnes and treaſures, is offered to vs verily and withoute fraude, to be

receyued of vs inwardly in fayth, by the vertue of the holye Ghoſte, into euerlaſting life, euen as verely as is offered to our outwarde ſences the breade and the wyne, for our corporall ſuſtenaunces and lyfe, whiche for this cauſe is called the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, that is to ſay, they be the very exterior ſignes and corporall markes, of that which the Lord offereth ſpirituallye on his parte, that is to ſay, of the very body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt: For it is an accuſtomable maner of ſpeaking in the matter of the Sacramentes, to geue to the ſigne the name of the thing ſignified by it. As it is ſayde, that the Cup is the new alyaunce Luke. 22 or couenaunt, that is to ſay: the marke and true ſigne of the new couenaunt, which is made by the ſheddyng of the precious bloode of Ieſus Chriſte. So is ſayd alſo that the Circumciſion is called the alliaunce Gene. 17, that is to ſaye the very ſigne and ratifycation of the alliaunce. Alſo the Lambe is the paſſage Math. 26 Mark. 14 Luke. 23, or paſſeouer. Item the ſtone in the Deſert

was Chriſt 1. Cor 10, that is to ſay: verely repreſenting Chriſt. Alſo it is ſayd of S. Paul concerning this matter, 1. Cor. 10 that the breade is the communion of the bodye of Chriſte, that is to ſaye: the true ſigne or gage of the communion which we haue with Chriſt. And this expoſition is not forged by vs, but expreſſely and playnely obſerued by all the auncient Doctours of the Churche, as foloweth: in that the bread is broken, is repreſēted to our ſenſes the paſſion of our Lorde, which was broken with dolour and ſorrowes of death, and the iudgement of God in his bodye and ſoule for vs. In that it is diſtributed, and the cup lykewyſe to all the Communicantes, repreſenteth to our ſenſes, that Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe with all his treaſures and benefites is geuen to vs of God the Father into eternall lyfe.

in theyr tyme: yet notwithſtanding all thinges to be ruled by the worde of God▪ and conſider dilligentlye what thinges are expedient to be reteyned or to be altered for the edifycation of the Church: For in matter of policye, euerye man knoweth well that all thynges bee not conuenient in all tymes nor in al places, marke I ſaye, this is it that wee haue alwayes required, and we yet earneſtly require it: But ſeing the negligence of manye, and the ſmall hope that we haue to bee prouided for in a generall or common conſent: force hath conſtrained certrine princes & Lordes, hauing knowen and ſeene the common diſorders, to prouide and ſette orders in theyr owne countreyes as we doe ſée. Now they doe not well that fyll the eares of Prynces, that we be ſedicious perſones and Heretickes, and that wee allowe no counſelles nor ordinaūces of the Church, which bee manifeſt ſlaunders and falſe rumours, as yee maye perceiue it ye will geue vs hearynge as appertayneth,

and not to make our enterparties and enemyes Iudges of our owne cauſes.

                  WE require fyrſte that there bee put a difference betweene the true Church and that whiche is not, although they borrowe this name: And alſo betwéene thoſe whiche bee in ſuche wiſe wythin the Churche, as they bee alſo of the Churche: and of thoſe whiche bee not of the Churche although, they bee in the Churche. For it is moſt certaine, that Sathan deſyreth and is buſied to worke ſo, that his Synagog bee eſteemed for the true Churche: and ſo longe as the Church ſtriueth here on earth, it is certayne and ſure that the chaffe ſhall bee medled amongſt the good grayne Math. 13. 1.

But God according to hys incomprehenſible wiſedome, in puniſhing the ingratitude of the worlde, ſometimes withdraweth and taketh from vs parte of his light, in ſuche wiſe, that ſometyme it ſéemeth that the Churche is at an ende or deſtroyed as we ſée it happened in Iſraell in the time that Chryſt came into this worlde. (For ſet the Iewes aparte, there was not one trace or ſteppe of the true markes of the Churche in the worlde.

Alſo we may ſée howe it is come to paſſe in our time, that there is no people in the worlde more abuſed, than thoſe whyche wold knit and tie the church to a certaine place, and to the ſucceſſion of thoſe, which they call byſhoppes, which in very déede be nothing leſſe, both by the word of God and by the auncient canons. Whereby it is eaſy to ſhew that from the hed of them al to the ſmalleſt, thei be excōmunicated & cut off from ye church, if they change not their life and māners. Nowe the duty of the childrē of god is not only to ſerue god, in what place ſoeuer they be, or whatſoeuer ruin or decay there be in the Church, but when it ſhall pleaſe God to eſtabliſhe and build vp again her ruines & decayes, eyther here or in any other place, not being bounde to anye people or Nation, whatſoeuer they bo: but when it pleaſeth him to ſet vp again his ſtandard, whiche is ye miniſtration of his holy word: ye duety I ſaye of ye children of God, is to ioyne themſelues to the true flocke, & ſeparate themſelues from thoſe which be not.

And ſaincte Auguſtine ſayth, the churche ought not to bee preferred before Ieſus Chriſt.

A counſel lawfully aſſembled, if we conſyder the outewarde ſucceſſion and appearaunce. Who concluded, that thoſe whyche were baptyſed by Heretykes, ſhoulde bée rebaptyſed? A Councell of Affrica, where as was ſainct Cyprian.

                  BEhold here how the lawfull counſels ought to be aſſembled, without reſpect to any thing, ſaue onely to the honour of God, and the edification of the churches. As I do vnderſtand & haue learned by the holy ſcripture, and by reading of the moſte auncient eccleſiaſticall authors. Let vs come now to conſider how farre extendeth the authoritie of a Counſell lawfullye aſſembled. We ſaye that a Chriſtian counſell ſhall not be aſſembled, nor neuer ought to aſſemble, to make any newe article of our faith. And that for. ii. reaſons. The firſt is, becauſe it appertayneth to God onely to declare what and how daungerous it is to ſyn againſt him, and what

is ſynne, and what is not. Brieflie, it is he onely which hath power ouer our cō
                     ſcience, and vppon our fayth, ſo that no man can vſurpe his office, but hée wyll (after a maner to ſaye) driue God out of his ſeate Coloſ. 2. 1. Cor.

Firſt by viſions & other meanes as it pleaſed him, & after by Moyſes and by the Prophetes, Preachers & publiſhers of that doctrine whiche was geuen and alſo written by Moyſes: who Hebr. 1. Deute. 21. expreſſely forbiddeth to adde or diminiſh any thing Deut. 4. Eſai. 1.. Much leſſe then it is lawfull to alter or chaunge Hebr. 2. 1. Cor. 11. any thing. Finally, Ieſus Chriſte at his comming▪ hath fullye and perfectlye declared to vs the wyll of his Father, leauing out nothyng Iohn. 15. Hebr. 1.. Alſo aſcendyng from vs into heauen (concerning his corporall preſence) dyd geue his holye ſpirite in ſuch meaſure to his Apoſtles, and other godly perſonnes which were ſtyrred vp, that they dyd vnderſtande all

trueth Iohn. 14., the whiche they haue preached and wrytten to the entent to put backe and preuent Sathan, that he ſhould not abuſe the world with his lyes ſo eaſelie.

and had not written but halfe or a part, what aſſuraunce had there bene in their doctrine? And as S. Auguſtine ſpeaking of the Traditions whiche they call Apoſtolikes: If Ieſus Chriſt had kept backe any thing from vs, who coulde ſaye it is this, or that? Or if any ſhould ſay it, how could he proue it? we conclude then that it is open and manifeſt blaſphemye againſt the auctoritie of Ieſus Chriſt, the onely eſpouſe, Lord 1. Cor. 8. 2. Cor. 11.

Briefe it is to reuerſe and ouerturne the foundation of the Churche, to eſtéeme and thinke that it were lawfull to men whatſoeuer they were, to put to or take from that doctrine, contayned in the holie ſcripture Gala. 1. 1. Cor. 1.. But here ye maye ſée what hath cauſed oftentimes y• faithfull to aſſemble and come together.

Brieflye, they dyd not aſſemble to ſtabliſhe and confirme the ſcriptures, the which be grounded and ſtabliſhed vpon the eternall trueth of God, and ſhal continue for euer: but for to confirme them ſelues by the ſcriptures againſt Satan and his adherentes. So then we beléeue the holy church, not as the foundation of the Scriptures 1. Corin. 3., but grounded vpon the doctrine of y• ſcriptures, which be pure and the onelye trueth Actes. 17. 1. Theſ. 5. 1. Iohn. 4., ſo that for this cauſe the Church is called by S. Paul, and with good right the pyller and ſtay of the trueth 1. Tim. 3..

                      it is to be ſéen in the Actes of the auncient counſel. For of neceſſitie al things muſt be done in the Church of God by good order 7. Cor. 10. as S. Paule ſayde. But this may not be, but when neceſſities do happen. But of this let vs mark well the poyntes which folow.
               
               
                  18 The fyrſt poynt to conſider the caſe well, when or at what tyme they should ſet vp politike lawes in the Church.
                  FIrſt there ought to be put great difference betwene the doctrine of ſaluation, and thoſe things which they eſtabliſh onely for to kéepe the ciuill order required in the church. For the doctrine vnder the which alſo we doo comprehende the Sacraments, do teach the conſcience, & dependeth not vpon man, who is bounde to mayntaine it, vnder paine of damnation, without chaūging, putting to, or dyminiſhing any thing, in no manner of wiſe, as we haue declared

heretofore: but the canonicall ordinaunces concerning the manner of doing, is all exterior and outwardlye, according to the cyrcumſtances of places, tymes and perſons: by reaſon whereof they can neyther be perpetuall nor vniuerſall without exception.
                  For ſuch order and faſhion maye be holden in one place, which can nor maye in no wyſe bee vſed in another place. Such thing alſo is good in one place, or in one time, which ſhoulde be vnprofitable or domageable in another. And for this cauſe there is often tymes contrariety among ye Canons, as it was néedefull to haue reſpect to thoſe which were expedient. For as much then as ſuch ordinaunces be mutable, and made by man, it followeth that they concerne not the conſcience, but in caſes of ſlaunder and dyſorder which ſhoulde bee a let or ſtoppe of the purpoſe for the whiche they were ſet vp, that is to ſaye, the edification and quietnes of the Church, as for example. It was agreed vpon

in Ieruſalem by the Counſell where the Apoſtles were, that the onelye grace of God iuſtifieth vs by faith: againſt thoſe which woulde ioyne the Ceremonies of the lawe, with the Sacrifices of Ieſus Chriſte. And moreouer, fornication is forbidden Actes. 15.. Beholde a doctrine which was not newly ſet vp by the authoritie of the Counſell, but with good ryght approued by this aſſemble. For as much as it is the true doctrine reuealed to the worlde from the begynning, and confyrmed by all the preachynges and writinges of the Prophetes.

muſt alſo be a reſpect that the Miniſters of God ve not deſpiſed: and on the contrary not to extol them into Gods place nor ſet them in his ſteede, as men do often times. Yea euen thoſe which be nothynge leſſe then the Miniſters of God, how ſhall we do then? Let vs follow S.

                  THe thyrde poynte lyeth in thys which S. Paule ioyneth in y• ſame text, the whiche is required alſo on the Miniſters parte, that euerie of them be found faithfull 1. Cor. 4.. Now we accoumpt not them for faithfull, and ſo by conſequent worthye of the honour due to the miniſters Roma. 6. Galath. 5. 1. Iohn. 1. 1. Tim. 5., nor yet to be accepted as miniſters Philip. 3. 1. Timo. 6., which haue not receyued ye office and charge of the Lord, that is to ſay thoſe which haue bene thruſte in without conſent, as is appoynted by the

Church. And namely when the Lord geueth this grace in the worlde, that there is a Churche erected, (excepte God doth ſtur vp ſome one or two extraordinaryly, as he hath alwayes done when it ſéemeth good to him). For howe ſhall they preache ſayth Saynt Paule, if they bée not ſente Roma. 10. Ierem. 2. 3.? And to ſaye trueth what earthly Prince is there that woulde allowe thoſe thinges within his Realme, which bee done without his commaundement?
                  Wherefore we doo exhort all faithfull to take dillygent heede and beware of thoſe whiche contempne the ordynarie meanes of a lawfull and godly election, which importeth a true and free examination of manners, learning, and doctrine without ambition or wicked meanes, whenſoeuer it ſhal pleaſe God to erect his order in any place of the world. For when this order by gods iuſt iudgemēt cānot be kept, it wilbe folly to hope for any reformation confirmed by them who be the very enemies of the Church.
                  
                     Alſo all extraordinarie vocations ought to be ſuſpected, and in no wyſe to be admitted, when God hath opened the waye to ordinarie meanes, except there appeare euident and manifeſt cauſes. Alſo theſe be falſe paſtors which be not able or méete to execute the offyce and charge 1. Tim. 3. Titus. 1.. Item all ſuch as be defamed, and ſlaunderous perſons. Item thoſe which execute not their offyce and duty, for hée is no Paſtor that feedeth not his flocke.

Cor. 4., but declare their owne fantaſies or other mennes traditions in ſteede of the worde of God: all ſuch perſons I ſaye be holden and declared namely by the auncient canons for falſe paſtors and miniſters of Sathan, and not of God. Wherfore all that euer they can ſay or do contrary to this order, is in vayne and fryuelous before God, although they had fiftie crownes vpon their heads, and as

                  THe thyrde eſtate of eccleſiaſticall offices lieth in the ſpiritual iuriſdiction, ye which was committed to thoſe, who were called in the wryttinges of the Apoſtles & auncient Doctours both counſels, and canons, partycullarly preſbiter, that is to ſay, Senior or Elder, which alſo ſomtimes be called gouernours by ſaint Paule 1.

Cyprian c hath wrytten, wherein it is eaſye to gather, that the Byſhoppe proſeded and was chiefe in this companye,

not for to rule and raygne ouer them, but to doo nothyng without the aduyſe of the Church. Now this iuriſdiction lyeth not in worldlie & temporal thinges, but altogether in thoſe thinges whiche concerneth the conſcience. So that it is fully diſtinde from the offyce of a cyuill magiſtrate, according as the lord Chriſt not only ſaid to his Apoſtles, but practiſed Luke. 12. Iohn. 18. Acts. 6., and S. Paule after him 1. Cor. 10.. True it is that in the tyme when there were no magiſtrates, which made profeſſion or vowed openly to be Chriſtians, ſ. Paule would that for to eſchew ſlaunders and offences, the faythfull ſhould decyde and ende all controuerſies among themſelues when neede required, but this was but for a certaine tyme. And ſurely asf▪ 1. Cor. 6. I thinke ſuch perſons were but as arbitrers, choſen by the parties, or at the leaſt was an offyce diſtincte from thoſe which we ſpake of. Alſo it is certayne that euen vnder Chriſtian Emperours the good Byſhoppes haue beene maruelouſlie letted and troubled, about the ending

of controuerſies, but it was more for to appoynt and agree the partyes by amiable and friendlye abytrement, then to meddell the ſpyrituall Iuriſdiction with the temporall. And Saint Auguſtine ſheweth plainely in many places, how it gréeued him for that he was conſtrayned to employe, and beſtowe ſo much tyme for the importunitie of the people. All Byſhoppes haue not ſo done, but rather haue deſyred nothing more, then to ſerue theyr ambition vnder the ſhadowe of holynes, whereof it came to paſſe that the Emperours haue graunted to them more in this caſe then was needefull or appertayned to them, or the profyte of the Churche required.

                     THe cauſe and purpoſe of the eccleſiaſticall, iuriſdiction tendeth to one ende, that is to ſaye, that all the body of the Church in generall, and euery member of the ſame in particular, bee p

And that ye lawes eyther be made, touching the doctrine of ſaluation generally, that is to wéete, concerning their duetie which they owe to God and their neyghbours, or concerning the regiment or manner of doing, which euerye one ought to kéepe in his charge or office. It followeth then that this iuriſoiction ought to be deuided into two principall partes. The firſt is concerning the authoritie to ordayne & appoint thoſe thinges whiche concerne as well doctrine and manners, as the regiment which euery one ought to kéepe in his degrée. The ſecond in the puniſhing of thoſe which offend, in the obſeruation

of any of theſe two things, But concerning the firſt parte, which lyeth in the power to decrée or ordayne, we haue alreadye declared here aboue, that God hath receyued to him ſelfe, fully and entirelye to preſeribe lawes pertayning to the conſcience, for vs to walke in them vprightly before God and man. Wherfore there reſteth no more but the other part, which concerneth the diſcipline and regimēt which is required, that all thinges be done by good order, as we haue treated amply in ſpeaking of the authority of the body of the Church.
               
               
                  34 VVhat is the office of the Elders in the Church.
                  IT is the office of the Elders principally to watche, that the Church whiche is committed to them, begouerned by good order, according to the rule of the Goſpel, and that the eccleſiaſticall lawes and ordinaunces, eyther vniuerſall or particular, be mayntained and executed dilygentlye, accordinge to

their charge. And if there ſhall happen any new inconuenience, their duty is to prouide therefore by newe ordinaunces & iniunctions conformable to the Chriſtian religion & charitie: Without burdening of mens conſcience, neyther to charge the Churche with a multitude of lawes, nor brynging in ſuperſtition according to that which hath beene ſayde herebefore, where it ſpeaketh of coūſels, eyther to be done by thēſelues, or to take the aduiſe and counſel of other churches, and the ſayd lawes and ordinances to be incontinent allowed & auctoriſed by the magiſtrate, if ſo be that he be a Chriſtiā. And for this cauſe in all the prymatiue Churche they haue beene accuſtomed to holde prouinciall ſynodes twiſe a yeare. It is their office lykewiſe when any peryl or daūger doth happen among them, to appoynt prayers & faſting extraordinarilye, & to practiſe & vſe them in theyr churches, when any ſuch chaūces do happen with the conſent of ye Chriſtian magiſtrate if there be any: ſo that the godly

orders of the church may be maintained wt diſcipline. And aboue al things let the word of god be diligētly & ſincerely preached, wt the ſacraments truly miniſtred, ye eccleſiaſtical goods wel gouerned, & althings wel ordred. Their duty is alſo to elect men méete for the ſame: I ſay elect, for it cānot be found that euer ther was any other lawful, eccleſiaſtical vocation in the Chriſtian Churche, ſynce it was brought into any good order of gouernement, but by the way of ellection, except God called any extraordinarily, without ordinary meanes. Now concerning the election that it may be lawful, behold the pointes which we conſider therin. Firſt who ought to bee electours, what perſons ought to be elected, and howe they ought to elect, and howe to confirme the election.

reaſonable in the Churche of God, that be which ſhoulde ſerue a Churche, already erected, can bee elected without the good wyll of the ſame Actes. 14.. Yet neuertheles according to the places and the conditions of the people, it is requiſyte that the eccleſiaſticall gouernours haue fyrſt a reſpect to thoſe and appoynt moſt méeteſt, & then to aduertyſe the people who oftentymes the greateſt parte be ignoraunt who are méeteſt for them Acts. 1.. And in the primatyue Churche it happened ſometyme that good Byſhoppes haue named thoſe which they deſyred to haue for theyr ſucceſſors, but it was without reſpecte of their owne priuate or partycular affections. And this nomination was none otherwyſe then a declaration of theyr opinyon, which incontinent after was conſydered and examyned by the whole Church Reade the actes of the counſell holden at rome in the tyme of Pope Hilarie., as we ſee by the example of S. Auguſtin Epiſt. 110., and of Anaſtaſius Theodorete in the eccleſiaſticall hiſtory. 4. lib. c. 20.. Moreouer the eccleſiaſticall rulers ought to take order, to preuent all things which may be a let or hyndrance

that the election be not fréelye done as it appertayneth. And firſt to be authoriſed by the Chriſtian magiſtrate, when God ſhall appoynt him after by good delyberation and admonitions.

                  40 Of the ſecōd part of the ecclaſiaſticall iuriſdiction, concerning correction.
                  THe ſeconde parte of the offyce of the eccleſiaſticall Senators, is to reproue thoſe which breede trouble in y• church, wherin it is to be noted: Fyrſt, the maner to puniſhe which the Churche vſeth, is contrary to the ciuyll puniſhments. For the Church vſeth no priſonmentes, nor amerciamentes with money, nor corporal paines, but onely with

the pure word of God, as it ſhalbe ſayde hereafter Luke. 22 Iohn. 18. 2. Cor. 10.. And if the apoſtles did at any time procéede with corporall paines Acts. 5, it was by an extraordinary power becauſe that at y• tyme, there was no Chriſtian magiſtrate. Secondly, all the eccleſiaſtical cauſes maye bée deuided into thrée kindes, the one concerning the doctrine: The other concernynge the manners of Chriſtians, the thyrde touchinge the order which al men ought to kéepe in their eſtate, accordinge to the eccleſiaſticall lawe. Concerning the doctrine, they maye fayle and erre by Ignorance, or by malyce, or by thē both. Alſo malyce bringeth foorth his fruytes accordinge to his quantitie, and according to that artycle of faith which it enuyeth againſt. In all ſuch caſes, firſt there muſt be vſed y• moſt eaſieſt meanes. As in teaching the ignoraunt, and reprouing the faulte of thoſe whiche offende by malyce or purpoſe, accordynge to the quallytie and greatneſſe of theyr offence, and ſo to beare with them, if it bee poſſible to wynne

them by admonitions, both particularly and publikely, & alſo to call them before the eccleſiaſticall ſenators, if it be needefull. Not to confound them but to bring thē againe into ye right way, if it be poſſible Roma, 14. and. 15. Epheſ. 4. 1. Timo. 2.. If al this wil not ſerue, then they muſt procede to the laſtremedy which is againſt the ſtubborn and incorrigible, of the which we ſhall ſpeake hereafter.
                  Concerning behauour & maners there ought to be a difference betwene the offences commytted againſt a particular perſon, and publike offences, & betweene the offences which be publikely committed. And alſo he which enforceth himſelf to doo euyll, who deſerueth to be otherwiſe dealt with all then he which is fallen by humane infirmitie.
                  Concerning particular faults, or wher the offence is not manifeſt, our Sauior Chriſte hath ſet an order which ought to be kept in all degrées Math. 18.. Concerning publike offences, S. Paul wylleth that they ſhould be reproued publikely 1. Timo. 5. for to redreſſe the ſlaunder, and alſo practyſed it

him ſelfe in reprouing S. Peter Galath. 2.. If the moſt eaſieſt meanes can profite, it ſufficeth: if not they muſt procéede frō degrée to degrée, vntyl they come to the laſt remedy Math. 18. 1. Cori. 5. 1. Tim. 6. 1. Timo. 4. Titus. 3. 2. Iohn. 2. 1. The

As for offences which concerne the eccleſiaſticall order, there be aūcient canons ordayned, from degrée to degrée, yet neuertheles the rygour ought to bee moderated, and out of them to choſe thoſe which bee moſt connenient for to edifie.
               
               
                  41 vvhat excommunication is, & what the right vſe thereof is.
                  THe eccleſiaſticall corrections hath to degrées, the firſte is admonition. Sometime eaſye and ſometime ſharpe, according as the offēce of the caſe requyreth. The ſecond and laſt degrée is that we call excommunication, wherin muſt be noted the poynt folowing.
                  Firſt what is excommunication? We cal excōmunication 1. Cor. 9. a ſentence wherby

the eccleſiaſticall Seniors after lawfull knowledge of the cauſe, dooth declare in the name and authoritie of God and his holy word, that ſuch or ſuch, one or many be iuſtlye excluded and ſeperated from ye company or communion of the Saynts that is to ſay ye Church of God, & by conſequent delyuered to ſathan, for aſmuch as without the Church there is no ſaluation: yet not to continue for euer, but ſo long as they continue vnreformed, and vntil that they haue ſatiſfied for the ſlander or offence geuen.
                  Secondly, it muſt be vnderſtande that ſuch a power is not groūded vpon man, for man hath no manner of power ouer the ſoule, but by the authoritye of God, who vſeth them in the Churche as organes and inſtrumentes by whome hee ſpeaketh, & therefore it is not to be doubted, but ſuch ſentences be ratified and confyrmed in heauen. For as muche as Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo ſayde and promiſed to all his church in the perſon of hys xii. Apoſtles, vnder the name of keies of the

kingdome of heauen Math. 18. and to bynde and vnbinde, as alſo S. Paule practiſed the lyke with the Churche of Corinthe and others 1. Cori. 5. 1. Timo. 1. Yet neuertheles, the Churche ought after lawful ſatiſfactiō, to receyue him again which hath bene caſt out, that is to ſaye, if afterward be ſhall ſatiſfy to the Church, & make amends for the publyke offence, according to the ordinaunce of the Church & ſufficient proofes had of true amendment, as farre foorth as man may iudge. And there is no doubte but ſuch abſolutary ſentence is ratifyed and confirmed in heauen 2. Cor. 2. Ciprian, 1. booke. 2. Epiſtle, and 1. booke. 14. Epiſtle &. 16.
                  Thirdly it is to be noted diligently that ſuch authoritie neuer pertayneth to one man alone (except God worketh at any tyme extraordinarilye) but to the whole eccleſiaſticall ſenate Math. 18. 1. Cori. 5..
                  Fourthly, this is not geuen to al thoſe whiche call them ſelues of the Churche, but to the true eccleſiaſtical ſenate lawfullye and cannonicallye elected, as wee haue ſayde for to gouerne the affayres of the Church.
                  
                     The fift poynt is, y• the very true eccleſiaſticall ſenate, cannot, nor may not vſe it at their wyls, as we ſee al men be ſubiect to many infirmities. But this power is lymitted & appointed by the worde of God. And for this cauſe Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles deſpiſed the excommunications of the Scrybes & Phariſees Iohn. 16. and. 10. And according to ye ſame, Irene a moſt auncient Biſhop of Lyons, reproued verye ſharplye the temerious excommunication which Victor Biſhoppe of Rome made, about the yeere of God, a hundred nynetie and eight, which declareth very well what was the primatiue or firſt be gynninge of the Byſhoppes of Rome, where as then they walked in vpryght conſcience. And there were other Byſſhops y• vnderſtoode their office: and one of the cauſes that the prouincial and nationall counſels were ordained and holden for, was to heare and decide the cauſes of thoſe whiche complayned of theyr paſtors Canon. 5. c firſt counſell of Nice.. Alſo it appeareth ſufficiently thorowout the whole eccleſiaſticall hyſtorye,

howe the Byſhoppes in theſe caſes ought to helpe one another to edyfye without ambition. Beſide this the Metropolitans ought to be content thē
                     ſeues with their lymites, and ought to doo nothyng without the deuiſe of theyr brethrē in their Iuriſdiction Canon. 116. of the fyrſt Counſell of Nice, and. 9 Counſell of Antioche.. But ambition hath ſo wrought, that of longe tyme the Biſhops of the principall townes, (and aboue all hée of Rome) hath drawn all to themſelues: witneſſeth the falſehood of Boniface whiche was diſcouered and reuealed at the Counſell ofThis counſel was holden at Carthage, about the yeere. 422 Carthage, where as was S. Auguſtine, where it was ordayned that thoſe of the Clergie of Affrica, which appealed ouer the ſea to Rome, ſhould be depoſed from theyr office.
                  For the ſixt poynt it is to bee noted to what end excommunication was ordayned of God. Firſt that the church of God ſhoulde he as pure as might be poſſyble, and that there myght be no occaſion to think, that it ſhould be a refuge or den of the wicked 1. Cor. 5. Secondly for feare that the

infected ſhoulde not defyle thoſe whiche were whole. 1. Cori. 5. Thirdly if it were poſſible y• the ſynner might bée brought home tol 1. Cor. 5. 2. Theſ.

It followeth then that this puniſhment muſt be applyed and vſed for to edifie, as may be expedient, and that there be good héede taken, leaſt they confounde the ſinner by too much heauynes and ſorowr, when he geueth a ſgyne of repentaunce, but ther to mitigate the puniſhment when néede ſhall require▪
                  
               
               
                  42 Of the ciuill and Chriſtiā magiſtrate and to what ende his office tendeth.
                  IT reſteth nowe to ſpeake of Magiſtrates, which bee in their eſtate the pryncipall members of the Churche ordained of God, yea namely aboue al others in their eſtate Roma, 15.. To theſe appertayneth the doing & execution of ciuyll and temporall affayres, ſo as their ſubiectes maye lyue in peace. By reaſon whereof the taxes, and ſubſidies, are due vnto them Math. 22 Roma. 13., and to them appertayneth to vſe

the ſwoord which God hath geuen thē 
                     Roma. 13., for the preſeruation aſwell of the countreyes which be committed to them, as alſo for the defence and mayntenaunce of good lawes, and puniſhment of the euyll and wicked doers. Secondlye, the duetye and offyce of the magiſtrates is not to regarde ſimplye the peace and concorde of ſubiectes, but principallye for thys ende, that the peace and concorde maye tende to the honour and glorie of God, that all men maye lyue not onelye in a certayne ciuyll honeſtye, but alſo with pyetie and true worſhyppe of God▪ as wytneſſeth Saynte Paule 1. Timo. 2.. For thys cauſe eſpeciallye it appertayneth to the Magiſtrate, that the Lawes whiche hée vſeth and executeth maye bée conformable to the wyll of God: and pryncipallye to geue order that the relygyon bee perfecte and holye, and that all the Churche bee ordered accordynge to the woorde of God, forbyddyng and punyſhynge, as the caſe requyreth,

All thoſe which trouble the Churche or concerning the diſcipline thereof. Alſo Dauid diſcribed the eſtate of a faithfull Prince Pſal. 108 and many other textes., as himſelfe hath vſed, with all thoſe which haue wyllinglye done their duetie, as Salomon, Ezechias, Ioſias & other faithful Kinges and Emperours.
               
               
                  33 Howe far they are bounde to obey the magiſtrate.
                  AS there is no faythfull man exempt from the obedience whiche be oweth to Ieſus Chriſte, reigning in his Church, be it king, prince or ſubiect, ſo ther is none from the greateſt to the leaſt which oweth not voluntarie obedyence to his Magiſtrate, as ordayned of God Roma. 13 Titus. 2. 1. Peter. 2▪
                     . Yea, although the Magiſtrate were a tirant, except in one point onelye, that is to ſaye, if he commaunde to doo things which were againſt Gods woorde. For in this caſe as the Apoſtles ſaid, we muſt rather obey God then mā, for otherwiſe we extol mē aboue God Acts. 4.

It is not then rebellion to diſobey Princes, when they woulde cauſe vs to doo that which God forbyddeth, or to defend
                        •
                      or forbyd that which God commaūdeth. But in this poynt
                        •
                      there muſt bee ſuche a meane kepte, that they doo not paſſe or excéede their vocation. For the Apoſtles obeyed not to thoſe which for bad and defended them to preach Ieſus Chriſte, as alſo they tooke to them no weapon or armour, which appertayned not to them. Alſo we muſt note, that there is difference betweene doing wrong to another and to ſuffer wrong done to vs. Nowe for the firſte, it is forbydden vs▪ neuer to doo wrong: But eſpecially commaunded vs to ſuffer the iniuryes done to vs for the honour of GOD 1. Peter. 2., as much as maye or can bee done wythout preiudice, or againſt our vocation, as we reade that Ieſus Chriſte although hee were free, neuertheleſſe payed trybute wyllynglye Math. 17. It is then a manyfeſt and falſe ſlaunder to ſaye, that the doctrine which we teach and vſe bringeth

men to bee ſedicious, and diſobedient to kinges and ſuperious. But cleane contrarie, the Goſpell eſtabliſheth their power. But this is impudently done of thoſe which haue notoriouſly exempted themſelues from the ſubiection of Princes, & which do vnderſtand no otherwiſe by the lyberties of the Church, then that which they haue vſurped vpon Princes, againſt all right both diuine & humaine: and yet haue no ſhame to burdē vs with that wherin they them ſelues be notory

                  And moreouer they ſhall fynde thoſe men to abuſe them ſelues verye muche, which thinke that our dyfference onelye lyeth in certayne lyght abuſes concerning

And to declare the ſame, I wyll not ſtaye nor grounde mee vppon the fylthie ſtynking lyfe of thoſe of their owne Church, from the leaſt to the greateſt: But I wyll come directlie to their doctrine. And when there ſhall bee none other thinge to declare and ſhewe that theyr Relygion is proceeded from the Prince of darkneſſe, but this one that they wyll not ha

parte of the people, yea to themſelues, namelye, that vttereth them. This ſhoulde bee a ſuffycyente teſtymonye of my ſayinge to all menne of an vpryght iudgement: but we wyll go further with them.
                  Fyrſte concerning GOD, I ſaye▪ that where as they doo ſet foorth the meryts of any creature to pacifie his wrath, they ſpoyle and robbe him of his perfyte righteouſneſſe, the which by this meanes can not bée perfyte, if hee take for payment eyther all or part of that which maye procéede from a ſinner. Although I denye not but the good lyfe of a faythfull perſon is acceptable to God, but not to obtaine ſaluation and eternall lyfe by this tytle.
                  Item, they robbe and ſpoyle hym in ſo dooynge of hys perfyte mercie. For conſider: if we can ſatiſfie to GOD in any part or péece, it followeth that he doeth not quitte, or forgeue vs all, but the reſt which remayned. Wherefore I

conclude, that in ſteade of the true God, who is perfitely ryghteous and perfitely mercifull in Ieſus Chriſte, onely as wée haue declared, they worſhippe a dreame and fantaſie of their own bead, to whom they haue geuen the name and tytle of God.
               
               
                  2 If the doctrine of the Papiſtes bee true, it foloweth that Ieſus Chriſte is not verie man.
                  ITem, concernyng Ieſus Chriſte, by whome only we haue ſaluation whether wee conſider his perſon, or that we regard his office of mediator: I ſaye that in ſteade of the true Ieſus Chriſte, they worſhippe a Ieſus Chriſte which they haue made and forged. For concerning his perſonne, although they ſaye well that be is verie God and verie man, yet neuertheleſſe when they geue him an inuyſible bodye, a body which can not bee touched, which holdeth or occupyeth no place, doo they not ſpoyle him

of his humanitie? And when they ſaye hee maye be in many places at once, is it not to bring his body to be infinite, and conſequently to turne his humanitie into diuinite?
               
               
                  3 The papiſtes doctrine maketh the oblation of Ieſus Chriſte of none effecte.
                  ANd concerning his offyce, it conſyſteth in this, that he is onelye King and gouernour vniuerſally. The onely Prophet and declarer of the wyl of his father, and the only eternal ſacrificator or hie prieſt, ye which prieſthood lyeth in two poyntes, that is to ſaye, in the oblation whiche hée hath made once in his owne perſon for to ſanctifye the Church for euer Hebre. 10., & in the interceſſion towarde God his Father, the which continueth to this daye, and ſhall do Hebre. 7. 1. Timo. 2.. I conclude then that the doctryne of the Pope wypeth away all this.
                  Nowe for the begynning of the fyrſte point of prieſthood, if it be ſo that Chriſte

muſt bee offered vp by the Prieſt euerie daye for the quicke and for the deade, is not that as muche to ſaye, as that the oblation whiche hée hath made him ſelfe once for all in his owne perſonne, is not ſufficient?
                  Moreouer, if the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſte bee ſufficient to ſaluation and if he be the true Ieſus, that is to ſaye, true and onelye ſauiour, howe then ſhall that be true which they ſaye, that there is but the faulte or offence pardoned? and concerninge the payne, that it is onelye chaunged from eternall into temporall, in ſuche ſorte that we muſt paye it in this worlde, or in another. But if this bée falſe, as it is moſt falſe, what grounde haue they then to buylde theyr meryte and ſatiſfaction towardes God, their Purgatorie and indulgences and ſuch lyke?
                  Item, if man ought to ſatiſfye and paye of his owne, for the payne due for his offences, the which can not bée done without the merytes and ſuffrages of

other by reaſon whereof hée muſt bée in the fyre of Purgatorye, vntyll ſome other haue payed for him and in his name: From whence then commeth the merites of Saintes which the Pope ſelleth to vs? and howe can they dyſcharge other, whiche ceaſe not to augment theyr owne debte daylye? And what notarie hath made or written any ſuch couenaunt or contractes? Beholde many of the auncient doctours condemned this opinion, as S. Cyprian againſt Dimetrian in the fyrſt Traycte, Saynt Therome vppon the ſyxthe Chapter of the Epiſtle of Saynte Paule to the Galathes. Saynt Chryſoſtome in the Sermon of Lazarus, yea namely Saynt Gregorye in the fowrthe Booke of hys Dialoges nine and thyrtie Chapter leaueth not to be purged in Purgatory the leaſt offence.
                  Item, if they muſt yet go to purgatorie, wherefore ſerueth their confeffion and abſolution?
                  
                     Item if Ieſus Chriſte be the Lambe, which only taketh away all the ſinnes of the world, when did be reſigne this office to holy water, and an infinite number of ſuch other toyes?
               
               
                  4 The Papiſtes aboly
                        •
                     heth the true interceſsion of Ieſus Chriſt.
                  ANd concerning the other poynt of this prieſthood of Ieſus Chriſte, y• is to ſay the interceſſion towards God his Father, although y• papiſtes put Ieſus Chriſt alwayes before as y• principall, and without whome they can no thing do (as they ſaye▪) neuertheles is he not ſpoyled by them of his honour when they be not contented with him onelye? And in ſtead to go directly to him, which 
                        •
                     yddeth vs come to him ſo louynglye, they runne to others (yea whiche often tymes bee rather in hell then in Heauen) as if there were ſome creature in Heauen or in earth, whiche might beare vs more affection, or that were more redyer to heare vs, or who might be more acceptable to the Father, then the onelye

ſonne of God Iohn. 14.. It is he only which gaue him ſelfe to death for vs: whiche is with vs, & continuallye dooth as it were deſire vs by his holy word, to aſſure our ſelues of his loue, and to prepare vs to him, as to the onelye waye to go ryght to the father. But there is yet a worſe, which is yt they wyll make Ieſus Chriſte ſubiect to his mother. In crying out with a lowde and hie voyce, Roga patrem, iube natum: that is to ſay, pray the Father, commaūd thy ſonne, and iure matris impera, that is to ſaye, commaunde as a mother. And in briefe, there is ſcant one tytle geuen to Ieſus Chriſt nor propheſy of him which they doo not attrybute to her, calling her Quéene of Heauen, porter of Paradiſe, theyr lyfe, theyr ſwéetneſſe, treaſourer of grace, ye refuge and aduocate of ſinners, in diſhonouring him all that they maye, and alſo making the poore people to vnderſtand that they honour her, contrary to all the worde of God, and to the wrytynges of the moſt auncient Doctours: wytneſſe that which Epiphanius wrote

againſt the heretikes, which they call Colliridians, Saint Chriſoſtome in the Homelie of the Samaritane, S Auguſtine in the laſt Chapter of the true Relygion. Saynt Ambroſe vppon the fyrſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Romaines.
               
               
                  5 The Papiſts doth not acknowledge Ieſus Chriſt to be the perfect declarer of the wyll of God, neyther the holy Scriptures to bee a ſuffycient doctrine of ſaluation.
                  COncerning his office of a prophet, that is to ſay, declarer of ye wyll of God, what man is there, of an vpright iudgement, whiche they can make beléeue ye Ieſus Chriſt, neyther by his owne mouth nor by his apoſtles, dyd not ſuffycientlye declare all that whiche is requiſyte to the Saluation of man? For them ſelues hath wrytten the contrarie Iohn. 15. Actes. 15. 1. Cori. 7 Galath. 1. Colloſ. 2.. And if the Scriptures be ſuffycient, from whence commeth this infynite number of humayne tradycions

and commaundementes, impoſed to the poore conſciences, as neceſſarye to ſaluation, not onelye aboue, but contrarye to the Scriptures? For concernynge the au

                     thorytie of Counſelles, it hath beene ſuffycyentlye declared howe farre it extendeth. And put the caſe it were that thynge whiche they doo ſaye: how proue they that the Counſels were led and conducted by the ſpyrite of God▪ the whiche be dyrectlye contrarye to the Prophets and Apoſtles, and other counſels before?
                  For example the mariage is approued in all degrées of miniſters in the church, aſwell by the expreſſe Scriptures, as we haue ſhewed, as by the fyrſt Counſell of Nicene, from whence commeth then the forbyddinge of maryage, but of the Diuell, as wytneſſeth Saynte Paule 1. Ti

                        . 4.? Item, the falſehood of the Pope of Rome whiche deſyring to haue, and vſurpe the iuriſdiction ouer Affrica, is reuealed and condempned in a Counſell of Carthage, Sainte Auguſtine being preſent▪
                     
and was concluded that none ſhould appeale from Affrica to Rome, frō whence then commeth the authority of the Pope as head of the vniuerſall Church?
                  Finally, if the counſels be ſet and ſtablyſhed by the holy Ghoſte, from whence commeth it then, that there be none y• doo leſſe eſtéeme them when they lyſt, then the Pope and all his ſequiel? I wyll ſaye yet more that there is at this daye neyther Pope, Cardinal, Biſhop, nor Prieſt which maye not be reproued, excommunicated and accurſed, if they ſhall be iudged by the counſels. And if they dare denye I ſhall proue it.
               
               
                  6 The papiſtes ſpoyleth Ieſus Chriſt of his office of head of the church.
                  COncerning the office of Kinge and gouernor of the Churche, of which Ieſus Chriſt is head both in heauē & in earth, ſytting on the ryght hande of God his father, and yet neuertheles preſent in his Church, by his ſpirituall vertue, from whence commeth it then, that they wyll appoynte him a Uycar in his

preſence? conſidering principallye that it is directly againſt the word of God, agaynſte the Metropolytans iuriſdiction, ordayned by the firſt counſell of Nicene,Looke the Epi. of S. Gregorie 32. 34. 36. 38. 39. The 4. booke and the. 24. 28. 29. 30. The 6▪ booke. againſt all the hyſtorie of the primatiue Church, yea againſt ſainct Gregory himſelfe, whiche wytneſſeth in many places that the name of vniuerſall Byſhoppe, ought not to be vpon earth, but to Antechriſt. Moreouer put the caſe yet that he were Uicare of Chriſte, in the vniuerſall gouernement of the Churche, from whence commeth▪ thys power to dyſpenſe with the worde of Ieſus Chriſte, and to abrogate the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and namely of Sainct Peter? And yet neuertheles are not aſhamed to ſaye that they are his ſucceſſors? ſaint Peter was he not ſent to H

                      by the Churche? refuſeth he to render accompt of his office? and what dyd he teache to others? I (ſayth he? beſéech the Prieſts 1. Peter. 5. (that is to ſaye, thoſe which haue office in the Church) I which alſo am a Prieſt with them, & a witnes of the afflyctions

of Chriſt, and partaker alſo of the glorye which ſhall be reuealed: Féede the flocke of Chriſte as much as ye may, watching ouer it, not by conſtraint, but willingly, not for diſhoneſt gayne, but with a ready wyll, and not as hauing lordſhip ouer the cleargy, (that is to ſay, ouer the heritage of the lord) but ſo y• ye be examples of the flocke: & when the principal paſtor ſhall appeare, you ſhall receyue a crown of incorruptible glory. Behold y• proper words of ſ. Peter which are far of from appropriating to himſelfe y• ſegniory or lordſhip of Italy, & ſuperintendēt aſwell of Kings & Princes, as of all other churches. And briefly, if they looke well, they ſhal finde, that there is nothing agréeing or any compariſon betwéene S. Peter & theſe which falſly cal themſelues his ſucceſſors, but in one thing, y• is to wete, the denying of Ieſus Chriſte, for the which S. Peter repented, but theſe do not.
               
               
                  7 By the doctrine of the papiſts, we can in no wiſe vnderſtand how mortal the naturall ſicknes of mankinde is.
                  
                     IT is no maruell though ſuche people vnderſtande not the offyce of Chriſte our onely ſauiour: for they know not howe deadely theyr ſickneſſe is, nor by what meane Ieſus Chryſt our only medycine, is applyed and vnyted to vs. For firſte in ſteade to declare, that man is altogether dead by originall ſinne, otherwyſe called naturall corruption, they teach that the vnderſtanding and wyl of man, is ſo ſore hurte, that the fyrſt grace doeth but onely eaſe and comforte vs in our infyrmitie. So that if this doctrine 
                        •
                     e true, our regeneration procéedeth not onely of grace, but there is a participation or concurrence betwéene grace, & that which they call fréewyll, of whiche is ſpoken amplye in the 13. 14▪ and 15. Articles of the thyrde poynte. Moreouer, to ioygne and heape together errour vpon errour, they wyll haue a certayne diſpoſition procéeding from the nature of mā, to receyue the fyrſt grace, and that God maye be prouoked by our merites, for to geue vs the ſeconde grace.
                  
                     Item, that the concupiſcence whiche continueth after Baptiſme, is not ſinne of it ſelf before God. Item that al ſmnes deſerue not eternall death, for there bee ſome whiche they call venyall ſynnes. Item, if our ſaluation be grounded vpon our good workes, in all or in parte, to what ende doth grace ſerue vs then, but as an inſtrument to helpe our frée wyll

                  8 Another execrable error of the papiſtes in the vſing of the onely medicine of health, which is the benefit of Ieſus Chriſt.
                  AS there is but one onely Iuſtyce by imputation for the whiche we be eſtéemed, and holden for ryghteous before God, & be conſequent ſaued that is to ſay, by the righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſte, whiche is declared to vs in the goſpell. So is there but one meane to be ioyned & vnited with Ieſus Chriſte

for to haue ſaluation in hym, that is to we
                        •
                     e fayth, which is an aſſuraunce that all Chriſtiās ought to haue of their election & ſaluation by the onely grace and goodnes of God, in Ieſus Chriſt. Fayth and aſſuraunce is created, and dayly encreaſed by the vertue of the holy ghoſte, within the hartes of the electe, by the meane of preachinge the worde of God, and the miniſtration of the ſacraments, as wée haue amply and largely declared in the thyrde and fowrth poyncte of this confeſſion. So then this fayth is as the hande, which onely doth receyue and apprehende Ieſus Chriſte to the ſaluation of him that beleeueth. It followeth that thoſe doo take awaye all meanes of ſaluation from men, which dyrectly ſtryue and fyght againſte this doctrine, not knowinge them ſelues what fayth is, muche leſſe can they declare it to others. For according to theyr doctrine, fayth is no other thinge than to beléeue in generall, that which is contayned in the holie ſcriptures to be true, & that the Romiſh

Church as they call it, cannot erre, what ſoeuer they ſaye or doo. Notwithſtanding, concerning the fyrſt of theſe two poyntes, it is forbydden to tranſlate the Scriptures into the mother tongue, and to reade it, to knowe what is contayned therein, to the ende it maye bée knowen what it is that they do beléeue, except he be a Doctour or a man of the Church, as they cal them. And ſo by this means it is folly to permyt the greateſt part of their prieſts to reade it. For cōſider the greateſt parte of them cannot ſcarcely reade it truly. And of thoſe which cā reade, yea euen the greateſt Prelates, (ſetting aſyde thoſe whiche haue not muche more knowledge of Chriſtes doctrine, than beaſts which féede in the fielde, and thoſe which paſſe not greatly for it, in exercyſing them ſelues rather in other things than in their vocation, & namely mocke it with open mouthe) I beléeue the reſt ſhalbe found maruelous few. Notwithſtāding according to their own doctrine al this is not without faith, although he

knowe not what he beleeueth, and what may happē of this. Certainly y• which Ieſus Chriſt ſaid, if the blind lead the blind both falleth into ye pyt. Here ye may ſée ye heauē, whether this which they cal faith may bring vs vnto. But ther is yet more for namely they ſay & maintain (ſo ſhamles are they) y• to be aſſured of electiō & ſaluatiō in Ieſus chriſt, & to pray wt al truſt & aſſurance, as ſaith ſ. Iames is a preſūption: but to truſt in good workes as they cal thē, & to ſtay & wait vpon whatſoeuer they teach of their own brain, this is no preſūption after their doctrin, but a true & catholike deuotion. Behold the 2. point of theyr fayth, y• is to wete, to beleue al y• which ſéemeth good to them, & not ſo hardy to enquire whether y• be according to ye ſcripture or no. Now y• reaſon why, for ſooth, becauſe whoſoeuer hath a Myter & a croſſe, can neuer erre in the fayth. And aboue all the Pope, yea although he led into hel ſoules by cartloads (as themſelues are not aſhamed to declare by wryting to theyr Cannons) reuerſyng and

ouerthrowing the worde of God and all the auncient counſelles? But who ſhall beleeue them, but he that wyll be deceyued willingly? Looke what was propheſied by the Apoſtles of them, and ye ſhall ſee it as cleare as the Sunne in a fayre day come to paſſe.
               
               
                  9 They know not in the papiſtry the exerciſe of the lawe of God, or the goſpell.
                  WE haue declared that the lawe of God is the onelye perfyte rule of iuſtyce before hym, and that it pertayneth to one onely God, to bynde the conſciences. But theſe here on the contrarie ceaſſe not to heape lawes vppon lawes, not onelye aboue, but alſo againſte the lawe of God, whiche they make voyde by their owne ordinaunces. We haue alſo declared by the manifeſt Scripture, that the yoake of the ceremoniall lawe, is put awaye by the comming of Ieſus Chriſte, in whome lyeth the fulfilling of all that was fygured by the ceremonies of the lawe. But theſe felowes haue on

the contrary, ſo abolyſhed the Ceremonies of the lawe, that they haue made a C. for one, yea of their owne fantaſye, notwithſtanding that the Apoſtles, yea, namely thoſe of whome they vaunt and boaſt to haue their auctority, haue clearlye determined the contrarye. Acts. 15. 1. Cor. 7. Colloſ. 2. Timo. 4. Timo. 3. Item, where as the lawe is not geuen vs for to ſéeke our ſaluation therein, but for to declare to vs our condempnation, and that wée ſhoulde ſéeke health and lyfe in Ieſus Chriſte onelye (beſyde other exerciſes of the whiche wée haue ſpoken in other places) theſe cleane contrarye doo not onely ſeeke their ſaluation (whiche is as muche as if they ſoughte theyr lyfe in the death) but muche worſe, as if the commaundementes of God dyd not condempne vs inough, they haue ioyned & put to them, and doo ioyne dayly newe lynkes and ſnares, to ſtrayne the poore conſcience. Yet notwithſtanding haue no ſhame to ſaye, that thoſe which holde them to the pure woorde of God and hys doctrine, ſéeke a carnal libertie, but God

If y• abuſe be great in the vſe of the lawe in vs, yet is it worſe on ye other part in ye ignorance & malice of the word of God, which we call goſpell, that is to ſay good newes, for aſmuch as it ſet teth forth & declareth to all beléeuers, a righteouſnes fréely in the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which only delyuereth vs from ye curſe & malediction, which the lawe pronounceth vs culpable. But theſe people be very diligent to ſyng it by peeces, and chop it in a language which they vnderſtande not, & to ſenſe him y• pronounceth it, and to hang it about their necks after the manner of Sorcerers: but to preach it, or make it to be vnderſtande diligentlye and purelye., this ſhoulde be founde verye ſtraunge. Excepte ſome one certayne daye in the yeare, that one doo preache that ſéemeth good to him ſelfe, to kéepe an order in theyr couent. Moreouer they thynke, that the Goſpell is no other thing, but an other lawe more perfecte than the olde lawe, and ſo they

abolyſhe entierly the vſe of the Goſpell, ſending vs to our owne workes.
               
               
                  10 They know not what good workes are in the papiſtrie.
                  THe errour is not leſſe in this which concerneth the fruites of faith, than in that whiche toucheth the faythe it ſelf. For it apeareth by that which we haue declared héere before in the articles 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. and. 19. of the fowrth poynt that we entend nothing leſſe than to reproue good workes, when on the contrarie, we maintaine that regeneration from whence good works doth procéede, is inſeparable conioygned with fayth in ſuch ſort, that he is a lyar which ſaith he beléeueth in God, and notwithſtanding, ſtudyeth not to lyue after ye rule of God. But theſe perſons contrariwiſe, neither know from whence ſpringeth good workes whiche he acceptable to God, nor what they be, nor to what purpoſe they do ſerue. And notwithſtāding, they wyll ſay (to them that lyſt to heare them) that they be the aduocates of good workes.
                  
                     But we beleeue that whoſoeuer wyll looke narrowlye to their doctrine, or to their lyfe, or to bothe, wyll confeſſe that it beſeemeth them as well to ſpeake of good workes, as for common harlottes, to diſpute of the nature and excellencie of chaſtitie.
                  But principallye howe haue they turned into an execrable blaſphemye, the moſt excellent worke, y• is to ſay praier? For ouer and beſide the aboliſhing of the paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt they vſe to ioyne and accompanye it with the merytes of whome they lyſt, and ſowe together the textes of the Scripture at their pleaſure without any reaſon: hyerynge other toBy

                  What is all this any other thing

than to mocke God openly, what ſo euer good intent or cuſtome they can alleage?
               
               
                  11 In the papiſtry they know not what is a Sacrament, nor what is the vſe therof.
                  A Monge al the horrible corruptions which are ſeene in the papiſtry, this of the Sacraments is maruellous, as I hope that thoſe wyll confeſſe which haue wel conſidered that which we haue ſummarily ſayd here before. Now for to declare here all the abuſes, it ſhoulde be a matter to long, for the which me thinketh it ſufficient to touche the principall poyntes.
                  Fyrſt theſe great Theologians know not well what a Sacrament is, nor to what ende God hath ordained the ſacramentes, for all his Churche. Neyther be contented to haue polluted the holy baptiſme, and aboliſhed the holy Communion of our Lord, as we ſhall ſay hereafter, but alſo of a ſymple Ceremonye of the laying on▪ of handes, they haue made fowre Sacraments: that is to ſaye, confirmation,

penance, the orders, & annealing. And moreouer becauſe the number of 7. pleaſeth them very wel, they would alſo haue mariage a ſacrament, wherof we wyll ſpeake ſomething briefly.
                  
                     Firſt of confyrmation.
                     Concerning confirmation it is certain that the true auncient Byſhops examined thoſe whiche were baptiſed in theyr infancie, and cauſed them to render confeſſion of theyr fayth, when they were come of age, for to confirme them. And after in laying handes vpon theyr heade (which is a moſt ancient ceremonie, the which Ieſus Chriſte & his Apoſtles haue vſed) commended thē to God. The ſame alſo was done to thoſe which were ſeduced by Heretykes, and after were teturned to the Church. Nowe for vs, God be thanked, this examynation and inſtruction is reeſtablyſhed, and dilygently exercyſed in our Churches. But theſe contrarywiſe, hauing vtterly abolyſhed

the cauſe of any ſuch manner of doings, notwithſtanding, haue made a fayre ſacrament without worde, promiſe, or ordynaunce of God, after they haue put to theyr creame, oyle, & what they lyſt elſe, becauſe ye laying on of hands with prayer, ſéemeth to them, to be a verye lyght thing. Finally, for to ioyne an execrable blaſphemy to theyr ignorance, haue not ben aſhamed to prefer theyr ſacramēt of confirmation before the holye baptiſme, as theyr Canons declareth playnly.
                  
                  
                     Of penance.
                     It hath bene declared here aboue in ye articles. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. and. 19. of the. 4 poynt which be the cauſes & the effects of true penance: then much leſſe would we aboliſh penance. Moreouer in the article 46. of the ſayde fowrthe poynt, we haue ſhewed howe Baptyſme is the true Sacrament ordayned of God, by expreſſe teſtimony on the ſcripture. Math. 5. Mark. 1 Luke. 3 Acts. 13. But theſe not content with the ordinances of God, vnder this ſhadow that opē and publyke

ſinners, according to the diſcipline of the Churche (of the which I haue ſpoken in his place) were reconcyled to the congregation, with prayer and impoſition of handes, after they had fulfylled that which was enioyned them, by ye eccleſyaſtical ſenate (not to ſaitſfice to God, but for to amende the ſlaunder, and to geue ſufficient teſtimonye of theyr amendement) theſe I ſaye vnder this ſhadowe, haue confounded and ouerthrowen all together, in making a newe Sacrament of penaunce, of which they make three partes, to wéete, contrition of the harte, confeſſion of the mouth in the Prieſtes eare, & ſatiſfaction by works. Whereof we doo principally reproue theſs which followe.
                     Fyrſt, of their owne braine and fantaſie onely, they haue brought in this Sacrament, which can not be but falſe becauſe there is no worde of God for it.
                     Secondlye, for that they requyre as neceſſarye to ſaluation, all the partes aboue ſayde, wherein they ſhew themſelues

not as Phiſitions, but very murderers or killers of the conſciences, as it ſhall be ſayde hereafter.
                     Thyrdlye, they requyre an entyre and full perfection in all the aforeſayde three partes▪ the which is impoſſible for man to doo. So all men maye, ſée to what ende theyr doctrine tendeth.
                     Item for to make vp the whole heape of wickedneſſe, they adde to it this blaſphemy, that by the merytes of thoſe things, theyr ſinnes be pardoned. And ſo by thys meanes aboliſh and make of none effect, the benefite of him, by whoſe bloud our ſoules be purified and made cleane.
                     In the fyfte place▪ becauſe they ſhall not ſlaunder vs, ye ſhall perceyue howe we doo vnder ſtande of theſe three partes of theyr penance.
                  
                  
                     Of contrition.
                     Concerninge the contrition of the harte, wee know that the verye true amendment of a Chriſtian, muſt beginne by the feelyng of his ſynnes as wée haue

ſayd in the article 23. of the fowrth poynt but in ſuch wyſe that it may be a way to lead vs to the frée mercy of God, and not to thinke to wype out our ſinnes, by the merite of our contrition, which is not a meryte of ryghteouſneſſe, but a ſorrowe due to our ſinne.
                  
                  
                     Of confeſſion.
                     As of confeſſion we finde fyue kynds, the which we teach and practiſe warely and dilygently according to the worde of God, not for to ſéeke therein remiſſion of the ſinnes, but as fruites and effectes of the true féeling of our ſinnes.
                     The fyrſte, is publyke confeſſyon of the whole Churche towardes God, when they do aſſemble themſelues ordinarylye to heare the worde of God, or extraordynarily, in ſome afflictions or trouble Leuit. 15 Exod. 10 Nehe. 10.
                     The ſeconde, is of euery one partycularly, opening his harte ordinarilye before God, to aſke pardon of him, after the example of the Publican Iohn. 13 Daniel. 9 1. Iohn. 1 Math. 18 Luke. 17.
                     
                        The thirde is, when a ſynner extraordinarilye, touched with the true zeale of God, commeth ſo farre as to confeſſe openly his myſerie, and the mercy of God towardes him after the example of Dauid, and many other Pſalm. 51 Math. 3 Luke. 23 1. Corin. 15 1. Timo. 1.
                     The fowrth is particularlye Iames. 5., that is to wéete, when a ſynner deſyringe conſolation and aſſuraunce of his ſaluation, commeth to hys neyghbour, and principallye to his Paſtor, whoſe offyce is to ſhewe the vſe of the worde of God, as well to the whole flocke which is committed to him, as to euery perſon particularlye. But hée muſte take héede howe hée layeth this yoake vppon theyr conſciences, for God hath not made it as a lawe.
                     And alſo there▪ muſt bee héede taken more nearer, that they ioygne not nor attribute abſolution eyther to the perſon of the Paſtour, or to the vertue of certaine wordes pronounced.
                     Nor to any other thing, thē to the pure grace of God in Ieſus Chriſt, apprehended

by faith. As is declared to vs by his worde, as hath bene ſpoken before in the Articles. 25. 26. 27. &. 28 of the fift poynt.
                     The firſt is when a ſinner reconcyleth himſelfe to him whom he hath offended, be it to one particular perſon, or to many Math. 4. and. 6., or to the whole Church: which is a

                            2. Cori. 2 confeſſion & reknowledging of ſyns ordained of God, which foloweth alwayes a true repentaunce.
                     Beholde then the maner of knowledging our ſynnes, grounded vpon the holy ſcriptures: and teacheth vs moreouer that none can be ſufficiently ſory and penitent for his ſinne. But concerning the neceſſity to confeſſe our ſinnes to prieſts as they call them, leauing out nothyng at all, as if remiſſion of ſinnes depended vppon ſuch a recytall: we dare by Gods word boldly affirme, that it is a very deuelliſhe and wycked ordinaunce, wherof no fruit can enſue in the Church of God. As alſo it appeareth y• it was neuer inſtituted of God, by the opinion of the canoniſtes, but by Innocent the thyrde C. omnis vtriuſque ſexus de ſūma trinitate in antiq..

It is apparant that of a long tyme there was in ſome Churches, a certain perſon ordained among the elders or auncients for the vſe of the fowrth and fift kinde of confeſſion, wherof we haue ſpoken: But there is no cauſe why to impoſe this law to any people, or to binde the conſciences to a thynge impoſſyble, that is to ſaye, to perfyte recytall of all his ſynnes, much leſſe to eſtabliſhe the remiſſion of ſinnes, in the ſame. But afterwarde this cuſtom was abolyſhed in Conſtantinople, by Nectarius, predeceſſour to S. Iohn Chriſoſtome, who afterwarde ſpeciallye condempned thys auricular Confeſtion. And yet there was in that tyme no ſuch ſeruitude or bondage ioyned to it, nor was neuer vſed or done by Nectarius, nor yet Chriſoſtom had not approued it, as to haue bene ordained of God, eyther neceſſary, or profitable to the Church Nicephore in the hiſtory eccleſiaſtycall. 112. booke. 28. c. Chriſoſt. on the Pſalme 50. homil. 2 I tē ſermon of penance & confeſſion. Item. 5. homily of the incomprehenſible nature of god. Item. 4. homily of Lazarus..
                     Concerning ſatiſfaction, we knowe thanked be God, that true repentaunce requyreth that he whiche hath offended, ſhall ſatiſfye to hym that is offended, as

much as maye be poſſible. Moreouer, we receyue and embrace, (with good moderation) the auncient cuſtome of the eccleſiaſtycall diſciplyne, toward thoſe which haue offended the Church, and which deſire to be vnited againe into the flock: but as to God to appoſe and ſet againſte his wrath, any other thing then ye only ſatiſfaction of Ieſus Chriſt, we ſay & affirme boldly, that it is the moſt wicked & excreable blaſphemy that can be. For conſider their penaunce, as they call them, for the moſt part be vile Idolatries & ſuperſtitious infamies, partly of their owne nature, as Pylgrimages, Maſſes, prayers, nūbred & compted, and none vnderſtande them, worſhipping of Idols, & ſuch other abhominations, couered vnder ye ſhadow of good ententes, & partly becauſe of the abuſe, of faſting, almoſes, afflictions of body: all the which things and ſuch other lyke tende to Idolatry, when they ioyne to them the opinion of deſeruing or merite, in mingling them with the bloud of Chriſt.
                  
                  
                     
                     ¶ Of the extreme vnction called anealing.
                     Amōg other things, wherunto a paſt or is boūd, we do count ye viſitatiō of ye ſick, whom he ought to comfort & to aſſure thē of theyr ſaluation as is required, & according to the contents of the word of God. Now the apoſtles & other of the ancient Church, ſo long as ye gyft of miracles endured, haue vſed in theyr viſitations, not only this ceremony of laying on of hāds but alſo oyle, wherewith they annointed the ſycke Mark. 6. Iames. 5, not after forme of medicine, nor yet to make an ordinary ſacrament in the Church. For they themſelues neuer vſed it, and yet muche les dyd they bleſſe or worſhyp the oyle, or to croſſe it, or to ioyne it to certaine vertues: and in briefe, nothing les then to coniure or charme it. But to aſſure the ſicke perſon, certainly by this viſyble ſigne and ceremony. But theſe men on the contrarie they come neuer to the ſick, but as do the

Rauens to the carrayne, and alſo knowe well that the gyft of healing by miracles was not geuen to the Church
                           〈…〉
                         for a certain tyme. Neuertheles they haue retayned and kepte the ſygn
                           •
                         and marke, yea, as neceſſarye to ſaluation for ſoules aboliſhing the benefyte of Ieſus Chriſte, after they haue vtterly diſguiſed it, with a thouſande manner of apyſhe playes at the leaſt. For the Apoſtles vſed not the oyle, but in thoſe whiche they healed myraculouſly. Therefore theſe ought to be aſhamed, not onely to vſe as they falſely alleadge as the Apoſtles dyd, but vſe it in thoſe which be out of all bope of lyfe: by reaſon wherof they call extreame vnction, or the laſt annoynting.
                  
                  
                     Of orders.
                     Concerning theyr orders as they call thē. Nay what diſordex was there euer ſo great in the whole world. For they be not yet accorded how many ther be. For one nameth ſeuen, the other nyne, and ſome thyrtéene. But to ſpeake as it is we

may anſwere truely, that there is no one order in altogether▪ And as concerning offyces, we ſhall ſhewe hereafter that they haue not retained one of thoſe whiche God dyd appoint in his Church.
                     And for their ſacramentes as they call them, where is any one word or promiſe of God in their trompery? Secondly concerning the Ceremonies whiche they doo vſe in their orders. cā they ſhew any one of them ordained of God? By what title then ſhoulde they be ſacramentes? But conſider we the ſame more nearely. It appeareth that in the Church of God the perſons lawfully called and elected, for to ſerue aſwell to to the word, as the gouernement of the eccleſiaſticall affayres, were as conſecrated & dedicated to God, by the ceremony of laying on of handes, with the prayers of the whole Churche. But theſe people not content with this ſimplycitie, what they haue done? They haue quite put awaye the cuſtome of the aunciēt Church▪ & brought in this which foloweth, yea with a ſtrange language.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the clericall tonſure.
                     Firſt, their muſt be a clericall tonſure where as they clyp thrée or fowre lyttle 
                           •
                        eaires in his crowne, and he muſt haue a lytle blow on the eare, and then put his head in a ſurplyſe, as they call it, and behold a Prieſt ready made, able to haue a benefice, paying honeſtly for it, and to be exempte from the ſecular magiſtrate in time of néede, except being of age he wer maried to a widow, or were twiſe maried. Behold the foundation of the Popiſh clergie, as comfortable & agréeing to the worde of God & the auncient Cannons, as the diuels be to the Angels.
                     Item, if one looke on the ceremonies of the iiij. orders which they call Minores, they geue the keyes of the Temple into the hand
                           •
                         of thoſe which they call Oſtiarie. A booke to handle to thoſe they call Lectors: to their Exorciſts certain forms and maners of coniurations, and to their Acolytes, they gaue tapers and crewets

to touche. Notwythſtandinge, thoſe which receyue theſe fayre ſacramentes, haue neyther Temples to ſhutte, nor Bybles to reade, nor Diuels to coniure, nor Biſhops to folowe: and what more, they receyue all thoſe offices at one tyme together. Who is it now that ſéeth not that all this is a verye apyſhe playe and mockery to God and his Church.
                     Alſo for the thrée orders which they cal Maiores, beholde howe it goeth. Thoſe which they call Deacons, receyue a ſtole vppon their lefte arme, with a text of the Goſpell chopped in péeces. Then my Lord the Byſhoppe (without callyng or Byſhopryke) putteth hys handes vpon him, to make vp the meaſure of the auncient ceremony. And yet notwithſtanding, theſe godly miſteries they playe all in a ſtraunge and vnknowen language. And howe ſhall hée bee a Deacon whiche hath no goods for the poore to diſtribute? No, for it is not geuen him in charge by my Lord Byſhop.
                     
                        But to put wine in the chalice and bread on the paten▪ To make cleane the alter and dreſſe it fayre, to beare the croſſe, to ſynge the Goſpell and the Pyſtle to the people in a ſtraunge tongue, and to doo other apyſhe playe in theyr highe maſſe. Beholde howe correſpondent the Deacons in the Churche of God, were wyth theſe of the papiſtry.
                     The ſubdeacons receyue of the Biſhop the Chalyce and the paten. And of the archdeacons, the crewettes with water, for (as they ſaye) theyr office is to beare the crewette and the to well, to geue the Prieſt to waſhe, to ſet the implementes for the maſſe vpon the aulter, to receyue the offeringes, whereof the poore get nothing. Behold an other mommery.
                     Finally, their prieſts be ordained manifeſtly for to aboliſhe and bring to none effecte, the onely oblation which Ieſus Chriſte hath made in his owne perſon. They be greaſed with Oyle, to bring againe the leuiticall high Prieſthood, abolyſhed by Ieſus Chriſte. Moreouer they may

receyue a breathing of my Lord Byſhop as though he had the holy ghoſt cloſed in his ſtomacke. Beſide this they do geue him a chalice with a paten and the bread not to eate, nor to féede other, but to ſing Theyr lowe Maſſes be all ſayde, which is againſt this order to ſing maſſe. (as they call it) which is a worde as me thinketh that ſhould be ſuffycient to condempne the vſe of theyr lowe maſſes, as they call them. Here ye may behold for theyr myſordered orders.
                  
                  
                     Of mariage.
                     For mariage it hath bene ſayde before in what reuerence we haue it according as it is Printed in our ſeruice Bookes, plainly to be ſéene. But theſe men be for the moſt parte, as great contempners of maryage, as they are great louers of all kinde of lechery and whoredome (as heauen and earth can wytnes) puttyng maryage when they lyſfe, in the place and number of the Sacramentes, by a verie apiſhe and ignoraunt manner. As it hath bene declared to them, I thynke a thouſande tymes. Yet notwithſtanding wyll

they permit the ſpyritualtye as they call them, to vſe this ſacrament? No truely, leaſt that Chriſtendome ſhoulde bee loſt. So much ſeemeth this ſacramēt to them to bee polluted and fylthye. And in déede I confeſſe that whoredome of all kyndes appertayneth and agreeth better wyth them: I leaue out the meanes by the whiche they pollute the holy ſtate of matrimonie, as muche as in them is, theyr foolyſhe benedictions, theyr falſe opinion touchinge the ſeconde marriages, the bondage and ſeruitude layed vppon the conſcience touching affynitie, both ſpirituall and temporall. I pray them of one thing, if they woulde not be angry with that I ſhall ſay, that they would accord & ſhew me their opinion that mariage is a ſacrament, with one ſentence regyſtred in theyr decrées, (whome it maketh aucthor one of their Popes named Sircius) to wéete, whether that whiche Saynte Paule ſayde, thoſe which be in the fleſhe can not pleaſe God, bée vnderſtande of mariage or not.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of Baptiſme.
                     Concerning Baptiſme, certaine it is that the Lord hauing reſpect to his elected, hath not permytted that this Sacrament ſhould be aboliſhed in the papiſtry. For they baptiſe in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt. The effect of Baptiſme, dependeth not in any wyſe of him which miniſtreth it: but yet notwithſtanding, in howe many ſortes haue they polluted it, for to bryng it to nothing, and vtterlye to abolyſhe it, if it had bene poſſible.
                     Fyrſt, all is ſayde and done in an vnknowen language, and although they had ſpoke in the vulgare tongue, what declaration is there of the ryghte vſe of holy Baptiſme, in this forme and maner which they vſe in the papaltie.
                     Secondlye, howe many ſygnes and Ceremonyes, haue they ioygned to it, wythout the woorde of GOD, wherein they ſtaye and truſte more then on

the ſimple and holy ordinaunce of Ieſus Chriſte and the Apoſtles? And it ſerueth them to no purpoſe to alledge antiquitie. For tyme can not, nor may not ſpoyle God of the honour which pertayneth to him onelye, as wée haue ſayde in the 22. Article of the fowrth point. Moreouer they knowe well, that the ceremonies of Baptiſme, were neuer holden by the Fathers for to be of the ſubſtance of the ſacrament. Therfore, when as ſuper ſtition ſpringeth, it is neceſſary to aboliſh and ſuppreſſe it. For certainely it is not poſſyble that the foolyſh deuotion of men wyll be domegeable to the Church when they cannot bee contented with the ordinance of God.
                     Thirdly, the grace of God it is not tyed or bound to the ſacrament, as if the promyſe were not ſuffycient and ſtronge ynough of it ſelfe, but the Sacrament is onely added and put to the promiſe, for a greater confyrmation, namelye, when there is neyther contempte nor neglygence,

and we be out of all doubte that the children of the faithful are ſanctified from their mothers wombe. But theſe haue ſo tyed oure ſaluation to the exterior baptiſme, that they haue willed women to baptiſe children in caſe of neceſſitie as th

Item in baptiſme we be ſo regenerated by the vertue of that whiche is there figured to vs, that oryginall ſinne, that is to ſay oure corrupt nature, is not imputed to vs to damnation, and yet notwithſtanding, ceaſeth not to be in vs. Althoughe dayly it be quenched, and ſuppreſſed by the vertue of Ieſus Chryſte dwelling in vs. Neuertheleſſe theſe doe not vnderſtand of what importance originall ſinne is. But doe teache that it is vtterly quenched, by the doppyng or ſprinckling outwardely of water, & that it putteth awaye that ſinne wherein we be all ſo culpable that it draweth our lyues to ruine and confuſion. And ſo attributing that to the water which appertaineth

to the only bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, repreſented by the ſame.
                  
                  
                     Of the Supper.
                     Concerning the holy Supper of the Lord, what deſolation is there in all the Papiſtrie? It is requiſite that there be ſignes for to repreſent the thing ſignified, otherwiſe it can be no Sacramente, as we haue amply and largely declared. But theſe aboliſh the ſignes, ſaying that there is neyther breade nor wine, but onely the whiteneſſe and ſauoure of breade and wyne, wherein they vtterly abolyſhe the proportion, whiche is betwéene the ſignes, and the thing repreſented by them.
                     The coniunction of the thyng ſignyfied wyth the ſignes, dependeth on the onely ordynaunce and promiſſe of God, wtout being either locall, or in any wiſe natural. But ſo only as God offreth to vs verytably, that whiche he promyſeth to vs by his worde, and repreſenteth to

oure ſenſe by vyſible ſignes, that is to ſay, the verie bodie and bloude of Ieſus Chryſte, to euerlaſtyng lyfe. But theſe on the contrarie, wil haue by the vertue of foure or fyue wordes, the breade to be chaunged into the bodye, and the Wyne into the bloude of Ieſus Chryſte, which is a verie Iuglyng or Sorcerie. For in ſo ſaying, they deſtroy by conſequent, the humanytie of Ieſus Chryſte. If they alleadge furthermore, that God is Almyghtie, the annſwere is ſoone made. For there is no queſtion to know whether God can, (for we doubt not but hée can do all) but whether he wyll or not. Nowe that he wyll not, it appeareth by thys, that he hath not declared it by hys worde. But on the contrarie, it is ſaide,Act. 1. &. 
                              •
                           . that Ieſus Chryſte hath taken hys body from vs into heauen, & ſhall not remoue from thence, vntil he come to Iudge the quick & the deade. Although concerning his diuine nature and vertue he is ouer all. Moreouer when Ieſus Chryſte dyd take a verie body, he dyd ſufficiently

declare that he woulde not be inuiſible, nor infinite concerning hys diuine nature, as he ſayd to his Apoſtles. Finally if they alledge that the bodie of Ieſus Chryſt is now gloryfied, the anſwere is peremptorie, that whē the Lord inſtituted thys ſacrament, his body was not as then gloryfied. And neuertheleſſe hys wordes were then as true and veritable, as they be now at this day: wherfore their ſaying is to no purpoſe, for the glorification, maketh but one bodye, to become one infinite thing, for it appertayneth but to one God to be infinite.
                     The ordinaunce of God ought to be playnely declared, and expounded in the miniſtration of the ſacramentes, according to his word, otherwiſe no faith can be there. But theſe haue wrapped the ordinance & word of the ſupper, among a number of things, vtterly contrarie to it, for to turn away the people from that whiche they oughte chiefly to conſider. Alſo they ſay nothing, but in an vnknowen language to the moſte parte: and

finally muche leſſe expounde they any thing, but on the contrarie, they enforce themſelues to ſpeake at that tyme baſeſt and ſofteſte, ſo that then it ſéemeth they blow rather than ſpeake. And then they haue done their greate conſecration, by reaſon wherof they eſtéeme themſelues more worthy than the Virgin Mary, for (ſay they) the virgin Mary did but beare Ieſus Chryſt, but we make him.
                     The ſupper is the Sacrament of the communion of the faythful, as wel with Ieſus Chryſt, as one with another: but theſe againſt the expreſſe word of god, againſte the nature, and the ende for whiche this Sacramente was inſtituted, againſte all the cuſtome of the auncient1▪ Cor. 11. Church, haue changed it into their baſe Maſſes, and particular Maſſes, from whence ſhortely after, were hatched and ſprong vp this gret and horrible multitude of Maſſing Prieſtes.
                     We oughte to come to the Supper, there to receyue in our owne perſons by fayth, the body and bloude of our onely

Sauiour. But theſe gyue in their Maſſes neyther breade nor Wyne, but eate vp all themſelues (for all the Paryſhe as they ſay.) But put the caſe that theyr Sacrament were a true Sacramente, where fynd they that the ſacraments do profite them whych receyueth them not, or whether one maye receyue it by aCap. reiecta conſecratione. diſ. 2. d. conſecrat in decret. Note this wel. Proctoure? But what ſay they to Calixte one of their Popes, whych woulde that al they ſhoulde be excommunicated, whiche be founde at Maſſe, not communicating the Sacramente wyth the Prieſt.
                     Alſo we ought to come to the Supper of the Lorde, to the ende to receyue Ieſus Chryſte to euerlaſting lyfe, by the vertue of the oblation, whiche he once made of hymſelfe. Theſe on the contrarie, what ſay they that they doe at their Maſſe? They offer Ieſus Chryſt to God his father, for the quick & for the deade. Now if this be true, where is this only oblation of Ieſus Chryſt, where is alſo his hie prieſthood, & by conſequent, wher

is the onely hope of our Saluation? God hath inſtituted two Sacramentes, that is to ſay, breade and wyne. Theſe of their own authoritie (beſyde that in their hye and lowe Maſſes there is no communion, no when they kéepe their Eaſter, as they call it) haue taken away the vſage of Wyne, from all thoſe whiche they call lay people. And they cannot deny, but it is againſt the expreſſe ordinaunce of God, and againſt the cuſtome of all the auncient Chryſtian Churche.

                     The Sacrament of the bodye, and the Sacrament of the bloude, were ordayned ſeuerally, and namely the bread oughte to be broken to be dyſtributed. But theſe in the Sacryfice of their Maſſe, (where as I haue ſayde before there is no Communion, and conſequently no Sacrament of the Supper,

                     The effect of the Sacrament, concerning the coniunction of the ſigne wyth the thing ſignified, dependeth vppon the onely ordinaunce of God, lawfully obſerued and miniſtred. And theſe contrarywiſe tyeth and byndeth their conſecration, to the intention of him whiche dothe conſecrate, ſo that no man can be aſſured, whether he be an Idolater, or no, in worſhypping of that whiche they would haue to be worſhypped. For if the intent for to conſecrate be not in the Prieſt, they ſay themſelues there is but bread. Nowe to woorſhip breade is very Idolatrie. But who canne be aſſured of the intent of the Prieſt, conſidering that men know for the moſt part, what people they be?

                  IT appeareth by this aboue ſayde, that there is neyther worde of God purely declared, nor prayers duely made, neyther Sacramentes ryghtly admyniſtred in the papiſtrie. But all is notoriouſly reuerſed and chaunged, which be neuertheleſſe the verie ſubſtantiall and true markes of the Chriſtian church, as hath ben ſaid. It foloweth that the Papiſtes, or otherwiſe the Romiſhe Churche, be in no wiſe the holy Catholike Churche, that is to ſaye vniuerſall: the whyche wée doe beléeue: for as muche as God hath euer preſerued and kept his church,

as was aunſwered to Elias, in the time of the reuolting of the ten Trybes of Iſraell.
                  But bycauſe they alleadge to vs the ſucceſſion of the Apoſtles, as if that were a ſure argument, it muſte be ſéene of what force thys reaſon is, at the leaſt in the gouernemente whyche they call the eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie. Fyrſte I ſaye, they preſuppoſe a foundation vtterly falſe, that is to wit, the Churche to be ioyned or tyed to a certaine nation ſée, or place, conſydering that all the Scripture, and the experience of that we ſée wyth oure eyes, be all together contrary.
                  Secondlye, theſe whyche enter not by the doore of the houſe, be not called paſtoures, neyther ſucceſſours of true paſtours, although they occupy the ſame places, but rather robbers & theues: And it is not ordayned that falſe paſtoures or Prophets ſhould be obayed as ſucceſſoures of Prophets. But we muſte take heede, and ſeparate oure ſelues

from euerie one, that teacheth any other doctrine than this of God. Alſo S. Paule ſayd, that he is accurſed, and to be cut off from the Churche, whych ſhoulde bring any other Goſpell (that is to ſay any other doctrine of Saluation) than his. He excepteth not the Angels: but he paſſeth further, and propheūeth that thoſe which ſhoulde do thus, ſhoulde ſit in the Temple of God, that is to ſay, ſhould hold the place of Paſtours and Elders. And S. Iohn declareth ſufficiently in hys Apocalips, that it ſhoulde be namely within Rome, as the auncient writers haue vnderſtand it.
                  And for to ſhewe in fewe wordes, there is not one among them from the greteſt to the leſt, which after this reckning is not a robber and a theefe, if the word of Ieſus Chriſte maye take place, I ſay not one excepted, as their Prouiſions, Preſentations, Collations, Signatures, Bulles, Mandates, Preuentions, Dates, Conſentes, Permutations, Concordates,

When Looke the. 6 leſſon of the counſell of Calcedon. Leo the firſt would extoll his preheminence, by his Embaſſadours

Now theſe teſtimonies being moſt true and certain, by what tytle doth he call himſelfe, ſucceſſour of Saint Peter, and heade of the Churche, vnder the ſhadowe of ordynaunces, which they

As hath heretofore bene ſayde, and partlie alſo made by them ſelues, after theyr owne appetyte, agaynſt God and all the auncient decrées, of whome they woulde ſeeme to be the defenders. Or ſhall it be for that about the yeare. 607.

Or ſhall it bee becauſe that Zacharie and Steuen the ſeconde (for the rewarde of theyr cruelties,This was done about the yeare. 752. and infamous treaſons) receyued the ſeigniorie of Italye, whiche they afterward dyd call the patrimony of ſaint Peter? This ſhall ſuffice them for this tyme: for if it be néedefull to enter into further matter, there is well wherewith to banket them of another ſort.
                  Concerning Cardinals, it were néedefull that they ſhoulde fyrſt of all declare

from whence they bee come, the whiche were verye diffycill for them. Certaynly (if we wyll beléeue the godly iuglyng of that Synode, which they haue attrybuted to Sylueſter Pope) theyr natiuitie dyd begin at Conſtanſtine. But there is yet worſſe, then in ſo long a tyme, and in ſo many Counſels, & ſo many bookes of the auncient Doctours, there is made no more mencion of my Lord Cardinals tytles, then if they had neuer béene hatched. Wherefore if there were any then, it muſt appeare that their office & charge was very ſmall. And in déede it is euydently ſene by that which they alledge of Sylueſter, that they were none other but Deacons, that is to ſay, dyſtrybuters of the goodes of the poore, euery one in hys quarter of the Towne of Rome, at that time being deuided in 7. quarters which they called Cardines. It is then no maruayle7. quarters of Rome called Cardines. though they be not named by ſuch thynges as concerne the affayres of the true doctrine, or the gouernement thereof, wherein they are not ſéene, neyther doo they vnderſtande what it meaneth.

But afterwarde when theyr Byſhoppe was exalted. the Prieſts of Rome would alſo bée a lofte: and by this meanes the name of Cardinall was geuen to them, and their authority encreaſed and grew vp: For it was more then reaſon, but that they ſhoulde haue part of the bootye. And for to hyde or diſſimule theyr originall, they haue agreed to be called. Cardinals, as if they were thoſe vpon whom the catholyke Churche were ſtayed, as a gate hangeth vpon his poſt: For Cardo ſignifieth a gate or doore poſte.
                  But they are not determyned to leaue their tytle, ſo long as they adde to them, as Saynt Croſſe, Saynt Sabine, and other. The which declare yet playne their oryginall and firſte offyce. Yet that not withſtandyng, by a long ſpace, it was thought a ſtraunge thing, that a Cardynall of Rome ſhould hold a Biſhoprike, for he could not haue it at Rome, where hée muſt doo hys offyce of Elder, or of Deacon, and ſo féede his flocke. And for to bee a Byſhoppe, and not to preache, was a thyng no leſſe ſtraunge, then to

ſée a Shephearde dwell in a Citie, and be called Shephearde, and to receyue the wages, without kéeping or féeding any Sheepe.
                  Farre was it from theyr cuſtome, to bée abſent from theyr charge and offyce, or to haue a Vicar vnder them: and yet leſſe to kéepe them in the courts of kings and Princes, and to be charged with Abbyes and Byſhoprikes. But after the horrible confuſion was come, then theyr charges and offyces were conuerted into dignities, and my Lorde the Pope deſyred no better, then by theſe traffykes and meanes to entertaine himſelfe with Kings and Princes, euen by the meanes of his Cardinalles, who of good ryght he calleth his Creatures.

                  But truely I agrée with them in one thing, that is to ſay, that their vniuerſall heade (whiche Saynt Gregory calleth Antichriſte) cannot better be choſen then of ſuch an honeſt company. But of one thing I muche maruayle, that ſo many great men of ſo noble and auncient houſes, yea euen Princes, haue thorowe thys curſſed ſonne of perdition béene ſo bewytched, deceyued and poyſoned, to

But to be ſo contamynated with ſuch fylthynes to maintaine that which they ſée and knowe in theyr owne conſciences 
                        •
                     owe euyll it is.
                  Beholde here howe the Pope and his Cardinalles be the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles and Diſciples of▪ Ieſus Chriſte: Concernyng theyr Suffraganes, Officials, Proctours in the Courtes of the Church, Notaries Apoſtolycall, Promoters, Auditors, Bulliſts, Copiſts, Courriers, Vicars, Chaplaynes, Prouoſtes, and other ſuche innumerable vermyne, what can I ſay otherwyſe? For one ſhall find aſſoone the diuel among the Angels, as one worde or mencion of them in the holy ſcripture, or in the auncient Counſels, Decrées, Doctours, Gréekes, or Latines for to approue them. I ſay more,

that it is as poſſyble to accorde theſe eſtates with the true forme of the Chriſtian Churche, as to accorde lyght and darknes, trueth and lyes.
                  I come nowe to the other, which haue more apparence, for as muche as they haue theyr foundation in the ſcrypture: yet notwithſtanding, becauſe they be nothing leſſe, then that whiche they be called, to what purpoſe doeth theſe names ſerue whiche they beare, but the more to condempne them of falſehoodde and deceypt.
                  Wee haue here before declared and ſhewed that there is in all two degrées of Eccleſiaſticall offices, as well for the myniſtration of the woorde of God, as of publyke prayers and Sacramentes, to weete, the offyce of Paſtours and Doctours. Suche was the manner and the cuſtome in all the primatyue Churche. And for as muche as the Paſtoures are deuyded into many degrées, to wéete, Archbyſhoppes, or Metropolytanes, Biſhops, or Curates, this was not onely in reſpecte to the office of the worde, but in

conſyderation of the orderyng of the affayres which concerneth the Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction, of the whiche wee ſhall ſpeake in his place.
                  Wherefore there is in conſideration of the offyce, to myniſter the doctryne of the Goſpell, no dyfference before God, betwéene the Archbiſhop, the Byſhoppe, and the Curate, ſo that eache of them bée Paſtour of their owne flockes. And for this cauſe bee they all named with the common name of Biſhops. So hath Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles both exercyſed and ſpoken, and all their true Succeſſours Mark. 18. Iohn. 15 Acts. 18.. As if they conſider al the auncient Counſels and decrees, concerning the election and the lyfe as wel domeſticall as publike, of thoſe whom we ſpeake of, they ſhall fynde there and perceyue thinges yet more ſtraight. Nowe then is it poſſyble that the ſtubborne impudencie of theſe horned beaſtes ſhoulde come ſo farre, to bee called Succeſſours of the Apoſtles, & vaunt them ſelues of names which appertayneth leaſt to them of any men vnder heauen? For who ſet them

in this eſtate? By what doore be they entered in? Where is the election & examination of all theyr lyfe, according to all right orders both diuine & humaine? Is there one among a hundred of them, that is meete or diſpoſed to thinke only of his charge or offyce, or knoweth certaynly what office and charge he hath, or which onely enquyreth after his flocke? And if there be found one among a hūdred, how doth he occupy himſelfe, but rather to do any other thing, then that which pertayneth to his office? And if of a thouſand Biſhops or Curats in the papiſtry there he founde one which teacheth his people, what doctrine is it but ſuch as is directly againſt the trueth, as we haue declared? And what Sacramentes can hee myniſter, what orders maye he kéepe, where there is nought but all pollution and falſifying of the true ſacramentes, and all abhomynable confuſion, as here before hath bene declared? The prouincial coūſelles, howe be they kept? Nowe many Archbiſhoppes be there? How many Archbiſhoppes be there? How many Biſhoppes be there, meete to dyſcerne and

geue counſell? Concerning Sinodes of euery Dioceſſe, howe bée they practiſed? Wherefore be the Curates called, but to paye theyr tribute and procurations? What aſſemble, what doctrine, or what order is there?
                  But I wyll demaunde of them, according to their own ordinaunces, whether one that is excommunicated, ought not to be reiected, and not to be taken as a member of the Churche? Howe much leſſe then ought he to be a Paſtour? Secondly, I demaunde of them, if he be not ſuffyciently excommunicated, which is notoriouſlye ſuche a one, as are thoſe whiche Ieſus Chriſte and his Apoſtles commaunde to eſchewe as one infected, or full of peſtilence, and whiche be expreſſelye entered and mayntayned in the Churche, againſt all the conſtitutions, and ordinaunces of Counſels, Decrées, and auncient Doctours, conformable to the ſcriptures. Nowe for to know if they bée ſuche, I ſende them, beſyde the Scryptures, whiche wee haue alreadye often tymes alleadged 1. Corin. 9. 1. Timo. 6 to the

Epiſtles 3. and 4. and fourth booke of S. Ciprian, and to the third Treatiſe of the ſame, entituled, The ſimplicitie of Prelates. Item to the Epiſtle 85. of Leo the firſt. Item, to the Canon 4. and 6. of the counſel of Nicene. Item to the Canon 23 and 25. of the counſell of Antioche. Item to the Canon 14. and 15. of the counſell of Sardicque. Item diſti. 23. ca. Cleric

There and other where in an infinite number of textes they ſhall fynde by what title they be called Archbiſhops Byſhops, and Curates, how auayleable the title of their Hierarchie is.
               
               
                  13 The abuſe which is commytted in the ſeconde partie of eccleſiaſticall offyces which be Deacons.
                  COncerning thoſe whiche ought to wayte and watche vppon the doctrine and prayers, let vs come firſt to the diſpenſation of the goodes of the poore, for the which it was declared, that

the Deacons were principallye eſtabliſhed. Alſo in the Papiſtrie, what examination, what election, or what order is there in the making of Deacons, and Subdeacons, what charge alſo is geuen them? Forſoothe to bee able to iuggell in theyr mommerie, to bee aſſiſtaunt at the renouncinge of the ſacrifice and interceſſion of Ieſus Chriſte, as hath bene declared before in the thyrde and fowrth Article, to ſyng a gobbet of the Hiſtory of the Goſpell, or of an Epiſtle in an vnknowen language, and without expoſition, to handell the Challice, to holde the Crewetes, to receyue the offeryng, whereof the poore ſhall haue nothing, to geue the Pax
                        •
                     , to ſaye Ita miſſa eſt in a hye Maſſe. But in what Churche? forſoothe where they maye. And for howe long? Untyll they them ſelues maye be Prieſtes euen the firſt day. And becauſe that long time before he be a Prieſt, that is to weete, before hée haue the office of doctrine, or of eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction, according to the olde Canons, be muſt be for a tyme exerciſed and proned in theſe

baſe offyces. Therefore it was néedefull for theſe Maiſter Apes, to worke ſome inuention for to ſaye they kéepe the auncient decrées. Nowe I praye you theſe thinges conſydered, by what title dare theſe wycked wretches bée called Deacons, againſt the teſtimony of the ſcripture, againſt all the auncient decrées and Doctours? For the which they ſpake of the offyce of the Deacons, in the miniſtration of the Sacrament of the ſupper, howe can it agree with that which is dyrectly againſt it? And eſpecially of Archdeacons, by what tytle are they called by that name, conſyderinge they haue not followed one iotte of their office? And for the admyniſtration of the goodes of the Churche, where is the diſtrybution of fowre partes, ordayned by auncient Counſelles, as it hath bene amplye declared, in the thyrtie Article of the fyfte poynt?
                  From whence commeth that euerye Benefyce as they call it, hath hys reuenue a parte? But that the Lordes coate whiche the Souldiors woulde not

teare, is by them parted into infinyte peeces?
                  Where is the fowrth parte committed to the Byſhoppe, and howe is it dyſtributed? I report mée to theyr whoores, to Bawdes, to Dogges, to Hawkes, Popengayes and Byrdes, to Horſes and Cookes. Where be the Cleargye that ought to be noriſhed with his fowrth portion? But rather in what Churche haue they any learned Clarkes or Schollers? I report mée to the Cathedrall Churches and Collegyalles, as they doo call them, where the bootye and ſpoyle is parted. Where is the fowrth parte of the poore? I reporte mée to thoſe whiche kéepe the accoumptes of Hoſpytalles, howe muche they be holpen by the part of thoſe which haue the goods of the Churches?
                  Where is the fowrth part for the reparation, not of theyr ſuperfluous Palaces, vnméete for Chriſtian men, and yet leſſe for the entertaynement of ſuch horryble Idolatries? But to mayntayne the buyldynges neceſſarye for the congregations, I report mée to thoſe that

ſée it. Beholde in ſumme the godly order of this Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchie in theſe poyntes.
               
               
                  14 Of the abuſe which is commytted in the order of Prieſthoode, and in the gouernment of theyr ſpirituall iuriſdiction.
                  IF it bée néedefull to ſpeake of the abuſe whiche is commytted in the thyrde part of Eccleſiaſticall offyces, of the which hath bene ſpoken in the fifte poynt, in the Artycles. 32. 33. 34. and other following, by what ende maye we begynne to enter into ſo great a confuſion?
                  Fyrſt, by what authoritie haue they chaunged (for the moſte parte) the nature of the ſpyrituall iuriſdiction of the Churche into a m
                        •
                     ere temporalitie, appertayninge onelye to the Ciuyll Magiſtrate, by all ryght both diuine and humaine?
                  Secondly, although the Prieſtes or Elders be eſpecially ordained to do their

offyce by Gods woorde, from whence commeth it, that it is ſo out of vſe in all the Papacie? For I doubt not of that I ſpeake, and alſo it is manyfeſt throughout the Scripture, and by all the auncient Counſelles and Doctours, that thoſe which be called Prieſtes at this daye, be no more lyke that they beare the name of, then blacke is lyke whyte. For after theyr manner, what is it to bée a Prieſt? It is to haue authoritie to Sacrifice and to offer vp Ieſus Chriſte for the quycke and for the deade: that is to ſaye, in one worde, to turne the rootes vpwarde, as much as in them is, of all the grounde of our ſaluation, as in other places hath bene ſayde. And from thence is it ſprong that of Gouernours, they haue made hyreling Sacrificers for wages. And ſo there is become two ſortes of Prieſtes, that is to weete the Beneficed, and the poore hyrelinges, whiche lyue vnder the other, and bée more buſyed in offeringes aſwell in their dayly butchery for mony, as Iudas was, as alſo affyrming theyr office to ſaue and dampne for money, yea

of thoſe which be ſo occupyed to dampne them ſelues, that they are forced to haue Uicars vnder them to dampne others. And to aduaunce this occupation, they muſte yet haue goodlye Bulles and Diſpenſations, to dyſtribute to all that commeth, paying honeſtly for it: to the ende that thoſe which lyue to eate vp, deuour, and dampne all the worlde, as muche as in them lyeth, alſo maye deuour and dampne one another by priuiledge. For truelye it is eaſye to ſée in this confuſion whiche is apparaunt to all the worlde, and to thoſe whiche bée of the beſt of them, if theyr bellye doo not ouercome theyr conſciences, that the Diuell fyndeth hym ſelfe as it were combered and ouerladen to receyue ſo manye at once, and woulde inuent ſome maner of way, that eache maye come in bys ranke and order, drawing and tollyng after him his companie: a thyng certaynly moſte miſerable and pitifull amongſt the Chriſtian people.
                  Notwithſtanding, who hath this iuriſdiction whiche deuowreth the quycke

and the deade, vnder the name of the Churche? I wyll not enter here into the great bottomleſſe court of Rome, but I leaue it to be ſcanned to Saint Barnard in his bookes De conſideratione, to Pope 
                        ••
                     gene: although that which they then dyd, was nothyng, in reſpecte of this whiche is nowe. But I wyll ſpeake of the Ordinarie.
                  Fyrſt, my Lorde Byſhoppe, maiſter Offyciall, maiſter Uicar, theyr Promoters, Procurers, and ſuche lyke haue taken the place of my maiſters the Sacrificers. On the other ſide, the Canons as well in theyr Chapiter, as in theyr dygnities Capitularies, lykewyſe haue taken theyr part▪ Nowe for the firſt, that is the Officialles and their ſequell, who hath ſet them in thys degrée? Truelie. the ſame Spyrite that doeth conducte them, as the experyence declareth. For as I haue ſayde in other places, it was not poſſyble to haue brought them into the Churche of God, vntyll they had driuen him out, which is the onely maiſter, euen our Chriſt. And there is neyther

holye Scripture, neyther Counſell, nor Decrée, nor any auncient Doctor whiche euer dyd know ſuch monſters.
                  Concerning Chapiters, there is ſome more apparaunce: For the name onelye of Cannons, and Prebendes declareth that they haue ſuccéeded in the Cleargie, of thoſe that were noriſhed of the fowrth parte of the goodes of the Church, among whome were choſen wyllinglie, thoſe whiche were employed to charge an office, and to thoſe whiche had with the Biſhop the ſpiritual gouernment, wher of hath béene ſpoken in the. 32. Artycle of the fyfte poynt. But notwithſtanding what is the office of Canons? trulie nothing leſſe then to gouerne a Church? For namely, the Biſhoppes woulde neuer ſuffer them, and in déede they coulde not. And if we ſhall come to ſpeake of the lyues of thoſe Gentlemen, I woulde knowe if there be any man that hath his naturall wytte, that can tell what dyfference there is betweene the moſt part of Cannons and the Hogges. This queſtion auoyded, they ſhall haue a reſpecte

what order they keepe in their Hierarchye.
                  It hath bene ſpoken of the perſonne of thoſe Lordes the gouernours of the Church who hauing ſo good a foūdation▪ it is eaſie to perceyue what may be theyr gouernment.
                  Fyrſte if they woulde, or dyd vnderſtande howe to doo it, were it lawfull for them, or eyther Archbyſhoppe or Byſhoppe to reforme the doctrine? No, for that appertayneth to the Theologians and Diuines. And as for them I confeſſe they bee no ſuche. And certaynlie there may be perceyued in the ſame onelye the iuſte Iudgement of GOD, agaynſte thoſe whiche haue contempned ſo excellent an offyce, as to declare the the ſecréetes of GOD to men. Yet the Archebyſhoppes and Byſhoppes whiche onelye wyll haue theyr voyce delyberatiue in the Counſelles, notwithſtanding muſte come behynde bothe in ſyght and knowledge, of thoſe whiche haue not remooued out of the puddell of one popyſhe ſchoole, and ought of right themſelues to

be ordered by the Byſhoppes, accordinge to all good order. For where was it euer ſéene that the Doctour (put the caſe that ſuch were Doctours, which neyther
                        
                           •
                         To the Sorboniſts doctours of Paris, and Inquiſitors of Spaine. haue doctryne, neyther flocke to teache) ſhoulde go before the Paſtour? And yet notwithſtanding, ſome of theſe Gentlemen, taketh no leſſe vppon them ouer their natiue kyngdomes. Yea the Pope him ſelfe, attrybuting to them the knowledge of doctrine in ſuche wyſe, that it is not lawfull for to gaynſaye them, vnder paine to bée iudged and puniſhed for an heretike.
                  Concernyng manners, who is hee that wyll meddle with it among them? For there is nothinge in the worlde that they feare more, and principallye in that whiche concerneth the ſeruice of GOD. For they can doo no otherwyſe without periurie, then to mayntayne and augment all the tyrannye of the Romyſhe courte.
                  Concerning elections, howe is it among them vtterly aboliſhed, and chaunged into this horryble and abhominable

marchandiſe of Symonie, whereof hath bene ſpoken here before, and eſpeciallye, in the elections of Canons & Moonkes, as they bée accuſtomed to elect? Who ſhall call this a lawfull election, where as is not but an open moſt execrable poluting of that which is required in the true elections, according to the word of God, and all the auncient decrées?
                  Concerning confyrmations of Offycers elected, what other thyng is it then a very apiſh playe, from the hyeſt degrée whiche is the Metropolytane, vnto the laſt whiche is to bee receyued into the Clergie?
                  As for Eccleſiaſtycall cauſes, and namely in corrections, where is the Eccleſiaſticall Senate? Where is the lawfull iudgement to teache the ignoraunt, to call ſynners with meekeneſſe lowly to repentaunce? Where is the woorde of God? Where is the auncient Counſelles and Cannons, for to vanquiſhe and conuince Heretickes? Which bee thoſe that haue the charge and offyce to excommunicate?
                  
                     Where be the perſons excommunicated? What be the cauſes Excommuncation? How be they ordered? What abſolutions haue they? What ſatiſfactions to the Church? Hereby ye may plainly ſée what their Succeſſion and Hierarchy is, of which they boaſt ſo much, and conſequently what is the whole gouernment of the Church.
                  
                     ¶ Of Moonkes.
                     If the name of Moonkes (that is to ſay ſolytarie) be not ſufficient to declare that thoſe whiche at this daye be named Moonkes, bee nothing leſſe then that which they bée called, there bée other reaſons ſufficient for to conuince them. For auncient Monaſteryes were as Collegies, into the whiche men reſorted for two cauſes. Fyrſt, the better to bée at quiet to ſtudie the Scriptures. The ſecond to exerciſe patience, and auſteritie of lyfe. Not withſtanding, it was not to be ſtrayned and bounde to one place during lyfe without exception. But contrarywyſe

to bée the more méete to ſerue the Churches, when they ſhoulde be called and elected thereto, as it appeareth by Gregorye Naziancene, Baſile, and Chryſoſtome, and namely in Saynt Auguſtine Epi. 76. & 82.. To be ydle, or not to worke with the handes was intollerable: for on the contrarie they lyued onely by the labour of theyr owne handes, yea and they dyd geue the reſt of theyr labour to the poore. So that a Moonke not trauayling for his lyuing, was eſtéemed as a Theefe Hiſtori. tripertit. 1. booke., according to the rule of ſaint Paule 1. Theſ. 3. Auguſt. de moribus eccle. catho. Cap. 3. & de opera monacorum.. And to put ſaluation partlie or altogether in their abſtinances, howe extréeme or hard ſo euer they were, they neuer thought it. For they knew very well what it was that Saint Paule had wrytten of that poynte 1. Timo. 4.. Moreouer Saint Auguſtine teſtifyeth Augu. de moribus eccl. cath. capi. 33 and ſayth. Let none be oppreſſed aboue his power, leaſte there bee ſuperſtition in the abſtynence of meate: for the weake refuſing foolyſhlie the vſe of Wine, were admoniſhed brotherly, that by their ſuperſtition they brought them ſelues rather more

weake, then holy.
                     It appeareth moreouer by that which Saint Ciprian Firſt booke 11. Epiſt. ſayde, that it were better for the Vyrgins which were dedycated by promyſe to God (that is to wéete, to the ſeruyce of the poore, and not to bée ydle in Coouentes) if they woulde not, or coulde not continue, that they ſhoulde marry, rather then fall into the fyre and burne by theyr delyghtes, as alſo Saynt Paule hath ordayned 
                           
                              •
                           . Timo. 5.. If this be vereſie, Saynt Cyprian muſt bée an heretike. Neuertheles, ye may ſée the maner of the auncient Monaſtaries, whereunto what ſhall wée fynde lyke or agréeing in theſe ſtynckinge corners, or dennes full of all ſuperſtition. apyſhneſſe, blaſphemies, enuyes, treaſons, dronkenneſſe, ambitions, Sodomyes, poyſonynges, and all other ſtyncking fylthyneſſe, ſo ſtyncking, that they them ſelues cannot endure it, which appeared long ſince, and ſproonge vp by lytle and lytle. For Saynt Chriſoſtome had no greater enemies, then ſuche falſe Moonkes and Fryars, runnyng by the ſtreetes from town to towne, and namely

of theſe which be called Mendicantes. Is it not maruayle that the Cardynals, and namely among others, hée that was Pope of late, named Paule the fowrthe, is not ſet aſyde, and all their tayle is not ſent agayne to the Diuell, from whence they came? For beholde their owne proper wordes, in the booke which they dyd offer to Pope Paule the thyrde, in the yeare. 1538. Intituled, Concilium delectorum Cardinalium, mendicantium ordines tollendos cenſemus omnes, that is to ſaye: We are of that opinion, that all the orders of Mendicantes, or beggyng Fryars ought to bée aboliſhed. Although a certayne Fryar of late dayes bathe Imprynted a Booke of the Counſelles, and hath put in Conuentuales ordines, that is to ſaye, the orders Couentuels. It maye be thought hee dyd it to ſaue his owne order. But what néede is it to enter into theſe puddelles? Trulye they muſt needes be vtterlye blynde, which ſeeke not onelye Chriſtianitie, but alſo the perfection of Chriſtianity in ſuch an hell,
                     
                        But for this time, to the ende we may declare what tytle they haue to meddle with preaching, or with any manner of Eccleſiaſticall charge or office, I wyll deſire them of fowre thinges.
                     The fyrſte is, if euer they haue bene compted, but among thoſe which they cal the Laitie euer ſince the Church was reformed, let them declare.
                     The ſeconde, let them deny and they can during the time, namely of Gregory the fyrſt that to be of the Cleargie, and a Moonke, were thinges intollerable Gregori. 3. booke. 11. Epiſt. except he renounced the Moonkerie. But during ſuche tyme all Eccleſiaſtycall affayres of theirs were interdited.
                     The thyrde, they deny that they bée ſubiectes to the Biſhop within their Dioceſſe,i Canon. 4. of the. 15. leſſon of the vniuerſall counſell of Chalcedon. by the generall counſell of Chalcedon, one of the whiche they themſelues compare to the fowre Euangeliſts. And if they alleadge their Priueledge of exemption, let them ſhewe that the holye ghoſt doth euer deny or gainſay himſelf, or that the Pope can abolyſh the decrées

of a generall counſell ratified and approued ſo many tymes, and ſo autentike.
                     The fowrth, let them declare if there be any idle monke, that is to ſay which doth not his good wyll to get his liuing; which is not an Apoſtata and periured, by the contents and rules of his owne order.
                     Theſe points anſwered it wyl be time to conſyder what order they ought to keepe in their goodly Hierarchy.
                  
               
               
                  15 The Papiſts be manifeſtly culpable of rebellion againſt the magiſtrate.
                  THe impudentie of thoſe whiche burden vs to be rebelles againſt kings, Princes, or other Magiſtrates, is to much, and to extréeme. For concerning our doctrine, it is cleane contrary, as we haue declared in the ſixt poynt. And for experience, wee make Iudges (with our Princes and Lords) all the whole world, yea euen our cruell perſecutours. But if there be Anabaptiſts & lybertines, which do 
                        •
                     owe abroade the contrarie to defame the verity of the goſpell, be we in ye fault? It is we onely that at this day do ſtryue & inueigh againſt them, more firmly and

lyuely then all the reſt of the world. But what neede is it in this caſe to attrybute it to the Anabaptiſtes?

               ¶ The concluſion of that is aforeſayde.
               
               THeſe things conſydered, I hope by the grace of God, that all men of a ſounde iudgement, may eaſily know by the conference, aſwell of the doctrine, as of the exterior gouernement, on which ſyde the verity of God doth ſtande, and what ſlanders they bring vpon vs, againſt all reaſon. Wherefore we requyre in the name of God, thoſe which by ignorance hetherto haue perſecuted the innocents, to haue more regarde to them ſelues, and to the iudgement of God, which is to come. If they be kinges, Princes, or other noble and worſhypfull men, that they wyll ſo much the more bee dillygent to heare the verity, which only may make them long time & haply to raign: and alſo take héede of thoſe which vnder a falſe ſemblance of Relygion doo abaſe and bring vnder the ſcepters and crownes of kinges, to theyr boods, hats, miters, and croſſes: yea ſo far as to make them ſerue to their inſatiable couetouſneſſe and extréeme crueltye. If

they be Iudges and magiſtrates, let them conſider for the honor of God, that when they ſhal come to render a count of theyr iudgementes, it ſhalbe a poore defence or excuſe for thē agaynſt the wrath of God, to alledge that they haue hen but the mynyſters of the lawes and ſtatutes which them ſelues dyd not make. This is the excuſe of ſuch as doo ſet other a worke to ſhed innocent bloud. If they be priuate perſons, let them vnderſtand that where ther is no vnderſtanding or godly knowledge to render a reaſon of his fact, there can be no zeale of God, but a very wilful rygour, for the whiche they ſhall geue accomptes. And at the leaſt let them take the leyſour to conferre the lyues of thoſe vppon whome they haue béene ſo cruell (without vnderſtanding) and what was theyr caſe with thoſe other whiche haue prouoked them to be polluted with innocent bloud: and by that meanes they ſhall iudge the tree according to the fruit.
               Concerning thoſe whiche by a wylfull malice haue conſpired againſt the trueth and extende all theyr power to anymate

and ſturre vp kings and princes againſt vs, but the onelye Lorde hath kepte his Churche againſt theyr rage and fury betherto, and wyll do to the worldes ende.
               Notwithſtanding, let them enterpriſe and doo all that they may, & doo the worſt to vs they can. Which is to cutte vs of and deſtroye vs vtterlye: for that is the beſt we hope to haue at their hands. But if it pleaſe the Lorde they ſhall winne no other thing, but in deſpyte of them our poore Paper in the ende ſhall quenche their fyres, our pennes ſhall breake their ſwords in their hands, our patience ſhall vanquiſhe their crueltie, and they ſhall ſée with their eyes, that trueth ſhall haue the victorie, and their wicked kingdome ouerthrowen. For it muſt néedes be, wyl they, nyll they, that this worde pronounced by the Sonne of God be fulfylled, euerie plant which my heauenly Father hath not planted, ſhalbe pluckt vp: ſuche is that fayth for the whiche we ſuffer, in the which we nowe lyue in, and hope to dye, to lyue for euer.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            Another briefe confeſsion of fayth, according to the ſame herebefore and the ſame authour.
            
            FOr aſmuch as God is perfectlye ryghtI wyſe and iuſt, and all men wholy and altogether ſinners, then out of theſe two thynges muſt néedes be, that eyther God muſt renounce his ryghteouſnes and iuſtice which cannot be, or all men without exception be vtterly loſt and condemned, except they ſatiſfie fullye, and perfectlye the diuine iuſtice.
            But he ſatiſfyeth perfectly the diuineII iuſtyce, which payeth all that be oweth to God. Wherefore we muſt fyrſt ſeeke what it is that man oweth to God, & then whether he be able to pay him, thyrdly if we cannot finde in our ſelues wherwith to paye him, we muſt ſee then where wée may borowe to paye, that we peryſh not by the iuſt iudgement of God.
            Wherfore to the ende we may knoweIII what it is that man oweth to God, wée muſt conſider the forme and manner of

the oblygation wherein we be bounde in our creation, and what is wrytten in the two tables of the lawe, and then we ſhall fynde that we are bounde to loue God aboue all thynges, and with all our harte, and our neyghbour as our ſelues. So it is aparent that we owe to be payed perfecte loue to God and to our neyghbours.
            But howe can this be done, if fyrſt weIIII be not naturally apte and enclyned to doo thys? For experyence teacheth that our nature is cleane contrary to this. For all men of them ſelues or of theyr owne wyll be enclyned rather to hate God and theyr neyghbor, contrary to loue. Nowe if our owne nature draweth vs to hate, howe can we paye the loue which we doo owe?
            Of this we maye gather thrée concluſions,V that is to ſaye, that all men of theyr owne nature be haters of God being corrupted. Then it foloweth that they cannot onely paye that they do owe, but alſo they bynde them ſelues daylye more and more, and endebte them ſelues by newe ſinnes to the iuſt iudgemēt of God, from

whence it followeth neceſſarily, that eyther all men without exception muſt bée condempned, or elſe fynde ſome one that wyll paye theyr debtes.
            Nowe where ſhall we fynde ſuche aVI pledge or ſuretye that is méete and able to doo it. Certaynlye in no place among the thynges that be created. For if wée ſearche among the Angels, the aunſwere is ready, the Angelles bée not bounde for the ſynne of man. For the ryghteouſnes of God cannot demaunde of the Angelles that which man oweth. And alſo there is ſturred vp the wrathe of God whiche muſt bée borne: and it is certayne that the Angelles them ſelues be not able to beare ſo great a burden.
            But if Angels be inſufficient and vnableVII to beare ſo great a burden, what creature can bee founde that is able to do it? Wherefore we muſt neceſſarily haue refuge to ſome one that is more mightye then all creatures, and alſo that muſt bée very man. For if he be not more myghtyer then any creature, that is to ſay, verye God, he can not beare the burden of

the wrath and yre of God, but ſhould him ſelf be ouerwhelmed vnder it, then much leſſe could he ſatiſfye for others. And if he be not a man, how ſhould he delyuer man by his ſatiſfaction? It is neceſſarie then that a mediatour be founde which is God and man, and ſuch one is Ieſus Chriſt, as the Chriſtian religion teacheth vs.
            Now let vs ſée whether Ieſus ChriſtVII be ſuch one that we may fynde in him all that is requiſite to our ſaluation. Fyrſt Ieſus Chriſte is very God, from whence it foloweth that he can be a ſauionr.
            And alſo be is very man, from whenceVIII it followeth that hée is of nature méete to ſuffer that whiche the Iuſtice of God requyreth to be reuenged for the ſinne of man. For if be onely were God he coulde ſuffer nothing, and if he were only man, he ſhould ſinke vnder the burden of Gods wrath. Becauſe he is God and man, therfore he was able to dye, and vanquyſhe death in dying.
            Moreouer, for aſmuch as be is manIX moſt pure and moſt holy conceiued by the holy ghoſt, this purity being perfect, pleaſeth

God. Wherefore we haue in Ieſus Chriſte, a man agréeable & pleaſing vnto God. Nowe out of this puritie ſpringeth two Ryuers, as out of the fountayne or ſpring, that is to ſaye, a perfect righteouſneſſe, and a whole and perfect abſtayning from ſinne▪ For Ieſus Chriſt very man bath fulfilled all the wyll of God, for as much as hee neuer ſinned in any manner wyſe. Therefore be is moſt iuſt & righteous before God, aſwel becauſe of this naturall puritie, as of the fruites ſprynging out of the ſame purity and cleanes.
            Wherefore we maye with good ryghtX conclude, that we doo fynde onelye in Ieſus Chriſt perfect remedie againſt all the euyls that doth or mought feare our conſcience, or let vs from comming to the glory of God, or might cauſe vs iuſtly to be condempned to eternall death.
            But yet neuertheles we muſt ioygne aXI condition to this, that is to ſaye, if we doo take or ioyne to vs theſe remedies in Ieſus Chriſt. For as it profiteth not a ſicke perſon to haue a good medicine except bee vſe it, nor a hungry man to be at a tables

end garniſhed with plenty of good meats except he eate of them: lykewiſe be there medies of Ieſus Chriſte againſt ye wrath of God and eternal death ſet before vs in vain, except we vſe them. Now we cānot vſe them, except firſt we knowe by what maner, & after what ſort it may be done. Wherefore firſt we muſt ſee how Ieſus Chriſt is, & may be applied to our profit & aduantage. Then to declare how IeſusXII Chriſt may be applied to our ſaluation & eternall lyfe, we wyl vſe this preface. As it is not in our power to finde a medicine of ſaluation▪ ſo cā we not find the maner how to vſe this medicine. For as in the ſicknes of the body, the ſick perſon is paſt al hope of health & vtterly diſpaired, then it is needful for the Phiſition not onely to find and prepare the medicine, but alſo to diſpoſe the ſick perſon ſo as he wyl & may vſe this medicin, and y• he may vnderſtād howe to vſe it: ſo the ſicknes of the ſoule, which is moſt precious aboue althings, & in the which mankind is not onely ignorant, but alſo enemies of their owne ſaluation, then we muſt vnderſtande by the Phiſition of the ſoule what is the medicine,

then after what maner it muſt be vſed, yea & in ſuch wiſe y• the ſame Phiſition do prepare & make vs apt and meete y• we both will and cā vſe thoſe remedies which he prepareth and apoynteth to vs.
            God then is he which in the beginningXIII of the world ſpake by his Angels to y• firſt man, y• is to ſay, Adam and others vntyll Moſes, declaring to them the only remedy of ſaluation, as before is declared, that is to wéete Ieſus Chriſt, in whom onely we find all y• is needful and requiſit to ſaluation. And after the reiecting of al other natiōs & people made apoyntment wt the poſterity of Abraham, & multiplied them exceedinglye & expoūded to them his wyll moſt abūdantly, as it is cōpriſed in the. x commaundementes of God. & alſo ioyned therto certain ſacrifices and ceremonies, the which dyd not only deuyde the people of God frō al other nations, but alſo were certain teſtimonies of Chriſtes coming▪ & of all the things that he ſhould ſuffer, for to delyuer vs from the wrath of God: ſo y• they myght certaynly truſt and beléeue in hym whiche they hoped ſhoulde come.

Moreouer, becauſe God knewe that the diuel would moue & ſtyrre vp falſe Prophets which woulde ſpreade foorth theyr lies as the true cōmaundements of God, he wylled Moyſes and the Prophetes to wryte all that God reuealed to them, to the ende that the falſe Prophetes ſhoulde not ſo eaſily deceyue the people.
            But in the end when ye tyme was comeXIII which he had eternally appoynted according to his eternall & infinite wiſedome, he ſent downe and preſented from Heauē his promiſe, that is to ſay, his eternall ſonne, the which tooke vppon him a verye humaine body, by the vertue of the holye ghoſt, of the ſubſtance of the virgin Mary of the ſéede of Abraham and of Dauid, with the whiche body God conioygned a moſt pure and moſt holy ſoule, created by the ſame force of the holy ghoſt. He was made the very mediatour as is ſayde before, and hath truly fulfilled & accomplyſhed all that was neceſſary to be fulfilled for to reconcyle man vnto God.
            But in the ende when all theſe thingsXIII were fulfilled, Ieſus Chriſte aſcended vp

into heauen, and wylled this doctrine not onelye to bee preached by mouth of the Apoſtles & Euangeliſts, but alſo that theyr handes ſhoulde wryte it in ſuche wyſe, as the Church ſhould haue to the ende of the worlde one certayne doctrine, vppon the which ſhe might ſtay & reſt, and alſo by it might ſeparate moſte clearely the lyes of the falſe Prophets and Antichriſts from the only verity of God, which is comprehēded wholy and perfectly in the bookes of the olde and new teſtaments, ſo that it is not lawfull to chaunge any thing, eyther adde to it, or take from it.
            Moreouer this doctrine had bene written in vayne, if it were not preached and declared faythfully. And man cannot endure nor ſuſtayne the face of God or of Angelles. And God hauing pittie of the ſeede of man, in this poynt hath ordained and conſtytuted Paſtours and Teachers in his Church, by whome he wylled that this doctryne ſhoulde be faythfully declared and applyed to the neceſſyties of the Church publykely and partycularly, that man ſhoulde not alledge any ignoraunce

of the wyll of God.
            Wherefore to the ende I may comprehende all theſe things in few wordes, we learne by the mouth of the faithfull Miniſters of God, which declare his woorde to the church, al that we haue heretofore declared to be neceſſarie to vnderſtande our myſerie and our ſaluation. And for as much as when the word of God is preached vnto man, it is as if they ſpake vnto inſenſible ſtones, therfore we muſt know that as God worketh to the external ſenſes by his woorde pronounced by his Miniſters, euen ſo hee worketh inwardly by his infinite power, that is to ſaye, by hys holy ſpirit, whoſe office conſiſteth in theſe effectes here following.
            Fyrſt, that as this parte of Scripture (which is called the law) teſtifieth to our eares, that wée bée moſt myſerable ſinners deſeruing eternal death, euen ſo the holy ghoſt teacheth the ſame, and ſixeth it in our conſciences (whiche otherwyſe were dull and inſenſyble) and maketh that we bée touched with the true & perfect féeling of our ſinnes, which is the firſt

ſtep or degrée to ſaluation, as in the ſickneſſe of the bodye, it is needefull aboue all thynges, for the recouering of health, to knowe that we be ſicke, and howe greeuous our ſickneſſe is, and what maner of ſickneſſe it is.
            The ſeconde effect or worke of the holy ghoſt is vtterly contrary to this aforeſayde. For it afflyeteth vs, becauſe it declareth to vs our damnation by the law, and how the hels be open to deuoure vs. But this agayne doth comfort vs, when the certayne and onelye remedy of ſaluation is applyed to our conſcience, which is declared vnto vs by the other parte of the ſcripture which is called the Goſpell, that is to ſaye, the happy and bleſſed meſſage of ſaluation fréely in Ieſus Chriſte, as wee haue declared here before in order at large.
            Now this remedy is applyed by a double effect and working of the holy Ghoſt. For firſt the holy Ghoſt diſpoſeth our intellygence, to the vnderſtandyng of the doctrine of the Goſpell, which otherwyſe ſéemeth to the worlde verye foolyſhneſſe,

and ſo incontinently after it maketh our ſpirite beléeue that this doctrine of ſaluation freely in Ieſus Chriſte, is not onelye true (for the Diuels know alſo that this doctrine is moſt true, and yet therfore be not ſaued) but alſo that it appertayneth to vs: and thys is it that is called fayth, the which is ſo highly commended in the ſcripture, which is to be vnderſtand whē any man doth perſwade himſelf certaynly, that ſaluation & eternall lyfe doth properly and partycularly appertaine to him ſelfe, becauſe Ieſus Chriſte is declared to vs in his word vnder thys condition, that we doo taſte of him, and apply him to our ſelues by fayth. It followeth then, that fayth is the only inſtrumēt, by the which as by ones hand ſaluation may be felt and taken in Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore S. Paule ſayd, that we be iuſtyfied by fayth onely, and alſo do lyue by it only: not that fayth is our righteouſnes and life, but becauſe that by onely fayth we embrace Ieſus Chriſt, and be certayne that he is our ryghteouſneſſe and lyfe. For when any man beléeueth that hee is appoynted and

ordained to ſaluation and eternal lyfe in Ieſus Chriſt, incontinent he is made partaker of all the benefites of Ieſus Chriſt to eternall lyfe: for Ieſus Chryſt is offered to vs vpon this condition.
            The thyrd effect and worke of the holy ghoſt is fixed and ſet on our harts on this maner, that as he doth vnite and knyt vs into Ieſus Chriſt, as is ſayde before, and that Ieſus Chriſt can not be ydle within vs, it is neceſſary that the ſame holy goſt which engendreth fayth in vs (as is ſayd) do ſanctifie our hartes, that is to ſay, doo conſecrate vs to God. Now this ſanctyfication hath two partes, that is to ſaye, the aboliſhing of this corrupt nature and qualytie, which before cauſed the lawe of God to dyſpleaſe vs, and the creation of the new nature or qualytie maketh vs to beginne to wyll and to do cheerefully and couragiouſlye thoſe thynges whiche wee know do pleaſe God.
            Nowe this abolyſhing is firſt begun in the vnderſtāding, by the which the darknes is lightened in ſuch wiſe, that we begyn to know and approue that which we

dyd thinke before was foolyſhneſſe. Then after in the wyll which is conſecrated to God in ſuch wyſe that it hateth ſinne, not for the payne, but for the loue of God, and loueth ryghteouſneſſe, not becauſe of rewarde, but becauſe that righteouſneſſe of it ſelfe pleaſeth God, ſo that if there were not yet death appointed and prepared for ſinners, or eternal life appointed and prepared for thoſe which ſtudy to do ryghteouſnes: yet had hée rather for the loue of God to folow righteouſnes, that is to ſay, to ſerue God holyly, & to loue his neyghbour as his lawe commaundeth, and to endure and ſuffer all maner of paine for his names ſake, then to ſerue the Diuell and his couetouſnes.
            Wherefore to the ende that I may gather all ſumarily together, howe onely in Ieſus Chriſt we find all that is neceſſary to ſaluation, lykewyſe onely by the holy Ghoſt we aply Ieſus Chriſt to our ſelues by fayth. But becauſe this fayth in the beginning is very ſmall in vs, it is neceſſary that it be increaſed in vs dayly: wherefore now we muſt declare by what entertainment

or meanes it is nooryſhed for to encreaſe more and more in vs. Fyrſt, as it is created in vs by the holy Ghoſt thorowe the meanes of the woorde of God▪ which is ſowen in our harts, and for that cauſe is compared to ſéede: So lykewyſe it is nooriſhed and encreaſed by the ſame word, when wée heare it dilligentlye and truly preached in the Church of God, and alſo when we reade it in our houſes, and thinke vpon it diligently, & meditate in it day and nyght, forſaking all humane and worldly affections which mought turne vs from God, and holde vs in worldlyneſſe. Therfore Dauid ſayd he was happy, who? not the ritch, not Kings, or princes, or Marchauntes, or any other Cittizens of this worlde, but he, that thynketh continually and meditateth diligently in the doctrine of God. Therefore they be called ſtraungers in this worlde, wandring and marching toward the celeſtiall countrey.
            Secondly, we muſt knowe, that God aydeth and helpeth oure debylyte and weakeneſſe in ſuch ſorte, that not being

content to declare vnto vs by his woorde with what loue he loueth vs in his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, but would alſo ioyne to his word certain outward marks or ſygnes, to the which alſo he added certayne ceremonies or maner of doings, repreſenting (by a certayne manner) to our eyes, and geuing into our handes his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt with all his goodnes and vertues, of the which we haue before ſpoken, to the ende that our faith being ayded & ſupported by theſe helpes, ſhoulde bée more and more confyrmed in vs, to drawe vs nerer to Ieſus Chriſt. Now theſe marks be called in Gréeke myſteries, that is to ſaye, ſecreetes, becauſe that God doth ſignifie and repreſent to vs by them thinges whiche be verye ſecreete in déede, becauſe man ſhoulde neuer doubt in them, that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt with all his vertues and goodnes vnto eternall life. But in latine they be called Sacramentes, becauſe of an other manner of vſe of them, of the which we ſhall ſpeake hereafter.
            Now there is in the Church of Chriſte but only two ſacraments, that is to ſaye,

Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper: becauſe that after the aboliſhinge of the Ceremonies of the law, and that the ſonne of rightouſnes is ſproong vp, God woulde not againe wrap vs in a multitude of figures and ſhadowes, but onelye hath ordayned two Sacramentes, and wylled that they ſhould be compoſed & made of moſt ſimple things, that is of water, bread and wine, and that they ſhoulde be celebrated with moſt ſymple Ceremonies, that is with ſprinkling of water, in eating of bread, & drinking of Wine, leaſt that man which of nature is ſore geuen to ſuperſtition, ſhoulde abuſe theſe thinges. For if they ſhould ſee any great preparation or ſome gorgeous or exquiſyte Ceremonies, they woulde ſtaye and be vtterly occupyed in theſe external pomps. And in ſtéede wher they ſhoulde by theſe markes aſcende vpward into heauen by faith, and there embrace the thinges which to vs are ſignyfied by theſe markes and tokens, yet contrariwiſe forgetting heauen, would ſtay altogether in theſe outward markes, and there woulde ſearch his ſaluation. Therfore

thoſe dyd wholy & altogether corrupt the vſe of the Sacraments, the which not content with the ſimple and bare inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſte, haue burdened and charged the Churche with infinite Ceremonies, ſo that of a Chriſtianitye, they haue made not onely a Iewery, but alſo a Paganrye.
            The Sacraments be ordayned of God for the ſame and & purpoſe that the woord lyuelye declared is, without Sacrament, that is to ſaye, to be meanes to vs to ſerue and ayde vs more and more to vnite and ioyne vs to Ieſus Chriſte by fayth, the which cannot be wythout the word. For the word declareth to vs, that which God doth repreſent and ratifie by them, for as much as they be diſible ſignes of the ſpirituall coniunction whiche we haue with Ieſus Chriſte. Nowe there is 4. pryncipall poyntes to conſider in thys matter: the fyrſt what the ſignes bee, the ſeconde what is the thyng ſignifyed and ratifyed by them, the thyrde what is the coniunction of the ſignes and the thing ſignified, the fowrth howe we may communycate

with the ſignes and the thinges ſignified. The ſignes bée as well thinges néedefull to ſerue vs in the Sacramentes (whiche be water in Baptiſme, bread and wine in the Supper): as be the Ceremonies and manners of doings or ordinances by the woorde of God in the vſe of them, as we ſhall ſaye hereafter.
            The thing ſignified is Ieſus Chriſte with all his goodneſſe, by the which we be united together with him to haue eternal lyfe.
            The ſignes be not tranſported or tranſubſtantiated into the thing ſignified, but bee conioyned with the ſame, not by pronounciation of certayne woordes, but by the ordynance of Ieſus Chriſte, author of the Sacramentes: and not by a corporall manner, or naturall, but onely ſo as God offereth alwayes ſpyritually, that which is ſignified by the corporall ſignes.
            The meanes to communicate with the ſignes is viſible & naturall, but the thing ſignified, that is Ieſus Chriſte with all his goodneſſe, is receyued ſpyrituallye by fayth onelye, as is ſayde before. Then

it followeth, thoſe that be not in the faith receyue but the bare ſignes, but be neuer theleſſe culpable, as well for that they receyue but the bare ſigne vnworthely, as alſo for that they haue no reſpect nor regarde to the thing which was offered to them, and ſignifyed, that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſte with all hys goodneſſe, the whiche they haue reiected by their wyckedneſſe.
            The ſigne of Baptiſme is water, with the whiche wée bée wete according to the ordynance of God, in the name of the father, of the ſonne, and of the holy Ghoſt. The water repreſenteth to vs the bloud of Ieſus Chriſte, which was ſhed for the remyſſion of ſynnes (as the viſible water is ſhedde vpon our bodyes) the which ſanctifieth vs to lyue righteouſly, as was ſayde before.
            And foraſmuch as the Sacramentes ought to procéede after the word, becauſe that the thing for the which they wer ordained to ſignify and zeale into our harts canot be receyued but by fayth, & fayth is geuen to vs thorow the preachyng of the woorde: Yet neuertheles concernyng the

yong chyldren of the faythful, we do communycate and receyue them into Baptiſme, although as yet they be not capable to heare the doctrine, or to make confeſſion as they ought to doo, if they were come to age, yet neuertheſſe they be compriſed in the couenant with their fathers, for the which by conſequent the marke or ſigne may not, nor ought not to be denied them.
            The ſecond vſe of Baptiſme is to ioyne vs together to lyue all with one accorde, without changing, putting too, or diminiſhing the marke or badge we all heare.
            In the holy Supper of the Lorde, celebrated according to his holy ordinaunce, without changing, or putting too, or diminiſhing, the bread is a Sacrament to vs, that is to ſay, a ſeale and marke of y• very body of Ieſus Chriſte, which aſcended vp to the ryght hand of God his father, after his death & reſurrection. The wyne lykewyſe to vs is the Sacrament of the very blood of him which ſhedde it for vs. The breaking of the bread to vs, repreſenteth the precious body of Ieſus Chriſte to bée

broken with the ſorrowes and paynes of death: the powring forth of the wine, the ſhedding of his precious bloud: the Myniſter geuing vs bread & wyne, repreſenteth Ieſus Chriſt geuing him ſelfe to vs. In that we take, eate, & drinke the breade and wine, teſtifieth to vs, and ſealeth into our hartes, the vnity and knot of our bodyes with Ieſus Chriſte, to poſſeſſe hym more & more with all his goodnes to eternall lyfe. Not with téeth or mouth, but with true & liuely fayth, which lyfteth vs vp into heauen, ſpyritually to embrace hym (and yet neuertheleſſe moſt truely) whiche is our noriſhment to euerlaſting blyſſe, as the bread and wyne corporallye and viſibly receyued, doth entertayn and nooryſh vs in this corporall lyfe. For we doubt not but God wyll accomplyſhe and fulfyll that whiche hee promyſeth by hys woorde, and offereth by his Sacramentes to all beléeuers.
            The ſecond vſe of the holy ſupper is to vnite vs together as members of one body, lyke as we do eate of one bread, made of many graines of wheate, and drynk of

one Wyne, made of many grapes, to bee partakers with Ieſus Chriſt.
            And as wée muſt eate daylye to entertaine and preſerue vs in this lyfe, ſo likewyſe it is requiſite to come to this ſpyrituall Table, as often as is poſſyble, the which cannot be in Baptiſme. For it is ſufficient to be once entred into y• church neuer to depart. Lykewiſe, foraſmuch as it is requyred that euery man proue and examine himſelfe, to wete, publikely and openly to auowe and declare the death of the Lord with thankeſgeuing, in the holy Communion. Alſo it appeareth that it appertayneth not to thoſe that bée not meete to receiue it, to wete litle children, whiche neuertheleſſe be ſaued, foraſmuch as they be compriſed in the couenaunt of ſaluation with theyr fathers: neyther appertayneth it to thoſe whiche bée not inſtructed, or do not vnderſtande the law of God, or haue not ſo much profited as to make profeſſion of theyr fayth: nor lykewyſe to thoſe which be declared excōmunicated, that is to ſay, throwen out of the communion and company of the faithful,

by the lawful iudgement of the Church.
            Beholde in ſumme what is the doctrine of our ſaluation thorow Ieſus Chriſt only, by the meanes of our faith. And whoſoeuer receyueth this doctrine (the which cannot be, but wher it is faithfully preached, & the Sacraments truly miniſtred, according to the order eſtablyſhed by the worde of God) is a member of the church of Ieſus Chriſt, which is called catholik, that is to ſaye vniuerſall, and out of that Church is no ſaluation. Moreouer, all congregatiōs and aſſembles whatſoeuer they bee which hath not thoſe markes, although they call them ſelues the Churche of Ieſus Chriſt a thouſande times, what ſoeuer place or ſucceſſion they alledge or ſhew forth, can be no other but the▪ Sinagoge of Satan, wherin there is but damnation. And therfore it is good & néedefull for all men to ſeparate them ſelues, and depart from them according as S. Peter ſayde, ſaue your ſelues from this peruers generation, ſpeaking of Aarons ſucceſſors, and of the Church of Ieruſalem.
