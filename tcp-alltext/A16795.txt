               TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Thomas Baron of Buckhurst Knight of the Honorable Order of the Garter, L. High Treasurer of England, one of the LL of his Maiesties most Honorable Privy Councell, and Chauncellour of the Vniversitie of Oxford, my very especiall good Lord.
            
               RIGHT Honorable, it is not vnknowne vnto your Lordship that in the dayes of our late most blessed Soveraigne of famous memory, some vnnaturall Englishe, who as Fugitives had departed their Countrey, did maliciously and slaunderously write against our stare Ecclesiasticall and Civil, and oftentimes against those who governed both the one & the other.

And albeit the pretence whereof they did make shew to the world, was only the restoring of the Romane Religion, yet men of deeper iudgmēt could not be ignorant, that they had a purpose to prepare their credulous Scholers for a day of alteration otherwise; and in the meane while to make them discontented with the present times, which they ceased not to lade with al calumniations, and wicked imputations whatsoever. Amongst this number was and is a certaine audacious person, vvho termeth himselfe Doctour Hill: and being a man of no more then a competent learning, but yet of a very bolde spirit, hath traced the steps of other his felowes which went before him. For he principally maketh shew to yeelde Reasons, why Popery should be the true faith of Christ, and for that purpose heapeth vp a many of weake and worne-out Arguments: but toward the middle of his booke falleth into other points, as if this Kingdome our Countrey, were a sinke of wickednesse beyond all the nations of the earth, and therefore detestable to God and good men. In respect of which vnsufferable defamations, it was helde most fit that this Treatise should receive an Aunswere: but especially for the pointes of Papistrie broched and vrged

therein, which may beguile the harts of the simple, or such who are not indifferently affected. Having therefore at the intreaty of others vvho wishe the flourishing of true godlinesse, traveiled some-vvhat in this Argument, for the better setling of such as will take paines to reade or heare, it now remaineth that I should recōmend the protection therof, to your Honorable Lordship, to whō of right & duty it appertaineth. For as heere-tofore, so alwaies I must acknowledge, that whatsoever my poore labours can effect, is due vnto your Lordship as to a special maintainer of true Religiō, a lover of our Coūtry, a Protectour of our Vniversity, an vp-holder of learning, & vnto me a most Honorable Patrone.
            Almighty God evermore blesse and encrease your Honour, to the good of his Church, to the service of the Kings most gracious Maiestie, & to the great benefite of this Common-wealth. From Vniversity College in Oxford. Ianuar. 4. 1604.

               AS he is not to be commended for skill at his weapon, who frameth vnto himselfe a man of straw, and then at his pleasure doth pricke or strike him: so you are not in too high a degree to be thought well of, for your knowledge in Divinity, who in the entrance of your petty worke, do forge vnto your selfe an Epistle put out in the name of other, where-vnto you may say, or not say, what best fitteth your owne humour. You, who can be Fitz-Williams in steede of Hill, are capeable of such a quality; & in composing of your former letter you cannot much dissemble it; when you pretende, your friends, the two Citizens that write vnto you, to be first so learned, as out of Bud. ex Cicer. 
               Budaeus, or Tully to call you Opinator vehemens, and secondly so zealous as to seeke to reclaime you from your course: and yet you bring them in, making no mention of Christian perswasion drawn from Divinity, or the word of God; but only multiplying vpō you worldly reasons of Countrey and Parents, and friends, & preferment, and other such like matters. Such of our people as are grounded in Religion, can readily yeeld some account 1. Pet. 3. 15 
               of the hope that is in them: but such as withall do make show of learning, may be presumed in a matter of this nature would intersert somwhat, which might savour of spirituall contemplation, especially their letter being sent to one of that minde, wherof throughout this treatise you shew your selfe to be. But this devise of your owne seemed vnto you the most cleanly shifte, that by such a Fighting with a shaddow.

wee woulde gladly knowe, howe true amity should be in any, and not amor amicitia. You had neede explane this Paradoxe.
            If you were borne and baptised in Popery, it may seeme that your birth was in Q. Maries daies: but how you should receiue confirmation in the same errors, vnlesse it were after your flying beyond the seas, we cannot tell. It is one thing to be generated, another to be regenerated; one thing to haue a birth, another a new birth. And as touching your Baptisme, you should remember that you were baptised into the faith of Christ, not into the beleefe of the Bishop of Rome; who for his owne part shall stand or fall to God, but shall not so answere as to cleere the soules of other. Epiphanius in Ancorato. 
               Origen shall not stand by vs in the day of iudgement; neither shall any other so assist vs, as by his protection to savegard vs. Neither is it sufficient to say, that after this or this sort I was baptised, and therefore I will continue in the same; in as much as the Iewe may say so farre, touching his Circūcision in Iudaisme, and the Mahumetane concerning his Circumcision in Mahumetisme: yea the Arrians were baptised in Arrianisme, and other Heretikes receaved that Sacrament after the obliquities of their Heresies. It is ill to begin amisse: but it is worse to persevere in the by-waies of vncertaine errour. Tullie could recount it for a faulte, that Academicar. Qu

               men in the weakest time of their age, either listning to some friend, or being inveigled by one oration of some body which they have first heard, they iudge of thinges vvhich they knovve not, and looke vnto whatsoever discipline they bee caried as vvith a tempest. vnto it they doe cleave as to a rocke, and never examine vvhether it be right or vvronge. Yet such as these, in their elder yeeres might have saide for themselves; In this have vvee beene conversant even from our youth: therein have vvee had our education; and therefore novve vvee are not to varie from it: This determination had not beene good in Philosophie, neither is the like to it commendable in Divinitie.
            Your magnisike bravado of embracing that which is so auncient and vniversall, is but a blaze to dazle the eies of your credulous disciples. If in defence of your superstition, you bee able to shevve ought of more antiquitie, then the vvord

of God is, we will soone yeelde vnto you: but verily in comparison hereof, all for which you striue is but plaine novelty. Neither doth the wide spreading of errour, alter the nature of it into truth, or giue any priviledge for the warrant of the same: for then should the service and obedience of Sathan bee of higher worth then the verity of Christ, in as much as the feare of God hath ever beene contained within more narrow listes, then the devotions and ceremonies performed to the Devill. Truth is not to be esteemed by the multitude of the followers, but by the reality of it selfe. But in the processe of this worke, there will be occasion more then once to speake of this argument. That ioy of yours, that you follow not any new opinions, as of Puritanisme, Brownisme, Martinisme, or of the familie of loue, is but slenderly supported: for among men of vnderstanding, it is no better to holde a long continued vntruth, then a late-sprung-vp falshood. The one is to defende an inveterate errour, and the other to mainetaine a later mis-conceite. And probably against the former it may be obiected, that as A

In those matters which deflect from the rule of right, the heavier sentence doth ever light, according to the measure or quantity of of the variation from the rule, not according to the age or youth of the opinion. That is but a circumstance: the other is the maine consideration.
            Great carefulnesse you pretende to satisfie your friendes, that it is not on any heady or braine-sicke fantasticalitie, that you are so addicted to the Romish profession: But while you ioine there-vnto, that you haue no purpose to perswade other to your superstition, as beeing daungerous because prohibited by the lawes of the lande vvherein vvee live, vvee dare not entertaine that on your Popish credit.

And in respect of this your proiect, we marveile not at all at your braving and facing, that you are able to afford vs infinite moe Reasons, vvhy your profession is true Religion. VVe are now well acquainted vvith such bragges as these are, and our youngest Divines who looke into your workes, which come from beyonde the seas, doe despise it and contemne it in you al; that vvhen you haue spent many yeares in compiling your pamphlets or greater bookes, yet it must be said to be done in a few weekes or monthes, or as Campians Reasons were, Conclusio decem Rationum. 
               munusculum contextam operis in itinere subcisivis. And when you haue raked togither all that you can say, yea & stolne it also from the works one of another, yet you coulde make large volumes more, and fill the vvorld vvith the ever-flowing streames of your continuall running rivers. Of this wee shall neede no better instance thē your selfe; whose huge boasts wil be displayed, to be but base and poore shiftes; and your Quartron will be manifested to be, for a great parte thereof, but borrowed stuffe, and that of such meane qualitie, as that hardly it may goe in the number of the buttons and lace, vvhereof you talke: that is to say, for Pedlerie and paultry ware it may bee reputed, and not as ought of any precious accounte or reckoning. You had neede therefore intreate your friendes (as you doe) to take all vvell, which if they doe vpon this your request, and so yeelde you your defire, it is much more of their kindenesse and curtesie, then of your deserving.
            The protestation, which you make of loyal and duetiful affection toward our and your Soveraigne, is in shewe somewhat, if in truth your hearte and actions doe directly and indirectlye corresponde there-vnto. But it may be demurred vpon, whither those who are in highest authority, and by long experience and manifolde intelligence haue vnderstoode their course who are brought vp in the Seminaries, will giue credite to your wordes.

You doe not so daunce in a net, as that you can see every body, and no body can see you. There is much and very much preiudice against you, such as wil not in hast, vpon the naked word of a person suspect, be satisfied for. We know this your Maxime, that faith given, or promise made to an Hereuke may be broken. We know, that with you the Pope is Christes Vicar, and his voice is to be obeyed as an immediate Oracle of God. We vndoubtedly vnderstande that diverse of the Romane Bishops haue done their worst to depriue her late sacred Maiesty of her crowne and dignity. We finde that many of your Predecessors and Schoole-maisters, haue in printed books much reviled and railed against the Lords Annointed, and some doe yet persist. We are assured that the companies of your fellow students, are mainetained by the late professed enemies of our Religion, Prince, and Countrey. We haue it confessed by men of their owne sort, that many of the English beyonde the seas are at the sole devotion of the Spanyard. It cannot be denied that the Rectours and chiefe men of, or neere your Seminaries, as Allen, Bristow, Stapleton, Parsons, & other, haue either by their actiōs, or their writings, or both, declared themselues known traitours against our dead Soveraigne & the State, as also that diverse of the leaders did with their best indevours helpe forward the invasion, Anno 1588, and some of the meaner sort came in the fleete. And as certaine it is, that sundry both Irish and English Priests and Iesuites haue beene principall instigatours of the Irish tumults. At home, albeit of late there hath appeared some difference between such as are vnited to the Arch-Priest, and the rest which oppugne him, yet in this our Q. Elizabeth did certainely finde that they al agreed, that to their vitermost they did knit The proclamation. Nov. 5. 1602 as many as they could fast to the Pope, diminishing the number of those who were assured to her Highnesse, and encreasing his account, who heretofore had as a temporall Prince his banner displaide in the field, and stil to her death continued his warlike Stratagems against her Maiesty. And from this roote of being reconciled to the Romane Bishop, it ariseth, that many of your followers are male-contented with the present state, and insinuate so farre as they dare, that they wish another governement. Al these scruples make against you;

besides the frequent conspiracies by some against the life of our late gracious Queene, and by others, the iustification of such Rebels as haue lift vp their sword against her. And well it were, if together with her death, the wicked malice of that false generation had dyed: but it is otherwise, as by the attempts of that Quodlibeting Watson and other his complices, is evident to all men. They haue by printed books, made infinite protestations of alleageance and loyalty, the least sparke whereof doth novv see me never to haue resided within their breasts: which well demonstrateth what credit may be given to actiue stirring Papists. Now for your part if you approue these thinges, your heart is not sounde: and if you dislike them, you renounce many Theoremes, and much also of the practise of Popery: and then you may be a witnesse to your selfe, that as many of your forerunners and fellowes haue swarved in these actions and positions, so they and you also may goe astray in your other pointes of Papistrie, vvhich you at this time doe not more eagerly defende, or confidently mainetaine, then your predecessours and copartners haue done the rest before named. But vntill this doe enter into your hearte, and you by evident demonstration do shewe vs some better fruit, you must giue vs leaue with a watchfull eie to obserue you, and to holde you no more loayll, then wee haue good assuraunce thereof. An enemye canne humble himselfe, and make faire vveather, till hee can gaine opportunitye to effecte his longe-vvished and principall desires.

                  THat some doe still continue to plead for their vnholy father of Rome, & do their best endevours to vnderprop & vphold the ruines of his decaying Babylon, ought not to seeme strange to any Christian man, who hath but a competent knowledge of things spiritual. For while there is a church militant, there shal also be a Church malignant, laboring to oppresse and keepe downe the other; and so long as Antichrist standeth, he shall haue his admirers, yea and Apoc. 13. 15. adorers too, of the image of the beast.

               2 But of the two, it is more to be marveiled at, that after so long and plentifull a flowing forth of the water of life, there should yet be anie of our countri-men and women remaining at home, who will tast of puddle water, yea bee as greedie to drinke thereof, as the maisters of the broken cisternes can bee ready to propose it vnto them. That come there forth any pamphlet, of what small worth soever, yet some or other will either for their ignorance admire it, or for their vnsetlednes entertaine it, or for their perversenes embrace it, as if it were some divine Oracle descended from aboue. But this is the instabilitie of their iudgment, who are once Gal. 3. 1. bewitched like the foolish Galathians, that although Christ hath beene so lively testified vnto them, as if hee had beene crucified before their eies, yet if newe teachers come one after another, they will earnestly attend, & listen vnto thē.

                  the bread of Angels, & long to be againe in Aegypt. If there were never philosopher so absurde to invent any fond opinion, but there were some auditours as absurde to maintaine and follow the same, who can conceive but that vntill the destructiō of that whore, the famous strumpet (with the Apoc. 17. 2 cup of whose fornication many of the Kings, and much of the people of the earth have bin dronken) shoulde stil have some inamored on her. As there ever will be deceivers, so there shall be some which will be deceived. Satan cannot give over his Iob. 2. 2. compassing the earth: his skoutes & messengers vvill entend his service. Some children of Idolaters to the worlds end, shall vnto the Exo. 20. 5. third and fourth generation participate of their parents curse, God with-drawing his grace from them, and not opening their eies: the peevish will decline, stumbling at some rocke of offence: weake women to shew themselves to be Eves daughters, will rather Gen. 3. 1. chuse to harken vnto the serpent then to God almighty: & young ones for want of iudgment and discretion, wil credulously listen to a Sirens Song. Thus it hath bin, and thus it wil be. Not withstanding, the Magistrate by his charge, & the Minister by his duty, & indeede every Christian in his place,

               3 Yet this being graunted, that such leaders and such followers there be and will be, it may neverthelesse be much marveiled at, that the wisedome of Poperie is so blinded, and the ability of English fugitives is growne to so low an ebbe in the Seminaries, that to make good their party they haue no better means to vse, but such base ones, as in this booke or libel are presented to the world. Especiallie since this treatise is pretended to come from a Doctor of Divinitie, and one taking degree in one of those Vniversities, which by themselves bee See Reason 15. and Bristow Motive 31. reported to bee so famous, as that almost he who may but smell the smoake of them, or breath but a while on the ayre there, shal be inspired with knowledge, & have more learning Metaphysically infused into him, thē among vs is to bee attained to in many yeares.

That which comming vnawares, seemed to the improvident at the first to be some clap of thunder, was at the last discerned not to be so much as the striking vp of a drumme: It was no otherwise but a fewe stones shaken togither in an empty barrell. Yet the wile of the man is to be commended, that he could set som good words on it, as the Montibank

               4 But this gallant with whom I haue to deale, and who speaketh as hereafter you shall heare, imagining that all the men in England are as blind as he would have them to be, hath sent vs a fresh garment made of other mens olde clothes, which the most of vnderstanding have seene and knowne, to bee both worne bare and torne like the Ruines of Time. And hee hath little altered the verie fashion of it, saving peradventure to sette the right sleeve where the left formerly was, and something now before, which erst stood behinde. Indeed some peeces he hath shrunk, & drawne thē in narrower, to make them seeme the thicker: & some other few (for in sooth they are but few) he hath enlarged with a skirt or hem of new cloath: and yet willing to buy as little stuffe as possibly he might, in some places he hath sewed two or three ragges togither, so to make a pretty peece. The truth is, that now almost An. 1574. thirty yeeres since, a coūtry-man of ours, whom D. Fulke not vnfitly called Bl
                        •…
                     ring Bristow, did with much bouldnesse and little learning put forth a booke, which he called his Motives vnto the Catholike saith. VVhich as then for satisfying of the simple, & repressing of the craking insolency of the adversary, it was answered by a worthy man D. Fulkes Retentives. who now resleth with the Lord; yet since that time, (howsoever by some Romanists, Banke-rupts of better matter, it hath ever now & then slightly beene talked of) almost generally it hath lien contemned of all, scant worthy the naming or serious recounting. Yet of late because Master Parsons was busie about State-causes, or the supporting of his weake and languishing Arch-priest, and they have not manie other which may keep the mint going, in the yeare 1599. some body thought good to revise their olde t

                  inkets, and for lacke of richer stuffe, out were put these Motives againe, printed at Antwerpe, as in the first Page is prefixed. And albeit this were a Crambê, whereof most stomakes, which received it, had surfeted before; yet this honest friend D. Hill, thought he would not leave it so, but the

verie next yeare 1600. after, and from the same forged place, & printed with the same letters, for any difference that may bee seene betweene them, sendeth this script vnto vs, as if it were some new excellent booke, wheras indeede much of the forme & manner, and almost all the matter, for the ground thereof, is taken out of Bristow.
               
               5 Yet of his olde Rectour Mr. Parsons, hee borroweth some fevve Memorandums, and heere and there a touch from Campian, and a finger he hath in Staphilus translated by Stapleton, on al which he bestoweth ever now and then a little viperous aspersion of his own; if among so much taken vpon trust, we may iudge that to be his owne, which perhaps might bee found to belong to some other, if we had vse of all their bookes & dictates which they retaine among them. Had it not bin better for one of that learning which this title doth entend, to have translated a peece of Bellarmine, or Gregory de Ualencia out of Latine into English? If the worke had bin but meane, yet this had bin gained by the bargaine, that every English Papist & Protestant almost, had not bin acquainted with the matter before hand. But to take an olde English booke, and to make a new English booke of it, is but to take an olde garment, and to turne it and newe dresse it, where when all is done, because it is not onely turned but rotten stuffe also, it deserveth no better then to be turned out of dore, that it may finde no place in the conscience of any Christian man or woman. Where by the way it may be observed, that reasons for Popery grow fewer & fewer; for Mr. Bristow being of likely hood desirous to have made them vp fiftie, did stretch his witte so farre, as that, tales quales, he brought th

                   to eight and forty. But D. Hill hath reduced his number to five & twenty: And though he would have his friēds beleeve, In his second letter that he can adde many more, yet the Reader shall finde that in these he hath involved almost all the remainder of Mr. Bristowes matter, as in the processe hereof shall be declared. And if heereafter he bring more, by Gods assistāce he shal have thē examined. In the meane while I will be dealing with these, whō after the French fashion he vttereth by the Quartron; and calling them A Quartron of Reasons, doth intimate vnto vs, that being wayed in the ballance of the Sanctuary

they are as much worth as a quarterne of raysings. Let vs see now what proofe is made of his first stout proposition.

Thus he did fore-tell by diver se & sundry Prophets, as by Esay, who saide the Church should be as a mountaine, to the which All nations should slowe. And manie people shall goe and say; Come and let vs ascend to the Cap. 2. mountaine of our Lord: and after, Idols shall vtterly bee bruised, and to be briefe, all this Chapter, yea all the rest in a manner fore-shevv the same matter, declaring most plainely the conversion of all Nations to the Church of the Messias, and

Heerevpon it was that good men thirsted and longed so greatly for the comming of the Messias, knovving that by him all people which sate in darkenes, and in the shadow of death, should be lightened, delivered, and set in the right way to Heaven.

               G. ABBOT.
               6 I will not dispute with you, whether the maister Devil (whom the Iewes termed Luc. 11. 15. 
                  Beelzebub) bee called Lucifer or no, and whence that opinion had both his beginning and progresse: neither will I handle any other thing of like nature, which properly belongeth not to that which is in difference betweene you and mee: But I will condescend vnto you, that some Iob, or Iethro or some fewe such excepted, the Church for the ordinarie compasse of it, vvas after the entrance into Canaan, vvithin the boundes of Israel, that is, the twelve Tribes at the first, and afterward in Iewry, accounting that to comprehend the men of Iuda and Beniamin, with the Levites. And on these tearmes it stood till the comming of our most blessed Saviour, concerning whose appearance Esay did foretell, that to Cap. 2. 2. 
                  the mountaine of the house of the Lord &c. all nations should flowe, And many people should goe and say, Come and let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lorde. But that which you cite of Idols, Vers. 18. 
                  And the Idols will he vtterly destroy, howsoever it may be applied vnto Christ, yet if you looke againe, it may well be disputed to belong in that Chapter to another time and matter; and then you in referring the whole, to the revealing of the Messias, may very well be deceived. I will not stand vvith you, but that Esay and Daniel, and David and the other sacred writers, do give ample testimony of a copious confluence every way to the Church. As also it must be yeelded that men longed for the comming of the fore-appointed Saviour, since hee it vvas alone who should bring ioy vnto mākind. Only by the way I do tell you, that in delivering the words of Esay, you are bould with the text, when you put it, Our Lord, whereas no such word, as Our, is there to be foūd. But that is your custome to hale in that word throughout the whole newe Testament, it neither being in the

Greeke nor in the vulgar Latine. Onely the 
                     〈◊〉
                   Rhemists doe enioyne In 1. Tim. 6. 20. it to their obedient children, that they must not say, The Lord, but Our Lord, as we say, Our Lady, for his mother, not the Lady, & this they make to be a marke of difference betweene themselves so speaking, and vs saying after the Scripture, The Lord. And accordingly our English people doe practise it, if they savour of Popery
                     •…
                   so much that in all my life I have scant heard any in cōmon speech alwaies saying, Our Lord, but that party hath more or lesse beene tainted that way.
               7 Furthermore when you name Heathenish Idolatrie, doe you give it that Epitheton, as meaning that Christ would put an end to the horrible superstitions of the Ethnicks, but that there should stil be Idolatry in your Synagogue, which by no meanes you wil forgoe? Or is it rather your minde, that all Idolatrie is heathenish, and that there can bee none in the daies of the newe Testament? Indeede so Mr. Bristow your good maister, woulde make vs beleeve, saying, Motiv. 32. 
                  So must wee everie vvhere vnderstand Idols in the olde Testament, that they were figures of Heresyes in this time of the nevve Testament, no other Idols being now but Heresies. Ponitur Idolum quan

                      do novum dogma constituitur &c. An Idoll is sell vp, when a newe Position (or Heresy) is erected, saith Saint Hierome, the most learned & expert 
                  In Ier. 32. 
                  interpreter of the Scriptures. Saint Paule also himselfe giving his voice thervnto, where by Baal, the Idoll that God did speake of to Elias, 
                  Rom. 11. 
                  be teacheth vs to vnderstād the erroneous wicked doctrin against Christ, 
                  3. Reg 19. 
                  of his incredulous Countrie-men the Iewes of his time. This is good Logicke Mr. Bristow, and for the sweetnes of the conclusion, fit to be studied in your Popish Vniversities. An Idoll is set vp when a new doctrine is erected, (which is a figurative vnderstanding) & Baal may in some application signisie an erroneous doctrine, Ergo there bee now no other Idols but Heresies, neither have bin vnder the Gospell. By this reckoning you doe well in your Catechismes to leave out the second commandement, as not at al belonging to the newe Testament. But why did Saint Iohn, after Christs death and ascension too, bidde, 1. Ioh 5. 21 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  Babes keepe your selves from Idolls. And is it not saide else where speaking of times, after the opening of the Apoc. 8. 1. seventh seale, and when the sixt Cap 9. 13. Angell had sounded his trumpet, that is to say, towards the end of the

world, that men Cap 9. 20.

                  repented not of the deedes of their handes, that they should not worship Devils, and Idols of gold and silver, and brasse & stone, and of wood, which neither can see, neither heare, neither goe, which being taken with al the circumstāces, is a most manifest convictiō, that in the later daies there should be materiall Idols. To which may be added the Idols destroied by Cōstantine, three hundred yeares after Christ, & the intolerable Idolatry which in this last age hath beene discovered to be committed, in the East Indies, America and many parts of Africa, by diverse Ethnicks and Infidels, which did & do inhabit there. Therefore you cannot so run away & escape, but that evē now also Idolaters you may be. This I note to shew how your Popery doth hang vpon gimols.

                  NOw if the Religion of the Papists (as these new men tearme them) be false & arronious, then is it against the Messias, and consequently it is a Religion of the Devils owne invention, and hee the maister and inspirer thereof, and so by it he is served and worshipped: and then must it needes follow that the Prophets were false, yea Christ himselfe saide not truely, in telling his Disciples, that the Prince of this world, that is, the Divell, should then be cast out, and that he would draw all to himselfe, for that since his passion the Divell bath had a more large and ample dominion then he had before.

               8 Very bluntly & boisterously is your second Propositiō here connected to your former: where we wil not be straightlaced toward you, but readily yeelde you the tearme of Papists. For if Christians be such as depend vpon Christ, you may wel be called Papists, as resting your summn̄ bonū
                   vpō the Popes pleasure & determination. Neither shall you neede much to presse vs, to grant that your Religion, or rather Superstitiō is false & erronious, yea against the Messias, & as far forth as the abuses of it stretch, of the Divels owne invention. For Saint Paule doth teach vs, that it is 1. Tim. 4. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 2. 3. 
                  doctrine of Divels, to speake false in hypocrisie, to forbid to marrie,
                  
                  to abstaine from meates, vvhich God hath created to bee receaved vvith giving of thankes; the first wherof, most of you plētifully performe, the second you inhibit to some men at all times, the third to all men at some times, and that not for state-governmēt, but for Religion sake. But the sequel of your inference, doth prove to be a most discinct and dissolute thing: for howe will it then followe that the Prophets were false, and Christ saide not truely? Marry, in telling his Disciples that the Prince of the worlde, that is, the Devill should then bee cast out, and that he would drawe all to himselfe. Which doe you so expound, as that all Nations of the world should immediately after his death, resurrection, and ascension be converted to the faith, & should alwaies so cōtinue? which your former words may wel seeme to import, by your inculcating of Al 
                  Fol. 2. 
                  Nations, & having afterwards subioyned vnto it, ever continue without interruption, &, Fol. 3. 
                  all Kinges & people should acknowledge this Church, & againe, all people which sate in darkenes, & in the shadow of death, should be lightened, delivered, and set in the right way to Heaven. If you take it thus, you are pitifully out: for our Saviour hath fore-told that into the 
                  Math. 7. 13 
                  wide gate & broad way, that leadeth to destruction, many there be which enter; but the straight gate and narrow way that leadeth vnto life, few there be that finde. And it was reveiled vnto Iohn, that with the whore of Babylon the 
                  Apoc. 17. 2. 
                  Kings of the earth committed fornication, & the inhabitours of the earth are drunken with the wine of her fornication. And experience hath confirmed, that not only the Saracene doctrin hath for almost these thousād yeeres possessed the shew & face of many great countries; but time out of mind, very Gentilisme & Heathenisme have raigned in the East & West Indies, in the Ilands neere adioyning, in diverse parts of Africa, in Lappia, and many other countries, the name of Iesus our Redeemer (for ought that of certainty can be found) till of late yeeres being scant ever heard of among them. Or doe you rather vnderstand those speeches of all Nations cōming vnto him, & of all being drawne vnto Christ, to carry this sence, that the Gentiles nowe, as well as formerly the Iewes, should bee admitted, and moreover that the word should bee spreade to the East and to the VVest, and to the North and to the Southe, so that before the day of iudgment, God should have some faithfull in everie quarter; and

sometimes when his Church did flourish many thousands in diverse places, and alwaies some servants some-where? In this meaning if you take it, we willingly ioyne with you, the rather induced thervnto by the nature of the word, All, in the Scriptures, and by the manner of the fulfilling of those Prophecies in the Church, in such a sort as with reason cannot be gaine-saide. For as All in holy writte doth evermore at least signifie many, so it doth not cōtinually importe a generality without any sort of exception. When it is saide that to Iohn the Baptist Math. 3. 5. 
                  vvent out Hierusalem and all Iewry, and all the region round about Iordan, it is not meant that no individuall person did stay at home, but many of all sortes, rich and poore, young and olde, men and women, such a company as if almost all the country had come in, were partakers of his Baptisme. So Tit 2. 11. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  the grace of God hath appeared, which bringeth salvation to all men, saith Saint Paule to Titus. Like to which is that to Timothy, 
                  1. Tim. 2. 4. 
                  God our Saviour, who will that all men shall be saved; where All intendeth many, or diverse of diverse sorts, not vniversally every one. He will have all to be saved, saith Gregory, 
                  In 1. Reg. 14. 
                  because out of every sort of men hee chooseth those whome hee draweth to the ioye of everlasting salvation. And Aquinas himselfe among other interpretations of that later place, hath this, Part 1. q. 19. a. 6. 
                  It may bee vnderstood that the distribution must be made pro generibus singulorum, and not, pro singulis generum, according to this sence: God vvill have of every state of men to be saved: males and females, Iewes and Gentiles, smal and great, but not all of every severall state. And who will say that in every particular countrie of Asia, or the continent toward the South pole, or many other quarters of the world, the Church of Christ hath alwaies apparantly bin? The Romanists of al other must not say so; if they will have the cōgregation of Gods faithful to extēd it selfe no further thē their doctrine & the Popes vsurpatiō doth goe. For they cannot prove that ever those regions heard of the name of the Romane Bishop vntill this last age, if now they doe, or have lately done. This thē we grant vnto you: that Christ Iesus hath evermore a Church, & that variously dispersed vnder the cope of heavē, not boūded within narrow precincts, as that of the Iewes was. The goodly titles also which in the word are givē vnto it, are ever true in respect of the purity of religiō, but especially

for the fundamental points which finally cōcerne salvation. And they are also as true for the visible glory of the church in time of peace & the free course of the Gospel: but are not perpetually & without interruption, to be vnderstood for the patent extent of the same, & that gloriously & apparātly to be in any one countrey of the world, as the defenders of the Romane Hierarchy would chalenge to themselves.

               FOR before the comming of the Messias, the people of the Iewes, & many others also in other Lands, which were of the Iewish Religion, vvere in some sorte farre from the bondage of the Devill; but since his comming both Iewes and Gentiles and almost all Nations, Tribes and Kingdomes have bin ever in Lucifers thraldome vntill this our age, in which Luther came to expell Lucifer, and to ridde all the world out of his captivity. And so the passion of our Redeemer availed little or nothing at all, for the space of these fifteene hundred yeeres; & for a thousand yeeres together hee was so farre from drawing all vnto him as hee said hee would do, that he drew not so much as one person that any mā can name. And in Ioh. 12. our Country there of England, it is most manifest that all were Papistes without exception from the first Christening thereof, vntill this age of King Henry the eight.

                  have bin ever in Lucifers thraldome vntill this our age, in which Luther came to expell Lucifer &c. I wōder that you can suffer the name of Luther to passe so quietly without some egregious contumely:

but keeping it for him you only stay it a while, & anon he shall have it. But being heere in the heigth of that argument, which above all other pleaseth your side, and the very rehearsing whereof (as you woulde make your doating followers beleeve) doth make vs all Campian Ration. 3. looke pale; you amplifie your former proposition, that if this be yeelded vnto, Christs passion availed little or nothing at all for fifteene hundred yeeres; but for a thousand yeeres hee vvas so farre from drawing all vnto him, that he drewe not so much as one person that any man can name. This is spoken like a man of some mettal indeede: & by this shal your disciples know how to trust you hereafter. But as if yet you had deserved but one end of a sharpingstone, and meant to have the rest with you before that you depart, you tel vs that in our own coūtry, there of England, (which whether you speake with some contept or no, your selfe can best discover) it is most manifest that all were Papists without exception, from the first Christening therof, vntill this age of King Henry the eight. You are a blessed companion, & a man may beleeve much vpon your word. Doubtlesse you perswade your selfe that all, who should reade your booke, would be madde, or drunke, or senselesse, or else you must thinke that they would admitte and admire you for a singular lyar. Besides that of Antiquitie, the vvritings and testimony of your owne men, will convince you in this to have neither wit nor shame. VVe make it good against you, that the thousands and ten thousands of the servants of God in the Primitive Church knew at the first nothing; and afterwards but little of your blasphemous Popery, and that not in the mainest points: And albeit in processe of time, superstitiō (as it was 2. Thes. 2. 3. 1. Tim. 4. 1. 2. Pet. 2. 1. foretold) did by little and little creepe in, yet in all ages God had his Church of such as did not spotte their soules with your horrible contammations: And we maintaine it, that in our owne lande there were testimonies most luculent, of such as detested the Antichristiā pride, & other loose behaviour of the Romane Clergy, both in doctrin & manners, & served the Lord after the prescript of his owne word, as now we do endevor to do. If you know not this Mr. Doctor, you have reade but little, & so in some sort we question your scholarship: or else you have reade it, and so wee question your conscience. But vvee vvill hope the best, that it is

your ignorance: although these present propositions and many other in your booke, doe give vs great occasion to suspect your honest conscience. Your owne men will be ashamed, that you talke in this fashion, as anon you shall perceive. But I follow you a while.

               AND so the Protestants affirme of other Countries, & boldly say, Luther in postil Ger. 1537 part. 2. fol. 141. that vntill this age, the Gospell lay in the dust, & was hiddē vnder the bench, and Christ was vnknowne. Which to say (as the Protestants must needes say, and blush not to say indeede) is meere madnes and flat infidelitie, and a plaine denying of Christ, and no small establishment of Mahomets Religion. For the Protestantes and Mahumetanes agree in this, that the Church which Christ founded, fell some five or sixe hundred yeeres after his ascension, into most horrible errours, and then (say the Turkes) the Angell Gabriel was sent from God to Mahomet, to teach him hovve hee shoulde reforme the saide Church, because it would not stande with the wisedome and goodnesse of Almight
                     •…
                   God to suffer his Church to vanish avvaie through errours and superstitions, vvithout sending in time to reforme it. And in this, out of doubte, the Turkes have farre greater reason then the Protestantes have, vvhich Protestants by their doctrin make Christ the most simple & most improvident Lavve-giver that ever was in the vvorld. For neither Plato, Solon, Lycurgus nor any other Lavv-maker vvhosoever, was so simple and improvident as to fashion and plant a Common-wealth, which before it were vvell setled should vanish away and come to nothing, having no sufficient meanes to prevent errours, and such abuses as would ever throvve their Lawes, & destroy their Cm̄on wealths. And therfore if Christ bee God, & the holy Bible true, the Religion of the Papists must needes be that Religion which he ordained, and left to all generations, and consequently the onely true and right Religion.
            
            
               G. ABBOT.
               10 SInce by your last fore-going wordes, it hath appeared to bee your profession, in your owne person to speake largely, it is most probable that to the vttermost you will racke and pervert the speeches of other. There is neither Luther nor any other Protestāt

so absurd, as to say according to that which you would intimate heere, that there was no Church till of late, & that the Gospell was absolutely hidden, or Christ simplie vnknowne vntill their daies. For we well vnderstand, & teach cōtrary-wise, that in the Primitive Church plentifully, & afterward alwaies more or lesse, in some parts of the world or other, there were the Elect of God, who groning to behould the common errours of their age, did strive to beleeve and live after the rule of the Scriptures. But the speech of Luther & of vs in that behalfe is comparative: that in comparison of that which it should bee: or that which had bin not long after the Apostles: or in respect of that which the Lord hath of late reveiled: or of that which by the faithfull might have bin wished, the Gospel had not for some later ages, so free a course, and Christ was not so ordinarlly & vnpollutedly taught; but the Bible lay much neglected, and was cast aside in comparison of other bookes. And while we acknowledge this, we need not to blush, neither is it madnesse in vs, but 
                  Act. 26. 25 
                  the words of truth and sobernes, as Saint Paule said in a like vniust accusation: nor yet infidelity, or denying of Christ, or the establishing of Mahomets Religion. Heere you heape vp many wordes, but are not able to prove the least part of your owne Propositions: wee must therefore give you leave to say much, & conclude nothing. Your vniust imputatiō that not only in this, but in diverse other matters, we ioyne with the Turkes, you borrow of Doctor Gefford, who no lesse slaunderously then crakingly, pretēdeth to do great things in his Calvino-Turcismus. (The maliciousnes wherof is already displayed, and the crime returned by a learned D. Sutliv. in Turco. Papismo. man vpon the Papists themselves.) It is to be hoped that the Authour thereof will either in time repent him and turne to grace, or receive the reward of his blasphemous speeches against Christs Religion, & his venimous revilings against his naturall Prince & country. In the meane while he may looke to the clearing of his credit, from the accusations of father Parsons, 
                  Parsons manifestation cap. 1. & 7. who describeth him to be very ill qualified, & no better thē a fire-brād in kindling dissension evē among the English fugitives of the Romane Colledge. But for our parts, know you, ô the whole rable of the Romish generatiō, that vvee from the bottome of our heartes detest Turcisme and

Mahumetisme, and know that Mahomet was a false Prophet, & never had Angel, (vnlesse it were one of darknes) sent vnto him. And as touching the Church of Rome, we are not ignorant that before the daies of Mahomet, it did by little & little decline, but in the time of Phocas the Emperour & Boniface Vide Plat. in Bonif. 3. the third, then Pope, (which was neere to the daies of Mahomet) the malignity of it did grow much greater. And since that season, the mistery of iniquity hath wrought forward & forward, & it is almost grown to the ruine of it selfe. But in al this time the Cōgregatiō of Gods servāts was never extinct, not the Church brought to such passe, as that Mahomet one of the great enimies of Christianity should neede to reforme it. His reformation was deformation, and to his power he would like the Psa 80. 13. Boare of the Forrest, haue rooted vp Christs vine-yard. If then you will vnderstande what it is which we doe teach, the Turkes haue not so much as in shew, any the like reason for their most vaine assertion, as we haue for our position; since our doctrine in this case is laid vpon a sure foundatiō, which with all your invectiues you shall no more be able to impeach, thē you can hurt the Moone with stones throwne against her. Neither do we make Christ a simple & improvident law-giver, but wise, & wisdome it selfe in al his actions, since he determined before hand what he would haue done, & that not after your imaginations, but after the depth & purpose of his own coūsaile; & accordingly in time he perfourmed it. For he had ever those who were his Congregation, & Common-wealth, observing his statutes; & this regiment was better setled then that of Solon or Lycurgus was, the precincts of whose government were boūded within the territories of the Spartane & Athenien Iurisdictiō, & in the compasse of some hundreds of years came to their period & end. But this of our Saviour is restrained within no limits of time, (but is perpetual,) nor circuite of place, otherwise then as it seemeth good to his infinite wisdome, to restraine or to enlarge it. Now whereas you ioine here with Solon and Lycurgus the law-giver Plato, I pitty your over-sight. For that Cōmon-wealth which Plato imaginarily erected, did indeede vanish away and come to nothing, before it was setled. For all men of learning can tell you, that there never was any such matter in rerum natura,
                  
but in his bookes De 
                  Platon. Dialog. de Rep. 
                  Republica he propounded speculatiuely, what was to be striven and contended for, if wee could attaine to perfection. But if I should aske you in what City, or within the compasse of what Country it was established, you cānot answer me: vnlesse after much study you should remember your selfe, & reply that it was in Sir Thomas Moores Vtopia, and famous Citizens there, were Aristotles Felix, and Tullyes Oratour, & Castilios Courtier; and Xenophons Cyrus albeit hee could not bee a Monarch there, yet caryed the mainest sway. Wel, I pardon you this fault: notwithstanding requesting you to put it among your negligences and ignorances; and telling you withall, that our boyes and ordinary scholers, in those Rat. 15. Vniversities which you seeme to vi
                     •…
                  sie, can informe you, that Plato was a Law-maker, and a Common-wealth establisher, but by imagination. And so nothing here said doth hinder, but that Christ may be God, as indeed he is Rom. 9. 5. 
                  God over all, blessed for ever, and the holy Bible true, as verily it is the sacred rule of truth; and yet the Religion of the Papists is not that Religion which Christ ordained, or left to all generations, but a meere profanation of his Word & Sacramentes, a horrible abomination, the service of Antichrist, idolatry and superstition. And so I let you breath a while
                     •…
                  dismissing you notwithstanding with this close, that although in this Chapter you tooke some more paines then you meant to doe hereafter, because this is the front of your booke, yet the ground of this your formost Tracte is taken from the Motiv. 37. & 45. seven and thirtith, and fiue & fortith Motive of Bristow; you, to colour the matter, placing the end almost of his booke in the beginning of yours. But here-after you wil shew your selfe more plainely, as from Chapter to Chapter I shall remember you.
               11 ANd heere the Christian Reader will pardon me, if partly to shew the ignorance and indiscreete folly of this fresh gamesler, and partly to stoppe the mouthes of other our clamorous adversaries, but especially to satisfie the weake, I doe adde something more in the former argument, although by diverse of our men much heeretofore hath beene suide to that purpose, both in English and Latine. VVee doe therefore teach, that as from the beginning long before the incarnation of Christ, God

ever had his Church, yet sometimes more visible and glorious, and sometimes more contracted and obscured; so since the appearance of our Saviour, at all times infallibly & without exception, there haue beene chosen children of God, who haue retained his faith, & calling vpon his name haue studyed to expresse their knowledge in their life, by retiring themselues both from the loose conversation of Libertines, and the profanations of Idolatrous persons. Neither ever was there any of our profession, which did teach or write the contrary. But whereas the Synagogue of Rome lay it downe for a fundamentall rule, that this Church hath beene and must be in all ages, a visible and conspicuous congregation at the least, consisting of an apparant Hierarchy, so that at all times a man may point it out, and may repaire thither as to a matter eminent, yea and in a sort pompous too, or to say as Stapleton speaketh when hee doth most extenuate it, In Antid. Matth 24. 
                  It is evermore visible in respect of her governours and sheepe-heards, but most of all for the Pope or chiefe Pastour thereof; to which Pope, De Roma. no Pontif. 4. 4. Bellarmine assigneth, that he cannot erre in iudgement, and to the people and Cleargy of Rome (where this sensible Church must principally be) that they cannot erre with a personall errour, so that all altogether erre; we therein doe dissent from them, & maintaine that although when the godly are most driven to extremities, by heresies or persecutions, they be visible each to other, & acquainted with some other brethren who are in like case vvith themselues, yet they are not so apparant to other men, as that at all times they know where to finde assemblies, and congregations of them. But that the Bishop of Rome and his Pontificall Cleargy, should haue the face of the Church tyed, and inseparably ioined vnto them, we can in no sort yeeld, but doe disclaime it as a flattering tale, suggested to that Bishop by such parasites as are about him, and from time to time doe depend vpon him.
               12 And that it may be seene what reason we haue of this our assertiō, we first shew, that the estate of the faithful was frequently so, before the cōming of Christ. For when it lay as hid in some few persons, within the single families of the old Patriarkes, before and after the flowd, what great boast could there be made of it? Nay when the Common-wealth of the Iews was much setled,

into what straights was it brought, when David complained, Psal. 12. 1. 
                  Helpe Lord for there is not a godly man lest: for the faithfull are failed from among the children of men; this being spoken, as it is most probable, in the daies of Saul, after the death of Samuel, and the 1. Sam. 22. 18. slaughter of the Priests. How was it even in Iudah and Hierusalē, when Esay cryed out, that the 
                  Isai. 1. 5. 6. 
                  whole head is sicke, and the whole heart is heavy? from the soale of the foote vnto the head there is nothing whole therin; the estate of the Church being then most miserable, and all depraved, not only in manners, but in religion, Idolatry beeing plentifull as is manifest by the words in the same vision, vers. 29. 
                  for they shall be confounded for the Okes, which yee haue desired, and yee shall be ashamed of the gardens which yee haue chosen, which intendeth the trees and pleasant places where they vsed their superstitions. Call to minde the daies of leremy, when he said, Ier. 5. 1. 
                  Runne to & fro by the streetes of Hierusalem, and beholde now and know and inquire in the open places therof, if yee can finde a man, or if there be any that executeth iudgement, and seeketh the truth, and I will spare it: And those of Ezechiel testifying in this sort, I 
                  Ezech 22. 30. 
                  sought for a man among them that should make vp the hedge, and stande in the gappe before mee for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none. These things were said of Iudah and Hierusalem, where alone at that time was that Church which was, the Israelites for their grievous sinnes being long before caryed away into captivitie. You may adde to this, if you wil, the complaint of Micah, Micah. 7. 1 
                  We is me, for I am as the Somer gatherings, and as the grapes of the vintage: there is no cluster to 
                        〈◊〉
                      my soule desired the first ripe fruites. The good man is perished out of the earth, and there is none righteous among men: they all lie in waite for blond: every man 
                        •…
                     teth his brother with a net. If the Priests & people had not almost generally gone astray, and the whole face of the visible Church had not seemed to be defaced, would these Prophets thus haue particularized, that one godly man was not left, that one was not to bee founde who had not declined from truth?
               13 We doubt not but in those times the Lord had many faithfull ones in secret, as he had seaven thousand in Israell when 1. King. 19. 18. Rom 11 4. Elias lived, of whom neither the enemies of the truth, nor scant that Prophet did take any notice. The Ezech. 9. 4 Apoc. 7 3. marke in the foreheade

is sometime knowne to fewe, but onely to him who imprinted it there; yet this is a good holde for the Elect, 2. Tim. 2. 19. 
                  The Lordknovveth who are his. But vpō what might those, who were Gods secret chosen, out wardly build, when diverse times the Princes and people had corrupted their waies, and the Temple it selfe was polluted and made a sinke of Idolatry? For wee find that things stood vpō those termes in the daies of Manasse, vvhen in the house of the Lord, even that house whereof the Lord had saide, 2. Reg. 21. 4. 5. 
                  In Hierusalem will I put my name, he built profane altars: and in the two courtes of the house of the Lord he built altars for all the hoste of Heaven. Iudge where in those daies was the glory of the visible church, or where it was a pretty while before that, whē the Priest 2. Reg. 16 11. 
                  Vriah was as ready to set vp in the tēple an altar after the fashiō of that which was in Damascus, as the King Ahaz was ready to cōmād it. And then the Prince & Priests cōspiring, there was scāt any kind of grosse Idolatry, which was not plētifully cōmitted. Ahaz himselfe making Vers. 3. 
                  his son to goe through the fire after the abominations of the Heathē. And least it should be thought that the people at least, did amend somewhat which was amisse, in the very next Chapter it is witnessed in generall, 2 Reg. 17. 19. 
                  Yet Iudah kept not the cōmandements of the Lord their God, but walked according to the fashion of Israell which they vsed. And by most probability, this outrage vnder Isa. 1. 1. Ahaz was the tune, against which Esay so inveighed in the visiō before remembred. These things are so plaine, that the greatest pillars of the Papacy cānot deny thē; & therfore they are forced to another shift, as the Rhemists whē they say, In Rom. 11. 4. 
                  that there is a great differēce between the Christian Church & the Iewes, ours resting vpō better promises then the
                        •…
                     s; which is a very poore eva
                     •…
                  ion, in as much as every Divine may knowe, that there bee as large and many promises, that the Church of the Iewes should last vntill Christs appearance in the flesh, as there be that the Cōgregatiō of Gods Saints, shal cōtinue among the Gētiles vntil the day of Iudgmēt. And saving only for the time of the Babylonish captivity, there was one set externall place of Gods eminēt service, that is, the Tēple at Ierusalē, supported with such words, Psal. 132. 
                  This is my rest for ever: heere will I dwell, &c. &, 2. Chr. 33. 4. 
                  In Ierusalē shal my 
                        •…
                     me be for ever; she like wherof throughout al the cōtinuance of the new Testamēt, is not warrantable out of the word, for any one place whatsoever. No it cānot so much as

superficially be maintained out of the Scripture that Rome it selfe hath any such promise: but rather out of the Revelatiō of St. Iohn there are many substātial matters which make to the contrary.
               14. But because by the strōg shot of truth, they be beatē frō the bulwarke of the Iewish Synagogue, & fly to the next hold of the later Testamēt, let vs follow thē thither. Whē our Saviour Christ was borne, & for the most part afterward till hee was baptized, where shal we cōceive, was the visible Church? The Scribes and Pharisees possessed al the shew, & they were no better thē 
                  Mat. 23. 24 blind guides of the blind. The 2. Mach 4. 8. 24. c. 11. 3. Ioseph. de bel. Iud 4. 5 & lib. 5. 9. Priest-hood was long before and after bought & sold; & in Christs own time, it is evidēt out of the Scrip ture, that the highest spiritual dignity going by Ioh. 11. 51. yeeres, Annas & Caiphas & other vnworthy mē of that rabble did enioy it. Vpō the birth of Iesus, they were not glad who should most have reioyced in it, but al Ierusalem was Math. 2. 3. troubled at it. And how they persisted afterward till Christ did manifest himselfe fully, may be guessed by diverse circūstances, which the Evāgelists do mētion after his birth. But whē he came first into the world, of whom do we find speech made, but of some shep-heards in the field, of Simeon an old mā, of Anna a most aged womā; both ready to goe into their graves, of Ioseph & Mary, Zacharias & Elizabeth and very fewe other? And of these some might be soone dead, other lived out of the way, at Beth-lehem or Nazareth or in Aegypt, & the shepheards were in the fields about their trade; but where there was the apparācy of a visible cōgregatiō, cā hardly be imagined. Whē our Saviour had selected out his Apostles, they then were termed by the name of a Flock, but yet by their master they were called but a Luc. 12. 32. 
                  little flocke, where the Rhemists do confesse, that Rhemens. ibi. 
                  in the beginning it was little indeed. At the death of Christ, whē his body hanged on the Crosse for our sakes, & his disciples were Math. 26. 56. all fled, no man daring to shew himselfe, Ioh. 19. 25. Nic. Cleman. de mater▪ Cō
                     cil. 
                  Mary & Iohn & a few womē were al the faithful that now appeared vpō earth. And afterward while the Apostles & their followers walked very privately, or were assēbled in a Act. 1. 13. chāber, the Priests, & Scribes & Pharisies were they who 
                     •
                  uffled it in the streets, & bore the sway in the Tē
                  ple: so that if a weak body had enquired for the church, he might rather have bin directed to thē, who had the law & the altars & al

sacred things in their custody, then to any other. When Act. 8. 1. Steevē had beene stoned, and for feare of the persecution, which was at Hierusalem, the disciples were all scattered besides the Apostles, it may well be presumed that for a time, they which remained in the citty, where Steevē had lost his life, did not walke very opē
                  ly. Truth it is that after these things the Church was better setled, and the truth was more spread: but yet never was there any such priviledge bestowed vpon it, but that in the daies of persecutiō, or some grievous Apostasie, the faithful might be brought to a smal visibility.
               15 Our Saviours words intend so much, when alluding to the time of his second appearāce, to iudge the quicke & the dead, he asketh, Luk 18. 8. 
                  Neverthelesse, when the sonne of man commeth, shall hee finde faith on the earth? as meaning that very little should then be to be found, in comparison of the flowds and Ocean of iniquity, which every where should abound. But God to the end that he might not haue vs ignorāt, but warned before hand, into what straights the Church should be brought, informeth vs by Saint Paul, that the Lord shall not come, except there first be an 2. Thes. 2. 3 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Apostasie, or revolt, or falling away, wherein Antichrist with great pride and disdaine should shew himselfe. This is solemnely spoken of by the Apostle, & by al both old & new intreating of it, is observed to signifie some matter of great note, that is to say, some maine declining from somewhat. Many of our Papists fearing to touch this soare which can in no case turne them to good, would haue this interpreted to note nothing else, but the slipping of divers regions & countries, frō their subiection to the Romane Empire. But Gregory Martin and the other Rhemists, being overcome with the evidence of truth, are heere a litle more honest then ordinary, and speake to other purpose. Indeede they cannot tell how it will be taken at other Papists hands, that contrary to the custome of their fellows, in a matter of such moment, they should giue way vnto vs, and therefore they doe vse these words in way of excuse, be 
                  Rhemens. in 2. Thes. 2 3. 
                  it spoken vnder the correction of Gods church, & al learned Catholikes. But to the point, concerning the Apostasie they deliver this; It is very like that this great defection and revolt, shall not be only from the Romane Empire, but specially from the Romane church,
                  
                  and withall, from most pointes of Christian Religion. In the margent it is, and from most articles of the Catholike faith. Here they would haue vs take the Romish beleefe, for the Christian Religion & Catholike faith: but that deserveth a long pause. We rather obserue out of them, that this revolt is in matter of faith, and not onely from the Empire; then which glosse nothing can be truer. Well then, if there must be so egregious an Apostasie, it wil follow, that Antichrist so dominering, as by the Apostle he is described, will not be negligent so to represse the publike service of God, that it shall not carry any liuely head or countenance, where he hath to doe. So that certainely our Rhemists yeelding to this exposition, doe in substance confesse so much, as that the apparencie of Gods congregation, in the time of the great defection, must bee mightely eclipsed. Now the Lord, to the end that he might establish his faithfull, and arme them to expect this paucity of beleevers, and inconspicuousnes of his Church, and yet not be discouraged for that which should be past, present, or to come; and againe that there might be no doubt in a matter of this moment, letteth vs farther know, that the 
                  Apoc. 12. 6 
                  womā fled into the wildernes, where shee hath a place prepared of God. It is not doubted of betweene the Romanists & vs, but that this woman doth represēt the church, concerning whom being in the wildernes, it doth manifestly follow, that for the time of her aboad there, which the Almightie had decreed, shee should not be discerned; that is, by her enemies, who did and would chase her: not withstanding it be not to be doubted, but shee knew where her selfe was. If the Romanist therefore and persecuting Adversary, did not ever see the professors of the Gospel, it was no wonder, the woman was to remaine in the wildernes apart & hid from them. The evidence of which matter is such, that as Master In praefat. super Apocalyps. Foxe observeth, for feare of divers things in the Revelation of S. Iohn (wherof this may worthily be one) scant any Popish writer for many yeares togither, durst adventure to comment any thing vpon the Apocalyps, vntill our Rhemists being desirous to shame the Pope & themselues, with all who are wise, adventured to set penne to paper. Having then a purpose to set foorth, and corrupt the New Testament, partly by their Translation, but most of all by their Annotations, they

may not chuse but say somewhat of the Revelation, although they professe that it is as In argument. Apocalyps. & in Apoc. 1. 1. sparingly as may be, & as briefly; which is not for that the volume of the Rhemish Testament groweth great, as they would colour it, but for feare least they should too much lay open their owne weaknesse, which while that booke is in the Bible, will never be concealed. Howsoever therefore through their volume, in many maine matters they be very silent, vvhere they should most speak; as of the question of imputed righteousnes, where the Rom 4. vi de Ration. 14. Apostle doth most handle it, (a

                  Church, flying from the great persecution which shall bee in the time of Antichrist. Indeede to keepe peace with their Lord and Master the Pope, they will not haue this flight to be, but in the very ending of the world, and so they would fetch it with a back racket, that the woman should continue so in secret, but three yeares & an halfe, which (to keepe all vpright) they assigne to be the time of Antichrists raigne, & then the iudgement must come; which is a most fonde evasion, seeing by that means men living at the appearance of Antichrist, should bee able precisely to tell, when the last day should be, to wit, three yeares and a halfe after Antichrists entring. But of 
                  Mark. 13. 32. 
                  that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in heaven, neither the Sonne himselfe, saue the Father only. It can never be made good, that the Apoc. 11. 2 3. c. 12. 6. c. 13. 5. Dan 7 25. time, times, and halfe a time, the two and forty moneths, and the thousand two hundred and sixty daies, are so literally to be taken, as that they should containe exactly three ordinary yeares and a halfe. Your Romane Bishop in his declination, hath already beene in the world much longer, and he is the greatest Antichrist that ever yet was manifested among men, and on whom many things in the Scripture signified touching Antichrist, do directly and vnavoidably light.

                  The whole vvorld did sigh, & wondred that it selfe was Arrian. The words are but fewe, but they are to the purpose. So said Gregorius Presbiter, writing the life of Gregory Nazianzen, The secte of the Arriās had almost possessed al the coastes of the world, the
                  
                  power, & impiety of the Emperour ministring boldnes vnto it. The words of Constātius himselfe in Theodor. Hist. Eccles. lib. 2. 16. 
                  Theodoret, do give testimony vnto this; neither doth Liberius the Roman Bishop say ought to the cōtrary. The speeches of the Arrian Emperour, against him & Athanasius are these. The whole vvorld doth thinke that this is well. The whole world hath givē sentēce of his impiety. Thou alone dost embrace the friēdship of that wicked man. And a litle before that: Doth so great a part of the world reside in thee Liberius, that thou alone dost dare to come in aide to that wicked mā, & disturb the peace of the vniversal world? Whervnto Liberius did not take exceptiō, saying that the visible Church stood for him & Athanasius, but rather giveth another reason, to make good his being alone. Be it, that I am alone. Notwithstāding, for that, the cause of the faith is not the worse. For a great while agone, there were three only foūd, who would resist the Kings cōmandemēt. Heere the Church for any external shew was low brought: for if any body held it vp, it was Athanasius, who thē plaied least in sight & durst not appeare. For this Liberius who did for a time second him, did afterward shrinke. He went at first into banishmēt in defence of the truth, but after that, he was so sollicited & laid at by Hieron. in Catalog. script. Eccles. 
                  Fortunatianus, that he relēted & cōdescended to subscribe to the Arrian heresy, as Hierome witnesseth, who lived in that age, & was longe cōversant in Rome, & therfore could better report what was the issue of Liberius his cōstācy, thē some other who do relate it otherwise.

It is no more then often times fell out vnder the Iewish Synagogue, and hath bin exemplified to have beene since among the Christians, & was so evidently foretolde before. In so much that by the example of the Apoc. 12. 6. woman, it cannot be the true Church, vnlesse it should be hidde in the wildernes: Which while our Popish teachers deny to agree to their Romish Church, but professe that it hath ever bin in sight, they thēselves do by a cōsequēt proclaime, that they are not the pure

As principal parties herein, I name Iohn Hus & Hierome of Prage, & al such as were their scholers, in or about Bohemia: who before Luthers time oppugned the beliefe of the Church of Rome▪ and their professiō was not extinguished vntil his dates, howsoever it before had bin mainly assaulted: If we could learn this no where els, yet Fraūcis Guicciardine, an Italiā & Florētine Historiographer would informe vs of it, who Histor. l. 13. writing of the yeere 1520, saith plainly that Luther did set abroad the Heresies (as he tearmeth thē) of the Bohemiās, & he nameth there Hus & Hierome, as former divulgers of the same.

Within an hundred yeeres after him came M. Luther, according as the saide Iohn Hus did Io. Foxus in Histor. Ecclesiastic. prophecy not long before his death. And whē it is added, that yet hee doth not cease to slaye, it is manifest that his doctrine remained till the daies of Cochlues. In another Cochl. lib. 2. place hee relateth, that Luther did stirre vp seditions in Germany, by the bookes of the Hussites. Afterward hee calleth those, who were in Germany in his time, Ibidem.

He proceedeth in the same matter Lib. 3. elsewhere, saying, that the people of Germany are now by Luther partakers of the heresies of Hus and Hierome. One sorte of the followers of this Iohn Hus, did call themselves Thaborites, and these were they, who most dissented of all other from the doctrine of Rome. Of these hee speaketh thus: Lib. 8. 
                  Unto this day remaineth the secte of the Thaborites, in manie places of Bohemia and Moravia, vnder the

                  hee may see the remainders or leavings of the Hussites to returne to the Church, and the Germanes to cast out all nevve sectes. VVhat can bee more evident, then that the doctrine of Iohn Hus vvas sensiblie and apparantly continued somewhere, even till the daies of Martin Luther? Vnto which may be added, that wheras Luther began to shew himselfe but in the yeere 1517. that very yeere was Centur. 16. lib. 1. 20. ended the Coūcel of Laterane, held at Rome, & finished by Pope Leo the tēth.

               19 And as these testimonies do cōvince, that the Christiā cōfessiō of Hus was not extinguished at the cōming of M. Luther, so may there be good reasō assigned why it did so lōg cōtinue, in as much as it was embraced by many, & earnestly maintaned evē vnto the death. Whē

These three persons were martyred for this speech, & tooke their death patiently. In small processe of time this doctrin so multiplied, that as Onuphrius hath, In tabula Concil. ante Platinae Histor. the Councell of Constance was called principally for two things; the one was against the Hussites, the other to take away the sehisme betweene the Popes. These of likely-hood grew great, that now a general Coūcel was called against thē. Neither did the people only agree in faith with Iohn Hus, but the Nobles of Bohemia stood apparātly for him, in so much that they sent two Io. Fox. in Concil. Constant. Historia. severall & solēne supplicatiōs to the Coūcel at Cōstāce in his behalf. And whē these their requests were neglected, & Iohn Hus & Hierome of Prage (cōtrary to the Emperours safe cōduct given to the former of thē) were burnt, the Nobles Cochl l. 4. of Bohemia did mightily murmure against the fathers of the Coūcell, insomuch that Sigismund the Emperour to give them satisfaction on his behalfe, did write vnto thē, excusing himself touching the death of these two mē, & laying the fault vpō the Coūcel. But this gave not cōtentmēt to the Bohemiās, now robbed of their principal pastour, but being moved at the perfidiousnes of those at Cōstance, they assē
                  bled thēselves togither to the nūber of Ibidem. thirty thousād, & in the fields, vpō three hūdred tables erected for that purpose, they received the Eucharist in both kinds. Afterward they rushing into the Churches & Monasteries, did break down the Images there. It was not long after, but that vnder Iohannes Zisca, a noble & victorious warriour, these Hussites grew to bee of souldiours Lib. 5. & Petr Messias in Sigismundo. forty thousāds in one army, who got into their hāds the castle of Prage the chief city of Bohemia. Thē not long after did Pope Martin the 5. publish a Croisado against these whō he called Heretikes, promising remissiō of their sins to such as could destroy them. Notwithstāding, these hated persōs did stil prosper, getting many victories

vnder Procopius & other Captaines, but especially vnder Zisca, who was of that dexterity and felicity in his warres, as that Cochleus almost amased at his strange successe, saith, that Lib. 5. 
                  scāt any history of the Greekes or Hebrewes or Latins, doth mētiō such a Generall as Zisca was. He built a new city as a refuge for his mē, & called it. Thabor, wherof diverse embracing the doctrine of Hus were afterward called Thaborites. A Lib. 6 secōd time time did Pope Martin proclaime a Croisado against thē, granting remissiō of sins to al, who did either fight or cōtribute mony against thē. Vpon which there were at one time forty Ibidem. thousād Germaine horsemē gathered to destroy thē: but such was the terror of their name, that vpō the approaching to thē, the horsemē of their own accord turned their backs & fled. The Popish Auctor saith that there was in this some secret iudgmēt of God, but he thinketh the cause of their ill successe was, that they had Bishops & Priests to their leaders & Cap taines. By this time came on the Coūcel of Basil, which as In tabula ante Platinam. 
                  Onuphrius saith was helde against the Hussites. This sheweth that they were many; which may also appeare, in that the Fathers at Basil, did by an indulgēce grāt to the Bohemiās this dispēsutiō, that cō

                  The Councell doth permitte the Eucharist vnder both kindes, not tolerating it only as a thing evil, as to the Iewes was permitted a bill of divorce, but so, that by the auctority of Christ & his Church it is lawful, & profitable to the worthie receivers. Where, is it likely, that vnlesse the Bohemians now after Husses death had bin a strōg party, the Antichristian rabble would have yeelded to their importunitie, so directlie against the Canon of the nexte precedent Councel?

Which noble testimony of that worthy Poggius is acknowledged by Lib 3. Cochleus. While these two lived, there were diverse Lib 2. priests, & Lib. 1. preachers, which agreed in their Doctrine, & in their Sermons reproved the Popish Cleargy for their Simony, keeping of Concub

But after the death of those two famous servāts of God, their Lib. 4. followers got to them a Bishop, who was Suffragane to the Arch-bishop of Prage, and by him they put into holy Orders as many Clerkes as they would. Which the Arch-bishop tooke so il, that he suspended his Suffragane. But it was not long before that Lib. 5. Cōradus the Arch-bishop himselfe, became a Hussite also, as the Author calleth him. Vnder this Conradus as president of the assembly, these Hussites held a Coūcel at Prage in the year 1421. & there they compiled a Cō

Barons of Bohemia afterward stifly mainetaine, and complained against the Emperor Sigismūd, for offring wrong to those of their Religion. Ibidem. Alexander also the Duke of Lituania did giue these Hushtes aide, which moved Pope Martin the 5, to write vnto him in this sort, Know that thou couldst not giue thy faith to heretikes which are the

Thus did the vertuous Pope write. In Lib. 8. processe of time there grew a parley, betweene Sigismund the Emperour & the Bohemians. There among the Compacts this was one, that the Bishops should promote to holy Orders the Bohemians, even Hussites, which were of the Universitie of Prage. And they might well deserue to be reputed Vniversity mē; for Cochleus himselfe witnesseth, that the Priests of the Thaborits were skilled in arg

                  governed by heretiks. Now all the Nobility, all the Cōminalty is subiect to an heretike. That was one George or Gyrziko, Governor of the kingdome of Bohemia vnder king Lad

                     •…
                  slaus was dead, this Lib. 12. George himselfe was by the Nobles and the People chosen King of that country. And continuing the auncient profession of his Religion, about the yeare 1458, those of Uratislavia and Silesia doe refuse to obey him as being an heretike. Notwithstanding Pope Pius the 2. then intending warres against tho Turke, did by all meanes perswade thē, that they should yeeld obedience to him. This George, saith the Authour, was borne and brought vp in the heresie of the Hussites. Now when Pope Pius did interpose himselfe, as a mediatour betweene this King and his Subiects, George did require of the Pope, that he might keepe the Compacts agreed vpon at Basill, in behalfe of the Bohemians. And when Ibidem. Pius vvoulde not yeeld there-vnto, the king calleth togither the Estates of his kingdome, and protesteth that he would liue & die in those Compacts, & so did also the Nobles which were Hussits. This was done at Prage in the yeare 1462. This resolutenesse of his, caused that Pope to tolerate many things in him, but Paul. 2. who succeeded

in that See of Rome, did excommunicate that king, and set vp a Croisado against him. Also he gaue to Matthias the king of Hungary, the title of king of Bohemia. Apud Platin. Onuphrius in the life of Paulus 2, saith that the Pope did excommunicate him, & depriue him of his kingdome. Indeed for seaven years this George and Mathias did warre for it, and Mathias got from him Moravia and Silesia, and a good part of the kingdome of Bohemia. Vratislavia also and some other Provinces and citties, did put themselues in subiection of Mathias. Yet did not George deale hardly with the Papists which were at Prage, but in his greatest extremity, did vse both the advise and aide of many Nobles of the Popish beleefe. At length after the continuance of warre for seaven years, Cochl. lib. 12. Mathias cōcludeth a peace with king George, both against the will of the Pope and the Emperour. And then this king was cō
                  tent, to aske of the Pope an absolution from the excommunication, some Princes being mediatours for him in that respect. But before the Agents could returne from Rome, the king died in the yeare of our Lord, 1471. By this story it is manifest, that both noble and learned of high account, were of that Christian beleefe, which Iohn Hus taught, and vvere contented to adventure all things which they had in the world, for the maintenance of the same.
               21 Perhaps here it may be asked; but how shall we know that Iohn Hus and his followers, did embrace that Religion which is now professed in England? We finde in Aeneas Sylvius some opinions of theirs, which peradventure will scant be reputed currant among all English Protestantes. He rehearseth these fowre of theirs, Histor. Bohem. ca. 50. 
                  That they would receiue the Sacrament in both kindes; that Civill dominion is inhibited to Cleargy men: that preaching of the vvords was to bee permitted to all men: that publike crimes are in no sort to bee tolerated. I answere, truth it is that he there mentioneth onely those, & whither he relateth them truely or no, it may be doubted, as anon I shall shewe, by laying open the custome of the enimies of the Gospell, in mis-reporting their doctrine. But elsewhere he delivereth other opinions of theirs, as Epist. 130. 
                  against the Supremacie of the Pope, against Purgatorie, against Invocation of Saints, and such like matters. If wee returne to Cochleus who was best acquainted

with their matters, wee shall finde much more. As thus, Cochl. Hist. lib. 1. Hus translated all the bookes of Canonicall Scripture into the Bohemian tongue, & the people did most diligently read them. They would haue the holy Scripture, to bee the only iudge in matters of Controversie. They held that al Bishops and Priests, are the successours of the Apostles. That not the Pope but Christ is the head of the Church, neither are the Cardinals the body, but all that beleeue in Christ. That the Pope is not a member of the Church, but of the Devill and his Synagoge. That one Pope was a womā. Yea Hus did preach, that the Pope is an abomination, and Antichrist. Also Lib. 2. he called the Generall Councel at Cō
                  stance, the Synagoge of Sathan. Another of his Articles was, Lib. 3. 
                  The Pope is the beast in the Apocalyps. His scholers after his death, broke downe the Lib. 4. Images in Churches and Monasteries. Yea Zisca did cast downe all the Lib. 5. Churches, which were dedicated to the Virgin Mary, or to any Saint, as if it were lawfull to build a Church, onely to almighty God. In his time the Professours began to be distinguished into two companies. The one of them did not so much dissent from the Pope, as the other. Those which in fewer matters differed from the Bishop of Rome, retained stil the name of Hussites; they which disagreed in more, were called Thaborites, of Thabor the Citty which Zisca built for them. And these were the greater number and the stronger. There is in Cochleus, a Professio fidei antiquae, &c. Confession of faith by one Iohannes de Pr

                  There should not be multiplyed, saith he, such variety of Images and pictures in the Churches. There should not be so many holy-daies. There should not so many new Saints be Canonized. Apocryphall writings should not be read in the Churches on holy-daies.

                     umerositie and variety of Religious persons is not expediēt. There are so many orders of begging Friers, that their state is burdensome to men, hurtfull to hospitals and to the poore. Few doe now studie 'Divinity for the abuse of the Church of Rome, which hath despised Divines. All now turne to the Lawe and to Artes of gaine. He saith, that it was then a proverbe, The Church is come to that estate, that it is not worthy to be ruled but by Reprobats. He hath very much more, and in the end concludeth, that Cap. 6. 
                  As there were seaven thousand, who had not bowed to Baal, so it is to he hoped, that there be some which desire the reformation of the Church. Imagin whither this Cardinall, if he had founde some company to haue ioyned with him, would not haue said much more. About that time lived Leonardus Aretinus, whose little booke In hypocritas libellus. 
                  Against Hypocrites, is worth the reading. So is the Oratio ad cleium Coloniensem. Oration of Antonius Cornelius Lynnichanus, laying open the lewde lubricity of Priests in his daies. So doth he detect many abuses and errours, who wrote the Decē gravamina Ger maniae. 
                  Tenne Grievances of Germany: but those who compiled the hundred Grievances of the Germaine Nation, doe discover many more. Finally he who list to see farther, that God even in those dead daies, had diverse servants, who by more then a glimce did see the truth, & desired yet more plentifully to be instructed in Religion, let him read the Lib. 19. 
                  Catalogus testium veritatis lately set out, and there hee shall finde divers whom I haue not named.
               24 By this time I trust it is manifest, how false a slaunder that of the Papists is, that before the daies of Martin Luther there was never any man of our Religiō. Till the time of the Councel of Constance, this case is cleared. And beyond that, it is as easie to shew, that Iohn Hus and Hierome of Prage, had their immediate antecessours in witnessing the faith of Christ. For they vvere instructed and much helped, by the bookes of Iohn VViclef an English man, and therefore saith Platina, as In Ioh. 24. 
                  sectatours of Wiclef, they were condemned in the Councell of Constance. Aeneas

Sylvius sheweth the means how those Bohemians came to know the doctrine of Wiclef; he saith thus: Histo Bohem ca. 35. 
                  He who first raised vp the opinions of the Hussites, had them from Oxford, carying thence into Bohemia Wiclefs bookes De Realibus Vniversalibus. Cochleus who by his good will would bee taken for a vehement defender of Popery, giveth yet a larger testimony. For he saith Histor. de Hussitis, li. 1. that as a Bohemian brought first into Bohemia Wiclef▪ booke De Realibus Vniversalibus, so there was afterward one P
                        •
                     ter Paine a scholer of Wiclefs, who after the death of his Maister, came also into Bohemia, and brought with him Wiclefs bookes, which were in quantitie as great at Saint Austens workes. 
                  Ibidem. Many of these bookes did Hus afterward translate into their mother tongue. In plaine tearmes after this, the Authour delivereth it, that Lib. 2. 
                  the Hussites and Thaborites were branches of Wiclef. And in the same booke, Hus did commit spirituall fornication with many strangers, with the Wiclefists, the Dulcinists, &c. And in the next he avoucheth, that Lib. 3. 
                  Hus and Hierome tooke their heresies from Wiclef. And once againe he tearmeth the Protestant Germanes Lib. 6. 
                  new Wiclefists. What an opinion of this man Iohn Hus had, may be fully seene by that wish of his, wherin hee praied Lib. 2. 
                  that hee might there bee, where the soule of Wiclef was. Now what VViclef did teach, may be easily gathered, if by nothing else, yet by the deadly hatred which the Romanists did cary toward him. The Session. 8. Councell of Constance did define him to be an Heretike, long after his death, and commaunded that his bones should be taken vp and burnt. Also Cochl. li. 1. Pope Iohn the 23. in a Generall Councel at Rome, did before that time condemne him for an heretike, which the Hussites did but laugh at. But no man had a harder conceipt of him then Cochleus, who sticketh not to affirme that Lib. 2. 
                  he thinketh the torments of Wiclef are greater in hell, then those of Iudas or Nero. If God Almighty had no better opinion of him, the man were in an ill case. But the best is, this cholerike Criticke is not the Iudge of all the world. He was angry be

Adversaries. And of these, long agone there were no smal company. For as Du 
                  Hist. li. 12. 
                  Haillan in the life of Philip the 3. King of Fraunce speaketh, being driven from Lyons in Fraunce, they withdrew themselues into Lombardy, where they so multiplied, that their doctrine began to spread through Italy, and came as farre as Sicely. As the same Authour Lib. 9. writeth, Philippus Augustus came to his kingdome, Anno 1180. which is nowe more then foure hundred yeares since. And in his time it was, that the Albingenses did so increase in Fraunce, that the Pope and Princes adioyning were afraide of their number. He who readeth the story of them shall see, that they are reported to haue held many grosse, wicked and absurde opinions mingled with their true doctrine. But Du. Haillan the best and most iudicious Chronicler of Fraunce, and no partiall witnesse in our behalfe (since his profession touching religion was such, that he was imployed to write that story, by K. Henrie the thirde) had not so little wit, but that he perceived those imputations to be laid on them in odium, and of purpose to procure their defamation. See how wisely he speaketh truth and his conscience, and yet so coucheth it, that his felows might not iustly be offended at his words. Lib. 10. 
                  Although saith he, these Albingenses had evill opinions, yet so it is that these did not stir vp the 
                        〈◊〉
                      of the Pope and of great Princes against them so much, as their libertie of speech did, vvherewith they vsed to blame the vices

                      dissolutenesse of the said Princes and of the Cleargy, yea to taxe the vices and actions of the Popes. This was the principall point which brought them into vniversall hatred, and which charged them with more evill opinions then they had. Now first that they were not men infamous, either for their vile opinions or filthy conversation, and secondly that they were not onely base and poore people, it is evident by this, that so many noble and worthy men tooke parte with them, yea to the adventuring of their liues, in their company and for then behalfe, as the Ibidem. Counties or Earles of Tholouse, of Cominges, of Bigerre, of Car
                        •…
                     , yea the King of Arragon. And when Raimund this Earle of Tholouse was for his beleefe excommunicated by the Pope, and a Croisado was proclaimed against him, and the Albingenses, as if they had beene Saracens or Infidels, not onely the Counties of Foix & Cominges came with all their

strength to assist Raimund, but Alphonsus the king of Arragon came in his owne person to his succour, as beeing his kins-man and his friend. And when all these were mett togither, the report is saith Du Haillan, that the armie of these heretikes, did consist of about one hundred thousand fighting men. These things being thus discovered by men of your owne part, be ashamed you Papistes and blush, to spread among your simple and credulous followers, that never men did as we do, nor beleeved as we beleeue, before Luthers time, and al Christendome formerly liked of the Papistical doctrine and proceedings. But because you shall yet heare one testimony farther, touching these Albingenses and Waldenses, how honest and truely religious they were, I will cite what one Reinerius, a man who did hate them and was as it is supposed, an Inquisit or against them, did report concerning them, now three hundred yeares agone, or there about. Thus then among much other matter he saith of them, Catal test. verit. lib. 15. 
                  There were many sects of heretikes long agone, among all which sects that are or were, there is not one more pernicious to the Church of God, then that of the Poore men of Lyons, for three causes. First because it is of longer continuance. Some say that it hath endured from the time of Sylvester. Other say, that from the time of the Apostles. The second is because it is more generall. For there is almost no land in which this sect doth not creepe. The thirde, that whereas all other by the imm

                     ity of their Blasphemies against God, do make men abhorte them, this of the Lyonists having a great shew of godlinesse, because they doe liue iustly before men, and do beleeue all things well of God, and all the Articles which are contained in the Creede; only the Church of Rome they doe blaspheame and hate: which the multitude is easie to beleeue, and as Sampsoni Foxes had their faces severall waies, but their tayles tyed one to the other, so heretikes are diverse in sects among themselves, but in the impugning of the Church they are vnited. There can hardly be found a more honorable testimony, out of the mouth or penne of a bitter and bloudy adversary, as he was who wrote this, and much more, concerning those good servountes of God.

               31 And in this respect our setled and resolved iudgement is, that when it is asked, where our Church in former ages was, we may besides that which formerly hath beene answered, truely say, that it was in England, in France, in Spaine, in Italy, yea in Rome it selfe. Spiritus vbi vult spirat. The holy Ghost breatheth Ioh. 3. 8. where it pleaseth. For who cannot conceiue by the writings of many in former ages, or by such touches as other doe giue concerning them, that diverse who lived nearest the whore of Babylon, did most detest her abomination, & finding that the weakenesse and impurity of her doctrine, could not truely satisfie the hungry & thirsty soule, did according to that knowledge which Christ out of his word reveiled to thē, seeke some meanes which was not ordinarily professed in that time. And if it be asked who they were, and how could they lie hid from the world, it may truly bee answered, that their case was like the case of them in the daies of 1. Reg. 19. 18. Elias, who were not known to that State, which would haue persecuted them. Now why should not we thinke, but as God had his secret and invisible company at that time, in that most idolatrous country, so in the time of the deepest darknesse, he had those who saw light this Christian children among Antichrists broode: such as embraced true religion, among the superstitious?

Our Popish lads would gladly shut al these out of Christs fold, because they acknowledged not the Bishop of Rome, for their vniversall Pastour: but we should do wrong to Almighty God, to pinne his iudgment vpon the Popes sleeue, and to offer to pull from him so many ample Churches, whereas charity and common sence might put vs in minde, that hee might there haue thousandes throughout all ages. Looke to these places yee Papists, and imagine that if there had been none but these, yet the wordes of the Scripture, which in generality speake of a spowse had beene true, and Christ had there had his body on earth, and the Church had not beene vtterly extinguished, if neither we nor the Synagoge of Rome had beene extant.
               32 But in as much as it cannot be denied, but that the Prophecies concerning Antichrist doe most touch the Westerne world, Apoc. 17. 18.

mens houses, and to destroy what was thought fit by them to be destroyed.

in their Confess. Waldensiu. Confession they have it directly, Of these criminations vvhereof vvee are blamed oftentimes, vvee are nothing at all guiltie. The Pope and his Chapleins were fell and furious against them, because they did bite so neere, and therefore to disgrace them, both in present and to posteritie, they helde it fit that by speech, preaching and writing, it should be divulgated, that they taught monstrous blasphemies, that by that meanes the credulous people might be preiudicate, and so not onely frighted from harkening to them, but be much the readier to ioyne in the prosecutiō of thē to prison & to death.

There is no Papist vvho can truely and vvithout calumniating them, or sayning thinges vpon them, demonstrate that in causes vvhich touch the substance of

And what man religiouslie affected will suspect, but that although Saint Cyprian, and the other Affricane Bishops aslembled in a Concil. Carthag. in Cypriā. oper. Councel, did, concerning the new baptizing of those who were already baptized by Heretikes, determine cleane contrarie to Cornelius, & the rest of the Italian Bishops, yet they should not be of the same faith in generall, and of the same holy Church, whereof Cornelius was? Saint Austen can thus write concerning Cyprian:

                  Whereas that holy man Cyprian, (thinking otherwise of Baptisme, then the matter was, vvhich was afterward handled, and with most diligent consideration established) did remaine in the Catholike vnity; both by the plentifulnesse of his charitie a recompence was made, and by the sickle of his suffering there vvas a purging.

               IF you would, you might quickly know, that names are given for distinction sake, & whē those persons to whom the names belong, are to bee distinguished from a generall sort, they haue names more generall: but when from a speciall comprehended in their own generall, they are to haue appellations more special.

In Greece if a man had beene disposed to put a difference betweene one that was learned, and the vulgar vnlearned people, it had been a good note of distinction to say, he is a Philosopher. But when the question grew betweene several Sects & their opinions, then for more particular difference, it was not enough to say that Diogenes was a Philosopher, but he was a Cynick: such a one was an Epicurean, another a Peripa
                     •…
                  eticke, this an Academike, that a Platonicke. In some sence it is enough to say, that in the yeare 1588, her Maiesty of England had against the Spaniard a campe of so many thousand English, resolute mē, religious, and well appointed: but when there is question of particulars in that campe, then the Oxford-sheere men had those Captaines, the Wilt-shire men these, and their colours were several. So if in India or Asia, the opposition must be betweene the Infidels or Mahumetans on the one side, and the servants of Christ, of what sort soever they be, on the other side, it is enough to say in generall, thus or thus do the Christians: But if there be occasion to particularize any thing, then the Christians in Spaine, or those in Germany are thus and thus affected. VVhen speech is of the doctrine of Mahomet opposed to Christianity, the name Mahumetane will comprehend the Persian and his subiects, the Turke and his vassals, the kings of Argier, Tunis and Marocco, and all that are vnder them. But when we talke of the difference in Mahomets profession, betweene the Turke and the Persian, vvhich hath on either party cost much bloud, we say the Persian thus holdeth: the Turke beleeveth thus. Wheresoever in Christendome there is disagreemēt in Religiō, some holding for the Pope and some other against him, there the name Papist is frequent: & this is not only in Germany, but God be praysed for it, in Norway, and Sweden, and Denmarke, in Polonia, in Fraunce, England, Scotland, the Low Countryes, & whersoever else the Gospell is knowne either openly or secretly. Yea in Italy, Spaine and Sicily not only the name of Papistes, but the whole doctrine of Popery woulde quickely come in question, were it not for your bloudy Inquisition, or cruell massacring otherwise, of such as bend not that way. And yet they be not able to extirpate Gods truth. As for the Greekes they loue you not, neither like of your

Religion; and Asia, Africa and the Indies knowe very little of our differences in Profession, vnlesse it bee by the Christians themselves, and that onely heere and there, as at Aleppo peradventure or some other Marte towne; except you vvill name a fewe creekes or corners of Africa, and the East Indies, where the Portingales have incroched, or those partes of the VVest Indies, where the Spaniards have devoured vp, almost all the olde inhabitants, and planted themselues: and to aske of these Portingales and Spaniards whether they bee ought but Catholikes, is not to aske a mans felow, but to aske a mans selfe, whether he be a theefe or no? But surely the Infidels, or Turkes, or Greekes do neither call you nor know you by that name. And if Luther were the first who gave you that title of Papiste, which pleaseth you so much, you are behoulding to him for fitting you so right: not that you might not lustly have bin so called before. But hee having occasion to display your impiety to the full, and God inableing him with learning and knowledge, as also with spirit and wit for that purpose, hee gave you a name most sutable to your nature, which is the truest vse of appellations and names. It very well agreeth with you: for if Christians be those who harken vnto Christ, and are directed by him, you may well be Papists, who depend on the onely voice and direction of the Pope.

               4. THat Luther & Calvin were Heretikes, you Pseudo-Catholikes may say, but you shal never be able to prove it. They taught Gods truth, and if ever any would have shewed them out of the Scripture, that they had erred, such was their mind, they would have reformed it. As for the name of Lutherans & Calvinists, to be desired or embraced by vs, we vtterly disclaime it; not that wee are ashamed to bee of the same faith which these worthy servants of God did teach, touching the foundation of Religion; but because we take our name from the Sonne of God, of whom wee are called Act. 11. 26. 
                  Christians. This is the name wherein all of vs doe reioyce, at all times and in all places, without any exception or circumstance of dependance: but the appellation of Lutherans, and Calvinists, or Zuinglians, or any such like, you in your hatred towards vs do set vpon vs. And by your rule of Chrysostome before mentioned, they might without impiety be received of vs in some sence, since Zuinglius and Luther and Calvine, had a great stroke in the governement of those particular Churches where they-lived, and were much honoured of the Congregations which were neere vnto them. As for the Nestorians, we at knowledge that they had their title of the Hererike Nestorius, and the Pelagians of Pelagius, yea if you will also, the Marcionites of Marcion, the Arrians of Arius, according to that of Chrysostome: 
                  Homil 33. in Acta. 
                  Are vvee cut from the Church? have vvee Captaine. Heretikes? have vvee our name from men? have wee any leader, as Marcion is to one, and Manicheus to another, and Arius to a third, & to a fourth another beginner of Heresie? But whereas you give down a general rule, that Heretikes have ever takē their names of some one who began that Heresy, we pittie you much & fairely demiūde of you, frō what one did the August. de Haeres ad Quod vultd.

               5 That Luther should be afraide of the word Catholike, so without reason vsurped by you, or arrogated to your selues, is a conceit very childish. He who dreaded not to encounter your Popes triple Crowne, to baite his Buls, to batter his Purgatory, to lay siege to Babylon it selfe, was never so white-liverd, as to feare the Moone shining in the water. Therefore when you shall cite v

                   some authentical warrant, that he changed I beleeue the Catholike Church, into I beleeue the Christian Church, we will giue credite vnto you. But when you bring vs Master Bristow in the first of his Motiues, and he giveth vs no testimony of his speech, neither quoteth any place for it, we thinke that we may safely returne it to the shop, in which it was first forged. Notwithstanding we obserue the manner of your proceeding, you Papistes taking vp things by tradition, or one from another, without ground, to deface any man of rare note among vs. You in your margent quote Bristow, and there vpon I turning to the place in him, finde the same accusation, but no place or tract specified, only Luther is put in the margent and nothing else. Your late fabler vpon Quinti Evangelij. cap. 1.

                     , serveth vs in this sort, saving that he ascribeth that to vs all, which his fellows limit onely to Luther. Being to speak of the Article in the Creede, I beleeve the holy Catholike Church, the Communion of Saints, he sub-ioyneth thervpon, This Article all the Pretestants in generall, as farre as in them is, doe oppugne. First because they have thrust out of the Creede, the word (Catholike,) & in steede thereof haue put the word (Christian,) as is Catholikes were no Christians. This did Luther in the Creede in Dutch, because the word Catholike is a sta
                        •…
                      in the 
                        〈◊〉
                      of the Protestantes. It is worth the marking, that first hee chargeth vs all with it, secondly the instaunce is given in Luther alone, and thirdly no proofe is made of that, no not so much as out of Giffords Calvino-Turcismus, out of which being as slaunderous a worke as his owne, this excellent Authour doeth most commonly take his confirmations. Thus if one Papist will bee so wicked, as to devise something which was never spoken, or to pervert that to ill purpose which was well spoken, his fellowes will presently applaude it as a truth, and publish it one after another,

as if it were as certaine as the Gospell. Now for this of Luther, if there had beene any such matter, which but in probability could haue beene fastened vpon him, would that sweete fellow Cochleus who pursueth him step by step, haue forgotten it? Or would he not aswell haue remembred him for the Creede, as he did for the Pater-Noster, although that also was but the seeking of a knot in a rush. For it is a complaint made by An. 1522. in actis Lutheri. Cochleus against Luther, that in his translation of the New Testament, he did not keepe the set words of the Lordes prayer formerly vsed, but for Pater noster quies in coelis, he put it, Noster pater in coelo, and for, Sanctificetur nomen tuum, he translated it as if it were, tuum nomen sit sanctum, & yet you must vnderstand that it was into Dutch that he turned it, and not into Latin, where in all likelyhoode it was as a great fault to put Noster before Pater, as it is in English to say Our Father, and not rather Father ours, or Father of vs. Doe you not want matter of waight to obiect, when you spende your times in such frivolous exceptions? And even of this sort is the next stout reason which followeth. For as Luther was afraide of the worde Catholike, so are wee of Heretike, that is to say, never a whit: for we know that there be Heretikes, as Arrians, Anabaptists and many more: and that the Romanists are as great in Heresie as any, in as much as they vary from truth in many, & those capitall and very dangerous pointes. But if you had not trusted your maister Bristow, from whom you haue Motiv. 2. stolne this, but looked your selfe into our bookes, you should haue seene that Master Beza had translated that

                      hominem; and so Tremelius out of the Syriake, A viro haretico. And the ordinary English hath it, even as the Rhemists put it, without varying a title in the whole verse, A mā that is an heretike after the first and second admonition avoide, & another English, Reiect him that is an heretike after once or twise admonition. And I thinke it be not to be found, but where 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is in the Greeke, we put it Act. 24. 14. 1. Cor. 11. 19. Gal. 5. 20. 2. Pet. 2. 1. 
                  heresie. And if at any time there hath beene put for an heretike, an author of sectes, it hath beene to no other purpose, but to expresse the nature of the word, & to make it plaine to the people, what is meant by an heretike, that is an inventor or a follower of some strange sector opinion in Religion,

to which peculiar vse, the Ecclesiastical writers haue applyed 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   from a more generall vnderstanding amongst all the olde Grecians. Here it may be noted once againe, that you Papists make no conscience, in charging vs with any thing whatsoever, that maketh for your purpose. For if it bee in our bookes as cleere as the Sunne to the contrary, yet your people must not looke into our writings, so to disproue your falshoode: that is inhibited vnto them. Whereby it appeareth, that you not only do your best, to send your ghostly children to hell; but the glory of it is, they must goe thither blindfolded. At this b

                  AS for their owne name, vvhereby they tearme themselues Protestantes, (which name they take from certaine Lutherans in Germany, who first named themselues so, differing and dis-agreeing altogither from the Protestants in doctrine) it is newe, and never hearde of before in the world, and of the same quality and condition, that the name, Zwinglians, is of.

               I tolde you before, that absolutely we challendge no name but Christians, which is full out as ancient as the time of the Act. 11 26. Apostles; but Zwinglians you in your malice tearme vs, as also Protestants with a contempt. Yet this latter appellation was not begunne by you, but arose vpon an accident at Spires in Germany. There in a An. 1529. Diet the Duke Electour of Saxony, the Marques of Brandeburge, the Lantgraue and some other Princes, and Citties of the Empire, did make solemnely in writing a Sleidan. Hist lib. 6.

wherevpon for distinction sake, in cōmon speech the name of Protestants, which is the Prosters, was given vnto thē. By your former rule this cannot be an evill name, since it is not taken frō any man, or from the author of a sect, but it arose from an action, there first thought necessary to be done with those circūstances: Whence it may be no marveile, if that title arising from that action, were never heard of in that meaning before. And since that time, those who are ready to vse the like Protestation vpon the like cause, or doe approue of that their wise and Christian course there, do not refuse to be called as they were, in some sense, not simply; for some respects, not absolutely; but most of all for difference sake from you, against whō the Protestation is to be made. Yea and custome having so prevailed, we do in writing & speaking promiscuously vse the word Protestants, as we do Religiosi, or Reformata Religionis homines, or Evāgelici, not boasting in these titles, as you doe to be called Papists, but only admitting of thē for customes sake, & to make a distinction between vs & you, both tearming our selues Christians. Now that we altogither disagree in doctrine frō the Protestants in Germany, is not so much ignorāce in you to avouch, as malice. For you know & sēsibly feele it, that we right-wel agree with thē & they with vs, in displaying of Antichrist, his Indulgēces, his Pilgrimages, his Orders of Religiōs, in oppugning the Tridentine Councell which is the new-erected Capitol of Popery, in that excellēt Article of Iustificatiō by faith only, and in breefe in all matters of moment, saving the point of Consubstantiation in the Eucharist, which yet also thousands in Germany doe deny, and whereof I shal haue occasion to speake farther Ration.

But the hatred which you do equally beare, vn to thē & vnto vs for the same respects, doth shew that we ioine in serving the same Christ, & discovering the same Antichrist. Your cōclusiō thē which you draw out of S. Hierome, maketh nothing against vs; nether doth ought that you intimate out of In. Martyr or Chrysost. They speake of heretiks who take both their name & doctrine frō men alone, & nothing at all from God: whereas first we are Patients and not Agentes, when the name of any man is set vpon vs, & this is not by our selues delighted in. And secondlye our doctrine is not from any creature, but onlye from Iesus

Christ and his word, to whom we cleave and sticke as to a rocke, and regard none who bringeth any thinge contrarie therevnto. And so for this boute I leave D. Hill; putting him notwithstanding in minde, that he is so studious a sectatour, and so faithfull a scholer of M Bristow, that without varying a letter he citeth the place of Hierome, word for word as his maister doth, when Montenses and Campitas, might for his credit sake, and to have had a little variety, beene as well translated Hill-men, or Field-persons, as after that sorte that he doth put them. But there Hierome, as it is most probable, alludeth to the Montanists, whom with a kinde of ierke he calleth not Montanists, but Montenses, & for their loose life rather Campitas, as being fitter to tumble in the fields, then to shew themselves on the mountaines, which also is collected by a learned Marius Victor. in Annotat. super Hieronim. man vpon that place.
               7 HOwsoever some other simple flourishes are here made by M.

                  Apoc. 3. 9. 
                  of Satā, did call thēselves Iewes and were not, but did lye. And among the Christians there have bin men desirous of names, which were not fit for thē, or else the Apostle would not have said, 1. Cor. 5. 11, 
                  If any that is called a brother, bee a fornicatour, or covetous, or an Idolater, or a railer, or a drūkard, or an extortioner, with such a one eate not. The name of a brother in Christianity is much: as presupposing to have God a father to him, who is indeede the father of all the faithfull: & yet there bee brethren in name, who are farre inough from God & goodnes. Hist Eccl. 3. 18. 
                  Evil names, as we find in Theodoret, being set on good men do nothing obscure them; The Christians were not hurte, when Iulian in a scorne to our Saviour Iesus, alwaies tearmed them Galileans: and if Socrates, saith Theodoret, had beene called Critias, or Pythagoras Phalaris, or faire Nireus foule Thersites, it had nothing impayred their true reputatiō. So it is in applying good titles to bad persons: they are not for the same in any more estimatiō, with such as be of vnderstāding. Whē theeves by a common phrase are tearmed good-fellows, & light huswives are called honest women, neither the one nor the other are the honester for that nominatiō. Those who are ordinarily called by the name of Iesuits, do little that may savor of the spi rit of Iesus; vnles to seduce youth, to inveigle & beguile the wealthy, to play al trickes of Machiavel, to cōspire the death of Princes, to plot how to set kingdomes in cōbustiō, & cūningly to sow secret discord & sedition, be the imitatiō of our blessed Redeemer; which no man but one inspired by the Devil may acknowledge. What mā of learning is ignorāt, that the Saracens are descended frō

of bastardy by Ismael, and of basenes by Hagar, who was but a bond-woman, they take Sozom. Eccl. Hist. 6. 38. to thē the name of Saracens, as if they were derived from Sara the right wife of Abraham. Neither can there ought bee saide, why the Romanists should bee the true Church, because they are called Catholikes, but the same may be said for these Mahumetās, why they should be the sons of the free womā, & not of the bond. For the name is most ancient, and they are every where knowne by it, & if Saracēs be but spoken, ech-one that hath ever heard of thē, vnderstādeth that they and they alone, are meāt by it, & in Asia & Europe & Africa, yea in America also, this by custome rūneth currāt without cōtrolemēt, & yet wee know that it is neither so nor so.

But a great number also in France & Italy, & other Popish parts of Christendome, would for themselves forbid those banes.

                  is not any where but in the Catholike discipline or instruction; & vnto which sence, vse & ordinary custome hath now brought the word? Even so they are most farre from it. For while they strive about the name, they have lost the thing: they keepe the shel, but have parted with the kernel: while they lay hould on the Candle-sticke, some other is runne away with the light. Their case is like that of the kings souldiours of Socrat. l. 7. 20. Persia, who keeping the name of

Let thē lay aside these verbal & titulary gloses, & make plaine out of the Scripture, that they maintaine the same faith, which Christ and his Apostles taught, & then they do somewhat. But they are fallen from it, yea from the sound profession, which was in the daies of the Fathers & Doctors of the Primitive Church, & therfore that which was true of their times, is not communicable now to Popery. No not that of Saint Austen, whervpon they have a maine desire to fastē, The

                  Christian Religiō is to be held by vs, & the cōmunion of that Church which is Catholike, and is named Catholike not onely of her owne friends, but also of all her enimies. For wil or nil the very Heretikes, & favourers of schismes, when they speake not with their owne but with strangers, they cal the Catholik church nothing els but the Catholike church. For they cannot be vnderstood, vnlesse they distinguish her by that name, wherby she is called of al the world. This was spoken of the whole nū
                  ber of Christians in the world, which embraced the right faith, not of the Romane Church onely. And those who nowe are devoted vnto Rome, doe as much differ from the puritie and integrity of their olde predecessours, as Babylon doth differ from

Sion. Then in oppositiō to Heretikes, which were but in corners and fewe places, the faith which either Rome or any right Christian citty helde, might be called Catholike; but nowe that which the Pope maintaineth, may it selfe bee reckoned no better then Hereticall perfidiousnes, which the farther it is spred, the worse it is with Gods flocke.
               9 To set them therfore straight, by bringing thē from such vizards & painted shewes to the matter, it is not any name wherevnto men are directed, for finding out the truth, but Ioh. 5. 39. 
                  Search the Scriptures, saith Christ, for in them you thinke to have eternall life, and they are they which testifie of mee. And as they testifie of Christ, so do they also of his Spouse, as we find in diverse of the ancient Fathers. Cyprian saith, De Lapsis.

                  A good purpose, and the beleeving of right opinions, doth make a soul to be in the house of the Church. But St. Chrysostome or the Auctor of the Imperfect worke vpon St. Matthew, doth yet speake more plainely: Homil. 49. 
                  He who will know what is (or which is) the true Church of Christ, whēce should he know it but only by the Scriptures? The Lord therfore knowing that in the last daies there vvould bee so great confusion of things, doth therfore command, that the Christians which are in Christianity, being willing to receive the firmenes of a true faith, should flie to no other thing but to the Scriptures. Otherwise if they looke to other things, they shall be scandalized and perish, not vnderstanding vvhich is the true Church. By which our Romanists may see, that it is not a naked name, nor any other matter of all that vncertaine rabble, which the writer of this Pamphlet heereafter subioyneth, that can bee our direction, which is the Church, or where is the truth, but only the holy Scriptures. And as Chrysostome hath, Homil. 33. in Act. 
                  If any agree to thē, he is a Christian: if any fight against them hee is farre from this rule. The word of the Lord is the sure foundation, & he who buildeth on any thing besides this, setteth his house but vpon the Mat. 7. 26. sand, and while he thinketh that he standeth for the Faith, and for the Church, he is enemie to both; as those were to whom Leo sometimes Bishop of Rome wrote thus. Leo Epist. 83 ad Episcopos Palestinos. 
                  you thinke that you deale for the faith, and you goe against the faith. You are armed in the name of the Church, and you fight aganist the Church. Let him who will farther

You pretend that, notwithstāding such variety of wits, manners, languages, places & matters to be beleeved, (you should haue put the sixth also, as Bristow. Motiv. 27. your Mr. doth, such difference of opinions amongst learned mē, which you did leaue out, least you should insinuate to any, but a very favourable Reader, a cōtradictiō to your own position) such vnity hath beene kept, as that in faith & doctrine, he who liveth in the most Westerne coūtries of the old inhabited world, hath not dissēted frō him, that resideth in those of the East. where by the way you faile a litle in your Geography, as wel as in your Divinity: for it is much doubted of Ireland, but certainly known, that Englād is not so far to the West as Gallitia, or Portingale: but in Africa, the partes about Marocco doe without controversie exceede them all Put this therefore in your negligences. But all Papists in the worlde haue one faith, one beleefe, one Service, one number of
                  
                  Sacraments, one Obedience, one Iudgement in all, and the peace of their mindes is such through their vniformity that they haue all one hearte and one soule. What their sympathy of affection in other matters besides Religion is, if we could not learne by Guicciard lib. 9. Pope Iulius the second, in person making warre against Mirādula, & the Frēch, then also lying in the field when all was covered with snowe: or by Natal. Comes Hist. l. 9 King Philip the second of Spaine, most eagerly watring by his Generall the Duke of Alva, against Pope Paulus the fourth himselfe: or by the Conestag. lib. 7. Histo. Spaniards prosecutiō against Don Antonio and his Portingales: or by the much loue, which Henry the third King of Fraunce with the Duke of Espernon, did beare to the Guize and the Leaguers, & they to them; or by the long continued The estate of English fugitiues. factions betweene our discōtented English Fugitives beyond the seas; yet our Romanists at home would lately teach vs; where the Iesuits and the Arch. Priest with his adherents on the one side, and divers of the Seculars on the other side, haue exercised such contentions, and almost deadly fewde each against other, that all England and a great parte of Europe hath rung of the same; yea the Pope himselfe and his Cardinals are no straungers therevnto. And by your leaue, the rest of the Papists being either at liberty, or restrained, throughout this kingdome, haue not beene all of one heart, one obedience, one iudgement aboute these businesses; but there hath beene not only dislike, but intestine hatred also in some of them, against the blabbing Priests, and the party opposite to the Iesuites.

Iesuits are charged to giue toleration to come to the Protestants Churches, and the Seculars do withstand it? When the Iesuits vphold the Bul of Pope Pius the 5. & the Seculars doe question it? When the Iesuites mainetaine, that the Excommunication Consistorially given against her late Maiesty, is a right and Papall sentence: but the Seminarians & their abetters, avouch it to bee a matter of fact, and not of faith, and therefore the Pope may there in erre. And is there one beleefe when you cānot doctrinally agree, whither the Pope or the Generall Councell be the greater? When not long since Pigh. Eccles. Hier. lib. 1. 2. Papists did mainetaine, that the authority of the Church was aboue the

Scriptures, but the Bellar. de Concil. lib. 2. 12. Iesuites now deny it; and the In Gal. 2. 2. Rhemistes as moderatours cannot well tell what to make of it, but in some sences rather bend to the prerogatiue of the Church? And as you haue reformed many other things in Popery, so is your service the same? When your Breviaries or Porteises are so much altered since the time of the Councell of Trent, and so many shamefull things put out, which if they were impious or idolatrous, your people before those daies were in a pretty pickle. As Georgius & Timotheus being more nasute then their predecessors, did purge their Socr. Eccles Hist. 7. 6. Arrianisme, and cleared it of many the blasphemies of Arius, retaining such as were more plausible: so Pius the 5. cleansed the Breviary of many absurdities, and helde only those things which he supposed were more defensible. Bellar de verbo Dei. lib. 2. 11. In your new Missals also many texts are altered, from that which was in the old. Your Legēdaries in former times were read in the midst of your Congregations, & accepted for good truth: yet now you reiect your ancient books, insomuch that Motiv. 5.

For first touching the Scriptures, we know that with them the Latin Vulgar Edition is only authenticall, and so the Session. 4. Councell of Trent hath defined it; whereas the Originals of the Hebrew and Greeke, which are the first and clearest fountaines, are but basely esteemed by many of them, insomuch that they Prolog ad Lector. ante li. 1.

What combats your Bishops, Councellours, and moderate sort of Protestants have to defend their Parlimentary Religion, and the Queenes Proceedings as they terme it, against Puritans, Brownists, & other such like good fellowes, that by shew of Scriptures impugne it, you cannot but knowe and see with your eyes. Neither can it bee answered, that the Sects heere rehearsed differ one from another onely in matters of small moment, for they differ and disagree in waighty points of our salvation; as might heere easily be declared, but that it would not benefite this mine intended brevity so to doe.

               8 WHen you have put on your spectacles to see, & have picked your eares to heare, you and all your confederates can neither iustly see nor heare (Gods name be blessed therfore) that either at this time, or at the divulging of this your treatise, there be or were any differences of opinion in England, concerning the faith. Our Preachers do not differ, or teach diverse doctrines in any of their Sermons. VVe have for our rule the olde and new Testament, & the Articul. Relig. in Synodo. 1562. Confession of our Church in the Articles of Religion, set out by the warrāt of the Scripture alone: and to these as to the Analogy of faith we do cleave, and there is no graduate in our Vniversities, and much lesse, Preachers and Pastours in our churches, but subscribe thervnto. And if heeretofore, there have bin some fewe Brownists mis-ledde, by a man who afterward was sory for his own over-sight, the name of them now (as I thinke) is not to bee heard of among vs. And such as you cal Puritans, did never differ frō the rest in any point of substance, but about circumstances and ceremonies, as cappe, surplesse and such like, and about the manner of Ecclesiasticall

And had not this beene: yet if your brevity (which is but a shuffling colour, to make shewe of some things which are not) had beene turned into one yeeres or seaven yeeres longity, you could not have shewed, that in substantiall points of faith there was variāce among vs. And therfore for that matter you do wel to do as you do, that is, put vp your pipes & make no more noise. Yet I cannot so leave you, but put you in mind cōcerning Protestants & Puritanes, that it is probable that the Controversies which then were; by your slie & secret cōveiances were the more forwarded; at the least you Romanistes did your best, by hypocrites and other your naughty instruments to cōtinue them. For the practise of your religion, being of late nothing else but mischievous policie, your Emissaries were instructed at their comming into England to sooth both sides, and to commend them, that so they might persist in their opinions. And heere I shall open to the vvorlde some thing of your cunning,

vvhich is not knowne to every body. There At Rhemes Anno 1579. are certaine instructions, vvhich, Doctour Allen in a longe continuated speech, (vvhich hee dictated to his auditours, and they in vvriting tooke it from his mouth) did bestovve on such Priests, as vvere then to bee sent from the Seminarie in Fraunce, into England. And these vvere to informe them, hovve they should deale vvith all sortes of people, to pervert them from their faith. Thus therefore hee advertiseth them, If you chaunce to deale vvith a Puritane, you must say vnto him, Truely brother for you, there is more hope then of these that be Protestants, because they for feare of the Prince and the lawe, are ready to say and beleeve any thing, and therfore me thinketh they be Atheistes: but for you there is more hope, being either hote or colde. If you deale vvith a Protestant, tell him there is more hope of him, then of such rash brained Puritanes, because they with Religion have put of all humanitie, and civilitie, vvith all other good māners. Who would not thinke that for mischievous devises, this head of Allens, was soone after worthy to be covered with a Cardinals hat? But by the leave of our Seculars, who strive to magnifie him, he did not learne this of Saint Peter, but rather of Sir Nicholas Machiavel, a man of their good acquaintance. Heere, with our Seminarie Preests, both Protestants and Puritanes were for a purpose honest men; I would that we had cause so to repute of th

And was not this the course which Asa did take, for the reforming 2. Chron. 15 9. of those errours, wherwith Gods service was intāgled, when assembling all Iudah and Beniamin to Ierusalem, hee did cause them by an othe of association, and as in way of a stronge covenant, to binde themselves to God, yea and that vnder the paine of death, to flie Idolatrie, and to embrace true piety and devotiō. The like might be saide of other Princes who were god ly. And these meetings no doubt being such assemblies as our Parliament is, or rather being some more generall matter, hee who should have termed their conclusions, a Parliamentary Religion, might have bin reputed no better thē a scoffing enimy. And so may you Doctor Hill be accounted, and Bristow in like sorte: but Persons over and aboue that, may have the name of a slaunderer, who can glose and invent any thing which may serve for his purpose, as that is that P. Martyr, and M. Bucer were indented with all to teach as the Parliament should decree, implying that whatsoever it had bin, they must have condescended vnto it. This lying Iesuite can shew no letter, no Acte of Record, no testimony of semblaunce of truth, to averre this his calumniation. But the matter indeed was, that the reformers of Religion heere, intending to level all by the line of Gods word, knew that those two worthy men were so affected in al their teachings; and therefore, as also for their admirable learning & iudgment, they made choise of them before all the great Clerkes which were in Europe. And that those who called them hither, were not deceived in them, the excellent monuments which they have lest in writing behinde them, doe testifie to the world.

But to answere you both togither, this maketh nothing against vs; for we ioyne in cōsent for all material points of the substāce of salvation, not only with our selves, but with all the faithfull and rightly beleeving, which have bin in the world, with the Patriarkes, the Prophets, the Apostles, the Fathers of the Primitive Church, and the Martyrs; neither can you, or the greatest Goliah of your side, ever proove the contrary.

This tale therefore of discord, do you tell to your bleare-eyed followers, who cannot discerne colours: All right beleevers are satisfied for this matter. But on the other side, the agreement which is among you, is but a conspiracie against Christs honour, even such a combination as was betweene Mat. 16. 57 Luk. 23. 12. 
                  Herode and Pilate, & Annas and Caiphas, the Scribes, Pharisees, Priests & people, to bring our blessed Saviour to the crosse. Your consent is not in God, nor in his sonne Iesus, but to robbe them both of their glory, & to bestowe it on your I doll at Rome.

Of these one was, that brute beasts doe not receive the very body of Christ, although it seemeth that they doe, when they devour the Hoste after consecration. And is it not to bee supposed that the Scholers of this great Clerk, did follow their Rabbi in maintaining the same assertions? And if you will looke there farther, you shall see that those Sorbonists were many times troubled, with refuting and censuring diverse doctrines, which were set abroach two or three hundred yeeres since, and that diverse times in the depth of Popery. That little Treatise alone will satifie any man that readeth it, that in this your assertion of wonderfull consent, you are wonderfully out. Should not a man thinke that one of your learning, had heard of Thomas Vias Caietanus once Cardinall of Rome, how deepe a scholer hee was, and howe many bookes hee wrote?

And it is almost as wonderfull, that any English Papist will lay his soule, vpon the credite of such fellowes as you are. And it is a peece of a marveile, whither you taking on you to be a Doctour without Divinity, haue read nothing about this businesse, or vnderstood nothing when you reade it, or forgot it since, or what you haue done with it.

Which when it cannot be denied, your answere must be that these are facts, and not matters of doctrine. Where I might call to your minde, the reversing of the Bible by Clement the 8. which is a matter containing in it the substaunce and foundation of all doctrine, but of that before.

was a great question, whether after the mariage of a couple, the one of them falling into heresie, it might be lawful for the other, to relinquish his or her yoke-fellow, and to mary

                  Innocentius the 3. and Celestinus the 3. gave contrary iudicial sentences in this cause, the one permitting to the innocent party to mary againe, the other quite forbidding it. It is not to be imagined but that in the darke time of Popery, many Kings and Nobles and inferiour persons in Fraunce, had Indulgences from diverse Popes, for their own soules, & for the soules of their friēds & parents; whereby if we will allow the Romane doctrine to be good, it must needs be, that according to the time granted in the Pardō, many a soare soule which had fryed in Purgatory flames, was set free by such favour, as the holy father who had the custody & dispensation of the treasure of the Church, had affoorded them, and then immediately they went to heaven. But when Philip the faire was King of Fraūce, he fell out with the Pope, & having his Clergy & whole Realme vnited to him, he disgraced that Roman Bishop, vilefied him, & exceedingly both abridged, abrogated his power in Fraūce: Pope Boniface the 8. who would cary no coales at any such meane mans hāds, as a King of Fraūce was, cōsistorily revoketh al the Du Haillā. Lib. 13. grants, immunities, Privileges, Indulgences, graces, & whatsoever any of his Predecessors had given to Fraunce or any french. On daunger of your life you must not make doubt, but this Boniface did well, and his sentence must stand. What he bindeth in earth, is bounde in heaven, and what he looseth is loose. Hence then ariseth a question, insinuated by Apolog. pro Herodot. cap. 40. 
                  Henry Stephanus, which I feare that all the Seminary of Doway will hardly be able to aunswere. Whether the Popes sentence mustnot stand good: or else whether the soules vvhich had escaped, and were flowen out vnto heaven, were immediately vpon the pronoūcing of that horrible sentence, to retire to Purgatory, frō whence they had come out, by a grace which was now frustrated. How poorely & how pitifully would these soules looke, whē they should so on the sodaine be doffed of their felicity, which they thought they had as sure as heaven & Angels could make it? This wold make shrewd speaking, in some other thē being in heaven, least also the soules of some other countries

should meete with such a bargaine. Thus you see, the Bishops of Rome do not ever say the same things, nor define after the same sorte. And although all these by mee named, be not the graund points of their doctrine, yet their will should not have bin wanting even there also, if it had bin for their advantage. They vvho would goe so farre, would have strained a string farther, if they had seene reason for it, But in sooth why should they vary from their mainest grounds? Popery was not so hastily built, that the high Priests of it, should in a wātonnes tumble any of it downe. And it is so concatenated, that destroy one part of it, & you ruinate a great deale. Therefore their wisest waie was to play N

To the profite of Antichrist, and Sathan his maister? Why, all the world could not devise it in better tearmes then it was. To adde vnto it, they least feared: for that was to strengthen it. But to reverse or deface any of it, was to open a gappe. And why should they once dispute of it, who had by it what they would? for they had almost eatē vp all Christēdome. Their wilest way therefore vvas to keepe their ovvne counsaile, and know when they were well. If they thēselues should in the most capitall matters have fallen out, other honester persons might have come by their goods: And they were not so silte, but to vnderstand that by knocking togither, some fire might flye out, which easily might set their Babylon on a flame. So it was their good nature, or rather it was the finger of god, which let so much discord be among them, as that good Christiane might see them to bee naught: but vvithall it vvas their vvi

And wee cannot blame the Devill, after so long experience, and triall vvhat is good for himselfe, if hee endovour vvith all vigilancy to keepe that in quiet, vvhereof hee had gotten possession: And for his servaunts, they being inspired by him were so wise in their generation, as by all meanes to hold that which they had once gained.
               
                  
14 YOV see that Vnity is it, which in this third Reason is vrged: but the true substāce of the matter is scant once thought vpon. For what Christian can say, that For a many of men to agree togither, to dishonour God, is a laudable consent? That then which cheefely is to bee looked vnto, is that the agreement be in truth: Otherwise it is no better then a coniuration or conspiracy.

                  The Kings of the earth hand themselves, and the Princes are assembled togither against the Lord, and against his Christ. And this was fulfilled not onely at his death, but at his birth also, when Math. 2. 3. Herode and Hierusalem vvere troubled about him, and a Councell vvas gathered of Priests and Scribes, combining not to honour him, but to destroy him. Of this forte vvas the confluence of the Dan. 3. 2. Nobles, the Princes, the Dukes, the Iudges, the receivers, the Councellours, the Officers, and all the Governours of the Provinces, when they came vp to the dedication of the Image, which Nabuchedonosor the King had sette vp. The multitude vvere there of one minde: but it vvas to commit Idolatrie: and onely the three children of the Ievvish nation, condescended not to their vvickednesse. I might adde more examples, as that of the Ioseph de bel. Iudaic. lib. 6. 1. seditious at the last seege of Hierusalem, vvho albeit they sometimes turned their svvordes eche against other, yet in this they agreed, that there vvas not a good or honest bodie in the citie, but they ioyned to vexe or murther him. And as these are sufficient witnesses, that in some evill actions men do concurre togither, and dissent not eche from other, so there

have beene sequences, and discents of many ages, wherin whole nations and countries, have with conioyned minds, perpetuated a service to their Gods, the forme whereof was never so much as questioned among them.

And (the Persians excepted vvho are vnder another Prince) this standeth good among so many millions, as bee in Africa, or else-where vnder the Turke; neither is there, or hath beene among them of the same profession, the least dis-agreement. VVhence it followeth that if vvee should allowe the Church of Rome, so much as shee demaundeth, that is to say, that all thinges vvere caried in the same streame among them, yet it concludeth no more, then for the Ethnickes and Heathens, or for the Mahometans and Saracens, vnlesse they can demonstrate, that their conioyning hath beene in verity, and in the inviolable vnity of Gods holie spirite, vvhich if they could averre out of the Scripture which is the touch-stone of truth, they needed not to runne to vncertaine argumentes, and vveake foundations of traditions, customes, and otherlike trashe as they continuallie doc.

Where it is not amisse to consider, that the old veteratorious enemy Sathan, who hath Mille nocendi artes, a thousand devises to do hurt, striveth to bring about his practises by manifold tricks & stratagems. Here his first & chiefest purpose, as best making way to his darke kingdome of hel, is to keep all in ignorance. If that cannot be, but that he is over-mastred, thē his next study is, by the sword of violent persecution, to destroy the professors of Gods truth. If that will not succeede, then he raiseth vp heresies & distractions, among thē who pretend the same verity: Even vpō the cōming of Christ into the world, Sathan had almost al things at his owne will. The Gentiles were not yet come to the light: the Iewes were wel-neere past it: but neither among the one nor the other, was much faith to be foūd. How did this Beelzebub struggle to keep the world in these termes, whē he would haue had Mat. 2. 13. Christ to be murthered in his cradle, & afterward left him not till he brought him to his crosse? Wel, this would do no good, but for one stēme cut down, their grew vp many young plants, al taking their vital nourishmēt frō the first root. The Rom. 10. 1

                  sound of the Apostles doctrine, went out through all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world. Here then Sathan being put to his shiftes, turned over a nevve leafe. If he could not stoppe the streame, hee thought he woulde poison it, and therefore sendeth in the Nicolaitanes, Ebion and Cerinthus with their complices immediatly, who shoulde mixe

the good graine with cockle and darnell. This was his manner of assaulting at the first. Yet was he not so simple, but to his best power, hee helde his first grounde: Better no Christians at all, then some Christians true and some counterfeit. A second time therfore he falleth on the well head, with earnest desire either to dry it or to damme it vp. By Decius and Ualerian and the rest of the bloudy Emperours, he exciteth ten most terrible persecutions, by the which vntil wel neere 300. yeeres after Christ, he thought to have r

But after the time by his own counsaile appointed, God was pleased to stey the fury & rage of tyrants, sending that his blessed servant Constantine, and the other Emperours, who openly professed for the Christiā faith. And now the floud-gats of the Gospel being so wide set open through a great part of the world, the Devill had his hands & his head too ful to do some-thing which might serve for his purpose.

Yet to say that among any, or all of these Christians, there was no verity or solidity of faith or Religion, had bin an absurde conclusion, and such a one as our Romanists themselves would quickly deny. There were many who walked in by-pathes, and yet there vvere vvho kepte the right way also. GOD had his Saintes, and Sathan his schismatickes.
               16 The reason why such heresies did spring vp in the church, was partly to be derived from Gods determinate counsaile, and partly from the malice of our olde deadly enimy. They had both their purposes in it, but the one holy and good, & the other like himselfe full of improbity and impiety. 1 Cor 11. 19. 
                  There must bee Heresies among you saith Saint Paule, that they which are approved among you might be knowne. And Contr. hoeres. c. 15.

And to this purpose speaketh Saint Augustine:

For these and the like instructions of his people, God saffereth Heresies, rentes and schismes to bee: but Sathans proiect is, by infection to destroy the soules of men, and therefore hee is busie in stirring vp of them; vvhich vvas vvell knovve to Cyprian vvhen he said, De simplicit. praelator.

                  The Devill doth vnderstand that our life is charitie, and our death is dissension, hee sent strifes therefore among Christians, because hee coulde not frame vnto the Christians diverse Gods, hee multiplied sectes, hee sovved errours, hee erected Heresies, but vvhatsoever hee did, hee made of the Lordes chaffe.

                   and other, so soone by the eares with the Orthodoxe. But Sathan vvas vnvvilling to loose any time, and therefore even at the first bestirred him. Nowe in the darke time of Popery God having beene pleased to determine before, that an 2. Thes. 2. 3 Apostasie there should bee, and the woman should bee with-drawne into the Apoc. 12. 6 wildernesse, and Antichristes kingdome should bee erected, flourishe and dominere, vvhat reason had Sathan, to set men to contende about the foundations of his building?

them at variance about their Religion? If ignorance would kill soules, the daies abounded in ignorance; if superstition would destroy, they had it in great plenty; if idolatrie would doe him any pleasure, they wanted none of that; if security would further him, they had it and made much of it. What could he wish more, when the greatest sort of worldlings daunced after his pipe, and were as glad to come in, as he to open his dores? Hee had doated as I thinke, if he could not have kept his owne counsaile. But in that fault you shall not take him. The care therefore of him and his ministers was, to keepe all vpright, or at least to preserve the ground-worke of his building, and if any of his children at their play did fall out, he closed it vp againe aswell as he could, & had his officers for that purpose. If any other did but baye, or open, against this his setled common-wealth, he vvas not amicus Curiae, a friende to the Courte: either bring him to conformitie or Crucifige. So you may behoulde the reason, why in the deepe time of ignoraunce, there was such a confederacy or conspiracy rather, to have all vnder silence. It was like the Iustin. l. 5.

               17 But when God was once purposed to open the gate of his mercy, and the dore of his truth, the case was altered with the worlds olde maister. As Basile therefore saith of vertue and vice, so Sathan did with verity and errour. De vera virginitate. Where a dore is of vertue saith he, there on either side is set a dore of vice, the entraunces of which are very like to the other of vertue. By which likenesse it commeth to passe, that many a one comming to enter at the right passage, mistaketh the dore, & by a wrong opinion getteth him into the house of vice. Thus did the Devill deale by truth. Onely there is this difference, that for one dore of verity, hee made very many of errour and heresie, and by the mist which he

And this did that holy father vtter, even in the very matter which I haue now in hand, making answere touching the diversity of opinions, and the manifold heresies, which in his time were among the Christians. He sheweth it to be an argument of excellencie, and not of badnesse, that many would shrowde their conceites, vnder the name of true religion. I would that our English Papists would weigh this answere of Saint Chrysostomes well, and then they shall finde, that if there haue beene many vp-startes since the time of Luther & Calvine, who vnder colour of their patronage would broach somewhat, whē in very deede they dissent frō them, & are cōdemned by them; this doth magnify the verity of those holy mens doctrine, and sheweth the Divels policie, to set many to resemble them, that so hee may disgrace the truth, by a multitude of various & independent lyes. What mony coiner was ever so foolish, as to coūterfeit a coūterfeit coine, or that which of it selfe is base? but the purest gold, and most fine mony is that, which lewd persons offer and attempt to resemble. Thus the weakest Reader may beholde the vanity of the Doctours thirde Reason, and see that their Vnity is against God, & ours is in God and for Christ: and if there should be difference in actions amongst vs, it is no other thing then was betweene Act. 15. 39.

There did the students bind thēselues by othe, not to liue any more vnder the government of the Iesuits. Yea so vehement was the sedition once, that like mad men they did runne out toward the Popes pallace; but from his Holinesse that now is, they were commaunded to retire to their lodgings. They made many seditious sermons against their governours, in the Colledge. In the yeare 1596 when Car. dinall Sega prefixed his letters, signifying his intent, by a Visitation to looke into them, they disgracefully tore his letters. Among these gallants perhaps was our M. Hill, but then not Doctour, but knowne by the name of Thomas Hill Priest, although afterward he, if it were he, cryed Creake for it, and togither with fiue other Priests, was induced to write to Aqua viva the Generall of the Iesuits, a solemne letter of thankes, because in the yeare 1507. he left father Parsons, to take vp controversies in the Colledge at Rome; And the same May 15. 1597. commendations of father Persons appeasing all, did Thomas Hill write to D.

But yet the Iesuites are not too forward to attribute much credite vnto this Thomas; for it is but a poore testimony, which the Rectour there giveth him; we doe not heart but Hill hath behaved himselfe wel since. But he affirmeth that before time hee was vehement against the fathers, vpon errour and evill informed zeale as may be supposed. I make some doubt whether that Hill mentioned in the Apologie be my Doctor, or no; because (as I am informed) there were two in the Seminary called by the name of Thomas Hill. One of this two desiring to be fine, before that he was handsome, would

needes in imitation of the Italian Friers, teach his Auditours in his Sermons, how they should fly in a coach to heaven, whereof this coach must bee made, what ones the horses should be that must draw it, wherewithall they must be fed, & such other stuffe, till that his hearers did laugh at his eloquence, and deride his discretion. This later do I suppose to be the Authour of this volume. In all this forenamed controversie I do not much finde any vniformity in the peace of mens mindes, or one heart and one soule. This preaching one against another did shew the contrary thervnto. But yet that other preaching long since, did shew it mere, when (as the Waldenses did cōplaine) the followers of the Pope in 
                  Confes. Wald. In fascic. rer. expetenda. 
                  their sermons did call one another schismatikes, heretikes, sacrilegious, false Prophets, ravening wolues, the beast and whore in the Apocalypse. This of all likelyhood did shew diversity and distraction in doctrine. And shall we not imagine that so it was, when thirteene Benno Card. de vita Greg. 7. Cardinals seeing the Apostasie of Hildebrand, or Pope Gregory the seventh, did depart frō 
                  his Communion, that is, would not be partakers of the Eucharist, where he was to communicat. If I should vrge any more examples, it should be of the Iesuites, who are charged, in ordinary practise to dissent from the rest of the Popish Church in Fraunce, in more then fifty matters. Some of them may wel be said to be points doctrinal, as these, Iesuit Cat. Lib. 2. 1.

                  Catholike Church as first was propagated by the Apostles themselues, almost through all knowne countreyes. Now all this while there was no Pope; and if it should bee obiected (as no other shift there is in the world, and that is but a simple one) that Peter as Pope sent the rest of the Apostles, some to this place, some to that, I require one text o
                     •…
                   scripture to bee shewed, or one monument of antiquity to be produced, which maye confirme so much. It is not vnlikelye, but that the

Apostles in some assembly at Hierusalem did consent, what regions each of them should betake themselues vnto: but that any one did appoint to the rest their charges, we no where find. Nay plaine it is that Peter himselfe, had his portion assigned him, to preach to the Gal. 2. 7. Iewes, as Paule had to preach to the Gentiles, which was the greater charge. And whither this were appropriated to him by God, as the text seemeth well to encline, or whither by the consent also of the Apostles; Paule had his Commission in the same manner; which he so little thinketh inferiour to the others, that he Ibidem. nameth it before Peters, and standeth vpon ver. 8. & 9. tearmes of equality in power, and fellowship in action. But that I may force the authour of this libell to say, Penne thou writest vntruth, Samaria received Christ, by the preaching of Act. 8. 5. 14. Philip, before that Peter knew of it, and the 27. Eunuch of Aethiopia on the way, was in like sort brought to religion by the same Philip, and he went home immediately, and planted the faith in his Countrey (as Eccl Hist. Lib. 2. 1. Eusebius sheweth) which was done without Peters privity: for a good space after that, hee made doubt, whither the Gentiles might haue the worde opened to them, vntill that by a vision Act. 10. 10. from heaven that scruple was removed. And I pray you was there nothing done by Saint Paul, whose authority was immediate from Galat.

The history of whose labours in turning men to Christ, although Saint Luke doth particularly relate in the Actes of the Apostles, yet for brevity sake we will looke to one place only, of his owne testimony; and he saith that Rom. 15. 19 
                  from Hierusalem, & rounde about vnto Illyricum, he caused the Gospell of Christ to abound. And to take away all pretence of obiection he addeth, that he preached the Gospell where vers. 20. Christ was not named, least hee shoulde haue built on another mans foundation. If these things be so plaine as no Christian can doubt of them, blush and blush againe at such desperate audaciousnesse, as maketh no conscience, egregiously to faine.

                  TRue it is that Heretikes have corrupted such as were Catholikes before, but that they ever converted any Heathen Nation to Christianity, can never bee shewed. I know very well that Iohn Calvine to get glorie, sent certaine of his Ministers into nevve-founde landes: but I never coulde heare that any of them converted so much as one sily vvoman to their Gospell in those partes. The trueth is, their agreement in doctrine vvas so greate, that one destroying anothers buildings, they became laughing flockes to the Heathens, and so vvere glad to depart with shame.

               3 THAT Heretikes haue corrupted such, as were weaklings or discontented persons, is true: and may well bee exemplified in your broode perverting diverse credulous and indiscreete folkes, from their obedience to God and their Princes: but they are not sounde Catholikes, or vvell setled and grounded in the faith, who will listen to you, or any seducer. And if there bee any heathen nation vvhich hath hearde of the name Christ by you, and your polluted Christianity; it is most certaine, that it hath bin by Heretikes, the servauntes and attendantes of the whore of Babylon, beeing a hundred waies infected with heresie; and the vvhole body of Popery where it differeth from vs, being nothing else but a masse of abhominable heresie.

And when diverse of the Ministerie leaving their countrie, kinred, and that estate which they had in Fraunce, were come thither with those resolutions, they never dissented in the least pointe of the

But Uillagagno like a notable Hypocrite, togither with a Popish Priest of his, one Cointas, (who had before abiured Popery there, as also the Generall voluntarilie had done) relapsed to their vomite, evill entreated their Ministers by all meanes that they could devise, set the companie vpon a mutinie, and forced such as lost not their lives there, to returne to their country, when they had scant spente one yeare in those partes, and that full of vexation, by reason of their Conductours perfidious falshood. This was the reason, wherefore that viage sorted to small purpose; and not the discorde of the Ministers. And this wicked practise did arise from the Cardinall of Lorraine, who either in secret before the departure of Uillagagno, or afterward by letters drewe him to Apostate from his faith,

of CHRIST, that hee could not endure, that the Frenchmen should have it at home or abroade, least belike multitudes of them should have left their countrie, and built Colonies elsewhere. So he cared not what losse or dishonour the kingdome of Fraunce had, so there might be no Sanctuary, or refuge for those whome hee reputed heretikes, dealing as honestly and faithfully therein, as Steven Gardiner while hee lived, and afterwardes other of the Cleargie, did with Caleis in Queene Maries time: which towne they vnderstanding to be the receptacle of many good Christians, fled out of England for their conscience; were so averse from regarding, repayring and supplying it, that the French discrying the weakenesse thereof, by attempting it both sodeinely and subtilely, & afterward pursuing their enterprise fearcely, did get it from the English. Such was the blessed minde of that Machiavellian Cardinall, whome GOD Commentar. Relig. & Reip. in Gal. Lib. 13. remembred at the last, suffering him by a colde (which he had taken by going barefoote, and whipping himselfe for his lascivious sinnes) to grow first into a fever, and then into a madnesse, which sent him raving, and foolishly speaking, to receive his iudgement. The Queene mother as ashamed that Ahitophel shoulde proove Nabal, caused it to bee reported about the Courte, that the man went to GOD, in most sweete meditations; but the other was so evident, that every bodye laughed at the simplicitie of their devise, who would have that covered, which the Lorde had shewed of purpose, that every ones 1.

I may not therefore heere forget, that it is receaved for a veritie, that yet long before the daies of Lucius and Eleutherius, the seede of the Gospell was sowen in Britaine, evē in the prime age of the Apostles, by Ioseph of Arimathea; which by the Iesuite Controv. cap. 2. 
                  Costerus is not concealed when he saith, For men vvill have, or they say, that Ioseph of Arimathea in the Apostles time was in England, and that Simon the Leaper didgovern the Church Cenomanensis in Fraunce. And to manifest that this is verie probable, it shall not be amisse brieflie to cite such reasons, as Maister 
                  Eccle. Histor. l. 2. 
                  Foxe hath collected, to shewe that the Britaines had receaved CHRIST, before the daies of Eleutherius and Lucius, vvho lived about the yeare of our LORD 180. First hee citeth out of De victor. Aure
                        •…
                      Ambros. Gildas, that in the yeare 63. Philip the Apostle sent Ioseph of Arimathea hither out of Fraunce, and he first laide the foundation of Christian Religion. Secondly out of Tertullian, that Contr. Indaeos. 
                  the places of the Britaines which were inaccessible by the Romans, were subiect to Christ. Thirdly out of Homil. 4. in Ezech. 
                  Origene specifying that since the comming of Christ, Britaine did consent to the knowledge of the onely God, and both Tertullian and Origene, hee reputeth to bee, before the time of Eleutherius a little. Fourthly out of Bede 
                  Histor. Eccl. l. 5. 22. signifieth that the Britaines in his time, especially such as had not conformed themselues, a little before to the Romane fashion, did keepe their Easter after the manner of the East Church. Fiftly out of Petrus 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   writing to Saint Bernard, and affirming that the Scots kept their Easter in the same manner, which sheweth that all the partes of this Ilande were brought to CHRIST, by some who came out of the East; or else the ceremonies should have beene planted after the fashion of the VVesterne Church. Sixtly out of Lib. 2. 40 
                  Nicephorus, affirming that Simon Zelotes brought the Gospell into the Iles of Britaine. Seaventhly Epistol. ad Eleuther. from Lucius himselfe, vvho plainely signifieth that hee had received CHRIST, before the sending to Eleutherius for the Romane Lavves. These reasons collected by Maister Foxe are more of force, then the slight testimonies of such late vvriters, as may mistake one thing for another, the sending for

of the Imperial lawes, to be to call for the faith of Christ. But admit it were thus, and we should yeeld to the conceipt of these later authors, what maketh this for them, or against vs? Since the words of the Apostle Paule may be vsed in this behalfe, 1. Cor. 14. 36. 
                  Came the word of God out from you? that is to say, were you the first citty whence the Gospell was derived? was it Rome it selfe that had it originally? or was it not rather converted, by that which came from Ierusalem? That cittie in Iudea was the fountaine of all, & therefore if any place should be respected for that which is past, Hierusalem shoulde bee renoumed, and magnified even of Rome it selfe, and of all other, because from thense all primarilie, (albeit some mediately and some immedi
                     •…
                  tely) sucked the doctrine of the Christian faith. But as our Papistes in this case make no account of Hierusalem, since the glorie both inward and outward thereof is decayed, so wee make as little reckoning of Rome, which is so vtterly swarved from the puritie of that profession, which it had not onely in the time of the Apostles, but even of Eleutherius, that vix

               5 VVhat a harvest your Dominicane and Franciscane Friers have made in the Indies, I deferre to recount till I come to the nexte Chapter. Onely heere I tell you, that vpon vncontroulable warrant wee finde not, that almost any man of worth, for learning, wisedome, warfare or government, hath by his conversion given any testimony to Christendome, of the good which your Friers have done among the Indians. You please your selues with fancies, and mulus mulum scabit, one of you doth falsely trumpet the praises of another. If you be such convetters, why goe you not into Africa, into the kingdomes of Marocco and Fez, to Tunis or Argier? From Spaine or Italie, the distance is not much to these. Or why do you not crosse the Adriatike sea, & step into Grecia or Morea? why traveile you not farther to Constantinople, Tripoly or Aleppo to winne men from Mahomet, which is so much the easier, because all these Turkes & Saracens admit of some Positions belōging to the Christiā faith, but the Indians accept of none. Truth it is, that vnto these places,

other nations of Christendome for trafficke do resort; and therefore if you should report any vntruth cōcerning these, you would quickly be disproved. But far traveilers may say more then ordinary men, and for that cause you tell vs a tale of the Indies, and some of your men say that there they cast out Devils also. They do wel to lay it in places so distant
                     •…
                   for although they egregiously faine, yet we shal hardly take them tripping: it is no ready worke to convince them. But wee imagine that your attemptes for conversion, may have the same successe in the East and VVest Indies, as the offer of your Maff Hist. Lib. 1. Portingale Priestes and Friers had in Congo, where adventuring vpon verie small acquaintance, to baptize the king and the inhabitantes, the most part as your Historiographer saith, (but it is to be feared that all) quickly renounced Christianity, & returned to their heathenish wallowing in the mire. They disliked not the first principles of the faith, neither the Ceremonies therein, but when they were called vpon to leave their grosse vices, as adultery and witchcrafte and seeking to Devils, to remitte iniuries, to restore thinges vniustly taken each from other, they would not endure these exhortations, but like reneging Apostatas they became as before. And of likely-hood so it fell out frequently with the Spanyards in America, where they Petr. Martyr. Decad. 3. 10. were exceeding nimble in administring baptisme, to those who knewe very little. Had it not beene fit, that before the Sacrament had beene imparted, the Infidels should out of Gods booke largely haue heard of many thinges? which course Iohn the Baptist did take, preaching repentaunce; Math. 3. 2 and that woulde well have tryed them before hande, and so Gods name might not haue beene dishonoured, nor Baptisme abused, nor the people made the worse, nor the Priest never the better. Doth not the true Church of Christ gaine much by such titulary bargaines, and is not Gods kingdome much increased through it? And yet doubtlesse such good matches your Friers also make in the Indies, but especially in those of the East, where the inhabitants have more witte, and your messengers have lesser power. And if it bee so and no otherwise, yet with vs heere in Europe, all these must goe for good Christians, and if there bee a score of such Nu

Thence came the sentence against King Henry the eight. Thence was continuall hatred derived against our late Soveraigne, from the day of her birth, vntill her dissolution from this mortalitie.

He who wrote the Iesuites Catechisme in French, as he hath many memorable matters, touching the sweete and sacred vices of these vnblessed and irreligious Fathers, so hee hath some thing touching Englande, as that Lib. 3. 3. Parrhyes attempt in the yeere 1584, And Cap. 4. Squires in the yeere 1597, was plotted, incouraged and abetted by the Iesuites, as hee sheweth by the whole processe of it. These devises can bee the execution of no function which is holy, vnlesse you will take it to bee holy after the Devils fashion. And may it not vvell bee supposed, that they vvho vvere so vvickedly affected tovvarde our last Soveraigne, vvill carrye the same minde tovvarde our present King, the mirrour of all Princely vertues, vnlesse the everlasting blessing of God, and prudent fore-fight otherwise do restraine them?

Their vow of blinde obedience to their Superiours, their position of ordine ad Deum, their rule of propter bonum societatis, will inferre any varletry, traiterousnesse, vilainy, or impiety in the worlde, bee it whatsoever.

If then for these and the like reasons, the King of Fraunce professing for the Romish faith, hath by solēne Edict banished these Iebusites out of his kingdome, and that on paine of death, and they are not harboured in his Realme, but only in Burdeaux and Tholouse, which is to be hoped will also shortly bee redressed; is it to be wondered, that our kingdome professing the reformed religion, & being England which of old could endure no wolues

should abandon this lewde Society?

               I will not here speake of the infinite number of Miracles, wrought by Catholickes in conversion of Countreys, and namely of those which are now done in both the Indies, by the holy Fathers aforesaide, for that I reserve that matter for his proper place: but I would advise you here diligently to weigh the sequele of the Assertion of the Protestantes: howe that if Papistes be not true Christians, and of the right religion then doth it necessarily followe, that neither Spanyards, nor Portingales, nor Sardinians, nor Sicilians, nor Italians, nor Germaines, nor Transylvanians, nor Hungarians, nor Polouians, nor Danes, nor Flemmings, nor Scots, nor Irish, nor English, no nor any Nation vnder heaven had ever true Religion, before Frier Luther maried Moune Bore, before Iohn Calvin run away to Geneva, before Peter Martyr with his Fustolugges came to teach at Oxford, and before a number of such like good companions, ledde only by sensualitie and carnall zeale dishodded themselues and became such spectacles to the world as every mā knoweth. Which thing to affirme is flatly to denie Christ, and all Christianity, as I shewed in my first Reason.

For if you have named the French also, & the Bohemians, & Muscovits & Graecians, we must answere you that among these or so many of these, as it seemed good to the divine Providence, there was true Religion; and yet the grosser sort of your Papistes had none of it, albeit some touched with some smal staines of Popery did belong to Gods kingdome. And these were not only before the birth of these excellent men whō you name, but in all ages since Christ his time. VVherefore your bold talking heere, is no better then idle trifling.

Then by the iudgement of Iustine there is no doubt, but men may make too large vowes to God himselfe. In as much then as these persons had taken on thē a yoke, which though it be not so, absolutely to all, yet to them in their conscience was insupportable, and they felte with themselues that they might not continue vnder that burrhen without grievous sinne for the preventing whereof the Apostle had propounded a remedy, 1: Cor: 7. 9 
                  If they cannot abstaine let them mary, for it is better to mary then to burne, I doubte not but in the feare of God, with sober & long deliberation they did vndoe that, which by the incitement of their friendes, or indiscreetely of their owne heades they had formerly done. And that Lord who vnder the Levitical law was so merciful, as to appoint a Levit: 5: 4: trespasse offering for such a one as had made any vow rashly, assigning him to confesse his fault & thē pardoning the same, would also remitt vnto his excellēt servants, whō he had singled out to help so much to the building of his tabernacle, that temerations bond which they had made, since with repētāce & grief, they acknowledged their former presūption that way. And that such who after their vowe could not liue cōtinētly, might mary, Epiphanius doth witnes, who whē he hath distinguished betweene iudgment & condemnation, & said Epiphan: Haeres: 611

                     demnatiō
                   he resolveth the case thus: It is better therfore to have one sin & not more. It is better that he who is fallen frō his course, should opēly take vnto him a wife according to the law, and from his virginity a great while should repent, and so againe be brought into the Church, as one that hath wrought evill, as one who is fallen and broken, and hath neede of binding vp, & not to be woūded every day with secret darts, by the wickednes which is brought vpon him by the Devill. Thus the Church knoweth to preach. These are the medicines of healing. These are the kindes of annointing cōfession. And Ierome although whē he was yong he had writē, Virgins 
                  Lib: 1: contr lovinian 
                  which after their cōseerating haue maried are not so much adulterous as incestuous, which is to bee vnderstood, if they might

any waies containe, yet thirty yeares after (for so it is to be collected out of his Epistle Ad Demetriadem) seeing how the Church was blemished by the incontinency and want onnesse of some Votaries, saith thus, The name of some Virgins who beare not themselves well, doth defame the holy purpose of Virgins, and the glory of the family of heaven and Angels. Unto whom it is openly to be said, that either they shoulde mary if they cannot containe themselues, or should containe, if they be vnwilling to mary. Thus this father permitteth mariage to vowed persons, if they cannot chastly leade a single life, neither doth he thinke their mariage to be a sinne, as neither did Saint Austen: but if there bee a faulte, it is because they breake their vow. Aug. de bono vidui. tat cap. 9.

                  vndertaking from an inferiour good, but a fall frō a higher good. So speaketh hee who both there and In psa. 83. else-where liketh not the slipping from vowed virginity; which wee also doe not like, if there be any godly meanes to continue in it, without perpetuall enormous sinne; wherein the triall must be a mans owne conscience soberly and most advisedly consulted, as betweene God & the soule, and not the opinions of other men. And I may not doe such wronge to Luther & his wife, or to other of that time, as not to thinke that with long & ponderous advise, they weighed what was fittest in this case to be done.
               8 That Iohn Calvine did run away to Geneva is a ridiculous accusation, much false, and more foolish. And whereas you suppose that he was the first who preached the Gospell at Geneva, as now it is there preached, that is one of your ignorances: for a reverend man Farellus by name, did plant the same doctrine in Geneva, before that Calvine came thether: Which if no body else would haue told you, you might haue learned of in Antid. Matth 23. Stapleton. But before both those, as also before the comming of Peter Martyr to Oxford, even from our Saviours time, the truth which wee professe, is and hath ever beene: and when you haue brabbled as long as you can, you shall never shew to the contrary. Now when you name these three, Luther, Calvin and Martyr, you do not dishonour them, but grace them, since when they are rightly

thought of, they are like 2. Sam. 23 12. three of Davids worthies, or in a sorte like the Dan. 3. 12. three children which were in the fiery furnace and not burnt, beeing ever in the flame of Popish rancour and slaunder, & al maledicous defamation, and yet louely to the places where they lived, dying all of them in peace, and the memory of them blessed, as being great bel-wethers in Gods flocke, & renoumed Captaines in the Lordes battailes. Howe happy are those men, who for their constant standing in the gappe, against Sathan & Antichrist, are every day illustrated, and made celebrious, by the maligning of the adversaries of truth? Their soules are in peace, and their glory is promulgated by their enemies trumpets, who the more they oppugne them, the more we doe loue them, and eternise the memory of them. These and other their consorts, as the Archbishop Cranmer with other of the English, Melācthon and Bucer, and Fagius and many more of their ranke, were no such loose companions and sensuall men as you fondly doe here intimate, neither ever did they become bad spectacles to the world, but ledde their liues in study, in preaching and writing, which may well appeare by such volumes of their workes, as having beene laide on the Popes backe, haue broken many ribs of him, that they never will be able to close againe. Their learning, their industry, their faithfulnesse, their vertuous conversation every way, might bee a glasse and mirrour to your Cardinals and Bishops, and all your Romish Cleargy, where for the most parte ignoraunce and idlenesse, and wantonnesse doth abound. And what marvaile can it be, that men so fore-ordained by the secret providence of the Almightye, to doe such noble service in the campe of the everlasting Lord, and to ransake the wals of Babylon, should vpon the apprehension of Gods pleasure therein, make speede to come forth of spirituall Gomorrha, and lay aside their superstitious and Frierly weede, which was the livery of him, who was mortall enemy to their Master Christ Iesus? if Gen. 39 12 Ioseph were praise-worthy for leaving his owne garment behinde him, rather then to yeeld to any lewd action which might concerne manners, how are they to be honoured for leaving the Divels cloath, whē they might not enioy it, vnlesse they did prostitute both body & soule to idolatrous abominatiō? And whereas

here you bestow your remembrance on Peter Mattyrs vvife, how blessed was shee living, and howe happy is her soule nowe, that shee shoulde in such sort bee exagitated for Christ his sake? Shee was neither flaps nor fustelugs, but a woman indeed of body reasonably corpulent, but of most matron-like modesty, for the which shee was much reverenced by the most: shee was of singular patience, of excellent artes and qualities, and among other things, for her recreation she delighted to cut plūmestones into curious faces and countenances, of which exceeding artificially done, I once had one with a womans visage and heade attire on the one side, and a Bishop with his miter on the other, which was the elegant worke of her hands. By diverse yet living in Oxford this good woman is remembred, and commended as for her other vertues, so for her liberality to the poore, which by Master In Histor. Eccl. Sub Maria Reg. Foxe writing how shee was entreated after her death is rightly mentioned. For loue of true religion, and the company of her husband, shee left her owne countrey to come into England in K. Edwards daies, and so good was her fame here, that when the Papists in Q. Maries time being able to get nothing against her beeing dead, were yet desirous to wreske their teene vpon her integrity, they would needes rage vpon the bones of her, a woman and a stranger, and tooke them out of her graue from Christian buriall, and buryed them in a doung-hill.

                     Pascitur in vivis livor, post fata quiescit.
                  
                  
                     Envy doth vse on living folkes to gnawe:
                     But bee they dead, shee doth her selfe with-draw.
                  
Yet this was their Romish charity and Popish humanity, which one wondring at, did recommende the remembraunce of it to these verses:
               
                  Foemineum sexum Romani semper amarunt:
                  Proijciunt corpus cur muliebre foras?
                  Hoc si in quaras, facilis responsio danda oft,
                  Corpor a non curant mortua, viva petunt.
                  The Popish crow haue evermore the female sexe embraced,
                  How is it that a womans corse they haue from graue displaced?
                  Thus if you aske, right readily mine answere may be this,
                  Their bodies deade they care not for, liue ones they clip and kisse.

But this your asseveration you exemplifie first in Gregory the 13. who in the founding of Seminaties and Colledges in divers landes, spent all the revenewe of the Popedome. I haue tolde you before of your generall speeches without sence, reason and probability. Were you great Treasurer, or Maister of the Fisco in those daies, that you either knew his receipts or his expences? How did his Holynesse maintaine his estate, his family, his souldiours, his gard, his gallies, & those huge sūmes, wherat great Cōmanders are everie day? How did he send abroad his spies, and mainetaine discorde

among Christian Princes? Did not his purse walke, thinke you? And since his own revenew was spent as you say, did he borrow, or go to best be trust for al the rest?

Yet how long this full pay lasted no body can tell. And we must take it to be so on Father Persons his bare word, who as one of the Io. Colletons iust defence. pag. 298.

And their allowāce being extracted out of this sweet Impost, the speech of one of our coūtry-mē might the better be verified, which I cōfes was very bloūt, but you must take it as it is.

                  Plato, for the purging of ill humours: they must away. If they see them sufficiently

armed to do mischiefe, they must away. So must they doe if their maintenance growe shorte.

These Iesuits also do diligently take heed, that no mōk of any other order be receiued into those lāds. So making thēselues Lords of all matters & men, they do there exercise most rich & most frequēted traffickings. Here thē is now the first credible relatiō that they haue won some to their popery; but whither these were wise people or no, to be thus circūvented, other men may iudge.

This is a taste to you D.

And albeit the times and present occasions were such, that by necessitie the expence of her Highnesse, was rather imployed vpon Souldiours, thē on Seminaries & Colledges, yet the resolutiō of her as

of a most Christiā Princesse was illustrious that way, whē beyond the consultations and advises of all her Graces most noble Progenitours, yea beyond the opinion of Stephen Gardiner himselfe, as L.

And if all this had bin done by her Maiesties charge, yet howe small would that have beene, in comparison of those masses of treasure, which in warlike service have beene within these fewe yeares expended.

For which respects the company of other women, vvho are of approved fame, is not vnprofitable, when men goe aboute the winning of soules; since they in private and with their owne sexe, may be potent. And wee doubt not but many of them in their places doe God very good service, his mercy accepting of their obedience and faith, as well as of that in men; whereof besides a thousande other, this may be one argument, that our blessed Saviour himselfe, in his ter-sacred and immaculate affection, fancying (as I may say) some more then other, with an extraordinary humane kindnesse, is reported by the Evangelist to haue loved in that sort but fowre, whereof two were men, & two were women: the disciple Ioh. 13. 23. whom Iesus loved, and Iesus Cap. 11. 5 loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus. Your scorne therefore against woman-kinde, may be returned vpon your selues, who rather loue to commit sinne cantè, then in honest marriage to liue castè; and there-vpon some of you like travailers, do make bolde rather where you come, then be at any further trouble, as that Mat.

The Iesuite had quite forgot the Mossacre Commentar: Relig: & Reip: in Gallia: l: 10. at Paris at Bartholomew-tide 1572. when at the mariage of a king to the daughter & sister of a King, so many thousands of Noble men and meaner persons, assembled thither vpō the fidelity of a king, were slaine in their beddes, or in their owne or their friendes lodgings. That was it whereof Campian with

those words should haue spokē. But his malice rather served him, and fitter it was for his purpose, falsly to accuse that Reverende man Theodore Beza, that he had perswaded Poltrot to kill the Guize at the seege of Oreleans. We allow not of the deed, but vtterly condemne the fact: & there was never learned man of our party, who defended it or excused it. The malefactour also received condigne punishment for his labour. Indeede the Ibid. lib. 6. & 7. Guizes after the death of their father, did publikely giue out, that the Admirall and one other noble man had hyred Poltrot ther-vnto, and that Beza had approved the deed; but when the admiral heard of it, he knowing it to be a malicious slaunder, did by publike writing require, that according to the lawes of Iustice, Poltrot who was reported to haue said so much in his torture, might be kept aliue, that he might come face to face to iustifie himselfe: but this was denied, and Poltrot in all hast was executed. But when the rumour still cōtinued, that the Admirall was touchable with the fact, he putteth forth an honorable declaration, & Protestation of his innocency therein, which was so apparantly true, that the king at Molune in Bourbon, did by opē sentence cleere him, and acquite him of that vniust imputation. Now the maine fact being avoided, Beza proveth to bee innocent; since by his most desperate enemies he was never thought to be more then an accessary, by allowing it at the instance of the Admiral, wheras in truth he spake not with Poltrot, but was more then an hundred miles of from him. And yet, notwithstanding that all this is as evident as the Sunne, good Doctor Hil, doe you keepe the lie going, and let it not die in your hands.
               16 But if we shall rightly scanne who they be, whom an ill spirit in this case pricketh forewarde, let vs remember the practise of the Papacy in this behalfe. Was it not the Ibid. li. 10. younger Guize, as holy a Catholike as his Father, who suborned one to shoote the Admirall with a Pistole, at the cruell Battlemewtide in Paris? And when that wounde proved not to be mortall, did not he in person come to his lodging at midnight, & send vp cut-throates to murther him? VVas it not the Popish crewe, (wherein by greate probability King Philip himselfe, and the Duke of Parma also had a finger) who first procured Dinoth. de bel. civil. Belgie. li. 5. lauregny to shoote the

Prince of Orenge with a Dagge, and some yeares afterward Balthazar with the like weapon to kill him? If ought could be saide for these things, yet what can be answered for the death, of K. Meterran. Hist lib. 5. Henry the 3. of France, one of your own religion, who was stabbed by the Frier? And this fact was not only liked of by infinite numbers of Papists in France, yea and as it should seeme See the Franc. discourse defended also by publike preaching and writing, but it was allowed of by the Pope and his Cardinals: bone-fires and processions vvere made for it at Rome, yea Sixtus Quintus made a solemne publike Oration, in gratulatiō of the good event, De interdicto Regn Franciae. edit. Francosurti. Anno. 1591 pronoūcing that Clement the Iacobine who perpetrated that vilany, was worthy not only to be reputed a Martyr, but to be reckoned a Saint. All the Papists in the world name the example of such a deede attēpted, or atchieved by the Protestāts, yea or that which may come nere it by 1000. degrees. And was there not in like sort an intendmēt of Iesuit Catech li. 3. 6. Barriere, for the slaughtering of the present K. Henry the 4. which was a second time put in practise by Cap. 8.

Pyramis was erected, which containeth a narratiō of the same. This Edict was ratified by the highest court of France, which yet notwithstanding consisteth most of Papists: & the force of the Edict standeth yet vpright, albeit besides infinite other meanes, La Saincte Messe declar.

And I do verily beleeve, that if matters were now fresh to begin, the King Catholike who now is, & his very wise & sage councel, would be wel advised, before that they would vndertake any courses so apparātly offensiue to the whol body of that people. Notwithstādīg I do leave this whol questiō of the Low-coūtries, to the vnderstāding & cōsideration of the wise, & to that which time shal farther discover. The rising of the Sleidan: Comment: Lib: 4: & 5: Cōmōs in Germany, was not caused by Religiō; for those of greatest fame who professed the religiō, as Luther namely, did disswade them from it, and wrote against them: but it was such a mutiny as sometimes Subiectes make in other Nations, and the like whereof of late the olde Peda: de historias.

Of such insurrections vvhat opinion vvee have, may partely bee

But this did not overthrow the kingdom: no we know that it stādeth to this day in great glory, albeit perhaps that be not wholy to be ascribed vnto thē, who in their chāges did as much looke to seeming ciuil pollicy, as to the veritable & approovable rules of religiō. We doe not hold it to be the power or pleasure of the Subiects, to depose their lawful & obsolute Princes. By God Prov. 8. 15.

               19 When you have alleaged these examples of different kinds and different iudgments, you little remēber what Papistes do in

such cases, When after the conference at Poissy, the An. 8561. Comment. Relig. & Reip. in Gall. Lib. 3: Edict of Ianuary had (vpon some conditions and restraint in circumstances) permitted libertie of religion in Fraunce, did not the olde Duke of Guize being then combined with the Constable and the Marshal of Saint Andrewes (without ground or title, but only to advaunce the Popish cause) with Lib. 4. drawne swords set vpon the Protestants assembled at a Sermon at Vassy, and slew many of them, which afterward cast all Fraunce into a civill warre?

And if in this case the whole world otherwise should be silent, yet the insurrection of the Irish in those late yeares, for and in behalfe of Popery, as also the comming thither of so many Priestes, and their stickling in that businesse, besides the aide

So when that you saide that this was the manner of the Protestantes proceedinges, to plante their Gospell in turbulent sorte, you should have saide Papists, and then you had spoken truely. The rest vvhich you heere adde, containeth vaine vvordes, and that vvhich is nothing material. That vvhich first gave light to Luther, vvas the horrible profanation of the merites of Christes bloud, by setting pardons at sale, and the horrour of his conscience to see Religion in that sorte to bee abused, for gaine to Leo the tenth and his kinred. And against whome should hee bee proude or envious? Against Sleidan. lib. 13. 
                  Tecelius for sooth and ignoraunt and impudent Frier, who gave such immoderate commendations of his Indulgences, as that if a man had defloured the Virgin Marie, and begotten her with childe, yet for mony he could pardon it. Was this man to be envied? or rather to be pitied? or rather to be punished? or rather to

be crucified with some irregular torture? It is a most poore and base slander, to report that Luther was offended, because the sale of the Indulgences was permitted to the other, and not to him. He who looketh vpon the Centu. 16. An. 1517. 95. Propositions, which even vpon the instant he propounded to be disputed vpon, in the Schooles at Wittēberge against Pardons, cannot but see that he had song disliked the vsage of that marchandise, and all the circumstances belōging thervnto. He may easily discerne that his very heart & soul was moved against the matter, & not against Persons only. The abuse of those Indulgēces was so fowle, that Hist. lib. 13 Francis Guicciardine a Papist himselfe doth much dislike it. How Calvin did ill order his life, neither you nor any of your crew can truely report. I know you haue a grosse slaunder spread of him by a lewd companion, contrary to all shew of verity, which when you See the 5. Reason. farther touch, you shal haue farther answered. Of whom you speak in Scotland, you cannot tell your selfe: and therfore I know not for whom to answer. If any being stirred by ambition did amisse, we hold it a fault as wel as you do: but if any did well, and it bee but your conceit that he did it for vaine-glory, the error is yours for iudging so rashly. As for lust, leachery and brutish behaviour, doe not you suspect, but I shall largely proue them to be rather in your men then in vs. In the meane while concerning those who haue beene spreaders of our Religion, it is as much when they are charged with evill things, that Quintil. Lib 5. 12. 
                  Aemilius Scaurus negat as that Quintius Uarius ait, that one doth deny, as that another doth affirme. And for the ground on which they stoode, it was and is such, that none of you can shake it, no nor the Mat 16. 18 gates of hell any way prevaile against it. It is built vpon the Cap 7. 25 rocke, and therefore fret you, and rage you while you will, it cannot be overthrowne. And whereas you say, that they vse their religion but for a serue-turne, to compasse evill practises, you are fowly besides the marke. For they questionlesse were in earnest, & would not otherwise haue left country and friends, and all earthly preferment for their conscience sake, yea their very hues, as thousands of them haue done, within these hundred or two hundred yeares. Yea many of great iudgement haue come from you, as he whom D. Calvino-Turcism. li. 1. 5. Gifford calleth Cardinall Vergerius, but indeede

was but like to haue beene Cardinall, for being without a cause somewhat suspected of Lutheranisme, hee to Slcid. l. 21 purge himselfe thereof taketh penne in hand to write against Luther; where labouring about the point of Iustification, hee had his eies opened to behold the verity, and embraced true Religion, although hee lost his Cardinality for his labour. There might many other bee named, who by choosing want and imprisonment, and al worldly miseries, for the doctrine which wee professe, did shewe that what they did, was to serue no earthly turne, but to saue their soules, and in that they were in very good earnest. These are idle obiections without matter or authority.

                  IT is plaine therefore in my iudgement, that the Catholikes are they, who ever fished simply and sincerely with Saint Peters net, and therein haue inclased miraculous multitudes of fishes, and that the Protestants by their extraordinary and late angling haue caught

                     ore, but such as were in a better and more sound manner taken before. And although Freculphus writeth that the Arrian heretikes converted the whole nation

                  of the Gothes from Paganisme to the faith, in the time of Ualens the Emperour: yet it appeareth by Socrates, Sozomenus & Theodoretus, that the greatest part of those Gothes were Catholike Christian, before, & afterward seduced by the Arrians: for Heretikes cannot possibly convert any to such faith, as may make the cōverted better then they were before.
               
            
            
               G. ABBOT.
               When you say It is plaine in your iudgment, it is the wisest word that you wrote a great while: for your iudgmēt is a very weake one, as by that which is gone before, & that which followeth after, hath and will appeare. If Catholikes be they who fish with Saint Peters net, what is that to you, who are not the one, and doe not the other? You are heretikes, fallen from the sinceritie of Christes faith to humane fables, and your fishing is not like Saint Peters to Luk: 5: 101 catch men to GOD, but to his Arche-enemye at Rome. And vvhat

store you haue taken with your Babylonish baites, will in your next Reason appear. Now whither the Protestants haue caught any or none, let whole Christendome iudge: nay the power and revenew of your Pope so much diminished, will speake if all be silent. But whither they were in better case before, or no, Christ shall pronounce at the day of the generall resurrection, and his word in the meane time shall determine. They who haue felte the servile yoke of your superstitions and inventions, and nowe do truely taste the sweete promises of the Gospell, will not leaue their passage to Canaan, and turne backe into your Egypt, to gaine all the world by the bargaine. We can never yeeld sufficient praises vnto God, who of his mercy hath freely vouchsafed vs that favour, which he hath not afforded to many other. And wee desire to stande Galat. 5. 1. fast in the liberty, wherewith Christ hath  made vs free. Heere you are a happy man that you chaunced to hit vpon the story of the Arrians, for now you cite vs something, wheras for three whole leaues together, we haue had neither text of Scripture, nor authority of any divine or humane writer
                     •…
                  , but only your bare word, and that is worth but a little. Well, Freculphus saith that the Arrians converted the whole Nation of the Gothes, in the daies of the Emperour Valens, from paganisme to the faith. But there bee three Ecclesiasticall historiens vvho seeme to crosse that. Let vs heare them speake. Socr. 4. 27 Socrates saith, that vnder Valens, or in his time many of the Gothes received the Christian faith, and he addeth that to please the Emperour, they addicted themselues to the Arrian sect. Here then there is nothing which hindereth, but that many of them might be new converted at the very first by those heretikes. Theod. 4: 32. Theodoret indeede hath it, that being formerly converted to Christ, and beleeving aright, yet when they were enforced to seeke friendship at the hand of Valens, by the instigation of Eudoxius a great Arrian neere about him, they were swayed by the Emperour to entertaine the Arrian heresie. And Vlphilas their owne Bishop was a maine forwarder thereof.

                     . 6: 37. with this, that is to say, that Vlphilas who before had been a means to bring them to the Christian faith, was afterward won over to be an Arrian, and by his incitement, as also to satisfie Valens,

the Gothes became of that beleefe.
               21 But the errour whereinto these writers did run, partly by living so far of, and partly for lacke of distinct knowledge, howe many divers people of the Gothes there were, whom they, (especially the two later writers Theodoret and Sozomen) do cō
                  found and put togither, is explicated by Iornandes, who of purpose writeth a Iornandes de rebus Geticis. story of the Gothes, and lived among them now more then a thousand yeares agone, even vnder the Emperour Iustian, about the yeare of Christ 530. Hee then relateth it thus. That there was a people called Ostrogothes, & another tearmed Vese-Gothes, dwelling not far each from other, & the one of thē in ancient time descended from the other. The Ostro-Gothes had formerly received the faith, but being beaten and pitifully killed by the Hunnes, a rude nation and not heard of before, breaking in vpon them, the Uese-Gothes then frighted by the example of their neighbours, least the Hunnes should over-run them also, agreed to flie vnto the Romanes for aide; and the more to perswade Valens to releeue them, they being infidels formerly, desired him to send some teachers among them, which might instruct them in the Christian saith. Valens sendeth them Arrian preachers, who taught them heretically to beleeue in Christ. These Uese Gothes thus converted, being outragiously abused by some of the Emperours people, tooke vp weapons against the Romanes; which when Valens vnderstoode, he goeth with an army against them. Loosing the field he flieth, and being glad to betake him to a Cotage, he was so pursued by those Gothes, that they set the house on fire, and burnt both it, and him in it. By the iudgement of God saith Ibidem. Iornandes, that he should be burnt with fire by them, whom seeking the true faith, he had turned aside to perfidiousnesse, and had writhed aside the fire of charity to the fire of hell. The Vese Gothes then being so great a nation, were by the Arrians first cōverted, or perverted to beleeue falsly on Christ. And this is plaine also by Orosius, albeit he vse the name Gothes in general, and without any distinction. The Gothes saith Oros. li. 7. 33. he had by their legates humbly intreated, that Bishops might be sent vnto them, by whom they might learne the rule of the Christian Faith. Valent the Emperour with deadlie pravity did send teachers of the Arrian sect. The Gothes held the instruction
                  
                  of the first faith which they receaved. Ualens had before the rule of the Catholike faith; but leaving it, hee did intangle himselfe vvith the perverse opinion of the Arrians. Therefore by the iust iudgement of God they burned him alive, who by reason of him, when they are deade, are to burne by the fault of their errour. And that is the truth your owne conscience D. H

                     st telleth you, which is manifest by the mincing of your words, the greatest part of those Gothes were Catholike Christians before. Not all, but the greatest part. Therefore some, which is in truth the whole Nation of the Uese Gothes, were first cōverted to Christianity by Arrian Heretikes. And so your owne Proposition that Heretikes cannot convert Infidels, is made voide by your owne example. Nowe wheras you say, that such turning is not to make the converted better thē they were before, we must confesse that if you speake of such as be Heretikes indeede, and not those whom you onely call Heretikes, being Gods good servants, that the gaine thē is but this, that formerly they knew not Christ at all, and now they know him in some sort, although it be not so rightly as they should. If this bee to bee accounted but a little, then your Indian Converts of whom you boast, gaine but a little by you, for you mingle to their handes the doctrine of the Gospell, with many pollutions of vile Idolatry, & most horrible superstition, like to that of the olde Heathens.

               22 HEretiks you say have the Scripturs in some sort. Certainly many of them have the wordes without any difference frō the Orthodoxe. For whereas many of thē sprūg vp in the Greeke Church, they had for the Old Testament the Septuagint in Greeke, & the Newe Testament word for word, in that language wherein it was writen. But they want the sence thereof, which is the sword of the Spirit: for the wordes are but the scabard, and the scabard cannot wound the hartes of the Infidels. What mischiefe with the letter of the text, and their owne perverse interpretation. Heretikes may do to thē, who were formerly vnbeleevers, may bee gathered by that of the Arrians last named, by the Pelagians, by the Donatistes and many other. But those have not the true sence. What is that to vs, vnlesse you can prove that we also want it, which M. Ration.

                  Campian in kindnesse would threape vpon vs. There is not in the world, any fit meanes to come to the right sence of Scripture, which our men doe not frequēt. They seeke into the Original tonges, wherin the booke of God was writen. They conferre translations of all sortes: they lay one text with another, & expound the harder by that which is lesse difficult: they compare circumstances of Antecedents and Consequents: they looke to the Analogy of of faith prescribed in the Creede of the Apostles. They search what the first Councels did establish: they seeke what was the opiniōs of the Fathers concerning textes in question, and refuse not therein to cope with you about the highest points, as the Primacy of your Pope, Transubstantiation or any other vvhatsoever. Yea they looke over the interpretations of your vvriters, to knovve if anie thinge there occurre vvorthy observation: they conferre one learned man vvith another: they praye to the blessed. Trinitie to open and lighten their vnderstanding, and in a vvorde they omitte no meanes, vvhich either Saint De doctr: Chriist l. 3: 4 
                  Augustine or anie other good writer, doth or can prescribe vnto them. Only heere they lay a strawe, that they are not perswaded, that the Bishop of Rome hath all knowledge & iudgment so in Vide Platin, in Paulo: 22

Councell which he shall like to call, is the only determiner of the true meaning of al controversed passages. The Poes all of them are men, and therefore may be deceived; many of them are ignorant men, in comparison of any great Clerk-ship, and many of them haue entertained vnsound opinions, as Liberius and Honorius, and divers Councels haue grosly erred, as that second Synode of Nice, and therefore blame vs not, if we pinne not our salvation, vpon such weake or partiall mens interpretations.
               23 When you report that Heretiks pervert Catholiks, by your owne second Reason before handled, you must meane Papistes by your Catholikes, or no body, and then you are a right good Proctor to speake in their cause. Their matter was bad enough before, and in the telling you make it worse. Your Catholike men (for your words can touch no other) are prōe you say to liberty and loosenesse of life. Would you haue a fee for this pleading? We do not doubt but many of thē are very licentious, great breakers of the Sabaoth, swearers and blasphemers, and much inclined to other viciousnes, whereof if a man would see the spectacle of all spectacles, let him but goe to Rome. And who would forbeare this lasciviousnes, when a pardon from a Pope, and absolution from a Priest, can make all as cleere as it had never beene? But we on the other side teach our people, that these your peccatill

They who haue turned vnto vs, are some of the best and gravest of your sect, and those which bee most vertuous of life, wheras contrarywise, many such as among vs haue beene wanton & toyish people, or deeply touched with suspition of lubricity, haue bin observed to retire thēselues to your shores, as being the fittest harbour for such rotten vessels. It were an easie thing to name many, who leading liues as they do, a mā rightly may say of them, They are fit to be Papists. We doe not envy you such persons, although we could wish that even such would come to the truth, and not amende their former vice with

future idolatry. But while you receiue such, as haue had education otherwise, (howsoever it hath beene neglected by them) you are rather the Partridges, of whom Saint Austen by remembrāce of the words of the Prophet Ier. 17. 11.

ordinarily women in their younger yeares doe breed most children, and it were a monstrous matter as you would insinuate vnto vs, that in old age they shold haue many, yet this maketh nothing for your purpose, nether hath it any affinity with the spouse of Iesus Christ. For women til convenient age breede no childrē at al. And wil you thinke that the Church was ever at that passe? And womē after a time leaue bringing forth altogither: & wheras the age of some of thē hath extended to a hūdred, for the latter halfe therof they haue cōtinued childles. Will your wit serue you to think, that so it is with Christs beloved? Then the later generations of the world should be in a fearful state. You may therfore vnderstand, that the fruitfulnes of the Church, is nether tied to the first age, nor middle age, nor the last age, but to such times as the Lorde hath appointed, who decreeth that at some times there should be balcyons daies, but some other seasons great tempests, in which the Church shal haue a being, but yet be reduced to straights, and to a smaller number. Let any man look into this before the comming of Christ, at which time, the Church was in her youth, for almost 2000. years, being contained in the houses of a very few of the Patriarkes. After Exod. 1. 1. 7 Iacobs comming into Egypt, & the multiplying of the Israelits, her brāches were spread wider. And so did shee continue vpon reasonable tearmes, vntill 1. King. 12 28. Ieroboams time. But when the Princes of Israel vtterly forsook the Lord, & the kings of Iuda also many times turned from the way, both thēselues & their people; were not the good broght to a great paucity? Yet when 2 King. 18

Then d Iosias once more very admirably did put life into thē againe, yet when he was dead, till the cōming of Christ which was well-neere fiue hundred years, there was great scarsity of the faithfull, saving about the time when the

                     r. 2. 1. temple was re-edified. In that state did our Saviour finde it: & then nor many of the Iews were reduced to the faith, but the maine harvest was of the Gentiles. Now if any of the false Priests, either in the daies of Iosias, or of the Apostles, would haue bin of your mind, he might haue argued as you do, that if the Church thē should be said to bring out more children, thē formerly shee had done, shee must haue gone for a mō
                  ster.

So it is since the time of Christ. God hath his appointed seasons which himselfe hath fore-told, somtimes promising that his spouse should flourish, and some other times be obscured. So in the daies of Constantine, the hew of her, not for purity but for extent, was more glorious then vnder all the former Emperours. Vnder Constantius & Iulian her territory was abridged: yet vnder the Theodosij and some other blessed Emperours, shee grew againe, & notwithstāding was no monster. After ward her beauty was dimmed, the authority of Antichrist spreading it selfe in the worlde, as it was before hand Apo. 13. 14 prophecied that it should bee. But God at last did determine, that whē other things should be accomplished, the 2. Thes. 2. 8. 
                  wicked man should be reveiled, as all the worlde may see that in our time he is, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, that is with the preaching of the word, vvhich who doth not se to haue diminished the kingdome of the Pope, and shall abolish with the brightnes of his comming, so that Antichrist albeit much maimed shalbe til the last day of iudgment, & therfore his Ministers must striue to keep his kingdōe vpright, as our Iesuits & Seminary Priests do. But his Babylon in part & by degrees must fall, & so it is already. The Church was ever somwhat, but of late shee is more glorious then in some ages before. What will you therfore say farther?
               5. Shee began in the Apostles time to fructifie in all the world. That we do not deny but the questiō is, whither the Gospell did spread otherwise, then every way, towarde all the coasts of the world, in such sence as formerly I haue shewed. It was towarde the East and West, and North and South, but not in every particular province vnder heaven. The words of Lib. 1. 3. Ireneus are, The Church having gotten this faith, although shee be dispersed through the whole world, doth diligently keepe it. Wherout if you wil gather, that in his time the Church was in all the knowne worlde, you will make vs of Britaine very ancient partakers of the faith, since Euse. Eccl. Histor. 5. 19 Ireneus was the scholler of Polycarpus, whose Maister was Iohn the Evangelist. And this excellentlie fitteth your report of king Lucius & Pope Eleutherius. Tertullian saith thus: Contra Iudaeos c. 4. 
                  The kingdome & name of Christ is every whither extended, is every where beleeved, is embraced by all the nations aboue named, raigneth every where, is every

                  The Church with store of fruitfulnesse doth stretch foorth her bowes into the whole world. The speech of Athanasius is, De incar. nat. verbi.

                     r countries rites, & the wickednesse of their Idols doe now place their hope on Christ, and doe give their names, vnto him, as even by the verie eyes a man may deprehend. Chrysostome writeth thus: In Mat 24 
                  That before the overthrovve of the Cittie of Hierusalem, the Gospell vvas spreade through the vvorlde; heare Paule, Their sounde is gone out into all landes. And Hierome commenting on the same texte, Hier in Matth: 24: 
                  A signe of the Lordes comming is, that the Gospell should bee preached in all the vvorld, that no man may bee excusable, vvhichwe see already fulfilled, or shortlee to bee completed: For I do not thinke that there is any nation remaining, which is ignorant of the name of Christ. And although it hath not had a Preacher, yet by the bordering nations it cannot be ignorant of an opinion of the faith. St, Austen being enquired of, concerning the end of the world, saith that before it come, the Gospel must be preached to al nations, which in as much as he supposed not to be done in his time, he resolveth that the day of iudgment was not presently to follow. Heare himselfe, Epist. 78: 
                  But if by reason of certaine places, vvhich are inaccessible and in hospitall, it is not beleeved to be possible, that the vvorlde should bee traveiled over by the servaunts of GOD, and it shoulde bee faithfullie reported, how many and how great nations there bee yet without the Gospell of Christ; muchlesse doe I suppose, that by the Scriptures it may be comprehended, how longe times there shall be vnto the ende, in as much as in them we doe reade, No man can knowe the times vvhich the Father hath put in his own power. In the second Epistle which you cite out of Saint Austen, the best words that I can finde for your purpose are these, Epist: 80. The Prophet sheweth, h

                  by the prediction of God, the Gospell must bee preached amonge all Nations, and then hee that is Antichrist, must bee so seene. The words of Leo are, Leo serm.

               6 These wordes if you wil vrge for the Primacy of Rome, they doe in substaunce import no more, then that which was decreed in the first Nicene Councell, where the Bishop of Rome was termed Vide Gratian part: 1: Distinct: 99. 3: 
                  Primae sedis Episcopus, and the vvordes poetically serte out by caput pastoralis honoris doe signifie no more. Therefore you goe to farre, vvhen you saye the Bishop of Rome is of Prelates peerelesse Lord, which your selfe may see, since Prosper in cōfuting Pelagius, ioyneth many other Bishops as equals in care with the Pope. But then he reckoneth him vp first, secōdly the Bishops of the East, afterward Hierome. And wheras he termeth Rome the seate of Peter, that was according to atradition much received among the Anciēt, but for the māner therof much differed vpō by all. Besides Prosper lived in the daies of Pope Leo the first, with In vita Leonis Mapni.  whō he was very familiar, & with In vita Prosp. Aquitan. whō he was at Rome, receiving many favours from Leo, and therefore might more easily incline to the opinion of that Pope, who began to arrogate too much to his See, and to magnify it so farre as that his Successours, but especially. Lib. 3. Epist. 76. Gregory woulde not stande to it. This doth often appeare in the vvorkes of Leo, but I vvill cite by name one place, whence Prosper might have the prose of that, which heeturned into verse. Speaking vnto Rome, as concerning Peter & Paule, hee saith thus: Leo Serm. 1. in Nativit. Petr. & Pauli. 
                  These are they who brought thee to this glory, that thou shouldest be a holy natiō, a chose people, a citie of Priests & Kinges, and that by the holie seate of Saint Peter, thou beeing made the
                  
                  head of the worlde, shouldst more largely rule by divine religion, then by earthly dominion. Whē Prosper heard this from Leo as an Orator, he might set it a strain higher as a Poet, who in his amplification would leaue out no word, which might grace the place whō hee would honour. And then he could not see the inconvenience, that afterward did arise by too much magnifying that Episcopal or Patriarchical city. And these things are especially to bee remē
                  bred, if you would vrge his words to that purpose, which in this place principally cōcerneth you, that is to say, that the faith was spread over al the world. Truth it is that much of the world ioyned in the same beliefe with the Clergy & city of Rome, & from thence as being one of the Imperiall residences, they had great light; & many also repaired to the Bishops there, as being for a long time eminent persons, in respect of their holines of life; but if we wil speak exactly, neither did they take their religiō from thence, more then frō Hierusalē, Alexandria & Antioch, neither did, I wil not say the fai

                  h of Rome, but that faith which vvas in Rome, as wel as in other places, possesse the whol world. For first the Loco cita
                     
                        •…
                     o. words of Leo himselfe, do signifie the Christian Religion to be no farther spread over the earth, then the Roman Empire had bin, or little more; & we know that albeit vnder that Empire was much of the old knowne world, yet there was also a very greate deale which never came vnder their subiection. And secondly even at that time, being about 450. years after Christ, neither by the Apostles, nor by their successours had the Gospel bin mēcioned in many parts of the old world, which is it that seemeth here to ly on you to proue. And for this we neede no better testimony then his whom before you cited, S. Austen I meane, who was an old mā living when Prosper was younge. Besides I wil choose no other place, but one of those whom yourselfe cite, which being throughly scanned by the Reader, will evidently shew that you D Hill do take vp your wares at trust. Or else, had you looked and knowne the place your selfe, you would never haue cited that, which so expresly confirmeth the point by mee taught, and over-turneth your assertion, of the Gospell being spreade in all countries of the world, taking countries and Nations, particularly and specially, and strictly as you doe in your discourse.

                     •…
                  enesse of the day of iudgment, had in a former Epistle given reasons out of the holy Scriptures, why that time was not likely to be very shortly: and among other that was one, that the Mat. 24. 14 Gospel of the kingdome had not yet bin preached throughout the whol world. Hesychius is not yet throughly satisfied, & thervpon S. Austen so advertised setteth to him againe in a second Epistle, and farther prosecuting that point of the faith not yet received every where, he vttereth these words: Epistol. 80. 
                  Whereas your Reverence doth thinke that this is already done by the Apostles themselues, I haue proved by certaine arguments that it is not so. For there are with vs, that is to say in Africa; innumerable barbarous nations, among whom that the Gospell is not yet preached, we may everie daie read
                        •…
                      learne, by those who are brought captiues from thence, & are now mingled with the servants of the Romanes. Then he addeth that some of the African people, being lately subiected to the Romanes, had given their names to Christ But those more inward who are vnder no power of the Romanes, are not at al possessed with the Christiā religion, in any of theirs. Yet he saith it was not to be doubted, but that more and more woulde come in, that the Prophecies of the Scripture might bee fulfilled. But that the Western part of the world had the Church thē already. Afterward, looke in what natiōs therfore the Church yet is not, it must be not that atwhich shalbe there must beleeue, for al natiōs are promised, but not all men of all nations. And yet againe, Howe then was this preaching fulfilled by the Apostles, in as much as yet there be nations (which is vnto vs most assured) in whom it lately began, and in whom not as yet it is begun to be fulfilled. Hee sheweth that it was and must be performed in the Apostles and their successours, to the end of the world. And to that purpose hee expoundeth that speech, Psal. 19. 4. 
                  Their sound is gone out into all lands, by the future tense as well as by the time past. He shutteth it vp thus, It is fructifying and growing in all the world, although the Gospell did not yet possesse the whole: but hee did say that it did fructifie in the whole world & increase, that so he might signifie how farre it should come by fructifying and increasing. Novve who doeth not see that the same which this vvorthy Father said in his time, of innumerable nations in Africa not yet called to the faith, might then & many hundreds of years afterwarde, yea in

some till our time, be verified of the Northren partes of Europe, and of the North and East countries of Asia, to say nothing of all the new-discovered lands, toward the North, South & West, of which before I haue spoken. And this togither with Hieroms owne words before mentioned, Or else we see shortly to be fulfilled, 
                  In Mat. 24 doeth shew that the speeches of the auncient Fathers aboue named, are not strictly and precisely to be taken, but that all is to be vnderstoode, for much and many, and for all the generall coasts lying to the East and West and North and South, not including each speciall. And so consequently such a multitude of authorities is but very idly brought: for we wil & ever do grant so much, as any man can in truth wish to bee collected out of them. But what is all this to the purpose, since neither then nor since, they do agree with the polluted doctrine of your Sinagoge: and the faith which olde Rome spreade or mainetained, is no more consonant to this infidelity which our new Rome maintaineth, then an apple is like an oyster.

                  BUt the Protestants per adventure will grant, that the true Church flourished in those dayes, but not afterwardes vntill this age, in which they haue reformed the same: yet is it most manifest that it flourished afterwardes even vntill this our time, no lesse then it and before, if not more: for in Saint Gregory his daies it was spreade all over the worlde, as appeareth by his Epistles to the Bishops of the East, of Afrike, Spaine, France, England, Sicily. And by Saint Bede in cap. 6. Cantic. as also by Saint Bernard, who disputing before Rogerim King of Sicily, avouched that in those daies, the East, all the West, Fraunce, Germany, Englande, Spaniardes, and many barbarous nations obeyed the Bishoppe of Rome.

               8. The Protestāts not fearing that you shal gaine any thing by that which is truth, wil refuse to yeeld you nothing that is true. In the first Church, that is while the Apostles lived, the spouse of Christ for doctrine was most glorious, & for some hundreds of yeares afterwards, her honor flourished not a little: yet so that some pety superstitions began to creepe in heere and there. But about six hundred years after Christ, shee for the outward face did more & more droupe in doctrine. 1. Ioh. 2. 18 Antichrists began to peepe vp in the Apostles time, but then they coulde not properly be called the great Antichrist. And that which was thē, was not so eminently, as that the followers of the Apostles did much obserue it, being then more troubled with persecution or heretiks, then with superstition. In processe of time matters grew to a worse state, evil opiniōs creeping in, & at last the maine 2. Thes. 2. 3 Apostasie followed. But in this Apostasie & very great declining, there were who yeelded not to the time, but kept thēselues vnspotted of the world, especially for mainest points of salvation. And it being thus whē things were at the worst, God in this later age, hath suffred that truth which was more hidden, to illustrate the Christian world again. Yea but you wil proue, that since the Primitiue Church, faith florished more thē before, or at the least it was not diminished vntill our time. You can do wonders Sir, or els your own reason would informe you, that nothing beene added til these lare navigations of the Portingales & Spaniards, Christianity must needs be exceedingly diminished, when the Saracens & Turks for so long space, haue devored so much of Asia, Europa, & Africa, as is or hath bin vnder thē. You are but a simple man for story, & weaker for Cosmography, or els you would not so improbably talke at randon. But any thing serveth your turne. Well, the faith was in Gregories times over all the worlde. How proue you this? Forsooth he wrote Epistles to Bishops of Spaine, France, England, Sicely, yea & of the East, & of Afrike, Ergo the faith was over all the world. A young man of the age of sixteene yeares hath by his diligence learned without booke, the Epistle to Philemō, & that to the Colossians, yea the book of

Ruth and the Prophecy of Aggeus, therefore he can say all the Bible by hart. This is Logike for the Seminaries, but not currant elsewhere. VVhat wrote he into Tartaria, or India, or Manicongo, what to Finland, or Iseland, or a thousand places more? And what saith Bede? In Cantic. 6. 
                  The summe of the citisens of that celestiall countrey doth exceede the measure of our estimation. But this is spoken of all the faithfull that are, were, or ever shall bee in the world? As also that following vpon the texte, Adole scentularum non est numerus, There are saith hee young maidens vvhereof there is no number, because there are sound innumerable cōpantes of Christiā people. Which within seaven lines after he maketh most evident, The vniversall Church which in the same her faithfull members, from the beginning even vnto the ending of the vvorld, from the rising of the Sunne vnto the setting, from the North and the Sea doe praise the name of the Lorde. Doth this shew any extraordinary thing in the time of Beda, or any flourishing of the Church, or more thē that there were faithfull toward al parts of the world? Such is that which was brought touching S. In vita Bernard. L
                        •…
                     . 217: Bernard, who vpō a great schisme in the Church of Rome, betweene Innocentius, and the Antipape Petrus Leonis, being sent for to compose this strife, and to see whether he could winne over to Innocētius, Robert the King of Sicely who stood for Peter, in his Oration saith, that if Peters side were good, they who acknowledged Innocentius for Pope should bee in very ill case: And these hee nameth, Then the Easterne Church shall perish, vvhich at that time coulde comprehend no more but those fewe Christians, vvhich were vvarring in or about Palestina: for the Greeke Churches did not then acknowledge the Popes Iurisdiction, the whole West shall perish, Fraunce shallperish, Germany shall perish, the Spanish and English and the Barbarian kingdomes shall be drowned in the bottome of the Sea. Where he doth not adde these special countries over and aboue the VVest, but signifieth vvhat was meant by that generall name, that is to saye, Fraunce, Germany, Spaine and England vvith some inferiour Kingdomes. So that now if S. Bernard doe say any thing heere, your all the worlde is vvonderfully shrunke in the vvetting. So you strive against the streame, and the farther you goe, the worse you goe.

               9 AS many as be disposed to knowe the Popes strength, harken now to his muster-maister. Al, Italie commeth first as being neerest the Popes nose; then all Spaine is the second legion. But how would it be in these lands, if your Inquisitours did give scope; when doe what you can, with all your bloudy torments, you cannot roote religion out of those places?

Yea and one of those also liable to so evident an exception? This is a good steppe within one hundred of yeeres. In the next age God Almighty may plucke many of these from him also.

               10 I do wōder that being heere in this sweete enumeratiō, you tell vs not out of Contr Machiavel. Lib. 3. 4. Bozius, that of purpose to acknowledge the Popes prerogative, & to sweare obediēce to him, there came out of Africa to Clemēt the 7. the Legates of David the King of the Aethiopiās, & of the Princes of Mexico, from the most remote Kingdōes of the Western Indres: & to Iulius the 2. Embasladors out of Africa frō the king of Mantcōgo: & lately to Gregory the 13. frō lapona in the East Indies, & frō the mighty kings of the Tartars in Asia. Such cūny-catching tricks have bin practised a great while, to magnify the Bishop of Rome. Sometimes there hath bin no body at all: some other times some hūgry cūning slave put into a straunge coate, and two or three beggers after him, (who like rogues have wandred vp & downe, or rūne away frō their countrey, or come frō some great ones as spies) hath bin the Legate or Patriarke, without penny of maintenāce, or ship to bring them, or ought to grace thē.

that Iosippus the Patriarke of Cōstantinople, came to submitte himselfe & his coūtry vnto him: & when Iosippus was deade, an Epistle was published, which he was said to writ in his death bed, signifyīg to al those that were within his Patriarchate, that he approved the doctrin of the Papacy, & acknowledged the Pope to be the Vicar of Christ. This was about the yeer 1439. And to shew his facility in this kind of invention, the same Eugenius provided some to come, not into the coūcel for feare of the pack being discovered, but about the ending of it, who said that they were the Legats of the Patriark of Armeni

                  , who also professed to allow the faith of the Pope, & to approue that which was concluded in the Cōvēticle of Florēce. And because such fine trickes as these shold not grow cleane out of vse, at the last meeting at Trēt, Idem in Session. 21. Pope Pius the 4. had such a Pageāt. For he caused Amulius the Cardinal thē abiding at Rome with him, to write a solemne letter to the Fathers at Trēt, that one Abdisu the Patriarke of the Assiriās in the East, dwelling neere the river Tigris, was by the advise of his people come to Rome the yeare before, accōpanied with some Priests & a Deacon: That the Pope in a full consistory of his Cardinals, had pronounced him to be the Patriarke, & Pastour of that people, & yet not so, but that first he did heare him make the cōfession of his faith, and tooke an othe of him to keepe obedience to the See Apostolike: That departing away, hee desired to have sent him a copy of the Decrees of the Tridentine coūcel, whē all there shold be accōplished. But in the meane while he did testify, that the same faith which is nowe helde in the Church of Rome, had without any variatiō bin among thē, since the daies of the Apostles. All this was divulged after that Abdisu was gone from Rome: to the end that no mā might disprove it. What a wrōg did you to your cause, that you did not put these in, especially since the Iurisdiction of this Patriarke was so large, that hee had vnder him in the Great Turkes dominion, seaven Archbishoprickes; all Metropolitans, & thirteene Bishoprickes; vnder the Sophy of of Persia five Arch-bishoprickes Metropolitane, & thirteene Bishoprickes,

                  yea vnder the dominion of the Portingals in India, three Arch-bishoprickes & one Bishopricke. VVould not this have made a faire shewe when your troupes vvere in the fielde?

you have done your Lord and Maister the Pope wronge, so to oover-skippe these in such a fashion. For our part we must winke at such simple trickes as these bee. Yet these will serve to abuse the children of vnbeleefe, and to gulle many a good silye Papist.
               11 Some kind harted man wil pity me, that whē you leade me such a daunce over all the world, as you doe, I must bee bound to follow you. But let my friends take no care, for if you make not very good hast, I shall bee in some of the places as soone as you. Now we come to the new worlds, whereof our great Grand-fathers never heard, and there we must thinke that Popery springeth by thousands. In what countrey are you Sir, when to make vp your foure quarters, you put Iaponia in the North? It is within lesse then ten degrees of the Tropicke, and more Southward then Spaine, yet with you it must bee North. So Brasilia is South-ward, when yet the vpper parte thereof, is verie neere to the line. If you had named the South Continent for South, and the Iles tovvard the Northerne Pole for North, or else Cathay, vvee had better allovved thereof.

                  The treatise of that worthy Bishop Bartholomeus Cusaus (a Spantards borne) dedicated to the last king of Spaine, hath laide the Spanish proceedings amongst the West Indians, so plainely out in their colours: how many millions of men, womē, & childrē, they haue there murthred: & that with such inhumane barbarensues, & much more thē Phalerical cruelty, as vntil they do repent thē, & are become a new generatiō, all kingdomes & countries in the world are to pray at the least to bee delivered frō thē. By al which it is plain, that the now. dwellers in those parts of America which are said to be Christiā, are few others but Spaniards, who taking thither their wiues & daughters, are much multiplied within these hundred years; the men making no spare to beget children any way, after the Spanish fashion. But as touching the naturals of the Country, first there are few left among them. Secondly those who be there, being in truth no better thē vassals, slaues & drudges to the Spanyards, come on slowly to be baptised. And thirdly they who for feare or fashion come, doe in

hart hate them & their religion, & lacke but opportunity to revolt Quod. 5. 4 frō thē: And this is the propagating of the faith which they haue made in the West Indies. Looke what they haue there Spanish, so much haue they Popish. In the vpper part of Peru they haue somwhat, in the like sort as before I haue shewed; but down toward Magellanes straights, as also in Brasile which properly belongeth to the Portingales, they haue only here & there a castle, or little towne standing on the sea coast; but in the In-land they haue very litle. And in these Castles, looke what devotion their owne people haue, that is papisticall: but the men of those parts, meddle not with them more then they must needes, and vvith their religion not at all.
               13 And for the East Indies thus the matter stādeth. The coūtry of the Portingales being but dry and barren, & the people more then well could be maintained thervpō, Osor. de gest. Emanuel. lib. 1. Henry their king who dyed in the yeare 1460 was willing to imploy some of his mē, to discover by Sea the West side of Afrike down toward the South. And having done somewhat that way, the next king succeeding him but one, that is to say Iohn the son of Alphonsus proceeded yet farther, & opened even to the Promontory or Cape by him called Caput Bonae Spei. King Emanuel the Great Portingale who succeeded Iohn, did sēd out 1497. Vascus Gama with some few ships, to compasse this Cape, & passing toward the East, to salle as far as Calicut in India. Where arriving, & not long after pretending an earnest desire to enter trafficke betweene the two nations, to the inriching of thē both, the Portingales intreated, that for their safeties sake they might haue leaue to build them a little Castle; giving out that they werein much danger otherwise, as partly frō the subiects of the king of Calicut, so especially from the Saracēs who envied their trading into those partes, as preiudicial to their former cōmodity. This Castle they furnished with armour & ordinance, which was then scant knowne in those parts, & therfore was lesse able to be resisted. And to this place every yeare they sent new supplies of mē out of Europe. As they did at Calicut, so proceeding in time, on more and more to the East, they every wher erected their castles & fortresses, the drift wherof the kings of the coūtries at the first did not perceiue: but afterward to their

cost finding howe themselves were annoyed, they desired to remedy it whē it was too late. Besides this, the Portingales finding discord betweene the pety Princes of those partes, they secretely stickled that forward, as between the Kings of Calicut, Cananor, Cochimum & other: & where they saw advantage, they gave open assistāce to one party: by which meanes they wasted the Indians, & procured to thēselves much reputatiō of valure, mē stā

Their incrochments so encreased, that they got into their hands some cities, as Goa, which now they have made their Metropolis, or imperial residence for their Vice-roy; yea they have set footing into some of the Iles of the Moluccoes. And since the time that al these, togither with the crown of Portingale it self, is come into the possessiō of the Spanish King as cheefe Lord, Spanyards have come about frō the West side of America through the South sea, & they giving assistance to the Portingales they betweene thē haue grasped yet more, although still the managing of al about Goa & those coasts, be by Portingales, vnlesse the King of Spaine have prevailed lately so much, as to gaine in that power frō thē But all this was first gottē, & since it is kept by the sword; howsoever that cogging lesuit Contra Chytraeum vt supra.

wanting to them from America, and the Iles beyond it, as the Philippinas, Manilla and some more thereabout, they are stronge in those partes, especially against the attemptes of any small and pety Prince, as they all are who bee in the East Indies; some king having not forty miles over in all his dominion, and no one having very much. But heere the Portingales themselves have little or nothing vp into the lande: but what they have is on the sea coast, and some little way about it: farther they dare not offer. Now the wōderful extent of the Romish faith thus spokē of, cō
                  sisteth in these Portīgals & the Spaniards that come to thē: for as for the naturals of the coūtry, they keep close to their heathenish beleife: some worshipping the Sun, some adoring other Idols of their own.

And wheras boast also is made of the vttermost parts of Afrike, that is much lesse then the Indies; the Spaniards & Portingals having only here & there, a castle stāding vpō a cōveniēt watering place, to vitaile & refresh their sea-faring men passing to & frō the East Indies.

hath appeared in Europe, out of all the company of the Iaponians or other Easterne Indians, who might publikely yeelde an account of his faith, & giue testification by an orderly acknoweledgement of his hope, that he belongeth rightly to the flock of Christ Iesus? It is not sufficient to salvation, for an ignorant persō to be baptised into he cannot tel what, or to be taught by rote to mumble vp a few praiers, wherof he vnderstandeth no part, or to vse a paire of beads with nothing but superstition: or to fal down before a Crucifixe: when the manner of our Redemption, & the course of our Iustification, is no more knowne to him thē to very beasts. And how their care is to instruct their pretended cōverts, in those far distant regions, may well be cōceived by that, which they informe to their own countrymen living there-about, who are much more furnished with wicked devises, leading them the ready high way to dānation, then with ought which belongeth to true Christianity.

This is the propagation of Christianity whereof you speake; the abusing and profaning of the Sacrament of Baptisme, by communicating it to them, whose best profession is ignorance, superstition, idolatry, & wilfull obstinacy against the truth, if it should be reveiled vnto them.

You might if it had pleased you, haue added the rest of the Canaries, and the Azores, as also all that lie neere America, as Cuba and Hispaniola, and many about them; also the Philippinas, and I cannot tell what. But my conceite is that you went no farther, because the Author or Copy which you followed wēt no farther. For I deale plainly with you, I do not hold you gilty of the knowing where al these places be. And yet it were no huge labor, in the reading over of such an Authour, as the Hist. India aut select. Epistol. Iesuit Maffeus is, to take the wordes heere and there as hee relateth

the comming in of the Portingales, or the pretended labours of his felowes. But I smell it to be borrowed from some other man, as your Ratiō, 3. enumeratiō of Heretikes was from Staphilus. In which respect I call to minde howe once on a New-yeares day in the morning, a Parish-Clarke in Oxford brought to the Minister of that Parish, certaine Latin verses as a token for the Newe yeare. The Minister seeing them, before he reade them said, that hee thāked him for his paines, but added that he did not thinke, that he could haue made a Latin verse. The Clarke with an humble smile looking on, did no way deny but that the verses were his owne. But when the other had reade them, he altered his opinion, and tolde him that they were taken out of a Printed booke. It is true indeede saith the Clarke, but Sir, I tooke the paines to write them out for you. Even so much paines have you taken, ignorantly from some ignorant fellowes collections, to write these names out for vs.
               16. I am induced to think so, not only because you have played such pageants before, but much rather because a sober man may wel thinke that if you had known what you did, or had had any true vnderstāding of the matter, you wold never have made such a clatter to so small a purpose. For it may well be supposed that there be no such places, as some are named by you: some other of them are so meane, as that to this day they never could finde place in any mappe whatsoever published to the worlde. Onely they are mentioned by one Iesuite, who cannot lye; and he maketh every meane man a King: if he once parled with a Iesuite he shall want no title. You have reckoned vs vp heere one and forty names, many of them in themselves small base and inferiour things, & if diverse of them be ordinarily tearmed Kingdoms, yet the whol coūtry is not so great as a prety shire in England, & some of the Ilands are as meane as the Ile of Wight is. If you will stand on it that these be kingdomes, yet wee can make you answere, that very many of the Kings of the East coūtry, are Lordes but as over moale-hils, and so it was some thousands of yeeres agone. Gen. 14. 2. You may reade of the King of Sodome, and of the Kinge of Gomorah, as also of the Kinge of Admah, and of the Kinge of Zeboim, and yet all these lived vvithin a small

compasse of ground. For the one and forty names which you note vnto vs, you may reade of Iosu. 12. 9. one and thirty Kinges indeede, with whom Iosuah had to deale, and yet all their dominion was so within Canaan, that the territories of all their regiment, was not so much as England alone, without Scotland ioyned to it. And yet if an ignorant man shoulde heare the names of all those Kinges, as they are set downe by Iosua, he would looke as much about him, as one of your silie Papists doth at those heere in your booke. To let them therefore know how you egregiously abuse them, you haue said as much as if I should speake in this sort. His Maiesty of England hath a great many good subiects (I begin to give the instance in Suffex, because I heare that this Pamphlet is much in request among backward people there) as in the great city of Chichester, in Arundel, in Rye, and in many other good places there about. Also in Sandwich with all the Cinque portes and the liberties of the same, yea in the Iles of Shepy, and Tenet, with other lying at the landes end fast by Essex, yea adde herevnto Hul & New-castle vpon Tine & the strong towne of Barwike. And if a man should tel this to some vnlettered Italian who lyeth a great way hence, he might be made to wonder: but the truth were no very high matter. Thus it is with these places named, which are onely cities, townes or angles standing along the sea coast, vpon the shore of the Indies, and interrupted or intersorted with heathenish dominions, or else they are Ilands in the selfe same quality. And in many of these, if there were some said to be baptised 20. or 40. yeares agone, or if there be now but 5.

(if I should say nothing of that which we teach, but leave it wholy to God and his good blessing) Gentilisme is yet by many degrees more then all the Papisme in the world, and Mahometisme in Barbary, in Turky, in Persia, and in the dominions of all those who hold for that false Prophet doth exceede it. And yet the great propagatiō of Ethnicisme or Saracenisme doth not make them to bee in the right; neither doth the same evince in behalfe of your Romane fancies, but that only must go for truth which hath warrant out of the Scriptures.

                  AND vvorthy it is to bee noted that in no land or countrey vnder heaven, ever was or is any persecution of any moment against Papists (as you terme them) or against the Priestes of that Religion, in regard that they be Papists or Priests made by authority from the Sea of Rome, but onely in England. And in very deede the vvhole vvorld doth wonder, that little England dare and is not ashamed to doe that, which never vvas seene in the vvorld before: for let a Seminary Priest (as they call him) keepe him out of England, and he is safe inough in any region vnder heaven. This I say by the way, for that it grieveth mee at the very hart, to beare that my deare countrey doth persecute that religion which all the vvorld hath ioyfully embraced, or at the least doth vvillingly tollerate, as though shee were wiser then all the world beside is, or ever hath beene, or then al her Elders. Or as though English Protestants knew and saw more, then all the vvhole learned men of Christendome have done for so manie ages together.

If these things doe not sufficiently shew the viperous minde of this lewde Cardinall against his Prince & Country, nothing in the world can manifest it. His dis Englished woolvish desire was, that his naturall place of educatiō, for which the old heathēs would haue lost ten thousand liues, should haue beene in the everlasting bondage of the Spanyard. Our Seculars then commending and excusing him to their powers, are pitifully out: but the error of them, and of some English gentlementravailers was this, that they imagined him in his latter yeares to be altered; when indeede it was nothing else, but that after the yeare 88, his hopes being deluded, and neither Pope nor Spaniarde nor all their adherentes knowing how to remedy or recover that inestimable losse, and incomparable dishonour vnto them, his hart was as good as broken; and he would seeme more desirous to shew all tolerability, to single men of our English nation, that he might haue some grace with thē, since he began to haue so little with the Spanyard. But doubtlesse venime had so putrisied him, that although he were willing to paint himselfe without, he was quite rottē within. And whither for wāt of his prety staruling pensiō frō Spaine, after that illustrious foile, he might not be much humbled in the heigth of his prowd thoughts, it is hard to tel. Such a māner of man was one of the fathers of the Seminary.

And that is the more manifested, by his labouring the Students in Spaine, and at Rome, to consent to the title of the Lady Infanta.

Which I may the rather say, if that be true which Colliar. one of their owne company delivered to me to bee so of his own knowledge, while he was there in D. Barrets time.

And Ibid. p: 29: againe: The Iesuites outrage Princes, as murthering the last Frēch King, & had done our deare Soveraigne sundry times if Gods hand had not beene the stronger.

                  meerely of religion and conscience, but vpon pretence of treason, or attēpts against her Maiesties person or state, or (at the least) vpō the feare therof. But yet more directly he proceedeth, Fol. 31. & 32 
                  I would but aske Fa. Persons (because I know him to be a great Statist) this one question, whither in his conscience he did thinke, there be anie Prince in the world, be he never so Catholike, that should haue within his dominions a kinde of people, amongst whom divers times he should discover matters of treason, and practises against his person, and state, whither he would permit those kinde of people, to liue within his dominions, if he could be otherwise rid of them, & whither he would not make straight lawes, and execute them severely against such offendours, yea and all of that companie and qualitie, rather then he would remaine in anie danger of such secret practises and plots? I thinke Fa. Persons will not for shame denie this. Then the fault is not in the Prince and State for being cautious, but in the Romanists for being pragmaticall in dangerous attēpts. I will ioine to these the testimony of M. Watson who is copious in this point. He saith that the 
                  In the pre face to the Quodlibers. 
                  Seminaries at first, made the Iesuits cause, attempts, intentes, practises and proceedings their owne in every thing: their plots and practises they seemed at first to defende, or at least to winke at. Hence they were intangled by penall laws iustly made against them equally as against the Iesuits. In another Quod. 8. 9 place thus: At the affliction of Catholikes in England hath beene in very deede extraordinary, and many an innocente man lost his life, so also hath the cause thereof beene extraordinary, and so farre beyonde the accustomed occasions of persecutiō givē to any Prince in Christēdome or monarchy, that is, or ever was in the world to this hower as rather it is to be wondered at (all things duely considered) that any one Catholike is left on liue in Englande, then that our persecution hath beene so great: for name one nation (I know none can) vnder heaven, where the subiects (especially if they were Catholikes) ever sought the death of their Soveraigne, (though of a different religion from thē) the conquest of their natiue land, the subversion of the state, the depopulation of the weale publike, the alteration and change of all lawes, customes and orders, and in few the vtter devastation, desolation and destruction of all the ancient inhabitants of their land, &c. Now if this may be saide of the laity of the English Papists, what censure may bee given of the Priests, the vrgers and instigatours of all these things? He speaketh elsewhere more particularly of the Seminary Priests: Quod. 9. 4 
                  Howe can they
                  
                  expect any favor when they are taken? none can deny that their comming over is to increase the number of Catholikes: and that Fa. Persons raigneth, and hath the whole direction at this day for all the missions that are for England. How then (alas) how may her Maiestie and the state conclude against them? What lawes can bee too extreame to keepe them out of the land? Or if they will needes come in, what severity for the execution of lawes against them can bee more then sufficient? Into what gulfe are we plunged? Nay into what an obloquy are we plunged? Nay into what an obliquie must the Catholike Church of Rome grow, in that the execution of Priesthood and treason are now so linked together by the Iesuits in England, as we cannot exhort any to the Catholike faith, but dogmatizando, in so doing, we draw him in effect to rebellion? You see that this writer doth not sumble nor doubly budgen, but delivereth his opiniō roundly. And if any one should except that these be the assertions of private and single men, hee may see a treatise put out by ioint consent of divers Seculars, and written of purpose to cleere the proceedings of the State in England from bloudy cruelty, or vn-advised rigorousnes in cutting of such rotten members. You may iudge the contentes thereof by the Title which is this Edit: An. 1601. 
                  Important considerations, which ought to mooue all true and sounde Catholikes, who are not wholy Iesuited, to acknowledge without all equivocations, ambiguities or shiftings, that the proceedings of her Maiestie and of the State with them, since the beginning of her Highnesse raigne, haue beene both milde and mercifull. By this time if there bee any wit or sence left in you, you may put vp your pipes for complaining of the hard vsage of Priests sent hither from the Seminaries. I haue beene the more large in this argument, partly to stop your clamorous mouth, and partelye to satisfie weake persons either on our or your side; and not least of all to free the honorable Parliamentes and Magistrates taking order against such venimous vermine, from the forged imputations and scandalous defamations in this particular laid against them, & by name of him Supposed to: bee D. Worthington. who falsly reporteth the suffering of sixteene pretended martyrs in one yeere, that is the yeere of Iubily, 1600. Now I follow your steps againe where I left.
               21. When you fall to daring, you shewe your selfe but a simple man. There is one by whose helpe David did dare leape Psa. 18. 29 34. over a

wall, and to attempt with his armes to breake a bow of brasse, by whose protection in a righteous cause, that England which by a diminution you call litle, doth dare to stand against the strongest enemy that it hath. What should hinder it good Sir, to cut of lewde persons, (wherewithall God is well pleased) when the late Queene thereof at her entrance to the Crowne, did not feare all the Potentates in the world, nor the backwardnesse of many of her owne subiectes, nor the combining almost of all her owne Cleargy, but that in the name of God, and in the vndanted confidence of his maintaining of his owne truth, shee did spread the banner of the Gospell, and without discouragement did persist in that resolution till the day of her death, the English fugitiues, and the Irish Male-contents, yea the Pope and Spaniard contriving to the vttermost to impeach it? Why shoulde not this our country dare to doe well, when by the singular favour of God blessing his true religion in it, it hath beene able to repel that invincible Navy, to sacke many of the kings townes in the West Indies, to batter his Groine in Galitia, to march with ensigne displayed almost an hundred miles in the heart of his countrey, to knocke at his gates of Lisbone, to sinke his fleete at Cales, and to burne that towne at pleasure, the Spanyards looking on, & scant offering to strike one blow. The time hath beene that this England which is such a little more in your eie, hath sent Holinshed in Rich. 1 & Edw. 3. & Hen. 5. & 6. a mightie army as farre as to Palestina, hath had two kings prisoners in it at once, and two of her owne Kinges crowned in Paris. And hee is blind who seeth not▪, that at this time it hath decayed no part of her ancient valure or worth; Then do you never feare but it may dare to execute such companions of yours, as will heere disturbe the peace of the Church & Common-wealth. Now that it grieveth your pretty heart that you haue not your will among vs, I doe verily beleeue: and do not you thinke that wolues & beares doe much grieue, that they cannot come at the sheep-folds, but the shepheards will meets with them? As our Luk. 23. 28 Saviour somtime said to the women of Hierusalem, that they should not weep for him, but for themselues and their children, so wee may bid you not to grieue for the evil case of England, but to be sory & weep for your sinnes and most malicious blindnesse, that God without

his more future mercy should giue you over to a reprobate sence so as to fly truth and to hate it, to barke against the light, to cary vndutifull thoughts to your Superiours, and vn-natural to your countrey, where the Lord be praised for it, there is nothing vnhappy, vnlesse it bee that it hath hatched into the world such vipers & such monsters, who care not what become of her, so that Sathā may be king, & Antichrist may be general. How your brethrē are persecuted with plenty ease & aboūdance, not lōg since I told you. The wiser sort of thē cannot but acknowledge, as evē now you heard, that no Prince vnder the heavē, being so zealous in Gods cause, & having sustained such indignities at the hands of many of that factiō, as our late most Christiā Queen had done, would haue proceeded with that mildnes. For the māner of your speech you are now returned to your old custome again. Here is nothing but all'all. How al the world hath embraced your profession, I haue shewed you before. The ancienter part of the Primitiue Church knew almost nothing of it; the latter part of the first 600. years had some weeds cōming vp in it, but the good corn over-topped it. Afterwards it grew faster, but the Greeke Church did balāce it, Mahomatise did emulate it, Gētilisme did infinitly exceed it: in the West, true religiō had faut ours, in thēselues many; but cōpared with the Antichristian troupe but few, & now of late the vizard of her holines is pulled of, & a maine part of Chri stendōe do see that it is but a painted 2. King: 9. 30. Iezabel. That some where it is tolerated we deny not: but it may be where the 2. Sa. 3, 39. sons of Zarvia are too stronge for David, or for other speciall reasons best known to the governours,: but of all likelyhood it is where the embracers of it haue learned to be so temperate, as not to complot for desolatiō of those countries where they are tolerated, & vpō a hope that those who are now perverted by errour, may be converted to truth. But our Princes haue learned to walk in the waies of 2. King: 18 Hezekiah & Iosiah, & know that they are not cōmēded by the holy Ghost, who suffred the high places to stand in their dominions. That Englād while she followeth the prescript of the God of wisdō, should think that she doth more wisely, thē some other who are drūkē with the harlots inchantments, is no greater a fault thē that of Davids was, who could say, By

So shamelesse are men in their improbable detamations, vvhen they once make it their summum bonum, to drawe people after them they care not in what manner. There is no measure of lying: there are no boundes for vntruth, whereof Luther hath vvell tasted, if ever any experimented it for doing GOD good service.
               24 Your scorne at Sir Iohn Calvine may bee easily returned on the best of your side, as Sir William Allen, Sir Robert Bellarmine; but wee must allow you a great deale more then this. Your slaunder against Calvine, you take word for word, from Persons his Cap. 7. Ward-word against Sir Frauncis Hastinges, to which if you please you may reade the aunswere, discovering that odious calumniation. O. E. to N. D: Cap 7: There you may finde, first that Calvine was never Masse-Priest, and therefore that Baals servauntes did falsely obiect Priest-hoode vnto him. Secondly that Bolsecus the authour of this slaunder, did in an open Synode confesse vvith teares, that vvithout any grounde he had laide that slaunder on him. Thirdlye that the tale is not onelye an vniust imputation, but a sottishe and improbable Narration. For first there vvas never any such legall punishment by any lavve decreede; and secondlie no Recorde or testimonie is of any such matter, ever done or suffered by Calvine. You may there also finde how truly that crimination, doth fall on the Romish generation▪ concerning which pointe my meaning is to forbeare you for a while, and nowe to followe you in the present. That then these men should leaue the Papacye, for feare of censure from Popish Magistrates, for that whereof they were no wayes, no not so much as in shevve guiltye, it your foolishe collection: and so much the more absurde, because Calvine by your lying reporte had beene punished alreadye. Anyethinge yvill serve the turne, to keepe this slaunder going. You might rather haue saide in behalfe of Luther, that since hee vvas so esteemed by the vvhole Vniversitie, vvhere hee abode for a great parte

And for Calvine that since for manye yeares, hee lived in so reverende reputation at Geneva, vvhere they are so strict against sinne, that by the testimony of Method. hist: cap. 6: Bodine a Papist, no open wantonnes, no lasciviousnesse is once permitted there, by reason of the austerity of their discipline, and that they haue (as travellours reporte) so sterne a law against lewde malefactours, as is scant to be found in all the worlde againe, that an offendour flying out of any countrey thither, shall there bee subiect to as grievous punishment, as he was in his owne land (if he be convicted of the crime) vnto which severity they are forced, least their citty standing neere the dominion of so many Princes and States, shoulde bee the common receptacle and sanctuary of all fugitiues and runnagates, therefore Iohn Calvin vvas a man of singular honesty of life, and every waye vntouchable in his conversation.

For first Westminster hall is no place for the triall of religion. Secondly your men consent not in such sort as you speake; their agreement is not so generally spred, as a man may see throughout all Bellarmines workes, where almost in every question hee citeth different opinions and iudgements of writers in the Papacy: and many things wherein Romanists agree are but falshood: and you much mistake the number of those who haue and doe oppugne you.

And if any other of our Church do note in breefe, that the Gospell hath taken roote in some large nations, that is to stop the mouth of the clamorous adversary, and to satisfie the weake, as also not least of all to praise God, who so spreadeth the beames of his compassion; but it is not to boast vainely as you ignorantly imagine. Yet who doubteth but a good Christian may ioy in his hart exceedingly, and thankfully expresse it in his tongue, that many who sate in darkenesse may now behold the light, and the sheepefold of Christ is more and more filled. But if we would be too forward, you will plucke vs backe againe. Although it be, say you, in some places of Europe, yet in some other it is not. As who should say your Popery is generall in all. Where I pray you in Greece is your Papistry? It is not in Asia, and Africa, and much lesse in the Indies. The East Indies are part of Asia, if you could think vpon it. By what means your Idolatry came into those Countries, I haue shewed before, and how plentifully there it is. If we would talke idly, as you for the most part doe, we might say that in every place where the Marchants of Holland trade, and haue people residing, our religion is accepted. But since the English Merchants haue companies & houses in Russia, in Constantinople, in Aleppo, in Alexandria sometimes, in Barbary, in Zacynthus, in Venice, and Legorne, we might say after the fashion of your boasting, that our religion is in those parts. But we desire to make no more of things then indeede they are. Yet we tell you for those remote provinces,

that as now one hundred and twenty yeeres agone they knewe not one whit of your faith, so it may please God, before one hundred and twenty yeeres more bee passed (if it so seeme good to his most sacred wisedome) to plant the truth which we reach, in the East & Westerne world, especially if a passage by the North ende of America, or that by Asia beyond Ob may bee opened, vvherein our M.

But the issue of this whole matter must bee leste to the divine providence, which is to bee magnified therefore, if hee adde this blessing to his Church, And if he deny it either there or in any other place, we must not be caried too farre with griefe or pitty, since it doth not please him who is the father of mercie to condescend vnto it. Nowe vvhereas you avouch, that our doctrine is onelye in England, I knovve not vvhither I shoulde put that in your ignoraunces, or rather in your malicious cavils. Truth it is our common prayer booke is vsed onelye by those who are of Englishe allegeaunce, but is there anie pointe of doctrine in it, vvherevnto other Churches reformed, in Europe, doe not condescend? The Catechisme of the Councell of Trent doth differ in words from the Catechisme of Canisius, and both of them from that of M. Vaux: yet you would thinke it a wronge if anye man should tell you that they disagree in pointes of doctrine. So the service of the reformed Congregations in Europe, as in England, Scotland, Fraunce, Switzerland, in the dominion of the Palsgraue, in the Regiments and free cities of Germany which are of the Pallsgraues confession, as also in a good parte of the low Countries, is the same in all pointes of moment, not differing one int

                  thout them, doth not alter ought of faith. The Apostles in that they were Apostles had a kinde of governement, vvhich the Church had not afterward in the very same particular. In the auncient Church, some cities and Countreyes vvere immediately ruled by a Patriarke, Grande Metropolitane, some other by an inferiour Bishoppe vvho was subiected to the greater:

yet they all might agree in the faith. The cheefe at Rome immediately is the Pope, at Millaine for spirituall thinges the Arch-bishoppe, in some places bee but Suffragaines, in some other Iurisdictions, a Deane or Priour by Privilege hath almost Papall auctoritie, vvhich also in times past vvas in the Chauncellours or Vice-chauncellours of our English Vniversities, some fewe thinges beeing excepted and reserved. Yet will you say that these doe differ in religion, or retaine not the same doctrine? Even so it is touching the beleefe of the Protestantes in England, of those which you in spite call Puritaines in Scotland, and of them whome you tearme maliciously, Libertines in Holland and Zeland. They teach no other libertie then what the Galat. 5. 1. Apostle teacheth, and biddeth vs to stande fast in it. For the shewing of your skill, I entreate you to let your scholers heare one pointe of moment, or materiall, vvherein all those Churches which before I named, doe differ. Speake it out, if you can tell what. Touching the Lutheranes in Denmarke and many places of Germany, I haue toulde you before that in one pointe of the Eucharist they disagree from the rest of the Churches, which the LORD in time may sende to bee reconciled; and wee pray vnto him for the same. But your comfort vppon that discorde is small. For as Anthonie sometimes Kinge of Navatre, and father to the most Christian Kinge of Fraunce now raigning, Commenta

Their followers therefore should do well, to ioyne in the greater number against the Pope, till they had ruinated him; and vvhen his heart is broken, they should fall to compound that last single difference. God in his good time may graunt this to bee done, although in the meane while, hee doe exercise his spouse asseemeth good to himselfe.

Hezekiah, & to Cap. 21: 24 Iosiah, and divers other, that having idolatrous parents, they did rather looke to their father which is in heaven, then to flesh and bloud vpon earth? If this instruction of yours should haue gone for currant, the Iewes should scant haue received the doctrine of Christ, but the Gentiles without all question shoulde haue kept them to Iupiter, to Apollo, to Aesculapius, because if they had done otherwise, they had condemned the way of their forefathers. By this rule our auncesters heere in Englande should not haue received baptisme, and the Indians and Iaponians whome you say so fast without booke, should haue worshipped their old Idoles. The complaint which you here make in the person of our predecessours, was made before by Symmachus to the Emperour Valentinian, in the daies of Saint Ambrose, speaking thus in the name of the city Rome, Ambro Epist: lib: 5: 
                  Most noble Princes, you fathers of the Countrey, reverence yet my yeares, vnto which my rootes of devotion haue brought me. I will vse my ceremonies which I received from my grandfathers, for I repent not my selfe of them. I will liue after mine

Ambrose comming afterward to answere all these obiections, teacheth that there is one who in matters of religion, is rather to be beleeued then all the world besides. Concerning God, whom should I rather beleeue then God himselfe? But of this argument I may haue occasion to speake more at large.
               28 Onely now thus much I adde, that if any of our parents offended God, and dyed in damnable ignorance, who woulde say that for their sakes and company, we should thrust our selues into hell' If any of them were right, they will not grudge, that wee should haue more light opened vnto vs, then they in their time saw: even as those holy Iewes vnder the law, fore-seeing what would be vnder the Messias, envyed not to the Apostles and other of that age, the more perfect & liuely knowledge of Christ. But leaving the definition and determining sentence of all, vnto the Lords secret iudgement, into which we must not ofter to prease or intrude, we do hope that many of those who lived in the time of darkenesse, had that mercy shewed vnto them, that

their soules doe rest in peace. Such is Saint Cyprians opinion in the like case, De sacr

If any of them did holde the foundation, concerning their being iustified by the bloud of Christ alone, and besides that did repent of all their errours, knowne and vnknown, committed by ignorance or wilfulnesse, we feare not, but that the same God who gaue vnto them some measure of knowledge, and would require of thē according to that which they had, and not according to that which they had not, would receiue them into the number of his blessed and elect.

But most sufficiently and effectuallie of all other did he speake to this pupose, when hee lay In vita Ber. nard. l. 1. 12. vppon his death-bedde, which place that French noble man doth cite. As it was with this holy person who had an extraordinarie talent of knowledge, so we doe not distrust, but diverse other in their life time, and many at the houre of death did thus apprehend Gods mercy, renouncing all their merites, and the merites of other men, which in our time so stiffe a Papist as Sir Christopher Bloūt did, of vvhome notwithstanding because hee dyed obstinate in other Romishe opinions, wee doe not too much hope, but leave him vnto the censure of the highest Iudge. They which betooke themselues to faith in Christ alone (neither directlie, not indirectly crossing that ground) and also in generall repented, and asked forgiuenesse for all slips knowne and vnknowne, those we iudge to have died in Gods favour. And of this sort we trust that many of our Auncestors and Predecessours were.

And howe infinite are the places, where for many ages togither, the seede never came? there was nōe sowed at all? I here the people are but Ethnicks & infidels, without all sparke of vnderstāding. And where the word is preached, what store is there of heretikes, what multitude of hypocrites, what plenty of worldlings and Atheists, men who delight in security? Are we not put in mind by our Saviour Luk. 17: 26 else-where, that when the Sonne of man is to appeare vpon earth, it shall bee as in the daies of Noe, and in the time of Lot, when the most part of persons shall eate and drinke, and buy and sell, and plant and builde, mary and be maried.

And what can be more true, then that in times past even frō the beginning of the world, there were more Ethnickes, then are Saracens since the daies of Mahomet, or true Christians since Christs time? So Hierome Savanarola who was a learned man, & of an excellent spirit, as appeareth by his workes, (howsoever the Romanists afterward tooke his life away from him) in his booke Lib. 4. c. 7. 
                  De Triumpho Crucis, beeing opposed by a Mahumetane, that Mahomets profession is truth, because so many doe follow it, he answereth first that men are inforced by the sworde so to doe: and secondly that if multitude should beare the palme away, then the devils religion were the best of all other, because he hath possessed incomparablie more, then either Christ or Mahomet. Such a Reason as this is, doth the writer of this Pamphlet heere bring for his Romish doctrine, which if it prove any thing, is most substantiall fo Sathan the great Antichrists graunde maister. For there is not any portion of the habitable world, but the Devil hath his crew in it. In enquiring thē for verity, we should attende, what the solide rule of perfection, that is Gods Sacred word, doth lay out before vs, and not what the hugest multitude directed by humane fancy shal prescribe vnto vs. Exod. 23. 2 
                  Thou shalt not follow a multitude to doe evill. The most walke the worst way. Sapiendum est cum paucis. A wise man, as Seneca telleth vs, Lib. in sapientem non cadere iniuriam cap: 14. 
                  doth not goe that way which the people goeth, but as the Planets doe goe a contrary course to the world so he goeth against the opinion of them all. Thus wee must doe in Divinity, not looke howe many saye, but on what ground it is spoken. If many agree in that which prooveth to be iust, we are to ioy that many give consent to that which is right, but the truth is it which must trie them, and not they inforce a truth. Sounde religion is not the worse when it is but in a fewe: and the multitude which doe hould it, or the wide spreading thereof, cannot make the false to be otherwise.
            
         
         
            
            THE SIXTE REASON. Miracles.
            
               T. HILL.
               TRUE Miracles were never wrought but by them, who were of true religion, for that they are done only by the power of God. Now it is so manifest that there hath bin almost an infinite number of miracles wrought by those who were of the Catholike▪ Romane Religion, and never any by them who were not of that Church-since Christes time, as he who shall deny it, may be proved no lesse impudent & shamelesse, thē he vvho shall deny, that ever there vvas any Masse saide in times past in England, or that ever there were any warres betweene Turkes and Christians, or that there be any such countries as the East and UUest Indies. which thing if a man should deny, would be not of all men bee deemed not onely impudent, but madde, drunken or a foole? And surely the one is no lesse knowne, by all approved writers and eie-witnesses, than the other. For as in the Gospell and in the Actes, the holy Scriptures witnesse, that miracles were wrought by Christ and his Apostles, so doe most approved authours of everie age vntill this daye testifie, and record the continuaunce of the working thereof in the Catholike Romane Church, the which Authours for the most part were eie-witnesses of the saide miracles, as for example.

               1 WHen you first beganne this pety tract of yours, you vndertooke to doe a miracle, and that a strange one too; for it were a miracle of all miracles to proove the rotten ragges of Popery to bee sounde; and therfore we wonder not that in this your processe you speake of miracles. But according to your fashion, at your first setting out you stumble: for wee may well hold those to be true miracles, which are really and verily done, although it be to an evil purpose: And such as these are wrought

by them who are farre of from true religion, as by the Devill, and by some of his instruments, indeed not without Gods permissiō, although speaking properly, it is not by his immediate power. The sorcerers of Pharaodid Exod: 7 1

And this is the opiniō of Bozius a special man of your side, Lib: 2: contr: Machiavel. who telleth vs that Livye reporteth, that it hath rained stones & bloud & flesh. Whervpon he saith we beleeue that these wōders in time past were so frequent, because devils did procure & cause thē: & whē such things did fall out, publike supplicatiōs were made, & general sacrifices, wherby the devils thēselues were worshipped. Then real miracles may be wrought by such, as be not of true religiō, vnles that Sathan may be this religious man, & no differēce is there for this matter before & since Christs time, as wil be seene anōe by example of Antichrist; And if it should be excepted, that diverse of these already specified, may bee saide not to be true, because they are done to an evil end, that is, to deceive & beguile, your late Popish miracles are liable to the same exception, being whē they are at their best, to winne mē not to Christ but to Antichrist.

Anthony the Monke was a meere ignorant man, devoide of all knowledge of letters: he could foretell somethings as Lib 1: 13. Sozomen saith, and did divers wonders as Lib: 1: 17: Socrates hath. Of Hilarion the Heremite, In vita Hilarionis. Hierome reporteth, that by praier he procured a barren woman to haue a childe: healed diverse which were extreamely sicke, & dispossessed some of Divels. Of Martine I find in Lib: 3: 13: Sozomen, that it is beleeved of him, that he raised vp a dead man, and did show other signes not inferiour to the wonders of the Apostles. The tales of zach Lip. pel. in vita Nicolas. Nicolas are, that when he was a sucking childe he knew what it was to fast, and therefore on Wednesdaies and Frydaies would not touch the brest till night. When he was a man he foresaw a tempest at sea, and when it came, with his praier he alayed it. He appeared in a vision to the Emperour by night, and caused him to pardon three innocent men, whom he intended to execute. Saint Austen De civit. Dei li: 22: 8: mentioneth, that at Milaine neere the bodyes of Protasius

and Gervasius, a blinde man was restored to his fighte. That at Carthage when hee himselfe was in the house, Innocentius a chiefe officer of that citty, was by prayer miraculously cured of a very fearefull sore. Also that Innocentia was healed of a canker in her brest, and a Physitian of his gowt by being baptised, with divers such other matters. For the sixth age, that whichis cited out of Dialog: li: 3: ca: 2: & 3: Gregory is, that when Iohn the Pope had rode on the horse of a Noble-woman, the horse would not any more endure a vvoman on his backe, no not his olde mistresse: that the same Iohn had at Constantinople made a blinde man see: and that Agapitus another Pope, caused one who was dumbe and lame, both to speake and go. The wordes of Li: 9. Epi. 58: Gregory about the conversion of Englande, are onlye those in generall, that God by Augustine the Monke had there shewed great miracles, and that hee should not be prowde thereof. Bede Hist: lib: 1: cap: 31: citeth the Epistle of Gregory vnto Augustine, and addeth nothing of his owne. Of Lib: 4: 28: Cuthbert he rehearseth, that whereas sprites did haunt a place, at his comming thither they gaue over: that by prayer he got a well to spring vp in dry grounde, that by his meanes barren lande did grow to plentifull fertilitie.

Another noble man being leprous was clensed by drinking the water, wherwith he had washed his hands at the Masse. At Winchester the towne being on fire, he made a crosse with his hād, & immediatly the flame ceased. He caused a well to spring vp suddainly on the top of a rock. At Lyōs divers eating of the remainder of his meat, were healed of sundry diseases. With his blessing he freed a womā possessed of the Devil. A souldiour that had the dropsie, by putting on the girdle of Anselm was recovered. Bernard: vita. 5. Mal. Malachy was by birth an Irish man, & with the annointing of holy oile he healed a boy that was lunatike. He so restored hearing to a deafe mā, that when he put his fingers into his eares, there seemed to come out of either of thē, a pretty pig. He cured one Michael of a bloudy flixe, by sending him meat frō his table. Some who came to seeke his life were destroyed by lightning. One who spoke ill of him had his tongue eaten vppe with vvormes. Hee vtterlye expelled a Devill, vvhich remooved out of one vvoman into another, and many other such matters hee did. Saint In vita Bernard. l: 1: 10: Bernarde as it is reported of him, laide his hande on his vnckle Galdricke beeing sicke, and bad his fever departe and it did so. He freed of his trouble a man much molested with the Devill, by laying him neere the aultar, and putting the Eucharist vnder his head. At Milaine Lib, 2: 4: he droue a Divell out of a woman.

And he had such a hole in his right side, that a man might see the in most secrets of his hart. But when he was dead, none of the wounds appeared vpon him. Of S. Dominicke, Ibidem. Matthew Paris, In Greg 9. Platina, and Chro. l 4. Genebrard do say, that he was canonized for a Saint, but they name not his speciall miracles. But the Lippeloo in August. 4. abridger of the Legend of Surius, who never faileth at any iumpe, telleth of him that when the Albingenses did cast a booke of his into the fire, it would not burne. And when another hereticke did the same by a paper, wherein Dominicke had written some Divinity, it had the same effect. Moreover that he could fore-tell things, & that he raysed vp divers persons from the dead. As for Idem August. 14: Bonaventure, the same authour saith, that the miracles which vvere done in his life and at, or after his death, were very many, but in good truth he nameth never a one; which hee would not haue spared to do, if he might haue gessed what they were. Idē in vita. S: Petri de Motono: Maij: 19. Celestine before he came to bee Pope, had sometimes Angels of heaven ministring vnto him, and setting before him dainty bankets. After that hee was chosen the Romane Bishop, a boy which vvas lame on both his feete, being set on the Asse whereon Celestine had rode, was presently recovered. After that he had resigned the Popedome, he cured another lame man, but by bestowing his blessing on him. Idē in vita Bernardin: Maij:

Shee had by Christ himselfe imprinted in her body, fiue wounds like those on him at his passion. For the space of eight yeares shee lived without receiving any food. Of Idē in vita Vincentij.

                     : Aprilis. Vincentius it is related, that with making the signe of the Crosse, he could heale such as were sicke. He did prophecy vnto Calixtus the 3, fifty yeares be fore, that he should be Pope. A certaine madde women killed a childe of her owne, cut it in peeces, sodde some part thereof for her husbands dinner, yet he comming in, and setting the peeces togither againe, prayed over them and crossed them, & al stuck togither as before, and the child returned to life as if there had beene no such matter. If we did lacke a miracle in graine, heere were one for the purpose. We must imagine that if they had eate the childe, he would with a whiffe haue fetched him out of their belly againe, and as they should haue beene never the better for it, so the boy should haue beene never the worse. With fifteene loaues he fedde two thousand men: he turned sowre wine making it to be right good to drinke: he cured sixty at several times which were possessed with Devils. With holy water he alayed a most grievous tempest.
               5 The first miracle which is set downe of Id. in vita Ant. a. Maij Antoninus Archbishop of Florence, is that when a maide had broken her hearelace, or some fillet of her head attire, with making the signe of the Crosse, he made it whole.

By denouncing the sentence of excōmunication vpon a white loafe of bread, he made it as black as a cole, and freeing it afterward from the same corse, it returned to be as faire as it was before.

Concerning the Iesuite Franciscus Xavier, Commentar. Anno 1565. Surius saith that in the Indies hee would sende such boyes as were formerly converted to the faith by him, vnto sicke folkes, where when they did but rehearse the Creede, and tell them that they must beleeue in Christ, the patients were healed. Also that his body 15, moneths after he was deade, remained perfectly whole and vncorrupted, yea gaue a most odoriferous smell. But Maffeus the Iesuite and fellow to Xavier wil not Propter bonum sociatatis let him goe so. He therefore Hist: Indic. Lib. 15. reporteth, that when two men in a boate at ses, were by a storme driven away, hee presently made the boate to come againe, close to the ship wherein hee was. That at Goa immediately he made a sicke man whole. That twise in a horrible tempest at sea, dipping his boxe of relikes into the water, hee made all to bee calme. Many other such matters are currant of him among his companions, touching all which I may saye, that of likely-hood they bee not overmuch beleeved of the Pope or Papists themselues, since his Holinesse nor any of his Predecessours, haue bestowed the Sainting of this Xavier on him, neither hath any one of that Society beene Canonized to this day, as the Secular Priests doe rightly obiect against the Iesuites. And yet our age is not debarred from putting those who merit it, into the Calēder or Cataloge of Saints, since the Pope now raigning, evē this Clement the 8. hath bestowed this favour in Icones & vitae Paparum, in Clement. 82. Hiacynthus a Polouian, so that the Romanistes haue one Saint more to pray to, then their fore-fathers had. I trust if you had thought vppon him, you would haue done him the honour, to haue closed vp your miracle-workers with his name & company. Yet it should not haue beene for neede, if so you had done; for already you have insinuated vnto vs many straunge thinges, which I have touched more at large, as being desirous that your Reader shold know, what it is that you do point at. But now my opiniō is, that the examples before named, & produced for the confirmation of the authēticalnes of the Romane Religiō, are very wel worthy our farther examination, and advised consideration.
               
                  
6 The story then of the Christian souldiours, for the generall consent of approoved writers therein, we doe beleeue, & know that God in mercy inclineth much to the Iam. 5: 17. praiers of his good servaunts. That Gregorius Thaumaturgus did something it is likely, but whither he by letters could cast out Devils wee doe not hastily credit. Great learned men recorded many things vpon report of others; and conceiving that all straunge Narrations would breed admiration to the Christian faith, were well contented to accept of them, & deliver them to other without further disquisition. This more grosly appeared in Gregory and Bede: but it had his beginning before their age. Of this sort we esteeme that which is related, of Hilarion, Anthony, Martin, and Nicolas: reports of them, went for records, and small matters were made great. Hierome and the other olde writers coulde not yet fully discover to what head Sathan did bende; (whose meaning was to raise from the rumour of those miracles, innumerable occasions of idolatry, to be committed at or to the relikes of those persons, who were said to doe the wonders) and for that cause these good men were the more facile to apprehende such relations. But if these as also the other mencioned by Saint Austen, should without exception be granted to be true, vvhy doe you Papists challendge them to be yours? Or what doeth this more make for the Synagogue of Rome, then if the Gothes who broke into that citty, in the daies of Sozo. 9 9. Honorius the Emperour should haue arrogated and assumed to themselues, all the Acts of the worthy Consuls, renoumed Dictators, & famous Em perors who in times past had resided there? If it be said that some of these were Monks & Heremits, it is true that they desired vpon a wrong opinion of more holines therein, to liue seiunct from the world, as the Ioseph. de bel. Iudaic. lib. 2. 7. Esseis among the Iewes had done, & all their vsage we can neither commende nor excuse: but they sayde no Masse, sunge no Dirges for the dead, neither did they leade a life any way concurring with these later Antichristian swarmes: distinguish the times, distinguish the persons, put a difference betweene the actions then and nowe, and our Papists may no more challendge to themselues their miracles, then the Senbes and Pharisees might haue strengthned their errours by the olde

wonders of Moses. Those which Saint Austen nameth are not free from their exceptions; that some were reports: some grounded on the narration of one: that frequently those things are attributed to religion, which might be effected naturally, diseases having their periods, and medicines which are applied, somtimes working more then can bee imagined. But for reverent respect to that father, we insist not too far vpon these. Only this we wold haue noted; that he citeth not those as necessary proofs to confirme the faith, (for what Saint Austens opinion is of miracles in that behalfe, yee shall see anone) but to yeeld to the importunity of some, who being vnbeleevers did call for straunge signes & wonders: for the stopping of whose mouthes, he sheweth that their age had some rare matters and events in it, though he cited them not as much making or marring, for the verity of religion. I pray you obserue his wordes in the beginning of the Chapter, De civit. Dor li. 22. 8: 
                  Why say they, are not those miracles now done which you doe preach to haue beene done? I might say, that before the world did beleeue, they were necessarie to this ende that the world might beleeve. But whosoever doth inquire after wonders that he may beleeue, he himselfe is a great wonderment, who beleeveth not, now the worlde doath beleeue. And doth hee not more then once make a difference of the wonders by him mentioned, and the miracles declared in the holy Scripture, confessing that those of his time, were not so knowne, so certaine so, celebrious as the other. For that many of them were done in Citties where scant any one vnderstoode of them. But those in the Apostles age, frequently were performed in the presence of whole multitudes of people.
               7 As for the Dialogues of Gregory, I acknowledge that Hist l: 2: 1: Bede and Tom: 2: li. 5 cap: 24: Freculphus do reckon them as the works of the first and great Gregory. But so are diverse things attributed to Saint Austen which are not his owne, as Adfratres in ereme, where the writer saith of himselfe I

Beda who followed Gregory in time, sawe this yee broke to his hand, and he would needs after, being as plentifull for fabulous narrations at the other. By this time, Popery began to grow more strong, and good men by credulity of vncertaine or vnexamined reports were over-taken. They imagined that such things made for Gods glory, & for the propagating of the Christian faith, when it was indeede cleane contrary; for fables doe disgrace the verity of religion, and the Lord needeth not a lye to set forth his honor. That which is here delivered after the daies of Bede, in such barbarous, such base, such baggage-rotten stuffe, such lying, such legendary, such paltry and shamefull geere, that were there in you but one graine of, salt one mustarde seed of iudgment, you would be ashamed once to name such dung-hill ragges. I doe many times from the bottome of my heart, giue thankes to my Almighty Saviour, as for his Redemption in generall, so that it hath pleased him to keepe me and my fathers house from the gangrene of Popery, that our soules are norted with such shales and huskes, and that our faith is not rested on such weake grounds as these be. For first, who and what manner of persons are these, whom you here mention for the exploiters of your miracles▪ I will except Saint Bernard, and K. Edward the Confessour, who swayed with the darknesse of their times, beleeved and reported things most doubtfull, and had the like for matters of fact reported of them. But besides these I can hardly

name another of these late Saints, but that leaving the final iudg ment of him to Gods secret counsell, we may cal to minde in his behalfe that speech reported to be Saint Austens, Glarean. in pref Annot. in Suetonium. 
                  The bodies of many are adored heere on earth, whose souls are buryed in hell. For what was this Tharasius by you mencioned, but a notable idolater, mainetaining the erection of images in Churches, & the adoration of them? What was Anselme but an hypocrite aboue ten thousand hypocrits, if God gaue him not repentance in the end? He Malmis. de gest. Pontific. lib: 1: would seeme so to hate sinne, that he oftentimes vvoulde wish, that he rather might be in hell without sinne, then in heaven having offended and transgressed: vvhich speech is of that quality, that it can hardly be decided, whither there bee more ignorance or hypocrisie in it. He once Ibidem. reported, that after that he had entred a Monkish life, he was never so angry, that he gaue any one a reproachful word but once. That he never spake any speech but one, the memory wherof did trouble his consciēce. At supper once remēbring that he had eatē a raw herring, he smote himselfe on the brest deepely sighing for that crime, that cōtrary to the law he had eatē raw meat. But whē one sitting by him, answered that the salt had consumed the rawnes of the herring, Thou hast healed me saith he, that I need not be tormēted with the memory of this sinne. Of this hypocriticall quality vvas Francis the father of the Frāciscane Friers, & one of your Saints. His commendation was, that when the Pope Matt Par in Henr: 3: scorned him as a ragged and torne companion, & when he presumed to speake to him, badde him go tumble him with the hogges, hee went his waies & did so indeed: & comming againe al be

But Pope Alexander found him a man for his purpose, and knew that it would be more profitable for the Papacy, if multitudes might bee gulled with the opinion of his sanctitie, and therefore he Canonized him by his Diabolical authoritye, & made him Saint Thomas of Canterbury. A many such Saints there bee, with whose soules a sober man would bee very vnwilling at all adventure to change his soule, least his reward should be eternall torment.
               8 Secondly out of what Records are the miracles cited, which we do now debate? Forsooth out of the Legend, the Legēdary, the golden Legend, called the lives of the Saintes.

Your Papistes have good stomakes that can digest such colde iron. You wil say perhaps I slaunder you: for your water came out of another well. The reverend Father Laurentius Surius the Carthusian hath supervised all the reportes vvhich formerlye vvere of the Saintes, and nowe hee hath compiled them into a verie large storie, and thence you haue your citations, or from Res gest. illustomarryrum. Lippeloo, who hath revewed, digested, and abbreviated the huge volumes of Surius, and these sometimes

do name the Authours in particular, frō whō they haue their relatiōs. Well, the matter thē is this: these two haue it out of the Legends, & you take in frō thē. But they haue left out many things which the Legendes reported. True: the lyes were so manye, that they filled too many bookes. They divided then everie thousand, and kepte fiue or sixe hundred of them which were most significant, and for their purpose. Or they abridged them: but as nowe they bee, there is none but a childe, a simple woman, a Papist, or a blockish brutish body, which will lende any credite to them. Drosse can be nought but drosse; and doe what you will, dregges will be no better then dreges.

Now although in the Actes of the Apostles (where for the advauncement of our Saviours glorie, such a matter would not have beene concealed) there be not one word of this, no nor yet in any other good writer, yet this man is dropped or slipped in to be a Saint, and he is to be praied to, and his holy-day is, to be kept of those that wil, on the fifteenth of March, and Surius with his abbreviatour

I name this one for a tast, but he who pleaseth may finde a hundred such, if hee will take paines to reade the Lives of the Saints, as they are set downe by the foreinamed Authours. Such trimme men are your miracle-workers, and therefore your miracles must needes also be of an excellent sute.

                   former place doth only mention that the truth of Christian religion De vtilitat. credend: cap. 17. is cōfirmed by miracles. But you therin abuse your Reader notably. For he speaketh of miracles past, & that in Christs time, and not of any which were to come, or like to cōtinue in the church. The words to which hee alludeth are more plaine in the chapter next before going, where in a larger sort he hādleth that argumēt. Such

It is true, meaning of the time of Christ, and his Apostles: but he doth not saye it was continued, and must be continued vnto the worldes end, much lesse doth he affirme that it must be as a necessary argumēt of truth. So you haue gained much by these two places, even as you haue done by the whole ranke of your wōders: wherof such as appertaine to you, that is the late Legēdary inventiōs, are many indeed, but not infinite, & are so far from being glorious, that they are plainely cōtemptible & ridiculous, fit for your vn-Catholike Romane strūpet, whose throne must be supported with lies, and variety of falshoods.

                  Quifacilis credit, facilis quoque fallitur, He who lightly beleeveth, is easily deceived. You are strongly conceited, & you haue a boisteous imagination, frō which the sooner you fly, the safer you wil stand. The De Trin. lib. 1: cap. 2: words of Richard de S. Victore, are not spoken of your fabulous and instly questionable wonders, but of such signes as gaue evidence to the first preaching of the Gospell, & were wrought by Christ and his disciples; which were so true & so strange, as that they could be wrought by none but by the power of God, and therefore we may beleeve the doctrine both of the Trinity and other matters, which they confirmed; and not be deceived at all. Yet this addeth no credit to your forgeries & illusions, neither convinceth that now we are to depēd on miracles. That we do not take on vs to be able to work any, we do most willingly acknowledg. We know that those daies are past: although God do not so restraine himselfe, but that (the praiers of his servants interceding) he sometimes suffereth strange things to be done. But we cānot

presume vpō it; since we haue no warrant for it, out of the word of God. And who is there I pray you in the whole Hierarchy of your Papacy, who dare professedly assume that gifte vnto him? Dareth your Pope the ministerial head of al your holines, dare your Cardinals, your Bishops, your Friers, your Priestes? Long agone the Decretal. lib. 5. tit. 35. cap. 3. Templars in Livonia did enforce the poore people to this; that if any of thē were accused of any crime, to purge themselues they shold go bare-footed, over certaine redde hot irons, & if they were burnt at all, then they were helde for guilty. But some newly cōverted to the faith, cōplained of this to the Pope Honorius the 3. & he inhibited that any more such triall should be made, calling it a thing forbidden, a greevance, & that wherin God was tempted. The like may be said of any, who presūptuously should professe to attēpt any strange & miraculous matter; it is but a tempting of God, even by the iudgmēt of Isa: 7: 12. Ahaz nowe long agone, who beeing but an evil man, yet was so faire tightly instructed. Yet that good hypocrite your S. Dominicke, going to dispute against the Ioh. B

And in Italy and Spaine there bee some possessed vvith spirits, that the Exorcistes may have worke to shewe themselues vpon. Such artificers can haue counterfeits of their owne choosing, and taught for the purpose. These keepe in ure the olde order of stage-playes, to have a Devill and a foole in them alwaies. But it is no marveile if our Priestes familiars, being put in

by one sleight into their abused patients, can be plucked out by another. They lose nothing by these trickes. And if there should be a Devill indeede in any, and he should bee so sullen as that with all their crossing, reliques, and holy water hee woulde not out, yet they will saue their stake still, the Rhemistes being at hand with this salve, that In Matth▪ 17. 19: 
                  it is not in the povver of their Exercistes to cast our Devilles vvhen they vvill. They must misse of their purpose sometimes. And if any Protestant be neere, they will saie, It is the better also, that the Spirit for that time will not out: for if then hee should bee eiected out of the possessed, hee vvoulde presently get him into the heretike, and then they were never the neere. Better keepe him where he is, among his olde acquaintance.

Moreover that he attempted to raise to life a knise-man of the Emperours, who was deade; but missed of his purpose. Greg. Turon. histor. Fran. lib. 2. cap. 3: Cirola the Arrian Bishop seing Eusebius and some other Bishops which were Orthodoxe, to do strange things, whereby the people had them in admiration, & accepted of their doctrine, devised to procure to himselfe and his Arrianisme, credit by a counterfeit miracle. Hee therfore gaue one 50. peeces of gold, to pretend that he had bin blind, & to say that by his praier he was restored to his sight. But when Cirola was to passe by, & expected that this pageāt should be plaied, the counterfeit cranke who could see well before, was indeed striken with blindnes, and could by no meanes be cured of it by the Arrian; but by the Orthodoxe Bishops praying for him, he had his sight restored. Where-vpon exclaming vpon Cirola he confessed the whole intended fraude. Thus the Authour reporteth it: but we dare not be to nimble in beleeving his Narratiōs in this kinde, since he was too great a relater, & admirer of the miracles of holy mē, having writtē

Also there is speech of a bottle of oyle throwne by the same Donatistes in disgrace out of a windowe, which falling on the stones did not breake. But if these be allowed, this is nothing to your matter: for these are rather wonders shewed by God against them, then any attempts of theirs to shew miracles, and receiving a disgrace by being frustrated in them.

Other men vvho know your tricket, will pitty you, or laugh at you, and so let you goe.
               11 Your conclusiō is like your premisses: they are foolish who beleeue these new fellows who can doe nothing (indeede you might haue said who make profession to doe nothing of miraculous actions) & leaue Popery so bolstred vp with miracles. Your Maister Bristow from whose fifth and sixth Motiue, yet much shrunke and contracted, you borrowe your sixth Reason, to shewe the straungenesse of Miracles doeth playe the good fellovve vvith vs, and giveth vs an instaunce of one in our owne age; that a Bristowe Motiv. 5. woman called Margaret Iesope was contracted to a Dutch man in London, and by him begotten with childe before they were marryed.

In remembrance of this wonder, her staffe or Crouch was hanged vp, neere the place of the Blessed Sacrament of Miracle, and her healing was proclaimed every where in the pulpit. Can any man chuse but beleeue that Popery is truth, when hee heareth this tale, the grace whereof is so excellent, that he spendeth eight whole leaues in delivering it, making it vp so much, as will serue a Popish womā to read in an after

                  noone, allowing her a little liberty to thinke how shee may say it without booke, to tell it to her friends or sisters. And some oddes may bee laide that it will cost her a dry droppe or two, of some trickling teares also. It may be here noted, that the subiect of the miracle, this gentle Iesope was an honest woman, being with childe before that shee vvas marryed. Also that M. Bristow talking in his grosse ignorance, of her suing the Dutch man for a maime (which is a iesting phrase in England, but no action for that particular being liable in the Civill or Common Law) is a fit man to determine of Kings and Queenes, of the excommunication of Pius the 5. of the good cause of the Rebels in the North, Ann. 1569. where he proclaimeth them to be Martyrs. Thirdly it is no newes to heare that Motiv. 15: a harlot being put to her shifts, should be a counterfeit cranke, & to cover her other baggage like tricks, should be willing to bee talked of as one vpon whom a miracle was shewed. In the time of the olde pilgrimages there were a thousande of these prankes played. And I could name where a woman lately dwelt, vvho (as her honest neighbours reported) by her vertuous life came to that state, that to say no worse of it, the French overcame the English. Shee laboured to conceale it, but being forced by infirmity to go with a paire of crowches, shee gaue out that she knew not how shee was taken in her limmes. Afterward vnder a colour of going to the Bathe, or some other such place, shee with-drew her selfe till by some surgeon like skil shee was reformed againe. Yet comming home she would not leaue her crowches, but professed that her weakenes grew on her more and more. At length when the time was come, which best fitted her purpose, on a Sū
                  day or holy-day when the street had many people in it, who beheld

her going along, shee goeth with her Crowches to a brook running on one side of the towne, and there for an howre and more, shee sitteth washing her feete, telling such of her acquaintance as passed by, that she felt her strength more and more increasing, according to a dreame vvhich shee had dreamed the night before. But the issue was, shee left her crowches, and came home as well as shee desired. Being asked of it, shee hath not feared to sweare, that so strangly shee was cured as I haue reported, and some wise folkes beleeue it. You may be one of these if you will: and you may recorde this woman for her straunge vision. This may well fit Bristowes Narration concerning Margaret Iesope. Touching which relation, so reported, so magnified, so beleeved, to the great praise of the miracles done at Bruxelles, because I do desire that my much-abused country men should take notice, how they are bobbed by the fraude of their Priests, and what the iuggling of such good fellowes is, I thinke it not amisse to let them vnderstād, that within Ann 1581: fevē years after this fore-named wonder, the Senate of Bruxelles did discover the whole legerdemaine of the miracles, said and blazed abroad to be ordinary with them, and after due examination did put foorth to the view of the world an Edict or Proclamation therevpon.

For some scores of yeeres togither, this place was famous for Popish miracles, and so many strange things were heere saide to be done, that of all the places in Europe, Bristow chose this to fetch his wonder from, for the confirmation of Popish doctrine, and now you see by a most authentical Record, what it prooveth to be. You Seminary Priests that can blush, blush at this, and at the ill fortune of Margaret Iesopes miracle.
               12 HEere to turne vnto the Christian Reader; if our Romanistes had not resolved to say any thing, which might make a shew & flourish without al substance, who would in our age bring this Reason of miracles, to decide or determine which is the true faith? It is certaine that whē our blessed Saviour came first into the world, for the ratifying of his dotrine which seemed strang, & for the testifying of his divine power, he wrought many wonders. And yet he sharpely Matth. 12. 39. Ioh. 4: 48: cap.

But for the planting of his Church at first, he gaue also to the Apostles and some disciples that power, that they might worke wonders; adding concerning that time, that these 
                  Marc. 16. 17.

Yet that soone afterward, the ordinary exercise of these was extinguished, wee have verie ample testimonie. Eccle. hist. lib. 5. 3. & 7. Eusebius sheweth that in the daies of Irenaeus, which was soone after the Apostles, there were yet done some miracles, implying by many things in his Narration, that very soone after, that gifte did cease. I noted before, the words of S. Austen, De civit. Dei. l▪ 22. 8. 
                  Why are not those miracles (saie they) now done, which you report to haue beene done? Hee answereth that they were necessary till the world beleeved: but now faith being spred in the world, hee himselfe is no better then a vvonder or a monster, vvho vvill not beleeve vvithout seeing vvonders. And in another De vera Religion: cap. 25. place thus, Since the Catholike Church is diffused through
                  
                  the whole world and grounded, neither are those miraculous thinges permitted to indure vntill our times, least the mind should alwaies seeke visible things, & by the custom of thē, mankind should waxe cold, at the newe appeerance whereof it was all on fire &c. Truth it is, that in his Lib. 1: 10▪
                   
                  Retractations, he expoundeth himselfe what he meant by this passage, It is true in deede, for even vntill novve, when the hand is laide on them vvhich are baptised, they doe not so receive the holy Ghost, that they speake vvith the tongues of all nations, neither novve are the sicke bealed by the shadovve of the preachers of CHRIST passing by, and if any other such thinges vvere then done, vvhich it is manifest that aftervvardes they ceased. But that vvhich I saide is not so to bee vnderstoode, that novve no miracles shoulde bee beleeved to bee done in the name of CHRIST. For hee saith that himselfe sawe a blinde man recover his sight, at the bodyes of the Martyrs at Milaine; and some other matters, hee saith, were done; alluding of likelyhood to those many wonders spoken of by him in the De civit: Dei l: 22: 8. place formerly mentioned. And whereas hee had saide else-where, Why, 
                  De vtilitat: credendi: cap. 16: 
                  wilt thou say, are not these things done now? Because they would not move, vnlesse they were wonderfull. But if they were common, they would not bee wonderfull, he expoundeth that also in the same booke of Retractations thus, Lib: 1: 14: 
                  And this I saide, because not so great ones, nor all are done now, not because that none are done even now.
               
               13 Saint Austen acknowledgeth both heere & else-where, that some strange things were done in his age, but not such great ones as formerly, not so often, not by an ordinary operation, but sometimes whē God was pleased to permit it; which is notwithstāding so to be taken, that the assured faith of no mā before hād could lead him vnto it. And that such matters were done about that age, or a little before, we have more witnes. Iustine In quaest. ad

fellowes. Haeres. 51: Epiphanius telleth of miracles, which we dare not be too bold to beleeue, as that there were divers places, whom also he nameth, where somtimes in the yeare, the water in their wels and rivers was wonderfully turned into wine, in remembraunce of that which Iesus had done at Cana in Galile. May wee not by this example feare, that diverse of the gravest fathers of the Church, goe a little too farre in their reportes as Eccl. Hist. Lib. 7. 14. Eusebius did also in telling of the image of the woman cured of an issue of bloud by CHRIST, at the foote of which as he said, grew three hundred yeares afterward, an herbe, which when it came vp so high as to the garment of the woman', it vvas of force to cure any kinde of disease. Which narration is shrewdly censured by In metho. Hist. cap. 4. Bodine, as detracting credite from Eusebius in other matters. But be it thus: that rarely there were done some strang things, for the space of some hundreds years after Christs ascension. Yet this was no set, certaine, or ordinary vocation of vvorking miracles, and therefore is very little to be accounted of, for the purpose here in hand. Heare Gregory on this point; Mor. li. 27. 11. 
                  What marveile is it, if the faith being propagated, miracles be not oft done, since even the very Apostles in many which were already faithfull did not doe them? This place being vndoubtedly Gregories, may make the freer exception to be taken to the books surmised to be his Dialogues▪ for here he telleth vs that miracles are not often done, & there if all should be true, nothing can be more common. Notwithstanding hence it is apparant, that in his age there was a discontinuance of the practise of miracles; no man was noted for a common doer of them; none assumed that power vnto him, and therefore since now a thousand yeares are passed from his time, what vndoubted reckoning can at this time be made of them? Nay, what argument could be drawne from them, in the daies of Saint Austen? Might that which our adversaries vrge, that those who did miracles had the Catholike faith? How evidently, how copiously, how forcibly doth Saint Austen overthrow all that Reason? There were Donatists & other heretikes, who did vrge miracles of their side. Doth Saint Austen therefore yeeld therevpon that their doctrine was Orthodoxe? No: but thus he saith, De vnitat

                     se miracles, or because men at the memories of our Martyrs do pray and are heard, &c. Away with these either fictions of lying men, or monstrosities of deceiving spirites. For either those thinges are not true which are saide, or if there bee done some miracles of heretikes, wee ought the more to take heed, because when the Lorde had saide that there shoulde bee some deceivers, who by doing many signes shoulde deceiue the very elect if it were possible, hee did adde cō
                     mending it vehemently and saide, Beholde I haue foretolde it vnto you. And not long afterward, But they are hearde either of seducing spirites, which yet doe nothing vnlesse they bee permitted, God on high and vnspeakeably iudging what is to be attributed to every one: or else of God himselfe, either for a paine of their wickednesse, or for the comfort of their miserie, or for a warning to seeke everlasting salvation. But no man commeth to salvation and everlasting life, but hee who hath Christ for the beade. And yet farther in the same treatise, Whatsoever thinges of this quality are done in the Catholike Church, therefore they are to bee approoved, because they are done in the Catholike Church, but the Catholike Church it selfe is not therefore manifested, because these thinges are done in it. So that now the true faith doth giue countenaunce to the miracle, and not the miracle credit the faith; which if our Papistes were not possessed with a spirit of giddinesse, they must needes confesse. And the same father in another place, beeing haunted as it should seeme with obiections of miracles, and as surfeted on them, and loathing them faith, Tract. 13. in Iohan.

               14 No reader can be so simple, but in pervsing these places he may perceiue, that the warrant and ground of Saint Augustines words, and the waight of his Reasons is drawne out of the holy Scriptures, which are plentifull in that point. For besides that of Deu: 13: 1: Deutronomy, and the other place of S. Mat: 7: 22: Matthew before cited, how frequently are we put in minde that seducers and false Christs, and Antichrist and the beast shal come with great signes and wonders? Ca. 24 24: 
                  There shall arise saith our Saviour false Christs and
                  
                  false Prophets, and shall shew great signes and wonders, so that if it were possible, they should deceiue the very elect. Behold I haue tolde you before. Here is a watch-word added, to the ende that we should not be negligēt in discerning this. In like sort Saint Paule remembreth vs that the 
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     : The: 2: 9  
                  comming of that sonne of perdition, is by the working of Sathan with all power and signes, and lying wonders, And in all deceiueablenesse of vnrighteousnesse amonge them that perish, because they received not the loue of the truth, that they might be saved. So Saint Iohn saith of the second beast, Apoc. 13: 13: 14: 
                  He did great wonders, so that hee made fire to come downe from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceived them that dwell on the earth by the signes, which were permitted to him to doe in the sight of the beast. Afterward we heare againe, that Ca: 16: 13: 
                  three vncleane spirites like frogges come out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false Prophet, for they are the spirits of Divels working miracles. And lastly we finde that Ca▪ 19: 20: 
                  the beast was taken, and with him that false Prophet that wrought miracles before him, whereby he deceived them that received the beasts marke. From all which is it not much fitter and surer to conclude, that our Papists doe take on them to be able to doe miracles, therefore the beast is their maister, they are cousens to the false Prophet, they are brethren to the frogges, promoted by the spirits of Devils? If any grace were remaining, they would tremble at this connexion, and hast away from Babylon, least they perish there with the harlot. But to collect from their wonders, that they are the true Church of God, is most sencelesse and inconsequent. I haue shewed before out of Saint Austen, that the Divell worketh miracles. And profane stories are ful of such reports, how Sathan did abuse men, so to winne them to his service, or to continue them in it. The Liv. lib. 29: men of Loeri having war with the Crotonienses, were desirous to remooue into their citty, some store of mony which was laide vp in Proserpinas temple standing in their fields. In the night time there was heard a voice out of the Chappel, that they should let it alone there: the Goddesse would defend her owne temples; wher-vpon not daring to stirre it, they yet thought good to compasse the Chappel with a wall. But when their building was brought to a pretty height, it fell all downe to the ground. Were it here a good conclusion

to inferre, that the religion of Proserpina or the Locrenses was right, for these strange wonders sake? Yet this is the same which our Romanists do vrge, or else they do nothing. There is an approved Tacit lib: 4: Hustor: authour who witnesseth of Vespasian, that when he was to take the Empire vpon him, he did divers prodigious & miraculous matters, openly and in fight of all. Yea what can bee more wonderful, then that which Philostrat li

                      4: 6: & 16 Apollonius acted, as Philostratus writing his life reported of him? For one of his deeds was, that he cast out a Devill, and another that he raised to life a maiden which was dead. And to cast out Devils, & to quicken the dead, are worthyly reputed amōgst the highest miracles. Where, who is so grosse as to inferre, that the doctrin of these persōs was true, for their wonders sake? Neither doth it serue the turne, to put this difference or disparity, that the miracles now in questiō must be done in the name of Christ, which was not in those of the Gentiles; for evē the same which are by Christ reiected, are there said to be done in Mat: 7. 22 his name; & who is ignorant that in Christiā coū
                  treies, such rare effects as are brought about, by witches, negromancers, coniurers & the like, who somtimes do strang exploits, are operated by vsing the name of al the persōs of the holy Trinity, by sentences of Scripture, & other words in thēselues good but wickedly applyed?
               15 These reasons as they do weaken & extenuate the maine strength of al miracles lately done, so the cōsideratiō of the qualities of Popish miracles do vtterly overthrow thē. For not the 40 or scant the 100. of thē was true: divers were wrought with legerdemain: very many were most ridiculous, & no better with wise folks thē things to make sport, albeit they were admired by the simple & superstitious. That worthy man Ludovicus Vives saw this wel inough, whē he spake so feelingly of this case.

You may heere once againe call to mind the Proclamation of Bruxelles before spoken of. If the miracles so extolled in the Romish Church, were examined after the notes & marks heere proposed by Vives, how poore, how contēptible, how scornful would they be? Let vs see some few examples, and those not tosled vp and downe with rumours, but beleeved and received, as commended vnto vs by authours of good note. Hoveden part. 2. In or neere Sicilia, the fire did breake out of the mountaine Gibel, which is a matter long agone written cōcerning the hill Aetna. The people of the countrey being frighted at it, doe flye to the tombe of S. Agatha, & taking her veile frō thence, do with it so beate back the fire into the sea, that it dried vp the sea almost for the spice of a mile, & did halfe scorch or burne the fishes, so that yet such fishes do remaine halfe broiled, and are called S. Agathas fishes. You must thinke that it is some commodity to the countrey, in saving them fewel, who eate of the fishes, in as much as they are halfe broiled to their handes. You must not aske whether if all the water vvere so gone, that the fishe lying drye vvas burnte, the people came and tosled them forvvard into the sea, or else they laye there till the tyde came vp againe, that they lived so longe after. Nor whether there be yet any of the same fishe remaining: for were it not time, that they were spent? And yet as men say, fish is long lived. But howsoever you must not sift a miracle too far, as it is no good manners too much to examine a friēds tale. Ibidem. The same Authour hath another Narration cōcerning Thomas Becket, that he never drāke any thing but water, & on a time being at boorde with Pope Alexander, the Pope would needs tast of his cup. There least the sanctity & abstemiousnes of the holy mā should be discovered, God so provided that Alexander could finde nothing but wine: but when Becket came to pledge him in the same cup, it was turned backe againe into water. You must beleeve that although the Pope found it to be wine, yet Thomas Becket drunke nothing but water. And because it shold be known that he was as miraculous

in his meate, as he was in his drinke, Quod. lib. 8: 7. one of our Secular Priestes in great earnest telleth vs, that on a S. Markes day in Rome, he had a Capon whereon he was eating turned into a Carpe. Some haue talked of men, that could or would haue gone invisible. Perhaps some body wil ignorantly say that it was Frier Bacon. No, it was S. Bartholomew, as Past 3: quaest: 54. a

You wil hope that S. Bartholomew was an honest man, or else nowe and then hee might haue done ill feates.
               16 That S. Francis the Patriarke of the Franciscanes was a maister of miracles, we are not now to learne: but see whether hee brought not vp his scholers vnto it also.

Afterward rubbing his shin-bone, and scratching where it itched, that spider came whole out of his legge, and did him no hurte. And because such wonders as these bee, must never cease in the Church of Rome, but our age must haue her part, our Iesuites who do as much honour the foūder of their Society Ignatius Loiola, as the Franciscanes do S. Francis, will informe you that Ignatius was not without his miracles, for whē

And that was because he wold not haue the people think too well of him. And in as much as mention is heere made of Caesar Baronius, I vvill adde one thing more, which the said Lib. 1. An. 1550: Cardinall delivered vpon his othe, concerning the same Philip his founder; for the said Baronius was one of his company and society. In the yeere 1550, now more then fiftie yeeres agone, Philip who (in the darke of the night, vvhen all men are even buried in sleepe, so that the lefte hande coulde not knovve vvhat the the right hande did) did vse to visite needy persons, vvent in the nighte time to cary breade to a poore gentle-man. Heere by the Devils meanes, vvhile hee sought to avoide a carte comming hastily vppon him, hee fell into a verie deepe ditch, but Gods helpe beeing at hande, in his falling he vvas presently caught of an Angell, by the heare of the heade miraculouslye, and beeing nothing hurte, hee vvas returned out safe by the Angell. This did Baronius (who vvas not there, and coulde haue it but by the reporte of Nerius) svveare absolutely to bee true; vvhereby vvee may easilie gesse, that the same Cardinall in his vvritinges maketh no greate conscience, to saye thinges true or false, vvhen hee maketh no bones to svveare matters so vnlikely. Hee who list to see more of the venerable miracles in Popery, let him reade Henrie Stephanus in his French Cap: 39:

Are not our Country-men, and Country-women blessed, when after so long light of the Gospell, they chuse to feede themselues fat with legions of such wonders, and holde it a high part of their profession to beleeve such things as these are? We reade of some whom God doth so giue over to the spirit of delusion, that they doe 2 Thes:

               17 If any heere do aske mee, howe came it ever about, that such foolishe and ridiculous multitudes of miracles came to bee reported, and inserted into their bookes, I must first ascribe it to the permission of God, who had fore-tolde that so it shoulde bee. Secondlye to the pollicy of Sathan vvhose kingdome by this us by a speciall meanes was inlarged. Thirdly to the cunning of the Cleargy in those daies, vvho made themselues great by the keeping vp of such reportes, concerning the sanctitie of any of their confederacy, or of such whose reliques they pretended to haue, and gained infinitely by the offeringes done in places of these wonders. And fourthly to the credulity of the people, who would beleeve any thing once set abroach by some suborned for the purpose, or by idle companions. Gulielmus Neubringensis was a writer very learned, and iudicious for that time wherein hee lived. And in his storie hee did more then once relate, the abuse of that age for spreading abroade the fames of miracles. Neubringens. l 3: 7. Henry the eldest sonne of King Henry the second of England, vvho was in his fathers life time crowned King, but dyed before his father, was every where by the people reported to have wrought great miracles after his death: vvhereas in truth he was an vnadvised and rebellious younge Prince. This shevveth hovve apte the people were to intertaine a conceite of any mans doing miracles, yea so farre that if they might haue their willes, they shoulde soone have beene shrined for Saints. Aftervvard Lib: 4▪ 9: there vvas a greate robber, vvho beeing slaine it vvas given out of many olde vvomen, that hee frequentlye did miracles, as if hee had beene some holye person, and this rumour grewe so stronge, and was so generally spredde, that the Bishop was enforced to come to Hampton, & there display the falshood of the whole narration, so that then the superstition was ended. Hee Lib: 5: 19: mentioneth also a third matter of this kinde,

that a traiterous fellow of London, called VVilliam with the longe bearde, vvas also reputed a Saint, and a maine do

                   of of miracles. Can vvee have any plainer certificate then this, that by the superstition and credulousnesse of the vulgar sort, many vvonders were saide to bee done, vvhen in truth there vvas no such matter? And if for their commodities sake any of the Cleargie would ioyne and giue countenance to the matter, the party so grovvne to be a Saint, and the fame of his vvonders shoulde never bee extinguished. The reader may by these fewe take a tast of the rest of their Saintes and miracles, for thousandes vvere done no othervvise then in this sorte, and everie man had not the vvitte to see the fraude, nor that courag

                     sed by Edm. no lesse then a vvhole douzen of Priestes conspiring vvith him, did of late for some yeeres togither put themselues into? They persvvaded some men and three maydens, that they vvere possessed vvith the Devill, and that they by their Priest-exorcizing faculties could fetch him in & out, vp and downe at their pleasure. They had a holy chaire to set their abused Disciples in, and a holy potion to administer to them; both matters pretended to be formidable to the foule spirits, but indeed trickes to cast their patients into straunge fits, that so they might seeme, as wel to themselues as others standing by, to be possessed in most hideous manner. And this was so artificially carried by the Iesuit and his fellowe Iuglers, that diverse hundreds of vnstable and vnadvised people, being cousened and cunny-catched by their impostures were contented to bee reconciled to the Church of Rome, being wonne there vnto by their stupendious miracles. A booke also or two was penned, to be spread abroade beyond the seas, of the admirable dominering of these Priests over the possessing spirits, and of the wonders which they had done vppon them. Notwithstanding now by the confessions of three of the females, & one man, al which then were the pretended possessed

persons, & of another thē a Priest & a personal actour in this exploit (all these five being sworne & speaking vpon oth) it is manifestly and vndoubtedly discovered, to be most egregious, insignious, illustrious both varletry & vilainy, that among mē professing religion & devotiō was ever heard. A man may wel suppose, that the casting out of Devils, and doing of other wonders in India & farre countries, by the Iesuites and Priestes, is a true honest & holy matter, when such vnspeakeable, & vndescribable hypocrites, do dare before such multitudes of theselues conscious of their own fraud before such troupes of stāders by, some of thē being to be presupposed to be ordinarily intelligent, & in Englād where a ielousy is iustly had of their impostures, to play, acte, exploit, so lewde, fraudulent and wicked a Pageant, and thinke that they may not only go currant away with it heere, but that the fame of this busines bruted els-where, should serve thē beyond the Seas for Catholike purposes, and bee a meanes to holde vp the reputation of the Antichristian Papacy. If our seduced Romanistes vvoulde not close their eyes, they might see vppon what trashe their religion is builte, and that their leaders care not howe they bee abused and ledde by the nose, so that their owne proiectes and int

               18 To draw then toward an end of this point, Popish wonders for the most part we precisely hould to be lies: others of thē if they be done, to be no better in respect of their end, but delusions and meanes to deceive men, by bringing them into errour. And cōcerning those that are really done, first we maintain, that they do not prove that the doers of thē are Gods servāts.

                  Vilfridus could say thus, Cōcerning your father Colūba & his followers, whose sanctity you say you imitate, & follow his rule & precepts even confirmed by signes from heavē, I can answere that at the day of iudgment many saying to the Lord, that in his name they have prophecied, and cast out Devils, & done many wonders, the Lord shall aunswere I knovve you not, vvhich aunswere of Vilfridus beeing grounded on the vvordes of CHRIST is of infallible verity. Secondlie we saye that miracles done doe not confirme, that the doctrine of those vvho doe them, is verity: since that for the convincing

of the Devill, God hath suffered heretikes to do wonders: not to ratifie their errours, but to confirme other of his truth. VVhich may aptly be applyed to the reports of miracles shewed by the Iesuits in the Indies, if so be that any of them be true. For Con. ca. 2 Costerus one of their own companions most appositely informeth vs thus, They doe saie that some of the Novatians in times past did miracles, but it vvas in testimonte of the Catholike faith amonge the Gentiles, not in vvitnesse of their errour, as hee vvho did cast out Divels in Christes name, in the ninth of Luke. Then the doctrine of wonder-doers may be false, as the persons of miracle-workers may be reprobates. To Prophecie saith Saint De simpli. praelatorū. Cyprian, and to cast out Devils, and to doe greate wonders on the earth, is a high and admirable matter. Yet he doth not attaine the kingdome of heaven, vvhosoever is founde in all these, vnlesse hee doe goe in the observation of a tust and right vvay. Thirdely vve teach that it is no argument of falsehoode in faith, not to bee able to doe vvonders, since the time of them is ceased, and vvhen they were at the best, they had in them no enforcement to make men beleeue the trueth.

Iulian the Apostata going about to reedifie the temple at Hierusalem, and God shewing three straunge vvonders against it, but yet they woulde not come to Christianitye. Not long after that, Lib: 7: 4: a Iew comming to be a Christian was miraculously healed of a disease, and yet the rest of his nation would not receiue Christ. Then the ende of them novve is to little purpose, the execution of them common to the wicked vvith the godlie, the practise permitted to Antichrist and his followers, no such perpetuall marke-set on those that bee Orthodoxe, and therefore wee striue not for them, but knovve that God hath lefte a surer vvaye to vvinne men from errour,

                  bring you of this matter, since so oft I sing the same song. My answere will be that when you leaue to steale out of other mens writings, I shall leaue to tell you of the same: but that I feare will not be till we come to the ende of your little booke. Such a gift you haue to continue that which you haue well begunne. Howe and by what meanes miracles to false and evill endes, and yet themselues thinges miraculously done, haue and may be by Sathan, Antichrist, and their followers brought about I haue shewed before. And it is as certaine that Visions, which to doating and deceived folks seeme heavenly, and so also supposed or pretended Prophecies, are of the same nature in our daies, do proceede from the same roote, & are applyed to build vp falshood and vntruth in the selfe same sort. Neither are these late forgeries or illusions any thing helped, by those divine Revelations

which formerly haue beene made; since they & these haue no affinitye or coherence the one vvith the other. That S. 2. Cor. 12: 1 Paule to stoppe the mouthes of the false Apostles who depressed his authoritie, did mention a Vision of his owne, is a matter agreed vpon; as also, that S. 2: Pet: 1: 17 Peter to testifie that what hee preached concerning Christes glorie was true, mentioneth the transfiguration of his maister in the mount, to the which he was an eie-witnesse. And this by Iesus himselfe was teermed a Math: 17: 9 Vision. Neither is it to bee doubted, but at the same time vvhen the same Peter was to bee instructed, that Gods pleasure vvas to giue the Gentiles accesse into the Church, as well as the Iewes, he had from heaven an apparition of a Act. 10, 11: 13. sheete full of all beastes cleane and vncleane, and a voice added therevnto, Kill and eate. But we would gladly learne what it is that you can conclude out of these, since the persons, the times, the vse is now most differēt, you having no affinity, nor keeping any quarter with the Apostles, no not retaining so much interest in them, as the Saracens have in Abraham, from whome by the Sozom. 6, 38. bond-woman they are lineally descended. And yet it would bee helde but a ridiculous dispute for one of thē to say, that Abrahā was familiarly acquainted with God, pleased him, & had many blessings & favours frō him therfore they the Hagarenes and Mahumetanes, are in the same grace with the Lord, & may plead any favours or privilege frō him. Touching that place of the Prophet Ioel. 2: 28: Ioel which you cite, it hath relatiō to the sensible sēding down of the gifts of the holy Ghost, which was fulfilled soone after Christes ascension. And this was intimated again by our Saviour himselfe in other words, He

                        •…
                     et givē, because that Iesus was not yet glorified. The Prophet Ioel thē foretelleth, that when Christ had appeered, there shold be visible & most admirable tokēs of Gods power & loue to his Church, in so much that many of all ages & sexes first among the Iewes, & afterward by some farther cōmunicating of it among the Gētiles, shold speake with strāg tōgues, shold see visiōi & prophecy. And that the words of Ioel have reference

to this & nothing else, S. Peter himselfe shal be witnes, whose speech this is, Act. 2. 16: 
                  These are not drunken as you suppose, since it is but the third houre of the day, but this is that vvhich was spoken by the Prophet Ioel, And it shall be in the last daies saith God, I wil powre out of my spirit vpon all flesh, & your sonnes & your daughters shall prophecy, & your younge men shall see visions, & your olde men shall dreame dreames. And to shew that this is appropriated to that, which thē & quickly after was shewed by the Apostles (I meane the speaking with strang tōgues, & the imparting of that gift to other, by thē as the instrumēts of God) the same Peter hath these words afterwards, Since 
                  33. 
                  then that Christ hath received of his father the promise of the holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which yee now see and heare. Looke then how lōg speaking mitaculously with strang tongs cōtinued in the Church, so long you may pleade out of this texte, that visions and Prophecies had their place: but that hence you should inferre that these thinges have perpetuall vse in the Church, is most incongruous and inconsequent: since the gifte of speaking strange languages is long since ceased, which at that time vvas more eminent and apparaunt then Visions and Prophcying. Now that the words of Ioel, are to bee vnderstood of that time only, witnesseth S. Ad Marcellam adversus Montanū. Hierome, who being vrged out of that very text to allow the visions & prophecies of Montanus, saith plainly that the same Prophecy agreeth to the time of the Apostles wherein Peter spake, and vnto none other. And as this maketh nothing for that which you are to prove, if your meaning bee to prove any thing, so your mentioning of the Apocalypse maketh lesse then nothing: for that which Iohn there sawe is the last Revelation commended to vs by the Lords warrant, and wee may not looke for any more such, where-vpon as on a matter of certainty, we may build our faith. S. Iohn made Canonicall Scripture of his Visions, which I trust yours cannot be. Which yet nevertheles you might as wel proue, as to make this argumēt, Iohn did see Revelations & Visiōs which were frō God, & they gaue testimony to his doctrine, Ergo you see such, and yours be of that sort.

               2 VVEE will not much striue with you about the Prophecies among the Heathen, although we doubte not but in ordinary actions of civil affaires, the Divel oftentimes did speake vndoubted truth. VVhich was, the more to draw on and allure those who were the children of vnbeleefe, and repaired to him for counsaile, that they might beleeue him in such other forged matters as vvere more for his purpose. Else they would never with such frequēcy haue runne to his Oracles. And the meanes vvhereby Sathan attained to that knovvledge, vvas partly by revelation from God, who sometimes imparteth his proiects vnto the

Vita nern. lib. 4. 3. Bernard is this, that he foretold, that albeit a Prince called Theobald had many troubles frō his enimies, yet at 5. mōths end he shold haue peace. Also he acquainted a certain messēger sēt vnto him, that he the same messēger shold become a mōke. And such like are the Visiōs & predictiōs reported of him, which as the writer of his life taking thē vp on heare-saies might fasten vpō him, to make his life & story the more famous (for this or the lik was the order for al the Saīts) so may it not well be questioned, whether God in this later age would giue such an excellent gift as prophecy is, to so smal a purpose, as only to tel such matters of so smal moment, belōging to single yea & some private mē only. Alois Lippoman, in in vitis Sāctorum. The life of their Frācis writē by Bonavētura, is so foolish & yet so blasphemous a thing, as it is fitter to bee exploded then refuted. There he telleth that this hypocrite had a visiō of certaine crūmes, which betokened the increase of his society of Franciscanes: & to ratifie this, he had 5. wounds set on him by God, like the woundes of our Saviour, & this was a confirmation of his order, as if he the Pope had imprinted some seale on it, & allowed it. He hath afterward a Chapter De divinis condescensionibus ad nutum factis, as if he could haue revelations from heaven at the least becke of his. Yea hee saith of him that he could vnderstand the secrets of mens harts. These reports as amōg fools they adde much to the worship of that Frier: So amonge the wisest they appeere to detracte much from the peculiar honour of CHRIST and his Father. These are the examples which you bringe vnto vs, whereof there are fewe which so much as in shewe make ought at all for your Popery:

and there is none of them, but in that perticuler lieth to manifest exception. So that your miracles and visions maye in like sort be reiected, as vncertaine, fradulent, fained, and communicable to the wicked as well as to the godly, and such mayserue to vphold falshoode as much as truth. In the Scripture they who had the one gift from God, many times had the other ioyned with it: but that alwayes was not so for ought that I finde, and whether it were or were not, it maketh not to your pupose. Your Papisticall visions in our daies are either diabolicall illusions, or the inventions of couseners, whose sufficient and irrefragable testimony, is nothing else but the doting fancy of some melancholike person, or the lewde devise of other who vvoulde make themselues famous, or else proiect something for the establishing of plotted purposes. And if any go about to sift thē or rifle thē vp, they haue no other warrāt but to strēgthen thē, with such other reportes, as vncetaine, & of as feeble a relation as the first, & so on, on with twenty, evē as the liar in Lucian. in

                     hilopseud. Lucian doth: or as it is the māner of figure-casters, to cōmend their practise; or as it was wonte to be in tales of the walking of the spirits, & of chambers wherin no man might dare to lye, in al which, the cōfirmatiō of one tale, was still by telling such another fable, that so one might strengthen another. We neede no better example of the goodnesse of this stuffe, then blind Motiv. 7: Bristowes reports in this behalfe, who would insinuate that one M. Allington, a Papist belike had wonderful sights, yet he will not tell vs what, but sendeth vs vp and downe London, and wee may heare of them. So you knowe diverse and sundry Papistes, vvho haue seene vndoubtedly vvonderfull visions, vvhich perhaps vvee may see recorded heereafter. You do well to say perhaps, for it would be a good while first, vnlesse it come out against your will, as somewhat hath done, vvhereof you shall heare anone: but if you woulde put it out, it woulde be a brave booke for vvinter nightes in steede of a nevve Legende. Another of M. Bristowes fabulations is, that one who was a Papist in hart, being at an English Cōmunion, saw the Devil in the liknes of a fowle blacke Dogge, take the Communion still at the hand of the Minister, as he delivered it to the cōmunicāts. What lucke our Papists haue, that they alone can so oft see the Devill? And

they alone can haue the Devils in them, which finde worke for the exorcists? He is simple that seeth not, that this was a devise to driue men frō the participation of the Lords supper. A third he hath, that a great many Cōmunion bookes lying in a sicke mans chamber, were caught vp by a fire which seemed to haue many hands, & so were throwne into a flame. He who wil so lightly bestow so much of his beleife as to credit this, may demurre vpō this actiō, whither it were not the Devils owne deed, who cānot away with the Communion booke, & therfore burneth it, not because it is bad, but because it is against him: & so have his disciples dōe. And the like may be expoūded of the black doge before, not enduring that the people shold participate of those holy misteries. It might also be asked, what so many Cōmuniō books did in one Chāber? Notwithstāding we rather hold al these things to be humane fictions, or if they were done, to be diabolical illusions.

This is thē a dāgerous thing for credulous people to be deceived by, vnlesse they chāge their iudgmēt & bee very wary. God therefore addeth farther, Vers. 28. 
                  The Prophet that hath a dreame, let him tell a dreame & he that hath my word, let him speake my word faithfully. It is then Gods word faithfully looked into, which must be the directiō to the speaker & the hearer. Else how soone might mē be deceived? That 1: Reg. 13. 9: 18.

                      10. perswading him directly against Gods wil revealed vnto him. Notwithstāding Nehemiah being  wiser, whē he might haue bin so catched by Shemiah pretēding a revelation, did not harken vnto him, but looked to that duty which was cōmaūded him. And that was it wherin mens spirit of discretiō did cōsist in those daies; to look whether they furthered the Lords service or no, when they spake, & whether other approved circumstances did concurre; for in other general matters the good & the bad, might externally seeme to ioine. The place of Deuter. 13. 1: Deuteronomy is in this behalfe worth the cōsidering, where it is saide that a Prophet may come, or a dreamer of dreames, and may give a signe or a wonder, & that also may come to passe, & yet he may be a deceaver drawing to false Gods, and is not to be followed. Then evē in those times, visions, dreames, & prophecyings taken in themselves were but tickle things to rest on, neither had they any sure groūd, but from the word, by which they were to be tried. That without them was forcible, they disagreeing from it were nothing.
               7 But now since that Christ is come, we are taught in no sort to depēd vpō thē: for the doctrin is general, & cōcerning al things, Hebr. 1. 1

                  At sundry times & in diverse māners God spake in the old time to our fathers by the Prophets, In these last daies he hath spoken vnto vs by his sonne, which Antithesis doth intend, that miracles & al means saving the word of Christ, are now cut off, frō resting our vndoubted faith thervpō. But in special touching visiōs & miracles, whē the Luc. 16: 29. Rich mā is brought in, as desiring that Lazarus might strāgly be sent, or appeere as a ghost, or in some vision, to warne his

brethren, our Saviour frameth Abrahams answer, They haue Moses and the Prophets, let them heare them, as holding that alone to be sufficient, and cutting of all other points, from being matters of certainety, where-on to rest our faith and soules. And yet as it was said of Miracles before, we deny not, but that after the ascē
                  sion of Christ, & the death of the Apostles, some & seldom times visions might be shewed to some of the elect, for their privat instructiō, satisfactiō or comfort, as Eus. Eccl. Histor 4. 14 Polycarpus did dreame that he shold be burnt for Christ, & Lib. 5: 27: Natalius by stripes givē him, or seeming to be givē him by Angels, was revoked frō heresy to an Orthodoxe opiniō, & so was Hier: epist 22▪ ad Eust: Hierom frō overmuch studying Tully & humane learning: & Theo: 516 Theodosius did dream that he should be Emperour. Where obserue we two things: first that these visions were touching privat mens ma

                  ere, & not to teach; & much lesse to broch any new or vncertain doctrine to the Church: for which purpose our Papists do vrge their visions, & especially to establish Purgatory & the appurtenances therevnto. Secondly that albeit in some few God did this, yet it was not laid downe as a fundamētal matter, that there should alwaies in the Church be such persons, neither might any mā presume to say that continually there should be such a vocatiō
                  
                     •…
                   neither could any person by an assured faith promise himselfe or other, that hee should haue such sights or predictions; neither is there any Cōmandement to test ought in religion thervpon: but rather there is much more to the cōtrary. For we heare oftē of false Prophets, & Christ biddeth vs Mat 7: 15 beware of them. Before that Hierusalē should be destroyed, which is a figure of the end of the world, he saith that Cap 24: 11 
                  many false Prophets should arise, & should deceiue many. And if the rule bee true that where miracles be, there also are visions, thē it is one of Antichrists mark, to stand on dreames & apparitions: for we are tolde that he shall come 2: The: 2 9 
                  with all power & signes & lying wonders. But to put al out of question it is added, that his manifestation shall be with all deceiueablenes of vnrighteousnes, & therfore we may rightly collect that these visions or rather fraudulent fictious, and illusions must not be wanting. How shal we then iudiciously imagine, that this may be a reason to conclude for truth, when it selfe is fully out as much communicable to vntruth? It were easie to

shew, that among heathen men this was a frawde vsed to set colours vpon their actions. The conference of

And how shall it bee in mans power, to discerne these false visions from true ones, but by the word and spirit of God, & by singular diligence: which since it cannot be in every one, the allowing of these visions & dreams, is most dangerous for Christians.

And secōdly how easy a thing is it for a cūning cōpaniō who is his crafts-master, to invēt such tales, & to sweare thē also, as he did who affirmed that he Liv: lib: 1: saw the ghost of Romulus

at Rome? In Popery there were thousands and ten thousands of these inventions, thereby to establish their Masses, Dirges, Tran. substantiation, Purgatory, and such stuffe, and by these the simple were extremely beguiled, their beleefe corrupted, and their purses picked. They who could write that Saint NOV. leg: Angl. in vita Dunstan. Dunstane whē he was awake, saw the Divell and talked with him a while, and at last with a paire of tonges redde hot caught him by the face, pulled him toward him, and made him most pitifully cry, would litle blush to report other matters of men, halfe or quite a sleepe, of which sort are the visions in the Saints liues. God Almighty hath done much for vs, who hath so farre opened our vnderstanding as to see that this is draffe, and that the Papistes are in miserable case, who rest ther faith and religion on such trumpery.
               8 That the visions of the Papacy were such fabulous fictions, wise men did long since discover. Libello contra hypocritas. Leonardus Aretinus hath a treatise against the Cleargy of his age, but covered vnder the shew of impugning of hypocrites. Among other their vsages he rehearseth this: It is worth the while to heare an hypocrite preaching amongst women, or amongst men so foolish, that they doe not much differ from women. Here are the fit auditours for their fables. Hee counterfeiteth dreames: as if hee vvere come from thence, hee talketh of the houses of heaven, which hee hath never seene. With most shamelesse impudencie hee doubteth not to affirme, things fained for things done, things never seene for those which haue beene seene.

By this meanes very good cheere is made. His iourneces puffe vp his nose, that is as I thinke fill him with new matter. He in the mean time like a Poet doth devise dreames which hee may reporte.

Divers of his friends Eius vitae l: 1 An: 1556 dying are said to appeare vnto him, & he saw their soules immediatly passing into the kingdome of heaven. Nay An: 1559: Christ himselfe was seene of him. And as he saw Visions for other, so other saw some for him; whence we may learne that false laddes neede no other brokers then themselues. This Philip and his fellowes had pretended to go into India to convert soules, but one An: 1557: Augustinus Ghettinus a Monke and confederate of his, saw Iohn the Evangelist in a Vision, who told him that Rome must be Philips Indies, that he was chosen to dresse Gods vineyard there. Thus they packed togither, that their credit might be saved, and yet they might sleep at home in a whole skinne also. Since that time Father Weston alias Edmundes the Iesuite, and his fellowes the Priestes haue made great vse of Visions in England, especially by the meanes of one Richarde Mainy who since by confession on his A declaration of Popish Impostures: Confes. of

                      Mainy. oth, hath discovered all to be but an impure and most cousening iuggling devise. It was long beleeved touching him, that he saw a glistering light come from the thumbs and fore fingers of the Priests at sundry times; which was devised to make the world beleeue, that those thūbs and fingers were most holy matters, being annointed with holy oyle when they were made Priests. In a traunce of his he said he was in Purgatory, and reported many strang things thereof, Also he foresawe that from that time till Good-Fryday he should haue Visions every Sunday, and this with like frawde was accomplished, sometimes it being prophecied that Papists should sustaine great persecutions in England: and sometimes it beeing

related that Christ with great multitudes of Angels, or the Virgin Marie with traines of blessed, Virgins, were present in the Chamber, and then downe the stāders by must on their knees, to worship thē & pray to thē. One part of Mainies fore-sightes was that on the Good-friday he should dye, but when that day came he was warned that it must be otherwise, & so indeed the deade mā is aliue yet, & hath disclosed the whol devise. Yet the shamelesse Iesuite aboue named wrote a whole quire of paper concerning these Visions of his, and many a silie Papist both be hither and beyond the seas, haue beene bobbed with the strang reports of these counterfeit Revelatiōs, & perhaps have beleeved them as they would do their Creed. Many examples more in this kind might be produced, which may teach men not to be too credulous in these cōceits, which evermore originally come vpon the report of one person, for he it is who must tell his owne dreame or Vision, and easie it is for some reporters themselues to be deluded by the Devill: as easie for some other to delude as many as wil giue credite vnto them. Then since both Divinity and humanity doe shew this to be a matter most suspecte, let Papistes accept this for a weake reason of their vnsound beleife: wee for our partes will haue nothing to doe with it.

Brigit who lived about the yeere 1370. is by our Papistes helde for a famous Prophetisse, and by the Pope she is Canonized for a Saint. In her Catalogs lib. 18. Revelations, she calleth the Pope a killer of soules, the disperser & tearer of the sheepe of Iesus Christ. Shee saith that hee is more abhominable then the Iewes, more cruel then Iudas, more vui

That those who sit with him shall be burned in fire of brimstone which is not to be quenched. Thus did shee and many other scowre the Church of Rome, which as it seemeth, Doctour Hill knevve vvell inough, and therfore suppressed the names of these, least he shold be thought to mention those who flattered the Popedome. Savanorola by the confession of vnpartiall Iudges was a man who fore-prophecied many things. He fore-tolde the comming of Charles the 8. the Frēch King into Italie, & how there he should prevaile. Philippus De bello Neapolitā. lib. 3. Comineus spake with him in person, at such time as the Venetians had thought with their armye to haue entercepted Charles returning home-ward with no great forces. And Comineus saith of hi that hīself cōmīg new frō the hēch army, yet was by him informed of many thīgs there dōe, Savanorola knowing thē better beīg absēt, thē he did who was presēt And he told Comineus that albeit Charles his master were hardly laid to by the Venetiās, yet he shold escape with safety: only his fault was that by the sword he did not reforme and redresse the abuses of the Clergy at Rome. In briefe, he stil preached against the Romanists

and wrote divers things excellently and learnedly which yet appeare. But being such a scourge vnto them, the Pope Gui

From all these & many more I draw this Conclusion, contrary to that of my adversary before vrged, That if such as haue beene esteemed for Prophets in this last age, haue had any such gift indeede, and any matter may be built on them, then the Church of Rome is a strumpet, full of corruptions, pollutions, abominations, as the very denne of Antichrist. And so rest they with their Visions, and sit they with their Prophecies.

                  NEither may heere the Protestant reply and say, that the Papists builde vpon Miracles, Uisions, Prophecies and vpon such like, but not vpon the UUorde; for all that they alleadge, are most agreeable to the word of God. Neither doe they teach any doctrine but such as is derived out of the holy Bible.
               
            
            
               
               G. ABBOT.
               
                  HOw you build vpon the Scriptures, and what account you make of the word of God, we need no better man to declare then your selfe, who do evidently shew to all the worlde, in what reverende esteeme you haue the sacred Oracles of the Lords booke, when you thinke this to bee a fit place to speake of the Scriptures, after your false imputed name of Catholikes, your Uanity and Cousening, your Perverting of Consciences, your lying Miracles, and other your not base, but most base and refuse stuffe. And as you doe place it worthily, so you insist vpon it largely, in this your whole Pamphlet consisting of an 187. Pages, allowing not full out one leafe vnto that, which is the Luk. 10: 42 
                  Unum necessarium, the sole anker of our hope, the foundation of our confidence, the ioy of our harts. VVherein you do as your graund Captaines do teach you, who vse but meane speeches concerning this word of God, yea and your Conventicle of Session: 4. Trent wickedly equalling and making of the same authority the traditions of men with the written Scripture; which sacrilegious impiety and impure blasphemy, while your auditours do not perceiue & decline, they shew themselues not only blinded but bewitched with the cup of the Apoc: 17: 21 whores inchantments. And even with the like reverence you do vse it here, as it were casting it into an odde corner, and naming it no otherwise, but as to fill vp your nūber, so skirting by it, or skipping over it as the Pli: l. 8. 40 Solin: c: 25 dogs in Egypt do by the river Nilus, where they dare not stand and drinke, but lap as they runne, and runne as they lap for feare of a Crocodile. So when you come to the Scripture, you wil stand to nothing, but touch and goe, for fear least some thing should here start out, which should devour you and your Popery. If you had beene a man of mettal, if there had beene ought in the Bible assuredly making for you, you should from thence haue cleered some question, as the sacrifice of your Masse, the Supremacy of

your Pope, the lawfulnes of your Priest-hood, or one thing or another questioned and controversed, & not haue dealt by it, as one would handle thornes, or take a coale of fire in his hand, being glad when he is first rid of it. Well, we must beare with you for your brevity in this Chapter: but for the manner of this your placing, I cannot chuse but smile, to thinke how you were troubled in this your short consultation, whither you should now be beholding to Campian, or to your old Master Bristow: for borrow needs you must: that is your profession: & Bristow you must not leaue, no not for a little moment, especially since Motiv: 8
                        •…
                     
                   somewhere he hath these very matters: And yet notwithstanding some variety of stealing would do well: not all out of Bristowe. The resolution then grew that Campians concisenesse was fitter here for your humour, and his very words you would vse. But to set them as the Cam. Rat. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . Iesuit did, in the forefront of your booke, were to lay your selfe too open; for some body might haue taken his booke, and first read it out of Latin, and then your first Chapter if it had beene your first Chapter, and read it in English. To satisfie both then, you took this honest course, that the words should be Campians, and the Methode should be Bristowes, you placing the treatise of the Scripture behind, as worthy Bristow had done before you. This sheweth that you haue a prety wit of your own. To come now to the matter, our reply is in truth as you say, that the sandy foundation of all your rotten building doth rest vpon vncertaineties, your miracles are most fained, your visions are forged, your Prophecies false, all of them out of date, no inforcement of verity to be gathered from them. And on the otherside, you haue little acquaintance with the word of God, neither by your good wils do you desire it. That which you doe, you are vrged vnto by vs, and then you wrest, you wring, you straine, you stretch, to make some shew for that, which originally is dravvne from your humane inventions. And when it is once set vp, then you labour to haue some colour to warrant it, or at least to make some glose howe simple folke may take it for good payment. Your workes of supererogation, whereby a man may doe more then deserue heaven for himselfe, and haue somewhat to spare for other, your dispensatiō of the treasure of your Church by the

Indulgences of your Pope, your Canonizing of Saints, your creating of Lumbus, your forging of Purgatory, & a multitude more or rable rather of vpstart novelties since the age of the Apostles, are derived frō the tricks of their wit, who haue made their purse, their belly, and their worldly pompous honour to be their God, their summū & solum bonū. As for the sacred word, frō thence they are not taken; vnlesse you meane that they be so derived out of the holy Bible, as that they were never in it; & so we deny not, but your superstition may be taken out of it. But were these controversed matters but probably to be collected out of the sacred Oracles, you would not runne to such beggerly shiftes, as in this whole Pamphlet of yours, you are driven vnto. They must make a shew with Counters, & cary about thē a purse full stuffed with them, who want gold and silver, & yet cannot for beare, but they will be craking.

                  ANd for the maintaining thereof, they are not compelled to deny certaine parts of Gods holy Booke, as the Protestants and their Prede▪

The Manichees for that their heresies were so manifestly confuted by the Gospell of Saint Matthew, and by the Actes of the Apostles, as they sould coine no answere, nor other shift, they denyed them to be Scripture. The Ebionites because the Epistles of Saint Paule disproved most plainely Circumcision, which they maintained, denyed them to be Scripture. Luther reiected the Epistle of S. Iames, because it was so plaine against the doctrine of only faith. His of-spring refused the Bookes of Tobias, of Ecclesiasticus, of the Machabees and of some others, because in them is plainely taught the Doctrine of the custody of Angels, of Free-will, of Praier for the Faithfull Soules departed, and of Praier to Saints, all which they deny, and therefore must they needs deny those parts of the holy Bible.
               
            
            
               G. ABBOT.
               2 YOu charge vs with denying of some partes of Gods holy booke, as not making for vs: and certainely we shoulde repute our selues men impious and irreligious, if wee tooke any

thing away from that which is so absolute, that it may well bee compared to a Circle, where if any thing be added, it maketh a balke, if any thing be subtracted, it maketh a bracke. We do right wel know, that he who taketh away ought frō the word of the everlasting God, the Lord shal take away his Apoc. 22. 19. portion out of the booke of life, (for the speech may be applied to the whole Scripture as wel as to S. Iohns Revelation) But we wil you to remēber the other part of the holy Ghosts divisiō, that God shal adde the Vers. 18. plagues writen in that booke, to him who addeth ought to the book of the Lord. Whē therfore you labour to establish that for authētical, which is not inspired frō the holy Ghost, but a matter seperat & seiunct, you may iustly fear least you incurre that peril, which you would post of to vs. What heretiks haue done against the Divine volume, we dislike and detest as wel as you. We condemne it in the August de vtilit. credend cap. 2: & 3: Manichees that they accepted not the old Testament; that they questioned the Gospell of Saint Matthew as not being that which S. Matthew wrote, because it manifestlie shewed that Christ was born a mā, which they denied; that they extenuated the authority of the Acts of the Apost. as being much corrupted. For this their-sacrilegious attēpt, we cēsure thē as deep ly, & cōdēne thē as much as you do. The like mind we do cary of the Euse: Eccl. Hist▪ l: 3: 21: Ebionits, whose opiniōs sprūg vp in the time of the Evāg. S. Iohn, & they wold gladly haue retained circūcisiō stil, as being a necessary duty of the Lawe, & that which Christ & his Apostles had received in their own persōs. And because S. Pauls Epistles had so directly oppugned this their cōceit, as also had shewed the whole ceremonial law to be extīguished, they would clean haue expūged thē out of the Canō. We repute these for evil heretiks, & we accept of al the bookes of the old Testamēt, which can be proved to be the Testamēt, & we questiō nothīg of the New. Only as you wold not like, if vnto the new Testamēt the Gospell of Nicodemus, or Hermes his Apocriphal Pastor shold be sewed, so we cānot endure that those tracts should be reputed part of the Hebrews Canō, which the Iews never knew. These 2. Periods of the Manichees & Ebionits, as also the 2. next touchīg Luther & his of-sprīg, you haue trāslated word for word out of Cāpiās first Reasō. And if there had bin in you grace, & an indifferēt mīd, you

                   answered. But your meaning is to be wilfully blind. There is nothing more false then thar Luther reiected the Epistle of Iames. He acknowledged it as Scripture, & cited it as he did other books. And how shāfully was Cāpian put to his plūges, whē havīg Luthers works laid before him, & being bidde turne to that place, where Luther so depressed & vilefied that Epistle, he could find no such thīg, but said it was so in a copy of Luthers works which was at Prage in the Emperours Library. And if any had sought it there, then the booke had beene removed to some other place, as the Munsten Cosmogr: l: 2: tree which Aeneas Silvius saith was sought in diverse coūtries, & still missed; that tree I meane whose leaues fallīg into the river, were turned into Barnacles. You might do wel in behalfe of Campian to shew some one of Luthers followers in Germany, Dēmarke or else-where, who is so opposite to S. Iames his Epistle: for those whom some cal the Rigidi Lutherani, do sinke nothing which he held. Since thē both they & we, & al who professe the reformed Religion, do accoūt it Canonical, it is but an idle speculation to make that obiection. And why should Luther fly that booke as crossing the doctrine of only faith, since all other who maintaine that doctrin, do accept of that Epi. also. S. Iames doth not thwart that which S. Paul had taught: for the spirit of God is not cōtrary to it self, & if there be any difficulty in one Iac: 2: 24: single text of that Epistle, it is to be explicated out of other places, which are more cleere & opē. S. Paule thē in his Epistles to the Romans & Galathiās, hath so manifested that point of Iustificatiō by faith alone, that he who without preiudice wil read the text, shal never need any Cōmentary. It is so plaine that diverse Papists looking into that, & laying aside false and perverted glosses, haue embraced that doctrine. Sleidan. l: 21: Vergerius who intēded to write against Luther in that Argumēt, was by traversing of it, caught himselfe. Nay Ferus and Albertus Pighius who otherwise is a grosse Papist, haue subscribed vnto it. And wheras our Papists obiect, that S. Paul saying that a mā is iustified without the workes of the law, doth meane nothing else but the ceremonial law; that is lōg since refuted & resolved by S. Aug: de spirit. & liter, cap, 14: Austē otherwise. The same father also doth notably shewe, that there is no contrariety betvveene the tvvo

                  In 83, quaest, c. 76. Apostles; for that when S. Iames doth say that a man is iustified by works, he doth no more crosse S. Paule, then the same Apostle doth crosse himselfe Rom. 2. 13. saying, The hearers of the Lavve are not righteous before God: but the doers of the Law shall bee iustified. That it is most true which S. Paule hath, that a man is iustified by faith without workes, because no works done before beleeving, helpe toward iustification: but that in beleeving actually a man is reputed iust before God, & that if he die immediatly, having no time to worke, yet he by beleeving is iustified: Notwithstanding that if he liue he ought to bring forth good fruit. His cōclusion is that S. Paule doth speake of workes going before faith, & S. Iames speaketh of works following that faith which hath iustified. And a right beleefe wil not be without them, if it have time to shew it selfe. I might heere adde how frequent a thing it is, with diverse Doctors of the Church, to vse the word of onely faith in speaking of our Iustificatiō; but of that hereafter. Thē to shew that neither Luther nor we need feare the Epistle of S. Iames, as crossing our other doctrine, we say that S. Paule doth speake of acceptatiō to be iust, S. Iames intendeth a declaration that we are iustified: the one beateth on that before God, where the setled apprehension of faith prevaileth, which notwithstāding wil not be without his convenient fruit; the other mentioneth that before men, who know not the hart, but must iudge of that which is externall, & therefore it is rightly said by the Apostle, in their persons,

               3 Whom you meane by the of-spring of Luther we cānot telt but if al who refuse those books be termed his of-spring, his children shalbe a thousand yeeres elder then himselfe; for many of the most anciēt fathers did disclaime the books of Tobias, Ecclesiasticus, & the Machabees for being Canonical. & if the rule of Hist, Ecol, lib, 3. 19, Eusebius he good, (as no wise mā wil deny it), that the Canonical volumes may be distiguished frō the Apocryphal & suppositious, by the iudgmēt of the church, by the stile, by the matter & purpose of the books, they had great reasō not to acknowledge thē; for the Church vniformly did never admit thē, & they are not writtē in the language of the Iews, to whō 
                  Rom. 3, 2. 
                  were cōmitted the Oracles of God, & therfore if they were part of Gods Oracles before

the comming of Christ, these Iewes should haue admitted them and retained them: which they did not: and the matter of them is but meane and ignoble in comparisō of the vndoubted Scripture. What a doubtful narration is that in Cap. 6. 17 Tobias, that a spirite should smell a perfume, (when spirits haue no flesh & bones, by the testimony of Luc: 24. 39 Christ himselfe, & cōsequētly no organes of sc̄e) & that the hart & liver of a fish should drive away the Devil? Which if it were so, S. Peter was much overseene, when he taught vs how to repulse Sathā, by 1 Pet. 5: 9. 
                  resisting him being stedfast in the faith. For it had bin an easier way to have said, get you the hart & liver of such a fish, & make a perfume with it, & he dareth not come nigh you. And this would wel haue beseemed S. Peter to set men to catch such fish, in remēbrance of his owne occupatiō, since himselfe was a fisher. But what if yong Toby had met with such a spirit, as those were of whom Christ saith, Matth. 17. 21. 
                  This kind goeth not out but by fasting and praier? The treatise called Ecclesiasticus, if for any cause it should come into the Canon, it must be for Salomons sake, whom many would haue to bee the authour of it. But the Preface it selfe remaineth, confessing it to be the worke of Iesus Sirachs sonne, & of another Iesus his grande-father: and the booke mētioneth Cap: 48. & 46. Elias, Ezechias, Iosias, Ieremy & diverse other, who lived hundreds of yeeres after Salomon. And howe questionable a narration is that in it, that Cap 46. 20: Samuel should tell of Saules death after his owne burial, which as diverse learned men thinke, is a report to be beleeved in Necromācy rather thē in Divinity. For if the souls of the righteous being departed, be in the hād of God, which our Romanists must cōfesse out of the booke of Cap: 3. 1: Wisdome, & we do beleeue out of the saying of David Psal 31. 5. 
                  Into thine hād I cōmend my spirit, if those who die in the Lord, Apoc: 14: 13: do rest frō their labors, how shal we suppose that the soule of such an excellēt Prophet as Samuel was, might be at the cōmand of so base & vile a witch, to be fetched frō heaven at her pleasure? Or what rest shal other faithfull men and women bee imagined to haue after this life, if Necromancers, VVitches and Coniurers haue such power over them? Albeit therefore that some of the auncient speaking according to the 1. Sam: 2

Yea Chron l 1: Genebrard himselfe maketh a great doubt whither it were Samuel or no, and citeth Tertullian and diverse other of the Auncients resolving the contrary. As for the bookes of Machabees there be many thinges in them, that no man can maintaine (& therfore no part of them is so much as reade in our Church) as that 1. Mach. 1. 7: Alexāder parted his kingdome among his servants while he was alive, that the Cap 8 7. Romanes tooke the greate Antiochus aliue, that they tooke from him Cap. 8. 8. India, and Media, and Lydia, and gaue them to King Eumenes: that they had a Senate consisting of Vers. 15. three hundred and twenty men who consulted daily: that they yeerely committed their Vers. 16. government to one man, whom all obeied; and that there was no hatred or envy amongst them. Also it wil never bee made hang togither that Iudas should be aliue in the 2: Math 1. 10. hundred fo

Neither that Antiochus should 1 Mac. 6. 8: die in his bed for griefe and sorrow, and in another place should be slaine in the temple of 2. Mach: 1: 13. 16. Nanea, and there haue his head and the heads of his company cut of, and in a third Cap. 9: 28: passage should die a miserable death in a strange country among the mountaines, & that should be only by the Dan 8. 25. hand of God, & without any helpe of man. Nor that 2. Mach 1. 18. Nehemias should builde the Temple & the aulter at Ierusalem, vvhen indeede they vvere Ezr. 313. & cap 6: 15: builte before his comming vp; nor that it is to bee founde in the vvorkes of 2. Mac: 2: 1: Ieremie the Prophet, that he commaunded the people who were ledde away captiue, to take fire with thē. Moreover it were worth the knowing, how by good Divinity the fact of Razias Cap. 14: 42: murthering himselfe may any wise be cōmended. And whether such as were the pen-mē of the holy Ghost, do vse to craue pardon of their infirmity

& insufficiēty, in delivering that which is to be named Canonical Scripture, which the Cap: 15: 39 author of the later book of the Machabees doth. Many more such blemishes are to be foūd in these tracts, which evidently shew that no doctrine of infallible verity can be grounded vpon them: but where they haue ought agreeing with the Canonical Scriptures they may bee accepted, because they consent with the other; where they haue ought disagreeing, that same cannot be warranted because it is in these Apocriphal to be found, but it is to be repudiated as the errour of a man, since a greater, (God himselfe who speaketh in his owne word,) doth impugne it.
               4 Now for the points of doctrine which you would vrge out of these bookes, thus we say. That Angels are deputed to safegard Gods elect we doubt not; for the 
                  Psal: 34: 7: 
                  Angel of the Lord pitchethroūd about thē that feare him, & delivereth thē, & those whō the 2: Reg: 6. 17: servant of Elizeus saw, do testifie so farre, neither do we so much as call it into question, but that they are Hebr. 1. 14, 
                  ministring spirites, sent & imploied in messages, as the Luc, 1, 26, Angel Gabriel was to the Virgin Mary, & when and where otherwise it pleaseth God. But what can our Papists collect hence? That they are to be prayed vnto, or that they are to be worshipped? We find no warrant any where for the former: & they thēselues refuse the latter. I 
                  Apoc. 19: 10, 
                  am one of thy fellow servaunts saith the Angel to Iohn, Worship God. Or can they proue that an Angell doth so sensibly, & serviceably waite on men, as this mentioned in Tobias is reported to do? And if they could, what doth it crosse any point in our religion, since al must be done by the Lords appointment, & the glory must be given vnto him? As for free-vvill in that sence which the Church of Rome doth teach it, we deny. Neither doth the text of Ecclesiasticus Eccle. 15, 15, necessarily inforce it, being as fit to be vnderstood only of Adam in his first creation, as otherwise. And the words of this writer being soberly taken, may cary no other sence then vvhat is to be found in vndoubted bookes of Deut: 30, 19, Scripture; vvhich textes notwithstanding we deny not, but by comparing place to place give them their right exposition.

                   Machabees is too weake, to proue praier for faithfull soules lying in Purgatory to be lawfull. The text it selfe in the Originall is so perplexe, that an evident and certain sence cannot be made of the words. And who doth not see there, that they were not faithful persons, but rather grosse sinners which were slaine, and such as may bee thought to haue received a iust iudgment from God, both on body and foule, for medling with the Anathema or excommunicate thing? Iudas therfore who was a man so experienced in the law of Moses, could not be so simple as to send an offring, or to cause praiers to be made for the soules of them who were thus flaine, (especially when all offrings were prescribed in the Leviticall law, but there was none immediately concerning the persons of dead men, but all for the living:) this therefore was the misse-conceite of the authour, writing therein his owne fancie, rather then the fact of Iudas. For that worthy man wel knewe, that the atonement and reconciliation was to be made, for the rest of the people and army which lived, who might smart in and for their fellowes sinne, as their fore-fathers had done for the Iosua. 7. 5. transgression of Achan. The offring then and praier at Hierusalem was to prevent this, and not for the soules of them who dyed in their sinne, and were not godly persons as the wordes of the Authour may seeme to import. That men should pray to Saints, I finde nothing in these treatises. Only somewhat there is that Mac. 15: 12 14. Onias and Ieremy did pray for the whole people of the Iewes. And what will you infer vpon these? You might vnderstand, that we deny not, that the Saints in heaven do pray in general for the good of the Church: but that they in particular, know our wants, heare our callings, vnderstand our wishes, that remaineth for you to proue. Besides you might perceiue that this was a Vision, wherein things are represented otherwise then really they are, as it was with S. Peter, who conceived that a Act: 10. 11 sheete full of all cleane and vncleane beasts was let downe vnto him, which neverthelesse I trust you will not say was so indeed. So that from the words & circumstances of a Vision,

you can concludingly evince no more, then from the words and circumstances of a P

And yet farther without impiety it may be doubted whither the Generall here did not vse a tricke of war, which Alexander and other Graund leaders haue experimented, that is to incourage men by a dreame artificially fained and reported, the benefit whereof in worldlye mens iudgement is such, that Ca: 20: 146 Leo Imperator in his military precepts hath this for one, Thou shalt cause in thy souldiours alacrity to the battaile, if on the day of fighte thou rising in the morning, shalt say that some dreame was sent vnto thee from God, which doth incite thee to invade thine enemies, and sheweth thee some kinde of helpe to fight. Then if you had your will touching the authority of these controversed books, you could not make one quarter of the gaine by them as you suppose, but since they are not of the right stampe, we may not allow thē to you. Be the matter in thē for vs or agaīst vs, we may not authorize those for Authentike Scripture, which God hath not so authorized. In the 2. of the Machabees there is a place against Limbus Patrū, where one of the seven brethren saith, Cap 7: 36 
                  My brethren that haue suffered a little paine, are now vnder the divine covenant of everlasting life, that is to say, at that very time inioying it, and in possession of it, for if it be vnderstood but of the way thither, the mother and brother yet remaining aliue, were also vnder that covenant of assured hope: but we account not of this testimony, neither do wee vrge it, because the booke whence it is taken, is Apocryphal.

But we contrarywise doe teach our people to cary with them Gods booke, to read it and meditate on it, to try our teachīgs therby, & not to force the exposition thereof to their own humour, but to the purpose of the holy Ghost. And so I leaue you, and this your slaunder.
               6 Here to proceed a litle farther in the matter of this Motiue; we are charged (as the Reader doth see) to offer iniury to the scriptures, in denying those to be Canonicall whō the Romanists do grace with that name. But what is our fault? Is it that we do not allow all that to bee of vndoubted authority, which is within the cōmon volumes of the Bible? Yea that is it, as M. Bristow & his fellows belike wold say. We answer that if this be it, the Church of Rome it selfe is gilty of that crime. For are there not 2. books which are cōmonly called the 3. & 4. of Esdras, which thēselues evermore cōprise within their Bibles, & yet repute not Canonical?

                  dith, Wisdome, Ecclesiasticus and the two books of the Machabees, but of these of Esdras not a word. Heere then by the iudgement of that renoumed Synode, (which curleth as many as ioine not with it) some tractes in the Bible are now as good as leaped out of the Bible.

This fact of theirs wil warrāt our proceedings; since by the same reason wherefore they seclude some, may more bee shut out, if they do deserue it. Gentle Genebrard saw this wel, and therfore he was desirous, although it were but by the head & shoulders, to haue pulled in these two bookes againe. Lib. 2: Chron: An. 3638. & postea: He therefore more then once is vehement for them, & would make vs belieue, that although in the first Synode which long since did canonize the bookes of holy writte, they were not admitted, yet in a later Synode the Canon was made larger. And reasons for this he maketh shew to giue. But it is too late Genebrard; you come after the faire. The Councel which cannot erre hath shut them out of dores: the Pope hath ratified their Decree, & therfore you lose your labour; and you are but one man against so many Fathers; therfore best pul in your hornes. For as with your owne side you are like to gaine nothing, so otherwise you wil pul an olde house on your head, whē by your example you teach vs, that a private man may question, yea conclude against that which your Counsels haue determined. Where by the way, let not the simple and vnlearned Christian wonder, that in this best booke the Bible, there should be any thing which is not properly a member of it; for we therin as also in reading some part of them publikely, doe but imitate the custome of the most auncient & purest Zanch. in Observat: in cap. 1

                      Confessiō: Churches, ioyning that with Gods most sacred word, which vniversally hath bin ioyned among Christians, since almost the eldest times, and is not refused by the most reformed Churches at this day; but we distinguish these writings from the divine volumes, and note them by the name or appellation of Apocripha, as hidden in comparison of the bright light of the other, which may wel endure the light and sunne-shine. And by a little Preface before those doubted bookes as also by the Articles of Religion agreed on in Cōvocation, An. 1562. we teach what opinion the Church hath of them; that they are not received to be publikely expoū
                  ded, nor to confirme matters of doctrine, but only as they cōsent with the other which are Canonical; or onely as the writings of some godly men, which may serue to giue light to the history, or containe some not vnprofitable instructiōs touching good manners. And these things in our Sermōs & writings we do fequētly

notify. So that this indifferent course being held, there is no iust cause of offence givē either to the weake beleever, or to the malitious & clamorous adversory; that being done which anciently in the best Christian Churches was done, and yet the people be taught but howe and in what sence it is done. Nay, our Church hath beene so carefull for giving any vvay iust occasion of scandale in this matter, that it permitteth the Minister to reade in steede of any of these Apocriphal Chapters, other Canonicall lessons vpon the Sun-daies and Holy-daies, and therefore much more vpon the working-daies, as hee in his wisedome & iudgement shal see fit, requiring of him prudence & discretion in that behalfe. Which appeareth in the Second Tome of Homilies, set out by publike An. 1563. authority almost in the beginning of her late Maiesties raigne. For there in the An admonition to al Ministers Ecclesiasticall. Preface this advertisement being given, to all Ministers, For that the LORD doth require of his servant whom bee hath set over his housholde, to shevve both faithfulnes and prudence in his office &c. some thinges are advised vnto him touching his duty, but lastly this is subnected and subioyned, And vvhere it may so chaunce some one or other Chapter of the olde Testament to fall in order to bee reade vpon the Sundaies or Holy-daies, vvhich vvere better to bee chaunged vvith some other of the New Testament, of more edification, it shall bee vvell done to spende your time to consider vvell of such Chapters before hand, vvhereby your prudence and diligence in your office may appeere, so that your people may haue cause to glorifie GOD for you, and bee the readier to embrace your labours, to your better commendation, to the discharge of your consciences and their owne. Which pointe being well considered, avoideth all blame from the Church of England, even in the eyes of them that would seeme most quicke-sighted, it being not onely permitted to the Minister, but also commended in him, if vvisely and quietly hee doe reade Canonicall Scripture vvhere the Apocryphal vppon good iudgement seemeth not so fitte, or any Chapter of the Canonicall may bee conceived not to haue in it so much edification before the simple, as some other parte of the same Canonical may be thought to haue. For the wordes wil very well cary both these.
               7 VVell then, if there bee reasons why the Church of Rome

doth shut out from the Canon these bookes of Esdras, and yet they are printed and bound vp with all their ordinary Bibles, if the same or such like exceptions may bee taken, against Iudith, Tobias, and the rest, is there not as great reason that they also should be secluded from the Canonicall, albeit they remaine in the volume of the Bible? The exceptions against all these controversed writings are many, but I will reduce them briefly to these three plaine heads, which I meane to touch. First the matter of the bookes of Esdras is slight and vaine, without maiestie, and vnworthy the holy and sacred spirit of God. Secondly these tracts are not to be founde in the Canon of the old, that is, the Iewish Church. And thirdly in the computation of Christians they are also reiected. If we lay these lines and rules to the rest, we shall finde them of very little different quality. For first the matter of them is not coherent with the rest of the vndoubted scripture. In Cap: 5. 12 Tobias, the Angell vtteteth somewhat of himselfe, which cannot literally be avoided: when he saith to old Tobias, I am of the kinredos Azarias, and Ananias the great, and of thy brethren. So, it is a narration worthy at the least to be pawsed vpon, that the Cap: 6: 13: seven husbands of Sara should be killed by an evil spirit, the first night of their mariage. Of the hart and liver of the fish I haue spoken before? Is it not a likely matter that Cap: 8. 9

                   Raguel would make a graue for him, whom the day before hee so advisedly tooke for his sonne in law, now to bury him before hee was dead? They are not matters to bee commended by the penne of the holy Ghost, that Iudith should Iud: 10: 3: 4 dresse and tricke her selfe more then became a matrone, that so she might allure Holofernes to wantonnesse; that shee Cap. 12: 12 14: 18: c: 13: 1 should make shew as not to deny to lie with him: that shee should tell such evident Ca. 10. 12. 13 vntruthes to his servants at her first taking, and to Ca: 11: 15: 16 himselfe afterward. That the Iewes should haue peace so long in her life Ca. 16. 25. time, and a great while after her death is a matter vnprobable, since these warres of Holofernes, are saide to be made in the time of King Cap. 2. 1. Nabuchodonosor, and while the first temple or Ca: 16: 20 Sanctuary stood. Nay the consultation concerning this warre, is reported to be in the Cap. 2: 1

same king sent Nabuzaradan his steward to Hierusalem, vvho burnt the house of the Lorde, the Kinges house and all other of worth in the citty. Adde to this, that whereas the writers of the bookes of Kings and Chronicles, are most exacte in setting downe all great warres, and victories of the Iewes, from the time of Saul to the ruinating of the first temple, there is not one word of any person or circumstance belonging to this warre in them, nor in any other vndoubted booke of holy writ. Yea Iosephus who was a Iew, and with much learning and labour continueth the story of his countreymen, from Adam to his own daies, hath not the least mention of this Iudith, or ought appertaining to her, which he being so desirous to cōceale nothing, which might make for the honour of his people, would never in such deepe oblivion haue buryed. These things may well be questioned.
               8 The book of Wisdome is by some of the Popish Synagoge, not only accounted to be Canonicall Scripture, but also reputed to be Sixt. sent: Bibli. lib: 1. & 8: Salomons, if not for the compiling, yet at least for the matter. And the reason therof is yeelded, because there is in it a praier in the Sap. 9. 1. name of Salomon. But Vide Sixt. Senens. vbi supra Bellar de verbo Dei li. 1. 13 learned men of our parte, rather hold it to be the worke of Philo the Iew, (which also Bellarmine citeth out of S. Hierome) and that not the elder Philo, but even the same who with some other of his countrymen, was sent in embassage to the Philo de legat. ad caium: Emperour Caligula, to intreate him that the Iewes might not be forced to accept of, and to erect his image or statue at Hierusalem, which they held to be contrary to the law of their Moses. He therefore compiled that worke insinuating to Kings and great men moderation in their governement, terrour of torments after this life, and the extreme vanity of Idols, matters most fit for their present purpose to Caligula; & to giue never the lesse credit to all his words, he was contented that Salomons name should be vsed in the praier before mentioned, because the name of wise king Salomon was famous over al the world. And that for this purpose,

Since then the matter of these volumes hath such imperfections in it, that it cannot keepe coherence with the vn-questioned Oracles of the sacred Scripture, and the Spirit of the Almighty is ever vniforme, & never dissenting from it selfe, if the other books

do stand, as not a Mat: 5. 18: title of them shall perish vnto the worlds end, these then must needs fal from that high credit to which Papists would bring them, and we are not to blame, when we acknowledge not them for divine, who haue no such slampe vpon them.

Yet here that is to be remembred, which briefly before I touched concerning S. Ambrose, that this mistaking in this worthy Father grew, by his want of knowledge in that tongue, wherein the old Testa, was originally writtē: by which means he was not acquat̄ed with many things appertaining to the Iewish church; vnto whō since al Scripture before Christs time was cōmitted, if these had bin Scripture, they also should haue bin cōmended, & then they should haue bin written in the tongue which they vnderstood, that is to say in the Hebrew, & not in the Greek, which was a lāguage of the Gētiles: & as Aut l: 30. 9 Iosephus testifieth, the Iews did not accōmodate thēselues to the learning of any tongue but their own, which is to be interpreted of the ordinary sort of thē. But all these controversed writings are only in the Greeke▪ and not in the Hebrew, which is a maine argument against them, and ruinateth the very foundation of them. Now that S.

This was very soone after the age wherin the Apostles lived. It is heere to be marked concerning this holy man, as also of al the rest whom I shall name, that they never had in this businesse reference to ought, but to the course of the Iewes, accepting their iudgement for the bookes of the olde Testament to be that, wherevnto Christians also should cleaue. Not long after that time came Clemens Alexandrinus, of whom Lib. 6: 11: Eusebius writing saith that hee cited the bookes of Wisedome and Ecclesiasticus in his vvorkes, vvhich bookes saith Eusebius, all men do not receiue. And he addeth, as it may seeme to prevent, least any man vpon his example should attribute much to those two, that he cited also the Epistle of Barnabas & of Clement.

                  There be Canonicall of the old Testament two and twenty bookes, equal in nūber to the Hebrew letters. For among the Hebrewes the elemēts of the letters are so many. But besides these there be yet of the same old Testamēt other books not Canonical, which are read only to the Catechumeus. Heere is a most manifest distinction betweene the Canonical and the Apocryphall, and a signification that these inferiour volumes were only read, to such as were novices in the faith, but

they were not accounted authentical & vnquestionable. Next I ioyne Epiphanius who lived in Cyprus, & he Haetes 8: rehearseth for Canonical Scriptures of the old Testament the Iewes bookes, & the other not admitted by them he expungeth for Apocryphal. And in a Haeres: 76: second place, reckoning vp al the divine writings, he shutteth out these Apocryphal fellows, only after al the volumes of the old & new Testamēt rehearsed, he nameth also the Wisedoms of Salomō & of the sonne of Sirach.

In the meane time we see, that thus Epiphanius who was very wel skilled in the Hebrew, keepeth close both with the Iewish Canon, and the iudgement of the Easterne Church.
               13 Gregory Nazianzen hath a De veris libris Scriptur▪

He in the old reckoneth vp two & twenty books, after the Iewish fashiō so oft aboue mētioned, & no more. There he putteth al these whō we acknowledge, & vouchsafeth not so much as to name Tobias or Iudith, or any one of those whō we seclude. And so doth he againe De recta educatione

To all these so famous & learned men of the East & Greeke Church, wil I adde for the conclusion, the Councel of Laodicea, which in the last Canon. 59 Canon recapitulateth all the Canonicall bookes of the old Testament, but hath not one of those whom the Romanists vvould gladly thrust vpon vs. Nowe is it not a greate sinne thinke you, for vs to ioyne in iudgement vvith so many learned and holie

men, with all the good and religious Hebrews, who were before the time of Christ, withal the Eastern Church without impeachment, for ought that I can truely find? Are not we worthy to be reviled and revelled at, as renters, tearers and clippers of the sacred Bible? I doe marvaile why we should be Heretikes for not admitting of these Apocryphals, since so many Fathers and reverend Doctors of the Primitiue Church, did the same that wee do, and yet heretiks they are none. Yea but the Romanists doe loue to be tried by themselues. And great reason, The Westerne Churches, they will say, haue ever beene of another minde. Wel yet here is but one against two, and then by S. Austens rule before named, the matter should go on our side. But what if we find in the Latin Church, as much against it, as for it?

See his own opinion consonant with that of the Greekish and Iewish Church, vnto which number saith hee some doe adde Tobias and Iudith, and so make foure and twenty. Marke that they be but some who do adde more: and these doe adde but two, so that the Machabees and the rest are vndoubtedly gone in his iudgement, nay I may say in his minde these two also. But if any man be in this cause to be heard it is Hierome, whom Lodovicus Vives some-where did truely call miraculum orbis, the miracle of the worlde. Hee lived a good while at Rome, and thought highly of that Church, and therefore would not hastily break from any thing, vvhich generally, or vvith good ground was there received. Hee travailed into Palestina, and there spent much of his time, and by longe conference vvith a Ievve, and other his extreame labour, attained to the exact knovveledge of the Hebrevve tongue, and there-vpon as some thinke translated the vvhole Bible into Latin, as others suppose reformed and castigated that version, vvhich is called the Vulgar; and is now only currant among the Papists. Also hee made those learned Commentaries on the Prophets, which labour may truly be said to be the glory and beauty of all his vvorkes, vvhich yet otherwise are renoumed sufficiently. Then if any man bee

to be heard in this Argument, it is this Hierome, and that deservedly. Hee then speaking of Iudith, bestovveth this ierke on it, Epist 10: 
                  UUee doe reade in Iudith, notvvithstanding of it please any man to receiue that booke. But aftervvarde hee goeth more generally to vvorke, and Epist: 
                        •…
                     06. sheweth which are the Canonicall bookes, even those whome vvee holde for Canonicall; and vvhich are Apocryphall, even the very same that wee reckon for Apocryphall. Neither hath hee yet done, but continuing in the same iudgement, he sheweth how and in what manner, the Church readeth and accepteth those inferiour bookes, Epist: 115. 
                  As therefore the Church indeed doth read the bookes of Iudith, of Tobias and the Machabees, but doth not receiue them among the Canonical scriptures, so it may read also these two volumes, that is Ecclesiasticus and the booke of Wisdome, to the edification of the people, not to confirme the authority of Ecclesiasticall doctrines. What would he haue said thinke you, if he had seene our Papists bring these bookes, as the chiefe pillers of praier for the dead, and intercession of Saints, and other such like Apocryphal trumpery.
               14 And that there were more learned men of the Westerne Church, in the same minde with Hierome, wee appeale to that treatise on the Creede of the Apostles, vvhich some suppose to haue beene written by Cyprian, and for that cause it is found among his workes, but more generally it is thought to be of Ruffiuus his doing, who very well might speake for the evidency of truth, but is not to be imagined to say any thing in favour of Hierome, with whom he had hote & great

                  THE Church of God hath ever beene accustomed, when any heresie did spring vp therein to gather a Councell of Bishops, Prelates, and of other learned men, in which the truth was approved, & the heresie condemned. And whosoever were cōdemned by such Councels, cō
                     firmed by the See Apostolike, were ever deemed, & in very deed were heretikes, and for such at length were taken of all men, and in the end vanished away. So were the Arrians condemned in the Nicene Councell, the Macedonians in the Councell of Constantinople, the Nestorians in the Ephesine, the Eutychians in the Chalcedonian, & others in other Councels. All which heretikes although they flourished for a time, and drew manie people yea Emperours, Kings, States and Countreies after thē, yet in time they came to nothing, and the Councels which condemned them were vniversally embraced.

which were there of any reckoning be remembred, yet the Bishops as having voice alone are at last nūbred by themselues. In the first Nicene Councel it seemeth by Soz▪ l: 1. 19 Sozomen that Cō
                  stantine the Emperoure had a suffrage. But it may be doubted whither Athanasius had any or none, being then no Bishop, yet a right worthy man, & on whom the burthen of disputing with the Arrians there, didly as much as vpon any one man whatsoever. It were good therefore that it were agreed vpon betweene you Papists, who be the proper and peculiar persons who haue consent of iudgment and deciding in Councels, before that you build too much vpon such Convocations. In contro. Costerus saw that there was no small scruple in this and other circumstances belō
                  ging to Councels, & therefore he would not meddle at all with this Argument. 2. Bellarmines opinion is that ordinarily only Bishops 1. Bellar. de

Princes are called to defende the Councell, and to take notice what is decreed that they aftervvarde may castigate such as stande against it. Other lay men may be present to performe some necessarie services to such Assemblies. Now you are as it seemeth, for the extraordinary.
               2 For the second point, if the supremacy of your Pope must stande vpright, it vvill prooue to be his alone to call and assemble Councels. For giue it to Princes, and then they shall bee supreme governors in causes Ecclesiasticall, vvhich you will not admit, albeit it be, an evident truth: & permit it to the Cardinals, then you set the mēbers aboue the head, the coch before the horses. Your Popes in these later ages haue take on thē to cōvocate al Synods, & wil not indure that any man should meddle vvith that matter, which they desire to keepe as charily as the apple of their eie.

Nay Chatles the 5. a late Emperour, and one who much more then mough was devoted to the Romane Bishops, had learned so farre to walke in the waies of his noble Progenitours and Predecessours, that without the Popes privity or consent he gathered assemblies in matters of religiō: which as In Actis Lu thers.

he himselfe had to do. Thus it is not yet agreed among our Romanists whose is the primary authority to commaunde, convent and congregate Councels, and therefore you in your very extraordinary wisedome and modesty declining this doubt, tell vs onely that these Councels must be confirmed by the See Apostolike. He would haue a Negatiue voice to repell them when they haue decreed & done what they meant to do. Now these two observations being made, we trace your other steps.
               3 Your words are liable to many exceptions. For first when heresies sprung vp, there were not evermore Councels gathered as is evident by that time which was before the Nicene Councel held vnder Constantine; and yet betweene the daies of the Apostles and that Emperour, there were many heresies stirring as may be seene by In haeres.

of the Church, that without the sentence, or advise of the Bishop of Rome, decrees for the Church should not be established. But this is spoken by him, as taking it vp only from some claime of Iulius the stirring Pope then living, and not from anie authenticall recorde. For where was that ever concluded? The Nicene Councell indeede taking order that there might be Patriarkes in severall places of the world, who might compose and direct Ecclesiasticall matters in their Provinces, had for the respect which was then borne to Rome, as being the Imperial city, suffered the Bishop thereof to take the first Socr. 5. 8. place in all generall Convocations, as it gaue the seconde to the Patriarke of Constantinople, and afterward to the other Patriarks in their order. Further prerogatiue we finde none given, howsoever the Bishops of Rome aspiring to an Ecclesiasticall Monarchy did in processe of time stand on it, that they had more. In a Concil. carthaginens, 3. Councell at Carthage it was decreed that the Bishop of the first See should not be called the Prince of Priests, or the highest Priest or any such thing, but only the Bishop of the first See. And Part: 1: Distinct. 99: 3: Gratian citeth the very same words, out of a Councell of Afrike, which intendeth that of Carthage, but he addeth in the end of the Decree, But let not even the Bishop of Rome hee called Universall.

But to returne to Iulius in whose behalfe the former chalenge was made, when the Easterne Bishops had received imperious letters from him, they did no lesse then scorne it in him, & would not indure any such vsurpation of his, as both Lib: at

                   Socrates and Lib: 3: 7. Sozomen do relate. Yea we finde in Athanasius himselfe, who had fled to lulius, & whō it cōcerned that lulius shuld haue nothing of his true authority diminished, because he stuck close to Athanasius in his toubles, that the Athana. in Apolog. 2. Easterne Bishops assēbled in the Coūcel at Sardis, do cal Iulius their beloved fellow servant & nothing more. Which was the phrase not only of thē being a cō
                  pany of Catholiks & Orthodox Bishops, but Epistol, 3: Cypriā before that did vse to cal Cornelius the Rom. Bishop his brother & no more.
               4 Yet if it should be graūted that the Patriarkes in the name & behalfe of their Provinces should haue a voice of necessary cō
                  sent, what is that more to the Romish Bishops then to the other Patriarchical Sees? And besids this, the place of Socrates tēdeth to nothing but political ordinances, ceremonies & customes for governmēt of the church, which were not to be obtruded on all without cōsent of some chief in every Province, & especially that of Rome, the most eminēt in the empire. And of that nature was the cause of Athanasius there, who was questioned as depriueable of his Bishoptik, because he had exercised his fūctiō & iurisdictiō, being not restored again after his suspensiō by a Synod of some Bish. But if that a general Coūcel should with good groūds out of the word of God cōdēne heresie, and the Pope would not ioine with thē, whether this cōdemnatiō were lawful or no, is rather our questiō. Where although your Popes wil take on thē to haue a Negatiue voice against the Coūcel, & your Canonists & Pope-flaterers so dispute it, yet the Coūcel of Cōstāce is flat to ye cōtrary: for there as In Ioh. 24. Platina saith, the Pope is subiected to ye Coū cel, yea & deprived by it also. And the conc

Thus the Coū

Christendome had nothing to do with it, neither did they send thither. The Protestants vniversally refused, and some gaue out the reason of it in Sleid, l. 16. printed tracts. First because it was assembled by the Pope, whose authority they should haue ratified, if they had come at his call. Secondly the Legats of the Pope were Presidents there; therfore nothing was to be concluded or disputed against their maister. Thirdly no man could come there but he must condescend to many things against his conscience, there being first and principally required obedience to the Papacy, & presence at many Idolatrous Acts. Fourthly there was no freedome

Mary in all her time sent not thither, which may appeare by this, that in the Cataloge of Bishops ther is named but only one of England, & that was Th. Goldwel Bishop of S. Asaph, who departed the Realm in Q. Elizabeths time, & was at Trēt at a snatch of that assembly, cōming before the final breaking vp of all: but he was thē only a titulary Bish. without any Bishoprik.

He bestowed those titles on those two poore men while they lived at Rome, & had nothing in the world to doe with the places of their pretended Bishopriks, but were without Church, or Clergy, or Diocesse, or any revenue at all. He might as well haue created thē Bishops of Antioch and Alexandria, if he had pleased. These two poore hungrye soules the Pope for a vvhile mainetained barely at Rome: at last as men comming out of far parts of the world he sent thē to Trent, allowing Olaus 15. crownes a month, which as the Authour saieth vvas but a simple pittaunce for an Archbishop,

and especially for him who was called Magnus, but to Venantius that pretended Armachanus he allowed lesse. Was not this thinke you to goe a begging for Bishops, to furnish vp this high and famous Councell, when such simple shiftes vvere made? He who put out the Councel, of likelyhood was sore ashamed of it, and therefore in his commemoration of the Bishoppes there assembled, he mencioneth no such men, but leaveth them both out as counterfeits.
               6 I returne to speake of Popish Princes. Among all of that part in Germany, much of the Country yet to this day standing Romishly affected, there came Bishops but Cat. prael: in fine Cōc two, if we shoulde afford thē their own reckoning. But almost no place was neerer to Trent then France was. And yet L. Antiguizart. Francis the Great, who lived at the first meeting of that cōciliable, had his Orator or Embassador there, that was the Abbot of Bellozan, who in the name of his master protested, that neither the King nor any of his Realm could be bound by the decrees of that Coūcel. The Author writing this addeth farther, that the king knew that the assēbly was provided for the particular profit of some few, & not for the cō
                  mōwealth of Christēdōe. The like was afterward done by Hēry the 2. K. of Frāce strēgthned by the autority of al his Parliamēts, who haue stil opposed thēselues against the executiō of the Trē
                  tish decrees, as being abusiue & ful of Nullities. Yet the same Hēry obtained of the Gent: 1: 3: Swicers, Papists & al, that they should not consent to that Coūcel. Truth it is that Declar. du Roy deNavar. premier Recutil. Charls the 9. did send to the Pope to prolong the Synode, & having obtained so much, did send his Legats & Bishops to Trent, with large Instructions for the reformatiō of the Clergy, wherin whē they had labored for the space of 18. months, & could get nothing yeelded vnto, the K. informed therof, caused the to protest against that Coūcel, & to come their waies: which they did immediatly, notwithstādīg great means made by the Pope, & the Cardinal of Lorraine who bore thē grand sway in Frāce, to returne againe. So they signed not the Decrees of the Coūcel, & yet cūnīgly they are put in the Cataloge, 26. Frēch Prelats, as if ther amōg others had cōfirmed all. Such frauds be in the papacy. And as there in presence it was reiected by the Frēch, so it stood, afterward in so Ibidem. much that in the

yeare 1572. when after the horrible Massacre was committed, time seemed much to favor it, it was propounded in the Parliament at Paris, all the Chambers being assembled, that this Coū
                  cell might be admitted in France, but it was then also repudiated. Much in like manner was done to that purpose, in the Gent. l:

So that well you may take on you to be a foolish Prophet, and say that hereafter it will be thus and thus received, but for ought that any man else can see, this good Councell is as like to goe backward as forward. To returne here to the famousnesse of this Conventicle, Greeke Prelates there in the Catalogue are said to be sixe, which I conceiue to be such as in the name of the Venetians had Bishopricks on the farther side of the Adriatike sea, called in times past by the generall name of Greece, or else in some of the Ilands neere the bottome of Greece, but subiect to the Venerians. For of any who truly were of the Greek Church, I do not finde any mention. Of other nations of Christendome (the Italians and Spanyards being excepted) there is no countrey which had more then three, some two, divers but one, and yet we must allow their own account, and take Bishops for tales quales, at Goldwell was, to say nothing of Olaus: and any man who in that eighteene yeare peeped into Trent shall be nūbred for one. For Spanyards it is said of them that they were 31. And the lesse to be wondered at, since many things were there brued in behalfe of their maister, and if we will beleeue De Rep. lib:

               7 But that which much commendeth this Tridentine Convocation, was the excellent number of Italian Prelates got thither: who being vnder the Popes nose; and fit to helpe at a pinch, are said there to haue bin to the number of 187. Where a man of cō
                  mon sence may very wel smile, that out of Italy which for quantity of grounde containeth no more then the two Realmes of England and Ireland, there may come more then ninescore Bishops. Wherein we must doe well to giue a favourable interpretation, that peradventure some one pretty Bishopricke might yeeld towarde the reckoning two men or more, one beeing at Trent in the beginning of the Conventicle, another in the middle, & a third might be there in the end. But otherwise the truth is, that Italy hath many base and pety Bishopriks, of little circuit of ground and of smal commodity, which was long since observed, when the In remedijs Grava. German. Germanes in their complaints against the Papacy, could say that divers ordinary benefices in Germany, were of more yearly worth and commodity then many Bishopriks in Italy. Of these little hungry minims, at a beck of the Popes came vp so many at the end of the Coūcell, as they alone being a maior part of voices, were able by farre to overbeare all the rest of Christendome, which were there present.

For thē & after that, as appeareth by the calculatiō of the time, there were in the Sleid. l. 17 meeting, besides the Cardinals which were the Popes Legats there, and the Cardinal of Trent & Pachecus the Spanyard, foure Archbishops wherof the poore & sterneling titulary Olaus & Venantius before named were two, Bishops 33. wherof two were French, fiue.

Those whom you call new fellowes are able to proue every part of their profession to be more ancient then your vn-Catholike superstition. Your reasons why we cannot continue, do halt on every foote. We cannot call a Councell, Ergo we cannot continue. A simple Antecedent, and a childish Consequent. And why I pray you may not the Princes & governors of the Reformed kingdomes and States of Europe, as well assemble a Councell as the Popish Princes may? Yea and so much the better a Synode, because disputation and conference may be free, as being out of the worde of God, and not restained within the limits of your Popes pleasure. Then how can you proue that it is of the necessity of religion, that Generall Councels should be called? May not Provinciall assemblies serue the turne, for setling severall lands and countries, as they haue done before? It is de benè esse of religion, that there should be great meetings if there be cause, & they be lawfully called, and orderly proceeded in, but it is not de esse. Else if there had arose no Act. 15. 6. variance in the time of the Apostles, which was the cause of their meeting, their religion might haue sunke. Your next proposition is as weake, that we can decide nothinge without a head. We haue a head and that is Christ: and his Spirit is his Vice-gerent to supply his place, and this Spirit will not be wanting to those who rightly & earnestly pray for him. And we haue also asquire to direct all by, that is the written word: we remember Christs speech, Ioh.

                  Counsailer, such are to be much reverenced and esteemed, but yet still as the words of men, and not immediatly of God. For it is one thing to be the word of God; and another to be guided by it. The former great Councels did take the sacred Oracle for the load starre of their direction, the later Mat. 26. 3. Annas-like assemblies, and Cayphas-like Councels did least thinke of such matters. And therefore it may rightly bee saide that not the holy Ghost, but Sathan in the likenesse of such a Nicol. de Clem super materia Concilior. filthy bird as appeared at Rome in the Councel called by Iohn the foure & twētith, was President there. Yet we hold it worth the while, to looke a little into your doctrine concerning Councels. You make them of mighty authority as anone I shall shew, and yet the chiefe Patriarkes among you who boast so much of your Vnity and Consent, cannot agree which be the Councels whom you plead for to be authenticall. It is no marvell if your scholers cannot ye eld account of their faith, when you their Masters cannot. You for your part allow vs eighteene Generall Councels, but you doe not make vs so much beholding to you, as to tel vs which they be. In initio Platinae. Ounphrius who was held for a great Clerke among you, reckoneth but sixteene, the fowre first of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus and Chalcedon; then two other at Constātinople, then the second at Nice, then a fourth at Constantinople, then one at Laterane, the next at Lions, then at Vienna one, afterwards those of Constance, Basile and Florence, then another Laterane, & the last at Trent.

Thus the greatest Rabbins cannot agree among themselues. All the stirre is about those of Constance and Basile, who indeed do touch the Popes freehold, and therefore himselfe, and all the Parasites who stand for him, are not hastily to admit thē. The Coūcel of Cōstance did dosse three Popes which were vp at once in a schisme, & subiected the Bish. of Rome to a Coūcel, which goeth hard, & especially when the Synode may be called without him, as that was: & therefore he wil none of that.

                      of our Lady as you cal it, wherof what the Frāciscane Friers

will thinke, I leane to your consideration. By this, men may see how wise the Pope is, who will surely liue without his damme, if we will let him alone, when albeit all the Prelates of Christendome come togither and determine that which is good for the regiment of the Church, yet if it touch the Pope he will stande to nothing. Nay if Martin say yea, & confirme it, Leo comming after will say No, and vndoe it. So that let the Councel pray and talke what they wil of the holy Ghost being among them, if the Popes holy spirit do not agree with theirs, their holy Ghost is nothing. Somewhat it was that Pope Platin ain Faschal. 2: Paschall did put on a girdle whence 7. keyes and 7. seales did hang, that he might advertise men that according to the seven fold graces of the holy Spirit, he had power to close and seale, and open and shut the holie Churches over whom by Gods appointment he was ruler. That you must thinke to be all the world, and by a consequent the generallest Councell. Open your eies Papists, and see whither that these doctrines be not the mockery of all religion. You were as good take a compendious course, and say plainely that the Pope may doe what he list, as talke of a Councell and trouble a greate many mē about nothing, & then the resolutiō must be with Centu. 16 in An. 1518 Silvester Prierias, that the Popes authority is farre before the Coū
                  cels, yea that the force of the sacred Scripture doth depend vpon the authority of the Pope, or with Ibidem. Caietane the Cardinall who in a Conference with Luther at Auspurge did directly preferre the power of the Pope before al Scriptures and Councels, which Luther good man would not beleeue. I pray you gentle Doctor suffer your selfe to be coniured so farre as on your honesty to tell me, whither you or we do attribute most to a Councel, when we teach that many comming togither in the feare of God, and sincerely vsing the best meanes that they possibly can, and beeing directed by Gods spirit & word, may conclude that which must stand good: and you say that be they never so many, so learned, so holy, & do they what they wil, yet if the Pope like not of it, (& he will not like any thing that shall binde him to any goodnes) it is not al worth a straw.
               10 I cannot here omit, that the milke which you gaue in the beginning of this Chapter, is nowe cast downe by your owne

heele. I cōmended you too soone. A black More cannot change his skinne, and you will to your owne biace. Here the Councels were not only allowed and confirmed by one and the selfe same authority, and this you meane to be your Popes, but they are gathered also. The impudencie of this Proposition, which in a worde you thinke to steale away with, I haue shewed before. The Bishoppe of Rome durst neither for his head, nor soule haue saide such a word, in the time of the Primitiue Church. He should haue been most arrogant before God, and a rancke traytour to the Emperor his best master, if he had assumed that vnto him. I helped you even now with a place out of Socrates: let mee now quit that with another. Thus then he saith, Soc in pro aemio lib. 5. 
                  I haue everywhere in my storie made mention of the Emperours, becacause since that time that they began to be Christians, the businesse of the Church did seeme to depende vpon th

                      and the greatest Councels were by their sentence or order called together, and yet are so called. Alas, there was no token of the prety Popes supreame authority in cōvocating such Occumenicall assemblies, till almost a thousande yeares after Christ. Afterwarde when the Pope had got the head, he began to bee a little bold: but his Dictates were only attended in such places of the West, as over which he had vsurped a spirituall dominion. But the Greeke and Easterne Church tooke no notice of those assemblies more then of factious and partiall Conventicles; which is the true cause that at the Councell of Florence (which was cunningly got togither by Eugenius the 4. to toppe that of Coch hist. Huss. lib. 9. Basile held at the same time, and which was assembled before by his owne authority, but afterward thwatted some of his designes) the Greekes did take no notice of any of the Synodes at Laterane, Lions or Vienna, where their ancestours before had not beene: but only they tooke knowledge of such as whither the Greekes their predecessours had freely gone. And therefore as Li. 4. Chr. Genebrarde saith, they who came to the meeting at Florēce, count that the eighth Synode, which is to be vnderstood, if they hold it for a Synode at all. And in the Scss. 5. & 6. Councell of Florence it selfe, the seconde helde before at Nice was then called by the Greekes the last Generall Councell, and speciall exception was taken to that which is commonlye called the eighth Generall

Coūcel, albeit it was held at Cōstātinople, they saying first that it never was at all received, and secondly that afterward it was formerly abrogated. For in as much as it had condemned Pho
                  
                     •
                  ius Patriarke of Constantinople, his successour Iohn called another Synode and antiquated the former. Marke here that the Patriarke of the Greeke Church thinketh that he hath power to assemble Councels, directly opposite to the proceedings of the Romish Bishop, and that he challengeth to himselfe authoritie, to dissolue and annullate that which he supposeth the Western Patriarke with others his consorts to haue done either vsurpingly or vniustly. So that very true it is, that the Greekes do not allow the eighth Synode, not the other which followed and were held in the west, by the meanes of the Romane Bishop, & with out their indifferent concurrence.
               11 What you cite in the name of the Lutheranes, out of the Magdeburgenses is acknowledged, and consented vnto by vs. In the eighth 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      cent: 8. 9: Century, they among other Provincial meetings  speaking of the confluence at Nice, which is commonly called the second Nicene Councell, in the setting downe thereof doe not dissemble their opiniō, that is their dislike vnto it. And what  Christian man is there rightly advised, which hath read the Exod. 20. second commandement concerning Images, who doth not both dislike and detest that Conventicle, for decreeing both erection and adoration of Images in Churches? In the like sorte in the ninth cent: 9. 9: Century, the compilers of it do shew themselues not wel affected to that which you call the eighth Generall Councell, & they haue no smal reason for it. For besides the allegations of the Greekes against it, which even now is specified, and besides the matter of it, which I will not stand to discusse, there was a foule attempt at the very entrance into it. The Pope of Rome had so farre prevailed, that he had there his Agents who stoode at the Councell dore with writing tables, profering them to all who would enter there, and requiring that they first should subscribe to the Iutisdiction and transcendent authority of the Romane Bishop. To which Such as yeelded did enter in: and those who refused were not only repelled, but it was done with much reproach and disgrace vnto them. A fit course to make a free Synode.

And of this sort either directly or indirectly haue all the Popes Councels bin. You tel vs that some Eutychians be in Asia, and Nestorians be in the East, whereas indeed Asia is in the East: but countrey in particular you name vs none, nor authour you cite vs none. I haue heard indeed of Marchantes who haue travailed in those parts, that at this day there is at Aleppo a Cō
                  gregation of Nestorians, and likely it is that in the country therabout, or farther of in Armenia, there may be more. Neither is it vnlikely, but that some also may embrace the old heresie of Eutyches in those parts. In as much then as Nestorius was condemned in the third General Socn 7. 33 Evagr. 1. 4. Coūcel at Ephesus, it is probable that his folowers wil refuse that Synode, & consequently all cōming after & ratifying that, & so they must only accept the 2. formost. And since Eutyches & Dioscorus were cōdēned in the 4. Evagr. 2. 4 Coū
                  cel at Chalcedō, it is most credible that if there now be any who haue cōtinued or revived their dānable heresies, they wil not approue that of Chalcedon, but only such as went before it. What such in Polonia & Hungary do, as speake against the Trinity, & therefore are rather to be called Antitrinitarij then Trinitaries, 
                  
                     •…
                  it mattereth not to vs. We disclaime thē, we abominate thē, we execrate thē, as we do the Eutychians & Nestorians, & al other heretiks. Neither do we ioine with the Greekes in all things as you know, although some of their doctrins we prefer before those of the Church of Rome. And therefore most ridiculously & vnfittingly do you close vp your Chapter, Behold the liberty of your Gospell, when here are none named, the Lutheranes excepted, vvith whom we haue ought to do. And for our liberty in the Gospel, of reiecting such vnwarrātable stuffe, as Image-worshipping, Trā
                  substantiatiō & the like, maintained by your heretical meetings, we learne it of Gal:

                  stand fast in that liberty wherewith Christ hath made vs free. VVee accept therefore of this Christian freedome, but Libertine-like licentiousnesse vvee leaue vnto you. And so for a

litle while I dismisse you, with this remembrance, that what you say of the Coūcels accepted or excepted against, by the Greeks, the Lutheranes, the Eutychians, the Nestorians, and the Trinitarians, both for the matter and quotations you borrow frō Cardinall Coacil: l. 1. cap: 5. Bellarmine.
               12 TO notifie then the iudgement of our Church concerning Coūcels; certainly we do hold them being rightly & lawfully assembled & proceeded in, to be great blessings frō God, & notable meanes to remoue schismes & to extirpate heresies.

                  wee doe so receiue the foure Synodes of the holye Universall Church, as the foure bookes of the holy
                  
                  Gospell. If it be flatly and directly taken, it is a hard and vnfit saying, & it is wel, that it is but one Doctors opiniō, since the words of men, yea of all the world put togither cannot be ballanced in equall waight, with the immediate word of God, which is so directly inspired by the holy Ghost. A sweet childe the while was our Campian, Ration: 4: who would take on him to proue, that the rest of the Synods, & namely that of Trent was of the same authority with those foure first, and so consequently all as powerfull as the Gospels. By which reconing wee should not only haue a fifth Gospell of Nicodemus, or some such counterfeit, but eighteene Gospels more besides the foure Evāgelists, & so our Bibles now will grow so big, that one volume wil not hold thē. What a wrōg did that prowde and arrogant Iesuite to the Scripture, when hee durst write on that fashion? we dare not so far dignifie or rather magnifie the best Councels (after that in the Apostles time) for feare of blasphemy. But if we shall compare the better with the worser, the weaker with the stronger, we shall see that we are not to far to leane on such assemblies, least by attributing over much to such confluences, we sometimes take error for verity. For haue there not bin meetings which haue concluded against the truth, & yet haue caryed a goodly shew too? I wil not insist on Provinciall Councels, as that of Inter opera Cyptiā. A frike, where Cyprian & the rest cō
                  cluded for rebaptising of those which were baptised by heretiks, or that of Soc. 1: 21. Tyrus which proceeded against Athanasius being innocēt, or that of Lib: 2: 7. Antioch, as also of cap. 25. Sirmiū both which decreed for the Arrians, against the faith of Consubstantiality in Christ with his Father. I will rather stand on those who go for generall, as that of Sardis in part reiected by In Indice conciliorū. Possevinus, that of Milaine where were 300. Bishops ioyning for Arrianisme, that of Selētia being gathered to the same purpose. Here may you finde more general Synods making for the Arrians while they were in anye strength, then making against them.
               13 Lay to these the Great Councell of Ariminum, vvhere vvere sixe hundred Bishoppes mainetaining and decreeing for the opinion of Arius, and the authoritye vvhereof seemed to bee so greate, and vvas so farre vrged, that Saint Augustine himselfe had beene everborne vvith it, had hee not beene forced

to flie to the Scriptures, which were and are the touch-stone to trye Councels by. The place which he hath to that purpose is famous, Aug contra Maxim. Arrian Episcop. l. 3: 
                  But now neither shoulde I produce the Nicene Councell, nor thou that of Ariminum as meaning to extoll it. Neither am I helde vvith the authoritie of the one, nor thou vvith the other. VVith authorities of Scriptures, vvhich are vvitnesses not proper to either, but common to both, let matter contend with matter, cause vvith cause, reason with reason. Both of vs doe reade, That vvee may be in his true sonne Iesus Christ, He is very God & life eternal, Let both of vs yeeld to waight of so great moment. These are the words of the same S. Austē, who els-where had said, Epist: 118: 
                  The authority of Plenary Coūcels is most wholesome in the Church. Very whole some while they keepe right with the verity of Christ, but whē they fal frō that, they are otherwise. But S. Austē was never of opiniō to atrribute too much to Coū
                  cels: for he was not so simple but that he saw there were or might be many imperfectiōs in thē, yea in the best of thē. It is a worthy testimony which he gives in this behalf, whē he was pressed with the authority of Cypriā & the Africane Coūcel. De Bap

                  The sacred Scripture saith he is not at alto be doubted or desputed of. The letters of Bishops writē since the Scripture if there be any errour in thē may be reprehēded by the wiser speech of any one who is more skilful in that matter, & by the graver authority of other Bishops, & by the wisedome of the more learned, & by Councels. And who knoweth not that Provincial Councels without any sticking do yeeld to the authority of plenary Councels, which are gathered out of the whole Christian world, yea & that oftentimes the former Plenary Coūcels are amended by the later, when by any experiēce of things, that is opened which was shut, & known which did lye hid, without any vanity of sacrilegious pride, without any puffed necke of arrogācy, without any contention of malicious envy, with holy humility, with Catholike peace, with Christian charity. And some part of this he cōfirmeth againe afterward, Among after-cōmers, the later Coūcels are preferred 
                  Cap. 9.

                  cels may be amēded & altered: therfore they may erre, or come to short. Which wil the better appeere if we remēber that sometimes one Councel is directly contrary to another, as that of Ariminum to the former of Nice, that of Franckforde touching

Images, to the later at Nice, those of Constance & Basile in the subiecting of the Pope to the Councel, to those of Florence and Trent, the 2. at Ephesus approving Eutyches, to that of Chalcedō which cōdēned him. Yea the Socrat. 2. 16. Coūcel of Sardis against it self, whē the Easterne Bishops were for Arrianisme, the Westerne against it, whervpō they devided thēselves in place as wel as in opiniō. It were thē a hard matter in an vnavoidable cōtrariety or rather cōtradictiō, to have both sorts of Coūcels allowed, the affirmer & the denier: & therfore simply, absolutly & of thēselues they are not to be held for sufficient cōfirmers of that which we must beleeve. It may bee added as another singular exception against Coūcels, that most of thē are hādled with such irregularities, that it is not only probable that they may swarve, but likely that they wil, since even the best men, & to the best Coūcels do come so laden with passions, affections, humours & partialities, that they wil not or cannot see the truth. One of the most moderate of all the Popish Councels was that of Basile, & yet what turbulētnes doth De Concil. Basilcens. Aeneas Sylvius witnes there to haue bin? He therfore in that argumēt is rather to be reade, thē that which cō
                  mōly goeth for the Coūcel of Basile, as In Indice falcic: rerum expet. & fugiend. Orthuinus Gratius wel observeth, for in Aeneas who was present at that meeting, and saw and recorded all the manner of it, a man may find the order or disorder of it so described, that he may imagine himselfe to behold the Fathers there assembled sitting in their Pōtificalibus. If we would haue an exāple of this in an olde Synode, let it be the Coūcel of Socrat. 7. 33. Ephesus, which is one of the foure Oecumenical great ones. For there was not onely a clamourous division for a good space betweene Cyril Bishop of Alexandria, & the other Orthodoxe Bishops on the one side, and Nestorius with his hereticall Prelats on the other side, eche maintaining their faction, & proceeding to deprive eche other of their Bishoprikes, but Iohn Bishop of Antioch although Catholikein opiniō, groweth out with Cyril also, that he had fel to sentencing Nestorius before Iohns cōming, whervpō Cyril ioyning with him Iuvenal the Bishop of Hierusalem, proceedeth to deprive Iohn also of his Bishoprike. But afterward Iohn returning to Antioch, & callīg to him many Bish. falleth to the deprivatio of Cyril who was now returned to

Alexandria. And that these and the like tumultuous fashions were not rarely but commonly vsed in other Councels, we need no better witnesse then Gregory Epist: 55: Nazianzen, whose wordes touching this matter are these, I am of this 
                        •…
                     nde, of I must write that which is truth, that I doe flie all Councels of Bishops, because no mā yet could ever see ende of Synode to any profit, and whereby things which were ill were not more exacerbated then cured. For there is in them such a desire of contention, and such an ambition of dominering (doe not thinke me to write these things odiously and vnreasonably in this manner) and they are so impossible to be overcome in disputation, that if one will deale iudiciously with them, hee shall sooner bee helde guilty of some other evill then convince and cleere that which is theirs. This is the sentence of him who was very wise and learned, and in whose time diverse Synodes were aslembled, so that he might speake vpon sounde experience. Thus men are, and ever haue beene men, and where such faction, contention, emulation, ambition, malice, bitternes is, may it not be well presumed, that the sacred Spirite of God in respect of any immediate and extraordinary influence of truth, may as well be absent as present? What then can certainely and warrantably be grounded herevpon?
               14 If this yet doe not satisfie, wil you heare the reasons of one, whom by his owne words you may thinke to be a Calvinist, and yet he was what he was, long before Luther was borne. This partye whom I produce is the Arch-deacon Nicolaus de Clemangijs, who taketh on him to dispute whether in matters of fact a generall Councell may

                  rre or no? For that it cannot erre in matters of faith or rather that it cannot finally faile wee are saith he, to beleeue. But let the Readeriudge, whether hee doe not pointe shrewdly at that erring also, and whether his reasons beat not as fully to that, as to the other. I must drawe into a narower roome, that which he vttereth more at large, but yet so as to keepe his owne words, Disputat. super materia Concilior general

For by singling out those fowre, he leaveth in mens mindes a doubtfull suspicion of the rest If a Councel cannot erre, how may that rule of the Lawyers be vnderstood, that the Militant Church oftentimes doeth deceiue and is deceived? And how doth the Militant Church and triumphant in

                      if it be, then it is in the state of deserving ill or well, and may doe right or otherwise. That the Church cannot faile in faith, we haue a testimonie from Christ, Peter I haue praied for thee that thy faith faile not, but for other things I remem ber no such lesson. For that out of the Gospell convinceth little, where two or three are gathered togither in my name, there am I in the middle of them. For they may be deceived amonge whom Christ is. Iohn the Baptist said of him to the Pharisees, He was among you, and yet they vvere deceived, and he was among the Iewes when he was crucified and spit vpon. And what madde man will say, that they could not be deceived? Againe of what assistance of Christ is that to be vnderstoode, if of his assistance by the presence of his divinitie, that is every where, and is nothing to this matter. If of the assistance by his grace, howe will it followe that where two or three come togither to confer about the peace of the Church or any other good, Gods grace should presently br infused in them, whē before they haue perhaps committed many sinnes where of they haue nether had compunction nor made confession. For thus some doe come togither, and either so presently with the comming their sinnes are blotted out, or else it is not necessarie that they should haue grace infused. But suppose they haue grace, will that make them that they cannot sinne, that they cannot goe awry by ignorance, or by some passion blinding them? Grace moueth to doe well, but doth not inforce or put in an inevitable necessity. If you vnderstand it of assistance by direction inwardly, that is given only to holy men who are filled with the spirit. Againe, Councels many times are gathered to alay schismes between Popes, & to make peace in the Church vvhieh perhaps God hath so interrupted, that hee may doe good to the Church, to purge it from pride, covetonsues, vanity, simony. Now it commeth not from Christ, that men should desire only the externall peace of the Church, for so doe many carnall men at this day, that themselues living in idlenesse and rest, they may freely serue their owne wils. And who will say that these are gathered in the name of Christ, who for this ende seeke the vnity of the Church? Yet of these there are so many as are scant to be numbred; carnall children of the Church, who care for nothing that is spirituall, may persecute those who are after the spirite, Such as for tē
                     peral things come to the Church, hypocrites, eaters vp of Christ crucified, and of these is the Church so full, that in Chapters or Colledges you can
                  
                  hardly finde other. And of these as being the wisest fellowes are those who are sent to Rome & Princes Courtes, to generall Councels, & these vpō hope of greater promotion doe labor that they may be sent. And are these such who will come to reforme the Church, who only desire that freely thē selues may do what they list. But before peace & iustice can be there must be such are formation in the Church. He that seeketh outward peace before spiritual peace, doth as if he should build a house without a foundatiō. They who were assembled at the Councell of Pisa, said they had broughte peace to the Church, and gaue it out to the world, when there was no such matter. Do you thinke then whither they were deceived or not? and so a Councell may be deceivid. The holy Ghost directeth thē who haue fitted themselues as aledging to intertaine him by good workes. But how should he visite them who thwarte the spirite, and seeke to extinguish him in other men? which in steede of the fire of charity are inflamed with the heat of ambition? These will heare nothing which is contrary to their own lust, and taste nothing of spirituall giftes, and come with a false hart to handle Gods businesses, seeking those thinges vvhich are their evvne and not Gods, which if Paule coulde say of his time, we may much more say of the dregs of our daies. With such the holye Ghost is not: and such stubborne ones woulde not yeelde to the motions thereof. Now if the Spirit bee not with such, and the greatest part of Councels consist of such, and there the Decrees are made by the maiour parte of voices, may not Councels erre? I speake not this of the present Councell at Basile, for there I heare mante good thinges are handled: but yet I heare there bee many things there vvhich shoulds not bee, contentions, emulations, heart-burnings, clamours which the Spirite doeth not desire. There had neede be good men sent to Councels, that God may bee amonge them. The ancient Fathers did vse vvith praying, fasting and vveeping to begge at Gods hande, that his Spirite mighte bee present at Councels amonge them, to direct them, which they needed not to haue done, if they ware sure that hee coulde not bee absent. UUee reade in the Scripture that for one mans sinne, an armie of Gods freindes hath beene overthrowne. One sicke sheepe infecteth a vvhole flocke. And since on one mans sentence or voice, the vvhole assemblie dependeth, may not he both be deceived and deceiue a vvhole Councell? To doe all thinges vvell and never to erra is onelye the parte of GOD; but the vvorlde knovveth that men are not Gods, not Angels, but such as of vvhome it is saide.
                  
                  All men are lyers. They are subiect to passions and ignoraunces, which overtake men the more, when by vaine pride they vvoulde put them from them. If you saie that it resteth not on humane infirmitie, but it is of the povver of the holye Ghost, that the Councell cannot bee deceived, vvho is certaine that vvith the maiour parte of the Councell vvhich must preponderate, the holye Ghost is present? If you sa
                        •…
                     e it is likelye the spirite is in some sevve, and they may vvorke the rest to the right, what if the multitude haue deserved to be deceived? So Micheas could doe no good on all Achabs Prophets. And who knoweth whither the maiour parte of the Councell bee vvorthie to bee deceived or no? God in Ieremie did for sake the temple vvherein the levves did trust, and hee badde the Prophet that hee shoulde not pray for them, for he would not heare him. Therefore good mens praiers doe not alvvaies obtaine for the wicked. Yea but hee hath promised to bee vvith his Church to the ende of the vvorlde. But hee alone knovveth vvho they are that haue grace in his Church. The Lorde knovveth vvho, are his. The Church by grace may remaine in one onelye vvoman, as in the time of the passion it did onelye in the Uirgin Marie. Shall a Councell now bee of greater authoritye then all the Apostles vvere? And yet they all declined at Christes death, and vvere afraide. Shall is bee greater then all the militant Church, of vvhich Augustine saide that heere it cannot bee vvithout spotte or vvrinckle, but in the nevv Hierusalem it must be. What should be the reason that the foure first Coūcels specially be in such estimation with all, but that there were better men, then sinca haue bin, & they framed thēselues to aske what the spirit was willing vnto? These late ones are Coūcels of blend, & assemble about such things as flesh & bloud only would haue them. Then he telleth the tale how at Rome in a Councell a little before gathered by Iohn the 24. an Owle appeared looking directly vpō the Pope, to the amasemēt of some to the great scorne of other. Then he proceedeth, By the vnworthines of the head or the maior part, the Coūcel may misse of a good end other such causes there may be, as too much listning to tēporal peace, or too much presūptrē of their own grace & wisdome, or negligence of looking into the word of God. It is good therfore that they who meete in such assemblies be not too bold. In another Tract. priore de materia Conc. Generalis. treatise of this same argumēt, he had warned before, that men should not say as of likelyhood some did, Wee are a Generall Councell, let vs goe to it boldelye, vv
                        •…
                     
                  
                  
                  cannot erre. What Papist will not think that this man in the matter of Coūcels is more a Calvinist thē Calvin himselfe. Let these reasons be well waighed, and then iudge whither too much bee to be attributed to Councels, besids those flawa & cracks which I formerly mentioned, as who are to call Councels, who are to haue voices in Councels, whither the Pope be to be subiected to a Councell or no, which the Pope and all his flatterers cannot endure.
               15 He who list to knowe more of the Popes challenge touching his owne calling and overbalancing Councels, let him looke the censure of Hist. Hussit l. 9: Cochleus vpon the Synode at Basile. There hee affirmeth that assembly to be but a Conciliable or Conventicle, after that Pope Eugenius had given out his summons, that hee woulde haue that meeting to bee removed to Ferrara first, but afterward to Florence, else there had beene at one time two general Councels, and consequently two Churches. Also, that the fathers at Basile with their Antipape Felix, were for eight yeares in a schisme against Eugenius, and yet they gaue out that they had the holy Ghost among them. That to call a Councell, by ancient right belongeth to the Bishop of Rome. That it pertayneth not to sheepe to iudge their shepheard. But Eugenius himselfe with more maiesty and Pope-like state could say, Ibidem. 
                  To that robbery at Basill, all the Divels of the world doe seeme to haue come togither. To these bracks about Councels, this one farther may be ioyned, that they say a Councell is not good, vnlesse the Pope confirme it. For now how shall we know whether a Synode bee confirmed or no, vnlesse there be some Bull or Decree published concerning that particular, since In Iudice Concilio
                        •…
                     
                   Possevinus the Iesuit in rekoning vp the Councels, nameth foure at A
                     •…
                  les, one at Laodicea, fiue at Orleans, and divers other, which he saith are of greate authority, for although an open confirmation of them be not founde, yet they are allowed of by a secret consent of the Church, and the Popes and Doctors citing them. This is a point which may breede great difficulty, whither that be inough to ratifie a Synode or no. Also it were good that before we make Coūcels a matter of beliefe, we were assured that we haue none, but those which are right in the whole, and in the parts. For Actes of Councels haue bin much

falsified, as it is alleadged in the sixt Generall Councell holden at Constantinople, Action. 14 
                  that some had falsified the Actes of the fifth Generall Councel holden in the same place, as was apparantly deprehended. How those in Afrike did cōplaine of the Popes forsting in somewhat to the first Nicene Synode, I haue shewed before; and how the Councell sent to Nice it selfe to see the Originall. But in the same manner hath the Pope complained, that other haue also falsified the Actes of the same Councell. For Felix Bishop of Rome himselfe hath made this Decree, In Decretis felicis Papae. In Concilijs. 
                  Let the persons of the accusers be without all suspicion, because by reason of the molestations offered by evill men, this was defined in the Nicene Councell by all, although by the falshoode of lewde persons, these and many other things are blotted out. We then had neede to take heede, that wee do: not beleeue those things as certaine, which of themselues are so vncertaine. Let Papists doe it if they wil. Lastly before I shut vp this Chapter it is not amisse to know, that it is not for the ancient Synods that the Romanists doe striue, but for those which lately were helde, wherein their Pope bore much sway, and their Popery was established by fragments. For out of the old Councels both Provinciall and Vniversall, there are many matters contrary to their definitions. As in the thirde Councel at Carthage there is much spoken concerning the children of Priests, which sheweth that Priests then were ordinarily marryed. And there it is that the Pope should not be called the Prince of Priests or chiefe Priest. In the Elibertine Councell is a flat decree against Images in Churches, It 
                  Canon 36 
                  pleaseth vs that pictures should not be in the Churches, least that which is worshipped or adored, should be painted on wals. In the fifth In epistol. felicis. Councell at Constantinople, by an Epistle of Pope Felix to Zeno, it is shewed that the Church is built on the confession of Peter, not on his person or place. In the ninth Councel of Canon. 1. Toledo, if a Metropolitane defraude the Church, complaint thereof is to be made to the king, which sheweth that Princes then had to do with persons and causes Ecclesiasticall. Very many more such instances may be brought, how the old Councels knew nothing of that hart of Popery, which since hath growne vp, by the connivence of some Princes, the weaknes of other, and the notable cunning of Antichrist. And for times now long agone the

extravagancie and transcendencie of the Roman Bishops power is no where knowne. For in the Nicene Canon. 6 Councell, the Bishop of Alexandria in his Province, and the Patriarke of Antioch in his, haue as much iurisdiction as the Pope hath in his. In the Isidor in praefat. Cō
                     cil. Ephesin. Ephesine Synode Cyrill of Alexandria was president, and not the Bishoppe of Rome, and there it is saide that In epistol. ad Nestoriū
                   
                  Peter and Iohn were each to other of equall dignitie, because they were Apostles and holie disciples, which overthroweth the Primacie of the Romane Bishoppe deriving his prerogatiue only from Peters preeminence. And in the Councell of Canon. 1. Chalcedon all is confirmed which was decreed before in other Synodes. Thus the Pope and Papists should gaine much by sending vs to looke into the most ancient Councels.

The silye man had much adoe to learne the names of all these, but for reading any of them, or for knowing what they vvrote, there bee many yet living, who dare safely giue their word, that he good man was never troubled with it. This is the very case of the greatest part of you Papists: you wil speak without the book, and make good little of that which you say: but yet for lacke of chalenging & facing it out, you will loose nothing of antiquity. And among al your copes-mates, as one that knoweth least, and therfore dareth to say most, you lay about you here for al & al againe. You are now come to your selfe, revested with your olde spirite, and therefore wee will looke for a legion of Vniversals at your handes. The vn-Catholike Romane Religion, it is Papistry which you meane, is not onely taught, or plainly taught, but most plainelie taughte, not by some, but by all the ancient Fathers of the first sixe ages after Christ, and hath beene not sometimes but ever, not doubtingly but without all controversie taught of the Fathers of each age vntill this day. If you had a fore-heade lefte, and knevve vvhat you did saye, vvhich I thinke

you doe not, but onely take vp this speech on the word of other men, you would blush a whole yeare togither at this your owne absurdity, and by that time woulde this rubour bee so setled in your face, that it would never out. For, that I may plucke you a little backe by the sleeue, doth Saint Augustine, and, Orosius, & Fulgentius, and Bernard, where they of purpose handle the argument, teach as you do teach cōcerning the freenesse of Gods grace every way, and touching free will? In pref. 1. 5 Bibli. Sāct Sixtus Senensis shall condemne you, who reiecteth Saint Augustines doctrine in that behalfe. Doe Lactantius and Ephiphanius say as you say concerning Images? Doe Clemens Alexandrinus, and Basile, and Gregory Nazianzen, and Chrysostome ioine with you in prohibiting the mariage of the Clergy? Is Theodoret youre in the matter of Transubstantiation, when hee who in the end of his Post Epiphan The. Dialog. Dialogues writeth the Admonition to the Reader, is enforced though hee bee a Papist, to confesse, that hee hath many things against it. Are Tertullian and Saint Augustine of your minde when they expounde This is my body, to meane but the signe or figure of his body? Is Saint Ambrose yours about praying to Saintes? Is Cyprian, yea Gregory himselfe of your iudgement, about the supremacie of Peter and of the Pope? Amongst a hundred examples I doe but touch these things, as having occasion else-where more largely to handle every one of these points. So litle account do you make of truth, being either spurred to it by ignoraunce, or blinded with maliciousnes, both which in you are wonderfully desirous to vpholde your drowping cause.
               2 That Causaeus or Luther doe brande your Dionysius Areopagita for a counterfeit, and speake of him accordingly, we doe not marveile. There was one of that name indeede, an Act. 17. 34. auditor of S. Paule, but these bookes fastened on him, are not worthy of his person. What is there in them all which savoureth of a man taught by an Apostolicall spirit? S. Paule was facile in his vvriting, that the multitude might vnderstand his maine drift every where: this is so obscure that nothing can be darker. S. Paules words were for edification: this is full of vaine curiosity, taking on him to describe every angle and office in heaven. Sainte

                  Col. 2. 18 Paule rebuked those who meddling with the worshipping of Angels, did advance themselues in those things which they never saw: this fellow speaketh of the Angels as if he had been set to take the muster and view of them single from one end of heaven to the other. But his booke De divinis Nominibies doth much display him for a counter feit. For as it may bee well questioned in him, how he could cite the Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans, which was Eue Eccl. hist. li. 3. 30. written but a little before the death of Ignatius; & he was martyred in the time of Traiane
                     •…
                   whereas Dionysius was a man of that age, that long before Saint Pauls death vnder Nero hee was a Senatour of Act 17 34: Athens, or one of their iudges in the streete of Mars: so it cannot be excused that he De divinis nominibus. citeth Clemēt the Philosopher, which being Clemens Alexandrinus did liue almost two hundred yeares after Christ, and therefore this Dionysius citing him was not like to bee the hearer of the Apostle Paule. Now in the eight booke of his Stromata, Clemens indeed doth shew himselfe a Philosopher, yea if you will a Logician, talking of the Predicaments, and naming Relatiues, which is the point for the which this forged Dionysius citeth him. Againe, this booke is dedicated to Timothy Bishop of Ephesus, who being so long a scholer and fellow traveiler with S. Paule, needed not so meane a man, & in so barbarous a fashion to instruct him in those things which this sweete Authour pretendeth. Besides this, if there had beene such an Authour of any worth or name, some of the ancient writers would haue given him some credite, and sometimes haue mencioned him. Eusebius letteth not any man scape who was ought, or left any monument to the church. Notwithstanding he hath not any worde of this Dionysius. S. Hierome came after him, and wrote a Catalog. scripto. Ecclesiastico. treatise purposely of such as before his daies, left any bookes to posterity, where neverthelesse the hame of this Dionysius is not to be found. And so much doth Lib. 6. Bib. Annot 229. Sixtus Senensis himselfe obserue, who also Lib. 2. elsewhere telleth vs, that Cardinal Caietane in his Commentaries on the Acts as also on the thirde of Kings excepteth against this Dionysius, as vnworthy of all credite. There is another treatise in the name of De caelesti Hierarchia. Dionysius which recordeth to vs in particular 9. several orders of Angels. If such a tract had bin known amōg the anciēt, or

had beene of any reputation vvith them, some or other of the olde Fathers speaking of Angels, vpon iust occasion would haue named either it, or the authour, or the matter of it. Haeres. 64 Epiphanius saith that there are more degrees of Angels then one, but howe many hee nameth not. To the same purpose speaketh In Ps. 118. Hilary; but he hath no fixed number. Dialog: 1. Caesarius the brother of Gregory Nazianzen saith that there be seaven orders of Angels. Saint Eucharid. ad Lauren. ca. 58. Austen as wise & learned a man as he was, yet professeth that he knoweth not, what Sedes, & Dominationes, et principatus (word
                     •…
                   by some expounded to bee severall sortes of Angels) do mean. If he had seene that worke of Dionysius, he might haue helped his ignorance; for he describeth thē to an inch, if we will beleeue him. In another place the same Ad Orosium contr. Priscilliā & origenistas Austen writeth thus of himself; That th

But to the ende that you may thinke meanly of me whom you repute to be a great Doctour, what these 
                        •…
                     ee and how they differ amonge themselues I know not. But perhaps it may be obiected that In Questionibus. Athanasius, yea and out of Dionysius, saith that there bee nine orders of Angels. I answere, first that indeede he nameth one Dionysius, & attributeth to him the title of a Divine, but he calleth him, not Areopagita, and therefore hee may meane some other later fellow. Secondly, the treatise containing this, is expunged out of the workes of Athanasius, and put among those that are held to be forged; so that here but one lyer doth speake for another, and then their rewarde is that neither of them ought to be beleeved. Thirdly it agreeth not with an vndoubted place of De cōmuni essent. patris. filij & spi. sanct. Athanasius, for there he rather seemeth to make fiue sorts of Angels, & that with offices differing frō those of Dionysius, as, those that teach, those that permit thinges to bee done, those that punish, those that gratifie souls, and those who remaine with men. Afterward indeede hee mencioneth Thrones, & Cherubins and Seraphins. So that the first who beeing himselfe of any estimation mencioneth Denis, is Gregory the Greate, who in Moral: lib: 32. 18: one place saith that there bee nine orders of Angels, but not a word hath he of Dionysius. And in a In 1. King 14. second place, so much hee doth and no more.

But this is a single testimony, & al other of more antiquity make against him; & he may be supposed to do it doubtfully, since naming the matter thrise he speaketh of Denis but once. And moreover Gregory lived 600. yeares after Christ, by which time this bastard might be a hūdred or two hūdred yeare old, & with some might be esteemed authentical, which Gregory might take vp frō thē without farther examinatiō. He who list to see this Denis farther discovered, & quite discarded, let him look that noble Lib.

We hold them & their labours to be great instruments of the setting forth of Gods glory, & we esteeme it as a good blessing frō aboue, that the Lord hath left their labors as monuments to his church, wherein we not only know what was done & taught in the first ages of the christiā world, but may be helped also many waies in the vnderstāding of Scriptures, & beating downe of divers heresies. And our men do study thē, & are as copious & frequent in thē as Papists be, which if you will, you may see, in the bookes of Bishop Iewel, D. Hūfry, D. Folke, Peter Martyr, Chēnicius, yea M.

                  ody. As for these praises, we neither envy thē nor deny thē to those great lāpes of the first Church, vnlesse it be that of working of miracles, wherof we make a doubt. And by these helps we say that they were wel furnished to vnderstand & expound many things in the Scripture,

as also somewhat by their neerenesse to the time of the Apostles, in those places especially where truth was kepte without mingling. And yet we will you heere to remember that fewe or scant any one of the Fathers had the Scriptures freshly delivered vnto him from the Apostles themselues; you are pitifully out, for diverse hundreds of yeeres came betweene Christes disciples and the most of the olde Doctours: And againe to call to minde, that soone after the Apostles, yea as Eccl. Hist. Lib 3. 26. Eusebius saith, immediately after their death, heretakes came plentifully in, who laboured what they coulde to corrupt the fountaines, whēce all pure water was to flowe. Remember also that for three hundred yeeres by the extremity of persecutiō, the Pastours were few, & they had little liberty to come togither to conferre about thinges questioned, or to follow their studies so much as they would. And yet farther remēber, that some of thē came late frō the Gentiles as Cyprian, some frō heretiks as Eusebius frō the Arriās, & Austē the Manichees, somefrō meere secular callings as Ambrose, & of al these without Gods special grace they might a little participate. Then he is blīd who seeth not, that they had not al those helps, as these haue, whō you cal late & folish & vnstudied, & vnlearned, profane & arrogāt fellowes. These words you vse, when you Doctour Hill are not worthy to be sorted, with the meanest of a thousand among them, which speech without amplification or any diminution may be iustifyed onely in the present Church of England. For first wee have the writinges of all those Fathers themselves, like to which every private man of them had not, no nor all the world neither before their times. Secondly since their daies there be infinite bookes written which give light to matters in controversy. Thirdly our age by meanes of printing hath better facility to come by al bookes thē those ancient times had. Fourthly progres of daies hath made many thīgs plainer to later ages, because they haue bin already fulfilled, thē they could be to former tims, wherin mē did but gesse at thē. Fifthly God hath made the scriptures of such sort, as that mēs wits are to be exercised in thē vntil ye day of iudgmēt, & it belōgeth to that industry which God requireth in his servāts, ye they shold not satisfy thēselues wt the labours of others, & so growidle, bue they shold search farther, &

                     re. Sixthly the helpe of the tōgues is more rife now, then it was amōg the ordinary sorte of them, as may be seene by Athanasius, who was so stūbled in the Prov. 8. 22 8. Chap. of the Proverbs; the Athanas. in decret. Nicen. Synod. Arriās to prove Christ a creature, vrging thence by the trā
                  slatiō of the Septuagint, that it is in the text,

Also Austen had no Hebrew, and both he & Gregory very little Greek, as els-where I have shewed. Now although it be likely that neerest to the fountaines, the waters runne most cleerely, & the farther of, that we are, they are the more likly to be polluted, yet in spirituall thinges that is not to bee vnderstood of place or time but of keeping close to the original of the writen word, and not varying from it.

Austen was more excellent in some of his expositions on the Scripture then Origene, and some other more ancient then himselfe were, Which as both for him & S. Hierome especially in his Cōmētaries on the Prophets you cānot deny, so it overturneth your reasō that those who were neerest to the Apostles should do best, by taking it fresh frō thē, & so frō hand to hand. For some of the later did not only equall, but farre exceed those who were their fore-runners, as Chrysostome in the Greeke Church may shewe. Yet vnderstand all this, that we haue no matter of moment in any point of religion, nor scant any interpretation of Scripture, but wee vndertake to advouch it, from some or more of the Fathers, in one place or other of their writings, where they hādle those things. It is Popery which lately crept in, that hath with the Glosses therof, declined both the sēce of the holy Ghost, & of the old Fathers; while the pleasures of Popes & the quiddities of the barbarous schoolmē have perverted almost the whole face of Divinity, & brought it to curious speculatiōs, & vnprofitable questiōs. Whē you put it to trial, you shal see that we are not so destitute of the Fathers,

for the proofe of our religion, & the exposition of texts, nor so altogither vnstudied, and illiterate as you in your weake vnderstanding imagine vs. Touching the imputation of profanenesse, you shall heare of me heereafter.

                  BUT indeede it is no marveile though the Protestants do contēne yea revile the Fathers, in saying they taught thinges most like to dreames, they were doating olde men: they had foule blemishes and tolde trifling tales: they had weedes and dregges, blaspemies and monsters: they were childish, dull and destitute of God, and babbled they knew not what: they were bewitched of the Devil, as damned as the Devill, blasphemers, naughtie, wicked.

               5 HEere you bring a prety beade-roll of such fragmēts, as you have scraped to gither out of some of our side, who as you thinke haue perstringed diverse of the Fathers, or at least by your perverting or distorting of their wordes, you would haue the world to thinke that they haue shrewdly galled thē. Wherin you are much to be cōmēded, that to make the better shew both in your text & margēt, you bring vs the same things & quotatiōs againe, out of Causaeus & Luther, which in this very Chap. & but one leafe before you delivered vnto us. This is no rare matter in your writers; for your In Matth. 16: 18: Rhemists play a pretier part then that, when meaning to spare for no cost, to prooue Peter to be such a rocke, ason whō the Church is principall built, they thwacke authority vppon authority to as good purpose as they can. And therfore they haue in the margēt, S. Austen Serm. 26. de Sanctis, and in the text, S. Ambrose, Serm. 68. which are both but one Sermō, put in the workes of both those Fathers, but in truth belonging to neither of thē. Which must needs shew that Papists in their greatest matters doe either proceede idly, or else of purpose they do bodge with their folowers, citīg one for two, as if a man should saye that in Pompeyes time Luc: lib: 3
                        •…
                      Plut. in Cesar. Iulius broke vp

the treasury at Rome, and tooke out much mony, and one Caesar about the same time broke open the same treasury, & therevpon should conclude, that therfore the Treasury was twise forcibly entred into, when lulius Caesar was al but one man. What Luther spake, was not against a Father but a counterfeit, not against Dionysius Areopagita, but against some meane fellowe shrowding himselfe vnder his name. In K. Henry the 7. time, a man might wel haue taunted Holinshed in Henri. 7. Perkin Warbeck, & yet not haue offended against the roial bloud in the children of K. Edwarde the 4. And the same is to be said for Causaeus, who is to be imagined not to say ought against true Dionysius, but against that doater who vsurpeth that name. Now howe shameful a matter is it for you to bring in these as railing against the Doctors, whē by distinguishing this false one frō those who be right, they do coū
                  tenāce the true as much as they discoūtenāce the fained. He who saith that false mony is but brasse or copper, doth not speak evil of the kings lawful & wartantable coine. Your first fault against the Magdeburgenses, is taken out of the second Cap. 10. Century, where being ex instituto, to giue their censure on the writers of that age, they yeeld vnto thē al their due cōmendation, of zeale in Gods cause, of diligēce in preaching & writing, of fortitude in oppugning heresies, of enduring martyrdome. They shew also to what points of religiō they do speake, & taking on thē to shew what is amisse in divers of thē, they vse these words, As that the Epistles of Ignatius haue in thē 
                  some things which do seeme to incline to deformed blemishes. You might haue marked that before that speech they haue doubted of the credit & authority of some of those Epistles, whither they properly belong to Ignatius or no. So in Papias they say there was naevus, a blemish, also that Clemens Alexandrinus, & Athenagoras had their blemishes. And so of Iustinus Martyr. What word can be more gently spoken then to say they had their blemishes, the truth being so, & in such sort as no Papist can excuse it. For that I may say nothing of divers things foūd in thē, which with you cā be no lesse thē disputable; but with vs are reputed no sound doctrine; neither of some other plaine errours, it is apparant that divers of thē, as Papias, & Iustinus Martyr, did hold the Millinary heresie, & for the same are taxed by the Century

writers. That which you mētiō of trofling tales, if you apply it to thē, is worthy to be laughed at: for they haue no word of anie such matter in all that Chapter, vnlesse you take it out of their narration concerning Phocas, of whō they say, that they passe oversome things reported by Lib: 10: Vincentius inspeculo, because they seeme to be fables. And what doth this detract frō the Fathers, among whō I trust, you put not Vincentius: & Phocas did vvrite nothing for ought that wee finde. And it is not impossible that such a Legendary felow as Vincentius is, may tel a tale of S. Hierom, S. Ambros, or S. Austē, & yet the reputatiō of these Doctors be among learned men never the worse. Of Ireneus the Magdeburgenses say most mildly that he hath certaine inconvenient opinions as stubble, & they cite this for one, which I beleeue no sober Papist will hastily mainetaine, that Christ was baptized at thirty yeares of age, preached at fortye, and vvas crucified at fiftye. And that hee helde the errour of the Chiliasts or Millenaries.
               6 The secōd place which you cite out of the Cent: 2: 5: Centuries deserveth a whoop for there is not one word against any Father, but to cōmend thē, for writing against the Valētinians, Gnostiks, Matcionites, Montanists & such like other heretikes. And to the opiniōs of these heretical sects they giue ye titles of mōsters, portēts, doatings, & such other, as they wel merited. NOW if you of your goodnes wil take these heretiks for Fathers, the Centuriatours speake indeede hardly of such Fathers, for the which, wise men will not blame thē: but if you apply their cēsure cōcerning heretiks to be a railing on the Fathers whō they rather extol, this is such egregi ous ignotance or blindnes or malice, as can scant be cōceived by me, & can never be excused by you. Like to this is your quoting of Calvins Institutions, where you name not the booke, which intendeth that you never sawe him nor reade him. In his foure books there is not any thirteenth Chapter, which hath Paragraphes or Numbers 29. but only the first booke. And there is nothing touching this matter, this excepted, Cal. Instit: Lib: 1: c. 13: numer: 29: 
                  That nothing is more vnsaverye then those fonde trifles, vvhich are put out vnder the name of Ignatius. Hee yeeldeth his reason for his wordes. And this is not to revile Ignatius, but to reiecte leaden and copper

stuffe, which would gladly be shrowded vnder his winge. And if this be to revile the Fathers, almost all both Protestants and Papists, who haue taken any paines to revise and publish the Doctours, or to make any Annotations on their writings, doe revile them, for they shewe that many things are crept in among their true workes, which are not worthy to goe vnder their names. As for Causaeus, I cannot yet by any search get sight of the booke, but wee may iudge by that formerly obiected against him concerning Dionysius, that if we had the booke, your cavil did containe no great matter in truth. And by Calvine and the Century writers before named, we plentifully finde, that you make no cō
                  science to abuse and mis-report any mans words, so that thereby you may make some shew with your credulous followers. But if it were so that Causaeus a private man, and of no great reckoning for ought that I have heard, had saide some-thing which coulde not be iustified, the single cōceit of this one mā is not to be held for the iudgement of al the reformed Churches. That which you alleage from Master

                   Beza is a manifest depravation of yours; Beza in Act. cap. 23 for you make that to bee directly and absolutely spoken which is vttered conditionally. If that should bee true in Hierome saieth he, which Erasmus vpon this place hath set downe, he shoulde not only wrong Saint Paule, but should be blasphemous against Christ. He assigneth this for his reason, because hee did search for some take of imperfect piety in Christ. Now who doth doubt but to labour to finde a hole in our Saviours behaviour, and to vvitnesse of him that any part of sanctitie in him vvas vnperfect, is nothing lesse then blasphemy:

The matter then is, that the collection which Erasmus made vpon the wordes of Hierome, is too hard, and not the illation which Beza, bringeth in ther-vpon. If Erasmus mistook Hierome or strained him too farre, Beza hath nothing to say against Hierome. Thus some of your accusations are for ought that I can finde meerely forged and fained, by you; some other things are aggravated and made worse then they be; some iust censures vpon counterfeits are vrged by you as if they were invectiues

against their true works, some speeches against one apparantly erroneous doctrine is construed of you, as if it were vttered against all that the Doctors haue wrote; the taxing of one treatise or of some one sentence therein, is traduced as if it vvere the reiecting of all. Yet when all is done, he is a simple Reader that cannot see, that as your suggestions are partiall and slaunderous, so our vsage to the Fathers of the Church is such, as to giue them their full right. In token whereof it were easie to shewe in the writings of our men, many high praises and commendations given by them, to Hierom, to Chrysostome, to Augustine & the rest.

                  FOr they who cannot endure certaine set times to fast in, no marveile though they revile Saint Basile, Saint Gregory Nazianzen, S. Leo, S. Chrysostome which wrote such notable Sermons of Lent, and of other fasting dayes thē vsed, as they are now in the Catholike Church.
               
            
            
               G. ABBOT.
               7 YOV haue given vs the rule before; that we revile the Fathers: novve vvee shall haue the reason annexed to the rule. The Fathers write notable Sermons concerning Lent and other fasting daies as they are nowe vsed; and wee cannot endure such fastes, therefore we hate the Fathers writing of that argument. I vvoulde you coulde learne to hate vntruth, and then your eies would bee so opened, that you should see little of this which you write to bee true. Hovve prooue you that the Doctors speake of Lent and fasting daies as you now vse them? You name vs first Saint Basile, in whome I finde onely two Sermons concerning fasting. The Serm. de Ieiunio. former of them is in commendation of abstinence, howe good it is for the soule, howe healthfull to the body. And there is not one worde in it, to which vvee doe not assent, giving due commendation therevnto. His second Sermon doth beare a title which seemeth more to make for you, Deieiunio pridie diei Cinerum. 
                  Of the fast the day before the day of Ashes, which implyeth

that then they kept a day of ashes, as now you keepe Ashewednesday. I will not heere discusse whether the solemne vse of ashes was so auncient or no: the contrary wherof directly appeereth out of Polydore Virgil, 
                     〈◊〉
                   saying that Gregory who came two hundred yeeres after, first appointed Lent to begin on the

                        •…
                     to ashes thou shalt returne againe. Hence first the title of the Sermon may very well be supposed to be crept in by some later meanes. Secōdly if you wil allow it, then your Shrove-Tuesday must be a fasting day, which the Romanists Carnevall may not admit. Thirdly if you had looked into that Sermon it selfe, you might haue found that more then once, Basile speaketh of a fast onely for five daies, & no more; which being to be kept no lōger, vtterly overthroweth your positiō, that in those times Lent and fasting daies were observed as now they be. You haue hard happe Doctour Hill to trippe vp your owne heeles. In Gregory Nazianzen there is so little concerning fasting, as that scāt any point in Divinity is lesse touched by him then that. In all his works I find nothing purposely of that argument, but that a once he doth excuse himselfe, that for a whole Lent he had bin withdrawne De quadrage

Out of which there is nothing to be wonne but this, that a Lent in one sorte or other was kepte in his time, which you need not trouble your selfe to prove; for we do yeeld it. As for Chrysostome, he hath three or foure Sermons where he speaketh of fasting, how requisite it is, and that aboue all matters men in their abstinence should fast frō sinne, which doctrine wee also publish. Onely Ad 
                  Serm. 72: & 73. 
                  Populum Antiochenum he hath two Sermons which mention Lent kepte among them, but particularly in what māner of abstinēce, he speaketh not. And what maketh this against vs, whom you wrongfully charge to endure no sette times of abstaining? Leo hath many Sermons cōcerning fasting, whereof De ieiunio d

So that in a vvord amongest all these Fathers vvhom you bring as crossing our courses, heere is nothing which toucheth vs, but rather maketh against you.
               8. But to the ende that you and as many as vvill, may bee satisfied vvhat vvee doe in this behalfe, first vvee doe teach that fasting and abstinence not for or vvith superstition, but vvith faith and knowledge is necessarie for Christian men. 2. Sam. 12. 16. David fasting prayed for the life of the childe vvhich vvas borne in adulterie. VVhen the enemies invaded his Kingdome, 2. Chron. 20. 3 Iosaphat commaunded a publike fast to bee proclaimed. VVhat shoulde I speake of Ezr: 8. 21. Ezra vppon occasion doing the like, and

the king of Ion. 3. 7: Ninive at the preaching of Ionas, Ioel. 1: 14: cap. 2. 15. Ioel prescribeth this to bee the meanes to appease the Lord in the midst of his indignation. And in the new Testament wee heare of it as practised by Mat. 4. 2. Christ, and there are by Cap: 6. 16. him also rules prescribed in vvhat sorte it shoulde bee done. For frequenting of it, Luk: 2: 37. Anna the old vertuous widow is commended, and so is Act. 10: 30 Cornelius. It is one of the weapons wherwith S. 2. Cor: 6: 5 Paul did fight against his spiritual enemies. Briefly, in casting out of Divels Christ ioineth fasting with praiers, & saith that there is one kind of

                  Watching, fasting and such like, doe not binder but helpe, if they be done with the order of discretion. Which if they bee so done with the fault of indescretion, that either by the spirit fainting or the body growing sicke spirituall things be hindered, hee who is so, hath taken away from his body the effecting of a good worke from his spirite affection to it, from his neighbour an example, frō God honor: he is sacrilegious & gilty of all these thinges towards God. Not that according to the meaning of the Apostle, even this doth not seeme the duetie of a man, and it be not decent and iust, that the head should once ake in the service of God, which formerly hath oftētimes even to aking labored in the vanity of the world: or that the belly should be hungry even to croping, which hath often times beene filled even to vomiting, but a measure in all things is to be had: the body is sometimes tobe afflicted, but not to be worne out. I shut vp this point with that of Hierome, Epistol: 
                        〈◊〉
                     : 
                  Impose vpon thy selfe such a measure of fasting as thou art able to beare. And againe, Epistol. 10

               10 Fourthly to put a religious difference betweene meates, as that Christians some times may feed on fish and not on flesh, is Antichristian and vniustifiable superstition. Those who teach this difference are within the compasse of S. Pauls prophecy calling it a doctrine of Devils, when 1. Tim. 4. 3 
                  men forbid to mary and to abstain from meates, which God hath created to be received with thanks-giving. The Ibidem. Rhemists would shift this place by applying it to the Manichees, and some other olde heretikes, and by telling vs that the Church of Rome holdeth all meates cleane by Gods creatiō: but these are simple evasions, for doth the example of those ancient heretikes any way preiudicate, but that there may bee such again now in the world, as at this time there be Arrians, & as you embrace Pelagianisme a fresh; and is it not more likely to be vnderstood of you then of them, since they were more thē twelue hundred years agone, & the prophecie is that such should come in the latter times: and in those we now doe liue. And whereas it is confessed that you holde them not vncleane by Gods creation;

that maketh against you, since you by your constitutions dare to repute that polluted, which God hath sāctified & made cleane. Tit. 1: 15: 
                  Unto the pure all things are pure. It is your inhibitiō which presumeth to make that vnlawful, which the creatour did not so make, and this is iniurious to Gods creation. And yet I must tell you that there is one of yours who writing of this argument, doth yeeld thereason of your prohibition of fleshe and not of fishe, on fasting daies, to bee from the creatures themselves made by the Almighty, even Durandus who teacheth it to bee, because God did not at the first curse the waters, Lib. 6

But hee cursed the earth in the workes of man, and hence it is that in fasting it is not lawfull to eate ante kinde of flesh which liveth on the earth as foure-footed beastes and birdes &c. Neither can any Papist yeelde a better reason then this, why in their fastes fishe shoulde bee eaten of, and that vvith greedinesse, as they permitte leave to themselves to doe. VVhere I appeale to the consciences'not onely of all other vvho doe knowe them, but even of our Romanistes themselves, vvhether the ordinary keeping of fishe-dayes amonge such of them as be of ability, bee according to the true nature of a fast, to pull downe the flesh, or rather to inflame it.

And such abstinence as this doth Saint De moribus Manich. lib. 2: 13: Austen condemne in the Manichees, who would touch no fleshe, and yet did feede on all the dainties that arte or witte coulde affoorde. His iudgement is that the moderate eating of a peece of bacon, or some other plaine fleshe, is not so luxurious as that their abstinence. Our doctrine in this behalfe is, that Matth: 15: 11. 
                  it which goeth into the mouth defileth not a man, but that vvhich commeth out of the mouth defileth a man. And Rom: 14. 17:

                      it is good that the hearte bee stablished with grace, and not vvith meates, vvhich haue not profited them, that 
                  Hebr: 13 9 
                  haue beene occupied therein. To these thinges the auncient Fathers doe agree, as Tertullian, De cibis ludaicis: 
                  GOD taketh pleasure onely in our faith, onely in our innoceney, onely in our truth, onely in our vertues, which dwell not in the belly but in the minde, & vvhich the feare of God and awe to heavē do get vnto vs, not earthly meat. And to this agreeth S. Austen, De civit: Dei: l 16. 37: 
                  Wee learne in eating that no man is to bee blamed, for the kinde of meate; but for the immodest greedinesse. Yet withall we adde, that for civil order and the common wealthes sake, for the sparing of the provision at Land, for spēding of that which cōmeth frō the Sea, for the incouragmēt of fisher

                  mē, & for farther maintenāce & imploiment of navigation, on such daies as by positive lawes be appointed, wee make & ought to make a difference of our diet, keeping such times as fish-daies, by which name they are more properly called, thē to be termed fasting daies: This we do for civil order & obedience, & not for that which may be termed directly an immediate acte of religion; for we condemne the Romish Church for embracing that opinion. Although indeede the wiser sort of that packe do hold this to bee but a small matter of religion, and rather in their owne minds repute it a devise politickely to keepe people in awe, or a tricke if neede bee to get good store of mony when they lift to dispence, as may bee seene by that of Genebrard. l. 4: chronogr: Clement the 6 who proclaiming a Croisado against the Turkes (in truth to inrich himselfe after the fashion of the Popes) gave every one who would pay for it, a free liberty to eate egges and white meate, on the Fridaies and every fasting

day, Lent excepted. This did the Arch-bishops of Triers and Colein obtaine for their Dioceses for ever; but the Arch-bishop of Mentz refusing to contribute so much mony as was required, itlyeth on his Diocese to this day, that they may not eate egges or other white meates on the fasting daies, as in the other tvvo Bishops lurisdictions it is permitted. How much happier did the coine make the one of these, then the other? But when his Holinesse list, he can goe farther then this, as Pope Leo the 10. did, when Ioh: Fox. in Eccles: Histor: Cromwel went to renue the Pardons of Boston. For there among many other favours one was, that it shold be lawful for the brethren of the Fraternity at Boston, to eate milke, egges, butter on forbidden daies, yea in Lent it selfe; yea fleshe also by the advise of a ghostly father and a Physitian, and all this without scruple of conscience. So that if the gentle Pope list, (vvho wil knowe vpon what tearmes he parteth with his dispensation) the thing is no sin; which some of the wiser Pseudo-Catholikes have smelled out as we may imagine, when so freely in Rome it selfe & in Paris, some of that Balaamitical cōgregation make no cōsciēce so that it be secretly done, to feed some or the greatest part of Lent on flesh, as diverse of our traveilers do constantly report. And we haue no smal store of these in England too, which in their harte loue his Holinesse well, but yet will not part vvith their fleshe on fishe daies for his sake. Some bee vviser then some.
               11 Fifthly we doe not finde that any set daies of fasting vvere appointed by Christ or his Apostles, and the Popish daies differ somewhat at this time from those of the Primitive Church, so that they haue neither warrant from GODS vvorde, nor yet from the auncient. Diverse of those whome they call their Ladies Eves, were not so much as heard of long agone. Fridaie and Saterday are nowe the ordinary daies of abstinence, and VVednesday is almost quite discontinewed saving in some few places, and on some fewe set times. Some of the olde Church hearde of Friday, and VVednesday

Epiphanius hath as much, who is he in all the world, which assenteth not that on the fourth day, and the day before the Sabaoth (he meaneth the Iewes Sabaoth vvhich was Saterday) a fast is decreed in the Church? And if we must also bring forth the Constitution of the Apostles, how they did there decree, that on the fourth day & that before the Sabaoth, there should bee fasting everis where, the Pētecost excepted &c. And in another In conclusion. liber cōtt. heres. place hee hath, That the fasts were so delivered by the Apostles of Christ. Thus some of the most auncient kepte them in a forme differing from that of these moderne times. VVhere also you may observe that it was the fashion of those times, to attribute to the Apostles all thinges for which themselues were earnest, if they had beene so derived to them from their predecessours, that they vvell knevve not the first erecter or inventer of them, vvhich before the ende of this Chapter vvill bee more manifested. But for this present, Saint Augustine vvho lived after Epiphanius, and for his iudicious labours vvas inferiour to none of the vvorthiest Fathers of the Church, vppon good advise speaketh thus, Epist: 8
                        •…
                     
                   
                  If you aske my opinion in this matter, I revolving it in my minde doe see that in the vvritinges of the Evangelistes and Apostles, and in all, that vvhich is called the Nevve Testamente fasting is commaunded. But vppon vvhaat dayes vvee ought not to fast, and on vvhat dates vve should, I doe not see it defined by the precept of the Lord or his Apostles. If Saint Augustine had ever heard of any authenticall Constitution from the Apostles, heere had beene a good time to have mentioned it. And so it had beene for Saint Chrysostome, when hee teacheth his hearers, that God had lefte virginity & fasting not as matters imposed on men by necessity, but arbitrary and at their owne choice. His wordes are these, In 1

                     vve, but hath leste them in the free-vvill and choice of the auditours. These Fathers then could not finde that any sette dayes of fasting vvere imposed by GOD, by the Apostles, or any other of sufficient povver, else they vvoulde not haue spoken as

they did. And among the Canōs fathered on the Apostles as In concilijs. Isidore citeth them, there is no such matter to be foūd, which maketh vs bold vpō the warrant of all these, to thinke the speech of Epiphanius to be too large: and that so much the rather, because Vt supra. Origene who went long before him mentioneth the daies, but hath not one worde, that they were so ordered by the Apostles. These are therfore cōstitutiōs but of men, & they who came after thē especially in the Westerne Church, have varied frō them, as appeereth by rather accepting of Saterday then Wednesday, or by adding some where this last to the other, which sheweth that they thēselues imagined the ordināce not to be Apostolical. We then finding thē so at first erected & then varied by mē, do holde thē but to be humane cōstitutiōs, & for order & comelines sake we retaine them, as having received them from our Auncesters, concerning whom we are of that iudgment wherof every milde & sober man should be, that is to say, for the reverence which he beareth his predecessours, to professe that he willingly receiveth frō them, al things, which he doth not find either directly or by a consequent contrary to the word of God. This rule directeth vs in these set daies for fishe, & we keepe them, but yet teaching our people in what sorte, for order & decency not for religion & superstition. For we dare not goe so farre as Papistes doe, but wee rather abominate their doctrine, when they make the keeping of fasting daies one of the Horae beatisi virginis. Vaux in Catechis: commaundements of their Church, and annexe vnto them that the 
                  Vaux Ibi. 
                  charitable keeping of these commaundementes bringeth everlasting life: but the contemning of these preceptes and such like of holy Church, bringeth everlasting damnation, & do so hardly pursue those who haue eaten forbidden meates on their fishe daies, as that nothing but life will make satisfaction for the same. According wherevnto a Centur: 16: in An. 1538. yong gentleman of Tholose was served in Fraunce, beeing burnt to ashes at Paris for eating fleshe, vvhen it was not permitted by the Romane Synagogue. The like examples I might produce of men so served in Scotland for the same cause, and England hath had some mightily molested there-about.
               12 I might adde some other circumstances appertaining to fasting, as that there ought to bee no opinion of merite in it,

since our best vvorkes are in themselves defective, and our very Isai: 64. 6. righteousnesse is but like to a menstruous cloath: but our request must bee that GOD vvill accepte the vvorke for his CHRISTES sake. Also that it bee not in hypocrisy, as theirs was whome CHRIST Mat: 6: 161 reprooved for making a shevv before men; or as that of the Pharisee vvas, vvho toulde the Luc: 18. 12. Lorde that hee fasted twise in the vveeke. Of such abstinence as this is, Saint Cyprian doth speake, De ieiunio christl. 
                  Fasting doth oftentimes puffe vp a man, and doth driue him to pride and hypocrisie. Lastly there must bee as greate a care to abstaine from sinne as from meate. The Prophet Cap 58: 6: Esay doth most significantly expresse this, Is not this the fasting vvhich I haue chosen, to loose the bandes of vvickednesse, to take of the heavie burthens, and to let the oppressed goe free, and that yee breake everie yoake? And the Fathers of the Church doe frequently ingeminate it, as Origene, Homil.

                     :

For as a man consisteth of a bodie and a soule, so there are tvvo-folde meates &c. Saint Ambrose speaketh yet more plainely, Serm: 33: 
                  This is the vvill of the LORDE, that vvee shoulde fast from meates and also from sinnes. That vve shoulde enioyne our bodie abstinence, that vvee may the more vvith dravve our soules from vices: for a bodie vvhich is dravvne drie is a bridle to a luxurious soule. I vvill shutte this vp vvith the speech of Gregorie, Homil. 16: in 40: Homilijs: 
                  To sanctifie a fast, is (ioyning other good thinges) to shevve an abstinence of the fleshe vvorthie of GOD. Let anger cease, let chiding bee allayed. For the fleshe is pulled downe in vaine, if the minde be not refrained from her evill pleasures. Thus you see what our Church holdeth concerning fasting: we allow, and commend it, and teach it as well as you; but wee iumpe not with you in your Iewishe superstitions: we attribute no sāctity to the differēce of meats, neither in religiō do we hold our selves tied to daies of true fasting, although by civil lawes which are to bee obeyed for conscience sake, we are tied to fish daies. God accepteth not the one foode before the other. True fasting is to receive no sustenāce or very

little, as may be seene by the Ionas 3: 7: Ninivits who did eate no food & drinke no water, & so will good Christians deale by themselues whē others do not know it, & on such daies as in their own hart they appropriate to that vse: for we haue a liberty so to do as Origen telleth vs, A 
                  Homil: 10 in Levitic. 
                  Christian hath liberty to fast at any time, not with superstition of observation, but with the vertue of containing. And thus farre haue I followed you concerning fasting daies. Now some thing also touching Lent.
               13 Your proposition is that Lent and fasting daies were kept in the time of the old Fathers as you keepe them now. I haue in part shewed the vanity of that assertiō for the one already. Now let vs see for the other. When the first keeping of a Lent began it is hard to say. S. Hierome ascribeth the or daining therof to the Apostles. For Episto. 54: he shewing the difference betweene the Orthodoxe and the Montanistes, amonge other matters saith that the Montanists yearely kept three Lents, but we doe fast one Lent in the whole yeare according to the tradition of the. Apostles. And this place doth De inventorib. Rer. lib. 6. 3. Polydore Virgil cite out of Hierome, as referring the institution of Lent to the Apostles of Christ. But we are of opinion that in this matter Hierome is favourably to be vnderstoode, at calling that which was auncient, and the set beginning wherof vvas not distinctly knowne, by the name of an Apostolicall tradition: but no way being able to prooue, that by them it was ordained. The reasons of this our assertion are, first that vvee thinke it cannot bee found in any of the writers of the first three hundred yeares, vvho lived neerest to the dayes of the Apostles, that they decreed it. Origene speaketh of Lent, but goeth not so farre. Wee haue the daies of Lent consecrated vnto fastings. Secondlye if the Apostles had ordained it, they woulde haue set Homil. 10 in, Levitic. downe some order and manner of it, in one vniformity to all the Church; but of that wee finde no steppe or marke amonge those of the Primitiue times, but exceeding greate disagreement many vvaies, as forth-vvith I shall declare. Thirdly vve finde some-what expresly to the contrary, and that not where this matter is touched obiter and slightlye as by Hierome, but vvhere the vvhole state of Lent is of purpose rifled and discussed, as shall presently be touched. Eusebius Eccl hist: lib: 5. 24: speaking of the 

heate of Victor the Romane Bishoppe in excommunicating the Easterne Churches, for not iumping vvith the VVesterne in the circumstaunces of observing Easter, signifieth vvithal that the Bishoppes of the VVest did much dislike the attempte of Victor. Amongst other Ireneus vvho lived in Fraunce, writeth to Victor aboute it, vvhose vvordes Eusebius citeth thus: This controversio is not onelye of the date of Easter, but also of the order and manner of the Fast. For some doe thinke that they oughte to fast one daie, others two, diverse more, ma

                     te fortie, and they doe measure and make vp the daie, reckoning all the houres of the dait and night. And such varietye and difference of those vvho observed these fastes did not beginn
                        •…
                      in our age, but longe before amonge our anncesters, vvho (as a man may gesse) did not strictly obserue the custome of them, vvho tither by a certaine simplicitis or by a private authoritye had determined some thing against future time. Thus the case of Lent stoode most vncertainelye, aboute two hundred yeares or lesse after Christes birth, and Ireneus saieth that this difference had beene also amonge their predecessours much before, so that hitherto wee may vvell collecte, that in the first Church there vvas no determinate vniforme certainety in the keeping of Lent; which doubtlesse had not beene vvanting, if the Apostles had been the erecters or founders thereof. 
                     〈◊〉
                   Socrates hath a longe tract, Eccl. Hist. lib: 5: 21: first concerning the keeping of Easter, which he plainely saith grewe to be diversly observed among men, by custome and not by any lavve from the Apostles, although, saith he, they of Asia say that they haue their tradition from Saint Iohn the Evangelist, and they of Rome saye they haue theirs from Saint Peter. But hee reiecteth both their sayinges, because they coulde bring no written testimonie of either of these, vvhich is a good course for vs also to examine traditions called Apostolicall by. From Easter he commeth to Lent, and therein sheweth, that even in his daies which was late, the manner of keeping of it was very different. Those saith hee who are at Rome doe fast three vveekes togither before Easter, the Saterdaie and the Sundaie beeing excepted. But they vvho dvvell in Illyria and all Greece; and they vvho dvvell at. Alexandria doe sixe vveekes before beginne those fastes vvhich are kepte before Easter, and that time they call Lente.
                  
                  Some contrary to the custome of these, making seven weekes before that feast the beginning of their fasting, although they doe fast onely fifteene daies, and that with some distaunce being put betweene, yet notwithstanding they call this Quadragesima or Lent. Wherevpon I doe not a little wonder how these though they differ in the number of the daies, yet all cal it by one name Quadragesima. Diverse doe giue diverse reasons of this name, devised of their owne heade. Moreover they doe not only differ in the number of the daies, but in their abstinence from meate they folow diverse courses. For some doe altogither abstaine from all kind of living creatures: some amonge living creatures doe eate only fishes, some togither with fish doe eate also birdes, and doe saie that they are bredde of the water, (as it is in Moises.) Some doe forbeare from fruits covered with hard shels, and from egges: others doe eate dry breade only, others not so much as that. There bee who when they haue fasted to the ninth houre doe vse various kindes of meates. In severall nations they fast severally, whereof there are almost infinite causes. And because no man can shewe any precepts concerning it set downe in writing, it is manifest that the Apostles therein did giue free power to everie man, minde and will, that each man should doe that which is good, beeing induced vnto it neither by feare nor necessitie. This severall sort of fasting we doe know to be in the Churches.
               
               14 Hence then iudge whither it came from the Apostles or no, and conferre these thinges with the place of Saint Augustine before mencioned, where hee speaketh in generall of fasting daies. And here Doctour Hill appeareth your great skil in antiquity, when cōtrary to so direct records, you avouch that your Lent and fasting daies are now kept as they were in the daies of the olde Fathers, which is as false as any thing possibly can bee, yea taking it of the very Church of Rome it selfe, which so late as Socrates lived, (that is at least till Theodosius the younger) kept it but three weekes, and that with some daies interrupted. And least that you should thinke that onely Socrates reporteth this, heare Sozom. l. 7 19. Sozomen in the same argument, who intreating of the severall customes of diverse Churches in many circumstaunces, saith thus of Lent, That Lent wherein the people fasteth, some doe reckon for sixe weekes of daies, as the Illyrians and those who are towarde the West, as also all Lybia and Egypt with them of Palestina: some for seven
                  
                  as they of Constantinople, and the nations lying about even to the Phaenicians; some seatteringly or interruptedly do fast three weekes in these sixe or seven: other doe continuately keepe the three weekes vvhich immediately goe before Easter: some two weekes, as the followers of Monta
                        •…
                     . Such varietye of opinions vvas there in the Primitiue Church. It is now the resolution of our Romanists that Lent is no Lent vnlesse it bee for forty daies, since it is an imitation of Christ vvho fasted Mat: 4: 2: fortye daies and forty nights. But besides that there are other reasons assigned, why it should be for that space. Aq

Or because in this mortall body we consist of the foure elementes, by the pleasures of which bodie vve goe against the commaundements of the Lord, which are received by the ten commaundements. Wherevpon it is fit that we should afflict that flesh fortie times. Or because so we striue to offer to God the tith of our daies. For since the yeare is continued for 365. daies, and we are afflicted for thirty six daies, which are to be fasted in the sixe weekes of the Lent, wee doe as it vvere yeelde to God the 
                        •…
                     the or tenth of our yeare. Here a man may knovve some reasons more then he knew before, why Lent consisteth of forty daies. But what adoe there was to hammer it to this set number, it is marveilous to beholde. There are certaine decrees which are put out in the names of some of the most auncient Bishops of Rome. Among these, Decretal. Epist Teles phori. Anastas. in vita Telesp. Telesphorus is made to write thus, We doe decree that seven full weekes before the holy Easter, all Cleargie men, that is such as are called into the lot of the Lorde shall fast from flesh, because as the life of Cleargie men shoulde bee different from the conversation of lay men, so also in their fasting there should bee a difference. Here then the Cleargy did fast fifty daies rather then forty, keeping no Shrouetide, but beginning Lent at Quinquagesima, and fasting the Sundaies as well as the rest. For so Polydore Lib. 6. 3. Virgill collecteth vpon the place, for fiftie daies they were to fast every daie, not one beeing omitted. And the words of the Decree doe cary so much, seven full weekes. But see what an inconvenience did arise herevpon. A supposed Constitution of the Apostles vvas broken by this. For some holde that on the

Lordes daye or Sundaye no Christian might fast. VVhere once againe wee finde that matters vvhich may most iustly bee doubted of, are called Constitutions or traditions Apostolical. For hovve came it about that the most auncient Fathers and the vvriter of the Epistle fathered on Telesphorus knevve not that there vvas such an ordinaunce? VVell, Haeres. 70: Epiphanius speaking of fasting and mourning, saith it is an ordinance of the Apostles, Hee vvho afflicteth his soule on the LORDES daye, is accursed to GOD And in In Conclus libri contra haereses. another place speaking as plainly, hee saith that there were no fastes vppon the LORDS dayes, and that therefore the Communion vvas celebrated in the morning, that aftervvardes they might eate that daye. Howe may that of Telesphorus and this supposed Apostolicall custome or Constitution stande togither? And yet Part: 1: Decret. Distinct. 4. 5. Gratian as late as hee vvrote, vvhich is about foure hundred yeeres since vvas contented to cite that Decree of Telesphorus, as if it might haue his vse in our daies, either to know it or to keepe it.
               15 Nowe did those vvho came after, like of this supposed ordinaunce of that Romane Arch-bishoppe? No such matter: For concerning the length of time the Councell of Orleans did take order by an expresse Canon, Concil. Aurelian: Canon: 20: 
                  This is decreed for all Priests, that before the solemnity of Easter, not Quinquagesima, but Quadragesima shall bee helde. Thus the time of the Clergyes Lent was abridged. That the time of fiftye daies was in vse before it may appeere by Saint Serm de Eb

                     tate. Basile mentioning that the fast of Lent vvas for seven vveekes. VVhere by the vvay this may bee noted that these vvoordes crosse that other speech cited by me before touching the fast onely of five daies, and therefore one of the two Sermons may goe for a counterfeite. Touching fasting on the Sundaye, another Pope not long after is brought in to correct that. And this is Decret: Me
                        •…
                     chad Melchiades, who in his Decretal Epistle is thus sette downe to write, The fast then of the Lordes daye and of Thursdaye no man must celebrate, that there may bee a true and vnfained difference, betvveene the fast of the Christians and the Gentiles: of these vvho doe beleeve truely, and of Infidels and Heretikes. Thus the Sundaye is leapte out of Lent: But heere is another trouble vvithall: for by this Decree it hath taken away

the Thursday also, and so the dayes of Lente are shrewdely shrunke. In this distraction was the olde Church about this fast, no man almost being able distinctly to tell vvhat to make of it for the number of the dayes. They vvho harkened to Telesphorus had a Quinquagesima for a Quadragesima, fiftye or at least forty and nine dayes for fortye. They vvho beganne at Quadragesima Sunday and kepte all till Easter, had fortye and two daies to their Lente, and so as Vbi supra. Polidore hath, for a good while it was kepte. They vvho began at Quadragesima, and slipte out the Sundayes had but thirty and sixe daies to vvhich Aquinas alludeth as before is signified: And if after Melchiades they vvoulde cull out Thursdaies too, the fortye vvoulde bee but thirtye. Heere then at last to mende all, and to strike the finall stroke, commeth Gregory the Greate about sixe hundred yeeres after CHRIST, and because hee vvill have forty daies, and yet the Sundayes too put out of question to bee no fasting daies, hee added Poli. Virg: vt supra: foure daies more to Lent, that is to saye those which are before the Sunday tearmed Quadragesima, beginning Lent on that VVednesday vvhich for the solemnity of ashes thē appointed by him to be vsed, is called Ashe-vvednesdey, from vvhich time vntill Easter-day, if the Sundaies bee quite exempted from the number, there may bee reckoned fortye dayes. And that in Gregories time the Sundayes were so shut out, appeereth partely by that of himselfe testifying that Homil. 16: in 40: Homil: 
                  they did not celebrate fast on the LORDS daye in the Lente. So that vvee may saye of this Lent, as it vvas saide of Rome.

               And yet there bee in England persons Popishly affected, vvho if they bee questioned vvithall, are not quite resolved in the pointe, whether the first foure daies after Shrovetide bee properly of Lent or no: vvhether that bee but a preparing and clensing vveeke, and vvhether good-Fridaye as it is called, and Easter Even bee to bee solemnized as a parte of a Lenten fast, or for some other reason, and so consequentlye vvhether the Sundaies bee not to bee fasted as naturall members and a true portion of the forty daies or no, and if they bee not to bee so

fasted, then by what rule a man may not eate flesh vpon them? Thus is Popery tyed togither with points. When therefore you right learned M. Doctour doe so clerke-like tell vs that in the daies of Saint Basile, Saint Gregory Nazianzene, Saint Leo, S. Chrysostome, Lent and other fasting daies were vsed as they are nowe in the Catholike Church, are you not ashamed of your selfe, and do you not condemne either your owne ignorance for writing you knowe not what, or audaciousnesse for assevering so earnestly that which is so grossely false? But you doe well to vphold Popery by that meanes; the doctrine of Antichrist and Sathan by all kinde of lyes. If you cannot blush for your selfe, yet all modest Papists may blush for you, to find in what sort such companions as you are, make no conscience to say ought in that, which they hold to be their religion. I haue taken a little paines to instruct you concerning the first, ancient and most different observation of Lent: and I let you farther know, that for vniformity with other Christian Churches, and conformity to that vvhich we receiued from those who so long agone went before vs, wee keepe Lent, not superstitiously as you and yours doe, but according to the laws of our most Christian Magistrats, who cōmande an abstinence from flesh, not for any sanctity which is in such forbearing, but for other wise and civill reasons. And as herein our law alloweth a toleration to such as by necessity of sicknesse or otherwise are enforced to feed on flesh, so it convinceth all such as wilfully or carelessely doe transgresse without any other reason saving their owne greedy appetite. So that wee accounte such men offendours before God, albeit not simply and immediately for the eating of Gods creatures, yet consequentlye for dis-obeying the Edicts of godly Princes, to whom they are to yeeld obsequiousnes, and that for Rom: 13: 5 conscience sake. In this therfore you very discreetly accuse vs of you cannot tell what, as you doe in that also which now followeth.

               16 HEre now followeth a rable of wicked slaunders, to which you are so inured, that you bee not your selfe, vnlesse almost in every leafe you plentifully powre them out. You charge vs here with many sinnes: and truth it is that in our Realme there are too many, as there will ever bee in the militant Church. But yet it is easie to bee iustified, that the Gospell hath so farre imprinted the feare of God in some, & the good laws established the feare of man in other, that no Popish Realme nor Countrey may for moral civill behaviour bee compared to England. Those brutish & beastly sensuall sins which are commonly winked at in Italy and in your Popes courte, are scant knowne among vs, and here lesser sortes of luxury & wantonnesse lie subiect to both Ecclesiastical and temporall punishment. The filthy lubricity of many Papistes is growne to a Proverbe long since amongst vs, and yet they would perswade men that they liue vnder the crosse & in persecution. Yea what may be supposed is done at liberty, (whereof I leaue the testification to a marginall note of M. Quodli. 2 Articul: 2: Watsons in his Quodlibets) vvhen your Priestes and Prisoners restrained at Wisbich are publikely in print questioned one by another, as about other disorders, so namely for Manifest. ca. 1. whoredome. But of this more largely hereafter. For gluttony who ever exceeded your Pseudo-Catholikes on their fish daies, and double feasts, or your monkes the belly-gods of the world, the knights of Bacchus and Ceres, the sty-fed swine of Europe? This by-word was not for naught,

                     O monachi, vestri stomachi sunt amphora Bacchi,
                     Vos estis, Deus est testis, turpissima pestis,
                  
As for ambition, all the earth cannot put downe the Cardinals of Rome, and the inferiour Prelates vnder them. VVhat tumultes were there wont to be about every Bishopricke or rich Abbay, two or three striving for it, and running or sending to Rome, to

see whither could out-bribe other. No man is more plentiful in this argument then In Hen: 3: Mathew Paris. What endlesse ambition is there and hath there beene in aspiring to the Papacy, Kings & Princes being set one against another for Popes causes, and in the time of Antipapes a great part of Christendome beeing vp in armes, some on the one side, & some on another. It is not forgotten howe in Englande the Arch-bishops of Canterbury and Yorke haue striven for priority, their crosses which rather should haue taught them humility iutting each with other, and the bearers of them being ready to iustle each other from the wal, in the presence of the Cleargy and Nobilitie of the Realme. Nay if there were nothing else to shevve the ambition of the Romanists, yet let vs not novve bee blinde at home, where in Quodl. 2: 7 printed bookes, there hath beene question made betweene the Iesuites and secular Priestes concerning precedence in going, and betweene Priestes and other of their religion for places at table, so vnfitly and immodestly, as woulde rather beseeme vaine and weake-witted women, then men who professe themselues to bee of learning and gravitye, besides the greatest tye of their Ecclesiasticall function. But every Papist doth well to imitate the Pope his holy Father, who setteth himselfe aboue all Kings and Emperours, and therefore they may doe sutably to goe before as many as they can, not in Rom. 12: 10 giving but in taking honor. Yet Christ the best Master hath taught another lesson, Mat: 11: 29 
                  Take my yoke on you, and learne of me, that I am humble and meeke. Lastly for covetousnesse, who ever on earth exceeded the Romish Synagoge, vvho by the manours and large possessions given them had almost devoured whole Europe; and by their Buls sent abroad, as also by their dispensations at home did shew themselues the most cunning Alchimistes in the worlde to turne in many places a little leade into a great deale of golde, which was fitly Premier Recucil fol 767. likened to the chaunge of Diomedes and Glaucus in Homere. Adde to this the infinite riches vvhich they had by continuall Legacies, Vowes, Offrings and Giftes, whereof monuments may yet bee seene in Rome, Paris, Colein and other places, in their crosses, Images, shrines, and many other things of pure massie gold vvith plenty of precious stones; and as once might haue appeared in

the treasures belonging to Thomas Becket at Cāterbury, which as Peregrin: Relig. ergo Erasmus who saw them describeth them, did far surpasse the riches of many a king. To contract this matter, the story is vvell known how King Io Fox. in Richard. 1. Richard the first bestowed the three daughters in mariage whom one Fulco put him in minde of, I meane those dangerous daughters Pride, Covetousnesse and Luxurie. He placed Pride with the Templars, Avarice with the Cistertian Monkes, and Luxurye with the pompous Prelates of the Church. Such good opinion vvas in those dayes to bee carryed concerning the mortified persons of the Romishe Cleargye.
               17 In this place I finde that you exceede your selfe, if possibly that might be. You set vp here to your selfe a ladder of vntruths, whereon you may by every rounde or steppe come higher and higher to the father of lyes. VVe are given to lust, gluttony, ambition, covetousnesse; that is your lowest step. Then, we teach doctrine which must necessaryly bring soorth such fruites. After this, wee contemne Saint Basile, Saint Chrysostome, Saint Hierome, Saint Augustine. Then to the ende that you maye beare the garlande from all your fellowes, generallye the doctrine of the aunient Fathers, is cleane contrarie to the doctrine of Protestantes.

                     ore Hanniball saw many doting olde men, but never such a one as Phormio. But I turne backe vnto you. Staphyl. in Apolog. You haue long muttered that we teach a doctrin of liberty, and we set open the gate to all profanenes. Notwithstanding this is a slander of your own invētion, neither are you able to name one learned and approved Protestāt, who ever in his preaching or writīg could iustly be charged with any such matter. Only your spleene is against that point of faith in Christ, which while you labor to oppugne, you do wrong to vs, but more to God, & to his Son our Saviour, the power of whose redēption you extenuat at your pleasure, to set vp your own merites. Whereas wee doe teach that the same faith when occasion is offred, doth Galat: 5. 6 work by loue, is seene in his fruits, & can no more be without a Christian cōversatiō, thē fire without heat, or water without moisture. This we hold: whereas cōtrarywise I appeale to the cōscience of your selfe, as also to the cōscience of every indifferently minded man, whither Popery be

not the open gap to a gulfe of al vngodlines, when the absolution of a Preest shal be said to free a man frō hel; the Indulgēce of a Pope, the same person frō Purgatory; the pardon of such a one as cannot forgiue his own sinnes (for the Rhemens. Thess. 2: 4: Pope himselfe confesseth to another Priest and is absolved by him) shall cleere a man from poysoning, murthering, whoring & all vncleannes; whē satisfactiōs to God-ward may be wrought & made for mēs trāsgressions. The infectiō of this & the like leprosies maketh Papists audacious to do any thing, & then let thē goe barefoote about the Ascensiō weeke, or whip thēselves on good-Friday, let thē go to Rome at a lubiley, or on Pilgrimage at other times, but especially let thē come to cōfessiō & have absolutiō, & they are as cleane from the gilt, as if they had never cōmitted any such facts. This confidence maketh the life of many of your false named Catholikes to be a cōtagious sinke of execrable lewdenes, no pen being able to paint out their filthines, which as elswhere it may be exemplified, so principally in Rome that singular cage of foule and vncleane birdes. I was once in Oxford present with two prisoners cōvicted of a murther, the one was named Parrhy, a kinsman of the great traitour Doctour Parrhy; the other was called Richardson. When this Parrhy after many villanies in England and beyond the seas, had finally as a robber murthered vpon the way a drover carying with him good store of mony, & it much grieved his fellow Richardson thē being in cōpany, that Parrhy had slaine the mā, & Richardsons cōscience, as himselfe reported to me & other, could in no sorte be appeased about the fright & remorse therof, Parrhy bad him not dismay himselfe, but prepare as soone as he could to fly after him into Ireland (for thither indeede the principal murtherer was hastening) and from thence they would to Rome, where he had been with his vncle Doctor Parrhy before, and knewe the fashions of the place, & there hee vndertooke to get a pardon of his Holinesse, and all should be as wel as if it had never beene. This Parrhy tould mee that he had beene a Page to a Cardinal in Rome, an attendant on the Duke of Guize slaine by the commaundement of Henry the third of Fraunce, and of garde to the Duke of Parma, and therefore may bee well supposed to have knowne Popishe fashions. And

of certainty he lived a
                     •…
                   Romanist and so professed himselfe at the time of his execution. I could adde more examples of this nature shevving that Papistes vvant no incouragementes to sinne.
               18 On the contrary part we simply and absolutely dehorte our people from all crimes, laying the iudgments of God before such as transgresse in the same. VVe lay vnto them the texte of the Apostle that the 
                  Gal. 5: 19: 
                  vvorkes of the fleshe are adulterie, fornication, vncleannesse, vvantonnesse, Idolatrie, vvitchcraft
                        •…
                     , hatred debate, emulations, vvrath, contentions, seditions, heresies, envy, murthers, drunkennesse, gluttony, and they who doe such thinges shall not inherite the kingdome of God. And that Hebr: 13▪ 4. 
                  Whoremongers and adulterers God will iudge. That, as De ieiunio christi. Cyprian telleth vs, Fornicatours and adulterers haue thee Sathan for their suggestour: they shall have thee for their tormentour: revenging flames shall burne both thee and them. Concerning gluttony wee put them in minde of Christs speech, Luc: 21: 
                  Take heede vnto your selves least at any time your harte bee oppressed vvith surfetting and drunkennesse and cares of this life, and that daye came on you vn-avvares. And of that in Saint Paule, Rom: 13: 13: 
                  Let vs walke honestly as in the day, not in gluttony and drunkennesse, neither in chambering nor wantonnesse. To which may bee ioyned that of S. Ambrose, De Noe & Arca c: 9. 
                  What is more vnseemely then evermore to bee attending to the belly, which when it is filled is to be emptied, & when it is emptied, is to be filled againe? Touching ambitiō, we stirre mē vp, that they should imitate the modesty of Iohan: 1: 20: Iohn the Baptist, who tooke no honour to himselfe, but resigned it al to his master Christ. And the humility of S. Paul who avouched of himselfe & his felowes, 
                     r1: Thes: 2: 6: 
                  Neither sought we praise of mē, neither of you, nor of others. But especially the meekenesse of Christ our blessed Lord, who being vrged by his kinsmē to shew some Ioh: 7: 3: miraculous works so to make himselfe famous, refused, & would not cōdescēd to their humourous motion. And for the repressing of this sin, we cite that of S. Bernard, De considerat: ad Eugen: lib. 3: 1: 
                  O ambitiō the very crosse of those who be ambitious, how doest thou torturing al, please al? Nothing doth vex more bitterly: nothing doth disquiet more troublesomly, & yet amōg wretched mē there is nothing more ordinary thē the exercises therof. Lastly for Covetousnes, we say with Christ, Luc: 12: 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 
                  Take heede and beware of covetousnesse, for though a man
                  
                  haue abundance, yet his life standeth not in his riches. And with Saint Paule, 1. Tim: 6: 10. 
                  The love of mony is the roote of all evill, vvhich vvhile some lusted after, they erred from the faith
                        •…
                      and perced themselves through with many sorrowes. And wee thinke it not amisse to remember the covetous person of that in Saint Augustine, A

                     n full of faith, should have gone out to a crowne. These & the like doctrines out of the holy Scriptures & Fathers we do daily lay open to our hearers against these sins. Our Sermons and bookes are full of them: and on the other side we stirre them vp to chastity, to sobriety, to temperance, to humility, to bounty toward the poore, and therefore your reporte in this behalfe is a matter verie ordinarie vvith you and yours: but in the presence of God and men, a most malicious slaunder.
               19 You haue bin bold with vs already, making small spare and lesse conscience to laye vpon vs any vniust imputation, and the fowler, the more pleasing to you, and nowe forward you goe in the same, that is in your owne vaine. We must needs contemne S. Basile, S. Chrysostome, S. Hierome, and S. Augustine. Howe farre are we from despising them, the excellent lights of the Primitive Church, the noble instruments of Gods glory in their time, may be gathered from that which I have said before, frō our reading and studying of them, from the manifold printing & revising of them by men of our side, & that in diverse places, from our vsing of them in disputations, & our citing of them in the pulpit. Neverthelesse it is not to be expected that your malice should ever saye well. S. Basile wee reckon a famous Bishoppe of the East, Gregor. Naz. orat. 30: brought vp at Athens, & so cōpleted with humane literature, the equal, love, & deere cōpanion of that Gregory Nazianzen, who for his high & mystical knowledge in Divinity was thought worthy to be called with an excellency Theologus: whose worke touching the

                     merō. 6. daies of the creatiō, seemed so admirable, that S. Ambrose was cōtented to imitate it, yea almost to make himselfe

onely a trāslatour of it. The golden streames of S. Chrysostomes eloquence wee hold wel neere incomparable, & his frequent similitudes & comparisons to be so familiar, & yet so significant and lively, that wee account him scant worthy the name of an eminent preacher to the people, who hath not bin conversant in his works. We thinke S. Hierome for his learning not vnworthy to bee called a wonder of the world: his vniversal knowledge, & especially in the sacred tongues, togither with his ponderous style are honorable among all vvho knovve good letters. Saint Augustine for his iudgement goeth beyond them all: his reading was great as most of al appeereth in De civitate Dei, one tract of his, being the most noble of all his vvritings: his diligence, his zeale, and acutenesse against heretikes, have vvonne him everlasting prayse: and so doe vvee esteeme of his vvorkes, that we holde him much dis-furnished in the study of Divinity, especially for schoole-learning and grapling with an adversary, who is not wel acquainted with him. Such is the cōtempt that we cary to these reverend persons: nay if it were not for avoiding vnnecessary tediousnesse, vvee should much farther extoll their due-deserved commendation, VVhy then doe wee basely regard them? Because vvee bee given to lust and gluttony, and they have vvritten so excellently of the Order, Rule, and Vertues of Monkes. This hangeth wonderfull well togither. Doe all vvho are given to covetousnesse, ambition, gluttony, and lust, hate monkes and monkery, & al who haue prescribed good rules vnto them? Then your Pope and cardinals, and all the whole sinful Courte of Rome must stand arraigned for that crime: for eche man of any vnderstanding knoweth howe they abound in those vices. And besides if precepts for Monkery bee so contrary to these sinnes, must not the practise of them in a Monkish life be much more remote from them? And vvas it never heard that Nunryes or Monasteries of women, haue had many younge bones of little children found in them, which came not thither vvithout lust: or that many Monkes were little better thē mishapen gorbellied monstrous Epicures, vvhich arose not without gluttony: or that in the elections of their Priours, Abbots and Bishoppes, there vvas infinite competition, vvith all kinde

of striving, banding and canvasing, which was not without ambition: or that some of their vowed men (especially that famous fellowe mentioned by De moribus Germane. Aeneas Sylvius) have lefte great summes of money in secret behinde them, which were neither gotten nor kepte without avarice? Thus nothing can bee more certaine, then that men who loue the sinnes which you name, may be favourers of Monkes, & the Monastical creatures haue & do commonly bath themselues in such noted crimes.
               20 VVell, S. Basile hath written many things concerning Monkes. It may be questioned whether he hath or no for there is great doubte whether those bee his bookes vvherein most is contained touching that argument. But if we should allow you your desire, he hath no where saide more of that matter, then in a Serm: Quomodo ornaretur Monach: Sermon where he describeth the qualities of right mōkes, frō which qualities these late ones are very farre distant. And Saint In 1: Tim: Homil: 14. Chrysostome sheweth how holy & religious the Monasteries in his time were, to the which if these later Cloister-mē had kept thē we should haue found lesse to be discōmended in thē. Howbeit Chrysostome did not so much admire thē, that hee thought their life to be the only meanes of perfection, or that sanctitie and the true service of God, was scant any where to bee found but in them, which some doting ones in these ages not longe since past, have laboured to insinuate into the mindes of men. But he spake thus freely to the contrary: In Gen. Homil 43: 
                  where are they who sae that it is not possible, that a man living in the midst of a city should keepe vertue: but hee had neede of retyrednesse, and a certaine conversation amongst the mountaines, and that he who is over-seer of his owne house, and hath a wife and taketh care of children and servaunts cannot bee indued vvith vertue? Thus he supposed that men in a monastery might do well, and so might other also. S. Hierome who vppon some more then ordinary occasion with-drewe himselfe from Rome, and lived more privately in Palestina, grewe to be a Invita 
                        •…
                     ilarionis & saepè. hyperbolical commender of Heremites, monkes, and cloystered Virgins, which life he blazoneth so with his Rhetorical colours, that every man must confesse that his vvordes goe too farre if they be literally taken. And yet when diverse other were greedy to come from Rome to Hierusalem, that they might live there

sequestred as hee did, he disliked it, and saide that Epist: 13: heaven gate did stand open as well to a man in Britaine as at Hierusalem. Then were there in England fewe or no Monasteries at all. As for S. Austen hee describeth the piety and exercises of auncient De mo
                        •…
                     ib. Eccle Cathol. lib: 1: 31: Monkes and Caenobites of both sexes, and writing vppon the Psalmes he saith, In Ps. 99: 
                  In that common life of brethren which is in a Monastery, great holy men being daily in hymnes, in prayers, in the prayses of God, doe live therevpon. They meddle much with reading. They labour with their owne handes: thence theymaintaine themselves: they aske not any thing covetously. Whatsoever is brought in vnto them by godly brethren, they vse it with sufficiency & with charity. Nomā doth vsurpe to himselfe any thing, which anothermay not haue. All loue themselves: all sustaine one another. And yet the same S. Austen was not so simple, but that hee spied vnder this habite of holinesse much woolvishnes in his time, as cannot be cōcealed whē he said thus, Epist. 137. 
                  I doe plainely confesse vnto your charity, before our Lorde God who is a witnesse vpon my soule, since I began to serve God, as I hardly have found better men then those vvhich haue profited in monasteries, so I have not had triall of vvorse then those vvho have fallen in monasteries. And in his booke writen purposely cōcerning Monkes, hee describeth many monkes of his time to be De opere Monachorum c: 28: 
                  nought, idle, wandring vp & downe, setting at sale the relikes of martyrs, if they vvere the relikes of martyrs. Notwithstanding our late Votaries do lay closer hold on S. Austen then on any one of the Fathers: for they give it out that he was the founder of the Augustine Friers, and that rabble would derive their petigree from him, as some of the both olde and late Cloisterers woulde drawe their descent from Elias and Iohn the Baptist, which Sozom: 1: 12: Sozomen mencioneth to haue beene talked of in his time. For this purpose they give out that Saint Austen went in his monkishe coole and attire, cleane contrary to that which is reported in his life by Possidonius vvho lived with him. His 
                  Possidons in vita Aug, cap: 22: 
                  apparrell and shooes and bedde-stuffe, vvere of a moderate and competent quality, neither to neate nor too verie abiect, bicause in these for the most parte men doe either vse insoleutlie to boast themselves, or to abiecte themselves by both, not seeking those thinges vvhich are Iesus CHRISTES but their ovvne. But this blessed man as I saye kepte the meane, neither declining to the right hand nor
                  
                  to the lefts. Thus saith Possidonius, wherevpon Erasmus fitly asketh this question, Observat. in margine 
                  UUhere was thou the letherne girdle and the blacke coule? But besides this, they haue forged certaine Ad fratres in eremo. books in the name of S. Augustine, as if he the Bishoppe of Hippon, had given orders and instructions to his Friers vnder him. But this is as like the worke of S. Austen, as an Owle is like an Eagle, or a Cuckow to a Nightingale, as the improbability of many things vvhich are in it, the basenesse of the matter, the barbarousnesse of the stile, the foolish and shamelesse narrations, and many other thinges maye demonstrate to every one who hath but halfe an eie, or one graine of salt in him. Yet so must Popery bee peeced togither, with a faire title at the least although the stuffe be rotten.
               21 Heere looke we backe a little to the ancient Monkes: and not any way curiously to trace their originall, were there not even almost in the very time of their first institution many absurdities and incongruous superstitions which did creepe in, every one by a voluntary will-worship adding what he thought good? Was not the great Sozo. 1: 13 Anthony who had so many followers, a man vtterly vnlearned, and did not he thinke even the least knovvledge a hinderance to his speculatiue devotion? Did not the Heremits shew great presumption, when being but simple persons diverse of them, they wilfully refused the society of men, & the fellowship of cōmunion of Saints, by their solitarynesse putting themselues more freely vpō Sathans temptations, by debarring their soules of the word preached, the Sacrament of the Lordes supper received, and the comfort of the Minister or any other Christian brother? Did not the too exquisite severity of Lib: 3: 13: Eustathius the Monke (who is supposed to be the true authour of the book intituled 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , & cōmonly reported to be S. Basiles, where so much is of the life & discipline of Monks) grow to absurd observations, and such as were quite disagreeing from the laws Ecclesiastical? There are reckoned vp many opinions of him & his scholers, which were condemned in a Councel at Gangrae, as that he disliked mariage, would not pray in their houses who were wedded, despised maryed Priests, thought rich men to be shut out frō heaven, detested those who eate flesh, and other such like monkish

imaginations. Some women perswaded by him or his, leste their husbands, put on mens apparrel, and fell to adultery. These persons lived about the time of the fore-named Fathers, who in their bookes cōmended the good parts which were then exercised, & doubtles gaue those precepts which they did giue, to reforme the abuses. And as succeeding generations came on, did not the superstitious devises of Monks increase, as is to be seene in Evagrius? Some did shut themselues into little houses, Evagr: hist Eccl. l: 1: 21: which were so low & narrow, as that they could neither stand vpright in thē, nor ly otherwise then double. Some both men & women living in the wildernes did onely cover their privities, & for the rest went naked both in the hottest & coldest wether. Some refusing all foode of men, did eate only the grasse of the ground, & would not endure the presence of any persons, but woulde run away and hide them in the rockes. Other counterfeyting themselues fooles laboured to bee without all passion. These woulde not refuse to goe into tavernes or brothel-houses: they would be in bathes with women, and as among men they lived as men, so among women they were as women. Yet did those ages so doate vpon monkery, that even these were commended, and helde for holy men. Thus if wee take these olde lads in their best times, they had imperfections inough, but of the good qualities which were in any of them those vvho came after embraced but a few. Onely the ignorance of Anthony went almost currant through all: that was as good as hereditary to them. But the olde devoute service of God was of late turned into hypocrisie, fasting into perpetuall belly-cheere, scarcity and penury into aboundance and lordly possessions of landes, charity was converted into hart-burning and envie, humility into pride, sobriety into Venereous and Sodomitish lust: their piety was but formality, their idolatry was infinite. Thus it grewe forwarde by little and little, till it came to the height of vngodlinesse. Howe soone this beganne maye bee gathered by him vvho vvrote the treatise commonlye called Cyprians, De duplici martyrio, There vvee thus read, Cypr. de dupl. mart. 
                  Not anie deserte place, sacke-cloath for a garment, pulse for meate, neither fasting nor lying on the bare grounde doe make a perfect monke: Under these covers lyeth hid sometimes a minde verie
                  
                  worldly, which is so discovered if they bee called to any Ecclesiasticall office. There you shall see some of them most easilie to bee overcome vvith delightes, more impatient of iniuries, more desirous of vengance then any other of the ordinarie people. What is the cause? Because they haue more exercised the body then the minde. This began betimes: but as they grew in yeares, so many of them grew in horrible wickednes. It is a long while since Eccl. Hist. Ang: l: 4: 25 Beda lived: yet in his Ecclesiasticall story he mencioneth that a Monastery called Colindiurbem was consumed with fire, for the lasciviousnes and wantonnes which was there founde in both men and women. So did God punish them. But in S. Bernards time a carnall kinde of behavior had over-growne almost all, which caused him earnestly & passionatly to complaine, Bernard. in cena Domini cap: 3. 
                  How many monkes be there in S. Benedicts monastery, who do laugh when other men doe mourne; who reioice when other are sadde. In their bodie they are cloistered, in their mindes wanderers and never standing still. Slow to their reading, tardy to their praying, in the Church sleeping, in the refectory vvaking. For their long watchings grieving, but for their long bankets reioicing. This was the mortified life of many monkes in that holy mans daies. And how this was afterwarde amended in England, may bee testified by the survey, which by Visitation of the Kings Commissioners was taken vnder King Henry the eight of famous memory, when by othes of the religious persons themselues, much Sodomitry & other vncleannesse was detected, and afterwarde was published to the world by a printed booke, some notes wherof are to be seene in the French Apology of Cap. 21: Henry Stephanus made in defence of Herodotus. Such small affinity had and haue your late monkes, with those of whom we read among the old writers. But for absurdities of doctrin, especially in commending themselues, they go beyond all those of auncient times, as I will instaunce in the Franciscanes, who maintaine these points which yet are disliked by some other Papists, and by some other excused or defended. I will cite them out of a great Papist and a Capuchine, Frier Gregory of Naples.

                   That the rule of S. Francis, is that life of Iesus Christ which himselfe observed in this world, & imposed on his In libris corrigēdis. Apostles to keepe, and caused to be written in the Gospels, and that whosoever doe contradict this rule of S. Francis, do contradict

or impugne the Gospel of Christ, and if they persevere in it, are heretikes▪ That S. Frauncis is the Angell of whom it is said in the Apocalyps, I saw another Angell having the seale of the living God. That no man can bee damned who weareth the habite of S. Francis (that is to say, saith this favourable interpreter, who togither with the habite beareth workes appertaining to salvation) That once a yeare S. Francis descendeth to Purgatory, and draweth out from thence their soules who living were of his order, and leadeth them to Paradise (that is saith the interpreter Capuchine, he goeth not actually in his owne person, but by his vertue, in as much as hee intreateth the Maiestye of God for his brethren, & Gods clemency giveth him pardon for some souls.) That the order of S. Francis shal endure for ever. Thus they teach their Novices, bring vp their Friers and preach vnto the people. There must needs be much vertue, goodnes, and mortification, where they speake so hypocritically for themselues, & so basely or blasphemously for Christ our Saviour.

                     d. in vita Iuel Iewel not impudētly, but Christiāly, & vpō great deliberatiō & advise did chalēge any English Papist to shew out of the Fathers of the first sixe hundred yeeres diverse pointes of Popery, as their private Masse, or that the cōmuniō was administred but in one kind, or that publike praiers were saide in a language not vnderstood, or that the Pope was called the vniversal Bishop, or the head of the church, or that mē were taught this faith, that the body of Christ was contained in the Sacrament substantially, really, corporally, carnally, or that Christes body was at once in a thousand places, or that there was elevatiō & adoratiō of the Eucharist, & diverse such other matters, which the Bishop did constantly deny, not to be knowen or taught in those times of the first Church. The substance of this An. 1560: Sermon made at Paules Crosse did D. Humfrey rehearse, writing the life of the saide M. Iewel, and afterward interserting his ovvne iudgement concerning many matters in difference, hee groweth to this head that the onely exacte way of reformation of abuses & of determination of truth, is the vvorde of GOD; that it alone is to bee made the iudge. Vppon vvhich insisting, hee inferreth that therefore Maister

Iewell gaue too much, and yeelded to the Papistes more then equity, and was too iniurious to himselfe, when hee tooke not the surer, easier & shorter course of triall by the Scriptures alone, but gaue larger scope of expatiating into the Councels & Fathers. But most absurdly is your Popish conclusion gathered out of this, that therfore D. Humfrey knew or confessed that the Fathers of the Primitiue Church were against vs and him. You should rather haue inferred thus much, that D. Humfrey thought that M. Iewell had a sure matter in hand, when needing to referre all but to the Scriptures, he appealed also to the Fathers; that both by the witnesse of God and man he might avouch his assertions. In case of triall for land, we know that authentical writings and evidences are the best and most absolute meanes of deciding right: but if he who oweth and possesseth the writings, knowing the integritie of his cause, shall not refuse also to haue his quarrell tried by the testimonies of indifferēt mē in the coūtrey, he hath departed so much from his owne right, and done more then he need to do. If then his friend shoulde say, that therein hee hath yeelded to more then meete, and did himselfe a wrong by it, by yeelding his adversary many exceptions, wheras he might haue tyed him onely to one, should not a stander by make an absurd collectiō, if he should gather vpon this, that the litigants friend savv well that the witnesse of the Countrey would goe against him? And especially when he whom it most concerneth, shall by the testimony of those to whom he appealed, make good all his asseverations? This was the Bishops case, and no otherwise then thus was it reported by the Venerable Doctour. And albeit this may appeare to bee thus to every one who will read the narration, yet because Bristow, Campian and you take it all one from another, and other may yet take it farther, & your people be still abused, as if so learned a man as D. Humfrey, had both disliked M. Iewels words, and given sentence touching the Fathers against vs; for the farther satisfaction of the Reader, I desire these thinges to be marked. First that Doctour Humfrey in that booke concerning M. Iewell, as also in his Secund: pars Iesuitis other against Campian, doth frequently cite the old Fathers for vs, in all questions of difference that occurre, Ergo he doth not thinke that the Doctors are all on the

Papists side, and not on the Protestants. Secondly that in'all his Lectures, Disputations and Sermons he was most copious in citing and alleaging the ol

Thirdly to this particular, that in the very Fol. 124: place where he speaketh of the Bishops challenge, he putteth these wordes before; And here is necessarily to be repeated that Protestation or denunciation, which was heard out of this place of Paules Crosse, which our adversaries doe calumniate to bee vaine and frivolow: which notwithstanding they will not deny to be true who are of the better sort of wit, and of more excellent learning. Can a man speake plainer then the Doctour doth here, iustifying that to be true which the Bishop said, and calling the adversaries exception to the Challenge, a calumniation? Fourthly that in the Fol. 212: place where he saith that M. Iewell yeelded too much, when he went to farther triall then the Bible, he subioineth this, Which he did not willingly, but yet he did it not besides the purpose, that he might s

               23 YOur hatred to the Gospell maketh you easily giue sinister interpretations to our actions. We mencion the Fathers in our Sermons, to shew that our expositions of Scripture are not singular and 2. Pet. 1. 20 private interpretations, but such as were received in the Primitiue Church; & to convince the Antichristian enemy, who like Iack Bragger boasteth of antiquity, when in comparison of Gods booke, his beliefe is nothing else but noveltie. It is not because wee woulde blinde the eies of the people, or stoppe their eares, since as you say to teach doctrine contrary to those Auncients soundeth ill: for if there be iust cause, we plainly and evidently shew where we dissent from them. Which wee doe being warranted by the word of God, which Galat: 1: 8 teacheth vs that if an Angell come from heaven, and preach otherwise then the Apostles haue preached, we should hold him accursed: And incited there vnto by some of the Fathers themselues in open wordes, by other in their Orthodoxe meaning. For what Father woulde dare to thinke, that his speeches shoulde over-rule the Scripture? As for wringing and wresting and straining, we detest it. Gods truth needeth not to be vpheld by vntruthes. We leaue that to the masons of the Popes part, who had need vse such supporters to vnder-proppe the rotten and dayly falling ruines of their Antichristian kingdome. Now whereas you tell vs that he is most praised of the Auditory, who most alleageth the Doctors, you had need to help your selfe with more then one distinctiō. For among sober & wise hearers, it is wel accepted when the Fathers are cited to good purpose & orderly: but some other there be who thinke themselues no meane folkes, which on a humorousnesse and because their Preachers are ignorant that way, & they, I meane those ignorant Pastours haue taught them so, like not to heare them quoted in the Pulpit. Againe the wisest congregation doth not approue of the preposterous vsing of them,

as vvhen they are cited frequently and yet onely in Latine or Greeke, and not Englished to the edification of the people, vvhich Saint 1. Cor. 14. 26. Paule vvoulde ever have aimed at: Or vvhen they are hudled one vppon anothers necke vvithout cause; Or vvhen they are multiplyed rather for ambition, then vppon desire of fruite or vtility. You might have considered vppon these thinges, but you vvith the Crocodile or Hyena fall rather to a counterfeite commiseration, that it is a pityfull thinge, that the people shoulde bee made beleeve, that the Doctours vvere of the same opinion that vvee are in religion. You may doe well to taxe those men, who in their Sermons have abused or perverted the sentences of those grave and learned personages. Of the two you should rather pity your Papisticall Congregations, vvhich are little troubled vvith Scriptures or Doctours, but vvith such miracles and fabulous Legendes, as your Friers doe lay before them, and nothing else. So are they turned to puddle waters, in steede of the cleere streaming fountaine of the vvater of life. That our Preachers who have reade any of the Fathers themselves, doe know that they make against that vvhich they preache, is an idle suspicious surmise of your owne, and nothing else but a falling backe by a Nugatio to that vvhich you formerly have spoken. It is one of the highest breaches of conscience, for a man standing in the place of God to speake to the people, there to vrge that vvhich in his ovvne harte hee knoweth contrary to truth. This is inough for Bellarmine and such desperate wretches, vvho for a Cardinals hat or some other expectation, have solde themselves and their soules to their LORD God the Pope, and his LORD God the Devill.

                  Lactantius in his bookes, but especiallye in his Epistles ad Demetrianum, doth altogether denye the substance of the holye Ghost, and by a levvishe errour doth saye, that it is either referred to the Father or to the Sonne, and that the sanctification of either person is intended vnder the name of it, that is, the holye Ghost. And had not Hierome himselfe those thinges in him, vvhich cannot bee defended? As his Contr. lovinian. immoderate preferring of single life before mariage, and his Aug: Epist. 19: pertinacious advouching that Saint Peter did not deserve to bee reprehended by Saint Paule for Gal: 2: 12: halting vvith the Iewes. Chrysostome besides his too forward testimonies for freewill, which Papistes themselves dislike, is of minde & Hom: 3: in Epist: ad Philip. & Hom 11. in 1. ad Cor. teacheth it, that although men dye in sinne, be condemned and in hell, yet almes and ostrings & other helpes of praiers done by them who are alive, may ease them and diminishe some measure of their tormentes. Neither doth Saint Augustine want his imperfections, as whē he determineth that all children dying without Epist 28. Baptisme go to the flames of hell, which the Romanistes nowe wil not admit: And whē he liketh their iudgment, who thought that vpon hazard of their salvation the Epist. 106. & 107. Eucharist was to be administred to Infantes. Many more such examples might be added of vndoubted errours, in these learned mē, wherin I trust no Papist is so absurde, as to prescribe vnto vs that we should ioyne with them, least of good Christians we should become lovers of errours, and in some things embracers of heresyes. Besides these vnquestionable over-sightes, it falleth out ofte, that the Fathers do some of them differ, nay are contrary or cōtradictory in iudgment, some to other, and some to themselves. What shal we doe in this case, or whom shal we follow, if the bare authority of these writers be of it selfe so stronge, as they would make it? I will not instaunce in those hereticall or erroneous opinions before named, where some of them affirme and some Orthodoxely deny, and a Christian man without the Scripture can give no decision vvhether is in the right: Cull out that onely for example sake, vvhere Hierome and Augustine doe so differ, about Saint Peter and Saint Paule, vvhether of them did amisse; hovve

should we know but by the Apostles writing? But to whether of them in this contradictorie case shulde vvee give credite, if they vvere considered in themselves? Neither vvill I instaunce matters of meane respecte, as hovve Saint Quaest. 123 sup Exod. & qu. 81. sup. Levitie. Austen crosseth himselfe in this question, whither the Cydaris vvere an attire for the heade or no: Or vvhether Plato spake personally vvith the Prophet Ieremie in Aegypte and learned of him many thinges, or no, to the which being the iudgement of Ambrose in one De doctr. Christ: lib: 2: 28 place hee assenteth, but in De civit: Dei l. 8: 11: another hee speaketh against it. But I rather referre men to their differences about the Canonicall Scripture, vvhich Responsad Ration. 8. before I have shewed; and vvhich is a matter of greate momente. Or to those thinges which Saint Augustine himselfe In libr: Retract: retracted in his owne vvorkes. Or to those different iudgementes in capitall causes, vvhich Bellarmine citeth in infinite places, and Sixtus In Bibliothe casācta. Senensis in verie many. Or to such like as that of Gregory, where one vvhile hee saith that Cornelius by those Homil: 9: in Ezechi. vvorkes vvhich vvent before his faith did merite that hee afterward might haue faith, and another Homil: 19. while hee expressely denyeth that, and saith that by faith hee came to his workes. Now if there bee such doubtes as these in the Fathers, or other like, and we cannot be resolved out of these Doctours; or if question be of the verity of their doctrine, whither must we haue recourse? The Papistes will say to the Church of Rome, that is to thēselves, but the Fathers wil tell vs to the word of God, as forth-with I shal shewe: which every way discovereth the base weakenesse of the vnCatholike Church, since the Doctors are not the touch-stone of truth, but are themselves to be tried by some thing else: they are not selfesufficient, but all their words are to be weighed in the ballaunce of the Sanctuarie, where if they beare waight, they are to be accepted, if they be found too light, they are to bee reiected. Our ground then and foundation is not in these men, although never so worthy men, but the booke of God must make the finall and irrefragable decision.
               26 For the better establishing of this, let vs heare the Fathers themselves speake. I put Saint Augustine in the foremost ranke, as one vvho had most occasion to deale in this argument. In

the controversie betweene him & Hierome, he is Epist. 19: pressed with the authority of other writers. Hee answereth, I doe confesse vnto your charity, I have learned to give this reverence and honour to those onely bookes of Scriptures which are called Canonicall, that I doe most firmely beleeve, that no authour of them did erre in writing any thing. To other then hee taketh exception. Hee speaketh elsewhere plainer: Epist. 48. 
                  The Fathers are not so reade, as if a testimony might bee so drawne out of them, that it were not lawfull to thinke contrariwise, if they have otherwise suppo
                        •…
                     ed then the truth did require. And againe, Epist. 113. 
                  I have put the opinions of so great men &c. not that I doe thinke them to be followed as the Canonical Scripture. And whē he was hard pressed in the Controversie of Baptisme with the authority of Cyprian, hee aunswereth Cresconius, Contr. Crescen. Grāmatic: lib: 2
                        •…
                     . 
                  I esteeme the letters of Cyprian not as Canonicall, but I consider them out of the Canonicall, and looke vvhat agreeth in them to the authoritie of the Divine Scriptures, vvith praise to him I receive, vvhat doth not agree, vvith his good leave I refuse. And afterward, Because that is not Canonical, vvhich thou r
                        •…
                     est, vvith that libertie to vvhich GOD hath called vs, I doe not receive that vvhich savoured amisse of that man vvhose praise I cannot attaine vnto, to vvhose many letters I doe not compare my vvritinges, vvhose vvitte I lone, vvith vvhose speech I am delighted. whose charity I doe admire, whose martyrdome I hold venerable. Can ought be delivered more significantly, and to our purpose then this is? And least that any man should suspect that hee was more strictly laced toward other men, thē he would have other toward him, he frequently writeth as modestly of himselfe, as he doth wisely of those who went before him. As to Epistol: 7: Marcellinus, I therefore doe confesse my selfe to bee of the number of them, vvhe in profiting doe vvrite, and in vvriting doe profite. VVherevpon if any thing bee set dovvne by mee, either vnvvarily or vnlearnedly, which not onely by other men vvho can see that, may bee vvorthily reprehended, but also of my selfe, because even I at least aftervvard ought to see it, if I doe profite, it is neither to be wondered at, nor to be grieved at, but rather it is to be pardonned, and to bee reioyced at, not because there hath beene an errour, but because it hath beene disliked. For that man doth too perversely love himselfe, vvho vvill have other men also to erre, that his errour may lye hid. And to Fortunatianus, Epist. 111. 
                  Neither
                  
                  are wee to account the disputations, of any men, though Catholikes and commendable persons, as the Canonical Scriptures: that saving the honour which is due vnto those men, it is not lawfull for vs to dislike and reict some thing in their writings, if perhaps we shal find that they haue otherwise thought, then that truth hath, which by the helpe of God, hath either bin vnderstood by others, or by vs. Such a one am I in the writings of other mens & such would I have the vnderstāders of mine to be. And handling the high mysteries of the Trinity, he saith, De Trinit at: l. 1. 3: 
                  Whosoever readeth these things, where he is alike sure, let him go on with me, where alike hee doubteth let him seeke vvith mee, vvhere hee knovveth his errour let him returne to me, vvhere hee spieth mine, let him recall mee. And in the same booke else-where, Lib.

                  Let the one not love mee more then the Catholike faith, let the other not love himselfe more then the Catholike truth, As I say to the one, doe not attend on my writings as on the Canonical Scriptures &c. This is the minde of Saint Augustine.
               27 Neither doth this renoumed servant of God heerein goe alone, but he hath sufficient of others, who in this be halfe do second him. The great Dionysius, not the supposed Areopagite, but another worthy man since his time, did long ago informe vs in this doubt: Eusebius bringeth him in speaking thus: Eccles. Hist l 7: 19: 
                  I do very much reverence Nepos, yet truth is the neerest friend of all, and ought deservedly to be preferred before all. And if any thing be rightly spoken, that is to be commended without envy, but if any thing bee committed to writing not sincerely and soundly, this with diligence is to bee sought out, & to be reprooved. To this effect also are the words of S, Hierome: I 
                  Epist: 62: 
                  doe know that I my selfe doe esteeme of the Apostles in one sort, and of other writers in another sort: that the first do alwaies speake the truth, and the latter as men doe in some things erre. Adde to these that of Theodoret, who saith that, Dialog. 3.

                     ent contention against their adversaries doe many times exceede measure. Thus they vse to do who plant trees. For whē they see a tree growne crooked, they do not onely set him vp vpright, but they doe bende him to the other side, that by too much inclining to the contrarie parte, they may cause it to bee straight. This is the iudgement of the auncient vvriters themselves, concerning the workes of one another, that they go too farre, that they do & may erre, that they are not

to be ioyned in equal estimatiō with the Canonical Scriptures: And therfore what reasō have we not to vse our Christiā liberty in examinig of thē by the rule of truth, so to embrace that which is right, and to repudiate that which is of another nature? I doe marveile then what advauntage our Papistes doe thinke they can gette, by craking vppon the names of these, since their authority even in their ovvne iudgement is not absolute and Dictatourlike, but vvith a reference, and meerely dependent vppon a higher commaunder: In which case if they stoope to the scepter of the LORD, wee willingly and readily admit of them vvith due honour and reverence; othervvise we leaue them. But the tryer of them we hold to be the Canonical Scripture of the olde and new Testament.
               28 On the other side how the Synagogue of Rome (speake they of these Doctours never so faire) doe deale vvith them, it is good that every vveake Christian shoulde know. For howsoever they in their vvordes pretende greate honour to them. yet in truth they are the onely men in the vvorlde, vvho offer notorious vvronge to them. For first, how are they debased, when such lights of the Easterne and VVesterne Church, men so fraughted vvith knowledge, and adorned vvith eloquence, shall not onely bee sette in comparison vvith, but set after the Popes barbarous champion Thomas of Aquine? Noble Hierome thou hast vvell studyed, and renoumed Augustine thou hast wel laboured, to come to such a preferment in thine old age. For one of the Popes Aug: Hū
                     naeus in praefat, Sūmm. Aquinat. ad, Pium 5. Pontific. Innocents, did so much esteeme the learning of Aquinas, that he doubted not to give vnto him the first place after the Canonical Scripture. Which albeit originally it be but the censure of one man, yet knowe that he was Bishoppe of Rome, and when it is prefixed before the Summe of Aquinas, & dedicated to another Pope, it is intended to bee of credite, and that more must be of that mind if they thēselues wil. And Icon. & vite Papar. in Pio: 5: since that time Pius the 5. hath placed the same Aquinas fifte among the Doctou
                     •…
                   of the Church, to the greate preiudice and dishonour of all the rest. Secondly vvhat dishonour doe they, to the renoumed company of those admirable men, vvhen they ranke vvith them, and as it vvere thrust vppon them, base

companions, a bastardlye broode, vvhich have no learning, iudgement or anie other eminente parte to commend them? Of their counterfeit Dionysius Areopagite I have spoken before. But Maister Harding vvriting against Bishoppe lewel citeth in his greatest matters, L. Humfry. in vita luelli. Amphilochius, Abdias, Leontius, Martialis Simon Metaphrastes, Hippolitus, Vincentius, Clemens, Cletus, Anacletus, counterfeit Athanasius and Basile, and other authours of Decretall Epistles in steede of true Fathers. And Bellarmine in his disputes beeing many times neere driven, is glad to flye to such, as for a stake to a hedge. This is to extenuate the reputation of those greate starres, and to make them to be meanely thought of, because those vvith vvhomethey are sorted, deserve no better. It is the disgrace of the best, when those of vvorst qualitye are coupled vvith them as their fellowes. In the time of Bodin: de Rep: l: 5: 4: Pope Iulius the thirde the Cardinals of Rome knevve this; vvhen seeing the Pope to create Montanus Cardinall, one vvhome for his pleasures sake he had taken out of a most beggerly estate, & brought him vp at home, they ioyned in a request and motion in behalfe of the College of Cardinals, that hee vvould not suffer that honourable degree to bee stayned by the presence of so contemtible a man, vvho had neither vvealth, nor vvisedome, nor vertue, nor parentage, nor learning, nor any thinge to commend him. Indeed the Pope there had thē at the advātage, for he was able to beate them with their own rodde, & therfore replyed vpon them, VVhat vertues I pray you, what learning, vvhat parentage, what good qualities vvas I famous for, vvhen you made mee Pope? His personall reproofe to them vvas iust; othervvise their sute had beene reasonable: for such a consort coulde no vvay honest their College; as these silye Popishe authours doe no way adde estimation, but manifold dis-reputation to the Fathers. Thirdly howe shamefully did the predecessours of these late Papists, in the time of darke ignorance foist in parts of tracts, and whole treatises into the volumes of the Fathers, so labouring that new writings might runne currant for old, vpstarts for natural, & very draffe & chaffe for good corne. There is seāt any one of the Fathers which hath escaped free herein, not Cyprian, not

Austen, not Hierome, out of whose works many bookes & peeces may be pulled, which for the matter or style doe no more refēble those authours, thē Aesops Asse did a Liō, whē he had got that Roial beasts skinne on his backe. The Popish Censurers in their editiōs do cōfesse so much, but Erasmus a mā who had the gift of 1: Cor: 12: 10. 
                  discerning of spirits did go beyond them al, and in his prefaces, arguments, or Censures vpon bookes, doth yeelde the reasons of his opinion. It is incredible to thinke how absurde things are fathered on these Doctours, as by name that Adfratres in eremo before said to be intituled to Saint Austen, where the absurde fellow sometimes plainly taketh vpō him the name of Austē Bishop of Hippon, but to procure admiration saith Serm: 37. that he traveiled into Aethiopia, & saw there men without heades, with their eies set in their brest, and others he beheld which had onely one eye in the middle of their fore-head. I wishe that either Sir Iohn M Hac
                     
                        •…
                     its ving. Maundevile had beene with him, or he with Sir Iohn Maundevile. This tricke of iugling in such tractes, is a daungerous matter to any who vvill rest himselfe too farre vppon the Fathers vvritinges: and our Popishe people haue in their fraude greate advauntage, vvhen out of such as they are, they vvill confirme their Paradoxes. But there is another pointe more tickle then this, vvhen their Monkes and Cloister men vvould intersert into the true and proper workes of the best writers, whole leafes, or pages or sentences, more or lesse to serve for their purpose. Erasmus who laboured exceedingly in repairing and restoring antiquity, & to whose paines al learned men do owe much, cōplaineth bitterly of this; as in one of his Lib: de spirit. sāct. prefaces to a booke of S. Basile, he with griefe saith, that the same measure was affoorded to Basile, which he had otherwise experimented in Athanasius, Chrysostome, Hierome, and that vvas, that in the middle of treatises, many thinges vvere stuffed and forced in by other, in the name of the Fathers. Hēce the Romish generatiō might build even what pleased thēselves. But besides all this, as in other artes so in Divinity & in the writings of the Doctours, by the ignoraunce of the Novices, in Monasteries sette to write out Copies of bookes, yea of their Vives de canis corrupr: art: lib: 1. Nunnes so imployed, diverse argumentes of bookes vvere put into the bookes themselves,

and Annotations in the Marge 
                     •…
                  t were erepte into the texte. Concerning this depravation of learned mens vvorkes in all kindes. Lodovicus Vives hath written diverse bookes intituled, Of the causes hovve or vvhy the artes vvere corrupted, and hath there many observations and complaintes, that some ignorauntly, some maliciously, all audaciously did such thinges. I thinke it not amisle to cite one sentence of his, vvhich shevveth hovve diverse counterfeite bookes had the names of noble Authours put vppon them. Among such as did vvrite out volumes, Libr: 1: 
                  there vvere some vvho to procure authoritie to a booke, did in writing put to it the name of some greate authour: other, that when in times past many bookes vvere put out vvithout names, being mooved vvith some very light coniecture, did adiudge it to one or to another: other if they did not knowe the name of the title, did not doubt to chaunge it, and to transferre it to vvhome they thought good: there were such as vvrote out bookes, vvho looke vvhat name came first in their mind, that they did sette before for the title. There bee manie examples of all these thinges, in those authours vvhome even novve I named, Aristotle, Plato, Origen, Cyprian, Hierome, Augustine, Boetius, Cicero, Seneca, and all these have beene received vvithout difference, and no lesse authority and credite given to them, then to those which were true and naturall. This is a noble testimony of a very learned man, who spent much traveile purposely in this argument, and sheweth by what sinister meanes such came to bee reputed Fathers, who were more fit to bee taken for children.
               29 Fourthly I name that which is most horrible of all other, even a manifest evidence of a desperate cause, and that vvhich is rotten at the roote. VVherein the impudency and shamelesse fore-head of the vvhore of Babylon and her Peeres, can never sufficientlye bee exclaimed vppon, albeit heaven and earth, and all the creatures therein bee called to vvitnesse. For hath this Antichristian broode so longe fledde from the Scriptures to the Fathers, and haue they and doe they so crake of these every where, and are they nowe forced to raze them, and pare them, and blurre them, else they cannot hould vp their irreligion? This is the case of vvhich I desire all my weake

and abused country-men to take notice. In the Conventicle of Trent there were certaine Index Expurgar. Belgic. in Regul. Cō
                     cil: Tridentini. rules made, vvhich openlye did pretend the purging and clensing of bookes from hereticall matters, but secretly intende more, even to raze out what they thinke fitte out of olde or newe, as their practise in this behalfe doth testifie, vvhich is vvarranted by the covert orders there concluded. For this businesse, in diverse places of the Papacy, vvere secretly appointed some of their owne stampe, men conscience-lesse and fitte for any vile acte, to revise as well the Fathers, as later bookes of all sortes, and vvhatsoever made against Popery and could not handsomely bee glosed, should vppon the newe printing of the bookes by Printers in Popishe places, bee cunningly altered or quite lefte out. This must bee done, notwithstanding that all the copies even formerly printed by themselves, and many written ones in their libraries, and as many in ours, did plainely shevve the contrarie. Yea though marveilous store of copyes, vvritten hundreds of yeeres before, vvhen as neither Luther, nor Hus, nor Wiclefe vvere yet borne, did concurre in that for which we plead. Heere-vppon closely vvas dravvne first An: 1571. one Index Expurgatorius, by the vvarrant of Philippe the second King of Spaine, and of the Duke of Alva Governour of the Lovve Countryes for him. There in the Kinges letters patentes prefixed before the booke, charge is given that in every city where booke-sellers dvvell, there shoulde bee some Prelates appointed to supervise all noted bookes, and that Diploma Regis Catholici Belgic. 
                  they should have vvith them privatelye, and no other men knovving of it, one Index Expurgatorius, vvhich they shoulde neither communicate vnto others, nor graunt a copy of it to any man, but only shall most diligently take care of that, that they inquire vppon, expunge, and restore the places before spoken of. According to this, were al the new printed bookes proceeded withall by them, and our men not knowing the mystery wondred at those things which were left out and altered, but could not gesse at the true cause, till about fifteene An: 1587: yeeres after, Franciscus Iunius by Gods speciall providence light vpon one of them, and published it to the vvorlde. Sutable to this vvas there by the commaundement of Pope An. 1572. Pius the 5. a

Censure vpon the Glosses of the Canon Lawe closely framed by Frier Thomas Manriq. Maister of the holy and Apostolike Palace, and the same by the An: 1580: mandate of Pope Gregory the 13. was afterward reviewed by Sixtus Faber also Maister of the same Palace Apostolike, and according therevnto were the Glosses of the Canon Lavv printed, all thinges being blotted out which made against the Romishe faith. This also vvas concealed, as the Index Expurgatorius had beene before, till that An: 1599: latelye Doctour Iohn Pappus mette vvith it, and published it to the view of all vvho vvill reade it. I finde also F. Gregor. Capuch: in libris Corrig: fol: 166: mention of a Censure concerning certaine Authours, vvhich vvas put out in Spaine in the yeere 1562. but the booke it selfe is not yet come (for ought that I knowe) to anye of our handes. But after that, by the meanes of Gaspar Quiroga Cardinall and Archbishoppe of Toledo, beeing also cheefe Inquisitour in Spaine, 
                  An: 1584: Madriti apud Alphons. Gomezium Regiū Typograph. there was printed another Index Librorum Expurgatorum, which was not without the advise of the highe Sonate of the holy Generall Inquisition. This booke also vvas unknovvne to any Protestant, vntill that her late Maiesties forces taking the tovvne of An. 1596: Calez in Spaine, there vvas one of these Indices founde there, vvhich beeing brought into England, was by a M. Tho. Iames. man carefull to laye open such fraudes, sent to the L. of Plessis into Fraunce, vvho keeping the originall in his ovvne Library, An: 1601: printed it at Saumure, and made it knowne to the bodye of Christendome. In the beginning of this edition it is shevved, that they thrust out diverse thinges of their ovvne vvriters, as out of the vvoorkes of Osorius, Ferus, a booke called Edit: Venetijs An: 1576.

Yea out of the Glosse on Epiphanius, and from the Tables in the endes of the woorkes of Chrysostome, Hilary, Hierome, Cyril of Alexandria, vvhen notvvithstanding the matters to bee put out and razed, are either literally or in sence apparantly, and not to bee spoken against, in the Texte of those Fathers. Nay in the Index of the Bibles put out by Robert Stephanus, these propositions must bee blotted out as suspect, Ioh: 11. 26:

                     r. libr. I do ever burne. And I make an experiment in the 3. Chapter of Genesis, where I finde, In the sweate of thy face thou shall eate breade, vntil thou returne vnto the earth, & he doth not say, In the sweate of thy face thou shalt eate thy breade, vntill &c. I without remission as a texte suspect, do not passe to it, censuring it; but setting it on fire. Now if it be a defect to put it bread and not thy bread, it is such a defect as is in the Hebrew, & our bookes reade it commonly in Latin & other languages without thy, & so do most of the Vulgar Popish editions for ought that I can finde. And if it be a fault to put thy to the texte, it should rather be chastised for a superfluity then for a defect. Talking of his Correction of a booke of Iacobus Spieglius, he hath these words, Fol. 199 & Idem fere. fol. 217: 
                  Which correction I do put, not that it is to be accounted for a perfect correction, that it should neede no farther amending: but only satisfying my duty, that it may bee knowne that it is to be corrected, & that at least it should be corrected as followeth, till there come a better correction put out with greater consideration: since I finde by experience that too day I see a booke or aleafe, & by various businesses of my mind I do not iudge him to be worthie greater correction, & on the morrow vpon a new cōsideration, I do iudge him to be worthy of correctiō.
                  
                  And therefore I do notifie thus much that as well the booke following as these before are worthy of correctiō: & if they be corrected after the mā
                     ner mētioned, easily according to the Trent Index, there may by the most Reverend Bishops leave be given to reade them, till some farther correction do appeere. This is a good plaine fellow, & therfore telleth vs that once amending of a booke will not suffice, but they will to it againe and againe. Fol: 215: Else-where he saith that among them the Revisers, there is a note of three hūdred & fifty Authours which are suspected, & are to be over-vewed. Fol: 218: Finally he deepely findeth fault with the Index Librorum Expurgandorum (for so hee calleth it) printed at Madrill by Alphonsus Gomezius in the yeere 1584. saying that it containeth things erroneous & heretical, as by name, that it doth not sufficiently expunge & purge the workes of Carolus Molineus, whome hee tearmeth an heretike of the first or highest forme. Thus we may iustly feare that there will never be an end of their clipping & curtolling, when themselves cannot agree what is to be pulled out, but when they have fleeced and plumed the workes of any the most learned man, either of our side or of their owne, some other of these purgers may & must, againe and againe fall vpon the same.
               31 But if heere it be replyed as some Papists amongst vs do already mutter, & as it is probable that Gretzerus will vrge more at large, if he put forth a defence of the Indices Expurgatorij, as I heare that he intendeth, That this clipping and blotting out, is not in the texts of the Fathers, but onely in Prefaces, Marginall notes, Collections out of them, or observations vpon them, or else if it be very textes, it is but out of the works of later writers, I aunswere that these purgings and razings towards the Fathers themselves indeede do not so directly appeere as the other, for in this they vse a singular cunning, obliquely to doe what they possibly may. But I desire to bee informed to what ende these things do bende. First they confesse in their

                  Catholikes meaning the Fathers, we beare many errours, & extenuate them, excuse them, excogitating some devise we many times deny them, and doe faine vnto them a convenient sence, while they are opposed in disputations, or inconflictes with the adversaries. Heere is a

distorting and turning away of the sence of the Fathers, even against their owne consciences. Secondly I finde it reported by Praefat. ad Lector. in Belg. Indic. Ex. purg: Iunius, as a matter which himselfe sawe, that now about forty yeeres since, the workes of S. Ambrose being printed at Lions by Frelonius, there came in two Franciscanes which razed out much of diverse printed sheetes, which enforced Frelonius to new print the same againe, not after the olde Copies, but as the Friers would haue them, to the great charge and trouble of the Printer, as Ludovicus Savarius the correctour of the presse did complaine, professing that he would buy any copy of Ambrose rather then that. It were a good labour for some man who had leisure, to conferre the elder bookes with that edition, & to notifie the differences to the worlde. Thirdly I houlde it the same fraude to adde which it is to diminishe, neither is there any sentence but by interlacing wordes inough, a cunning worke-man may turne it cleane contrary to the sence of the Authour himselfe: And this may be as good an Index Correctorius or Additorius as the other Expurgatorius. Pamelius a Canō of Bruges taketh on him to revise S. Cyprian, & finding that pregnant place, before by me mētioned, De vnitate Ecclesiae Alias de simplicitate praelatorum: 
                  The rest of the Apostles were the same which Peter was, endewed with like fellowshippe both of honour and of power, & other things both before and after it to that purpose, he foisteth into the middle of sentences, for super vnum aedificat Ecclesiam, vpō one he buildeth the Church, thus much, super illum vnum aedificat Ecclesiam suam, & illi Pascendas mandat oves suas: he buildeth his Church vpon that one meaning Peter & committeth his sheepe to him to bee fedde. And againe vnam cathedram constituit, hee erected one chaire, And afterward Qui cathedram Petri super quam fūda est Ecclesia deserit, he who for saketh the chaire of Peter vppon which the Church is founded, doth he hope that he is in the Church? Observat. in Pamelij Annotat. Simon Goulartius who hath displayed the wicked falshood of this forger, besides other evidences against this vilainy, doth cite the wordes of Gratian out of the new editiō of Gregories Decree, which bringeth in the place of Cyprian as we & all other (before Pamelius) did reade it. But a Th Bilsonus Epis cop. Winton. lib. 1. contra Pōtificios. learned man of our Church handling that last place, he who far saketh the chaire of Peter vpon which the Church is built, doth shew that this addition is contrary to all the printed

Copies which were before, as by name of Alopecius at Coleine, Hervagius at Basile, Langelier at Paris, Crinitus at Antwerpe, Griphius at Lions, Manutius at Rome. Yea that besides Erasmus diverse Papists as Rembolius, Canchius, Costerius, Gravius, Manutius, Morelius, had set foorth Cyprian, searching for written copies of the best both farre and neere, & yet no man of all these, in all their editions thinking of any such matter. Lastly that In indiculo c

                     um excusor: & manuscr. in initio Cypr. Pamelius himselfe saying that he had the helpe of eight more manuscript copies besides printed ones, could gather no such thinge in any of all them, but onely out of one Cambron copie, which must checke all the bookes of Christendome. VVhich sheweth that doubtlesse this Cambron broode was forged in former time by some one, who was desirous to magnifie the Primacy of the Pope. Fourthly our makers of the Indices doe goe very neere the Fathers, whē they blotte out of the Tables of their bookes those things which were in the Authours themselves, either word for word or in apparant meaning as before I have manifested. Fifthly it is not to be doubted, but that as there be many things more altered in Cyprian by Pamelius, which Goulartius hath refuted, and may be reade by any man that will, And many matters razed in Ambrose, so if any man had leisure to conferre them, hee should finde the like done in Chrysostome and other of the Fathers (as Vide Th. Bilson. lib. 4 Basile is notably forged to make for Images) some things being added, some diminished, other changed, the tryall whereof it were good some of our men did vndertake in the Gregory lately put out at Rome, or some other such booke. Sixthly who knoweth whether there bee any such Index gathered already, or in gathering, for the writings of all the Fathers, by the which the new editions must be trimmed. VVe see that daily they adde their other Indices, therfore they may adde one of this nature also; And long it was before those could be found, which now are discovered, and so the times of the descrying of this may not be yet come. Or who knoweth whether they who began with the marginal notes, Contents, Arguments, Tables and other Observations vpon the Doctours, & therin did make triall by this gentle sounding at first, how wel they could cary it, or how the world woulde take it, now grow resolute to proceed

farther. Since they are over shooes, best plunge higher even over the shoulders: they see their good will is knowne, and therefore best now be impudent, the ice is broken in Ambrose & Cyprian, & they are no better then their fellowes, who therfore worthily shall all be served with the same sawce. Seventhly, which is not least to bee observed, and sitteth best with my former coniectures, a late country-man of ours from Rome hath givē some prety light to this matter: I meane the Authour of the The warnwoord to S F

                     Ha. stings wast-word. 
                  VVarnewoord. Whether I should say this to be Father Parsons, or Father Warford, I know not well: since Warford as I am certainely informed, hath perpetually free accesse to the others study, & digesteth that matter vvhich Parsons is not at leisure to put into forme, & sometimes putting Epistles & Prefaces to the workes of the elder Foxe, they two play handy-dandy so eche with other, that they thinke by a Iesuitish conveiance, they ioyntly or severally according to the cōveniency of their thē present purposes may affirme or deny any booke to be or not be the worke of Father Parsons. But whether soever of the two it be, he being charged by his adversary with the clipping of the Fathers according to the rules of the Index Expurgatorius, laboureth to avoide from his side the imputation of those fraudes. And for that purpose Encount. 2: cap 9: citeth diverse rules prefixed by the Councel of Trent, before the Index, all which rules do touch the workes of later writers; but touching those which are ancient, he saith that thus they decree, In libris autem Catholicorum veterum, nihil mutari fa
                        •…
                      sit nisi vbi aut fraude haereticorum, aut typographi incuria manifestus error irrepserit. Which he Englisheth thus, It may not be lawfull (for them that correct bookes) to chaunge any thing at all in the bookes of the ancient Catholikes, except where any manifest errour shoulde appeere to have crept in, either by the fraude of heretikes, or negligence of the Printer. Heere then are two cases, in which even the works of the old Fathers may bee altered: And according to this hee affirmeth of the Spanishe Index Expurgatorius: that it is most certaine that in all they put out of any authour before our age, they follow one of two reasons before mentioned, to wit, that either they find it thrust in by heretiks, or by errour of the Printer, & that other more ancient & corrected copies had it not. Now vnder this shamelesse coulour, they in their impudē
                  cy

may do what they list: for since Papistes and Popishe Correctours must be the Iudges, there shal bee nothing which crosseth their Antichristian doctrine, but it by and by shal be saide (even contrary to all antiquity) to be thrust in by heretikes. And what conscience they make in practising their owne rule, and keeping themselves within compasse thereof, may bee seene by that of Cyprian so handled by Pamelius as is before mencioned, where it cannot be denied but that they have altered the wordes from those which formerly were, And shal it now bee saide to bee the Printers faulte, that the words are as we reade them. Why their owne Prints, & all the olde written copies have them so. Or shal it be said to be foisted in by heretikes, when so many & so greate Papists as Costerius, Manutius, Morelius and the other aboue named were, yea Gratian himselfe doth put it as wee doe? The truth then is, they wil put in & put out, adde, diminish, choppe, chaunge & alter what they list, & if any shewe can that way be made it shall be pretended to be the errour of the Printer, or the falshood of an Heretike: but if there be not so much as any coulour for that pretence, yet if it bee for their purpose, it shall bee done, with hope that it shall not bee espied, or that some secrete probable reason shal be imagined wherfore iustly they might do so. In which respect I may say, that the rule is wicked & the practise is worse, the one sl
                     •…
                  y permitteth falshood, the other more audaciously doth execute it, and so even the workes of the most Auncient are daily depraved by this sinfull and deceitfull Romishe broode. So that if ever there were a fraudulent and false generation of vipers on the earth; if men that have solde themselves to falshood; if such as to serve the turne of their vn-holy Father, care not what they doe which may cary any pretence, it is this vngracious and vngodly company. The Lorde discover their wickednesse to the simple people, that every one may see and detest their damnable abuses. By these plaine and evident matters, it may appeere whether the Romanists or we doe truely make more reckoning of the Fathers, since wee yeelde them so much authority as belongeth to auncient, godly, and learned men, noble lampes in the Primitive Church, and great illustratours of the truth; they in substance overthrow all this; since we

conserving them, they corrupt them, and either raze or adde to, or pervert such sentences & sayings of the Doctours, as any way impeach their Romish Hierarchy wherby as vsurpers they raigne and dominere in the consciences of men and women.

            To the Christian Reader.
            
               IT is now about one yeare and a halfe agone, that beeing intreated to aunswere this Pamphlet, which is more fraught with malice and bitter speaking then with truth or learning, in behalfe of my poore countrey-men abused by these Seminarians, I vndertooke it. And albeit for the whole yeere following I was sufficiently burthened with my ordinary businesse, & therein for the space of 9. or 10. weeks, sicke and much weakened with a sharpe and vehement fever: yet my desire to dispell these foggy mists of Popery was such, that within the compasse of that time, I drew vp the first Copy of an Answere to 16. of these Romish Reasons. Wherein rather desiring to giue to the Reader a substantial then a flight satisfaction, I found by probable coniecture that even so much would grow to a reasonable volume: and the like course heere-after being taken with the latter part of D. Hils book, there also might arise a work of like proportion. Vpon this conceit I fell to revising & writing out to the Presse that which formerly I had done, and therein by Gods blessing I went so farre, that now 6. moneths since I finished so much as heere is published, some few interlacings only excepted. But when I shoulde haue proceeded to the perfecting vp of the other sixe, a burthē was by my honorable Patrone imposed vpō me, which togither with my necessary imploimēts at Winchester since that time, hath so put me frō cōtēplatiō & kept me in cōtinual actiō, that I scant haue bin able to sustaine the waight

of the daily cōtingent, & perpetually incūbent busines, as is apparant to every mā acquainted with mine estate. And in as much as yet for a time I'am not like to be freed from that charge, I am put to this difficulty, that either till I haue more leysure; I must stay the Answere to these tenne Chapters, being now completed by the Printer, or I must send these forth without their fellowes, which is much cō
               trary to my former purpose.
            Notwithstanding at the last I haue resolued vpon the latter of these two courses, being the rather inclined thervnto, because a learned man of the other Vnivetsity hath lately vn-quartered the whole Quartron of D. Hils Reasons, which peradventure in the iudgement of many men may seeme so good a satisfaction to that which the adversarie hath obiected, that my future labours in this Argument may very well be spared. For this cause my purpose is, (giving way to my present necessarie services) to attend and expect for a while, the iudgement and Censure of men wise and learned in our Church, and afterwarde to proceede or not proceede as occasion hall require. In the meane time I may say, that the mainest and principallest bulwarkes of the Romish religion are these, which I haue already assaulted: and it is as easie a matter to go forward with the rest, as it hath beene to deale with these. Before persons which are wilfully ignoraunt, or perverse togither with their learning, Popery may bear some shew; but with such as haue the skill to displaye it, or the grace to endure the dismasking of it, it is but a painted Iesabell. Only herein the vnsearchable iudgement of God is to bee admired, and his waies which are past finding out are to be wondered at, and that with amasement and astonishment, that there should yet be so many, who haue eies and see not, &

eares and heare not, yea harts and vnderstand not, but still go forward to make vp the number of the servitors of the beast, and of the traine of Antichrist, who must haue some to adore him till the dissolution of the worlde. But to the ende that such among our Popish Countrey-men as are ordained to salvation, may be plucked out of the fire, it behoveth vs who are the Ministers of the Gospell to be diligent in preaching the Gospell to such as wil heare, and in writing, for such as will reade, that they may know and beleeue and be saved. For the better accomplishing wherof, and for the instruction of the ignorant, who most readylie are seduced, I haue taken these paines, endevouring to deliver plainely and without obscurity that which I haue to saie: And for the cleering of all my Doctors both general and particular suggestions, tracing him step by step, & besides discussing the maine drifte of his Reasons, togither with the validity of those Arguments, which others for the strengthening of the Romane perfidiousnesse, doe or may rest therevpon. And yet in fitting my selfe to the capacity of the vnlearned, I haue not beene altogither forgetful to giue some cōtentment to men of more knowledge, wherin how farre I haue gone, it is not for me, but for others to iudge.
            But whereas I haue once made mention, of the expelling of the Iesuites out of Fraunce, and the sharpe Edict which was there against thē; and now the report is strong, that vpon some cōditions they are restored thither again, (to the truth wherof in particular, I must ingenuously cō
               fesse, that I cannot yet attaine) the difference of time being waighed will easily aunswere for that matter, it beeing certainelie here-tofore one waie, and nowe peradventure another. In respect whereof it is not amisse to know, that

as it was longer agone that the Copy writtē for the Presse was finished, so it is fiue moneths since that the Printer began with this booke, howsoever sometimes this worke hath beene interrupted, one while with the danger of the Pestilence, which of late hath beene so generally spreade, & another while with the publishing of divers other linal tracts, which the present occasion did offer. And this also may serue for Answer to another point, wherin my charity presumed more quietnes in some men amōgst vs, thē thē
               selues are willing to yeeld correspōdence vnto. Nevertheles I trust that this is but a fit, & that time and experience will giue rest to the most vnquiet and restlesse soirits.
            Lastly I earnestly intreate al Romishly affected English men & women, that they be not so ready to harken to Iesuits & Seminary men, as here-tofore they haue bin, & to follow their lures either in spirituall or temporall matters. What they can say for their Idolatry & superstitiō is long since known, neither haue they yet brought ought of moment, but hath received answer. And for their other behaviour, whither it be cōmēdable & Christiā, or no, let their own books between the vnited & dis-vnited Priests shew, wherin of late so copiously & so liuely they haue disciphered each other. But if this will not serue the turne, let the practises of two Priests lately displayed & cōfested by thē
               selues at Winchester, make all men take heede of them. It is hard to say whether their attempts were more traiterous against their Soveraigne, or trecherous against their frends & men of their owne Religion. I take no pleasure to speak ill of those which are dead, & whose bodies have endured the stroke of Iustice according to their deserts. But since these thīgs were not done in a corner, but as matters exēplary to al the land, & they cā no way be concealed, let.

me make the vse of thē, for which 
                  •…
               od ordained thē, that is to warne other mē of that which was disclosed there. Vnder a colour of doing service to our most gracious Soveraigne, Watson drewe on his frēds to horrible attemptes of treasō against their Lord & King. Some of thē telleth, that his Maty, must be assisted against the Puritans, some other, that it must be against the lesuits: whē indeed it was nothing els, but to set the whole kingdome into cōbustiō, to the alteratiō of the state & the effusiō of much bloude, that himself (a base & meane cōpaniō) might be possessed with the greatest office of Englād, & other his complices with the next. It was no marveil that with shame & cōfusiō of face he did hāge down his head, whē his own folowers too propēse before to seditiō & tumults; did personally but most deservedly reproch him for so intrapping thē. Now how were Papists in that actiō lead blindfold, when leaving their own vocatiōs, their houses, wives & childrē, they could be perswaded to daūce after the pipe of Preests putting them into facts of so high
                  •…
                nature, & that in such troups they wold advēture vpō thē? I say in such t
                  •…
               oupes, because the two Priests being returned frō those coūtries where their acquaintance lay, made it knowne to a special person of the cōspiracy, that they had 500. men ready to acte that which they had formerly plotted, and instantly mooved him, that it might expeditely be done. And that this was not altogither vnlikely, is plain by the opē speech of Clarke at the barre, who professed that he could bring two hūdred mē, viz. to acte such their pretended devises for their Catholik cause: & yet Clarke was the lesse active Preest of the two If these felowes in a matter of that high quality spake false (which some will imagine) what trust may their favourites give them, in other their relations?

If they spake true, how feareful is the case of such as listen vnto them, who so soone, & vnder such faire coulours may be circumvented? But how mercifull in the meane time, is the proceeding of his blessed Maiestie, who questioneth not with severity of iustice al those who were intangled in some circumstāces of that attempt (it being no hard matter to have them discovered) but affoordeth much more clemency then other Princes in like cases have done. Let them magnify the mercy of the Lord, and his Annointed, and let them thinke and speake honorably of the Ienity of the State, which rather spareth' men apparantly ill deserving then questioneth any who are tolerably innocent. And for the restlet them seriously take heede of such as have beene nouzeled vnder Cardinal Allen, Persons, Barret, Worthington and their adherents, least they temporally bring ruine on their houses and bodies, and eternally on their soules. God wil not evermore beare those, who shut their eies and stop their eares against the truth. The Lord direct vs in his owne waies, & call home such as wilfully or by ignorance have gone astray, that at lēgth they may bee reduced to the sheepe-folde of Christ Iesus, to whom with his Father, and their blessed spirite bee praise for evermore,
            Amen.
