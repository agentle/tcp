                  TO THE HONORABLE
Gentleman, and my very good Maister, Sir
Henry Fanshawe, KNIGHT.
                  
                     WOrthy Sir: among many Patrons of Art, and Musicall endeuours,
I am emboldened to rancke your Name; who, as
I know you not inferiour to the best, as well for a louer of
MVSICKE, as a competent Iudge of that Noble facultie;
so I present you here, with such numbers best fitting
your innated Harmony, and (I hope) not vnworthy your
Patronage. And though I know the excellent varietie
of these Compositions, hath fed time with fulnesse, and
bred many Censors, more curious, then (perhaps) Iudiciall; and since no Science
carries so sufficient authority in it selfe, but must needs submit to that Monster
OPINION, halfe truth, halfe falshood; yet these of mine being thus fronted
with your Countenance, digested by your Eare, and allowed in your Knowledge;
should they proue distastfull with the queasie pallated, or surfeited delight, yet
with the sound (vnsubiect to such disease of Humor, and appetite) I presume
they will pleasingly rellish, and (with your equall selfe) mainteine me against
the corrupted number of Time-sicke humorists. These (honoured SYR) are the
primitiae of my Muse, planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by the gentle calme
of your Fauour; what I may produce hereafter is wholy Yours (as who hath
more right to the Fruit then he that owneth the Stock?) If then you accept (in
stead of reall worth) this my humble Tribute of Affection, I shall study to vse
that grace, with my time, to the best aduantage, and till I may better deserue
you, in my vtmost abilities euer rest
                  
                     Your Worships in all seruiceable
endeuour and deuotion

                     WOrthy Sir: among many Patrons of Art, and Musicall en-
deuours, I am emboldened to rancke your Name; who, as
I know you not inferiour to the best, as well for a louer of
MVSICKE, as a competent Iudge of that Noble faculties
so I present you here, with such numbers best fitting
your innated Harmony, and (I hope) not vnworthy your
Patronage. And though I know the excellent varietie
of these Compositions, hath fed time with fulnesse, and
bred many Censors, more curious, then (perhaps) Iudiciall; and since no Science
carries so sufficient authority in it selfe, but must needs submit to that Monster
OPINION, halfe truth, halfe falshood; yet these of mine being thus fronted
with your countenance, digested by your Eare, and allowed in your Knowledge;
should they proue distastfull with the queasie-pallated, or surfeited delight, yet
with the sound (vnsubiect to such disease of Humor, and appetite) I presume
they will pleasingly rellish, and (with your equall selfe) mainteine me against
the corrupted number of Time-sicke humorists. These (honoured SYR) are the
primitiae of my Muse, planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by the gentle calme
of your Fauour; what I may produce hereafter is wholy Yours (as who hath
more right to the Fruit then he that owneth the Stock?) If then you accept (in
stead of reall worth) this my humble Tribute of Affection, I shall study to vse
that grace, with my time, to the best aduantage, and till I may better des erue
you, in my vtmost abilities euer rest

                     WOrthy Sir: among many Patrons of Art, and Musicall endeuours,
I am emboldened to rancke your Name; who, as
I know you not inferiour to the best as well for a louer of
MVSICKE, as a competent Iudge of that Noble facultie;
so I present you here, with such numbers best fitting
your innated Harmony, and (I hope) not vnworthy your
Patronage. And though I know the excellent varietie
of these Compositions, hath fed time with fulnesse, and
bred many Censors, more curious, then (perhaps) Iudiciall; and since no Science
carries so sufficient authority in it selfe, but must needs submit to that Monster
OPINION, halfe truth, halfe falshood; yet these of mine being thus fronted
with your Countenance, digested by your Eare, and allowed in your Knowledge;
should they proue distastfull with the queasie-pallated, or surfeited delight, yet
with the sound (vnsubiect to such disease of Humor, and appetite) I presume
they will pleasingly rellish, and (with your equall selfe) mainteine me against
the corrupted number of Time-sicke humorists. These (honoured SYR) are the
primitiae of my Muse, planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by the gentle calme
of your Fauour; what I may produce hereafter is wholy Yours (as who hath
more right to the Fruit then he that owneth the Stock?) If then you accept (in
stead of reall worth) this my humble Tribute of Affection, I shall study to vse
that grace, with my time, to the best aduantage, and till I may better deserue
you, in my vtmost abilities euer rest

                     WOrthy Sir: among many Patrons of Art, and Musicall endeuours,
I am emboldened to rancke your Name; who, as
I know you not inferiour to the best, as well for a louer of
MVSICKE, as a competent Iudge of that Noble facultie;
so I present you here, with such numbers best fitting
your innated Harmony, and (I hope) not vnworthy your
Patronage. And though I know the excellent varietie
of these Compositions, hath fed time with fulnesse, and
bred many Censors, more curious, then (perhaps) Iudiciall; and since no Science
carries so sufficient authority in it selfe, but must needs submit to that Monster
OPINION, halfe truth, halfe falshood; yet these of mine being thus fronted
with your Countenance, digested by your Eare, and allowed in your Knowledge;
should they proue distastfull with the queasie-pallated, or surfeited delight, yet
with the sound (vnsubiect to such disease of Humor, and appetite) I presume
they will pleasingly rellish, and (with your equall selfe) mainteine me against
the corrupted number of Time-sicke humorists. These (honoured SYR) are the
primitiae of my Muse, planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by the gentle calme
of your Fauour; what I may produce hereafter is wholy Yours (as who hath
more right to the Fruit then he that owneth the Stock?) If then you accept (in
stead of reall worth) this my humble Tribute of Affection, I shall study to vse
that grace, with my time, to the best aduantage, and till I may better deserue
you, in my vtmost abilities euer rest

                  TO THE HONORABLE
Gentleman, and my very good Maister, Sir
Henry Fanshawe, KNIGHT.
                  
                     WOrthy Sir: among many Patrons of Art, and Musicall endeuours,
I am emboldened to rancke your Name; who, as
I know you not inferiour to the best, as well for a louer of
MVSICKE, as a competent Iudge of that Noble facultie;
so I present you here, with such numbers best fitting
your innated Harmony, and (I hope) not vnworthy your
Patronage. And though I know the excellent varietie
of these Compositions, hath fed time with fulnesse, and
bred many Censors, more curious, then (perhaps) Iudiciall; and since no Science
carries so sufficient authority in it selfe, but must needs submit to that Monster
OPINION, halfe truth, halfe falshood; yet these of mine being thus fronted
with your Countenance, digested by your Eare, and allowed in your Knowledge;
should they proue distastfull with the queasie-pallated, or surfeited delight, yet
with the sound (vnsubiect to such disease of Humor, and appetite) I presume
they will pleasingly rellish, and (with your equall selfe) mainteine me against
the corrupted number of Time-sicke humorists. These (honoured SYR) are the
primitiae of my Muse, planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by the gentle calme
of your Fauour; what I may produce hereafter is wholy Yours (as who hath
more right to the Fruit then he that owneth the Stock?) If then you accept (in
stead of reall worth) this my humble Tribute of Affection, I shall study to vse
that grace, with my time, to the best aduantage, and till I may better deserue
you, in my vtmost abilities euer rest
                  
                     Your Worships in all seruiceable
endeuour and deuotion

                     WOrthy Sir: among many Patrons of Art, and Musicall endeuours,
I am emboldened to rancke your Name; who, as
I know you not inferiour to the best, as well for a louer of
MVSICKE, as a competent Iudge of that Noble facultie;
so I present you here, with such numbers best fitting
your innated Harmony, and (I hope) not vnworthy your
Patronage. And though I know the excellent varietie
of these Compositions, hath fed time with fulnesse, and
bred many Censors, more curious, then (perhaps) Iudiciall; and since no Science
carries so sufficient authority in it selfe, but must needs submit to that Monster
OPINION, halfe truth, halfe falshood; yet these of mine being thus fronted
with your Countenance, digested by your Eare, and allowed in your Knowledge;
should they proue distastfull with the queasie-pallated, or surfeited delight, yet
with the sound (vnsubiect to such disease of Humor, and appetite) I presume
they will pleasingly rellish, and (with your equall selfe) mainteine me against
the corrupted number of Time-sicke humorists. These (honoured SYR) are the
primitiae of my Muse, planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by the gentle calme
of your Fauour; what I may produce hereafter is wholy Yours (as who hath
more right to the Fruit then he that owneth the Stock?) If then you accept (in
stead of reall worth) this my humble Tribute of Affection, I shall study to vse
that grace, with my time, to the best aduantage, and till I may better deserue
you, in my vtmost abilities euer rest
                  
                     Your Worships in all seruiceable
endeuour and deuotion
