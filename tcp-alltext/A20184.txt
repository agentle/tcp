HAND-MAID
OF REPENTANCE.
OR,
A SHORT TREATISE
OF RESTITVTION.
            Written by ARTH: DENT, Miniſter
of Gods word at Southſhoobery
in ESSEX.
            As a neceſſary Appendix to his Sermon
of Repentance.
            
            Printed for Thomas Thorp.
1614.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE CHRIſtian
Reader.
            
               THE zealous care
of that religious
and learned Teacher
Mr. Dent, towardes
the edification
of Gods houſe, in the exhortation
of his people vnto holineſſe
of life; as it hath ſufficiently
approued it ſelfe to the generall
view of the World in diuers
worthy workes of his now
extant: ſo by the conſent of many

deuout and iudicious Chriſtians,
it hath not in any one peece
or other of his doing, more fully
aud truly expreſſed it ſelfe; than
in that Sermon which himſelfe
firſt preached, and afterwardes
cauſed to be publiſhed, vpon Repentance.
It might haue been ſuppoſed,
that this delicate Age of
ours would ſcarcely haue put on
ſo rough a garment. But the vertuous
cunning of that excellent
Artiſt, had ſo thicke ouerlaced
the ſame with heauenly promiſes
and comfortable perſwaſions:
that although at the firſt aſſaying
thereof, it found it ſelfe
inwardly prickt and perturbed;
yet after a little wearing, and by

daily vſe, the ſtraightneſſe thereof
became both profitable and
pleaſing, and it reioyced not a
little to be ſo happily deceiued.
Behold heere another peece of
Worke, made by the ſame hand,
A ſhort Treatiſe of Reſtitution:
Array thy ſelfe likewiſe (good
Christian) with this Veſture; being
indeed an Ornament, which
will make the reſt of thy cloathing
appeare more gracious.
This is the true Touch-ſtone
which tries thy repentance; and
giues thee to God and the world
either a true Chriſtian, or a counfeit.
Be not afraid to vſe it: but
as thou haſt vouchſafed the former,
of Repentance, to weare in

thine heart, and haſt thereby no
doubt (if thou be a Chriſtian) receiued
great conſolation; ſo let
this latter, of Restitution, be as a
Poſie in thine hand, to thy more
aſſured & greater comfort. This
is the furniture which renders
the gueſt acceptable at the heauenly
marriage. If then thou
deſireſt to bee welcome to that
Feaſt, enter thus ſuited. Now foraſmuch
as this ſo neceſſary and
Chriſtianlike a worke, penned by
ſo ſinguler a Miniſter of the Goſpell,
and ſo much conducting to
eternall bliſſe, hath by Gods
goodnes come vnto my hands:
and conſidering that Repentance
is of ſmall force where Reſtitution
               
is wanting, as being the onely
Key which openeth the way
vnto Remiſsion; I held my ſelfe
bound in Chriſtian Charity, to
communicate the ſame vnto my
Brethren. Such Talents muſt
not be hid, but put to vſury, that
they may be increaſt with profit.
Praiſe God for the Author of ſo
good a worke; and vſe it to the
rectifying of thine owne conſcience,
that God may be glorified;
which is the accompliſhment of
my deſire. Farewell in the Lord.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            A TREATISE OF
RESTITVTION.
            
               Matter.
               
                  THe matter ſubiect of
Reſtitution is thréefold:
the firſt, ſatiſfaction
for things taken
from the Owner: the
ſecond, of damage ſuſtained;
the third, of
iniuries offered. In all theſe Caſes, a
carefull Chriſtian ought to make Reſtitution,
in manner and forme as héereafter
followeth: theſe circumſtances conſidered.
            
            
               
               Circumſtances.
               Who, and to whom,
               what, and how much,
               Where, when, and how,
               thou ſhould'ſt reſtore,
               Conſider well:
               this will thee teach
               A Leſſon good,
               for rich and poore.
            
            
               Manner.
               Touching the firſt part of matter taken,
we muſt vnderſtand, That thinges
be taken from the owner two wayes: viz.
either violently, or voluntarily: as by rapine,
theft, &c. voluntarily, as when a
man borrowing any thing, receiueth it at
the owners hands. As the taking the one,
is iniurious: ſo the detaining of the other,
is malicious.
               Hauing thus bréefely ſpoken of the matter,
wherein Reſtitution is to be made:
let vs now procéede to entreat of the circumſtances,

and that moſt bréefely, in order,
thus.
            
            
               Perſons who.
               Euery one is bound to make Reſtitution,
who hath béene the cauſe of wrongfull
taking: and where the perſons are many,
euery one ought to reſtore.
               Ten waies may a man be the cauſe of
wrongfull taking another mans goods,
for which he is to make reſtitution.
               
                  1
                  He muſt reſtore
                  that others goods doth take;
                  As he alſo
                  that ſubſtitute doth make.
                  The Vſurer,
                  his Seruant ſends for bands,
                  To wound a man,
                  another he commands.
                  The Maiſters heere
                  the Seruants doe compell,
                  
                     
Not to obey,
                  as much as to rebell.
                  Therefore in theſe,
                  the Maiſter is to blame
                  For Seruants faults;
                  amends then make for ſhame.
               
               
                  2
                  Or doth approue
                  what in his name was done,
                  He muſt reſtore;
                  and not the time prolong:
                  Of raſh attempts,
                  Repentance followes ſoone.
               
               
                  3
                  Ill counſell oft
                  moues many one to ill:
                  Therefore beware;
                  to counſaile is to kill.
               
               
                  4
                  Conſent, as cauſe,
                  in miſchiefe muſt be taken:
                  
                     
Therefore 'tis good,
                  ill counſaile were forſaken.
               
               
                  5
                  Beware of praiſe:
                  commend not one in ſinne▪
                  
                  One miſcheefe done,
                  another doth begin.
               
               
                  6
                  Hee that in ill
                  with others hath a ſhare;
                  To make amends,
                  in conſcience muſt prepare.
               
               
                  7
                  He that receiues,
                  from theft will not refraine,
               
               
                  8
                  Stolne goods conceal'd,
                  embolden Theeues againe.
               
               
                  
                  9
                  Not to reſiſt,
                  or ſtay a bad intent
               
               
                  10
                  Is iudg'd as much,
                  as for to giue conſent.
               
            
            
               Perſons to whom Reſtitution
is to be made.
               If the thing taken or with-holden, bée
any mans proper goods only; then it muſt
bee reſtored to the right owner. But in
caſe a publike perſon, either Ciuill or Eccleſiaſticall,
waſt or make ſpoile of things
belonging to their place: Reſtitution muſt
bee made vnto the place, whereunto the
matter belongeth.
               If the owner be not knowne, or if one
cannot haue frée and ſafe acceſſe vnto
him: then it ought to bee giuen vnto the
poore.
               
                  
If a man be bound to make reſtitution
for thinges vniuſtly taken, as in vſury:
Reſtitution ought to be made to the party
damnified. So that theſe two thinges concurre;
vniuſt taking, and dammage enſuing
thervpon. In ſo much that he which
ſtealeth a pawne from a Marchant-man,
ought to reſtore it to the Marchant: notwithſtanding,
in the Court of Conſcience
he might reſtore it to the owner; ſo as the
Marchant were not thereby damnified.
            
            
               Owners dead.
               If the perſon, to whom Reſtitution
ought to be made be dead: it ſhall be giuen
to his heires.
            
            
               Vnknowne.
               If the perſon, from whom any thing
hath béene ſtolne, bee not knowne, after
that a man hath done his endeuour by diligent
inquiry: then the thing ſhall be giuen
to Chriſt in his poore members,Our times cannot like ſuch curioſity. as
Lord of the whole world.
               If the owner be farre diſtant, and the

thing with-holden, may eaſily and faithfully
be ſent vnto him: if the matter be of
great valew, it ought to be ſent vnto the
owner, at the coſts and charges of the
wrongfull detainer: if it cannot bee ſent
vnto him, and the matter be of ſmall account,
it may be giuen to his Kinsfolke,
or to the vſe of ſome Hoſpitall, at the diſcretion
of ſome honeſt perſon; with this
Prouiſo, that when the owner commeth,
it ſhall be reſtored vnto him.
            
            
               Vſurers.
               If an Vſurer be in conſcience mooued,
to reſtore the mony taken by Vſury; and
the parties, to whom Reſtitution ought
to be made, bee remooued from the place
where the Vſurer dwelleth: then the
Mony may be returned at their own charges;
Too good to be true. but if the Vſurer remooue, then at
his charges.
            
            
               Mad men.
               The owners ought not alwaies to haue
their owne reſtored: namely, when it

might turne to their owne harme; as a
a ſword taken from a mad man: but it
may be reſerued for his heires.
            
            
               Diſhoneſt.
               Things taken vpon vnhoneſt conditions,
neede not to be reſtored, vnleſſe they
bee gotten by craft or violence; or taken
from him, that hath no right to alienate
them.
            
            
               Game.
               Thinges gotten by Game, are of like
nature: yet in both, the parties may bee
counſailed to giue them to the poore.
            
            
               Things found.
               Things found, which neuer had owner,
or who neuer was knowne in the memory
of man, or that eares not for them; are
his that findes them.
            
            
               
               Treaſure.
               Concerning Treaſure, the right owner
whereof is not knowne: if a man finde it
in his owne ground, it is the finders: if it
bee found in another mans ground, halfe
of it is the owners of the ground; the other
halfe is his that found it.
               If treaſure bee found in another mans
ground, by diligent ſearch, with conſent
or licence of him that owes the ground;
it is his that findes it, becauſe the other
will not ſeeke it. If a man ſeeke for treaſure,
againſt the will, or without the licence
of him that owes the ground: it
wholy belongs to the owner of the
ground.
               If a man know there is treaſure in another
mans ground, and buy the ground:
it ſéemeth, that the treaſure is the buyers.
As for thoſe Cuſtomes and lawes, wherby
treaſure found belongeth to the Prince;Note.
I purpoſe not to meddle, neither doe I
ſpeake any thing in this whole diſcourſe
that is preiudiciall to the Lawes. Let the

learned Lawyers diſcuſſe ſuch caſes. Yet
Lawes grounded vpon reaſon, ought in
conſcience to be regarded.
            
            
               What a man muſt reſtore.
               Thinges in their property and kind, as
alſo damages, are to be reſtored.
               If the thing it ſelfe be to be had, let it be
reſtored, vnleſſe the
feare of ſcandall or
other danger ſhould
enſue:In this caſe men muſt beware, that they become not Fellons of their own goods; eſpecially, if after his goods bee taken hee haue made any purſuit, by raiſing hue & cry: otherwiſe, the matter being ſecret betwixt the taker and the owner; a man may without danger receiue his own againe, as ſome think. Lamb.
                   then may the
worth thereof be reſtored,
at the diſcretion
of ſome honeſt
perſon. If the thing
it ſelfe cānot be had,
or bee made worſe,
the like may bee reſtored.
               Whoſoeuer hath
another mans good,
is bound to reſtore
it; whether he haue
it by good meanes
or otherwiſe.
            
            
               
               Things bought bonâ fide.
               If a man buy an Horſe, thinking it to
be his that ſels him,Our lawes are otherwiſe, grounded on this: Rather a miſcheeſe, than an inconuenience. and is not: if he ſhal
afterward ſell the
Horſe to another; he
is bound to reſtore
the gaine, & no more.
            
            
               Giuen.
               If a ſtolne Horſe be giuen a man, and he
afterwards ſell him:Note. he ought to reſtore
the price fully: if he kéepe him, hee is
bound to reſtore him without any price to
the owner. Yet hee may haue action againſt
the ſeller howſoeuer.
            
            
               Malâ fide.
               If a man buy ought by euill meanes,
vpon a gréedy intent of gaine: he is bound
to giue the thing, if hee haue it; or the valew,
if he haue it not, together with the
gaines he hath got thereby. And although

it be ſtolne from him; yet is he not frée frō
Reſtitution.
            
            
               Goods preſerued.
               A man, taking the goods of another, only
with intent to ſaue it from ſpoile or periſhing;
may lawfully demaund his expences.
            
            
               Of hindrances.
               If one violently or vnlawfully ſtay or
hinder another from obtaining of any commodity,
he is chargeable with the dammage.
               A man, letting another from the lawfull
diſpatch of his honeſt buſineſſe, or duty;
is bound to make amends, at the diſcretion
of ſome honeſt perſon.
            
            
               Creditors.
               He that hindreth a Creditor by vnlawfull
meanes (that he cannot demaund his
debt of the debter) by deliuering him out
of priſon, by reſcue, or other vnlawfull
meanes: and generally, hee that is
cauſe of damage to another (eſpecially

of ſet purpoſe) if the damage be certaine,
is liable to all; if vncertaine, as an honeſt
man ſhall award.
            
            
               Goods periſhing in another mans
hands.
               If another mans goods periſh in his
handes, through whoſe default they are
not reſtored to the Owner, if the goods
ſhould neuertheleſſe haue periſhed in the
owners handes; in this caſe hee is not
bound to make ſatiſfaction.
               But it is otherwiſe, if the Goods remaining
with the owner had not periſhed:
or if the owner was about to ſell them before;
or otherwiſe, to conuert them to his
owne benefit and commodity.
            
            
               A man flying from his owne
goods.
               If a man through pouerty depart or fly
his owne houſe, and from his goods: hee
is bound in conſcience to reſtore, and ſatiſfie

for his debts, when he comes to better
ſtate, and ſhall be able.
            
            
               Life, Limbes, &c.
               In thoſe damages that enſue vpon a
mans death, wounding, hurting, impriſoning,
defaming, &c. Reſtitution is to be
made at the diſcretion of honeſt perſons;
and according to the power and ability of
the party.
               Who ſo defloureth a maiden, either by
ſeducing or by violence, is bound either to
marry her, or to make her amends at the
diſcretion of ſome honeſt perſon. If hee
promiſed to marry her, he is bound to doe
it, vnleſſe ſome great ſcandall or ſlander
ſhould follow therevpon. But in caſe ſhee
will not marry him, or her Father be vnwilling;
then he ſhall ſatifie her, as ſome
honeſt man ſhall award: but if ſhee was
willing to the fact, he is frée from both.
            
            
               How much ought to be reſtored.
               If the quantity of the matter taken, or of

damage ſuſtained, be certain; he is bound
to ſatiſfie as much: if it be vncertaine, as
in iniuries and wrongs, then as much as
an honeſt perſon ſhall appoint, according
to the circumſtances of the offence, &c.
               He that poſſeſſeth any thing that is anothers,
whereby he is enriched, ought to
reſtore it wholly, and the increaſe thereof:
deducting out his expences, for getting,
kéeping, and preſeruing the ſame, and
fruits thereof.
            
            
               Legacies.
               The reaſon of him that payeth not Legacies
due many yeares before: who
ought to make reſtitution for the commodities
detained.
            
            
               Where Reſtitution is to be
made.
               If Reſtitution bee neceſſary for ought
vnlawfully taken from another: reſtitution
muſt be made, where the owner may
be kept indemnified; if otherwiſe, where

the thing was had.
            
            
               Of the time of Reſtitution.
               A man hauing ought that is anothers,Note 
                        •
                      well. is bound forthwith to make Reſtitution.
Touching this word (forthwith) vnderſtand
it thus, That a man be fully reſolued,
and purpoſe, to reſtore as ſoone as
conueniently he can. As concerning the
performance of his purpoſe, and the effecting
of his intent, Hee ought to doe it in
time conuenient; due circumſtances conſidered.
               Thrée things may excuſe a man, from
making preſent reſtitution.
               
                  1
                  Firſt, the will of the owner granting
delay.
               
               
                  2
                  Secondly, ignorance of the reaſonableneſſe
of right, or of the fact.
               
               
                  
                  3
                  Thirdly, want of ability. Touching
which point, the opinion of the learned riſeth
vpon ſixe concluſions.
               
               
                  1
                  The firſt is, That a man may in extreame
neceſſity, not hauing any thing,
but only things neceſſary for his own life,
and his, is not bound to make preſent reſtitution:
becauſe at that time all things
are common.
               
               
                  2
                  The ſecond is; He that by making Reſtitution
could not liue, according as becommeth
his eſtate, although the owner
not being in the like or greater neceſſity,
will not grant time: yet is he not bound
to make preſent Reſtitution. Notwithſtanding,
hee ought to beware, that hée
make no néedleſſe expences: otherwiſe in
reaſon he could not be excuſed.
               
               
                  
                  3
                  The third is, when reſtitution ſhould
turne to the owners harme, either in reſpect
of his body, or his ſoule, if reſtitution
were made: he ought not preſently to doe
it.
               
               
                  4
                  The fourth is, if the ſame ſhould tend
to a publike danger, or were againſt a
publike commoditie.
               
               
                  5
                  The fifth is, if it were likely to turne to
the loſſe of the Reſtorers good name, the
danger of his life or ſoule, or if thereupon
ſhould follow ſome grieuous ſinne:
preſent reſtitution ought not to be made,
becauſe theſe are greater damages.
               
               
                  6
                  The ſixt is, if preſent reſtitution ſhould

more hurt the debtor, than profit the Creditor.
As if an Artificer, beeing in debt,
ſhould ſell his tooles or inſtruments of his
occupation, whereby he getteth his liuing:
in this caſe he ought not to make preſent
reſtitution; becauſe in reaſon he ought to
haue time giuen him. It ſhould be otherwiſe
if the Creditor were in like ſtate:Note. becauſe
no man ought to hurt another for
his owne benefit. It is otherwiſe where
a man deferreth to reſtore, onely for lucre
ſake, and not vpon neceſſity. Note alſo,
that if delay ſhould be hurtfull to the Creditor:
although a man ſhould auoide the
great
                        •
                     r loſſe in his proper goods; yet at
the leaſt, the Debtor muſt kéepe him loſſeleſſe.
               
            
            
               What order and manner is to be kept
in making Reſtitution.
               He that is able, ought to make reſtitution
to all, without reſpect of order, or delay
of time.
               Hee that cannot reſtore to all, let him
firſt reſtore things certaine before vncertaine.
               
                  
Amongſt things certaine, let thoſe firſt
be reſtored which are in their owne kinde,
and another mans; as goods committed to
kéepe, and things bought and not paid for:
then, other goods in order, as the Lawes
and Statutes doe appoint. If it be not againſt
the Law of Nature: and in caſe
there bee ſundry and manifold opinions;
the ſafeſt is to be followed.
            
            
               Takers of Mony vpon vſe.
               He that hath taken Mony vpon Vſury,
if hee haue not ſo much goods as to ſatiſfie
for other lawfull contracts, and the Vſurer
too; is bound firſt to ſatiſfie for his
lawfull Contracts, with theſe two conditions:
the firſt, That the things taken to
vſe, be not in their proper kind, as pawns
(for theſe ought to be reſtored to the owners
paying the Money;) the ſecond, if
by ſuch Contracts the party was not
made poorer, to pay his former vſury: as
in the promiſe of a dowry it might befall,
whereby hs might become poorer. In this
and the like caſes, lawful Contracts muſt
giue place.
            
            
               
               Vncertaine goods.
               If the goods to be reſtored be vncertain:
then godly counſaile and honeſt aduiſe
muſt direct, euermore prouided, that
men, in great diſtreſſe pitied, bee not by
ſufferance emboldened to bad attemps.
            
            
               Secret things.
               Things ſecretly taken to vſe, ought
carefully to bee reſtored, that the parties
honeſt reputation and good name be not
hurt: but publike vſurie ought publikely
to be reſtored, for by reſtitution a good
name is recouered.
            
            
               Good fame and name.
               If one defame another by iuſt courſe of
Law, there no Reſtitution lieth: but if he
doe it vniuſtly and vntruly, let him make
amends, by acknowledging that he ſpake
vntruly, or concealed the truth. Whe
                     •…
                  
words repeated may doe more harme then
good, there ought to be none acknowledgement.
               
                  
If a mans good name cannot bee recouered,
reſtitution is to be made ſome
other way: and the damage that hath
enſued vpon defamation, ought to bee
ſatiſfied; at the diſcretion of ſome honeſt
perſon. The like may bee ſaid of
ſlanderous libels: and the reſtitution
ought to bee made there, where the
ſlander was raiſed, whether publikely
or priuately, &c.
               If thou findeſt any thing belonging
to an other man, and makeſt not reſtitution
thereof vnto him: the very withholding
is meere rapine. For herein
thou haſt performed thy vttermoſt; and
haſt not done more, becauſe thou couldeſt
not. To deny a man that which is
his owne, is all one as if thou hadſt taken
it from him.
               If thou confeſſe thy ſelfe an offender,
in taking and detaining an other
mans goods, and thereof outwardly repent
thee: yet if, hauing it in thy power
to make reſtitution, thou ſtill detaine
them; thy repentance, howſoeuer thou
makeſt ſhew thereof, is not true, but

fained. But without true repentance
there is no remiſſion: and his repentance
is good indeede, which reſtores
the cauſe therof to the right owners; alwaies
prouided that the Penitent haue
the abilitie to performe it.
               Many account it no ſinne at all, to
detaine an other mans goods if they
chance to finde them: vpon this ground,
That GOD hath ſent them; and
therefore to whome ſhould they reſtore
them? But let ſuch men know, That
it is a ſinne not much differing from
theft, to withhold from the Owner euen
that which they finde.
               He is bound to reſtore the damage, that
another ſuſtaineth, which being therevnto
obliged by his office or place, doth not hinder
the ſame; as is the caſe of a Iudge, a
Father, or Tutor: except the hazard of his
own affaires, which he ought to prefer before
other mens, be the cauſe of his omiſſion.
But he that hereunto is not tyed by his
office, is free from ſuch obligation.
               A witnes being lawfully examined, and

concealing the truth, or not ſpeaking the
whole truth, is bound to ſatiſfie the damage
ſuſtained by reaſon of ſuch his concealement
or ſilence.
               He that fraudulently occupieth another
mans ground, is bound to ſatiſfie for the
fruits receiued, which otherwiſe the Owner
himſelfe might haue gathered, deducting
onely his neceſſarie expences, and
conſideration of his paines, taken, and beſtowed
vpon it. But the caſe is otherwiſe,
in profit ariſing by vſe of another mans
mony: for Reſtitution thereof is not to be
made, vnles it may appeare that the Owner
himſelfe could haue gotten ſo much
by it.
               He that makes a lawfull promiſe, and
doth not performe it; ought to ſatiſfie for
Damage, following vpon the breach
of it.
               He that taketh any reward to doe euill,
if he haue not done it, ought to make Reſtitution;
but if it be committed, hee is at liberty:
howbeit S. Auguſtine be of opinion
in his 54. Epiſtle: That an Aduocate is

bound to reſtore his Fee taken, for the defence
of a bad matter.
               He that hindreth another in the frée donation
or collation of a Benefice, ſo it bee
done without violence and fraud; is not
bound at all to ſatiſfie for it; becauſe as yet
no right of title thereunto is gotten: Likewiſe
he that procureth a will to be altered,
and that with a crafty intention; yet becauſe
there is no ſetled right thereof, as being
in the power of the teſtator to change
it; the partie ſo doing néedeth not to make
any ſatiſfaction: according to ſundry mens
opinions.
               But others there are of a contrarie
iudgement, affirming, That ſuch men are
worthily bound to make Reſtitution, becauſe
they offend againſt the rule of Iuſtice.
               Things committed contrarie to Charitie,
yet according to Iuſtice; require neither
Reſtitution nor Satiſfaction.
               Where two men haue hurt one another
alike: where two parties haue defamed

each other: there is no ſatisfaction to bee
awarded.
               The ſea-faring man is not bound to reſtore
thoſe things, that hee caſteth into the
Sea; which being kept aboord might bee
loſt notwithſtanding, and bee occaſion of
the loſſe both of ſhip and paſſengers.
               Neither is he bound to make Reſtitution;
who after long and diligent ſearch for
his Creditor, and not finding him, diſtributeth
his Debt among the poore: if it be
done by authoritie of a Iudge, and not of
too great moment.
               The heire of an executed murderer, is
bound to reſtore the damage ſuſtained by
the heire of the murdred; yea although the
partie damnified be not vrgent.
               Debt kept back from a ſpend thrift, and
reſerued either to help him in his extremitie,
or to the vſe of his heires, is not of neceſſitie
to be paid vnto the Prodigal. Some
there are notwithſtanding of a contrarie
opinion, that poſitiuely hold, That it
ought to be reſtored vnto him; and in like

caſe to any other, howſoeuer they abuſe
their owne: as long as his or their neighbour
be not wronged by it.
               He that hath any thing in cuſtody which
is ſtollen from a thiefe, ought to reſtore it
to the right Owner; vnleſſe the feare of
death reſtraine him.
               So much is to be reſtored, as is receiued.
For Reſtitution maketh an euenneſſe.
               Stolne goods bought with an euill conſcience,
ought to be reſtored: yea although
by Law the ſale may be iuſtified.
               It is not lawfull to detaine any thing
from the Owner, any longer, than till we
finde opportunitie to reſtore it.
               Of three the moſt eſpeciall degrees
of repentance, this of Reſtitution is
the moſt ſupreme: like as in the three
Theologicall vertues, Charitie obtaineth
the higheſt place. And this dignitie
is principally attributed vnto them

aboue the reſt of their aſſociates, in reſpect
of the end.
               For as Faith without Charitie is
dead: ſo Repentance without Reſtitution
is a vapour; neither of them conducing
to the propoſed end. Suffer not
thy ſelfe therefore to bee carried away,
either by thine owne frailtie, or the
ſuggeſtion of Sathan, from performing
this moſt neceſſarie and Chriſtian dutie.
For indeede, as Charitie demonſtrates
Faith: ſo Reſtitution makes
Charitie perfect. And how can hee
thinke to bee at peace with GOD, that
makes no ſatiſfaction for wrong doing?
Such mens ſorrow for their ſinne is all
one with that of Cains, who in the
guilt of his conſcience confeſſing his offence,
made it (collaterally) his requeſt,
That no man might kill him. This corporall
death is it which they feare: the
ſpirituall death they reſpect not. Verily
I am perſwaded, That with ſuch
men, the old heathen Sillius is of far more
credit than any of the holy Writers either
of the old or new Teſtament. His opinion
was, that by denying God and his

power hee thriued the better. And can we
iudge otherwiſe of this generation, that
make iniquitie their practiſe, and ſeate
themſelues in the chaire of Scorners?
God ſend them better mindes, if they
be not already deliuered ouer into reprobate
ſenſe, that they may cry God mercie,
and obtaine it, by rendring to euery
man that which is his owne. With ſuch
ſacrifice God is pleaſed, better then with
the fat of bullockes. But now briefely to
conclude: as I firſt intended no long diſcourſe,
ſo I will make a ſhort end.
            
         
         
            
            The Concluſion.
            
               GEnerally in all caſes,
where the ſtate, perſon
or fame of any
man ſuffereth detriment
or loſſe, there ought the
partie delinquent to make Reſtitution.
But in theſe daies, Detention
of other mens goods
hath got ſuch an habit amongſt
the moſt ſort of people, through
the long vſe and practiſe of it:
that it is not onely reputed no
ſinne at all; but euen thoſe few,
whom Gods holy Spirit toucheth

with a true feeling of their
offences in this kinde, and thereby
moueth them to make this holy
and religious ſatisfaction, are
by thoſe that would ſeeme wiſe
in this point, accounted meere
fooles and of too ſcrupulous a
conſcience. Hence oftentimes it
commeth to paſſe, that not onely
themſelues runne headlong on in
their wicked courſes; but others
alſo by their meanes are drawne
to the ſame vngodlineſſe. Amongſt
the reſt of many friuolous
excuſes, which carnall men
are wont to alleadge againſt this
ſpirituall counſell of Restitution;
there is a politicke ſhame or diſgrace
pretended, which of neceſſitie

muſt light vpon the partie
reſtoring.
            Now to auoide this ſhame,
which puts ſinne to flight, and auaileth
greatly to the perfecting
of the new Man within vs: they
ſtop their eares at all godly admonition
and heape one ſinne
vpon another; firſt, doing wickedly,
and afterwards taking delight
therein. Reſtitution therefore
to theſe kinde of people, is a moſt
vnwelcome gueſt: they may ill
abide to ſee her in the companie
of others; and therefore by no
meanes will entertaine her themſelues.
But let them ſooth their
owne opinions, and ſet light by
Gods iudgements as long as pleaſeth

them: the leſſe ſhame they
haue in this world before men, of
their cloſe and vniuſt gettings, and
the leſſe account they make of Reſtitution
or making amends here;
the greater wil be their horror and
confuſion in the next, & the ſtricter
reckoning will God exact at
their hands. For ſuch perſons this
Treatiſe was not framed, as being
a Pearle not to be caſt before ſuch
Swine. To the children of God in
Chriſt Ieſu, it is directed, that are
capable of goodnes through him,
and enabled to bring forth fruits
worthy of amendment of life; that
walke not after the fleſh, but after
the ſpirit. To them it is giuen to
know the myſteries of the Kingdome

of God, and to walke in
his wayes. In briefe therefore I
addreſſe my ſelfe to you my deare
brethren: exhorting you to ſeale
vp vnto your ſoules and conſciences
the aſſurance of the hope that
is in you, by putting off the Old
Man, and putting on the New;
walking before God in holineſſe
and vprightnes of liuing, as becommeth
his children: For the
attaining whereof, to the glorie of
God, and the good of his Church;
I thought it very behouefull to
write this ſhort Diſcourſe vppon
Reſtitution; which is ſo eſpeciall a
part of Chriſtian dutie, and yet in
theſe times ſo little regarded. Thus
wiſhing from my very heart. That

all men would beware how they
offer wrong, and after offences
paſt to make ſatisfaction: likewiſe
that thoſe which ſuffer wrong,
would not be carried headlong to
ſeeke reuenge, but alwaies endeuour
to preſerue vnity in the bond
of peace; I commend theſe my labors,
ſuch as they be, to your Chriſtian
conſiderations: deſiring
God, ſo to imprint the meditation
hereof in your mindes, that if you
haue gotten any thing wrongfully,
you may bee moued with Zacheus
to make Reſtitution:
            
            Laus Deo.
