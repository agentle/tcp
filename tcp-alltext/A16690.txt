               TO THE RIGHT WORſhipfull his verie louing Couſin, M. Thomas Huſſey Eſquier, Stephan Bredwell wiſheth all encreaſe of Chriſtian knowledge, zeale, and worſhip.
            
               THe life of a Chriſtian (Right Worſhipfull) is aptly compared, by that skilfull teacher S.1. Cor. 9. 24. & Hebr. 12. 1. 
               Paul, vnto the running of a race for a game. The goale is the end of this life, and the game or price, the crowne of glory. Now as they that ſtriue for games, carefullie prepare their bodies for greateſt fitnes and vantage, to their enterpriſe, and thereto long before, applie their whole ſtudie and inuention, euen ſo will euerie true Chriſtian, aduiſe of the race of his preſent life, as, at the end thereof, a price may be giuen vnto him. Which ſimilitude, as it hath great light to induce vs to conceiue the exhortation of ſcripture ſtudies, and heauenlie meditations, ſo yet ſhall it further enforce vs, if wee conſider it cloathed in the fit circumſtances of time. For like as a man that is to

ſtriue for a maſtrie, doeth ſo much the more buſie himſelfe in all his preparations, as hee perceiueth himſelfe to bee more vrged with ſhortnes of time, and other difficulties in the place of his triall, ſo wil the ſhortnes & euilnes of our time (if we waie it well) quicken our care, & ſtir vp our vttermoſt endeuour, to fruſtrate euen all the inconueniences therof whatſoeuer. And certainly if wee ſtand vpon this circumſtance of time, whether we behold the ſhortnes or the euilnes thereof, either way it will bee concluded, that if we loue our owne ſaluation, and hope to attaine that crown of life, it ſtandeth vs vpon, to ſhape out ſo much time, to the ſearch and ſtudie of the ſcriptures of God, as that wee may worthely be numbred with thē, which the Prophet Dauid ſaith, do meditate vponPſalme. 1. the law of God both daie and night. For if the Lorde iuſtlie require obedience to his will, and withall mercifullie haue left vs the exact fourme thereof in his word, how ſhall not we be guiltie of our own blood ſpilling, if by ignorance we erre, and by erring enkindle his hote diſpleaſure againſt vs? The ſhortnes of time muſt whet vs on more egerly, whether wee think of the ficklenes of mans

life (whoſe breath is in his noſthrils) or els of the diſſolution of all things, ſo readie now at hand. The ſhortnes and vncertain ſtate of this life, muſt tell vs in the mids of our temporall profits and pleaſures, when our affections would begin to feed vpon them, and our hearts offer to ſit downe in them, that it may in no wiſe be ſo with vs, wee may paſſe through as with a light touch, the neceſſarie and lawful vſe of theſe things, but our dwelling muſt ſtill bee in remouing tentes, vntill wee come to Canaan. Yea it muſt daily crie in our eares, break off, & be brief in all things belonging to bodely prouiſiō, for great matters haue you to ſet in order, and verie little time to do them in. Alſo it ſhall vpbraid vnto vs our negligēce (if we faile in this watchfulnes) as ſauouring ſtrongly of hypocriſie: when it ſhall ſtir vp the witneſſe of our own conſcience againſt vs, that wee are not ſo carefull for heauenly things, as for the earthly. Now if to the ſhortnes of mans age, we adioyne the ruinous cōdition of this world, readie (for ought we know) euerie moment to fall from the foundations (and vvhich ſhal bee done ſodenly vvithout vvarning vvhen it commeth) there ſeemeth to bee no corner

for fooliſh ſecuritie to hide her head in. But the arguments that might be dravvne, from the iniquitie and malice of the preſent time, are yet (if it vvere poſsible) more vehement. For vvhether vve labour to learne the feare of God, or yet ſet foorth our ſelues to practiſe the ſame ſincerely, in either vvay is danger, and offenſiue places to fall vpon. The Deuil knovveth his time to be but ſhort, and therefore he beſtirreth his ſtumps moſt buſily. Againſt vve ſhould learne, he frayeth vs vvith hereſies and diſſentions in the church. Whileſt we are learning, he ſeeketh to enſnare vs vvith vnſoundnes. If both theſe faile him, yet in our practiſe, he vvill heape vpon our backes reproaches and perſecutions, till vve groane again. It is hard to ſaie, vvhether thoſe that he holdeth back vvith the firſt engine, or els they that hee ouerthrovveth vvith the tvvo latter, be moe in nūber. That there are verie manie of the firſt ſort, vvee may gather by this common and prophane obiection: What religion ſhould we reſt vpō, when wee ſee ſo manie opinions in the world? Or who ſhould we beleeue, when the Preachers agree not among themſelues? This obiection (I ſaie) being commonly in the mouthes of

high & lovv, as it nakedly bevvraieth their ſhameful ignorance in the ſcriptures, ſo doth it openlie diſcouer the rottennes that is in their hearts before the Lorde. For vvere it not, that they haue ſetled themſelues vponZeph.

                  . their lees, and like it beſt of all, to be ignorant of the vvay of truth, leſt their darknes ſhould be controlled by the light therof, they ſhould finde in the ſcriptures ſtrong leauers, to lift out of their vvaie this ſtumbling block. The Lord by Moſes telleth the children of Iſraell,Deut. 1

                  . that if a falſe Prophet ſhould riſe vp amōgſt them, to ſeduce them vnto ſtrange gods, they ſhould not harken vnto him, but take it, as a matter vvherein the Lord did proue & trie them, vvhether they loued him vvith all their heart, and vvith all their minde, or no. To the ſame effect ſpeaketh Paul, There muſt

               ariſe, in the laſt times, ſo as to ſeduce (if it were poſsible) the verie elect. And immediatlie addeth, Behold I haue told you before

               hand. Now if the Lorde haue dealt ſo graiouſlie with vs in his word, as to leaue vs

inſtruction therin to furniſh vs againſt theſe offences, and wee delighting in our owne ſhame, wilfullie depriue our ſelues of the benefit thereof, can we thinke by that means to eſcape the reuenging hand of the almightie? Surelie common ſenſe doth tell vs, that if ſuch men had but one right ſparke of the loue of God in them, they would be ſo farre of, remouing or abſtaining themſelues, from the ſtudie of the ſcriptures, at the ſight of theſe ſwarmes of hereſies, as that much rather, they would ſiſe out farre larger times thereunto, and bend their wits with greater force, to ſort out the trueth from euerie falſhood: eſpeciallie ſeeing the iſſues of truth and falſhoode, are life & death. Others looke into the liues of profeſſors, and willinglie from thence take occaſion of falling. Do you not ſee (ſaie they) that manie of theſe profeſſors, ſaie well, but doe euil? Nay ſome of them feare not to multiplie their ſinne with blaſphemie, ſaying, There is not the beſt of them all, but will doe as other men doe, when occaſion is offred, they meane, when ſinne commeth to hand. In deede manie profeſſors giue euil example by their liues, a great number being hipocrites. Yea amongſt the ſincere,

manie ſhew their ſlips and falles, whileſt yet the new man is tender and not come to his growth. If anie man at the ſight of theſe thinges, either deferre his comming, or yet ſlacken his hold, woe ſhalbe his portion. For theſe thinges alſo hath the Lorde forewarned vs of, ſaying, Becauſe that iniquitie
               Mat. 24. 12. 
               ſhalbe multiplied, the loue of manie ſhal waxe cold. Is not this a faire watchword? Then he addeth, But he that endureth to the end ſhalbe ſaued. Which is a flat priuatiō of the health and ſaluation of all ſuch, as ſhall take offence, and giue backe, at the ſight of iniquitie in others. Thoſe that ſay, There is not the beſt of theſe holy profeſſors but will, doe as others doe, ſpeake it not as a knowne trueth, (for it is a manifeſt lie) but becauſe ſinne hath ſuch dominion ouer them, as that it can not once enter into their heades, to conceiue what a caſe the mortification of a Chriſtian may be: like as it is ſaid in our prouerbe: He that is in hell, thinketh there is no heauen. But howſoeuer theſe wretches feede themſelues in their ſins, with this imagination, that all doe accompanie them, (as though all were well, if they had companie inough to goe to the diuel,) yet (if the Lord grant them not better grace)

they ſhall find, (all too late,) that they were much deceiued, in manie their ſuppoſed cō
               panions. Thoſe therefore that are the Lords▪ will be ſo farre off diſcouraging, or cooling, by the euil examples of profeſſors, as that rather, their heede, ſtudie and watchfulneſſe, will be doubled in them by it. The ſame likewiſe I ſay, by all other iniquities, and iniuries of time, that can be reckoned. Doe we ſee ſecret and open perſecution or violence prepared for vs? Let vs remember that the diſciple is not aboue his maiſter, nor the
               Mat. 10. 24. 
               ſeruant aboue his Lorde. Doe they lade vs with odious names and titles, and deride our ſimplicitie as Iſmael did Iſaac? Let vs notGen. 21. 9. be diſcouraged. Is it not ioy to vs, to bee like our Lorde and maiſter Chriſt? If they called the father of the houſhold Beelzebub,
               Mat. 10. 25. 
               how much more his ſeruants? Yea, let the prophane filthians euen afflict vs for holy exerciſes, and crie out of vs, as not the friendes of Caeſar, becauſe we wincke not at their wickedneſſe: let them (if they will) diſdaine vs euen the aire to breath withall, and themſelues vnder the cloake of our diſgrace, continue in all diſſoluteneſſe: wee ſhall not ſaint hereat. It ſhall but declare vs to be the

If any thinke ſtraunge, that one of another profeſſion hath done this: I ſuppoſe they wil eaſily be ſatiſfied, when they ſhall cōſider, that the doctrine of our miniſters, being grieuouſlie ſlandred, ſeemed rather to require, this defence and teſtimonie from ſome of their hearers, then from them ſelues, in their own behalfe.

            ¶ THE FIRST PART againſt his wicked ſlaunder.
            
            
               IN your woordes (E. G.) to the reader, I vnderſtand the diſeaſe you propounde to cure, and in the reſt following, the cauſes of the ſame: the diſeaſe is, the euil life, or (to vſe your owne words) the ſorie life of manie, which ſeeme Zealous profeſſours. The cauſes are poyſon, and the giuers of that poyſon. The poyſon is, A perſuaſion that albeit men bee Ʋſurers, Extortioners, Drunken, Leacherous &c: as that no ſparckles of vertue, or grace appeare in them, yet if they at anie time, condemne this euill in them-ſelues, approue the contrarie godlines, belieue that their ſinnes are pardoned in Chriſt, loue theſe their teachers, and be beneficiall vnto them, and deſire to heare their delectable Sermons, they maie (though they ceaſe not from their former ſinnes) aſſure them-ſelues for all that to bee the deare children of God, ſanctified by Chriſts ſpirit, and ſo elect and praedeſtinate to ſaluation, as that they cannot poſſiblie bee damned, what ſinne ſoeuer they commit. The ſicknes I acknowledge 
                  〈◊〉
                too gréeuous, and this poyſon, I confeſſe, is as infectious as that of the Cockatrice. Who bée theſe mercileſſe murderers, that dare infect the f

If they bee worthelie ſuſpected as acceſſaries, that vpon an inquirie of murder, which they ſawe, direct the purſuers with doubtful and ambiguous notes to take the murderers: then muſt I charge you with as great a guiltines, that ſeeing ſo many ſoules poyſoned daily with this peſtilent doctrine, and knowing (as you ſeeme) the dooers thereof, could finde in your heart, to paſſe them vnnamed.

If you aſke mee, whether thoſe be the beſt preachers, that make a great ſhewe of godlines, and

Naie doo you ſaie, that it is taught generally, or for the moſt part, in the Church of England? (ſpeake plainelie man, and be not cawtelous like the old ſerpent.) If here you woulde ſhrinke, the want of ſuch exceptiōs in your writing, your quarelling at ſuch pointes of doctrine, as they all dooe holde with ſwéete conſent, the generall accuſation of the liues of the goſpellers, together with your wilfull departure from our Church, are as a walle behinde you, ſo as you cannot hide your heade. And if you ſtande forth, and abide by it, then I aſke you, where is your euidence, where be your proofes and witneſſes? Haue you no déede of theirs to ſhew againſt them? Nor none to depoſe with you, and yet would you bée belieued of your bare worde? You (I ſaie) a priuate man, accuſinge the Church of God in a whole kingdome? What ſaide I (in a kingdome?)

But you ſaie, If they ſhall blame me, becauſe I bring not their meaning in their owne woordes, let them ſhew their meaning to be otherwiſe then I haue ſet it downe, or els all that feare God, and loue goodnes muſt needes abhorre them &c. Naie, rather it was your part, putting on the perſon of an accuſer, to haue built herein, vpon ſo ſure a groūd of profe, as that, either you would haue brought forth their owne wordes or writinges, ſaying ſo much expr

               ie, or (at leaſt) ſuch aſſertions, and ſentences, as out of which, you might reaſonablie gather it, by neceſſarie conſequence and implication. As for them, if their dailie preaching coulde beate no better vnderſtanding into your head, yet their infinite volumes, which euerie where confute this madnes, might haue made you bluſhe at your raſhnes, & haue cauſed your woordes to ſticke faſt in your mouth, that they might neuer haue come to light. You in this importunate arrogancie, prouoking them to ſhewe you another meaning, giue vs plaine enough to vnderſtande, that your ſelfe are altogether vnacquainted with their writinges: which if you bee, what madnes hath poſſeſſed you, to condemne the thinges you knowe not? If it be otherwiſe, and that you graunt, you are well acquainted with their doctrine, & therefore dooe of knowledge, charge them with this hainous

ſinne, then can it not be, but that you haue borowed y• yron forehead of ſome Jeſuite, which knoweth not howe to bluſhe, euen in the moſt deſperate inſolencie of lying, and forgerie. Now I heare you ſay, But that men maie be ſure I belie them not, but ſpeake that, which is too true of them, it ſhalbe now ſhewed, how ſleightlie they peruert holy ſcripture, for the proofe of that which is layde to their charge.] Firſt let vs call to minde, (E. G.) the queſtion, wherein lieth the controuerſie betwixt vs. This is it, Whether the preachers of the goſpell teache, that Vſurers, Extortioners, Couetous men, proude men, Leacherous perſons, drunkardes, gluttons, &c. Hauing no ſparkles of vertue or grace appearing in them, and continuing without ceaſſing in the foreſayde ſinnes, maie notwithſtandinge aſſure them-ſelues, to be the elect children of God, ſo as they cannot poſſibly bee damned what ſin ſoeuer they commit: onlie ſo, that, they ſometime condemne this euill in them ſelues, approue the contrarie godlines, belieue that their ſinnes are pardoned in Chriſt, loue theſe their teachers, & deſire to heare delectable ſermons. This you ſtiflie auouche, I vtterlie denie it, and put you to the proofe of it: you beginne to prooue it thus: They peruert holie ſcriptures to that ende, therefore they ſaie ſomuch in effect. I deny they peruert holy ſcriptures to that end. Nowe giue vs your inſtances. The firſt place (which you call poyſon) is this: Paul (ſay they) was a ſanctified man, & the childe of God, and yet he fealt no good thing dwelling in his fleſhe, but the euill fruites thereoof: yea, he fealt a lawe, or power of ſinne
               
               in his members, forcing him to doo the euill he would not, and to leaue vndone the good hee woulde, and ſo leading him captiue to commit ſinne.
            
            If you had meant ſincerelie, you would haue produced nothing of their owne againſt them, without notinge their names, or coatinge ſuch places in their writinges, as might witnes your reporte. This by the waie. Nowe to the place, wherby you would gaine your cauſe, if I ſhould grant vnto you, that this place of Paul is miſinter preted by them (which you ſhall neuer gaine at my hands) yet, how can you out of this place make good your accuſation againſt them? Was it for lack of will, or ſkill, that you ſhew not how you gather your cōcluſion, out of this aſſertion? That your will is good, experience teacheth vs: that your ſkill is not ſufficient, argueth more pride. Remember (E. G.) that you ſaid not barelie you would ſhew how, They peruert holie ſcriptures, But how they peruert them, to proue this, which you lay to their charge? Now if you ſhew a hundreth euidences, and yet neuer a one, that ſpecifieth that lande you claime, what iudge will giue ſentence on your ſide? So, though it were poſſible for you, to charge the miniſters of the goſpell, with manie other crimes, and yet faile in the proofe of this one, you haue nowe vndertaken, all this labour in your ſorie booke is loſt: naie, I would it were ſo loſt, as it might not bee found, to redouble your condemnation. But let vs examine that which you haue left at libertie. If by this place you ſaide anie thinge at all for

your cauſe, then thus you reaſon: All that vnderſtand this place of Paul, thus dooe it to conclude that which I haue laide to their charge, but the Preachers of the Goſpell generally vnderſtande it ſo, therefore they dooe it to that end. But that the firſt part of your argument hath no truth in it, I would grant your concluſion. For I grant the preachers of the goſpell generally, doo interprete that place ſo, and therefore I rightly pronounced of you, that you accuſe not the Church of England onlie, of Libertine preaching, but al others of the goſpell likewiſe, throughout Chriſtendome, with it. But wée will not yet throw awaie your argument, but rather proſecute it to the vt-moſt, to ſee if anie pith of reaſon maie bee found in it. This place of Paul, thus vnderſtood, what can it conclude? Forſooth, that a regenerate man, and elect childe of God, ſo long as hée beareth fleſh and bloud about with him, cannot be frée from all ſinne. The reaſon is, becauſe ſo notable a veſſell as Paul, teſtifieth ſo-much of him-ſelfe. Now ſir, is it all one, to ſaie, the regenerate man is not frée from all ſinne, with this, That Drunkards, Gluttons, Leachours, &c. though they continue in their ſinnes without ceaſſinge, maie neuertheleſſe aſſure them-ſelues to be ſaued, if they belieue their ſinnes are pardoned in Chriſte, &c? And doo all that conclude the firſt point, auouche the latter leaſing? I hope, by this time, your impudencie in this pointe is open. The ſecond inſtaunce you bring vs is this: But they obiect that Paul witneſſeth of him-ſelfe, that he had a pricke in
               
               the fleſhe, and that God would not deliuer him from that weakenes. Goe to, if this interpretation of Paules pricke bee not aright, what maketh it for you? Are you ſo ſhort witted (E. G.) as ſo ſoone to forget what ſo latelie you aſſumed and tooke vpon you to ſhew: namely, how they peruert holy ſcripture to proue that wicked doctrine which you charge them withall? Els, why doo you not vncouer the danger of this interpretation, and make manifeſt, how it leadeth to that terrible downefall of peſtilent perſuaſion aforeſaid? All that haue common ſenſe in them, ſée that this place, (noting onlie holie Paul to haue his infirmities) hatcheth no ſuch monſter, as you, in a ſpirituall drunkennes, haue dreamed of. And thus you go forward to a third inſtance. It is ſet downe (ſay they) for a certaine point of doctrine,
               Gal. 5. 17. 
               that the ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh, and the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, ſo that ye cannot do the things ye would. This, confirming the interpretation of the firſt place of Paul, ſetteth the picture of your minde, as it were in a glaſſe, before mine eies: wherein I ſee, that ſome godlie men hauing taken paines with you, to remoue you frō your errours, and namely from this, which you hold, That the regenerate man hath full power to abſtaine from all ſin, and to doo the works of righteouſnes, haue in their conference vrged you with theſe places of Paul, which you reſiſting, as a man voide of all vnderſtanding, can make no difference betwéene light and darknes, life and death, heauen and hell. To the fourth place

you bring, They will aske then from whence came that will to doo well, &c.] Prouing good the former interpretation of the ſeuenth to the Romans, and affording neuer a word for your mō
               ſtrous accuſation, what ſhould I ſaie, but that it is truely verified of you, A true witnes deliuerethProu. 14. 25. ſoules, but a deceiuer forgeth lies. The fift obiection, wherein you ſaie [They make the inuer man, and the ſpirit of Chriſt all one] as it maketh neither too nor fro, for your cauſe, ſo is it a baſtard (perhaps) of your own begetting: the Preachers of the Goſpell teach it not. This man is deſperately bent to ſlaunder, that forgeth falſe obiections to féed the fire of his quarrell? If anie your friends (E. G.) think it not likely that you forged it, becauſe you made it no more pregnant for the proofe of your cauſe, let them know, that as this argument hath not vertue enough to cleare you of iuſt ſuſpition, though you be ſuffered to enforce it as far as you can, ſo contrariwiſe it being exactly weighed in the vnpartiall balance, of vpright and circumſpect iudgement, dooth not onlie point in ſecret, to the forgery, but as in certaine cyphres alſo, vncouer the cauſe, and (as it were) the cogitation of your hart therin. For whileſt it proueth nothing your accuſation, but is onlie vſed by you, as a plaine ſong, for your furious penne to deſcant vpon, what els appeareth it, but ſome new affected ſtanding, wherein you would ſet to ſale other farre fetcht wares of your pelagian hereſie? All which ſtuffe (the Lord willing) ſhalbe ſorted out, and examined

hereafter, in his fitter place. Your ſixt inſtance, of there peruerting ſcriptures, to teach that wicked doctrine you accuſe them of, is this: That they ſaie, the holie Ghoſt meaneth him onlie, to be the ſeruant of ſin, and of the deuill, who willingly with delight, committeth ſin, not miſliking, nor ſtriuing againſt it. If (I ſaie) this interpretation were not aright, yet it ſaith neuer a word, ne giueth one backe, nor winke, to witneſſe againſt the teachers thereof, the intoilerable accuſation which you, as one that cannot bluſh, haue laide againſt them. Therefore take vnto you this ſaying of wiſe Salomon, as a glaſſe wherein to ſée your ſelfe, if poſſibly anie prick of remorſe maie pearſe into you: Fooliſhnes is ioy to himProu. 15. 21. that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding, but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly. And a litle before: The mind of the prudent ſeekethVerſe. 14. knowledge, but the mouth of fooles is fedde with fooliſhnes. What I can ſaie, to warrant their aſſertion, you ſhal heare anon, after I haue once throughly ſhewed, how honeſt a man you are of your word. Yet or I paſſe, let it be noted in this place, that of theſe ſix witneſſes, which you haue (indéede) not orderlie produced, but forcibly haled into the Court, to teſtifie for you, not one of them would doo you that fauour, as to giue you a good countenance, but preſentlie turned their backes, ſo ſoone as the matter was but repeated, and in a deepe ſilence departed. Wherefore now at length, being ſomewhat ſpent of witneſſes, and hardly diſtreſſed in your

cauſe, you ſet forth your ſelfe, to entertaine your iudges, partly with the odious repetitiō of your vnproued ſlaunder, and partly with a new craft of ſubtile inſinuation, as though our Miniſters indéed by an argument of compariſon, did driue at ſome ſuch concluſion as you haue enforced vpon them. For anſwere whereunto, I muſt tell you, firſt, that whileſt you procéed thus, you betraie the verie iſſue of your cauſe into my hands. For whereas in the beginning, you knew that our Preachers ſaide not that in expreſſe words, which you accuſe them of, and yet charged them ſtill to teach no other thing in effect, you grew on then to this point, that you would proue it, by ſhewing how they peruert the holie ſcriptures to that end. Hereupon wée haue ioyned our iſſue, hitherto your proofes haue failed, and now you fall a ſhifting, as though you would alter your iſſue. So that A wauering minded man is vnconſtant in all his waies. But I am content to make no gain of this vantage, my cauſe is full ſo good, as that I doubt not to ouerthrow you, although I yeld you all thoſe liberties & helpes, that may any way (lawfully) be vſed of you in this caſe. Now let vs hear you. Theſe men (you ſay) do hold, That the ſpirit is in their belieuers, though they bee wholy poſſeſſed of pride, couetouſneſſe. &c. becauſe wee ſee fier may bee raked vnder the aſhes, and the ſap may be in the root of the tree, and yet appeare not. Which men? where be they? when heard you it (E. G?) (lying is no lawfull helpe, I can not graunt it you.) Or

if you heard it not, perhaps you might reade it, tel vs, what writers do ſo apply that ſimilitude? for this he bringeth not a ſillable to ſatiſfie vs. O beaſtlie impudencie. O Babiloniſh pride. O palpable impietie. But I will ſtay my ſelfe in exclaming, though this man hath neither ſtop nor ſtay in lying. But do you perſwade your ſelfe (E. G.) there are anie ſo ſeruilely addicted to your hereſie, as that they ſhoulde eaſely brooke this lothſomneſſe, of your lying and forgerie? for my part, though I know (as experience of all ages hath confirmed vnto vs) that there is no hereſie ſo foule or vgglie, but it ſhal finde too manie fitte ſubiects to receiue▪ it (ſuch is the iuſt iudgement of God, vpon thoſe that reſt not them ſelues in his trueth) yet am I in very good hope,Rom. 1. 24. 26. 2. Theſ. 2. 11. that this groſſe impudencie, and apparant ſinne of ſlander, which thus raigneth in you, throughout all your writing, will giue as cleare light as the ſunne, vnto the conſciences of all thoſe that haue anie feeling, not onelie that your accuſation is without proofe, but alſo that your opinion, of the full power, of the regenerate man, ouer al his waies, to abſteine from euil, and keepe the commandements is, (beſides the falſhood of it) a verie monſter, fearefull and venomous, not to be approached of anie, that would auoide the poyſoning of their ſoules. But of this more fully in his place. Meane time, let euerie faithful brother know this, that the miniſters of the Churches, profeſſing the goſpel, generallie throughout Chriſtendom (I ſpeake not of anie limbes

of the diuel in corners) do vſe this ſimilitude, of fire raked vnder the aſhes, and ſap in the rootes of the trees, onely in the caſe of ſome afflicted conſcience, and not otherwiſe. As for example: there be manie deare children of God, that either immediatlie vpon their new begetting to the faith, or ſhortly after, in the growing vp of the ſame (God in his wiſedom ſo ſeeing it good for them) are, not ſo daungerouſly, as grieuouſly (for the time) aſſailed of Sathan, with diuers ſtormes of doubtfulneſſe, dreades, and diſcomfortes, and amongſt the reſt, with the terrour of the remembrance of ſome ſpeciall time, wherein the fruites of their faith appeared not: with which terrour, ſo ſoone as euer he hath dumpped them, he ſlacketh no time (preſentlie to waielaie them with this two-fold ſnare: to wit, either that their faith (which before they had ſtoode vpon) was no true faith, but a counterfeit (ſaith he) becauſe it was not fruitfull by workes, or els though it were at firſt a true faith, yet now, they had loſt it, by their owne negligence: by one of which hookes it commeth often to paſſe, that the humbled ſoule is hurried (as it were) to the gates of hell, before it obtaine deliuerance. In which caſe, when the miniſter of Chriſtes glad tidinges, finding anie, ſhall ſay to him: this argument that Sathan oppoſeth you withall is ſophiſticall and falſe, and he doth it, but in the rage of his malice, to drowne you in doubtfulneſſe and deſpaire. For, the intermitting of good workes, doth not neceſſarilie conclude a voidnes

of faith, no more then you can truelie ſay, of fire vnder the aſhes, or of a tree whoſe ſappe (as in winter) is withdrawne to the rootes, either that the one is quite put out, or the other vtterlie deade. By this ſimilitude (I ſay) if the miniſter of the goſpel ſhall detect the fraud of the diuel, and reach a hand for the diſtreſſed ſoule, to bee lifted out of the mire by: what doth he worthie blame therein? or not warrantable by the eternall word of trueth? Thus let the faithfull reader in this place, obſerue, that this ſhameleſſe mouth, hath brought nothing by this place, but one vnaltouchable ſlaunder to maintaine another. After this, he retnrneth to his iſſue againe, as though he would ſhew how our preachers peruert the holie ſcriptures for the end aforeſaid: though with no better ſucceſſe then before. Thus he ſetteth downe the places: Chriſtes ſheepe
               Io. 10. 28. 
               (ſay they) can neuer periſh, neither cā any man plucke them out of his hands: for whom he loueth, he loueth
               Io. 13. 1. Philip. 1. 6. 
               to the end, and in whomſoeuer he hath begon this good worke of regeneration, in them he will performe
               Rom. 11. 2
                     •
                  . 
               it: for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance.
            
            Were it not for the ſimple ſoules ſakes, which by this confident writing you ſuppoſe to carrie away, no man would file his handes with ſo ſenſeles an aduerſarie: for as a man that hath a feuer, reliſheth the thinges he taketh (manie times) according to the humor that afflicteth him, ſo that (ſometime) the moſt pleaſant ſupping is bitter in his mouth, in like ſorte fareth it

with you (E. G.) that can heare of our preachers neither the ſcriptures alledged, to proue the regenerate ſubiect to ſinne manie times, or that the elect can not vtterlie fall away, but ſtraightwaies you muſt needs conclude that they maintaine groſſe wickednes to raigne in the children of God, & warrant them of ſaluation, notwithſtanding, vpon moſt light conditions. But would you were no further gone, that I might ſtay, with comparing you to a ſimple feueriſh man. I would your ague had not affected the originall of ſenſe, and hurt your vnderſtanding, ſo that now, euen as a man frantike, is no longer ruled and kept in order by anie, but reiecing the counſaile of his beſt friendes, accuſeth them moſt as otherwiſe ill minded, becauſe they moſt reſtraine him in all his will, that might hurt him: in like ſort, you, being troubled inwardlie with ſome heriticall frenſies, woulde make men belieue that the doctrine of our preachers, tendeth to ſome generall euil, becauſe in trueth, it moſt notoriouſly laboureth againſt your errours: and will not ſuffer you peaceably to broach, neither your hereſie of free will, nor y• againſt the Lords eternal predeſtinatiō. Otherwiſe (I ſay) were it not, that you are caried in the rage of theſe frenſies, maliciouſly to kill their credit, with ſo odious an accuſation, whiles you in the meane time, may get placing for your peſtilence, all indifferent men ſee, that neither theſe your laſt places, nor all the inſtances you haue hetherto vrged, do anie more iuſtifie you,

for an honeſt man of your worde, (that ſaid you would ſhew, how they peruert holie ſcriptures to iuſtifie the wicked) then the fruite of the crabtree, anſwereth the beautie of his bloſſomes, wherewith before, both for colour, plentie, and largenes, he had giuen greater expectation then anie aple trees: yea ſo much leſſe tollerable are you herein, then the crabtrée, inaſmuch as his fruite, yeldeth commoditie to the vſe of mans life: but this your booke, bane and poyſon, to deſtroy as manie ſoules as embrace it. This your ſhameleſſe ſlaunder, you haue deuiſed to make ſeeme likelie, by patching vnto it, ſome fooliſh conditions, of your owne forging, as though the preachers of the goſpel ſhould make open ſale of the graces of God, to all the vncleane beaſtes of the fielde, euen for their owne promotion and bellies ſake: which hauing alike, both proofe and trueth, with all the reſt, I am ſorie, that the father of lyes, could obtaine ſo much libertie to leade you.
         
         
            
               THE SECOND PART againſt his hereticall doctrine.
            
               HEtherto I haue detected your impudent ſlaunder (E. G.) now I come to the pointes of doctrine betweene vs. And to beginne at your firſt inſtance, I confeſſe, we are taught by the preachers of the Goſpel, that the regenerat, whileſt they liue, are not free from ſinne: and that this is an argument

whereby they proue it, namely, becauſe that ſpeciall veſſel S. Paule, confeſſeth ſo muchRom. 7. 15. 18. 22. 33. by himſelfe. You, hauing a quarrel to the queſtion, flatlie denie that Paule confeſſed anie ſuch thing of him ſelfe, touching his regenerate ſtate, but only of his eſtate, when he was a carnal mā, ſolde vnder ſin. &c. Your reaſons ſuch as they are, let vs firſt examine. Becauſe Paule in that Chapter confeſſed
               verſe 14▪
                
               him ſelfe a carnall man, ſold to be ſubiect to ſin, therefore he meant not there, of his regenerate eſtate. If to be regenerate and yet carnall in diuers reſpectes, could not poſſibly be verified of one man, your reaſon were good, but now, becauſe there is no man ſo perfectlie regenerate, but that ſtill he is withall, partlie vnregenerate, and carnall, therefore Paule in regarde of this, might well call him ſelfe carnall, though ſo farre forth, as he was regenerate, hee was otherwiſe. And this he declareth plainely afterwarde when hee ſaith, I do not the good that I would, but the euil that I would not, that doe I. Now noverſe. 19. man doth anie euil vnwillingly, but by reaſon of a contrarie power that is in him reſiſting euil. Wherefore alſo, the Apoſtle accounteth it not abſurd, according to thoſe diuers reſpects, to call himſelfe in the 25. verſe; both the ſeruant of the law of God, and of ſinne. And the rather I muſt enforce this argumēt, becauſe although you denie al the reſt of y• chapter, to cōcerne Paul as a regenerate man, yet the 25. verſe you acknowledge to that effect. And in y• ſame verſe (if your eyes had not dazled) you might haue ſeene that the Apoſtle after his thankes giuing, for

his deliuerance from the danger of that ſame bodie of death, againſt which he had exclamed, confeſſeth that euen then, as touching his minde, he ſerued the law of God, but in his fleſh the law of ſinne. Which place is as cleare as the ſun-ſhine, not onelie to ſhew the falſhood of your firſt reaſon againſt our interpretation of the 7. to the Rom. but alſo to proue, ſo your great ſhame, the trueth of the generall aſſertion aforeſaide: namelie, that The regenerate are not free frō ſinne. Yet theſe are not all the foiles you receiue by it, for it cutteth likewiſe the throte of your ſecond reaſon, before it haue time to draw one breath of life. for where you ſay, Therefore after this, he thanketh God in Chriſt, that he was deliuered from that bodie of ſinne, which made him to doe that euil he would not, and to leaue vndone the good he would. You would make vs belieue, that Paul in this place was a changed man, ſo as he could no more ſin vnwillinglie, as before: which purpoſe of yours, now you ſée, is preuented, and therefore your reaſon ſpoilde: yet ere I paſſe, I muſt admoniſh the Reader, to conſider of what ſpirite, this ſauoureth, that in alledging the 25. verſe, which ſoundeth thus, I thanke my God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. Now therefore euen I in my minde, doe ſerue the law of God, but in my fleſh, the law of Sinne. He bringeth it out thus: He thanketh God in Chriſt, and ſo cutteth off all the reſt, but chopping into the roome thereof theſe wordes, that he was deliuered from that bodie of ſin, which made him to do that euil he would not, and to leaue vndone the good
               
               he would. A ſentence (I confeſſe) of like length, but neither of like nature nor trueth. If anie ſay for E. G. (For now I vnderſtand he is dead) that he added that part, not as to haue it taken, for the wordes of ſcripture, but the ſenſe of the place: I could eaſely admit that anſwere, were it not for the ſakes of ſome, of his ſect, who (as I vnderſtand) can not read at all, and yet are very ſtiffe in his opinions, I know not, how they haue béene this way abuſed. Beſides, it is not comuenient, in citing of ſcripture, to ſow anie peeces of our owne into it: without putting ſome partition wall betwixt, or bringing in the ſeruant, in ſome differing weed from his maiſter, that the one be not taken for the other, of the commers in. Moreouer if hee bring thoſe wordes for the meaning of the place, yet hee is too impudent, and blaſphemous, preſuming to ſpeake directlie againſt the ſpirite of God: which it is cleare that hee doth, when the text ſaith, Paule had yet ſuch an enimie of fleſh about him, as ſerued the law of ſinne, and this man ſaith, Paule was now deliuered from that bodie of ſinne, as made him do the euil he would not: Two thinges in their ſubſtance, flat contrarie, though chaunge of wordes, at firſt, would ſeeme to couer it. But leſt we ſhould maruaile at this dealing, he makes a cuſtome of the matter, for the next place he bringeth out of the beginning of the 8. chap. where hee would faine make S.Rom. 8. Paule ſpeake, according to his humor, for whereas the text is, There is now therefore no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt
               
               Ieſus, which walke not according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirite. You muſt vnderſtand it, as it is thus paraphraſticallie deliuered by him: To them which are in Chriſt Ieſus, there is no condemnation (or no ſuch bodie of death, which is the cauſe of our condemnation) for they walke not after the fleſh (as he was forced to doe by the law of ſinne, when as he did the euil he would not, and left vndone the good hee would) but they walke after the ſpirite, and ſo doe the good they would. His boloneſſe here as before, whether it ſauour of Babilon or no, I leaue it to the chriſtian Reader to iudge. But three thinges muſt be obſerued and examined, wherein beyond al reaſon & warrant, he abuſeth this place of the Apoſtle. Firſt, for the worde [condemnation] by that, he wil haue vnderſtoode the bodie of death: therein without anie neceſſitie, tranſforming the effect into the cauſe as though he would cō
               pel the holie ghoſt to ſpeake for his purpoſe: but without all probabilitie: both foraſmuch, as that word is no where vſed in that ſenſe, as alſo this verſe, repeating the argument of the 5. chap. 1. verſe, of the ſame Epiſtle, concerning iuſtification by faith onely, proued by an argument drawne from the effectes, toucheth nothing at all that ſpeciall obiection, which hee anſwereth in the latter ende of the 7. chapter, whereby he was occaſioned ſo to handle that conflict of the fleſh and the ſpirite. So that then we ſée if (E. G.) would haue taken this worde (condemnation) in his naturall ſenſe, and not malitiouſly peruerted it, as one that would wilfullie

runne into the pit, he ſhould haue béene ſo farre off finding his bodie of death in it, as that much rather the ſunne ſhine of comfort would appeared vnto him, to haue baniſhed the night of dark diſcomfort, that came vpon him in his ſickneſſe: when as this place rather would haue told him, there is no condemnation towardes thee if thou be Chriſtes: agréeably whereto the ſpirite ſaith in the 33. and 34. verſes afterwarde, [who ſhall laye anie faultes againſt the elect of God? It is God that iuſtifieth: who is hee that ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt that is dead, yea rather that is riſen againe, who ſitteth alſo at the right hand of God, and entreateth for vs. The ſecond thing I obſerue, is concerning theſe wordes: [They walke not after the fleſh] which walking he taketh to be al one with that, S. Paule calleth, the law of ſinne in his members, whereas he might aſwell haue compared a beaſt vnto a man: for by that other law in his members, it is manifeſt he meant the power of ſinne, which gate oportunities manie times againſt him, although in his inner man, to his might, he made reſiſtance: as all open eyes may ſée, both by the oppoſing of the law in the members to the inner man, as alſo by the whole ſuite and circumſtances of the text. Contrariewiſe, in the other place, Paule ſpeaketh of the minde giuing obedience to the law of the members, which he calleth To walke according to the fleſh, as when there is no reſiſtance made to ſinne. So that her
                  •
                the holie Ghoſt ſpeaketh of a whole man willingly going after ſin, there,

of a man, falling but ſometimes through infirmitie: alſo there he ſheweth in what reſpect the law hath a worke of death in our mortal bodies, (according to the obiection in the 13. verſe) but here he teacheth a note to know our ſelues truly iuſtified by (euen our ſanctification) according to the matters handled from the beginning of the ſixt chapter. Thirdly (E. G.) expoundeth [walking according to the ſpirit] to be a doing of the good we would.
                Either this is idle, or els it ſoundeth a full abilitie to do the good we would. And then I ſée well, one wilfull maiſter or Pilot, is able to caſt away a ſhip full of men. Let thoſe that haue béene hetherto addicted to this man, looke better to them ſelues, he hath giuen the ſhip in this place, one notable ſtroke, vpon the rocke of frée will, they can not endure many moe before they make ſhipwracke of faith. But he wil proue it (I trow) that they that walke after the ſpirite, can do what good they would: becauſe (forſooth) the Apoſtle affirmeth of him ſelfe in Chriſt, that the law, rule, or power of the ſpirit of life, which is in Chriſt Ieſus, did free and deliuer him frō the law, rule or power of ſinne, which before preuailed ouer him vnto death. The Reader muſt be aduertiſed, that this clauſe [which before preuailed ouer him vnto death] groweth not vnto the text, but is the addition of a preſumptuous ſpirite. And whereas he would ſéeme to borrow it from the places before cited in the 7. of the Rom. he blaſphemeth, there being no ſillable to proue that ſinne preuailed ouer Paule vnto death, but the flat contrarie. And whereas to make the word

               [law] in both places, the fuller to ſerue his turne by, he ſetteth to all his ſtrength to ſtretch it out, with theſe wordes, [rule or power] let him take héed, leſt, the text therby ſodenly breaking, he receiue ſome dangerous fall, for by [rule and power] he would haue vs vnderſtād an abſolute rule, or vngainſaid iuriſdiction, which the ſpirite of regeneratiō bringeth vs, by which, ſin ſhould be ſo baniſhed in vs, as no more to be able to ſhew his face, wherein he playeth Sathans part with vs, to beguile vs wt falſe allegatiō of ſcripture. not caring, ſo his ſenſe might ſtand, though he ſet the ſcripture at oddes with it ſelfe. For as Sathan tempting Chriſt, to throw him ſelfeMat. 4. 6. headlong from the Pinacle, ſollicited him thereuntoPſal. 91. 11. 12. with It is written: [he ſhall giue his angels charge ouer thee, & they ſhall hold thee vp in their handes, that thou hitte not thy foote againſt a ſtone: diſſembling in the meane time, that this muſt n
                  •

                     •
                  . 16. the place of Deut. Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God: ſo in like maner, this man, in ſtrayning here the text to this his ſenſe, would 
                  •
               aine haue vs, not to ſée, our fréedom by the law of the ſpirite, to be meant (in that place) a deliuerance, from the danger of ſinne and death, which the law brought vs into before, as Paule had proued in y• 7. chap. 7. 13. verſe, 6. & although the 25. verſe of the ſame chap. (which E. G. him ſelfe alloweth to be ſpoken of Paule a regenerate man) muſt neceſſarilie enforce it: when as

the Apoſtle ſaith there, Therefore euen I nowe in my minde, do ſerue the law of God, but in my fleſh, the law of ſinne. For otherwiſe, there is a plaine contradiction betwixt this place, and the 2. verſe of the 8. chap. if this mans interpretation thereof may ſtand. Well if you will not yet belieue him, now he ſends you to conſider the whole two chapters going before, and following after the ſaid 7. chap. And what ſhall we finde there for his purpoſe? forſooth That the Apoſtle doth plainely define the regenerate man to bee ſo dead to
               Rom. 5. 2. 4. 
               ſinne, as that he can not liue in ſinne, but in righteouſneſſe, (that is as long as he continueth a regenerat
               verſe. 7. 13. 19. 
               man) as that he doth leaue the cōmitting or ſeruing of ſinne, and he doth ſerue and do with his members righteouſneſſe, as he before did ſerue or commit ſinne, he hath his fruite in holines (and not in ſinne) and the end euerlaſting life. He is not in the fleſh (or a carnall man as was Paule before his delinerance frō
               
               Rom. 8. 9. 10. 
               the bodie of death) but he is in the ſpirite, his bodie of ſinne being ſo deade or mortified in reſpect of ſinne, as that he liueth in righteouſneſſe, and doth not the
               verſe. 11. 13. 
               deedes of the fleſh. Hath anie man heard a more vncertaine anſwere? if this man walke not like a giddie-braine, I neuer ſaw anie. He is off and on, here and there, faine he would ſpeake out and he dare not. The Apoſtle (ſaith he) doth plainely define the regenerate man, to bee ſo dead to ſinne, (who lookes not here for a great blow) as that he can not liue in ſin. Is it no better? alas poore faintling. But you may perceiue his heart was good, euē to haue ſtriken out his blow at length, that it might haue ſounded, The regenerate
               
               hath power not to ſin anie more: (which is ye ſtroke he muſt ſtrike, if he mean to war againſt our ſaid aſſertion) but he knew wel inough, that then, all ye ſcripturs which there he citeth, would haue laid hands on him. Again, next that, he interpreteth [cōmitting ſinne] by [ſeruing ſin] & contrarie wiſe in the next ſentence [ſeruing ſinne] by [committing ſinne.] And at latter end, ſaying, He that is in the ſpirite, liueth in righteouſnes, and doth not the deedes of the fleſh: he both offereth an inkling to his Diſciples, to take holde of his meaning, and withal cunningly reſerueth a vantage to himſelfe: to waſh his hands of the blooude of thoſe, he ſhould thereby ſeduce, as Pilate did his handes from the bloud of Chriſt: otherwiſe he would haue deliuered plainly thus: he that is in the ſpirite, liueth in righteouſneſſe, ſo that he doth not anie deedes of the fleſh anie more. To haue thus therefore pointed out his fraudulent dealing (for the ſimple ſoules ſakes) is anſwere inough for this place: for if I ſhould take anie other courſe therewith, I ſée not how a needleſſe ſtrife of wordes can be auoided, as where no cleare meaning can bee found, and I am warned, not to anſwere aProu. 16. foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leſt my ſelfe alſo become like him. I ſhall méete him more plainely hereafter, without theſe ſtarting holes, and that variable monſter of often regeneration with him, (which here he leadeth tyed in the ſtring of a parentheſis) and then ſhall they both féele (by the grace of God) the ſtrong hand of trueth to encounter them. Hitherto I will reduce,

as fitteſt for this place, the reſidue of the controuerſie, concerning the 7. to the Rom. which he as a man, that had waged battaile, both againſt trueth, and all good order, hath beſtowed other where. He acknowledgeth theſe ſixe reaſons to be brought (by our ſide) out of the 7. chap. to the Rom. to proue Pauls acknowledging of ſinne, euen in his regenerate eſtate. namely 1. In that he ſaith there, hee had a will to do well. 2. A loue of goodnes. 3. A loathing of euil. 4. A ſtrife againſt the fleſh. 5. A delight in the law of God, concerning the inner man. 6. That ſeruice of it in his mind: All which he ſuppoſeth to ſwoope downe, with the crooked taile of one falſe anſwere, to wif, that Theſe were no true affections, nor endeuours in Paul, nor any other, then do fall into a naturall man, knowing and approuing by force of conſcience, the law of God to be good, according as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Gentile in the firſt and ſecond of the Romans. I acknowledge the diſciple of A. C. and doubtDial. theol. in Epiſt. ad Rom. not (in the ſtrength of the Lord) to méete you both in this quarrell. Let vs firſt trie out the boundes and limits of the naturall man, by the line of Gods word, that ſo the dwelling of the righteous maie enioy the iuſt ſpace of his allotment. Then afterward, wée ſhall eaſelier examine, the affections and endeuours here ſpoken of, whether they concerned Paul, as he was prophane, or regenerate. The naturall man is to be viewed, as hée is ſimply diſpoſed in himſelfe, or as he is affected by the written law comming to him. Againe, of thoſe that are ſimply in their

naturals, ſome liue in a déeper ignorance, others in a greater light of knowledge. In the former rancke maie bee raunged the people of India, Gronnland, Canibals, &c. Whoſe liues (ſaue for ſome ſéed of religion, argued euen by their Idolatrous worſhip, which ſheweth they are perſuaded there is a God) ſeeme to differ but a litle from the verie bruit beaſts. Among thoſe of greater knowledge, let vs reckon the ciuiler nations, euen the Romans & Graecians themſelues:Rom. c. 1. c. 2. and of all theſe, the Apoſtle Paul maketh two orders: one both impudently cōmitting ſin, & alſoCap. 1. 32. defending the doers thereof. Another ſort more ſtaunch and reſtrained ſo far of defending, asCap. 2. 1. that they reprehend ſin in others. And this being the beſt kinde (as I may ſpeake) of naturall men, yet if we looke vpon him wel, we ſhal find, (though he caried a generall courſe of life, bent vnto vertue, God ſo brideling his euil affection, like as he dooth the affections of manie ciuil men in this life, ſo far foorth, as he ſeeth it expedient, for preſeruatiō of the generalitie of things) that his heart was neuer taken with loue of the law of God, his minde neuer delighted in it, much leſſe his will and purpoſe bent to practiſe it: all the ciuil honeſtie of his life, comming from ſome vncleane fountaines of worldly reſpects. For ſome are reſtrained and kept back with ſhame, ſome with feare of lawes, from breaking out into manie ſorts of filthines: others take the honeſter courſe of life, with propounding to themſelues a readie way thereby, to eſtimation, promotion, authoritie and rule: but not one ſéeketh

the Lord and his glory, (the deuice of mans hartPſal. 14. ver. 2. 3. Gen. 6. 5. & 
                     •
                  . 21. being euill, euen from his youth) and therefore not one loatheth euill, and willeth good, according to Gods law. Which point alſo the Apoſtle Paul well proueth, when he ſaith: Wee are not2. Cor. 3. 5. fit of our ſelues euen to think anie thing, as of our ſelues. And again, It is God that workethPhil. 2. verſe. 13. in you both to will and to performe, according to his franke beneuolence. So thus we ſee, the beſt naturall man, by his own light, cānot go ſo far as to haue a wil or deſire to ſerue God, ſo far is it of the trueth, that E. G. ſaith, The loue of goodnes, loathing of euill, ſtrife againſt the fleſh, delight in the law of God, &c. which Paul ſpeaketh of in the ſeuenth of the Romans, may proceed onlie from the force of conſcience, knowing and approuing naturally, the law of God to be good. Now let vs conſider what effect the written law taketh with the naturall man, and what procéedingRo. 7. ver. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. he maketh by it. Paul expreſſeth this in his own perſon, where purpoſely he ſheweth, what place the law tooke with him before hée was regenerate. To wit, By meanes of it, ſin tookeverſe. 8. occaſion to beget all maner of luſt in him. That it reuiued ſin in him, That in ſtead ofverſe. 9. verſe. 10. life it wrought death in him. And finally, that the law was ſo far vnable, to cruſh the force ofverſe 11. ſin in him, as that ſin much rather found a vantage to it ſelfe, by meanes of the Commandement, to ſeduce him, and to kill him. And in this reſpect, is the law called a Huſband, thatverſe. 5. begetteth fruit vnto death, the law of ſin, andRom. 8. 2. 1. Cor. 15. ve. 56 death: and The ſtrength of ſin. Thus wee

haue a ſight alſo of the naturall man, as he is affected, when the written law approcheth him, and ye ſee what he is, euen ſo far from being better diſpoſed by it, and framed to that tough battell and conflict, that Paul deſcribeth in himſelfe.From the 14. ve. of the 7. chap. to the Rom. to the 25. verſe. as that contrariwiſe, he is become by it much more ſinfull, & his affections brought to a greater outrage of rebellion, then before. How far the hipocrite by his enlightning, can go, beyond the mere naturall man, I am not ignorant, as appeareth hereafter. But neither hath the hipocrite anie ſuch conflict, as whoſe faith and religion is neuer vnfained. Therefore to conclude this point, ſith the naturall man, neither by his own light, nor yet by the light of the law, can attaine to be a partie in this combat, he muſt of neceſſitie, yeld the place to his better, namely to him whom the Lord hath ſanctified by his ſpirit, and made fit to endure it. And ſo it followeth, that thoſe, that haue armed thus the naturall man, and brought him foorth to the liſts, for ſo honorable an enterpriſe, muſt be content to ſuffer loſſe of their labour, and receiue the regenerate man (whom the king of kings hath made worthie) into his place. The reſt of E. G. anſwere to this place, (as, that Thoſe affections Paul mentioneth, might bee ſome good motions, and inſpirations of the ſpirit of Chriſt, which wicked men may haue,) beeing but a toye of his idle braine, without proofe, a begging of the controuerſie, and ſufficiently by this that is ſaid, diſproued, I will ſpend no further time withall. And thus hauing gained this place of the ſeuenth to the Romans. I conclude by it, the generall queſtion

thus: If Paul regenerate was ſubiect to ſin, then euerie regenerate perſon is ſubiect to ſinne, but Paule regenerate was ſo, as this place apertly proueth, therfore our Miniſters teach truly, that no regenerate perſon is frée from ſin. This they confirme by two other places of ſcripture: the firſt is, wheras Paul witneſſeth of him ſelfe, that hee had a prick in the fleſh, and that2. Cor. 12. 6. 8. 9. God would not deliuer him from that weaknes. E. G. ſaith, They peruert this ſcripture: What is his reaſon? Becauſe The Apoſtle ſheweth, that this was a prick painfull, not delightful to the fleſh, as is ſin. Well, thus then hee reaſoneth, Sin is delightful to the fleſh, but this prick was not deliteful to the fleſh, therfore this prick was ſin. I anſwere, if by fleſh he vnderſtand the vnregenerat part of Paul, as vſually the ſcripture doth, in ſuch caſes, then is it falſe that he ſaith, [This prick was not delightfull to the fleſh] but if by fleſh, he meane whole Paul, (as by his next words [It was a meſſenger of Sathan ſent to buffet his fleſh, not to tempt him to ſin] he muſt néeds doo, or elshée corrupteth the text) then the firſt part of his argument is falſe, where he ſaith: Sin is delightfull to the fleſh. For it is proued before, that ſin is loathſome to the regenerate man, and he doth it vnwillingly▪ whenſoeuer he falleth into ſin. So here we ſee, this man would ſophiſtically beguile vs, with a failation of Homonymie. Concerning that he ſaith, This prick was a meſſenger of Satan, ſent to beat or buffet his fleſh, not to tempt him to ſin. Let the Reader note, firſt, that [of] is here raſhly put in betwixt Meſſenger & Sathan. Secondly he ſheweth his accuſtomed ſawcines, in reſtraining

to a part, that, which the text attributeth to the whole: as where Paul ſaith: The Angell Sathan did buffet him. E. G.
                ſaith, He did buffet his fleſh. His meaning thereby hee ſheweth ſoone after, for he would haue vs to vnderſtand by this prick and buffeting of Sathan, nothing but the outward humblings, and afflictions of Pauls bodie: which afterward indéed he reckoneth vp, as things wherein he made his profit and reioycing alſo. But what reaſons bringeth hée, that the place muſt thus be vnderſtood? Forſooth Becauſe Paul reioyced and tooke pleaſure in theſe his infirmities, which hee would neuer haue done, if they had been vices, and ſuch fleſhly infirmities as they ſpeake of. Firſt marke his words. [Such fleſhly infirmities as they ſpeake of] What may he mean by this think you? If you read the firſt page of his book, where he maketh a flood of ſlandrous ſpewings, to drowne (if it were poſſible) all the ſincereſt Preachers of the Goſpell in, you ſhall ſée, he would haue the ſimple take it thus, that our Preachers doo extenuate and hide the gréeuouſnes and ouglenes of the groſſeſt ſinnes in the world, with the nice and ſoft terme of infirmities: which is ſo open a lie as it bewrayeth, there was no feare of God before his eies. Now for his reaſon, if he will thus meane by infirmities, whoredom, drunkennes, oppreſſion, &c. We are ſo far from vnderſtanding them to be anie cauſe of Pauls reioycing (who was far from their infection) as that we denie, the temptations, luſt, and eggings of ſin, (which héere we take for the prick in his fleſh) or the buffets of Sathan (which

are, by his continuall ſtirring vp thoſe luſts of concupiſcence) yea or yet his infirmities indéed, (whereby he meaneth his weake condition, and neceſſarie ſubiection vnto theſe things) to bee anie true cauſes of his glorying: no more (if you remember well) then the law could be truly ſaidRom. 7. 5. 8. to be the cauſe of ſin, for that the naturall man was the more ſtirred vp to rebellion by it. And yet it is true that Paul gloried in his infirmities: not in reſpect that they were vncleannes in the ſight of God (for in that regard they humbled him, and kept him from being proud of his reuelations) but in reſpect that they were the waie that the Lord had choſen both to doo him beſt good, and alſo to aduance his own power by: for ſo he plainly expreſſeth it, when he ſaith, Therefore2. Cor. 12. 9. I glorie rather in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt might dwell in mee. And the diuine anſwere it ſelfe ſaid to him: My grace is ſufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect through weaknes. If beſide this refutation of his reaſon ſome require more, to the clearing of this place to our ſide, I wil adde two or thrée arguments moe out of the text it ſelfe, to proue Pauls infirmitie in this place, to be a ſinful weaknes, and not the outward pouertie, reproches,verſe. 10. perſecutions, & anguiſhes for Chriſt, which he afterward remembreth. Firſt, becauſe thoſe can bee vnderſtood but of a bodely or outwarde weaknes, but by this is ment a ſpirituall or inward weaknes, which I proue by the very cauſe of this weaknes, which is the prick there mentioned, which being no outward thing, but inwardly

faſtened in the fleſh (for ſo y• text giueth)
                  
                     •••
                  ſc. 7. hath his proper effect, not in outward abaſing of the perſon in the eies of men, (for that doo thoſe things that come to him from without) but for that it inwardly reprocheth, ſtraineth and ſo abaſeth him in the eies of the Lord. Herehence I gather my ſecond argument, in that this weaknes was ſuch as humbled Paul in the ſight of God, ſo, as though he had the comforts of excellent reuelations, yet he durſt not boaſt himſelfe by them, for the priuitie of his inward vncleannes, which hée knew was open vnto the eies of the Lord. Now we know there is nothing in the worlde can make vs hang downe our heads before our God, but ſin only: for concerning all outward perſecutions and anguiſhes, wée haue a recompencing comfort and ioy in the preſence of our God, euen in the mids of their enduring, ſo as in them, we are more then conquerours:
               Rom. 8. 37. as the ſame Apoſtle teſtifieth in another place. Therefore it muſt néeds bée vnderſtood a ſinfull infirmitie, which Paul there acknowledged in himſelfe. My third argument I take from that, that the Apoſtle prayed ſimply for the remouing of it, which, becauſe it cannot be confirmed, by a like example in all the ſcriptures, naie, is plainly diſallowed by the practiſe of the Apoſtles. Act. 5. v. 41. And by Paul himſelfe likewiſe in ſundriePhil. 2. 17. Col. 1. 24. places, it proueth ſtrongly that outward afflictions maie not be vnderſtood thereby, but that ſinful weaknes, which euen then remained in him. And ſo thus we ſee, this place wel agréeing with the former of the 7. to the Rom. And to proue the

queſtion of the regenerate mans weaknes, equally with it. Againe for further proofe of thatDeut. 19. 15. queſtion, (becauſe by the word of two or thrée witneſſes a matter ſtandeth firme,) there is added vnto theſe a third place, out of the Epiſtle to the Galathians, in theſe words, The fleſh luſtethCap. 5. 17. againſt the ſpirite, and the ſpirite againſt the fleſh, and theſe are between themſelues contraries, ſo as you cannot doo whatſoeuer you would. E. G.
                fearing y• light of this place, would faine if he could, at leaſt, make our eies dimmer in ſéeing it, and thus he anſwereth: The fleſh indeed will luſt in all men againſt the ſpirit, but that it ſhall ſo preuaile againſt the ſpirite in the regenerate man, that he ſhall not be abled by the ſpirit to do the things he would, that I deny. An anſwere not only falſe but frantick. Falſe (I ſay) two waies: firſt in that he ſaith, The fleſh will luſt in all men againſt the ſpirit, as though all men had the ſpirit. Secondly, in that hée benieth That it can ſo preuaile againſt the ſpirit in the regenerate man: as though he that hath the ſpirit of God is not a regenerate man. Surely me think this geare hangeth togither like the words of a frantike man. But here (I trow) he bringeth ſome reaſons, let vs giue eare vnto them. Firſt (ſaith he) The Apoſtle biddeth
               verſe 16. 
               vs walke in the ſpirit, and then wee ſhould not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh (or we ſhould not leaue vndone the good we would.) Then he ſheweth the inconuenience
               verſe 17. 
               which would follow, if wee did not walke in the ſpirit, that is, the fleſh then would force vs to leaue vndone the good which God commanded, or the good we would: Thirdly and laſtly he ſheweth, that if we
               
               be not thus led by the fleſh, but by the ſpirit, wee ſhall not then be vnder that law of ſin, which maketh vs
               verſe 18. 
               leaue vndone the good we would. Well, let vs firſt try his fidelitie in the text, & after that ye ſtrength of his reaſon. For of trueth in all theſe wordes here, as his follie is miſerable, ſo his vntrue dealing with the text is damnable. In the 16. verſe, beſides that he foloweth the worſer tranſlations which are read thus, Walke in the ſpirit, and then you ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh, whereas it is righter thus: Walke by the ſpirit, and fulfil not the luſt of the fleſh. Beſides this (I ſay) which ſomewhat bewrayeth his euill hart, he is ſo impudent, as to adde ſuch a paraphraſe, as vtterly corrupteth the text it ſelf. It is in his parentheſis (Or we ſhould not leaue vndone the good we would) he wold haue ye reader vnderſtād, that not to performe the luſts of the fleſh, is as much as to doo that good that we would. But there is great difference betwixt them. For not to performe the luſts of the fleſh, is to ſtaie the accompliſhing of ſuch ſinnes outwardly, as our luſts doo inwardly ſolicite vs vnto. But to do the good we would (if it be taken according to Pauls meaning) is not only to abſtaine from the actions of ſin, (which is but the firſt ſtep of ſanctification) but to bring to paſſe all good that wee would in our conuerſation of life. Now the regenerate man hauing his affection ſanctified by the ſpirite of God, approueth & willeth all the law of God:Rom. 7. 18. therefore by this mans expoſition, he ſhould bée able alſo to performe al ye law of God. In which point he is not only Antichriſtian, and therefore

a lier: but one that contumeliouſly (as it were) to his téeth, withſtandeth the ſpirit of God: whoGalat. 5. 1

                in the next verſe ſaith flatly, Wee cannot doo whatſoeuer we wold. In this 17. verſe, giuing the ſenſe of it, he is yet (if it were poſſible) more ſhameles: for hee deliuereth it, as though Paul ſhould ſay (in effect) theſe words vnto the Galathians: [For if you doo not walke in the ſpirite, the fleſh then will force you to leaue vndone the good you would] The reaſon that moued him to make this ſenſe of Pauls words is this, That the Apoſtle there reaſoneth from an inconuenience. I anſwere, firſt, whenſoeuer the literall ſenſe may ſtande with the proportion of faith and cōſent of other ſcriptures, there it is to be followed and preferred, (for otherwiſe it muſt argue a iudgement ſtained with ſome corrupt preiudice) but of this place, the literall ſenſe is both agreeable to faith, and the other ſcriptures, V. petition. Ia. 3. 2. 1. Io. 1. 8. 9. 10. Cap. 2. 1.  which euerie where teſtifie that the elect doo ſin, and therefore cannot doo the good they would: (for it is certaine that the elect doo deſire Pſal. 119. v. 101. 104 112. 128. 159. 174. to walke in all the lawe of God) therefore ought the literall ſenſe in this place to haue béen followed. And ſo Paul ſhould haue béen heard, (according to the euident meaning of his owne wordes,) not enforcing his exhortation to the Galathians, by a reaſon taken from the inconuenience that might follow (as this man fooliſhly fableth,) but by an argument of compariſon from the leſſe to the greater, and that in this ſort. They that by reaſon of ſome ſtrong enemie in themſelues, cannot attaine to doo euen whatſoeuer in ye rightnes of their mind

they would, haue cauſe to labour ſo much the more, to follow the ſpirit, and forſake the waies their fleſh ſtirreth them vnto in all things: but ſuch is your condition, by reaſon of the ſight betwéene the fleſh and the ſpirit, two mere contraries, and therefore you haue ſo much greater cauſe to take heed to this exhortation. Now as you ſee this argument lyeth plaine according to the literall interpretation, (which euerie wiſe interpreter firſt ſtriueth to attain to, ſo far forth as he may,) and containeth doctrine, not onlie agreeable to the ſcriptures, but alſo verie notably making for the purpoſe of ye Apoſtles exhortation, ſo on the other ſide, if we ſhould ſtand to the expoſition of this miſerable man, firſt, the ſenſe muſt he ſuch, as neuer a word in the text giueth countenance vnto, (as is manifeſt by cō
               paring it with his expoſition.) and then ſuch a point of doctrine ſhalbe ſet downe, as is vtterly without rime or reaſon (as they ſpeake): yea ſuch a reaſon ſhall the Apoſtle perſuade the Galathians withall (which is a horrible thing to grant) as is fooliſh, abſurd, and one part of it ouerthrowing another. And this is it, woorthie for euerie man to looke vpon. When he had firſt w

               For if you do not walke in the ſpirit, the f
                     ••
                  ſh will force you to leaue vndone the good you would. How fooliſh and vnſauerie is this? to ſay, If you will not walke right, you ſhall bee forced not to walke right: I neuer heard that a willing minde néeded forcing. But

O how far from the Apoſtles ſpirite? who when he would reaſon from the end, or (as this man ſaith) from the inconuenience of a thing (as in other places hee doth) ſetteth another maner of edge vpon his argument, as for example, and euen in the verie like caſe, in the 8. of the Epiſtleverſe. 13. to the Romanes: exhorting to forſake the fleſh, and follow the ſpirite, among other arguments he hath this: For if you liue according to the fleſh you ſhall dye, but if by the ſpirite you mortifie the actions of the bodie, you ſhall liue. He can not make vs belieue therefore, that Paule was ſo rude a workeman as hee pretendeth. Now, in that I ſaide one part ouerthroweth another, I ſuppoſe there is none ſo ſimple as ſéeth it not: or cls I pray you, what good willeth he, that walketh not in the ſpirite? May not a man as eaſilie make a rope of ſand? Thus much for the 17. verſe, let vs looke if anie better ſpirite led him in the 18. the text is this: But if you be led by the ſpirite, then are you not vnder the law. He deliuereth it thus: If we be not thus led by the fleſh, but by the ſpirite, wee ſhall not then be vnder that law of ſinne, which maketh vs leaue vndone the good we would. In the ſecond page of his booke, he would make vs belieue that our miniſters haue a ſinguler fleight in peruerting the ſcriptures: I perceiue he dreamed of his own diſeaſe, and ſo when he wakened, told his dreame of others. For is not this very ſleight and cunning conueyance, vpō this text, in ſtead of the law of cōmandements, to profer vs ye remnant of old Adam, yet remaining in the regenerate

man? but let thoſe admire him whoſe eies he hath bemiſted. They whoſe eyes the Lord hath opened to ſée, may rather wonder at his impudencie, then be deceiued by ſuch ſhifting. If the ſcriptures could haue lent him but one example for this word [law] being ſimplie ſet down (as it is here) without anie word of reſtrainte accompanying it, to haue meant the law of the members, he might haue had ſome warrant of this his dealing. But a rubbed forehead, that can not chaunge colour, maketh a hold tongue to vtter anie falſhood. Before (if the Reader do remē
               ber) whereas we reade in the 1. verſe of the 8. ch. to the Rom. There is now no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt Ieſus. This man exp
                  •
               undeth the word [condemnation] by the bodie of death, which Paule ſpake of before in the 7. chap. & 24. verſe. Here he can make the word law ſound the remnant of ſin or vnregenerate part, which Paule in that place alſo to the Rom. termeth the law of ſin in his members. Now if it bee lawfull for a man, to vſe this libertie, namely to interprete termes of ſcripture, onely for his own turne, both taking them from their manifeſt ſenſe, and yéelding no proofe thereof by conference of other places, then is there no hereſie in the world ſo foule, as the diuel in his members, cannot find ſhift inough to maintain, by colour of ſcriptures. This conſidered, my anſwere might be ſufficient, if I barely denyed his fooliſh fiction. Yet becauſe his friends ſhal know that I ſtand by the heape of trueth, I will not ſpare, in anſ

               ring, to fill his meaſure full. To

the diſproofe therefore of his ſenſe, let vs firſt remoue the doubtfulneſſe of his ſpeach, and after that the falſhoode. The doubtfulneſſe is in theſe wordes [we ſhall not then be vnder the law of ſin] if he vnderſtand here, ſuch a being vnder, as is a willing lying downe, and ſubiection thereunto, which Paule forbiddeth, and is onely true in theRom. 6.

                  . vnregenerate, then this makethnothing for him ſelfe, nor againſt our aſſertion, though we granted him this meaning of that place. If ſo be then we take it to meane (as neceſſity enforceth) that as manie as are led by the ſpirit, are no more ſubiect in anie reſpect, to the remnants of ſin, but that they may do whatſoeuer good they would: then this can not bee the ſenſe of that place, becauſe it is flat contrarie to the Apoſtle both in the verſe afore going: (which I hope is clearely euicted from the aduerſaries ſenſe) as alſo in the 1. verſe of the 6. chap. where Paule plainely graunteth, that euen they that haue the chiefeſt meaſures of ſpirituall graces, may alſo be taken tardie in offences. Wherefore, if this mans minde had not béene foreſtalled with corrupt opinions, which like the worſt melancholie, turneth euen thoſe things that be verie cō
               trarie in their owne nature, to the féeding and maintenance of it ſelfe, hee might haue found ſuch a ſenſe of this place, as had beene both ſutable to that exhortation the Apoſtle maketh to the Galat. as alſo well according with euerie point of doctrine, which anie where els he teacheth: namely, that thoſe that are led by the ſpirite, are not vnder the law, as touching the guilt

and condemnaiion thereof, as Rom. 8. 1. in in which reſpect it is deade, Rom. 7. 6. and wee are no more ſubiect to it. Rom. 6. 15. and hereby the Apoſtle vtterlie remoued all ſcruple of wa

The reſt, from the 19. to the 21. verſe, being but a diſtribution of the effectes of the fleſh, and making nothing at all for his interpretation of the 17. verſe (which is the queſtion) is therefore idlely here brought in of E. G. to fill vp roome. As for the end of the fruites of the fleſh, there ſet downe, to wit, that Adulterers, Idolaters, drunkardes, gluttons, &c. ſhall not bee heires of the kingdome of GOD, it hath beene of our part ſo firmely alwaie belieued and taught, that the Church of GOD neuer needed the life of E. G. nor of anie ſuch tumultuous ſpirite, on this blaſmous manner, to vrge it. Thus hauing gained this place alſo to our cauſe, the proud building of frée will, and Anabaptiſtical holines, which he fooliſhlie raiſed thereupon, is fallen, and there appeareth therein, foundation for nothing els, but the humble habitation of Gods children, not onely outwardlie laide at with the ſtormes of worldly calamities, but moſt of all, inwardlie aſſailed with the buffeting temptations of Sathan, and rebeilious affections of onr owne remaining nature, as that although wee watch, and labour againſt them all the dayes of our life, yet ſhall we be neuer, in this life, vtterlie rid of them, nor yet in ſuch caſe, of abilitie, as

alwaies, and in euerie thing, to preuaile againſt them. And therefore in this reſpect, is our redemption obſerued, to be twofold: the one from the curſſe Col. 1. 13. 14. Gal. 3. 13. Rom. 6. 22.   of the law, and ſeruitude of ſinne, (which held thereby) the other from the Rom. 8. 19. 21 22. 23. 24. Ephe. 1. 14.coruption of our bodie. The firſt fréeth vs from the rule and iuriſdiction of our corrupt nature, the ſecond from the verie corrupt nature it ſelfe. By meanes of the firſt we are ſo deliuered from our ſinfull nature, as that, we yeelde no more willing obedience therunto, (it hauing no right ouer vs) but do wage continuall battaile againſt it, ſo as, though it ſometimes get the vantage & preuaile, yet we alſo manie times haue victorie ouer it. But by the other, we ſhall haue ſo full and cōplet deliuerance, as that neither anie corruption at all ſhall be left vnto vs, nor yet anie other aduerſarie, that now (by meanes of it) take part againſt vs, to annoy vs. Finally the benefit of our firſt redemptiō, we enioy with great comfort, in this life, (as thoſe that being anoyed, yet can neuer be taken anie more, or ſpoiled of our aduerſary) but the ſ

Out of all which, ſtanding on the naturall ſenſe, of the verie worde of God, what appeareth clearer vnto vs, then theſe concluſions? 1. That the regenerate hath not whileſt this life endureth, full freedom of his will. 2. That he ſinneth manie times.
            
            But now E. G. fearing leſt his naturall man would not be entertained of vs according to his ſpeach, hetherto giuen out in his recommendation, ſéeketh colour to enter his ſuite againe, by moſt vntruely charging our miniſters (and that without offering anie proofe) to teach, That the inner man of the regenerate is the ſpirite of God. Which I can not thinke he did, as hauing receiued it, either by ſpeach, or writing, from any of account, on our ſide, but becauſe the Adamant rockes of frée will, and mans abilitie had ſuch power to worke his ſhipwracke, and therefore he laboureth, not onely to ouerthrow our ſuppoſed opinion, of the inner man, but alſo aboue all, to eſtabliſh the naturall man, with as manie prerogatiues as we giue the regenerate man, concerning a ſanctified life, that ſo by that meanes, his regenerate man might ſit aboue the Stars, & attain to that in this life, which we haue no promiſe for, but in the life to come. In anſwering whereunto (I hope) manie wordes will not bee looked for, (though he in this point be larger then ordinarie) partly becauſe, I may not follow his humor, where he fighteth with his ſhadow, and partly alſo, for that I haue alreadie, ſet out the

full proportion of the naturall man, according to the ſcriptures. Firſt therfore in a word, to ſatiſfie the Reader concerning the falſe reporte of this man. We are taught, and do receiue it from the euidence of the word, that the inner man, is the whole man, ſo farre forth, as he is borne againe of God, and wrought vpon, and renewedRom. 7. 22. Ephe.

And this latter is according to his contrarie condition, called the outward man, which Paule ſetteth out, Rom. 7. 23. by the terme of the other law in his mēbers: whereby we vnderſtand, euen the whole man, inſomuch as he is borne, corrupted and depraued from Adam. Which diſtinction the ſcripture obſerueth likewiſe in other places, Rom. 6. 6. Col. 3. 9. 10. Eph. 4. 22. 23. 24 by the termes of New man, and Old man. E. G.
                chalengeth theſe partes, as the natural mans right, in common with the regenerate, and putteth this for difference, that the regenerate hath moreouer, beſide the inwarde and outwarde man, the ſpirite of Chriſt. Should I ſay, this is ſtrange ſtuffe, and hetherto vnheard off, in any ſound congregation? I ſhall moue thoſe of his ſpirite, nothing at all; nay, (I feare me) they take pleaſure in

walking alone, making to them ſelues an Idoll of their owne conceipt, and ſo their reioycing is naught: but I will ſay this by the grace of God, and make it good, that the worde of the Lord alloweth no ſuch diuiſion for his naturall man, and therefore he ſhall not enioy. What therefore bringeth E. G. to proue y• natural man to conſiſt of theſe two partes? Firſt becauſe, whereas the holie Ghoſt doth bid the naturall man to caſt off the old man, he doth there plainely diſtinguiſh betweene the naturall man, and the old man. The place that he citeth for this, is the 4. off the Epiſt. to the Ephe. and 22. verſe: whereupon as though it were cleare for his cauſe, he preſumeth to interpret the meaning of that ſpeach [the old man] for his purpoſe, namely that by it is meant nothing els, but the old, and wicked conuerſation and life, of the naturall man. But his reaſon is apparantly falſe, and his concluſion heretical. That his reaſon is falſe, euerie man ſeeth, that can read the 1. verſe of the Epiſtle to the Ephe. vnleſſe E. G. preſuined ſo farre, of his ſinguler cunning in conuaying, that hee could bring his naturall man, into y• mumber of the true ſaints, and faithfull ones, whom the Apoſtle called vppon in that Epiſtle, to put off the old man. If one ſay, there were hipocrites among them, not regenerated, I ſtriue not therein. But then they muſt obſerue withall, that, which I wiſh E. G. could haue conſidered, in all the Apoſtles writings. Namely, that in regard of this mingling, whileſt they exhort, they write that vnto all, which can in déed take place but in the truelie
            
               ſanctified. And againe in dehorting, they write manie things vnto all, which can ſimply be verified but in the hipocrites. And yet both theſe courſes haue due effect, in both theſe ſortes of men. By exhortation, the hipocrites are made vnexcuſable, and by threatnings, the children of God are made more watchfull, as hereafter more largely. Now where he ſaith, The old man is nothing els, but the wicked conuerſation, and life of the naturall man. His breath is ranke of pelagian frée will, whileſt hereby, he inſinuatety, yea and the law of contraries conſtraineth him to ſay, that the new man, is the new and godly conuerſation of the naturall man. Which though it be an abſurditie hatefull inough, to all that are but meanely exerciſed in the ſcriptures, that the natural man ſhould thus be adorned with frée wil, yet it is ſo much more foule and odious in this man, as that he giueth the naturall man in this place, by conſequence of the oppoſition, ſome power, both of willing and doing good: and againe, within the ſpace of two leaues following, ſpoileth him of the latter vtterlie. So that he is not onely contrarie to vs in this caſe, but to himſelfe alſo: that he might agrée with no bodie. Another reaſon he would draw from theſe wordes of S. Peter, For of whomſoeuer anie man is ouercome,
               
               2. Pet. 2. 19. 
               to him alſo in ſeruitude is he addicted. Here
                (ſaith E. G.) the man that is in bondage, muſt needes bee diſtinct from his corrupt nature, to whom he is in bondage. And out of the word [ouercome] he gathereth, that there muſt néedes be a fight and reſiſtance, without which (ſaith he) there
               
               can be no conqueſt nor victorie. This is but vngracious dealing with the ſcriptures. Peter ſpeaketh not there, neither of a méere naturall man, but of ſuch, as had a calling and reckoning in the cō
               gregation of the faithfull, which becauſe they bare the eſtimation of fighting the Lordes battailes, together with his people (though it were but in their owne conceipte) if it had béene lawfull to haue dealt thus with compariſons, E. G. might yet haue ſéene, that it was not without cauſe, the Apoſtle afforded them ſuch a Phraſe as being agréeable to their own ſenſe, might the more notably conuince them in their cōſciences, of their moſt miſerable caſe. Eſpeciallie this being no new guiſe or vnwonted thing in the ſcrip tures: As namely where our Sauiour ſaith, I am come into the worlde to execute iudgement,Io. 8. 39. that they which ſee not, might ſee, and they which ſee might be made blind. Should we gather by theſe laſt wordes, that the Phariſes did ſée? We know that our Sauiour meant nothing les: for he ſaith of them flatly in another place, that they are blind leaders of the blind. Thus E. G. might haue ſéene, the holie GhoſtMat. 15. 14. ſometime, leauing the proprietie of ſpeach, to apply himſelfe to the ſenſe of thoſe, whom his reproofe ſhould moſt concerne, for the déeper impreſſion therof. But I muſt anſwere him moreouer, that this libertie of ſtretching compariſons is vnlawfull. For like as they that compare thinges together, reckon it ſufficient, that there bee proportionable agréement, in thoſe points, wherein the compariſon ſtandeth, although in

euery circumſtance, one be not like an other: ſo we muſt be wiſe, in reading, to vnderſtād, chiefly the ſcriptures: namely, to note, and receiue, the verie drift and point of the compariſon, and buſie our ſelues no further in the other partes of the ſame. Which rule, if E. G. had here known, or els obſerued, I ſhould haue had no cauſe in this place to note him for an encrocher vpon the ſpirite of God. For whereas the Apoſtle was to proue the falſe teachers, to be ſeruants of corruption, he doth it by an argument of equall effects, and notes of victorie, ſet out by a ſimilitude of martiall conqueſt: wherein the caſe is ſuch, that whoſoeuer is ouercome in fight, is diligent to apply himſelfe afterwarde, to ſerue his pleaſure that ouercame him. Now what is the drift of this compariſon? but to ſhew, by one proper note of both, that the ſeruitude is alike in both conqueſts. Wherby the carnall profeſſors might ſée, that howſoeuer they perſwaded themſelues of fréedom and libertie with the children of God, though they followed their luſts ſtil, making the Goſpel a protection of their looſenes, yet ſhould their daylie iniquities, in ſpite of their beardes, argue againſt them, that they are no leſſe the ſeruants of ſinne, ſéeing they occupie themſelues in the workes thereof, then we ſée them to appeare ſeruants of their conquerours, who apply them ſelues to do their commandements: and this the Apoſtle amplifieth in the next verſe, by a compariſonverſe. 20. of vnlike endes. Now hauing here the full purpoſe and meaning of the Apoſtle, what warrant haue we, to ſtraine the compariſen, to

make the circumſtances meete likewiſe? If it were warrantable for E. G. herehence to infer a reſiſtance, becauſe there is mention of a victorie: why might not another of as euil a ſpirite, and by the like libertie, gather, that a man ſeruing ſin aboundantlie, ſhall neuer be brought to death therby, becauſe we know, it is ſo by the law of armes, that he that yéeldeth his life, & his ſeruice to his conquerour, is accepted into grace, and neuer endangered anie more, ſo long as hee abideth faithfull vnto him? but that the error is infinite, that commeth by this maner of dealing with compariſons in the ſcriptures, this one example ſhall be in ſtead of manie others: euen the parable of the vniuſt Steward in the Goſpel,Luke. 16. 1. which, if a man of an vncleane ſpirite, ſhould come to handle, according to the ſeuerall partes of it, he might make plaine footing for manifeſt theft in the 8. verſe, and all kind of oppreſſion, and popiſh merits in the 9. verſe: and that cleane beſide the purpoſe of our Sauior Chriſt, who in al that parable, had ſimply this meaning, to ſhew that the care and prouidence of the children of God, touching the eternall life, is euen farre ſhort of the care that prophane worldlings haue in temporall things. Other circumſtances, of the particuler practiſes of the ſteward, in accompliſhing his forecaſt, are of no regarde in all the matter. Thus haue you all the arguments, this good patrone can bringe for his naturall man: which being poore two, and too too weake, yea falſe and fabulous, yet he is ſo fooliſh, as to caſt his plot out of them, and make diuiſions,

for the ſafe ſeating of him there, as in his naturall habitation: yea & that with ſound of trumpet (as it were) liking to bee contrarie to all others in the matter. But Solomon ſaith, The frowardeProu. 3. 32. are abhomination vnto the Lord, and ſhame taketh the fooliſh out of the way. Hisverſe. 3. 5. wiſe collection of abſurdities, with his lying reports oft repeated, & other railings, I willingly paſſe by, as thinges that eſcaped him, immediatly vpon his wakening out of that dreame, wherein he thought we had held the inner man to be the ſpirite of God. Where he taketh the inward man, both of the regenerate and vnregenerat perſon, but for the heart, minde, or conſcience, thus far equaling either, with the other, ignorantly, arrogantly, and without all ground of ſcripture, what ſhould I anſwere? let it goe for me, to the fulfilling of the meaſure of his follie. In the reſt of this diuiſion he hath promiſed to ſtand vpon two points. 1. To reconſile ſome ſcriptures which ſeeme at firſt bluſh to ſay the contrarie. 2. To ſhew what difference the holy Ghoſt maketh betweene the inner man of the good, and the inner man of the bad. In the firſt his ignorance is wofull, and in the latter his impudencie wonderfull. His [ſome ſcriptures] fall out to bee but one place, and that not the moſt pregnant for this purpoſe: for where the queſtion is, whether the naturall man bee endued with an inwarde man, he bringeth that place to the Cor. which1. Co. 1. 14. denyeth the naturall man to be able, to perceiue the thinges that be of God: which though it bee mightier againſt him, then hee or his can euer

anſwere, yet becauſe it concerneth knowledge chiefly, and toucheth not the affection directly, it appeareth he was willingly, and therefore wofully ignorant of all other places, which cut the combe, and ſpoile all the powers of his naturall man, concerning the righteouſnes of God. Sufficient of ſuch places, haue I ſet downe before, where I haue done the naturall man his right. But now ſith E.G. hath brought out this place as eaſieſt for him to anſwere, let vs ſée how well he will auoide it. The argument it afordeth, is of this ſorte: he that is not able to vnderſtand the ſpeciall righteouſneſſe of God, is much leſſe able to will it, but the naturall man is not able ſo much as to vnderſtand it, therefore much leſſe to will it. I meane by ſpeciall righteouſneſſe the ſpeciall forme thereof, which God propoundeth vnto men: which is the ſenſe of this place to the Corinthes, agréeable to the 17. verſe of the 1. chap. of the Epiſtle to the Romanes. For otherwiſe, we know, the Apoſtle alloweth the prophane Gentile, to haue a certaine generall notion, and vnderſtanding of God and his law, butRom. 1. 19. 20. 21. c. 2. 15. becauſe it is not, nor can not bee, according to Gods preſcribed rule, (yea though that rule bee amongſt them,) therefore is it ſaide alſo, to be enemitie againſt God. As for the argument, E. G. belike ſaw it not: for he anſwereth neuerRom. 8. 7. a worde. But to this text of the Corinthes, he oppoſeth a place of the Romanes, where the naturall

                  h. 2. 13. man is ſaid to haue the law writen in his heart. Out of which two places, he would faine reſolue, that the naturall man knoweth, and approueth
               
               the commandements of God, according to the rule of his will, but onely lacketh abilitie to walke in them. Abilitie being the verie difference betwixt the regenerate and him. And hereupon without anie more labour of reconciling places, he leapeth into his ſecond point, being gladlie ridde of the former. But haſt maketh waſt & accompanieth daunger. Two places of ſcripture, that by wordes ſéeme contrarie, can not be eaſelie or vndoubtedly reconciled, without the thréed of a third place (at the leaſt) to ſowe them together. And that third place, muſt not be the word of a man, but the word of God. For he, that ſhall péece his owne wordes, vnto the wordes of the liuing God, ſhall haue the plagues added vntoApoc. 
                     •
                  2. 18. him, mentioned in the word of God. Yet E. G. in reconciling theſe places, deliuereth his owne ſenſe, without teſtimonie of other ſcripture for the ſame. Therefore he can not be excuſed of preſumptuous and wicked dealing therein. Againe, call you that reconciling, when the ſentence of reconciliation it ſelfe directlie fighteth with one of the textes? Truely it is like, as if a man pretending to part a fray, ſhould ſet vpon one of the parties himſelfe. But it is manifeſt, that E. G. reſolution of theſe two places, ſtandeth directlie againſt the place of the Corinthes, as appeareth both generallie by the whole drift of the chapter, and perticulerlie by the reaſon S. Paule there rendreth, while the naturall man can not vnderſtand the thinges that be of God: to wit, becauſe they haue a ſpirituall vnderſtanding in them, which the naturall man can not

reach vnto. Now if E.G. ſenſe ſtand, that the naturall man hath the ſame knowledge, with the regenerate man, then is the Apoſtles reaſon quite ouerthrowne. Therefore it appeareth, that E.G. hath here reconciled no places at all. And now that his foile is apparant in this, I will procéed to buckle with him in the next. You know he promiſed to ſhew, what difference the holie Ghoſt maketh, betwene the inward man of the good, and the inward man of the bad. Let vs attend vnto him, though he haue thereby, enlarged his queſtion, frō the naturall man, to the vnregenerate. The difference he putteth thus, that whereas the vnregenerate man, miſliking euil, and deſirous to will and to do that which God commandeth, wanteth notwithſtanding ſtrength, either to will or doe anie thing that good is, according to the commandement: the regenerate man, hath that ſtrength added to him by the ſpirite of God, ſo as he can both will, and do that which God commandeth, though fleſh and blond ſtriue neuer ſo much againſt it. Let vs diuide the partes, and examine them a ſunder. Who ſéeth not, that all the drift of E.G. in this ſection, is to able his naturall man, to ſay as much, as S. Paule ſaide in the 7. to the Romanes, when he ſaid, To wil is preſent withverſe. 19 me, but to performe that is good, I attaine not to. &c. to the ende, he might prooue that Paul ſpake that, but concerning his eſtate before he was regenerate, and therefore hath he all this while, béen buſilie blewing in the face of his naturall man, to fill him as full of an inner man as he coulde, but now when wee come to trie him

by his ſpeach, he ſaith he woulde both will & doe, but he hath no ſtrength either to will or doe: whereasRom. 7. 15. the regenerate man in a true meaſure willeth to doo the commaundement of God in the perfecteſt maner: ſo that we ſée this is but a raſhe Ephraimite, who ſtammeringly pronoūceth ſiboleth,
               Iudge. 12 6. for ſhiboleth, therefore hee muſt néedes haue here the rewarde of a conquered Ephraimite, that henceforth wee be troubled no more with him. Wel, though he haue thus ouerthrown his own purpoſe, for his natural and vnregenerate man, yet he mindeth to make vp his loſſe, in the giftes of the regenerate perſon. For if hee might once furniſh him, throughly, with frée will, he would ſoone prooue that Paul was no regenerate man, when he coulde not doo the good hee woulde, His verie woordes are theſe: The inner man, minde or conſcience of the regenerate and righteous man, it hath ſtrength and ſufficiencie by the ſpirit of God, both to will and do that good which God commaundeth, though fleſh and blood ſtriue neuer ſo much againſt it.
            
            Firſt for his phraſe, wherein the conſcience is put to ye office of the members, not ſo ſtrangely as fondly, I will not take the vantage that I could: but referre it to his ouerſight, being perſuaded, that indéed hee ment thereby flatly thus much: to wit, That the regenerate man hath ſtrength and ſufficiencie by the ſpirit of God, both to will and doo that good which God commandeth, &c. To which purpoſe therfore he ſaith by and by afterward, That God hath often and plainly pronounced, that he is not the ſeruant
               
               of righteouſnes, or of Chriſt, but the ſeruant of ſin, and of the deuill, which committeth ſin with his members, and ſo ſerueth and obeyeth the luſts of the fleſh, vntill that Chriſt hath ſo looſed the works of the deuill in him, that he ſin not.
            
            Theſe two places ſet togither, ſhewe his meaning to be as I haue ſaid. Now is the regenerate man not only a mightie warriour, but a ſoueraign king, this latter place hauing clothed him with the robe of perfection, and the former, put the crowne of frée-will vpon his head. Why ſhould we not now make haſt to ſalute him, ſaying, All haile victorious king? But ſoft, that is a matter not ſo ſafe as you take it: experience telleth vs, that if there bee a prince ſet vp without right, not only he and his proclaymers, but all other likewiſe, that congratulate and are knowne to ratifie him with their voices, are in litle better caſe then traitors, and ſo ſhalbe eſtéemed and rewarded. And if the terror be ſo great in worldly caſes, what are we to feare in heauē
               ly matters, y• Lord our God being king of kings and a ielous God? It is beſt therfore, before we ſalute him king, to enquire of his right. This muſt he haue, either in himſelfe, or from another that hath power to giue it him. That he hath any ſuch right in himſelfe, by all the graces of his regeneration, the ſcripture euerie where denieth, as hath béen hither to proued. And here I ſaie moreouer: if the regenerat ſhould haue ſuch power and perfection in this life, he muſt either haue it at his new birth, or els ſhortly after it: ſo as there may be a manifeſt ſeaſon, wherin hee

may appear by his actions to be euen ſuch a one, becauſe E. G. maketh it here an eſſentiall & proper note, to know the childe of God by, [That he ſin not]. Now that he hath it not, vpon his firſt begetting by the ſpirit, the Apoſtles themſelues are a preſident, who whileſt our Sauiour walked with them, fell ſundry times, not only in vnſéemely behauiour worthie Mar. 9. 32. 33. rebuke (as wée in extenuating will ſpeake:) but alſo ſome into Math. 20. 20. Mark. 10 35. foule ambition, Peter into Math. 26. 69. groſſe deniall of his maiſter Chriſt. And if we follow them further, in their perfect ſtate, (when they had had the excéeding meaſure of the ſpirit poured vpon them, we ſhall find Peter a chief Apoſtle, to haue committedGal. 2. 11. ſuch a ſin in Antioch, as for which, our Sauiour had pronounced, that it ſhould be betterMath. 18. 6. for a man, that a milſtone were hāged about his neck, and he throwne into the midſt of the ſea, then to commit it. What Paul hath confeſſed of himſelfe, many places haue béen ſhewed. Iames ſaith (to quench the ambitious controlling of ſome opinionatiue brethren) In many thingsCh. 3. 1. 2. we ſin all. And Iohn confeſſeth vs all, & himſelfe yet ſinners, when he ſaith: If any man ſin, wee1. Io. 1. 1. haue an aduocate with the Father, euen Ieſus Chriſt the righteous. Yea theſe words of Iames & Iohn, freely acknowledging a ſubiection to ſin, without any reſtraint or limitation of time for y• ceaſſing therof in this life, doo at one laſh, cut off all ye intereſt of the regenerate mans full power & dominiō in this life. And beſides, when we conſider our daily prayer, which Chriſt our carefull teacher left all his ſaints to ſay, what ſhall wée

think of that, wée are therein commanded: euerie day to aſke for giuenes of our ſinnes? If wée be regenerate, ſo as we ſin no more, what néede we? If to ſtop vp this breach for E. G. any of his diſciples haue a liking, to bring in his popiſh diſtinction of veniall and mortal ſinnes, let them not ſpare. I could here bring it in, to make them bluſh, if it were poſſible, for I haue it written by his owne hand (as I am perſuaded) mentioning the conference betwéene M. Whitaker and him: but for that I know of what ſpirit they are, and am loth to looſe labour vpō written papers, I will not now ſtand vpon it. Thus firſt wee finde, that the regenerate perſon by no warrantable right in himſelfe, can take this title vpon him. But becauſe ſome men looke not vpon the right and worthines of a Prince, ſo hée haue the place by the forcible decrée of ſome mightie monarch that hath power to eſtabliſh him, let vs examine in like maner, whether this kingly cō
               dition of the regenerate man be by the will and appointment of the eternall God or no: for by the places I finde quoted, ſome ſuch thing ſe'emeth to haue béen by E.G pretended: and eſpecially his confident ſpéech declareth it, where hee ſaith, [This being proued & authoriſed by the word of God, &c. For the former part, that The regenerate man is able to doo what God commandeth, though fleſh and blood ſtriue neuer ſo much againſt him, hee coateth thrée places: The firſt is in the 2. Cor. 3. 5. in theſe words: Not that we are fit of our ſelues to thinke anie thing as of our ſelues, but that we are fit, it is of God. This

text teacheth vs plainly, that we are in no wiſeverſe 2. 3 to aſcribe any thing to our ſelues, no not in thoſe works, wherin our labor hath chiefeſt ſucceſſe, for aſmuch as there is not the leaſt thoughtverſe 5. of good, that riſeth in vs, that may in any truth be referred to our ſelues as the fountaine, but to God only. Wherehence we drawe theſe leſſons to carry with vs: Firſt that no man by nature, hath anie thing in him toward the ſeruice of God. Secondly, That wee muſt ſeeke to him for fitnes in euerie particuler ſeruice and dutie, and return the praiſe of the ſucceſſe therof, to him alone. Theſe things by the grace of God we ſée and learne in this text. Only, how the regenerate ſhould herehence be warranted, to haue full ſtrength to kéepe the law, this wee ſhall neuer ſée, ſo long as there is one hereticke vpon the face of the earth. His ſecond place is, Epheſ. 3. 16. where the Apoſtle prayeth for the Epheſians, That God would giue them euen for his rich glory ſake, to be mightely ſtrengthened by his ſpirit, in their inner man. The effect of the petition is this, that there might be averſe 16. continuing growth of their inward man, & enlargement of their knowledge in Chriſt, & theyverſe 18. verſe 19. euery way fulfilled, euen to the high meaſure that God hath appointed. This place therefore giueth vs this leſſon for our inſtructiō verie profitably. To wit, That no regenerate man, ought to ſtaie in anie meaſure of his gifts, but to labour and looke continually for the encreaſe of them. Which is ſo far of from enſtalling the regenerate man, in any kingdom of abſolute

power, as that with one hand it diſrobeth him of all perfection, and with the other, caſteth his glorious crowne of frée-will to the ground. For if encreaſe muſt bee ſought for continually, then is there no perfection in this life. And if no perfection, where is that ſufficiencie to doo the commandements? Miſerable is that caſe, when a man miniſtreth a ſword to cut his own throat withall. His third place is, Phil. 2. 13. For it is God that woorketh in you, both to will, and to do, according to his franke beneuolence. Theſe words preuented a certaine ſecret obiection or ſcruple, which might be in the mindes of the Philippians, vpon the vehemency of the exhortation which Paul made vnto them, concerning the accompliſhing of their ſaluation, in the 12. verſe. For, that they might not ſlothfully lye down vnder the burthen, as men out of hope and heart to go through with ſo great an enterpriſe, he putteth them in mind, that they haue it from the Lord, both to will, and alſo to be able to performe. Whereby they had to obſerue theſe two points. Firſt, that they had not the rightnes of their will of themſelues, but from y• Lord. Secōdly, that he was alſo diſpoſed to giue them abilitie if they ſought it. Which doctrine neceſſarily vrgeth this vſe therof: firſt humilitie and reuerence in all our behauiour. Secondly, carefull diligence, in continuall ſéeking of the Lord by praier, in euerie thing wee néed: he hauing verie well confirmed this laſt vnto them, by his own practiſe and example in the firſt Chapter. Where he had with feruent affection, praied theverſe 8. 9. 10.
               
Lord to giue them more and more abundance of knowledge and iudgement, and ſtill to clear the whole courſe of their life, vntill the verie day of Chriſt. Now to cōclude thus from the text, The regenerate hath full power to keep the commandements, becauſe the Lord dooth giue them both to wil and to doo, is not to deale truly with the word of trueth, but ſophiſtically to adulterate the ſame vnto the perill of ſoules. If that be ſound reaſoning, I may in like maner conclude thus: Whoſoeuer honoreth his father and mother, ſhal liue long in this life, becauſe God hath promiſed ſo, in his fift commandement. Againe it is ſaid of the righteous man: That whatſoeuerPſal. 1. 3. he doth, it ſhall proſper: therfore ſhall no vnproſperous ſucceſſe come to ante of his labors and endeuours in this life? And on the contrarie part (according to this mans faſhion) ſhal we condemne all for diſobedient children that die in their youth, or vnrighteous men, that ſow ſéede which commeth not vp againe? Nay, who is ignoraunte that albeit we reade in the newe couenaunt, manie promiſes of fuller words, then this, whereof is now the queſtiō, yet is not there performance to be expected or taken (touching 
                  •
               his life) abſolutely, or ſimply, according to the 
                  •
               ordes, but in a meaſure and diſpenſation onely. Examples whereof I will reach you one or two. Chriſt ſaith, Io. 14. 13. c. 16. 23. 
               Whatſoeuer ye aske the Father in my name, he will giue it you. Yet Paule 2. Cor. 12. 8. prayed often for a full deliuerance frō 
               
                  •
               he ſting of concupiſcence, and could not obtain. Againe he promiſed, that when they ſhould receiue

the ſpirit of trueth, Io. 16 13. 
               It ſhould lead them into all trueth. Yet we know they were not afterwarde without all errour in their practiſe, which appeared both in Act. 15. 37. 38. 39. 40. 
               Barnabas and Gal. 2. 11. 
               Peter. So likewiſe, Io. 14. 26. 
               The holie Ghoſt which my father ſhall ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things: proueth not an abſolute knowledge in preſent, to be giuen to the Apoſtles, neither indéed did they attaine vnto it while they liued 1. Cor. 8. 2. 
                     •
                  . Cor. 13. 9. 
                     •
                  . Cor. 12. 
                     •
                  . 11. here: but only in an ordered meaſure, according to the moſt wiſe diſpenſation of the God of ſpirites, the full performance thereof reſting to be reuealed 1. Cor. 13. 12. in that day, when they ſhould ſée the Lord face to face. And according vnto this proportion, we ought to vnderſtand that ſaying to the Philippians, That God worketh in vs, both to will and to doo: not that this woorke is full & abſolute, as E.G. pretendeth: but daily by meaſure, wrought in euerie of the children of God, according to the good pleaſure and diſpenſation of his will. Which thing he muſt likewiſe haue neceſſarilie ſéene, (if hee had not wilfully cloſed his eies) both by the contradiction of other ſcriptures to his ſenſe of this place, as alſo by the verie light of the wordes in the text it ſelfe. For it is not written, God hath wrought in you both to wil and to do: as though it were done alreadie) but God doeth worke (or bring to paſſe in you) both to will and to doo: as implying the worke to be but begun, and in doing in them yet. And this being well conſidered, is ſo far from mainteining a full fréedom of wil in the regenerat, to do the commandement of God.

as that it concludeth iuſt the contrarie: and ſo taking this proud crowne from his head, humbleth him againe vpon his knées, to beg daily of his heauenly father, new ſupplies of ſtrength, to fight the ſpirituall battels of continuall temptations. But the regenerate perſon muſt not only be content to depart with ye counterfeit crowne, which this fooliſh man had put vpō him, but euē tolaie by his robe alſo, & to put on his armour againe, acknowledging himſelfe to be yet ſubiect to the woundes, though not to the death of his aduerſaries hands. For where E.G. would perſuade him, that The ſeruant of God is ſo quite ſeparate from ſin, as that he is not to be reckoned the ſeruāt of God that doth ſin: what doth he but bewitch his ſenſes, with the enchanted cup of a falſe perſuaſion, that whileſt he thus groweth to ſome ſecuritie in his ſtrength, Sathan (as hée is a cunning pioner) might ſecretly vndermine his foū
               dation ere he be aware. For hée that ſuppoſeth himſelfe all ſtrong, groweth ſhortly to leſſe ſuſpition of danger (eſpecially ye Lord in his iudgement ſo ſuffering Sathan accordingly to vſe his cunning) who then dooth ſubtilly withdraw him ſelfe, and for a ſeaſon puts no more fire to ye darts of concupiſcence, that ſo, this man hauing many daies the glorie of the field, and thereby growne ſecure in the high conceit of his owne ſtrength, might haue at the length all childelike feare and trembling ſtolne out of his heart, and into the place thereof conuayed (no leſſe priuily then the Eaſt wind carieth the Caterpiller) the filthy influence of meritorious imaginations. Which if

they once drawe nouriſhment of life in the partie that they be able to moue, long time ſhal not paſſe, ere they leaue neither bud nor bloſſome of true religion in him. How far E. G. had the wofull experience of this, (and therefore how much it ſtandeth euerie man in hande to marke this point) let his miſerable fall euen in y• very foundatiō
               In his conferēce with M. Egerton, and in the latter end of his conference with M. Whitaker, propoundeth the ſame. teſtifie, whileſt this was a queſtion, which he ſtifly mainteined alſo, namely, That wee are iuſtified by faith & works, not by faith alone. Which things conſidered, I thought it my dutie, to giue this caueat to the church, that whoſoeuer thinketh himſelfe to ſtand in the number of the regenerate, might a freſh conſider himſelf, (eſpecially the daunger being thus openly ſet before his eies) that he be not carried away by this falſe ſeducer, leſt hée trie the manner of his wofull fall ſoone after. Neither think you that the places of ſcripture which he muſtreth here in the margēt, are anie leſſe for this matter, then after his accuſtomed maner, abuſed. The firſt place he pointeth vs to, is Ro. 6. 16. 19. thus it is read: Know you not, that to whom you apply your ſelues as ſeruants to obey, his ſeruants you are, whō you obey, whether it bee ſin vnto death: or obedience vnto righteouſnes? In ye 
               19. verſe, As you haue applied your members to bee the ſeruants of vncleannes and iniquitie, to fulfil iniquitie, euen ſo now apply your members to be the ſeruants of righteouſnes, vnto holines. Let the reader alſo conſider the whole Chapter, for his inſtruction: it reſiſteth the prophaneverſe 1. ſecuritie, that wicked men would take by

the doctrine of iuſtification by faith taught before, and proueth, that they onely are to glorie in the benefit of Chriſt, as hauing true faith, that walke now in newnes of life, & reſemble Chriſt,verſe 4. 5. in crucifying the old man, and liuing vnto God. Whereof he giueth moſt certaine notes, in theverſe. 11. verſe 11. words that E.G. hath cited. For as to occupie our ſelues in ſeruing, argueth a Lord or maiſter to whom we are adicted, ſo the works of our ſeruice muſt néeds proue, whom we haue takē our ſelues to: eſpecially there being in this caſe, but two maiſters to ſerue, to wit, ſin or righteouſnes, and their waies openly repugnant one to the other. Accordingly wherto, in 
                  •
               he 19. verſe, he exhorteth to apply their ſeruice vnto righteouſnes, all thoſe that hold the benefit of iuſtification by faith. Which, as all the world knoweth, we are daily taught, with great inſtancie & earneſt obteſtation, (and therfore E.G. to haue béen in this his abhominable inſinuation, impudent aboue all meaſure) ſo yet, this maketh not one mite for his purpoſe, to proue vs altogither frée from the power of ſin, but is ſtill his olde ſophiſtrie, (taking it ſimply, which is but in ſome meaſure or reſpect) to the great abuſing of his reader. His ſecond text, being the 9. of John, and 34. verſe, let the Chriſtian reader looke vpon it, and conſider the queſtion: further anſwere I néed not giue. The laſt two places are out of the Epiſtles of John: which indéed I perceiue were ſuch vnto him, as certain places of Saint Pauls writings are ſaide, of S. Peter to be, to the vnlearned2. Pet. 3. 16. & vnſtable. The places are theſe: Whoſoeuer
               
               abideth in him, ſinneth not, whoſoeuer
               1. Io. 3. 6. 
               ſinneth, hath not ſeene him, nor knowne him. He that committeth ſin, is of the deuil:
               verſe 8. 
               becauſe the deuil ſinneth frō the beginning. And to this ende is the ſonne of God reuealed, euen to looſe the works of the deuil. And againe: Hee that is borne of God, doeth notverſe 9. ſin, becauſe his ſeed abideth in him: neither can he ſin, becauſe he is borne of God. So alſo in the 3. Epiſtle and 11. verſe: Beloued, folow not that which is euil, but that which is good, hee that doeth well is of God, but hee that doth euil, hath not ſeen God. But where learned this man, in y• interpreting of ſcriptures to take the ſenſe of repugnancie? Els knew hée not, that euen the ſame Apoſtle ſaid a little before, If we ſay we haue no ſin, we deceiue ourCap. 
                        ••
                     . 8. ſelues, and there is no trueth in vs. Yea we doo a horrible thing, euen make God himſelfe a liuer?
               verſe 10. Either els, if he knew the firſt Chapter, why did he diſſemble this place in it? Or why did he not reconcile it with others, ſéeing it ſo manifeſtly gainſayeth the letter of the others? Hee could not. Or he would not. Therefore eyther way, a falſe prophet and ſeducer, euen in the groſſeſt kynde of impudencie. Conferre (beloued reader) the places togither, and read the firſt Epiſtle of Iohn, from the beginnyng of his quotations, thitherto, or (if thou wilt) vnto the end, and tell me, what ſpirit was in his eyes, that he could not ſee the Apoſtle in the third Chapter, to frame his ſpéech directly againſt ſuch, as hypocritically profeſſing fayth, gaue fréely themſelues in the

meane time to ſerue ſin, and liue in their olde wickednes. Eſpecially he being (as it were) led by the hand vnto it, not only by the 6. 7. 8. 9. and 10. verſes of the firſt Chapter, but alſo by the beginning of the ſecond, and all the third. A reaſon or two among many, ſhall heere ſuffice. Firſt, in that he fully acknowledgeth all ye faithfullCap. 1. 8. verſe 9. ones to ſin. Secondly, in that he promiſeth from the Lord pardon vnto vs, when we cōfeſſe our ſinnes. Thirdly, if it happen vs to ſin, thatCap. 2. 1. we haue Jeſus Chriſt our Aduocat. Theſe reaſons proue that the righteous may poſſibly fall into ſin, and yet not to be proued children of the deuill thereby: and ſo conſequently, that the Apoſtle ſpake not of all manner of ſinning in the places E.G. citeth, but only of that which is in a continuall courſe, and with a whole conſent of the heart. Which conſequence alſo may directly be proued, by the reaſon that hée rendreth, whyCap. 3. 8. he that committeth ſin, is of the deuill: to wit, Becauſe the deuill ſinneth from the beginning. Now his reaſon is of no force at all, vnleſſe there be hereby granted a reſemblance, betwixt the deuill and them, in the purpoſe & procéeding in ſin. Which if it be granted, then cannot this be ſpoken of the regenerate, (who haue the courſe of ſin broken) but only of the vnregenerate, who kéepe it whole ſtill: and who profeſſing faith, in an outward ſhew, are (neuertheleſſe) proued by their daily life, the children of the deuill, ſince they ceaſe not to ſin, nor apply not themſelues vnto the Commaundements of God, which thoſe that are truely borne of God

vndoubtedly doe.

God, who in his frée mercie, and chooſing will in Chriſt, hath giuen me the effectuall féeling of his fauor, ſealed vp in my heart the aſſurance of his euerlaſting loue, by his ſpirite, and hath made me worthie in Chriſt to fight in his ſpirituall battaile againſt ſinne, and in ſuch meaſure to preuaile, as that none liuing can iuſtly accuſe me, of any ſuch ſins, as E.G. ſaith our preachers do

maintaine, euen he (I ſay) knoweth that in no other reſpect, but onely in the earneſt deſire of your ſaluation, I do beſéech you, to returne vnto our Church againe, and to forſake that dangerous way, which that wilfull man hath ſet you in. For Chriſtes ſake, conſider whither you are running, and what will be the end of your race. Are you ſo earneſt, becauſe you would come to eternall life? Chriſt knoweth, my deſire is no leſſe then yours: and that for this cauſe, I am readie to laye downe my life at his pleaſure: and doe dayly deny my ſelfe of thoſe thinges, which might bee commodious to my preſent condition. But (beloued) I dare not goe with you, as you are now bent becauſe not only, danger is in the way, but euen the dwelling of death alſo, is the end thereof.

E.G. telleth you thus much in déed: but be not led by and by, after euerie word: for I will ioyne with you in this point, that if this one thing, among all his falſhoodes, be true, or ſtand vpon anie firme probabilitie, I will forthwith claſpe hands with you, and receiue all his other opinions. How I haue alreadie, ſo farre proued this accuſation of his, to be falſe, as that I haue taken away all the ſhewes of reaſons, he could bring for the ſame, you haue now heard in the former part of my anſwere. For the reſt, I will render you (here) an account of my faith (ſo much as concerneth this matter) as I haue learned it, at the féete of thoſe men whom he accuſeth.

companion of this repentance, is ſpiritual war,Rom. 7. 17. 20. 21. &c.

In this effect moreouer, we do conſider the action of his diuinitie, and of his humanitie. The action of his diuinitie is two fold: firſt, that by his ſpirite, he might ſupport our weakneſſe, and in our prayers, (when as we know not what toRom. 8. 26. 27. pray as we ought) might entreat for vs, with ſighes that can not be expreſſed, that is, might prompt vs inwardly, in our hart, according vnto God. The ſecond is, whereby hee being the ſearcher of our heart, knoweth the meaning of the ſpirite, like as he doth the imperfections and defilements of the fleſh. The action of his humanitie herein, is, to be touched with the Heb. 4. 15. 16. c. 7. 25. 26. 27. Exod. 28. 38. féeling of our infirmities, & for the ſame, to apply by his ſpirite, the merite of his death and obedience, whereby ſo, taking away iniquite, he maketh our obediēce accepted. Hetherto I haue declared how I belieue in Chriſt, concerning his Prieſthood, inſomuch as pertaineth to the preſent occaſion: now, as concerning his kingly office, meaſured by the ſame conſideration. His kingly office is the ſecond Eſai. 9. 6. 7. Zac. 12. 1
                     •
                  . part of his Mediatorſhip,

whereby he applying vnto his elect the effects of his Prieſthood, doth ſpiritually pſal. 2. 6. 7. &c Epheſ. 1. 21. 22. gouerne his Church, to the deſtruction of all his enimies, and to the perfect glory of all his childrē. The partes hereof are, his ſpiritual adminiſtratiō in this world, & the laſt iudgement. His ſpiritual adminiſtratiō in this world is, for the Eph. 4. 11. 12. 13. gathering together of his Church, & preſeruation therof, vnto y• laſt iudgement. This ſpiritual adminiſtration conſiſteth of an inward working, 
                  •
                an outwarde diuine gouerning: (whereof this place requireth no further ſpeach) the inwarde working or operatiō, is that part of adminiſtration, which is in the efficacie of the ſpirite, working inwardlie by the outwarde meanes of diuine pollicie, as preaching of the worde, miniſtration of Sacraments, &c. alſo this ſame inwarde operation is twofold: as tending to the fulfilling of the decrée of election or reprobation: both which againe are diuerſe in Act. 2. 29. 1. Cor. 7. 14. infants, and elder perſons. In infants, I vnderſtand the operation after this ſorte, when as outwardlie, that is as pertaining to the iudgement of the Church, they are holie, through the grace of the couenant, whereinto they are entred. And of theſe, 1. Cor. 12. 13. ſo manie as are elect of God, are after a ſecret and vnſpeakable maner, graffed into Chriſt, by the ſpirite of God. The Reprobate of them, are for the The 5. of Ro. ve. 12. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. with the 9. of Rom. from the

                  ••
                diſtribution

of gifts, and the kéeping and encreaſing of them. But this vocation we find to be twofold: one common to euerie ſorte, wherein both Mat. 1

                  . 41. 47 Ephe. 2. 19. reprobate and elect, are brought, as if they were a brotherhood, to one outward ſocietie of a church. But the other is the proper calling of the elect, 2. Th. 2. 13. 14. Ro. 8.

                   places before. wherby they are brought vnto election. Election is a Eph. before. & 17. ver. Ion. 15. 19. ſeperation of them from the world, to be citizens together in Chriſt, and of the houſhold of God. Their proper gifts are, faith vnfained, and the fruites of faith. Faith vnfained is a faith, whoſe facultie is altogether a Col. 2. 12. & 1. Theſ. 1. 3. with Eph. 3. 17. 20. cap. 2. 8. ſupernaturall efficacie, put into the heart, to the aprehending of Chriſt & the promiſe extant in him. The proper action hereof, (or as Paule ſpeaketh 1. Theſ 1. 3. the worke of it) is to take Ioh. 6. 29. 35. 47. 50. 53. 54. hold of Chriſt, and to receiue him applyed vnto vs: whereby he not onely dwelleh in our heartes, as it is in Epheſ. 3. 17. but is alſo put vpon vs, as a worthie clothing, like as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh Gal. 2. 27. The fruites of this faith are thoſe; which Gal. 2. 23. Ephe. 3. 17. 18 Chriſt worketh in his elect, dwelling in them by faith. The chiefe heades of which are, Rom. 5. 1. 2. 3. wt 20. 21. verſes. Rom 6. 1. 2. 3. Rom. 8. 1. 2. 3. 4. Rom. 12. 1. Gal. 2. 6. 7 8. 9. 10. 13. 14. 15. 16. 18. 19. 20. 21. Col. 2. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. reconciliation, and ſanctification, and ſo the fruites that reſpect or follow either of them. Fruites reſpecting reconciliation are the fruites of the ſpirite, which ſpring from the certaine applying of the ſame reconciliation. And thoſe are either reſpecting iuſtification, or adoption. Thoſe of iuſtification, are ſuch as like verie effects of a true cauſe, ſo do they declare the ſame iuſtification (for certaine) to be applyed vnto vs: ſuch as are they, which of the Ro. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Apoſtle are ſet downe in

their order: namely, an entrance into the fauor wherein we ſtand. The loue of God towarde vs poured out in our heartes, that is, by the excellent working of the holie Ghoſt, plē
               tifully imprinted in the ſenſe of our ſoule. The peace of our conſcience before God, ſpirituall gladneſſe, and glorying in theſe benefits. Now the fruites reſpecting adoption, are thoſe which do Gal. 4. 6. 1. Cor. 1. 21. confirme the ſame yet more certainely vnto vs. To wit, the

                   Ibid. & Ro. 8. 23. 24. Eph. 1. 13. 14. ſpirite of Adoption, & hope. The ſpirite of adoption (which is here a figuratiue ſpeach, the cauſe being put for the effect) is that working of the ſpirite of Chriſt, which Rom. 8. 15. 16. witneſſeth vnto our ſpirite that we are the ſonnes of God. Wherehence ariſeth that boldneſſe, that we Ver. 15. call God our father. And haue the Ver. 33. 38. 2. Cor. 1. 22. Ephe. 1. 14. certaintie of the inheritance, ſo as with a pledge, or earneſt pennie, confirmed vnto vs here, till we be brought to the full libertie, to the prayſe of his glorie. Hope which is the other fruite reſpecting adoption, is whereby from the certaintie of faith, we Rom. 8. 25. 1. Theſ. 1. 3. 10. Col. 1. 5. 23. expect with patience, all thoſe thinges which are to be fulfilled. This patience or waiting is, the Rom. 8. 25.

               demned, and by writing, laboured to make odious both to friends and enimies. So that it is more then probable, that the cauſe of the poyſon which he ſpeaketh of euery where ſo virulently, is not at all in our teachers, but in ſuch vncircumciſed hearers as E.G. was: who for lacke of an vnderſtanding heart and humble ſpirite, turned that into venome, which another man receiueth the permanent foode of life by. Neither is it maruel, that one and the ſame cauſe ſhould haue ſo contrarie effectes, through the onely diuerſitie of the ſubiects, or matters whereon it worketh, for nothing is more common in the whole courſe of nature. Let the ſunne be an example for all: which by one and the ſame ſhine of his beames, doth not onely ſoften the waxe & harden the claye, but alſo moſt comfortably fur▪ ther the ſprout of the fruites of the earth, and yet horribly encreaſeth putrefaction in all other thinges, that haue not the ſéed of life in them. His next diuiſion, framed againſt this doctrine

[that the holy Ghoſt meaneth him, to be the ſeruant of ſinne and of the diuel, who willingly with delight committeth ſin, not miſliking it, nor ſtriuing againſt it] partly is anſwered, (as his place of Peter) the reſt is not worthie a word of anſwere, in regard of the matter, being nothing but a heape of friuolous words, either quite from the queſtion, or els abſurdly begging the queſtion. Onely for the ſimpler ſort, I will take ſome occaſions that it offreth me, to laye abroad ſome pointes which (perhaps) the Reader might wiſh to be inſtructed in, for the further clearing of the controuerſie. Firſt for the doctrine (which hee putteth downe, with that poyſomous title, according to his accuſtomed lewdneſſe) I graunt it to bee ours: ſo it be rightly vnderſtood. Namely, that by the words, [miſliking] and [ſtriuing] be not vnderſtood euerie light pricke, or remorſe of conſcience, (which euen the wicked haue, not by cō
               trarie affection of their will, (for they ſinne with all their 1. Pet. 4. 3. 4. heart) but by the contradiction of their iudgement, which they haue by the light of nature, whereby they can inwardly Rom. 2. 14. 15. controll themſelues, in committing the groſſer ſins) but an vnfamed pſal. 97. 10.

As for his impudent inſinuation which in euery place he offreth, (as though we exempted groſſe continuing ſinners, according to his diueliſh accuſation, euen ſuch as make but an

hipocritical profeſſion of religion, from the number of the ſeruants of ſinne, and of the diuel) I will anſwere it no more, ſuppoſing his booke doth now bluſh alreadie thereat. But ſome will aſke, if the regenerat man do ſo hate ſinne as I haue declared, how it commeth to paſſe, that he can fall into ſinne at anie time. I anſwere, that it falleth out by reaſon of the vnregenerate condition that is in him: ſith (as I haue aboundantly proued) our inherent righteouſneſſe is, in this life, but begone in vs. And when I ſpeake of a beginning of inherent righteouſneſſe, I meane ſuch a beginning, as hath a dayly procéeding & encreaſe, euen as it is ſaide, from ſtrength to ſtrength. Which whoſoeuer féeleth not in him ſelfe in ſome anſwerable meaſure, to his graces receiued (I except onely the afflicted conſcience, during the ſtorme of affliction) let him not flatter himſelfe, he is not yet in the ſtate of the childe of God. And in this exacting of holie life, our preachers are ſo farre from being behind E.G. that he is not worthie to be named the ſame day they are. For he reckoneth it ſufficient, or to be out of the compaſſe of daunger, if we be able to abſtaine from ſuch groſſe ſins as hee babbleth off in euerie place, as though there were no other ſins to be ſpoken off els. But they make (in compariſon) ſmall reckoning of him, that hath but ſo farre preuailed: (for manie ciuile men, for other reſpects then the reuerend loue of God, are ſéene to abſteine from thoſe ſinnes) therefore do they alſo, with all inſtancie, p
                  ••
               teſt vnto vs, that we muſt reſiſt euen the firſt motions of ſin,

and goe into the field with our affections euerie day. And when they acknowledge the life of the regenerate, not to bee without ſinne, they ſpeake not that, either to deny good works, or that they thinke not the good workes of regenerate men to be pleaſing vnto god (wherby to dull our deſier and weaken our members to labour after them) but only to ſtoppe the way of preſumption againſt vs, and to make vs vnderſtand and ſée, our vncleannes and impuritie: to the perceauing wherreof we are blockiſh, and more then blynd. Here hence another queſtion ſemeth to riſe: namely whether the regenerate man can poſſibly fall into anie of the groſſer ſins. In a word, the examples of Dauid and Peter do anſwere yea. The euidence of which examples E.G. ſéeing ſo full againſt him, deuiſed this moſt vnlearned and prophane ſhift to auoid it: to wit, that when ſuch are ouercome of their corruption, and ſo commit ſuch ſinnes, they are deſtitute of the ſpirite of Chriſt, and looſe the grace of Gods children, or of their new birth and regeneration, vntil it be renewed againe in them by repentance. This is that monſter of often regeneration, which he made ſhew off before in his ſecond diuiſion. An egge verie worthie the crow that laied it. But let vs ſée, what he can ſay for it, why we ſhould ſuffer it to be hatched. Peters example he ſubtilly ouerſlippeth. But Dauid (he ſaith) did therefore praye diligently when he was ouercome of murther and adulterie, that God would renew a right ſpirite in him, or giue vnto him a new, a right ſpirite, & that he would not take his holie ſpirite from him:
               
               to wit, as he did, for the time hee was ouercome of thoſe two horrible ſinnes. And further he ſaith, alſo he prayed that God would giue vnto him a new and cleane heart, whereby we vnderſtand, that for the time, the grace of his new birth was loſt, and the image of God was wholy defaced in him. A heauie iudgement, that you had no better vnderſtanding. How groſly he abuſeth here the text, with his

               r the ſpirite of God: firſt, becauſe in the next verſe following, he maketh petition concerning the holie Ghoſt. Secondly the context and epithete leadeth, that Dauid by theſe wordes, required one ſpeciall effect of the ſpirite, to be wrought in his minde, namely, of ſtrength & firmitie, to be ſtedfaſt in the obedience of the Lord hereafter. The context I ſay ſheweth it: for the words are theſe: Create in me (O God) a clean heart, or (as ſome tranſlate) a cleane mind, and renew a firme ſpirite within me. Nothing is more ſutable, then when as the affections are cleanſed afieſh, that in the next worke, ſtableneſſe and conſtancie be added vnto them. But if there were no more, ſaue onely the nature of the word [renew,] it were inough to conuince this frenſie of often regeneration: for that argueth, that Dauid prayed not for ye thing, that hee was abſolutely without. The like ſhame receiueth his cauſe, in the next verſe: Caſt me not from thy preſence, and take not away thy holyſpirite
               
               from me. Dauid ſaw his offence ſo great, and ſo felt the terror of Gods diſpleaſure in his conſcience, that he was well-
                  •
               ere the doore of deſpaire, knowing that his ſins had deſerued, that God ſhould vtterlie withdraw his ſpirite from him. Whereupon yet he cryeth vnto him, that he would not: and therehence, he that is in his wits, muſt néeds conclude, that it was not. Laſtly, whereas vpon this petition [Create in me a cleane heart] E. G.
                gathereth, that therefore the grace of his new birth was loſt, & the image of God wholy defaced in Dauid, it muſt néeds be that the ſpirite of ſlumber had oppreſſed him. For who prayeth not for this vnto God, euerie day? And although Dauid had vnderſtanding of a greater foulenes hereby, then euerie man ordinarily in prayer hath, you ſee that is nothing to warrant this cōcluſion, which ſtandeth only vpon y• falſe principle, he that hath not a cleane heart, is not regenerate. Thus firſt you ſée, E. G. can ſhew no good reaſon, why his monſter of often regeneration ſhould be ſuffered to liue. Now will I, on the other ſide (by the grace of God) proue, that it ought of right, to dye. Firſt, I reaſon thus againſt it. Whoſoeuer hath one continuall abiding of ye ſpirit of God in him, hath alſo o
                  •
               e cōtinual ſtate of his regeneratiō, but ye child of God hath one cōtinual abiding of the ſpirit of God in him, (as is manifeſt in this example of Dauid) therefore he doth neuer any more become vnregenerate. Secōdly, they that haue both their entrance, & their ſtanding by mere grace, cannot be excluded by works, but y• regenerate haue both their Rom. 5▪

                entring & ſtanding in that ſtate by mere

grace, therfore their fallinges do not vnregenerate them. Thirdly, he that once falleth awayHeb. 10. 26. after he is enlightned can no more be reſtored: the reaſon is, becauſe there is no more ſacrifice for ſin, whereby he ſhould be reſtored: but, E. G. graunteth that the grace of the new birth may be loſt, and the image of God wholy defaced for a time, which is all one with falling away: it ſhould follow therefore, that ſuch can no more be reſtored by repentance. Which incōuenience I earneſtly requeſt this mans followers to marke. Laſtly, the baptiſme of water, is an argument y• our regeneratiō is but once wrought in vs: for therefore alſo is it (being the ſigne) but once to be added vnto vs. Whereas, if regeneration were to be twiſe or thriſe repeated, and wrought in vs, then alſo the ſame baptiſme muſt as oft be repeated and receiued of vs. Thus then we ſée, the trueth is, that regeneration once wrought in vs by the holie Ghoſt, is alſo continuallie preſerued in vs by the ſame, vnto the end. And that this mans doctrine of often regenerating is falſe, abſurd, and extreamely dangerous: and therefore ſuch a monſter, as all the louers of trueth, ought of duetie vnto God, laye violent handes thereon, that it may not liue. Like as he that hath once loſt his way, is readier (for the moſt part) to wander ſtill from it, then to hit vpon the right path againe: ſo in like maner, fared it with E. G. who hauing runne into the error of often regeneration, laboureth next to eſtabliſh it, with putting cleane 
                  ••
               t the ſpirite of Chriſt, in him that was once regenerate. And

therefore now he ſaith: It is manifeſt in the word of God, that if we be not ſtirred vp to take heed, wee may quench, & ſo put cleane out the ſpirite of Chriſt, we may fall away from the grace of God, we may deſtroy the temple of God, we may be broken off from the vine Chriſt Ieſus &c. Firſt let the Reader note, that the queſtion here, differeth nothing in effect from the laſt before handled. Which was, That the regenerate might fall from his ſtate of regeneration for a time: and ſo implyed an often regeneration in the ſaints. Which hauing now (by the grace of God) with ſound & cleare arguments, ſufficiently ouerthrowne, the force likewiſe of this muſt needes bee fallen together with it. So as there onely remaineth, that we examine theſe places of ſcripture, and ſatiſfie the Reader in thoſe thinges, wherein they ſéeme to make ſhew of doubtfulnes vnto him. It is writen 1. Theſ. 5. 19. Quench not the ſpirice. & Heb. 12. 15. Beware that none of you fall away from the grace of God. Againe, 1. Cor. 3. 17. If anie man deſtroy the temple of God, him will God deſtroy, and cap. 6. 15. Shall I take the members of Chriſt and make them the members of an harlot? alſo Ioh. 15. 4. Abide in me & I in you, as the braunch can not bring forth fruite of it ſelfe, vnleſſe it abide in the vine, ſo neither can you, vnleſſe you abide in me. Laſtly, in the 5. of Mat. & 13. verſe: If the ſalt haue loſt his ſaltneſ

                  e, &c. The concluſion E. G. maketh out of theſe places is, Therefore all theſe thinges may come vpon vs, to wit, wee may quench the ſpirite, fall frō the grace of God, &c.
               
Which concluſion (I hope) ſhall only ſhew this by and by, that this man was very wittie to beguile him ſelfe. But firſt we might lawfullie diminiſh the number of his places: for the firſt place of the Corinths, if it be tranſlated deſtroy the temple of God, the word [deſtroy] is to be vnderſtood as an exceſſiue ſpeach, comprehen

               inng the end of a carnall kind of preaching the Goſpel: not that Paule ſpake there, of any art, that ſimply had the force to deſtroy the temple of God in his children, but onely in reſpect of it owne nature (in which conſideration, euerie wicked courſe in the Church of God tendeth ſo much as it may, to the deſtruction of the whole: but God vpholdeth

For his queſtion is, of the depriuing of our ſelues of the true grace of God receiued, and this place ſpeaketh but of giuing occaſion to corrupt others. But admit this place goe for his purpoſe, let vs likewiſe receiue al the reſt of his word, without examination, and frame

               we may fall into them. I anſwere he muſt vnderſtand by the word [we] a whole congregatiō generally profeſſing the goſpel, ſuch as were thoſe to whom the Apoſtle wrote. And ſuch a one (I ſay) doth conſiſt of two kindes of men, which are called in the ſcriptures ſanctified, iuſtified, and elect. The firſt kinde, are in deed and tru

Of this ſort the 8. Rom. entreateth And theſe are properlie the Church of God. And for this number ſake, the reſt which are in the Church, as tares in the corne, are vnproperly and by a figure of the whole for a part, termed by the name and title of ſanctified and iuſtified ones. This is plaine by the Iſraelites, which though in deede, and in the ſight of God, they were not all ye people of God▪ yet we know, that all of them bare the name of the people of God. So Paule calleth all the Church of the Corinthians,

Againe, of theſe that beare a name with the beſt are two ſortes. One which hold not Chriſt our true righteouſneſſe & ſanctification, in their heart, apprehended by a true & liuely faith, & yet haue him not onely in tongue and outward profeſſion, but are beſides enlighned by the ſpirite of God, in their vnderſtanding,

and their iudgement ſo formed, as that in ſome ſorte, they Heb. 10. 29. 2 Pet. 2. 21. ſhew a kind of liking to reforme them ſelues, as if they were made partakers of the ſpirit of Chriſt, whiles that partly in words, partly in déedes, they will after a maner glorify God, ſhew Heb. 6. 4. 5. Mar. 6. 20. a certaine delight in the exerciſes of religion, with zeale and feare, and Gal. 415. reuerence towardes the Miniſters. But for all that, the ſeede taketh no roote in their heart, neither doth the ſpirite ſet any new ſeaſon vpon their affections: ſo that they are in trueth, before the Lorde, that ſéeth the heart, vnregenerate ſtill, what account ſoeuer they carry among men, or in the Church of God here militant. The other ſort of Hipocrites, attaine not ſo far, as to haue knowledge, and reformation in iudgement, much leſſe to reforme themſelues, or ſhew anie zeale or feare of God, but onely content to accompanie the Church in the outward profeſſion of Chriſt, and ſeruices of religion, according to that our ſauior ſaide to the Samaritan woman: you worſhip you know not what. NotwithſtandingIoh. 4. 22. becauſe this confeſſion of Chriſt, is vnto the Church an outward teſtimonie of ſome inward regeneration, (vntil there breake out of them, ſome manifeſt ſtubborneſſe, or open impietie) they are reputed with the reſt, regenerate, iuſtified, and ſanctified▪ Now of theſe two, there is no doubt, but that the dangers which the ſcripture admoniſheth of, may ſimply fall vpon them: and they become bereaued euen of that they ſéemed to haue: according to thoſe wordes of Chriſt: from him that hath not, euen that which he
               Mat. 13. 12.
               
               hath ſhalbe taken away. Alſo as cōcerning the truly regenerate, I grant, that in reſpect of their own ſtrength, they may fall away, ſo would I haue ſaide (if a certain meaſure or maner might haue been admitted) that they may quench the ſpirit, but to put it cleane out, or quite to fall away, is not in their power to will, much leſſe to doo. For their ſtanding is not of themſelues, but of the Lorde, not by their will, but by his grace, neither is founded vpon the ſand of their ſtrength, but vppon the rocke of his aſſured promiſe. Yet cannot heerehence bee concluded that then ſuch admonition ſhould bee giuen in vaine of the Apoſtle: for as the reprobate were thereby left vnexcuſable, ſo the elect were both ſtirred vp to a greater alacritie and circumſpectnes, (ſéeing the perill ſet before them and their own weaknes pointed at) as alſo gratiouſly exerciſed of the Lord, to worke togither with him, in the finiſhing of our Iud.

A father ſetteth his yoong ſonne on horſeback, and ſtayeth him thereon with his hande, that he ſhall not fall: yet while the horſe goeth, he ſaith vnto him, hold faſt (my childe) hold faſt for falling: although (I ſaie) the ſecuritie of the childe reſt in the fathers holding, (himſelf being euer readie to ſlip of, either on one ſide or other, not willingly, but through his weaknes) yet his admonitions are not in vaine, for they ſtill ſtir vp the childes deſire, and cauſe a further care of better practiſe. And this is a full anſwere, not onlie to theſe places of ſcripture, but likewiſe to

all others of like nature, that can be brought for this purpoſe: namely to the 11. of Rom. v. 20. which he alledgeth in the 9. diuiſion, and the 18. of Ezech. v. 24. with all the reſt that follow, to proue (if his aſtonied ſenſes had not failed him) That the holie Ghoſt doeth no where teach, the truly ſanctified ones to perſeuere in that eſtate vnto the end. For in all thoſe his teſtimonies & examples like as in theſe before, he either by groſſe vnſkilfulnes, or ſinguler maliciouſnes, ſeduceth his reader, with ſophiſticall deceits: as in the petition of the principle, both here and throughout his booke, taking it ſtill for granted, that we hold preſumptuous ſinners for elect and ſanctified: which is the chiefe thing he ſhould haue proued. Alſo taking wordes in one ſignification which haue diuers, as where men are called iuſt & ſanctified, that indéed are not ſo: and again, taking things as ſpoken ſimply, which are but in part, and in ſome reſpect, as where the Corinthians are feared to bee corrupted from the ſimplicitie that is in Chriſt, and the Galathians ſeduced, he vnderſtandeth them to be ſimply and altogither corrupted and ſeduced, which cannot be ſaid of the truely regenerate, but hath only place in the hypocrites and reprobate. Which becauſe E G. ſo proubly hath denied to bee the dectrine of the holie Ghoſt, let vs adde yet moe arguments vnto thoſe againſt often regeneration, that this trueth may plentifully appeare, to haue a ſurer foundation in the ſcriptures, then that all the hereticall ſpirites in the worlde can preuaile againſt it. And firſt of theſe, which he (after his

mad maner,) putteth down for our proofes, neither quoting place, nor naming his authour, I will make ſome (by Gods helpe) 
                  •
               oo hote for his handling. Firſt, none that are Chriſtes ſhéepe can fall away, Io. 10. 28. All that are truly ſanctified are Chriſtes ſhéepe, as appeareth by that whole Chapter: therefore none that are truelie ſanctified can fall away. E. G. ſtaggering at the blow, knew not what to ſaie to the argument of the place, but hunted for his anſwere in y• verſe going before it, where it is reade: My ſheepe heare my voice, & I acknowledge them, and they follow me. And what of this? Here (ſaith he) it is manifeſt, that Chriſt hath elect and choſen, only ſuch to be his ſheepe, which heare his voice, and obey his word, and ſo follow Chriſt in their liues and conuerſations.
            
            Firſt it is falſe and pepiſh doctrine, to make obedience anie cauſe of our election, when as Chriſt plainly ſheweth, their hearing & following of him, to be ſignes of their election, putting the only cauſe of it, in his fathers gift, in the 29. verſe. Then alſo a childe may ſee, this is nothing to the queſtion: for wee enquire not of the cauſes, but of the certaintie of our election. The latter part of his anſwere is in theſe words: When as therefore we doo heare the voice of Chriſt and follow him, then may we be ſure that wee are his choſen ſheepe, which can neuer bee plucked out of his hand, nor periſh, but that wee ſhall haue eternall life. But when as we refuſe to heare his voice and will not follow him, but our owne fancies and euill luſts, then may we be ſure, that we are not his choſen ſheepe.
            
            
               How this agreeth with the former part of his anſwere, I refer it to the reader, and what his craſie head here ran vpon, I will not determine. Only this ſufficeth, he granteth in theſe words, an euerlaſting certaintie of the ſtate of thoſe that are Chriſtes choſen ſhéep, therefore he granteth the argument of the place, and ſo conſequently the queſtion. Thus the Lord can make the enemies of his trueth to wound themſelues. Another of the places hee bringeth, I acknowledge, which is this: The gifts and callings ofRom. 1

His anſwere to this, is, That it was written to proue, that though the Iewes were reiected and reprobated for a time, yet at the laſt they ſhould bee conuerted vnto Chriſt, becauſe God had from the beginning choſen them, for their fathers ſakes.
            
            A lier is beſt knowne by his ſhifting: and it is their propertie, if they can poſſibly auoide it by circumſtances, they will neuer ſpeake directly to the purpoſe, as knowing they ſhal then be taken tardie. So E. G. being preſſed with the place aforeſaid, telleth vs a tale of the verſe going before it in the text, that of the Jewes ſhall alſo ſome be ſaued, becauſe they were choſen for their fathers: and ſo cunningly paſſeth ouer the proofe of that reaſon, which the Apoſtle yeldeth, and which was now the queſtion.

                   28. hauing rendred this reaſon, why of y• Jewes there ſhould be ſaued, to wit, becauſe there was of them elected for their fathers ſakes: hée ſawe this néeded further proofe: ſéeing men might think their election to be a matter of nothing, to

them that folowed not the footſteps of their godlie fathers. Therefore in the 29. verſe, he confirmeth his former reaſon, by this vniuerſall and perpetuall principle, For the gifts and calling of God are ſuch, as he cannot repent him of. As though he ſhould haue anſwered the former obiectiō in mens minds, on this ſort: The gifts of God (in the 9. Ch. 4. v.) and his calling, wherby he tooke vnto him this nation, for his people in times paſt, are not the gifts and calling of a man, who is apt to repent him of his facts, but they are of God who cannot be changed, and is ſubiect to no repentance: whereupon it followed, that their election ſtood certaine and could not be diſanulled by anie meanes. Yet E. G. who preſumed ſo much of his quicke ſight, that hee durſt ſet downe theſe points, and interprete diuers ſcriptures, contrarie to the receiued iudgement, and ſenſe of the whole Church of GOD, was ſo blinde, in eſpying the conſequence of this place, that he aſketh, how this doeth prooue, that he can neuer fall away from God, that is once truely called and ſanctified.
            
            Certeinly hée ſhall neuer iudge colours for me, that is not able to diſcerne one inch before his eies. But leſt he haue left any, as dim eids as himſelfe behinde him, I will lend them theſe ſpectacles, to make the letters greater: Whatſoeuer is done not to be repented of, for abideth euer vnremoueably, but the gifts that God giueth, and the calling wherewith he calleth his, are done, not to be repented of, therefore they abide for euer vnremoueably. And ſo conſequently

there is no breaking of anie more. The parts are plaine, and the argument (I doubt not to auouch it againſt anie heretike) inumcible. Now to theſe arguments I wil adde two or three me, not as my ſtore: (for I proteſt I could fil a 
                  〈◊〉
                treatiſe with the proofes for this purpoſe) nor yet as a thing verie needfull (conſidering what hath béen ſaid:) But for the deſire I haue, to ſatiſfie all ſuch, as are not wilfully bent to contention. E. G. hath granted before, That they are certainly Chriſtes choſen ſheepe, which heare his voice and follow him. Now we take all the truely ſanctified to be ſuch▪ therfore thoſe whom we vnderſtād here for truely ſanctified are all one with thoſe, E.G. accounteth the choſen ſheep of Chriſt. Herevpon let this be the third argument, for the perſeuerance of the ſaints. They that cannot be ſeduced, cannot fall awaie, but the elect cannot be ſeduced: (if the word of Chriſt may bee taken, 24. Math. 24. verſe) therefore the elect cannot fall away. 4. Chriſt ſaith, 4. 10. 14. verſe, Whoſoeuer ſhall drink of the water that I wil giue him, he ſhall not thirſt for euer, but that ſame water which I will giue him, ſhall become in him a fountaine of water, ſpringing vnto eternall life. Now what hee vnderſtood by that water, is explaned in the 7. of John. 39. verſe: where it is ſaid to be the ſpirite, which Chriſt wold giue thoſe that beleeued in him. Wherhence I reaſon thus: Whoſoeuer haue the holy Ghoſt promiſed to abide in them for euer, ſhall neuer fall away, but all that truely beléeue in Chriſt haue this promiſe: therfore they ſhal neuer

fall away, and ſo conſequently the ſtate of the ſaints is vnchaungeable. 5. That blaſphemous abſurditie which before hée fooliſhly charged our doctrine withall, touching the inward man of the regenerate, ſhall moſt neceſſarily bée found the conſequence of this his ſrenſie.

The golden chaine of ſo ſure a making, as the linkes can neuer be ſundred, in 8. Rom. 29. 30. verſes, warranteth vndoubtedly this doctrine vnto vs, ſith that iuſtification the loweſt linke, by the order of working is indiſſolubly coupled with glorification, the higheſt linke, for the aſſurance of poſſeſſion. To conclude, what is more firme, or can giue greater ſecuritie for the poſſeſſion of anie couenant▪ then dooth the receiuing of an earneſt pennie, vpon the ſame? Doubtles, he that receiueth it, reckoneth himſelfe as ſure of his bargaine, as if hée now enioyed it: and he that giueth it, goeth not

againe from that he hath ſaid. If the caſe bée ſo with men, (who haue no faith or credence in their word, if they be compared with the euerlaſting truth himſelfe) then how much more is the perſeuerance of the Saints, euen to the poſſeſſiō of the euerlaſting inheritance, certain and ſure vnto them, ſeeing God (that cannot be chā

            From hence E. G. aſcendeth to the high palace of predeſtination, & there taketh vpon him, like a wanton childe, more cockedly, then with any modeſtie can be declared. For, beſides the generall view of the glorious buildings, comming to the marble of Gods vnchangeable coū
               ſell, and reading the writing of his ſecret decrée, he firſt inſolently condemneth the iudgement euen of the chiefeſt of al ſuch, as God hath hitherto giuen vnto his Church, to be interpreters of his reuealed will, and next that, preſumptuouſly ſetteth foorth himſelf, to be the only true expounder of the ſame. And thus he babbleth: Firſt, God hath from the beginning purpoſed, appointed, elected and choſen in Chriſt, ſuch onely to bee in the ſtate of ſaluation, the children of God, and heires of euerlaſting life, which are in the ſtate of true repentance and amendment of life, holie and blameleſſe before God, in loue and charitie, and ſo made according to the likenes and Image of Chriſt. Secondly, God hath from the beginning, purpoſed, appointed, predeſtinate,
               
               elect, and choſen all ſuch to bee condemned to eternall death, which are not in that ſtate of true repentance and amendment of life. Whereupon (ſaith hee) it muſt needs follow, that Dauid a murtherer and an adulterer was elect and praedeſtinate of God from the beginning, to be the ſeruant of ſin, the child of the deuill, and in ſtate of eternall death. But on the contrarie, Dauid a true penitent, a righteous & holy man, blameleſſe before God in loue and charitie, hee was elect of God in Chriſt from the beginning to bee the ſonne of God, and fellowheire with Chriſt of his heauenly kingdom.
            
            To my remembrance, I neuer read ſo ſhort a ſpéech, ſo full of vnſoundnes. If a man would examine euerie word to the fartheſt, & diligently gather euerie abſurditie that falleth, the words would ſ
                  •
               arſe ſurmount the faultes in number. To all that haue their ſenſes exerciſed, they are plaine inough, only for the ſimpler ſort, I will point at the chiefeſt. Firſt, he calleth Dauid the ſonne of God, which is a fault, in that he durſt ſo boldly vſe this phraſe, contrarie to the cuſtome of the ſcriptures, which doo no where giue that title, by thoſe words vnto anie, but to the onely begotten ſonne of God, who is called [the ſonne of God] by an excellencie. Secondly, ſo déepe was his ignorance, that he knew no difference betwéene election and reprobation: wheras the former euer tendeth to life, and the latter euer to death. So that whereas he ſaith, God hath elected & choſen all ſuch to bee condemned, &c. Hee might as well haue ſaid, The Prince hath pardoned ſuch a man to be hanged▪
                Or▪
               
               The father hath made ſuch a ſonne his heire, to disinherite him. A man would thinke, fire and water could not be ioyned togither. Thirdly, pretending that this point of doctrine, hath been hitherto corruptly taught, & that he would teach the trueth, he neglected to ſet downe what predeſtination is, the diſcription whereof (notwithſtanding) he ought moſt exactly to haue ſet down: ſeeing therupon reſteth y• whole waight of the building. Fourthly, in the former part of his words, he either maketh works the cauſe of our election, or els maketh election nothing els, but an appointment or decrée of God, concerning ſuch ſignes as ſhould tell vs, who is in the ſtate of ſaluation. As though a decrée were not rather directly of ſuch thinges as ſhoulde bee brought to paſſe, the things incident thereto, hauing a more remote conſideration. Els can there be an adiunct, without his ſubiect? Now in the contrarie member, he ſaith, God hath praedeſtinate all ſuch to bee condemned to eternall death, which are not in the ſtate of true repentance. Who then is not condemned in the beginning of his life? And if euerie one of vs receiue Gods ſpeciall condemnation one time of our life, where haue we our diſpenſatiō for that ſentence afterwarde? Againe, a little wit might haue ſerued him to haue put it downe thus rather, God hath praedeſtinate all ſuch to be in the ſtate of eternall death, &c. For ſo the contrarietie of his members ſhuld haue ſtood (at leaſt) in ſome proportion. Fiftly, if when a man dooth well, he be the childe of God, & when hee ſinneth any actuall ſin (for ſo I vnderſtande

his meaning) he forthwith become the childe of the deuil, and thus again and again, as oft as he riſeth vp and falleth down, it followeth neceſſarily that the ſpirite of God diſpoſſeſſeth ye deuill, and againe the deuill diſpoſſeſſeth the ſpirite of God, from time to time. What raging blaſphemie is this? Theſe ſhall ſuffice the reader in reſpect of my labour: for it is eaſier to enter into moe, then to know when to make an end. And it is ſuffi

               ient confutation, thus to haue opened him, for a man in this high point, both vnſkilful, inconſtant, abſurd, and preſumptuous. The firſt two whereof, ſhewed him to lack teaching, the third, earneſt rebuking, but the fourth, ſeuere whipping, that he might haue learnd, how he climed any more ſo high, till the ioynts of his knowledge had béen better knit, and the ſinews of his vnderſtanding got more ſenſe. The reſt of that diuiſion, is nothing but a continued courſe of his old ſhameleſſe lying, and a begging of that which no bodie will grant him.
            In his next diuiſion, where he ſaith, Becauſe they ſurmiſe that Gods praedeſtination and election, ſhould be ſure and certaine vnto vs, although we doo euill, I aske them whereunto men are ſaid of the ho

If by [doing euill] hée ment as hée ſheweth in all other places, preſumptuous and raigning ſinnes, then he is here in his old vaine of lying, for we are ſo far from this iudgement, to call any elect, that haue ſin raigning in them, as that we are taught the flat contrarie, to wit, that the elect, after they are called, are no more

wholly ſubiect vnto ſin, to yeld willing obedience thereunto, and to ſerue ſin. Otherwiſe if he ment by [doing euill] any kinde of euill, then belike he held, that euerie kind of fall or ſlip doth cut of election. But ſome perhaps will vrge the former ſenſe againe, as to ouerthrowe my anſwere, interpreting raigning ſin, by actuall ſin, betwixt which they diſcerne no difference. If there be any ſo ignorant, they muſt learne: that euerie raigning ſin is actuall ſin, but not cōtrariwiſe, euerie actuall ſin raigning ſin. Like as al wallowings in mire are defilings to a mans bodie, but euery defiling is not wallowing in the mire. To ſlip, and fall in the dyrt to his defiling, is incident to the carefulleſt man that walketh, but to wallow in y• myre is proper vnto ſwine. So experience hath taught the deareſt children of God, that they are ſubiect to their defilements and falles, but if any man loue to fall, or lye ſtil, our ſoules haue no pleaſure in him. And now to his queſtion, I anſwere thus far, as hee would haue me: that the elect are predeſtinat to a

            O ſeducing Sophiſter. How many pitfals hath he made here to catch ye ſimple ſoules withall? Firſt he ſnatcheth this, as though it were giuen him, that euerie fall or ceaſſing from holy actions, is a cutting off, of the ſanctification, that ſo he might conclude, hée that is vnſanctified is not elect. But now he muſt reſtore it again with ſhame to his ſetters on. For euerie fall is not a falling away, as I proued before, and a ſanctified man is reputed holie, not in that he neuer falleth at any time, but in the eſtimation of the cō
               tinuall tenor and courſe of his life, for the moſt part. So was Dauid a holie man, yea, a man according to Gods owne heart. And in this ſenſe is Ezekiah ſaid, to haue cleaued vnto the2. King. 18. 6. Lord, and not to haue departed from him. Though his life was not without ſome blemiſhes of 2. King. 20. 13. raſhnes, and 2 King. 23 13. groſſe omiſſions. Otherwiſe, if there be no ſanctification but when there is a holie action, then ſanctification ſhall be nothing els but an actuall holines, now if there be no ſanctification but actuall, then which way is 1. Cor. 1. 30. phil. 3. 9. Chriſt our ſanctification? Wee muſt burie the righteouſnes that comes to vs by imputation, in the graue of forgetfulnes, with the abſurd Papiſt. If a man would proſecute the abſurdities that riſe herehence, he ſhould finde no end. For in theſe caſes, not to walke in the direct path, is

neuer to make an end of wandring. Againe, hée maketh his ſanctificatiō which is (as you heare) altogither an actuall holines, the proper adiunct and perpetuall vndeuided note of electiō, which though it haue no ground of ſcripture, yet agreeth it well with his concluſion, that there is no election at all. Thus you ſée this clauſe [at all times] muſt be raſed out in his propoſition, and ſo his mutable predeſtination prooueth but a dream. If any mā vrge y• place of Paul to y• eph. 1. 4.

               Epheſ. 4. 14▪ 15 grown to mans ſtate (like as it pleaſed the ſpirite of God to ſpeake for our capacitie) who is able by the worke of God, to diſcerne betwixt thinges that differ, and apply him ſelfe to euery right way, farre aboue manie others, who in compariſon of him, are but children in the faith of Chriſt. Thus we ſée, how manie deceiptes were ſecretly couched in this argument, to ouerthrow the certaintie of our election. But I truſt he hath left none behind him, of ſo ſimple iudgement and gifts of vnderſtanding, as that knoweth not, a decrée, to be a ſtedfaſt thing, ſuch as can not faile, Finallie to be accompliſhed, what ſoeuer falleth out betwene: eſpeciallie, the God of ſpirits, that knoweth all things that can come to paſſe, beforehand, ordaining ye ſame. Yet this miſerable man procéedeth, and ſaith: God doth from the beginning predeſtinate, and elect in Chriſt, ſome to ſtand onely for a time in the ſtate of true ſactification and ſaluation, and then giueth them ouer in iuſtice vnto themſelues, & ſo wipeth them out of the booke of life. That hipocrites euer attaine to true ſanctification, is falſe, and followeth the forme of his old beggerly reaſoning. That they are predeſtinate to life, is abſurd, and like himſelfe. That he gathereth it from ſome ſcriptures that make mention of a putting out of the booke of the liuing, as the 32. of Exod. 33. verſe, and 69. Pſal. 29. verſe, vttereth his old ignorance & childiſh vnderſtanding of the ſcriptures. Firſt therefore let the Reader conſider, that God writeth no bookes of memorie, but this is onely a ſpeach borrowed from the manners of men, and

aſcribed vnto God for our capacitie & comfort: whiles it imprinteth in the mindes of the childrē of God, that not one of them can be forgotten in the day of the iuſt, ſith they are now from euerlaſting, as plainely ſet downe in the foreknowledge of God, as if their names were regiſtred in a booke written for that purpoſe. Therfore ſaith2. Tim. 2. 19. the Apoſtle: The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, the Lord knoweth who are his. As for his places that mention a wiping out of the booke, in Exod. it is called, [The booke that thou haſt written:] in the Pſalme, [the booke of the liuing.] His iuſt anſwere might be, that there is not meant the booke of predeſtination to life, but the communicating of the couenant, which God had made with Abraham and his ſéed, whereby they were now, as in a muſtre rowle reckoned the onely people of God, the Gentiles being excluded. But if by way of conceſſion, we graunt him that place of the Pſalme to reſpect the booke of life, mentioned Apoc. 20. 12. as alſo anie ſuch place of ſcripture, reporting a racing out of the vngodlie: yet he that is not wilfullie blind, may ſée, that thoſe places, are not to be taken in a full and exquiſite ſenſe, as though any ſuch as the ſcripture thus ſpeaketh of, were euer writen in déed in the booke of life, but onely according to the ſuppoſall of men, and eſtimation that the hipocrite hath of him ſelfe: ſo doth the ſcripture in ſuch places anſwere home, to his owne heart, that he ſhall be wiped out of the number, among which he thinketh himſelf ſo certainly regiſtred and written. Which is nothing els, but to bee

declared and laid open, that howſoeuer he hath boaſtingly borne himſelfe among the Saintes, he was neuer in trueth, of their number before God. In likt ſorte Iohn ſpeaketh of thoſe that fall away: They went out from vs, that it might1. Ioh. 2. 19. be made manifeſt, they were neuer of vs. And this is (according likewiſe as I alledged before, againſt the hipocrite) to take from him, euē thatMat. 13. 12. which he was ſuppoſed to haue. This certainly is the vttermoſt, that can bee concluded out of thoſe places: although it be graunted E. G. that in them is vnderſtood the booke of predeſtination vnto life. For, that any in déed once written in the booke of life, and predeſtinate to be ſaued, can fall away, or be croſſed out of the number anie more, is vntrue, and vnpoſſible as I will proue. 1. This is a certaine place, that the elect cannot fall away: God ſpeaking by his Prophet of the new couenant, ſaith, I will put my law in theirI

G. hath hetherto ſtood in, that euer as a man ſtandeth firme, he is predeſtinate to life, and when he falleth, he is predeſtinate to death, then it followeth, that he is euer anon written in, and raced out of the booke of life, which is y• foreknowledge of God: and ſo it can not be ſaid, that predeſtination, is from before the begining of theEphe 1. 4. world, when as this man maketh it but a dayly decrée for this life. The inconuenience whereof I perceiue he ſaw not, when he ſet downe, that Dauid was predeſtinate from the beginning to be the child of the diuel when he ſinned, and againe the childe of God when he repented. Wel now at length, let vs heare his concluſion of this matter. Laſtly (
                     •
                   E. G.) we deny not, but that God hath alſo predeſtinate ſome, neuer to fall away, but to be renewed alwaies by repentance, and therein to perſeuere, euen to the day of their death. But it can not be knowne who are of this number, vntill we ſee this grace giuen vnto them of God, euen to their laſt end. O chaungeable cameleon. Had he conclucluded a lite before, that that no man is predeſtinate vnto life at all times? And what is this that he now affirmeth? Some are predeſtmate neuer to fall away, but to perſeuere vnto the end. A lier

(they ſay) had néed of a notable memorie. Touching that he ſaith, we can not know who are of this number till the end: I ſée well, he was euen ouer head and eares in poperie. But howſoeuer he, or any other euil ſpirites, call it impietie, preſumption, and ſawcines in the children of God, to hold their election in aſſurance, here in this life, let vs neuer a whit be diſcouraged, to walke ſo farre in this point alſo, as we haue iuſt warrant by the word of God. Concerning others, we haue litle to ſay, this buſineſſe concerneth euerie mans ſelfe. And if it did not greatly concerne euerie mans owne ſelfe, the Apoſtle would neuer ſo vpbradingly, haue bidden y• Corinthians, enter into this examinatiō of themſelues, ſaying, Try your own ſelues whether you be in the faith,

Peters exhortatiō, that we would2. Pet. 1. 10. make our vocation and election ſure vnto vs, that is, confirme our mindes therein by a holie life. Of the notes to examine our ſelues by, I haue ſpoken hertofore more exactly, page 75. 76. where are deſcribed the ſeueral fruites of our recōciliatiō. Briefly, like as by good works indéed, we acknowledge ſanctification, and from ſanctification aſcend to faith: (as which can bee no more ſeparated then the fire and his light) euen ſo, from thoſe ſure effects we gather our effectuall calling, from that calling we conclude our election, and ſo our predeſtination in Chriſt, as firme, (through the infallible connexion of canſes

& effects) euen as the throne it ſelf, of God is firme & vnmoueable: & here faſtening y• anker of our hope which neuer maketh vs aſhamed, wée are carried vpward, and foorthright ſtil we fare, amids ye tempeſts of all temptations (being euer conquerous through the ſpirit of God) vntill at the laſt, we attaine to the deſired glorification.

For when the ſoule now alreadie humbled and bruſed with the ſenſe and burden of ſin, ſhall receiue this newes, that there is no allowed harboure for her ſafe comfort and reioycing, til ſhée can attain to that ſtately abilitie of ſtanding, as neuer more to commit anie thing y• ſhée knoweth to be ſinne, to what extremitie ſhall ſhée bée brought hereby?

Now in that hée hath framed it thus for his purpoſe, it declareth, that I haue not charged him amiſſe hitherto, in ſaying he affirmeth the regenerate man to haue a full & abſolute power to withſtand ſin. Which as I haue (by the grace of God) plentifully confuted heretofore, ſo yet can I not, but by this flat place, preſſe him moreouer and that worthely, with theſe his owne abſurdities and contradictions.

Secondly, if this doctrine ſtand, then election is alwaies at one ſtaie with the regenerate, his perſeuerance neuer faileth vtterly, the ſpirit cannot quite be put out, and ſo that fayre

puppie [often regeneration] néedeth no other violence then ſuch, as the hand of him that begot it, bringeth here vnto it. And to conclude, thus we ſee in true conſequence, al other foundations in his booke raſed to the ground, for the eſtabliſhing of this own browne paper building, of mans abſolute abilitie: which hauing now alreadie, put the fire of Gods word vnto, it ſufficeth me here, to behold the flame thereof. Theſcriptures which he wringeth, will not yeelde him one drop of liquor to quench it. He faileth ſtill in this common fallation, to toke that for ſimply and in all reſpects, which is meant but in a meaſure and in ſome reſpects. So for the place of the Philippians, becauſe Paule ſaide he wasPhil▪ 4. 13. able by Chriſt, to behaue him ſelfe in all ſtates of life, whether in fulnes or hunger, aboundance or ſcarcitie, this man wil vnderſtand it, of euery actiō throughout Paules life, & of an abſolute power to performe the ſame, euen as he would. In like ſorte dealeth he, with the other two places, 1. Cor. 4. 4. and 2. Tim. 4. 18. In both which, Paule ſpeaketh, concerning the offices and dueties of his Apoſtleſhip. I know nothing by my ſelfe.

And, I haue not yet attained the marke, nor am not perfect. Beſide what ſoeuer may be ſaide for Paules holie life, yet hee reaſoneth abſurdlie frō him to vs: as if he ſhould

haue ſaid: A man can carrie a hundreth waight, therefore a childe can do the ſame. The 1. Ioh. 5. 4. hurteth his cauſe: for the beginning of the verſe is, whoſoeuer is borne of God, ouercommeth the world, which we acknowledge, namely the worke to be a doing, euen from the firſt day of our effectuall calling. The other part of the verſe is, and this is the victorie which hath ouercome the world, to wit, our faith, wherin if his eies had ſerued him, he might haue ſéene, that our preſent victory is placed, not in actuall, but in imputatiue righteouſneſſe onely, that is, in ſuch righteouſneſſe as wee haue in Chriſt by faith: which ſurely ſhould not be, if we had here an abſolute power. And whereas he ſaith, there is nothing ſo hard or ſtrong, which (by Chriſt) we ſhall not be able to performe & ouercome: he ſaith trueth: but the queſtion is not betwéene vs, what we ſhalbe able, or how much we ſhall attaine vnto finally: But whether our ſtrength be at full to do good, and our power abſolute in this life therevnto.

to beat downe our pride and to humble vs, that when the naturall ticklinges of our proud conceiptes would ariſe, from the knowledg of our fauour with God, the preſent ſight of our remaining corruption, might ſtrike downe our tailes againe as the Peacocke doth, at the beholding of his foule feete. Secondlie, for that it is the pleaſure of God, thus by our weakenes, to bring2. Cor. 12. 9. his power to perfect manifeſtation, whileſt the foyles of ſinne ſhame vs, euen as the deſpitefull buffetings of an aduerſarie, and force vs euer anon, to runne for reſcue: whereby we continuallie teſtifie, that the power of the Lord onely ſaueth vs. Of this our cōdition, the conducting of y• children, of Iſrael into the land of Canaan, is a liuely picture. We doubt not, ye Lord could haue brought his people to the promiſed land, without battaile: But becauſe the land of Canaan, was a figure of our heauenly countrey, it was his pleaſure, that they in dayly conflicts, ſhould bee found conquerours, yet by his might: for ſo it was told them, The Lorde ſhall fightExod. 14. 14. Ioſ. 6. for you. A goodlie teſtimonie thereof they had, at the winning of Iericho, whoſe walles fell downe at the ſound of the trumpets compaſſing them. Which hath a comfortable proportion, with the victories that Gods children haue in their ſpirituall battailes: the prayers and groninges of the faithfull, being no vaine or idle noyſe, flying about in the aire, but like thoſe pearſing trumpetes, at the ſound of which, the ſtrong walles of Iericho were ouerthrown. moreouer, after God had brought the Iſraelits

he putteth it in y• place of Chriſt himſelf, whereby (therefore) it is become an Idoll vnto him. 6. So far he procéedeth in ſeducing, that he ſaith,Vnder the title (Againſt pariſh Preachers, &c. & in his booke of the life and maners of true Chriſtians. the wife ought to go away from her huſband, (if he wil not go with her) in y• caſe of want of this diſcipline: and (which maketh his fault y• worſe) he pretendeth ground for this, in the 1.

But of this mans abſurdities hitherto, his time commeth ſhortly to be better knowne.

Col. 1. 9. 10. in al iudgement, according as the Apoſtle exhorteth vs? Or is it not rather to go backward, and to looſe euen that you had attained vnto? Now to the laſt point, concerning your peace. I mean not here the outward peace, but I offer again toRom. 5. 1. 2. 3. your view, the peace of your conſcience, euē the inward reſt and repoſe of your ſoules with God, in reſpect of this ſtrange courſe you haue lately vndertaken. Whereof becauſe you are beſt priuie in your ſelues, I refer it alſo moſt vnto your ſelues. Only of thoſe things, that in this reſpect, haue bin apparant to all mens eies, I wil briefremember you. This is eaſily granted of al that know God: what courſe of life ſoeuer hath the

approbation of Gods chearful countenance ſhining into the conſcience of the practiſer thereof, it is ſuch, as being founded on the ſure word of God, is the more conſtantly held on, and continued vnto the ende. For the ſpirit within, & the word without, ioyning to the teſtifying & teaching of anie trueth vnto vs, bring vs to ſuch peace and comfort with the Lord, in the practiſe of it, as maketh vs more and more aſſured therof, and ſo the firmelier to perſeuere therein, euen vnto the end. Contrariwiſe, that courſe or demeanour of life, that hath any other foundation then this, as it ſhall neuer be confirmed by that inward approbation, ſo is it excéedingly ſubiect to continuall changes & reuoltings. If we ſhall therefore coniecture of your inward peace, by the ſtedfaſtnes of your outward deporting, and carying your ſelues, in this your ſeparat courſe, I ſuppoſe, we cannot deeme, that y• peace of God hath poſſeſſed your minds this while.
