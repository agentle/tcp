                  ine Baſanier of Paris, I was eaſilie enduced to turne it into Engliſh, vnderſtanding that the ſame was no leſſe gratefull to you here, then I know it to be acceptable to manie great & worthie perſons there. And no maruell though it were verie welcome vnto you, & that you liked of the tranſlation thereof, ſince no historie hetherto ſet foorth hath more affinitie, reſemblance or conformitie with yours of Virginea, then this of Florida. But calling to minde that you had ſpent more yeares in France then I, and vnderſtande the french better then my ſelfe, I foorth with perceiued that you approued mine endeuour, not for any priuate eaſe or commoditie that thereby might redounde vnto you, but that it argued a ſinguler and especiall care you had of thoſe, which are to be employed in your owne like enterpriſe, whom, by the reading of this my tranſlation, you woulde haue forewarned and admoniſhed aſwell to beware of the groſſe negligence in prouiding ſufficiencie of victuals, the ſecuritie, diſorders, and mutinies that fell out among the french, with the great inconueniences that thereupon enſued, that by others miſhapsOther men

Manie ſpeciall pointes concerning the commodities of theſe parts, the accidentes of the French-mens gouernment therein, the cauſes of their good or bad ſucceſſe, with the occaſions of their abandoning one of their fortes, and the ſurpriſe of the other by the

And that the rather, becauſe the ſame with diuers other things of chiefest importance are liuely drawen in coulours at your no ſmale charges by the skilfull painter Iames Morgues, yet liuing in the Blacke-fryers in London (whomThe chiefe things worthie obſeruation in Florida are drawne in colours by la

And here to ſpeake ſomewhat of this your enterpriſe, I affirme, that if the ſame may ſpeedily and effectually be purſued, it will prooue farre more beneficiall in diuers reſpects vnto this our relme, then the worlde, yea manie of the wiſer ſort, haue hitherto imagined: The particuler commodities whereof are well knowen vntoA collection of the commodities of Virginea. your ſelfe and ſome fewe others, and are faithfully and with great iudgement committed to writing, as you are not ignorant, by one of your followers, which remayned there a full tweluemonth with your worſhipfully lieutenant M.

The Portugals alſo at their first footing in Madera, as Iohn Barros writes in his firſt Decade, found nothing there but mightie woodes for timber, whereupon they called the Ilande by that name. Howbeit the climate being fauourable, they inriched it by their own industrie with the best wines and ſugers of the world. The like maner of proceeding they vſed in the Iſles of the Aſſores by ſowing therin great quantitie of Woad. So delt they in S. Thomas vnder the Equinoctial, & in Braſil & ſondry other places. And if our men will follow their ſteps, by your wiſe direction I doubt not but in due time they ſhall reape no leſse commoditie and benefit. Moreouer there is none other likelihoode but that her Maieſtie, which hath Chriſtned and giuen the name to your Virginea, if neede require, will deale after the maner of honorable godmothers, which, ſeeing their goſſops not fully able to bring vp their children themſelues, are wont to contribute to their honest education, the rather if they finde any towardlines or reaſonable hope of goodnes in them.

of our moſt magnificent & gratious prince ELIZABETH of Englande, into whoſe lappe the Lord hath most plentifully throwne his treaſuries, what may we, I ſay, hope of her forwardnes & bountie in aduancing of this your moſt honourable enterpriſe being farre more certaine then that of Columbus, at that time eſpecially, and tending no leſſe to the glorie of God then that action of the Spaniards. For as you may read in the verie laſt wordes of the relation of Newe Mexico extant now in engliſh, the maine lande, where your last colonie meane to ſeate themſelues, is repleniſhed with many thouſands of Indians, Which are of better wittes then thoſe of MexicoThe aptnes of the people in the mayne of Virginea to embrace Chriſtianitie. and Peru, as hath beene found by thoſe that haue had ſome triall of them: whereby it may be gathered that they will eaſilie embrace the Goſpell, forſaking their idolatrie, wherein at this preſent for the moſt part they are wrapped & intangled. A wiſe Philoſopher noting the ſundry deſires of diuers men, writeth, that if an oxe be put into a medow he will ſeeke to fill his bellie with graſſe, if a ſtorke be caſt in ſhe will ſeeke for ſnakes, if yee turne in a hound he will ſeeke to ſtart an hare: So ſondrie men entring into theſe diſcoueries propoſe vnto themſelues ſeuerall ends. Some ſeeke authoritie and places of commandement, others experience by ſeeing of the worlde, the moſt part worldly and tranſitorie gaine, & that often times by diſhonest and vnlawfull meanes, the fewest number the glorie of God and the ſauing of the ſoules of the poore & blinded infidels.

               THere are two thinges, which according to mine opinio
                  ••
                haue been the principall cauſes in conſideration whereof aſwell they of auncient times, as thoſe of our age haue been enduced to trauell into farre and remote regions. The firſt hath beene the naturall deſire which we haue to ſerch out the commodities to liue happely, plentifully, and at eaſe: be it whether one abandon his naturall cuntrie altogether, to dwell in a better, or bee it that men make voiages thither, there to ſerch out and bring from thence ſuch thinges as are there to bee found, and are in greateſt eſtimation and in moſt requeſt in our cuntries. The ſecond cauſe hath beene the multitude of people too frutefull in generation, which, being no longer able to dwell in their natiue ſoyles, haue entred vppon their neighbours limites, and oftentimes paſſing further haue pearced euen vnto the vttermoſt regions. After this ſorte the north climate, a frutefull father of ſo many nations, hath oftentimes ſent foorth this way and that way his valiant people, and by this meane hath peopled infinite countries: ſo that moſt of the nations of Europe drawe their original from theſe partes. Contrariwiſe the more ſouthern regions, becauſe they be too barraine by reaſon of their inſupportable heate which raigneth in them, neede not any ſuch ſending foorth of their in habitances, and haue beene oftentimes conſtrained to receaue other people more often by force ofarmes then willingly. All Africke, Spaine, and Italie, can alſo teſtifie the ſame, which neuer ſo abounded with people that they had neede to ſend them abroode to inhabite elſe where: as on the contrary Scythia, Norway, Gotland, and France haue done. The poſterite of which nations remaineth yet not only in Italie, Spaine and Affricke, but alſo in frutefull and faire Aſia. Neuertheleſſe I find that the Romains proceding farther, or rather adding vnto theſe two chiefe cauſes aforeſayd, (as being moſt curious to plant not only their enſignes and victories, but alſo their lawes, cuſtomes, and religion in thoſe provinces which they had conquered by forcePlanting of colonies. ofarmes) haue oftentimes by the decree of their ſoueraine Senate ſent forth inhabitantes, which they called colonies, (thinking by this way to make their name immotall), euen to the vnfurniſhing of their owne countrye of the forces which ſhould haue perſerued the ſame in her perfection: a thing which hindred them much more, then advanced them to the poſſeſſion of the vniverſall monarchie, where vnto their intention did aſpyre. For it came to paſſe that their colonies here and there being miſerably ſacked by ſtrang people

did vtterly ruine and ouerthrowe their empire. The brinkes of the riuer of Rine are yet red, thoſe of Danubius are noe leſſe bloodie, and our France be came fatte with their blood which they loſt. Theſe are the effectes and rewardes of al ſuch as being pricked forward with this Romaine and tirannicall ambition will goe aboute thus to ſubdue ſtrange people: effectes, I ſay, contrarie to the profitte which thoſe ſhall receaue, which only are affectioned to the common benefitte, that is to ſay, to the generall pollicie of all men, and endeuour to vnite them one with another as well by traſicke and forraine conuerſations, as alſo by militarie vertues, and force of armes, whenas the ſauages wil not yeeld vnto their endeuours ſo much tending vnto their profite.
            For this cauſe princes haue ſent foorth out of their dominions certaine men of good actiuitie, to plante themſelues in ſtrang countries, there to make their profite to bring the countrie to ciuilitie, and, if it might be, to reduce the inhabitantes to the true knowledg of our God: an end ſo much more commédable, as it is farre from all tiranicall and cruell gouernement: and ſo they haue alwayes thriued in their enterpriſes, and by lyttle and little gained the hartes of them which they haue conquered or wonne vnto them by any meanes. Here of we may gather that ſometimes it is good, yea very expedient to ſend foorth men to discouer the pleaſure and commoditie of ſtrang countries: But ſo, that the country out of which theſe companies are to paſſe remayneTwo conditiō required in cō

As within theſe fewe dayes paſt the french haue proued to my great greife, being able by no meanes poſſible to withſtand the ſame, conſidering that the elementes, men, and al the fauours which might be hoped for of a faithful and Chriſtian alliance fought againſt vs: which thing I purpoſe to diſcouer in this preſēt hiſtorie with ſo euident truth, that the kings maieſtie my ſouerainge prince ſhall in parte be ſatiſfied of the diligence which I haue vſed in his ſeruice, and myne aduerſaries ſhall find themſelues ſo diſcouered in their falſe reportes, that they ſhall haue no place of refuge. But before I beginne, I wil brefely ſet downe the ſituation and deſcription of the land where vnto we haue failed and where we haue inhabited from the yeare 1561 vnto ſixtie fiue, to the ende that thoſe thinges may the more eaſily be borne a way, which I meane to deſcribe in this diſcourſe.

               THat part of the earth which at this day wee call the fourth part of the world or America, or theAmerica vnknowen to all antiquitie. Weſt India, was unknowen vnto our aunceſtors by reaſon of the great diſtance thereof. In like manner all the Weſterne Ilandes and fortunate Iſles were not diſcouered but by thoſe of our age. Howbeit there haue beene ſome which haue ſaid that they were diſcouered in the time of Auguſtus Caeſar, and that Virgil hath made mention thereof in the ſixt booke of his Aeneidos, when he ſaith, That there is a lande beyond the ſtarres, and the courſe of the yeere and of the ſunne, where Atlas the Porter of heauen ſuſtaineth the pole vpon his ſhoulders: neuertheleſſe it is eaſie to iudge that he meaneth not to ſpeake of this land, whereof no man is founde to haue written before his time, neither yet aboue a thouſand yeeres after. Chriſtopher Colon did firſt light vpon thisChriſtopher Colon or Columbe. lande in the yeere 1492. And fiue yeeres after Americus went thither by the commaundement of the king of Caſtile, and gaue vnto it his owne name, wherevpon afterward it was called America.
               Americus Veſpucius of whom America tooke the name. This man was very well ſeene in the Arte of Nauigation and in Aſtronomie: whereby be diſcouered in his time many landes vnknowen vnto the auncient Geographers. This countrey is named by ſome, the land of Breſill, and the lande of Parots. It ſtretcheth it ſelfe according vnto Poſtel from the one pole to the other, ſauing at the ſtraight of Magelan, wherevnto it reacheth, three andThe firſt generall part of America. fiftie degrees beyonde the equator. I will deuide it for the better vnderſtanding into three principall partes. That which is toward the pole Articke or the North, is called newe Fraunce, becauſe that in the yeere 1524, Iohn Verarſana a Florentine was ſent by king Frauncis the firſt, and by Madam the Regent his mother vnto theſe newe regions, where he went on land, and diſcouered all the Coſte which is from the tropicke of Cancer, to witte, from the eight and twentith vnto the fiftith degree, and farther to the North. Hee planted in this Countrey the enſignes and armes of the king of

Fraunce: ſo that the Spaniardes themſelues, which were there afterward, haue named this Countrey Terra Franceſca. The ſame then extendeth it ſelfe in Latitude from the 25. degree vnto the 54, toward the North: and in Longitude from 210. vnto 330. The Eaſterne part thereof is called by the late Writers the lande of Norumbega, which beginneth at the Bay of Gama, which ſeparateth it from the Iſle of Canada, whither Roberuall and Iaques Carter ſayled the yeere 1535. About the which there are many Ilands, among which is that which is named Terra de Labrador ſtretching toward Groneland. In the Weſterne parte there are many knowne countries, as the Region of Quiuira, Ceuola, Aſtatlan, and Terlichichimici. The Southerne part is called Florida, becauſe it was diſcouered on Palmeſunday, which the Spaniards call Paſcha Florida. The Northerne part is altogether vnknowen.
            The ſecond part of all America is called Newe Spaigne. ItThe 2. general part of America. extendeth from the tropick of Cancer in the 23. degrees and a half, vnto the nienth degree. In the ſame is ſcituated the citie of Themiſtitan, and it hath many regions, and many Ilandes adioyned vnto it, which are called the Antilles, whereof the moſt famous and renounced are Hiſpaniola and Iſabella, with an infinite number of others. All this land together with the Bay of Mexico, and all the Iſlandes aforeſaide haue not in longitude paſt ſeuentie degrees, to wit, from the 240. vnto three hundreth and ten: it is alſo long and narrow as Italie. The third part of America is called Peru, it isThe 3. general part of America. very great, and extendeth it ſelfe in latitude from the tenth degree vnto the 53. beyond the equator, to wit, as I haue ſaide before vnto the ſtraite of Magelan. It is made in faſhion like to an egge, and is very well knowne vppon all ſides. The parte where it is largeſt hath threeſcore degrees, and from thence it waxeth narrower and narrower toward both the endes. In one part of this land Villegagnon planted right vnder the tropicke of Capricorne, and he called it Fraunce Antarticke, becauſe it draweth toward the pole Antarticke, as our Fraunce doth toward the Articke.
            New Fraunce is almoſt as great as all our Europe. HowbeitFlorida with an ample deſcription therof. the moſt knowne and inhabited parte thereof is Florida, whether many Frenchman haue made diuerſe voyages at ſundry times, in ſo much that now it is the beſt known countrie, which is in al this

parte of new Fraunce. The Cape thereof is as it were a long head of land ſtreatching out into the Sea an hundred leagues, and runneth directly toward the South, it hath right ouer againſt it 25. leagues diſtant the Iſle of Cuba otherwiſe called Iſabella, toward the Eaſt the Iſles of Bahama & Lucaya, and toward the Weſt the Bay of Mexico. The Countrie is flat, and deuided with diuers riuers, and therefore moyſt, and is ſandie towards the Sea ſhore. There groweth in thoſe parts great quantitie of Pynetrees whichThe trees of Florida, haue no kernels in the Aples which they beare. Their Woods are full of Oakes, Walnuttrees, blacke Cherietrees, Mulbury trees, Lentiſkes, and Cheſtnut trees, which are not naturall as thoſe in Fraunce. There is great ſtore of Ceders, Cypreſſes, Bayes, Palme trees, Hollies, and wilde Uines, which clime vp along the trees and beare good Grapes. There is there a kind of Medlers, the fruit whereof is better then that of Fraunce, and bigger. There are alſo Plum trees, which beare very fayre fruite, but ſuch as is not very good. There are Raſpiſſes, and a little bearie which we call among vs Blues, which are very good to eate. There growe in that Countrie a kind of Roots which they call in their language Hatſeh whereof in neceſſitie they make bread.

And in truth the Indians which take great pleaſure in painting of their ſkins know very well how to vſe the ſame. The men are of an Oliue colour, of great ſtature, fayre without any deformitie, and well proportioned. They couer their priuities with the ſkin of a ſtagge wel dreſſed. The moſt part of them haue their bodies, armes, & thighes painted with very fayre deuiſes: the paynting whereof can neuer be taken away, becauſe the ſame is pricked into their fleſh.

They make the ſtring of their bow of a gutte of a ſtagge or of a ſtagges ſkinne, which they know how to dreſſe as well as any man in Fraunce and with as many different ſorts of coloures. They head their arrowes with the teeth of Fiſhes and ſtone which they work very fine and handſomly.

The kinges of the Countrie make great warre one againſt the other, which is not executed but by ſurpriſe, and they kill all the men that they can take: afterward they cut of their heads to haue their haire, which returning home they carry away, to make thereof their triumph when they come to their houſes.

When they goe to warre their king marcheth firſt, with a clubbe in the one hand, and his bow in the other, with his quiuer full of arrowes. All his men follow him, which haue likewiſe their bowes and arrowes. While they fight they make great cries and exclamations. They take no enterpriſe in hand but firſt they aſſemble oftentimes their council together, and they take very good aduiſement in any matter before they groweTheir aſſemblies. to a reſolution.

During the ſpace of ſixe moones (ſo they reckon their moneths) there are certain women appointed which bewayle the death of this king, crying with a loude voyce thriſe a day, to wit, in the morning, at noone, and at Euening.

Hauing therefore ſayled two monethes, neuer holding the vſuall courſe of the Spaniardes, he arriued in Florida, landing neere a Cape or Promontorie, which is no high lande, becauſe the coſte is all flatte, but onelie riſing by reaſon of the high woods, which at his arriuall he called Cape François in honour of our Fraunce. This Cape is diſtant from the equatorCape Frāçois in 30. degrees. about 30. degrees. Coaſting from this place towardes the North, he diſcouered a very fayre and great riuer, which gaue him occaſion to caſt anker that he might ſearch the ſame the next day very early in the morning: which being done, by the breake of day, accompanied with Captaine Fiquinuille and diuers other ſouldiers of his ſhippe, he was no ſooner arriued on the brinke of the ſhore, but ſtraight he perceiued many Indians men and women, which came of purpoſe to that place to receiue the Frenchmen with all gentleues & amity, as they wel declared by the Oration which their king made, and the preſents of Chamoys ſkins wherwith he honored ourA piller ſer vp. captaine, which the day following cauſed a piller of hard ſtone to be planted within the ſaide riuer, and not farre from the mouth of the ſame vppon a little ſandie knappe, in which Piller the armes of Fraunce were carued and engraued. This being done he imbarked himſelf again to the end alwaies to diſcouer the coſt toward the North which was his chief deſire. After he had ſayled a certain time he croſſed ouer to the other ſide of the riuer, and then in the preſence of certaine Indians which of purpoſe did attende him, hee commaunded his men to make their praiers, to giue thankes toPraier and thankes to God. GOD, for that of his grace he had conducted the French nation into theſe ſtraunge places, without anye perill or daunger at all.

The prayers being ended, the Indians which were very attentiue to harken vnto them, thinking, in my iudgement, that we worſhipped the ſunne, becauſe wee alwayes had our eyes lifted vp towarde heauen, roſe all vp and came to ſalute the Captaine Iohn Ribault, promiſing to ſhewe him their king, which roſe not vp as they did, but remayned ſtill ſitting vppon greene leaues of bayes and Palmetrees: toward whom the Captaine went and ſate downe by him, and heard him make a long diſcourſe, but with no great pleaſure, becauſe he coulde not vnderſtand his language, and much leſſePreſents giuen to Ribault. his meaning. The king gaue our Captain at his departure a plume or fan of Egrepthes feathers died in red, and a baſket made of palm boughes after the Indian faſhion, and wrote verye artificially, with a great ſkinne paynted and drawne throughout with the Pictures of diuers wilde beaſtes ſo liuely drawen and portraide that nothing lacked but life. The Captain to ſhew himſelf not vnthankful gaue him pretie tinne braſelets, a cutting hook, a looking glaſſe, & certaine kniues: wherevpō the king ſhewed himſelfe to bee very glad, and fully contented. Hauing ſpent the moſt part of the day with theſe Indians, the captaine imbarked himſelfe to paſſe ouer to the other ſide of the riuer, whereat the king ſeemed to be very ſorie.

Our Captaine knowing not what to iudge of this mans behauiour thought he was ielous becauſe we went firſt vnto the other king, or els, that he was not wel pleaſed wt the piller or colume which he had planted. While thus he knew not what hereof to think, our captaine ſhewed him by ſignes, that hee was come from a far countrey of purpoſe to ſeeke him, to let him vnderſtand the amity which he was deſirous to haue with him: for the better confirmation whereof, he drew out of a butchet certaine trifles, as certaine braſelets couered as it were with ſiluer and guilt, which he preſented him withall, and gaue his ſons certaine other trifles. Wherevpon the king began very louingly to intreate both our Captaine and vs. And after theſe gentle intertainments, we went our ſelues into the woods, hoping there to diſcouer ſome ſingularities: where were great ſtore of mulbeary trees white and redde, on the coppes whereof there was an infinite numberGreat ſtore of ſilkewormes. of ſilke wormes. Following our way we diſcouered a fayre and great medowe, deuided notwithſtanding with diuers mariſhes, which conſtrained vs, by reaſon of the water which enuironed it about to returne backe againe toward the riuers ſide. Finding not the king there, which by this time was gone home to his houſe, we entred into our boates and ſayled toward our ſhippes: where after we arriued, we called this Riuer the riuer of May, becauſe weThe riuer of May. diſcouered it the firſt daye of the ſaide moneth. Soone after wee were returned to our ſhippes, we weighed our ankers and hoyſed our ſayles to diſcouer the coſte farther forward, along the which we diſcouered another fayre Riuer, which the Captaine himſelfe was minded to ſearch out, and hauing ſearched it out with the king and inhabitants thereof, he named it Seine, becauſe it is very like vntoThe riuer of Seine. the Riuer of Seine in Fraunce. From this riuer we retired toward our ſhips, where being arriued, we trimmed our ſailes to ſaile further toward the North, and to deſcry the ſingularities of the coſte. But we had not ſayled anye great way before wee diſcouered another very fayre Riuer, which cauſed vs to caſt anker ouer againſt it, and to trimme out two Boates to goe to ſearche it out.

We found there an Ile and a king no leſſe affable then the reſt,The Riuer of Somme. The Riuer of Loyre. The Riuers of Cherente, Garonne, Gironde, Belle, Grande. afterward wee named this Riuer Somme. From thence wee ſayled about ſixe leagues, after wee diſcouered another Riuer, which after we had vewed was baptiſed by vs by y• name of Loyre. And conſequently we there diſcouered fiue others: whereof the firſt was named Cherente, the ſecond Garonne, the third Gironde, the fourth Belle, the fifte Grande: which being very well diſcouered with ſuch things as were in them, by this time in leſſe then y• ſpace of threeſcoare leagues we had foūd out many ſingularites a longe nine riuers. Neuertheleſſe not fully ſatiſfied we ſailed yet farther toward the North, following the courſe that might bring vs to the Riuer of Iordan, one of the fayreſt Riuers of the North, and holding our wonted courſe, great fogs and tempeſtes came vpon vs which conſtrayned vs to leaue the coſt to beare toward the mayne Sea, which was the cauſe that we loſt the ſight of our Piniſſes a whole day and a night, vntill the next day in the morning, what tune the weather waxing fayre and the Sea calme wee diſcoueredThe riuer Belle a veoir. a Riuer which we called Belle a veoir. After we had ſayled three or foure leagues, we began to eſpie our Piniſſes which came ſtraight towardes vs, and at their ariuall they reported to the Captayne, that, while the foule weather and fogges endured, they harbored themſelues in a mightie Riuer which in bigneſſe and beautie exceeded the former: wherewithall the Captayne was exceeding ioyfull, for his chiefe deſire was to finde out an Hauen to harboure his Shippes, and there to refreſh our ſelues for a while. Thus making thitherwarde wee ariued a thwarte the ſaid RiuerThe Riuer of Port Royall in 32 degrees of latitude. (which becauſe of the fayreneſſe and largenes thereof we named Port Royal) wee ſtrooke out ſayles and caſt Anker at ten fathom of water: for the depth is ſuch, namely when the Sea beginneth to flowe, that the greateſt Shippes of Fraunce, yea, the Argueſſes of Venice may enter in there. Hauing caſt Anker the Captayne with his Souldiers went on ſhore, and hee himſelfe went firſt on land: where we found the place as pleaſant as was poſſible, for it was all couered ouer with mightie high Okes and infinite ſtore of Cedars, and with Lentiſques growing vnderneath them, ſmelling ſo ſweetly that the very fragrant odour only made the place to ſeeme exceedingTurkey cockes Partridges gray & redde. pleaſant.

Theſe two armes are two great leagues broad: and in the middeſt of them there is an Ile, which is poynted towardes the opening of the great riuer, in which Ilande there are infinite numbers of all ſorts of ſtrange beaſts, There are Simples growingStore of rare ſimples. there of ſo rare proprieties, and in ſo great quantitie, that it is an excellent thing to behold them. On euery ſide there is nothing to be ſeene but Palmetrees and other ſortes of trees bearing bloſſoms and frute of very rare ſhape and very good ſmel. But ſeeing the euening approch, and that the Captayne determined to returne vnto the ſhippes, we prayed him to ſuffer vs to paſſe the night in this place. In our abſence the Pilots and chiefe mariners aduertiſed the Captayne that it was needfull to bring the Shippes farther vpwithin the Riuer, to auoyde the daungers of the windes which might anoy vs by reaſon of our being ſo neere to the mouth of the Riuer: and for this cauſe the Captayne ſent for vs. Being come to our Shippes wee ſayled three great leagues farther vp within the Riuer, and there wee caſt Anker. A little while after, Iohn Ribault accompanied with a good number ofRibault ſayleth 12. leagues vp the riuer. ſouldiers imbarked himſelfe deſirous to ſayle further vp into the arme that runneth toward the weſt, and to ſearch the commodities of the place. Hauing ſayled twelue leagues at the leaſt wee perceaued a troupe of Indians, which as ſoone as euer they eſpied the

Pinniſles, were ſo afrayd that they fledde into the woods, leauing behind them a young Lucerne which they were a turning vpon a ſpitte: for which cauſe the place was called Lucerne Cape: proceedingLucerne cape. foorthon our way, we found an other arme of the riuer, which ranne toward the Eaſt, vp which, the Captain determined to ſayle & to leaue the great currant. A little while after they began to eſpie diuerſe other Indians both men & womē half hiddē within y• woods: whoknowing not y• wee were ſuch as deſired their friendſhip, were diſmayed at the firſt, but ſoone after were embouldned, for the Captayne cauſed ſtore of marchandiſe to be ſhewed thē openly, wherby they knew y• we ment nothing but wel vnto thē: & then they made a ſigne y• we ſhould come on land, which we would not refuſe. At our comming on ſhore diuerſe of thē came to ſalute our Generall according to their barbarouſe faſhion. Some of them gaue him ſkins ofChamoyes.

Afterwards they wentPerles. about to make an arbour to defend vs in y• place from the parching heate of the ſunne. But we would not ſtay as then. Wherefore the Captayn thanked them much for their good wil, & gaue preſents to eche of them: where with he pleaſed them ſo well before hee went thence, that his ſuddaine departure was nothing pleaſaunt vnto them. For knowing him to be ſo liberall they would haue wiſhed him to haue ſtayed a little longer, ſeking by all meanes, to giue him occaſion to ſtay, ſhewing him by ſignes that he ſhould ſtay but that day onely, and that they deſired to aduertiſe a great Indian Lord which had perles in great aboundance, and ſiluer alſo, allStore of perles and ſiluer. which things ſhould be giuen vnto him at y• kings ariual: ſaying far ther y• in the meane while y• this great Lord came thether they wold lead him to their houſes, & ſhew him there a thouſand pleaſures in ſhooting & ſeeing the Stag killed, therfore they prayed him not to deny thē their requeſt.

This done we imbarked our ſelues and ſayled three leagues towards the weſt: where we diſcouered a litle riuer, vp which we ſayled ſo long, that in the ende we found it returned into the great currant, and

Afterward we imbarked our ſelues to ſearch another Ile not farre diſtant from the former: wherein after we had gon a land we found nothing but tall Ceders, the fayreſt that were ſeene i

A fewe dayes afterward Iohn Ribault determined to returne once againe toward the Indians which inhabited that arme of the Riuer which runneth toward the Weſt, and to carry with him good ſtore of ſouldiers. For his meaning was to take two Indians of this place to bring them into Fraunce, as the Queene had commaunded him. With this deliberation againe we tooke our former courſe, ſo farre foorth that at the laſt we came to the ſelfeſame place where at the firſt weTwo Indians taken away. found the Indians, from thence we tooke two Indians by the permiſſion of the king, which thinking that they were more fauoured then the reſt thought themſelues very happie to ſtay with vs. But theſe two Indians ſeeing we made no ſhew at all that we would goe on land, but rather that we followed the middeſt of the courrant, began to be ſomewhat offended, and would by force haue lepte into the water, for they are ſo good ſwimmers that immediately they woulde haue gotten into the forreſtes. Neuertheleſſe being acquainted with their humour, wee watched them narrowly and ſought by all meanes to appeaſe them: which wee could not by any meanes doe for that time, though wee offered them thinges which they much eſteemed, which thinges they diſdayned to take, and gaue backe againe whatſoeuer was giuen them, thinking that ſuch giftes ſhould haue altogether bound them, and that in reſtoring them they ſhoulde bee reſtored vnto their

libertie. In fine, perceiuing that all that they did auayled themThe dolefull ſongs of the Indians. nothing, they 
                  •••
               yed vs to giue them thoſe thinges which they had reſtored, which wee did incontinent: then they approched one toward the other, and beganne to ſinge, agreeing ſo ſweetly together, that in hearing their ſonge it ſeemed that they lamented for the abſence of their friendes. They continued their ſonges all night without ceaſſing: al which time we were conſtrained to lie at anker by reaſon of the tide which was againſt vs, but wee hoyſed ſayle the next day very early in the morning, and returned to our ſhips. Aſſoone as we were come to our ſhippes euery one ſought to gratifie theſe two Indians, & to ſhew thē the beſt countenaunce that was poſſible: to the intent that by ſuch curteſies they might perceiue the good deſire and affectiō which we had to remain their friends in time to come. Then we offered them meate to eate, but they refuſed it, and made vs vnderſtande that they were accuſtomed to waſh their face, and to ſtaye vntill the ſunne were ſet beforeThe Indians eat not before the ſun be ſet. they did eate, which is a ceremonie common to al the Indians of new Fraunce. Neuertheleſſe in the ende they were conſtrayned to forget their ſuperſtitions, and to apply thēſelues to our nature, which was ſomewhat ſtrange vnto them at the firſt. They became therefore more ioconde, and euery houre made vs a thouſande diſcourſes, being marueilous ſorie that we could not vnderſtand thē. A few dayes after they began to beare good wil toward me, ſo heartie good will I ſay, that, as I thinke, they would rather haue periſhed with hunger and thirſt then haue taken their refection at any mans hand but mine. Seing this their great good will, I ſought to learn ſome Indian wordes, and began to aſke them queſtions, ſhewing them the thing whereof I deſired to know the name, how they called it. They were very glad to tell it me, and knowing the deſire that I had to learne their language, they incouraged me afterward to aſke them euerye thing. So that putting downe in writing theLaudonniers putting downe in writing the wordes and phraſes of the Indiās ſpeech. wordes and phraſes of the Indian ſpeech, I was able to vnderſtand the greateſt part of their diſcourſes. Euery day they did nothing but ſpeake vnto me of the deſire that they had to vſe me well, if we returned vnto their houſes, and cauſe me to receiue all the pleaſures that they coulde deuiſe, aſwell in hunting as in ſeeing their verye ſtrange and ſuperſtitious ceremonies at a certaine feaſt which theyThe feaſt of Toya. call Toya. Which feaſt they obſerue as ſtraightly as wee obſerue

the ſunday. They gaue me to vnderſtand, that they would bring me to ſee the greateſt Lord of this countrey which they called Chiquola,
               Chiquola or Chiquora a king of greate ſtature. which exceedeth them in height (as they tolde me) a good foote and a halfe. They ſaid vnto me that he dwelt within the land in a very large place and incloſed exceeding high, but I coulde not not learne wherewith. And as farre as I can iudge, this place,The firſt proof that Chiquola ſhould be a very faire citie. whereof they ſpake vnto me, was a very faire citie. For they ſayde vnto me that within the incloſure there was greate ſtore of houſes which were built very high, wherein there was an infinite number of men like vnto themſelues, which made none account of golde, ofGold, ſiluer, & pearles in aboundance. The rich citie of king Chiquola is toward the North of

And ſtraightway one of them ſtretching forth his hand ſhewed me that they dwelt toward the North, which maketh mee thinke that it was in the riuer of Iordan. And now I remember, that in the reigne of the Emperour Charles the fift, certaine Spaniardes inhabitants of Saint Domingo, (which made a voyage to get certaine ſlaues to worke in their mynes) ſtole away by ſuttletie the inhabitants of this riuer, to the number of fortie thinking to carry them into their new Spaine. But they loſt their labour: for in deſpite they died all for hunger, ſauing one that was brought to the Emperour, which a little while after he cauſed to be baptiſed, and gaue him his owne name & called him Charles of Chiquola, becauſe he ſpake ſo much of this Lorde of Chiquola, whoſe ſubiect he was. Alſo, (as men woorthy credite haue aſſuredThe ſecond proofe. The third proofe. me) he reported continually, that Chiquola made his abode within a very great incloſed citie. Beſides this proofe, thoſe which were left there in the firſt voyage haue certified me, that the Indians ſhewed them by euident ſignes, that farther within the land on y• foreſaide part toward the North, there was a great encloſure or Citie, and within the ſame manye faire houſes, wherein Chiquola dwelt. But not to digreſſe from my matter, I wil returne to the Indian, which took ſo great delight in ſpeaking to me of this Chiquola, that there neuer paſſed anie one day, wherein hee did not diſcourſe of ſome rare thing concerning the ſame. After they had ſtayed a while in our ſhippes, they beganne to be ſorie, and ſtill demaunded of me when they ſhoulde returne. I made them vnderſtande that the Captaines will was to ſende them home againe, but that

firſt he would beſtow apparrel of them, which few dayes after was deliuered vnto them. But ſeeing he would not giue them licence to depart, they reſolued with themſelues to ſteale away by night, and to get a little boate which we had, and by the helpe of the tide, to ſayle homeward towarde their dwellinges, and by this meanesThe 2. Indians eſcape away. to ſaue thēſelues. Which thing they failed not to doe, and put their enterpriſe in execution, yet leauing behind them the apparel which the Captaine had giuen them, and carrying away nothing but that which was their owne, ſhewing wel hereby that they were not void of reaſon. The Captaine cared not greatly for their departure, conſidering they had not beene vſed otherwiſe then well: and that therefore they woulde not eſtrange themſelues from the Frenchmen. Captaine Ribault therefore knowing the ſingular faireneſſe of this riuer deſired by all meanes to encourage ſome of his men to dwell there, well foreſeeing that this thing might bee ofThe benefit of planting. greate importaunce for the Kinges ſeruice, and the reliefe of the common wealth of Fraunce. Therefore proceeding on with his intent, he commaunded the ankers to be weighed and to ſet things in order to returne vnto the opening of the riuer, to the end that if the winde came faire he might paſſe out to accompliſh the reſt of his meaning. When therefore we were come to the mouth of the riuer, he made them caſt anker, whervpon we ſtayed without diſcouering any thing all the reſt of the day. The next day he commaunded that all the men of his ſhip ſhould come vp vppon the decke, ſaying that he had ſomewhat to ſay vnto them. They all came came vp, and immediately the Caytaine beganne to ſpeake vnto them in this manner. I thinke there is none of you that is ignoraunt of howeThe oration of Ioh. Ribault to his companie. greate conſequence this our enterpriſe is, and alſo howe acceptable it is to our young king. Therefore, my friends, as one deſiring your honour and benefite, I woulde not fayle to aduertiſe you all of the exceeding greate good happe which ſhoulde fall to them, which, as men of valure and worthy courage, would make triall in this our firſt diſcouerie of the benefites and commodities of this newe lande: which ſhould be, as I aſſure my ſelfe, the greateſt occaſion that euer could happen vnto them, to ariſe vnto the title and degree of honour. And for this cauſe I was deſirous to propoſe vnto you and ſet downe before your eies the eternall memorie which of right they deſerue, which forgetting both

their parentes and their countrey haue had the courage to enterpriſe a thing of ſuch importance, which euen kinges themſelues vnderſtanding to be men aſpiring to ſo high degree of magnanimitie and increaſe of their maieſties, doe not diſdaine ſo wel to regarde, that afterwardes employing them in matters of weight and of high enterpriſe, they make their names immortal for euer. How beit, I woulde not haue you perſwade your ſelues, as manie do, that you ſhall neuer haue ſuch good fortune, as not being knowen, neither to the king nor the Princes of the Realme, and beſides deſcending of ſo poore a ſtock, that few or none of your parents, hauing euer made profeſsion of armes, haue beene knowen vnto the great eſtates. For albeit that from my tender yeeres I my ſelf haue applied al my induſtry to follow them, & haue hazarded my life in ſo many dangers for the ſeruice of my Prince, yet could I neuer attaine thervnto, (not that I did not deſerue this title and degree of gouernment,) as I haue ſeen it happen to many others, only bicauſe they deſcended of a noble race, ſince more regarde is had of their birth than of their vertue. For well I knowe that if vertue were regarded, there would more be found better to deſerue the title, and by good right to be named noble and valiant. I will therfore make ſufficient anſweare to ſuch propoſitions and ſuche thinges as you maye obiect againſt mee, laying before you the infinite examples which we haue of the Romaines: which concerning the point of honour were the firſt that triūphed ouer the world. For how many find we among them, which for their ſo valiant enterpriſes, not for the greatneſſe of their parentage, haue obtayned the honour to triumph. If we haue recourſe vnto their aunceſters, wee ſhall finde that their parentes were of ſo meane condition, that by labouring with their handes they liued verie baſely. As the father of AeliusAelius Pertinax deſcending from baſe parētage became Emperor of Rome Pertinax, which was a poore artiſant, his Grandfather likewiſe was a bond man, as the hiſtoriographers do witueſſe: and neuertheleſſe, being moued with a valiant courage, he was nothing diſmayed for al this, but rather deſirous to aſpire vnto high things, he began with a braue ſtomacke to learne feates of armes and profited ſo well therein, that from ſteppe to ſtep he became at length to be Emperour of the Romaines For all this dignitie he deſpiſed not his parentes: but contrariwiſe, and in remembrance of them, hee cauſed his fathers ſhoppe to bee couered with a fine wrought

                  marble, to ſerue for an example to men deſcended of baſe & poore linages, and to giue them occaſion to aſpire vnto high things, not withſtanding the meannes of their aunceſters. I will not paſſe ouer in ſilence the excellencie and prowes of the valiant and renoumed Agathocles the ſonne of a ſimple potter, and yet forgeting the cō

               eſtate of his father, he ſo applied himſelfe to vertue in his tender yeeres, that by the fauour of armes he came to be king of Sicilie: and for all this title he refuſed not to be counted the ſonne of a Potter. But the more to eterniſe the memorie of his parents and to make his name renowmed, he commaunded that he ſhould be ſerued at the Table in Veſſels of gold and ſiluer and others of earth: declaring thereby, that the dignitie wherein he was placed came not vnto him by his parents, but by his owne vertue onely. If I ſhal ſpeak of our time, I will lay before you onely Ruſten Baſſha, which may be a ſufficient example to all men: which
               Ruſten Baſſha of an heardmans ſonne through his valure became the great Turkes ſonne in lawe. 
               though he were the ſonne of a poore heardman, did ſo apply his youth in all vertue, that being brought vp in the ſeruice of the great Turke he ſeemed ſo to aſpire to great & high matters, in ſuch ſorte that growing in yeeres he increaſed alſo in courage, ſo farre foorth, that in fine for his excellent vertues he married the daughter of the great Turke his Prince. How much then ought ſo many worthy examples to moue you to plant here? Conſidering alſo that hereby you ſhalbe regiſtred for euer as the firſt that inhabited this ſtrange countrey. I pray you therefore all to aduiſe your ſelues therof▪ and to declare your minds freely vnto me, proteſting that I will ſo well imprint your names in the kings eares, and the other princes, that your renowme ſhall hereafter ſhyne vnquenchable through our Realme of Fraunce. He had ſcarcely ended his Oration, but the greateſt part of our ſouldiers replyed, that a greater pleaſure could neuer betide them, perceiuing well the acceptableThe

the nextday to ſearch the moſt fit and conuenient place to be inhabited. Wherefore he embarked himſelfe very early in the morning and commaunded them to follow him that were deſirous to inhabite there, to the intent that they might like the better of the place. Hauing ſayled vp the great riuer on the north ſide, in coſting an Ile which endeth with a ſharpe point toward the mouth of the riuer, and hauing ſayled a while, he diſcouered a ſmall riuer, which entred into the Ilande, which hee would not fayle to ſearch out. Which done, and finding the ſame deepe inough to harbour therein Gallies and Galliots in good number, proceeding further, hee found a very open place, ioyning vpon the brinke thereof, where he went on land, and ſeeing the place fit to builde a fortreſſe in, and commodious for them that were willing to plant there, he reſolued incontinent to cauſe the bignes of the fortification to be meaſured out. And conſidering that there ſtayed but ſixeThe length & bredth of the Forte, taken by Laudonnier & Captayne Salles. and twentie there, hee cauſed the Forte to bee made in length but ſixteene fathome, and thirteene in breadth, with flankes according to the proportion thereof. The meaſure being taken by me and Captaine Salles, we ſent vnto the Shippes for men, and to bring Shouels, Pickaxes and other inſtruments neceſſary to make the fortification. We traueiled ſo diligently thatA Fort builte in port Roy all by Ribault. in a ſhorte ſpace the Fort was made in ſome ſorte defenſible. In which meane time Iohn Ribault cauſed victualles and warrelike munition to be brought for the defence of the place. After he had furniſhed them with all ſuch thinges as they had neede of, he determined to take his leaue of them. But before his departureRabaults ſpeech to Captayne Albert. he vſed this ſpeach vnto Captayne Albert, which hee lefte in this place: Captayne Albert, I haue to requeſt you in the preſence of all men, that you would quite your ſelfe ſo wiſely in your charge, and gouerne ſo modeſtly your ſmall company which I leaue you, which with ſo good cheere remayneth vnder your obedience, that I neuer haue occaſion but to commend you, and to recount vnto the king, as I am deſirous, the faithfull ſeruiceHis ſpeeche to the ſouldiers. which before vs all you vndertake to doe him in his new Frauuce: And you companions, quoth hee to the the Souldiers, I beſeech you alſo to eſteeme of Captayne Albert as if it were my ſelfe that ſtayed here with you, yeelding him that obedience which a ſouldier oweth vnto his Generall and Captayne, liuing as brethren

one with another, without all diſſention: and in ſo doing God will aſſiſt you and bleſſe your enterpriſes. Hauing cnded his exhortation wee tooke our leaues of eche of them, and ſayled towarde our Sippcs, calling the Forte by the name of CharlesThe foreſaid Fort was called Charles Fort. Forte, and the Riuer by the name of Chenonceau. The next day wee determined to depart from this place being as well contented as was poſſible that wee had ſo happily ended our buſineſſe, with good hope, if occaſion would permitte, to diſcouer perfectely the Riuer of Iordan. For this cauſe we hoyſed our ſayles about ten of the clocke in the morning: after wee were ready to depart Captaine Ribault commaunded to ſhoote of our Ordinance to giue a farewell vnto our Frenchmen, which fayled not to doe the like on their parte. This being done wee ſayled towarde the North: and then wee named this Riuer PortePort Royal. Royall, becauſe of the largeneſſe & excellent fayreneſſe of the ſame. After that wee had ſayled about fifteene leagues from thence wee eſpied a Riuer, wherevppon we ſent our Piuneſſe thether to diſcouer it. At their returne they brought vs word that they found not paſt halfe a fathome water in the mouth thereof.The Riuer Baſe. 15. legue

                Which when wee vnderſtood, without dooing any thinge elſe, wee continued our way, and called it the Baſe or Shallowe Riuer. As wee ſtill went on ſounding, we founde not paſt fiue or ſixe fathome water, although wee were ſixe good leagues from the Shore: at length wee found not paſt three fathoms, which gaue vs occaſion greatly to muſe. And without making any farther way we ſtroke our ſayles, partely becauſe wee wanted water, and partly becauſe the night approched: during which time Captayne Iohn Ribault bethought with himſelfe, whether it were beſt for him to paſſe any farther, becauſe of the eminent daungers which euery houre wee ſawe before our eyes: or whether hee ſhould content himſelfe with that which hee had certaynely diſcouered, and alſo left men to inhabite the Countrey. Being not able for that time to reſolue with himſelfe, he referred it ouer vntill the next day. The morning being come he propoſed to all the company what was beſt to bee done, to the end that with good aduiſement euery man might deliuer his opinion. Some made aunſweare, that according to their iudgement hee had occaſion fully to content himſelfe, conſidering that hee

cold doe no more: laying before his eyes, that he had diſcouered more in ſixe weekes, then the Spaniardes had done in two yeeres in the conqueſtes of their new Spaine: and that he ſhould doe the king very great ſeruice, if he did bring him newes in ſo ſhort a time of his happie diſcouerie. Other ſhewed vnto him the loſſe & ſpoyle of his victualles, and on the other ſide the inconuenience that might happen by the ſhallow water that they found continually along the coſt. which things being well and at large debated, we reſolued to leaue the coſt, forſaking the North, to take our way toward the Eaſte, which is the right way and courſe for our Fraunce, whereTheir ariual in Fraunce 1561. the 20. of Iuly. we happily arived the twenteth day of Iuly the yeere a thouſand fiue hundred ſixtie and one.

               OUr men after our departure neuer reſted, but night and day did fortifie themſelues, being in good hope that after their fort was finiſhed, they would beginne to diſcouer farther vp within the Riuer. It happened one day, as certayne of them were in cutting of rootes in the Coppiſes, that they eſpyed on the ſodayne an Indian that hu

Captayne Albert was very ioyfull of his comming, which after he had giuen him a ſhert and ſome other trifles, hee aſked him of his dwelliug: the Indian anſwered him that it was farther vp withinKing Auduſta. the Riuer, and that he was vaſſel of king Auduſta: he alſo ſhewed him with his hand the limites of his habitation. After much other talke the Indian deſired leaue to departe, becauſe it drewe toward night, which Captayne Albert graunted him very willingly. Certayne dayes after the Captayne determined to ſayle toward Auduſta, where being ariued, by reaſon of the honeſt intertaynmentNote. which he had giuen to the Indian, he was ſo courteouſly receiued, that the king talked with him of nothing elſe, but of the deſire which he had to become his friend: giuing him beſides to vnderſtand that he being his friend and allie, he ſhould haue the amitie of foure other kings, which in might and authoritie were able to

doe much for his ſake: Beſides all this, in his neceſſitie they might be able to ſuccour him with victualles: One of theſe kings was called Mayon, another Hoya, the third Touppa, and the fourthMayon. Hoya. Touppa. Stalame. 
                  Stalame. He tolde him moreouer, that they woulde bee very glad, when they ſhoulde vnderſtand the newes of his comming, and therefore he prayed him to vouchſafe to viſit them. The Captayne willingly conſented vnto him for the deſire that he had to purchaſe friendes in that place. Therefore they departed the next day very early in the morning, and firſt ariued at the houſe of king Touppa, and afterward went vnto the other kings houſes, except the houſe of king Stalame. He receiued of eche of them all the amiable curteſies that might be: they ſhewed themſelues to be as affectioned friendes vnto him as was poſſible, and offered vnto him a thouſand ſmall preſents. After that he had remained by the ſpace of certayne dayes with theſe ſtrange kinges, he determined to take his leaue, and being come back to the houſe of Auduſta, he cōmaunded al his men to goe abord of their Pinneſſe: for he was minded to goe toward the countries of king Stalame, which dweltThe Countrey of king Stalame 15. leagues Northward of Charles Fort. towarde the North the diſtance of fifteene great leagues from Charles Fort. Therefore as they ſayled vp the riuer they entred into a great Courrant, which they followed ſo far till they came at the laſt to the houſe of Stalame: which brought him into his lodging, where he ſought to make them the beſt cheere he colde deuiſe. He preſented immediately vnto Captayne Albert his bow & arrowes, which is a ſigne and confirmation of aliance betweeneChamoys ſkins. them. He preſented him alſo with Chamoys ſkins. The Captaine ſeing the beſt parte of the day was nowe paſt tooke his leaue of king Stalame to returne to Charles Fort, where hee ariued the day following. By this time the friendſhip was growne ſo great between our men & king Auduſta, that in a maner all things were commen betweene him & them: in ſuch ſorte that this good Indian king did nothing of importance, but he called our men thereunto. For when the time drew neere of the celebrating their feaſtes of Toya, which are ceremonies moſt ſtrange to recite, hee ſentThe feaſt of Toya largely deſcribed. Ambaſſadours vnto our menne to requeſt them on his behalfe to be there preſent. Whereunto they agreed moſt willingly for the deſire that they had to vnderſtand what this might be. They

embarked themſelues therefore and ſayled towarde the kinges houſe, which was already come foorth on the way towards them to receaue them curteouſly, to bid them welcome and bring them to his houſe, where he ſought to entreate them the beſt hee might. In the meane while the Indians prepared themſelues to celebrate the feaſt the morrow after, & the king brought them to ſee the place, wherin the feaſt ſhould be kept: where they ſaw many womē round about which laboured by all meanes to make the place cleane and neate. This place was a great circuit of ground with open proſpecte and rounde in figure. On the morrowe therefore early in the morning, all they which were choſen to celebrate the feaſt, being paynted and trimmed with riche fethers of diuers colours,The Indians trimming of themſelues with rich fethers put themſelues on the way to goe from the kings houſe toward the place of Toya: whereunto when they were come they ſette themſelues in order, and followed three Indians, which in painting and in geſture were differing from the reſt: ech of them bare a Tabret in their hand, daunſing and ſinging in a lameutable tune when they began to enter into the middeſt of the rounde circuit, being followed of others which anſwered them agayne. After that they had ſong, daunſed, and turned three times, they fell on running like vnbridled horſes, through the middeſt of the thickeſt woods. And then the Indian women continued all the reſt of the day in teares as ſad and wofull as was poſſible: and in ſuch a rage they cut the armes of the yonge gerles, which they lanced crutlly with ſharpe ſhelles of muſkels, that the blood followed, which they flang into the ayre, crying out three times, He Toya. The king Auduſta had gathered all our men into his houſe, while the feaſt was celebrated, and was exceedingly offended when he ſaw them laugh. This he did becauſe the Indians are very angry when they are ſeene in their ceremonies. Notwithſtanding one of our men made ſuch ſhifte that by ſubtile meanes hee gatte out of the houſe of Auduſta, and ſecretly went and hid himſelfe behinde a very thicke buſh, where at his pleaſure, he might eaſily diſcry the ceremonies of the feaſt. They three that began the feaſt are named Iawas: and they are as it were three Prieſtes of the Indian lawe: to whome they giue credite and beliefe, partely becauſeIawas are their Prieſts. that by kinred they are ordayned to bee ouer their Sacrifices,

Agayne they are not onely reuereuced for theſe thinges, but alſo becauſePhiſitions. they heale diſeaſes by I wotte not what kinde of knoweledge and ſkill they haue. Thoſe that ran ſo through the woods returned two dayes after: after their returne they began to daunce with a cheerefull courage in the middeſt of the fayre place, and to cheere vp their good olde Indian fathers, which either by reaſon of their too great age, or by reaſon of their naturall indiſpoſition and feebleneſſe were not called vnto the feaſt. When all theſe daunces were ended, they fell on eating with ſuch a greedineſſe, that they ſeemed rather to deuour their meate then to eate it, for they had neither eaten nor drunke the day of the feaſt nor the two dayes following. Our men were not forgotten at this good cheere, for the Indians ſent for them all thither, ſhewing themſelues verye glad of their preſence. While they remayned certayne time with the Indians a man of ours got a yonge boy for certaine trifles, and enquired of him what the IndiansInuocations of the Iawas or Priſtes vnto Toya. did in the wood during their abſence: which boy made him vnderſtand by ſignes that the Iawas had made inuocations to Toya, and that by Magicall Characters they had made him come that they might ſpeake with him and demaund diuers ſtrange thinges of him, which for feare of the Iawas hee durſt not vtter. They haue alſo many other ceremonies, which I will not here rehearſe for feare of moleſting the reader with a matter of ſo ſmall importance. When the feaſt therefore was finiſhed our men returned vnto Charles Forte: where hauing remayned but aTheir victuals fayle them. while their victualles began to waxe ſhorte, which forced them to haue recourſe vnto their neighbours, and to pray them to ſuccour thē in that their neceſſitie: which gaue them part of al the victuals which they had and kepte no more vnto them ſelues then wouldeThe Indians maner of liuing in the Winter time of Maſt and rootes.

They tolde them farther that for this cauſe it was needefull for them to retire themſelues into the woodes, to liue of Maſt and rootes vntill the time of Harueſt, being as ſory as might bee that they were not able any farther to ayd them. They gaue them alſo counſel to goe toward the countries of king Couexis a man of might & renowne in this preuince,

which maketh his aboad toward the South abounding at all ſeaſons and repleniſhed with ſuch quantitic of mill, corne, and beanes that by his onely ſuccour they might be able to liue a very longKing Ouade. time. But before they ſhould come into his territories, they were to repayre vnto a king called Ouade the brother of Couexis, which in Mill, Beanes, and corne was no leſſe welthy, and withall is very liberall, and which would bee very ioyfull if hee might but once ſee them. Our men perceauing the good relation which the Indians made them of thoſe two kings reſolued to goe thither; for they felt already the neceſſitie which oppreſſed them. Therefore they made requeſt vnto king Maccou, that it would pleaſe him to giue them one of his ſubiectes to guide them the right way thither:King Maccou. whereunto he condiſcended very willingly, knowing that without his fauour they ſhould haue much adoe to bring their enterpriſe to paſſe. Wherefore after they had giuen order for all thinges neceſſary for the voyage, they put themſelues to Sea, and ſayled ſo farre that in the end they came into the countrey of Ouade, which they founde to bee in the Riuer Belle. BeingOuades countrey in the riuer Belle. there ariued they perceaued a company of Indians which aſſone as they knew of their being there came before them. Aſſone as they were come neere them, their guides ſhewed them by ſignes that Ouade was in this company, wherefore our men ſet forwarde to ſalute him. And then two of his ſonnes which were with him, being goodly and ſtrong men ſaluted them agayne in very good ſorte, and vſed very friendly intertainment on their parte. The kinge immediately beganue to make an Oration in his Indian language of the great pleaſure and contentment which hee had to ſee them in that place, proteſting that he would become ſo loyall a friend of theirs hereafter, that hee would bee their faithfull defendour againſt all them that woulde offer to bee their enimies. After theſe ſpeeches hee ledde them towarde his houſe, where hee ſought to intreate them very courteouſly. His houſe was hanged about with Tapiſtrie of feathers of diuerſeTapiſtrie of feathers.

Moreouer the place where the kinge tooke his reſt was couered with white Couerlettes embroydered with deuiſes of verye wittie and fine workemanſhippe, and fringed round about with a Fringe dyed in the coulour of Skarlate. They aduertiſed the kinge by one of the

guides which they brought with them, howe that (hauing heard of his greate liberalitie) they had put to the Sea to come to beſeech him to ſuccour them with victuals in their great want and neceſſitie: and that in ſo doing, he ſhould binde them all hereafter to remaine his faithfull friendes and loyall defenders againſt all his enemies. This good Indian aſſoone readye to doe them pleaſure, as they were to demaund it, commaunded his ſubiectes that they ſhould fill our Pinneſſe with mil and beanes. AfterwardThe liberalitie of king Ouade he cauſed them to bring him ſixe pieces of his tapiſtry made like little couerlets, and gaue them to our men with ſo liberall a minde, as they eaſily perceyued the deſire which he had to become their friend. In recompence of all theſe giftes our men gaue him two cutting hookes and certaine other triſſes, wherewith he helde himſelf greatly ſatiſfied. This being done, our men took their leaue of the king, which for their farewell, ſayd nothing elſe but that they ſhould returne if they wanted victuals, and that they might aſſure themſelues of him, that they ſhould neuer want any thing that was in his power. Wherefore they embarked themſelues, and ſailed towards. Charlesfort, which from this place might be ſome fiue andOuades countrie 25. leagues Southward frō Charlesfort. twenty leagues diſtant. But as our men thought thēſelues at their eaſe, and free from the dangers whereinto they had expoſed themſelues night and day in gathering together of victuals here & there: Loe, euen as they were aſleepe, the fire caught in their lodgings with ſuch furie, being increaſed by the wind, that the great roomeThe fort ſet on fire by caſualtie. that was built for them before our mens departure, was conſumed in an inſtant, without being able to ſaue any thing ſauing a very little of their munition. Whervpon our men being farre from all ſuccours, found themſelues in ſuch extremitie, that without the ayde of almighty God, the onely ſearcher of the heartes and thoughtes of men, which neuer forſaketh thoſe that ſeeke him in their afflictions, they had byn quite and clean out of all hope. For the next day betimes in the morning the king Auduſta and king Maccou came thither, accōpanied wt a very good cōpanie of Indians, which knowing the miſfortune, were very▪ ſory for it. And then they vttered vnto their ſubiects the ſpeedy diligence which they were to vſe in building another houſe, ſhewing vnto them that the Frenchmen were their louing friendes, and that they had made it euident vnto them by the giftes and preſents which they had receiued: proteſting that

Within a ſmall while after this miſchance, their victuals began to waxe ſhort: and after our men had taken good deliberation, thought and bethought them ſelues againe, they founde that there was no better way for them then to returne agayne vnto King Ouadé and Couexis his brother. Wherefore they reſolued to ſend thither ſome of their companie the next day following: which with an Indian Canoa ſayled vp into the countrey about tenne leagues: afterwarde they founde a very fayre and great riuer of freſh water, which they fayled not to ſearch out: they found therin a great number of Crocodils, which in greatneſſe paſſe thoſe of theCrocodiles. riuer Nilus: moreouer, all along the bankes thereof, there growe mighty high Cypreſſes. After they had ſtayed a ſmall while in thisCypreſſes. place, they purpoſed to followe their iourney, helping themſelues ſo well with the tides, that without putting themſelues in danger of the continuall perill of the Sea, they came into the Countrey of Ouadé, of whom they were moſt curteouſly receyued.Their ſecond iourney to the countrey of Ouadé. They aduertiſed him of the occaſion, wherefore they came againe to viſite him, and tolde him of the miſchance, which happened vnto them ſince their laſt voyage: howe they had not onelie loſt their houſholde ſtuffe by caſualtie of fire, but alſo their victuals which hee had giuen them ſo bountifully: that for this cauſe they were ſo bolde as to come once againe vnto him, to beſeech him to vouchſafe to ſuccour them in ſuch neede and neceſſitie. After that the king had vnderſtood their caſe, he ſent meſſengers vnto his brother Couexis, to requeſt him vppon his behalfe to ſende him ſome of his mill and beanes: which thing he did: and the next day early in the morning, they were come againe with victualles, which the king cauſed to be borne into their Canoa. Our men would haue taken their leaue of him finding themſelues more than ſatiſfied with this liberalitie. But for that day he

woulde not ſuffer them, but retayned them, and ſought to make them the beſt cheere he coulde deuiſe. The next day very early in the morning, hee tooke them with him to ſhewe them the place where his corne grewe, and ſaide vnto them that they ſhoulde not want as long as all that mill did laſt. Afterwarde he gaue them a certaine number of exceeding faire pearles, and two ſtones of fineExceeding faire pearles fine Chriſtall, ſiluer oare.

Hee made them aunſweare, that it came tenne great dayes iourney from his habitation vp within the countrey: and that the Inhabitauntes of the Countrey did digge the ſame at the foote of certaine high mountaines, where they founde of it in very good quantitie. Being ioyfull to vnderſtande ſo good newes, and to haue come to the knowledge of that which they moſt deſired, they tooke their leaue of the king, and returned by the ſame way, by which they came. Beholde therefore howe our men behaued themſelues very well hitherto, although they had endured many great miſhaps. But miſfortune or rather the iuſt iudgement of God would haue it, that thoſe which coulde not be ouercome by fire nor water, ſhoulde be vndone by their owne ſelues. This is the common faſhion of mē, which cannot continue in one eſtate, and had rather to ouerthrowe themſelues, than not to attempt ſome new thing daily. We haue infinite examples in the auncient hiſtories, eſpecially of the Romanes vnto which number, this litle handful of men, being far from their countrey, and abſent frō their countriemen, haue alſo added this preſent example. They entred therfore into partialities and diſſentions which began about a ſouldier named Guernache, which was a drū

And the principall occaſion that moued them therevnto, was becauſe hee degraded another ſouldier

named La chere, (which he had baniſhed) and becauſe he had not performed his promiſe: for he had promiſed to ſend him victuals from eight dayes to eight daies, which thing he did not, but ſaide on the contrarie, that he would be glad to heare of his death.

Hauing executed their purpoſe, they went to ſeeke the Souldier that was baniſhed, which was in a ſmall Iland diſtant from Charlesfort about three leagues, where they found him almoſt halfe dead for hunger. When they were come home againe, they aſſembled themſelues together to chooſe one to be gouernour ouer them, whoſe name was NicolasNicolas Barré choſen Captaine. Barré, a man worthy of commendation, and one which knew ſo well to quite himſelfe of his charge, that all rancour and diſſention ceaſſed among them, and they liued peaceably one with another, During this time, they beganne to builde a ſmall Pinneſſe, with hope to returne into Fraunce, if no ſuccours came vnto them as they expected from day to day. And though there were not a man among them that had any ſkill, notwithſtanding neceſſitie, which is the maiſtreſſe of all ſciences, taught them the wayes to builde it. AfterA new Brigā

But they wanted thoſe thinges that of all other were moſt needfull, as cordage and ſailes, without which the enterpriſe could not come to effect. Hauing no meanes to recouer theſe thinges, they were in worſe caſe then at the firſt, and almoſt ready to fall into deſpayre. But that good God, which neuer forſaketh the afflicted, did ſuccour them in this neceſſity. As they were in theſe perplerities, king Auduſta and Maccou came to them, accompanied with two hundred Indians at the leaſt, whom our Frenchmen went foorth to meete withal, and ſhewed the king in what neeede of cordage they ſtood, who promiſed them to returne within two dayes, and to bring ſo much as ſhould ſuffice to furniſh the Pinneſſe with tackling. Our men being pleaſed with theſe good newes and promiſes beſtowed vpon them certaine cutting hookes and ſhirtes. After their departure our men ſought all meanes to recouer roſen in the woodes, wherein they cut the Pine trees round about, out of which they

They went forward therefore to finiſhe the Brigandine, and vſed ſo ſpeedie diligence, that within a ſhorte time afterwarde they made it readie furniſhed with all thinges. In the meane ſeaſon the winde came ſo fit for their purpoſe that it ſeemed to inuite them to put to ehe Sea: which they did without delay after they had ſet all their thinges in order. But before they departed they embarked their artillarie, their forge, and other munitions of warre which Captaine Ribault had left them, and then as much mill as they coulde gather together. But being drunken with the too exceſſiue ioy, which they had conceiued for their returning into Fraunce, or rather depriued of all foreſight and conſideration, without regarding the inconſtancie of the winds, whichThey put to the ſea without ſufficient victuals. change in a moment, they put themſelues to ſea, and with ſo ſlender victualles, that the end of their enterpriſe became vnlucky and vnfortunate. For after they had ſayled the third parte of their way, they were ſurpriſed with calmes which did ſo much hinder them, that in three weeks they ſayled not aboue fiue and twentie leagues. During this time their victuals cōſumed, and became ſo ſhort, that euery man was conſtrained to eate not paſt twelue graines of mill by the day, which may be in value as much as twelue peaſon. YeaTheir victuals vtterly conſumed. and this felicitie laſted not long: for their victuals failed them altogether at once: and they had nothing for their more aſſured refuge but their ſhoes and leather ierkins which they did eate. Touching their beuerage, ſome of them dranke the Sea water, others didThey drinke their vrine for want of freſh water. drinke their owne vrine: and they remayned in ſuch deſperate neceſſitie a very long ſpace, during the which, parte of them died for hunger: beſides this extreeme famine, which did ſo grieuouſly oppreſſe them, they fell euery minute of an houre out of all hope euer

to ſee Fraunce againe, in ſo much that they were conſtrayned to caſt the water continually out that on all ſides entred into their Barke. And euery day they fared worſe and worſe: for after they had eaten vp their ſho

                  es and their letherne Ierkins, there aroſe ſo boyſterous a winde and ſo contrary to their courſe, that in the turning of a hande the waues filled their veſſell halfe full of water and bruſed it vpon the one ſide. Being nowe more out of hope then euer to eſcape out of ſo extreame perill they cared not for caſting out of the water which nowe was almoſt readie to drowne them. And as men reſolued to die, euery one fell downe backeward, and gaue themſelues ouer altogether vnto the will of the waues. When as one of them a little hauing taken hart vnto him declared vnto them how little way they had to ſayle, aſſuring them that, if the winde held, they ſhould ſee land within three dayes. This man did ſo incourage them, that after they had throwne the water out of the Pinneſſe they remayned three dayes without eating or drinking, except it were of the Sea water. When the time of his promiſe was expired they were more troubled then they were before, ſeeing they could not diſcry any lande. Wherefore in this extreme deſpaire certayne among them made this motion, that it was better that one man onely ſhould dye, then that ſo many men ſhould periſh: they agreed therefore that one ſhould dye to ſuſtaine the others. Which thinge was executed in the perſon of La Chere,

After the peace was made in Fraunce, my Lord Admiral de Chaſtillon, ſhewed vnto the king, that he heard no newes at all of y• men which Captaine Iohn Ribault had left in Florida, & that it were pity to ſuffer them to periſh. In which reſpect the king was content he ſhould cauſe three ſhips to be furniſhed, y• one of ſixe ſcore tuns, the other of a 100. and the third of 60. to ſeeke them out, and to ſuccour them. My Lorde Admirall therefore, being well informed of the faithful ſeruice which I had done, aſwel vnto his maieſty as to his predeceſſors kings of Fraūce, aduertiſed the king how able I was to do him ſeruice in this voyage, which was the cauſe that he made me chief captain ouer theſe 3▪ ſhips, & charged me to depart wt diligence to perform his cōmandement, which for mine own part I would not gainſay, but rather thinking my ſelf happy to haue beene choſē out amōg ſuch an infinit number of others, which in my iudgmentLaudonniers ſecond voyage to Florida with 3. ſhips the 22. of April 1564. were very wel able to haue quited thēſelues in this charge, I embarked my ſelf at new hauē

Sayling therefore on forwarde, wee landed the next day in the Iſle of Teneriffe, otherwiſe called the Pike, becauſe that in the middeſt thereof there is an exceeding high moū
               taine,

neere as high as that of Etna, which riſeth vp right like a pike, into the top wherof no man can go vp but from the middeſt of May vntill the middeſt of Auguſt, by reaſon of the ouer great colde which is there all the reſt of the yeere: which is a woonderfull ſtrange thing, conſidering that it is not paſt ſeuen and twentie degrees and a halfe diſtaunt from the Equator. We ſawe it all couered ouer with ſnowe, although it were then but the fifte of May. The inhabitantes in this Iſle being heretofore purſued by the Spaniardes, retired themſelues into this mountaine, where for a ſpace they made warre with them, and woulde not ſubmit themſelues vnto their obedience, neither by foule nor faire meanes, they diſdayned ſo much y• loſſe of their Iland. For thoſe which went thither on the Spaniards behalfe, left their carkaſes there, ſo that not ſo much as one of them returned home to bring newes. Notwithſtā

After I had furniſhed my ſelfe with ſome freſhe water, very good and excellent, which ſprang out of a rocke at the fo

As ſoone as wee had caſt Anker, two Indians inhabitantes of that place ſayled toward vs in two Canoaes full of a fruit of great excellencie which they call Ananas. As they approched vnto ourAnanas a fruite of great excellencie. barke, there was one of them which being in ſome miſdoubt of vs, went backe againe on land, and fled his way with as much ſpeede as he could poſſibly. Which our men perceiued, and entred with diligence into the other Canoa, wherein they caught the poore Indian & brought him vnto me. But the poore fellow became ſo aſtonied in beholding vs, that he knew not which way to behaue himſelfe, becauſe that (as afterward I vnderſtood) hee feared that he was

fallen into the Spaniard hands, of whom he had beene taken once before, and which, as he ſhewed vs, had cut of his ſtones. At length this poore Indian was aſſured of vs, and diſcourſed vnto vs of many things, wherof we receaued very ſmal pleaſure, becauſe we vnderderſtood not his mind but by his ſignes. Thē he deſired me to giue him leaue to depart, & promiſed me y• he would bring me a thouſād preſents, whereunto I agreed on condition that hee would haue patience vntill the next day when I purpoſed to goe on land, where I ſuffered him to depart after I had giuen him a ſhirte, and certain ſmall trifles, wherewith he departed very well content with vs. The place where we went on ſhore was hard by a very hie Rocke out of which there ran a litle riuer of ſweet and excellent good water: by which riuer we ſtayed certayne dayes to diſcouer the things which were worthy to bee ſeen, & traficked dayly with the Indians: which aboue all thinges beſought vs that none of our men ſhould come neere their lodgings nor their Gardens, otherwiſe that we ſhould giue them great cauſe of ieloſie, and that in ſo doing wee ſhould not want of their fruit which they call Ananas, whereof they offered vs very liberally, receiuing in recompence certaine things of ſmall value. This notwithſtanding it hapned on a day that certaine of my men, deſirous to ſee ſome new things in theſe ſtrange countries, walked through the woods: and following ſtill the little riuers ſide, they eſpied two Serpents of exceeding bigneſſe, which went ſide by ſide ouerthwarte the way my ſoldiers went before them, thinking to let them from going into the woods: but the ſerpents nothing at all aſtoniſhed with theſe geſtures glaunced into the buſhes with fearefull hiſſings, for all which my men drewe their ſwordes and killed them, and found them afterward nine great foote long, and as bigge as a mans legge. During this combate, certaine others more vndiſcreete went and gathered their Ananas in the Indians Gardens, trampling through them without any diſcretion: and n
                  •
               t therewithall contented they went toward their dwellings, whereat the Indians were ſo much offended, that without regarding any thing they ruſhed vpon them and diſcharged their ſhot ſo that they hit one of my men named Martin Chaueau, which remayned behinde. Wee coulde not knowe whether hee were killed on the place, or whether he were taken priſoner: for thoſe of his company had inough to doe to ſaue themſelues

without thinking of their companion. Whereof Monſur de Ottigni my Lieuetenant being aduertiſed, ſent vnto me to know whether I thought good that he ſhuld lay an ambuſh for the Indians which had either taken or killed our man, or whether hee ſhould goe directly to their dwellinges to knowe the truth. I ſent vnto him, after good delebration hereupon, that hee ſhould not attempt any thing and that for diuers occaſions: but contrariwiſe that he ſhould embarke himſelf with all diligence, and conſequently all they that were on land: which hee did with ſpeede.

After they had made very much of vs, they ſhewed vs their Paracouſſy, that is to ſay, their king and gouernour, to whom I preſented certaine toyes wherewith he was wel pleaſed.

Afterward we tooke our leaue of them, becauſe the night approached, and then returned to lodge in our ſhips. Being allured with this good entertainment I fayled not the next day to embarke my ſelfe agayne with my Lieuetenaunt Ottigni and a number of ſouldiers to returne toward the Paracouſſy of the Riuer of May, which of purpoſe wayted for vs in the ſame place, where the day before we conferred with him. We found him vnder the ſhadow of an Arbour accompanied with foureſcore Indians at the leaſt, and apparelled at that time after the Indian faſhion, to witte, with a great Hartes ſkin dreſſed like Chamoys and painted with deuiſes of ſtrang and diuers colours, but of ſo liuely a portrature and repreſenting antiquitie with rules ſo iuſtly compaſſed, that there is no painter ſo exquiſite that could finde fault therewith: the naturall diſpoſition of this ſtraunge people is ſo perfect and well guided, that without any ayde and fauour of artes, they are able by the helpe of nature onelie to content the eye of artizans, yea euen of thoſe which by their induſtrie are able to aſpire vnto thinges moſt abſolute. Then I aduertiſed Paracouſſy Satourioua, that my deſire was to diſcouer farther vp into the riuer, but that this ſhoulde bee with ſuch diligence that I would come againe vnto him very ſpeedily: wherwith he was content,

promiſing to ſtay for me in the place where hee was: and for an earneſt of his promiſe, he offered me his goodly ſkinne, which I refuſed then, and promiſed to receiue it of him at my returne. For my part I gaue him certaine ſmall trifles, to the intent, to retayne him in our frendſhip. Departing from thence, I had not ſayled three leagues vp the riuer, ſtil being followed by ye Indians, which coſted me along the riuer, crying ſtill, Amy, Amy, that is to ſay, friend, friend: but I diſcouered an hill of meane height, neere which I went on land, hard by the fields that were ſowed with mil, at one corner whereof there was an houſe builte for their lodging, which keepe and garde the mill: for there are ſuch numbers of CorniſheGroſle

I reſted my ſelfe in this place for certayne howers, & commanded Monſur De▪ Otignie andMonſur de Ottigni. my ſergeant to enter into the woods to ſearch out the dwellings of the Indians: where, after they had gone a whyle, they came vnto a Mariſh of Reeds, where finding their way to be ſtopped, they reſted vnder the ſhadow of a migtie Bay tree to refreſh themſelues a litle, and to reſolue which way to take. Then they diſcouered, as it were on the ſodaine, fiue Indians halfe hidden in the woods, which ſeemed ſomewhat to diſtruſt our men, vntill they ſaid vnto them in y• Indian language Antipola Bonaſſou, to the end that vnderſtanding their ſpeech, they might come vnto vs more boldly, which they did incontinently, But becauſe they ſawe, that the foure that went laſt bare vp the traine of the ſkin wherewith hee that went foremoſt was apparelled, our men imagined that the foremoſt muſt needs be ſome man of greater qualitie then the reſt, ſeeing that withall they called him Paracouſſy, Paracouſſy, wherefore ſome of our companie went towardes him, and vſing him courteouſlie ſhewed him Monſur De Ottigny their lieuetenāt, for whom they had made an arbour with Bay and Palme boughes after y• Indiā faſhiō, to ye end y• by ſuch ſignes y• ſauages might think yt the Frēchmen had cōpaniedThe curteſie of the Floridians to the French. wt ſuch as they at other times.

ſkinne, that he was clad withall. Then he tooke him by the hande, leading him right toward the mariſhes, ouer which the Paracouſſy, Monſieur Ottigni, and certaine other of our men were borne vpon the Indians ſhoulders: and the reſt which could not paſſe becauſe of the mire and reedes, went through the woods, and followed ſtil a narrow path which led them forth vntil they came vnto the Paracouſſyes dwelling: out of which there came about fiftie Indians to receiue our men gallantly, and to feaſt them after their manner. After which they brought at their entraunce a great veſſell of earth, made after a ſtrange faſhion full of fountaine water cleere and very excellent. This veſſel was borne by an Indian, and there was another younger which bare of this water in another little veſſell of wood, and preſented thereof to euery one to drinke, obſeruing in doing the ſame, a certaine order and reuerence, which hee made to each of them, to whom he gaue drinke. Our thirſt well quenched by this meane, and our men being ſufficiently refreſhed, the Paracouſſy brought them to his fathers lodging, one of the oldeſt men that liued on the earth. Our men regarding his age, began to make much of him, vſing this ſpeech, Amy, Amy, that is to ſay, friend, friende, whereat y• old fier ſhewed himſelfe very glad. Afterwarde they queſtioned with him concerning the courſe of his age, whervnto he made anſweare, ſhewing y• he was the firſt liuing originall, frō whence 5. generations were deſcēded, as he ſhewed vnto thē by another old mā that ſate directly ouer againſt him, which far exceeded him in age. And this man was his father, which ſeemed to be rather a dead carcaſſe then a liuing body. For he had his ſinewes, his veins his artiers, his bones, and other parts, appearing ſo cleerely thorow his ſkin, that a mā might eaſely tel thē, & diſcern them one from another. Alſo his age was ſo great, that y• good man had loſt his ſight, & could not ſpeak one onely word but wt exceeding great paine. Monſieur de Ottigni hauing ſeen ſo ſtrāge a thing, turned to the yoūger of theſe 2. old men, praying him to vouchſafe to anſwere him to that which he demāded touching his age. Then the old man called a cō

But though this

old man had his father aliue more old than himſelfe, and that both of them did weare their haire very long and as white as was poſſible: yet it was tolde them, that they might yet liue thirtie or fortie yeeres more by the courſe of nature: although the younger of them both was not leſſe then two hundred and fiftie yeeres olde.

He cauſed alſo little Paniers made of Palme leaues full of gourds red and blew to be deliuered vnto them. For recompence of which preſents he was ſatiſfied with French toyes. The two old men cauſed our men to bee guided backe againe to the place from whence they came, by the young Parracouſſy which had brought them thither. And hauing taken leaue of the Paracouſſy they came and ſought me out in the place where I ſtayed, and rehearſed vnto me all that they had ſeene, praying me alſo that I would reward their guide, which ſo frankly and heartily had receiued them into his houſe, which I would not fayle to doe by any meanes. Now was I determined to ſearch out the qualities of the Hill. Therfore I went right to the top therof, where we found nothingCeders, Palmes, bayes exceeding ſweete. elſe but Cedars, Palme, and Baytrees of ſo ſoueraine odour, y• Baulme ſmelleth nothing like in compariſon. The trees were enuironed roūd about wt Vines bearing Grapes in ſuch quantity that the number would ſuffice to make the place habitable.

After I had ſtayed there a while, I embarked againe my people to ſayle towardes the mouth of the Riuer, where we found the Paracouſſy which according to his promiſe wayted for vs. Wherefore to content him we went on ſhore and did him that reuerence that on our part was requiſite: Then he gaue me the ſkin ſo richly painted, & I recompenſed him with ſomewhat of our marchandiſe. I forgat not to demaund of him the place whence the wedge of ſiluer came which he had giuen me before: whereunto he made me a very ſuddayne

aunſweare, which notwithſtanding I vnderſtood not, which he well perceiued. And then hee ſhewed me by euident ſignes thatSyluer certayn dayes iournie vp within the riuer of May. all of it came from a place more within the riuer by certayne dayes iournies from this place, and declared vnto vs that al y• which they had thereof they gat it by force of armes of the inhabitants of this place named by them Thimogoua, their moſt auncient and n

Whereupon when I ſawe with what affection he ſpake, when he pronounced Thimogoua, I vnderſtood what hee would ſaye. And to bring my ſelfe more into his fauour I promiſed him to accompany him with all my force, if he would fight againſt them: which thing pleaſed him in ſuch ſorte that from thence foorth, he promiſed himſelfe the victorie of them, and aſſured me that he would make a voyage thither within a ſhort ſpace, would cauſe ſtore of Mill to be prepared, and would commaund his men to make ready their bowes, and furniſh themſelues with ſuch ſtore of arrowes, that nothing ſhould be wanting to giue battayle to Thimogoua. In fine he prayed me very earneſtly not to fayle of my promiſe, and in ſo doing, hee hoped to procure me gold and ſiluer in ſuch good quantitie that my affayres ſhould take effecte according to mine own and his deſire. The matter thus fully reſolued vpon, I tooke my leaue of him to returne vnto my ſhips, where after we had reſted our ſelues all the night following we hoyſed ſayles the next day very early in the morning, and ſayled toward the Riuer of Seine, diſtant from the Riuer ofThe riuer of Seine.

After that ye 
               Paracouſſy had receiued vs, as I haue ſaid, he commaunded

his wife to preſent me with a certaine number of bullets of ſiluer,Bullets of ſiluer. for his owne parte he preſented me with his Bowe and his Arrowes, as he had done vnto Captayne Iohn Ribault in our firſt voyage, which is a ſigne of perpetuall amitie and aliance with thoſe which they honour with ſuch a kinde of preſent. In our diſcourſing with one another wee entred into ſpeech as touching the exerciſe of armes. Then the Paracouſſy cauſed a Corſelet to be ſet on end, and prayed me to make a proofe of our Harkubuſies and their bowes: but this proofe pleaſed him very little, for aſſoone as he knew that our Harkubuſes did eaſily perce that which al the force of their bowes could not hurte, he ſeemed to be ſorie, muſing with himſelfe how this thing might be done. Neuertheleſſe going about to diſſemble in his mind, that which his coūtenance could not doe by any meanes, he began to fall into another matter, and prayed vs very earneſtly to ſtay with him that night in his houſe or lodging, affirming that no greater happineſſe could come vnto him then our long aboad, which he deſired to recompence with a thouſand preſents. Neuertheleſſe we cold not graunt him this poynt, but tooke our leaue of him, to returne to our ſhips: WhereLaudonieres conſultation with his company where it might be beſt for them to plant. ſoone after I cauſed al my company to be aſſembled with the maiſters and Pilots of my ſhippes to conſult together of the place whereof we ſhould make choyſe to plant our habitation. Firſt I let them vnderſtand, how none of them were ignorant, that the parte which was towarde the Cape of Florida, was altogether a mariſh Countrey, and therefore vnprofitable for our inhabitation: A thing which cold yeeld neither profit to the king nor any contentment or pleaſure to vs, if peraduenture we would inhabite there. On the other ſide if we paſſed farther towarde the North to ſeeke out Port Royall, it would bee neither verye profitable nor conuenient: at the leaſt if wee would giue credit to the reporte of them which remayned there a long time, although the Hauen were one of the fayreſt of the Weſt Indies: but that in this caſe the queſtion was not ſo much of the beautie of the place, as of thinges neceſſary to ſuſtayne life. And that at our firſt inhabiting it was muche more needefull for vs to plant in places plentifull of victualle, then in goodly Hauens, fayre deepe and pleaſant to the vewe, In conſideration whereof that I was of opinion, if it ſeemed good vnto them to ſeate our ſelues

After that I had propoſed theſe things euery one gaue his opinion thereof: and in fiue all reſolued, namely thoſe which had beene with me in the firſt voyage, that it was expedient to ſeate themſelues rather on the riuer of May, then on any other, vntill they might heare newes out of Fraunce. This point thus being agreed vpon wee ſayled toward the riuer, and vſed ſuch diligence, that with the fauour of the windes we arriued there the morrow after about the breake of day, which was on a Thurſeday the 29. of the moneth ofIune the 29. Iune. Hauing caſt Anker, I embarked al my ſtuffe and the ſoldiers of my company, to ſayle right toward the opening of the riuer: wherein we entred a good way vp, and found a creake of a reſonable vigneſſe, which inuited vs to refreſh our ſelues a little, while we repoſed our ſelues there. Afterward we went on ſhore to ſeeke out a place plaine without trees, which wee perceiued from the creeke. But becauſe we found it not very commodious for vs to inhabite there: we determined to returne vnto the place which we had diſcouered before, when we had ſayled vp the Riuer. This place is ioyning to a mountayne, and it ſeemed vnto vs more fit and commodious to builde a fortreſſe, then that where we were laſt. Therefore we tooke our way towards the foreſts being guided therein by the young Paracouſſy which had led vs before vnto his fathers lodging. Afterward we found a large plaine couered with high pinetrees diſtant a little one from ye other: vnder which we perceiued an infinite number of Stagges which braied amidſt the plaine, a thwarte the which we paſſed: then we diſcouered a little hil adioyning vnto a great vale very greene and in forme flat: wherein were the fayreſt medowes of the world and graſſe to feed cattell.

water, wherwith ſhe greatly refreſhed vs. For we were exceeding fainte by reaſon of the ardent heate which moleſted vs as we paſſed through thoſe high woods. And I beleeue that without the ſuccour of that Indian Hermaphrodite, or rather if it had not been for the great deſire which we had to make vs reſolute of our ſelues we had taken vp our lodging all night in ye wood. Being therfore refreſhed by this meane, we gathered our ſprites together, & marching with a cheerefull courage, we came to the place which wee had choſen to make our habitation in: whereon at that inſtant neere the Riuers brinke we ſtrowed a number of boughes & leaues to take our reſt on them the night following, which we found exceeding ſweete, becauſe of the payne which the day before we had taken in our trauell.

The prayers ended euery man began to take courage. Afterward hauing meaſured out a piece of ground in forme of a triangle wee endeuored our ſelues of all ſides, ſome to bring earth ſome to cut Fagots, and others to rayſe and make the rampyre, for there was not a man that had not either a ſhouel, or cutting hook, or hatchet aſwel to make the ground plaine by cutting down the trees, as for the building of the Fort, which we did haſten with ſuch cheerefulneſſe that within few dayes the effect of our diligence was apparant: In which meane ſpace the Paracouſſy Satourioua our neereſt neighbour, and on whoſe ground we built our fort, came vſually accompanied with his two ſonnes and a great number of Indians to offer to do vs al curteſie. And I likewiſe for my part beſtowed diuers of our trifles frākly on him to thend he might know ye goodwil which we bare him, & therby make him more deſirous of our friēdſhip, in ſuch ſort y• as ye dayes increaſed ſo our amity & friēdſhip increaſed alſo: After yt our fort was brought into forme, I begā

In the middeſt I cauſed a great court to be made of eighteene paſes long and broad, in the middeſt whereof on the one ſide drawing toward the South I builded a Corpes de gard, and an houſe on the other ſide toward the North, which I cauſed to be rayſed ſomwhat to high: for within a ſhoreHigh building is not good for this countrey. while after the winde beat it downr: and experience taught me, that we may not build with high ſtages in this countrey, by reaſon of the winds whereunto it is ſubiect.

the riuer what this Thimogoua might be, whereof the Paracouſſy Satourioua had ſpoken to vs ſo often at our comming on ſhore. For execution hereof the Paratouſſy gaue him two Indians for his guides, which taking vpon them to lead him in this voyage ſeemed to goe vnto a wedding, ſo deſirous they were to fight with their enemies. Being embarked they hoyſed ſayle and hauing ſayled aboutThe firſt voyage twentie leagues twentie leagues, the Indians which ſtill looked on this ſide and that ſide to eſpie ſome of their enimies, diſcouered three Canoes. And immediately they began to crie Thimogoua, Thimogoua, and ſpake of nothing elſe but to haſten forward to goe to fight wt them: which the Captayne ſeemed to be willing to doe, to content them. When they came to boorde them, one of the Indians gat holde of an Halbert, another of a Coutelas in ſuch a rage that hee would haue lept into the water to haue fought with them alone. Neuertheleſſe Ottigny would not let them doe it, for while he differed to abord them he gaue the others reſpit to turne the prooes of their Canoes toward the ſhore and ſo to eſcape into the woods. Againe the meaning of Ottigny was not to make warre vpon them of Thimogoua▪
                but rather to make them friendes; and to make them thencefoorth to liue in peace one with another if it were poſſible, hoping by this meane to diſcouer daily ſome new thing, & eſpecially the certayne courſe of the Riuer. For this purpoſe hee cauſed the barke to retire wherein were the two Indians his guides, & went with his toward the Canoes which were on the Riuers ſide. Being come vnto them, he put certaine trifles into them, and then retired a goodway from them, which thing cauſed the Indians which were fled away to rerurne to their Boates, and to vnderſtand by this ſigne, that thoſe of our barke were none of their enimies, but rather come onely to trafficke with them. Wherefore being thus aſſured of vs they called to our men to come neere vnto them: which they did incontinently and ſet foote on lande, and ſpake freely with them, with diuerſe ceremonies ouer long to recount. In the end Ottigni demaunded of them by ſignes if they had gold or ſiluer among them. But they told him they had none as then: and that if he would ſend one of his men with thē, they would bring him without daunger into a place where they might haue ſome. Ottigni ſeeing them ſo willing, deliuered them one of his men which ſeemed very reſolute to vndertake this voyage: this fellow ſtayed with thē vntill ten of the clocke the next day morning, ſo that Captayne Ottigny
               
ſomewhat offended with his long ſtaye, ſayled tenne greatTen leagues farther. leagues farther vp the riuer: although he knew not what way hee ſhould goe, yet he went ſo farre vp that he eſpied the boate wherein his ſouldier was: which reported vnto him that the Indians would haue carried him three great dayes iourney farther, & told him that a king named Mayrra rich in gold and ſiluer dwelt in thoſe quarters,Mayrra a king rich in gold & ſiluer. and that for ſmall quantitie of marchandiſe inough might be had of him: yet that he would not hazard himſelf without his leaue, and that he brought but a very litle gold. This being done our men returned toward our fort Caroline after they had left the ſouldier with the Indians to enforme himſelfe more and more of ſuch things as he might diſcouer more at leaſure. Fifteene dayes after this voyage to Thimogoua, I diſpatched Captaine Vaſſeur and my ſergeantThe ſecond voyage. alſo, to returne againe into this countrey and to ſeeke out the ſouldier which remayned there in y• former voyage. Being therfore imbarked they ſayled two whole dayes: and before they came to the dwelling of the Indians, they found two of them on the riuers ſide, which were expreſſely ſent vnto that place to diſcry whether any of their enimies were come to that parte, with intention to ſurpriſe them, as they did vſually. When they perceiued Captaine Valſeur they knewe incontinently that he was none of their enimies, & therefore made no difficultie to come neere vnto the barke, and ſhewed him by ſignes that the ſouldier which they ſought was not in that place, but was at that preſent in the houſe of king Molloua
               King molloua. which was vaſſell vnto another great king named by them Olata Ouae Vtina: and that if the Captayne would ſayle thytherward,Olata Ouae Vtina a great king. he ſhould come thither very quickly, wherewith he was content, & cauſed his men to rowe to that part which the Indians ſhewed him: wherat they were ſo glad that they ran quickly before by land to declare his arriuall, which was at the lodging of king Molloua, after that he had rowed not paſt halfe a league. While king Molloua had ended intertayning Captayne Vaſſeur and his men, the ſouldier came in with f

               Olata Ouae Vtina. This done, he went about likewiſe to diſcouer the enemies of Ouae Vtina, in which number he placed as the firſt the Paracouſſy Satourioua monarch of the confines of the riuer of May, which hath vnder his obeyſace thirty other Paracouſſies, whereof there were ten which were al his brethren, and that therefore he was greatly eſteemed in thoſe parties: then he named three others no leſſe puiſſant than Satourioua, whereof the firſt dwelt two dayes iourney from his Lord Olate Oure Vtina, and ordinarily made warre vpon him, whoſe name was Potanou, a manKing Potanou. cruell in warre, but pitiful in the execution of his furie. For he took the priſoners to mercy, beeing content to marke them on the left arme, with a great marke like vnto a ſeale, and ſo imprinted as if it had beene touched with an hoate yron, then he let them goe without doing them any other hurt. The two others were named Onatheaqua,
               An exceeding rich place. and Houſtaqua, being great Lordes, and abounding in riches, and principally Onatheaqua, which dwelt neere vnto the high mountaines, wherein there was aboundance of many rare thinges, and infinite quantitie of a kinde of ſlate ſtone, wherwith they made wedges to cleaue their wood. The occaſion which (as he ſayde) moued Potanou to wage war againſt Olata Ouaé Vtina, was the feare that hee had, leaſt hee and his companions ſhoulde get of that hard ſtone in his countrey, wherewith they headed their arrowes, and coulde not get it in any neerer place. Beſides all this, Molloua recited to Captaine Vaſſeur, that the kinges alies the vaſſals of great Olata, armed their breaſtes, armes, thighes, legges, andLarge plats of golde and filuer. foreheades with large plates of golde and ſiluer: and that by this meanes the arrowes that were diſcharged vpon them could do them no manner of hurt at all, but rather were broken againſt them. Heerevpon Captaine Vaſſeur inquired whether the kinges Onatheaqua and Honſtaqua were like vnto vs. For by the deſcription that they made of them, hee beganne t

                doubt whether theySome paint their faces with blacke, & ſome with

                  ed. were Spaniards or no: but Molloua tolde him that they were not, but that they were Indians like the reſt, ſauing that they paynted their faces with blacke, and that the reſt as Moloua painted it with redde. Then my Lieuetenaunt Vaſſeur, and my ſergeant

promiſed him that one day I ſhold march with my foroes into thoſe countries, and that ioyning my ſelfe with his Lord Olata, I would ſubdue the inhabitants of the higheſt of thoſe mountaines. Hee was very glad of this ſpeech, and anſwered that the leaſt of theſe kings which he had named, ſhould preſent vnto the generall of theſe ſuccours the height of two foot of gold & ſiluer, which by force of arms they had already gotten of thoſe two kings, Onatheaqua, and Houſtaqua. The good cheere being done, and the diſcourſes ended, my men embarked themſelues againe with intention to bring me thoſe good newes vnto the fort Caroline. But after they had ſayled a very long while downe the riuer, and were come within three leagues of vs, the tide was ſo ſtrong againſt them, that they were conſtrayned to goe on land, and to retire themſelues becauſe of the night vnto the dwelling of a certain Paracouſſy named Molona, which ſhewedKing Molona. himſelfe very glad of their arriual: for he deſired to know ſome newes of Thimogoua, and thought that the French men went thither for none other occaſion but for to inuade them. Which captain Vaſſeur perceiuing diſſembled ſo wel, that he made him beleeue y• he went to Thimogoua, wt none other intentiō, but to ſubdue them, & to deſtroy them with the edge of y• ſword without mercy, but that their purpoſe had not ſuch ſucceſſe as they deſired, becauſe y• the people of Thimogoua being aduertiſed of this enterpriſe, retired into y• woods, & ſaued themſelues by flight: y• neuertheleſſe they had taken ſome as they were flying away which carried no newes therof vnto their fellowes. The Paracouſſy was ſo glad of this relation, that he enterrupted him, and aſked Vaſſeur of the beginning & maner of his execution, & praied him that he would ſhew him by ſignes how all things paſſed. Immediatly Frauncis la Caille the ſergeant of my band took his ſword in his hand, ſaying that with the point thereof he had thruſt through two Indiās which ran into the woods, & y• his cōpaniōs had done no leſſe for their parts. And that if fortune had ſo fauoured them, that they had not bin diſcouered by the mē of Thimogoua, they had had a victorie moſt glorious & worthy of eternall memory. Herevpon the Paracouſſy ſhewed himſelfe ſo wel ſatiſfied, that he could not deuiſe how to gratifie our men, which he cauſed t
                  •
                come into his houſe to feaſt thē more honorably: & hauing made captaine Vaſſeur to ſit next him, and in his own chaire (which the Indians eſteeme for the chiefeſt honour) & then vnderneath him two of

his ſonnes, goodly and mighty fellowes, he commanded al the reſt to place thēſelues as they thought good. This done, y• Indians came according to their good cuſtom, to preſent their drink Caſsine to the Paracouſſy, & then to certaine of his chiefeſt friends, & the Frenchmen. Then he which brought it ſet the cup aſide, & drew out a little dagger which hung ſtucke vp in the roofe of the houſe, & like a mad man he lift his head aloft, & ran apace, & went and ſmote an Indian which ſate alone in one of the corners of the hall, crying with a loud voyce, Hyou, the poore Indian ſtirring not at al for the blow, which he ſeemed to eudure paciētly. He which held the dagger went quickly to put the ſame in his former place, & begā again to giue vs drink, as he did before: but he had not long continued, & had ſcarcely giuen 3. or 4. thereof, but he left his bowle againe, tooke the dagger in his hand, & quickly returned vnto him which he had ſtroken before, to whom he gaue a very ſore blow on the ſide, crying Hyou, as he had done before: then he went to put the dagger in his place, and ſet him ſelf down among the reſt. A litle while after, he y• had bin ſtroken fel down backwards, ſtretching out his armes and legs as if he had bin ready to yeld vp the latter gaſpe. And then the younger ſonne of the Paracouſſy apparrelled in a long white ſkin, fel down at the feet of him that was fallen backward, weeping bitterly halfe a quarter of an houre: after two other of his brethren clad in like apparel, came about him that was ſo ſtricken, & began to ſigh pitifully. Their mother bearing a litle infant in her armes came from another part, and going to the place where her ſonnes were, at the firſt ſhe vſed infinit numbers of outcries, then one while lifting vp her eies to heauen, an other while falling down vnto the groūd, ſhe cried ſo dolefully, that her lamentable mournings would haue moued the moſt hard & ſtonie heart in the world with pity. Yet this ſufficed not, for there came in a company of young gyrles which did neuer lyn weeping for a long while in the place where the Indian was fallē down, whō afterward they took, & with the ſaddeſt geſtures they could deuiſe, caried him away into another houſe a little way of from the great hal of the Paracouſſy, & continued their weepings & mournings by the ſpace of two long houres: in which meane while the Indians ceaſſed not to drink Caſſine, but wt ſuch ſilence that one word was not heard in the parler. Vaſſeur beeing grieued that hee vnderſtood not theſe ceremonies, demaunded of the Paracouſſy what theſe thinges meant: which anſwered him ſlowly, Thimogoua, Thimogoua, with

out ſaying any more. Beeing more diſpleaſed then he was before with ſo ſlight an anſweare, he turned vnto another Indian the Paracouſſyes brother, who was a Paracouſſy as well as his brother, called Malica, which made him a like anſwere as he did at the firſt,King Malica. praying him to aſke no more of theſe matters, and to haue patience for that time. The ſubtile old Paracouſſy praied him within a while after to ſhew him his ſword, which he would not deny him, thinking that hee would haue behelde the faſhion of his weapons: but he ſoone perceiued that it was to another end: for the old mā holding it in his hand, beheld it a long while on euery place to ſee if he could find any blood vpon it which might ſhew that any of their enemies had bin killed: (for the Indians are woont to bring their weapons wherwith their enemies haue bin defeated with ſome blood vpō thē, for a token of their victories.) But ſeeing no ſigne thereof vpon it, he was vpon the point to ſay vnto him, that he had killed none of the mē of Thimogoua, whē as Vaſſeur preuēting that which he might obiect, declared & ſhewed to him by ſignes y• maner of his enterpriſe, adding that by reaſon of the 2.

                was ſo bloudy, that he was inforced to waſh & make it cleane a long while in the riuer: which the old man beleeued to be like to be true, and made no maner of reply therevnto. Vaſſeur, la Caille, and their other companions went out of the hall to go into the roome whitherTapiſtry made of ſmall reeds. they had carried the Indian: there they found the Paracouſſy ſitting vpon tapiſtries made of ſmal reeds, which was at meat after y• Indian faſhion, & the Indian that was ſmitten hard by him, lying vpō the ſelfſame tapiſtry, about whom ſtood the wife of the Paracouſſy, with all the young damſels which before bewailed him in the hall: which did nothing els but warme a great deale of moſſe in ſteede ofThey lappe moſſe about their woundes and vſe it inſteed of napkins.

Herevpō our men aſked the Paracouſſy again, for what occaſiō the Indian was ſo perſecuted in his preſēce: he anſwered, y• this was nothing els but a kind of ceremony whereby they would cal to mind y• death & perſecutiōs of y• 
               Paracouſſies their anceſtors executed by their enemy Thimogoua: alledging moreouer, that as oftē as he himſelf, or any of his friends & alies returned frō the countrey, without they brought the heads of their enimies, or without bringing home ſome priſoner, he vſed for a perpetual memory of al his predeceſſors, to beate the beſt beloued of all his children, with the ſelfſame weapons, wherewith they had bin killed in times paſt: to the ende that by renewing of the wounde their

death ſhould be lamented afreſh. Now when they were thus informed of thoſe ceremonies they thanked the Paracouſſy for their good entertainement which they had receiued, and ſo ſetting ſaile came to me vnto the fort: where they declared all vnto me as I haue recited it heretofore. The eight and tweentieth of IulieThe returne of their ſhips toward France the 28. of Iuly our ſhippes departed to returne into France. And with in a while, about two monethes after our arriuall in Florida, the Paracouſſy Satourioüa ſent certaine Indians vnto me to know whether I would ſtand to my promiſe which I had made him at my firſt arriuall in that countrie, which was that I would ſhew my ſelfe friend to his friendes and enemie vnto his enemies, and alſo to accompanie him with a good number of Hargabuſhes, when he ſhould ſee it expedient, and ſhould finde a fit occaſion to goe to warre: nowe ſeeing he reſted vpon this promiſe, he prayed me not to deferre the ſame: ſeeing alſo that making accompt thereof he had taken ſuch good order for the execution of his enterpriſe, that he was readie, and was furniſhed with all thinges that were neceſſarie for the voyage. I made him aunſwere that for his amitie I would not purchaſe the enmitie of the other, and that albeit I would, yet notwithſtanding I wanted meanes to doe it. For it behooued me at that preſent to make prouiſion of victuals and munitiō for the defence of my fort. On the otherſide that my Barkes were nothing readie, and that this enterpriſe woulde require time: moreouer that the Paracouſſy Satourioua might holde himſelfe readie to depart within two monethes, and that then I would thinke of fulfilling my promiſe to him. The Indians carried this anſwere to their Paracouſſy, which was litle pleaſed withit, becauſe he could not deferre his execution or expedition, aſwell becauſe all his victuals were readie, as alſo becauſe tenne other Paracouſſies were aſſembled with him for the performance of this enterpriſe. The ceremonie which thisThe ceremonie which they vſe before they goe to warre. ſauage vſed before hee embarked his armie deſerueth not to bee forgotten. For when hee was ſet downe by the riuers ſide, being compaſſed about with tenne other Paracouſſies he commanded water to be brought him ſpeedily. This done, looking vp into heauen hee fell to diſcourſe of diuerſe thinges with geſtures that ſhewed him to bee in exceeding great cholere, which made him one while ſhake his head hither and thither, and by and by

with I wote not what furie to turne his face towarde the countrey of his enemies, and to threaten to kill them. He often times looked vpon the ſonne praying him to graunt him a glorious victorie of his enemies: Which when he had done by the ſpace of halfe an howre, he ſprinkled with his hand a little of the water which he held in a veſſell vpon the heads of the Paracouſſies, and caſt the reſt as it were in a rage and deſpite into a fire which was there prepared for the purpoſe. This done he cried out thriſe, He Thimogoüa, and was followed with fiue hundred IndiansSatourioua followed with fiue hū
                  dred Indians. at the leaſt, which were there aſſembled, which cried all with one voyce, He Thimogoüa. This ceremonie, as a certaine Indian tolde me familiarly, ſignified nothing elſe, but that Satourioüa beſought the ſonne to graunt vnto him ſo happie a victorie that he might ſhed his enemies bloud, as he had ſhed that water at his pleaſure: moreouer that the Paracouſſies which were ſprinkled with a part of that water, might returne with the heades of their enimies, which is the onely and chiefe triumph of their victories. The Paracouſſy Satourioüa had no ſooner ended his ceremonies and had taken a viewe of all his companye, but he embarked himſelfe, and vſed ſuch diligence with his Almadies or boates, that the next daye two houres before the ſonnes ſet, hee arriued on the territories of his enemies aboute eight or ten leages from their villages: Afterward cauſing them all to goe on lande he aſſembled his counſel, wherein it was agreed that fiue of the Paracouſſies ſhoulde ſaile vp the riuer with halfe of theConſultation before they aſſault their enemies. troupes and by the breake of daye ſhould approch vnto the dwelling of their enemie: for his owne parte that he woulde take his iorney through the woodes and foreſts as ſecretly as hee coulde: that when they were come thither, as wel they that went by water as he which went by land ſhoulde not faile by the breake of the daye to enter into the village, & cut them all in peeces except the women and little children. Theſe things which were thus agreed vppon were executed with as greate furie as was poſſible: whichHow they vſe their enimies which they take in warre. when they had done they took the heades of their enemies which they had ſlaine and cut of their heire round about with a piece of their ſkuls: they tooke alſo foure and twentie priſoners, which they led awaye, and retired themſelues immediatlye vnto their boates which waited for them: being come thither they beganne

to ſing prayſes vnto the ſunne to whome they attributed their victorie. And afterwardes put the ſkins of their heades on the end of their iauelinges, and went altogether toward the territories of Paracouſſy Omoloa, one of them which was in the companie:King Omoloa being come thither they deuided their priſoners equallie to ech of the Paracouſſies, & left thirtéene of them to Satourioüa, which ſtraightway diſpatched an Indian his ſubiecte, to carrie newes before of the victorie to them which ſtaied at home to gard their houſes, which immediatly beganne to wéepe: But aſſone as night was come they neuer left dancing and playing a thouſande gambols in honour of the feaſt. The next day the Paracouſſy Satourioüa came home, who before he entred into his lodging cauſed al the heirie ſkuls of his enemies to be ſet vp beforeThe maner of triumphe. his doore and crowned them with branches of Lawrell, ſhewing by this glorious ſpectacle the triumph of the victorie which hee had obtayned. Straightway beganne lamentation and mourninges, which aſſoone as the night began were turned into pleaſures and dances. After that I was aduertiſed of theſe things, I ſent a ſoldier vnto Satourioüa praying him to ſende me two of his priſoners: which hee denied me, ſaying that hee was nothing beholding vnto me, and that I had broken my promiſe, againſt the oath which I had ſworne vnto him at my arriuall. Which when I vnderſtoode by my ſoldier, which was come backe with ſpeéde, I deuiſed howe I might be reuenged of this ſauage, and to make him knowe howe dearely this bolde brauado of his ſhoulde coſt him: therefore I commanded my ſergiant to prouide me twentie ſoldiers to goe with mee to the houſe of Satourioüa: Where after I was come and entered into the hall without any manner of ſalutation, I went and ſate mee downe by him and ſtayed a long while without ſpeaking any worde vnto him, nor ſhewing him any ſigne of friendſhip, which thing put him deépely in his domps: beſides that certaine ſoldiers remained at the gate, to whome I had giuen expreſſe commandement to ſuffer no Indian to goe foorth: hauing ſtoode ſtill about halfe an houre with this countenaunce, at length I demaunded where the priſoners were, which hee hadde taken at Thomogoua, and commaunded them preſentlie to be brought vnto mee. Wherevnto the Paracouſſy angrie at the hearte and aſtonyed wonderfully

ſtoode a long while without making any anſwere, notwithſtanding at laſt he anſwered me verie ſtoutly that being affraide to ſeé vs comming thither in ſuch warrelike manner they fled into the woods, and that not knowing which way they were gone they were not able by any meanes to bring them againe, Then I ſeemed to make as though I vnderſtoode not what hee ſaide, and aſked for his priſoners againe, and for ſome of his principall allies. Then Satourioüa commanded his ſonne Athore to ſeéke out the priſoners, and to cauſe them to be broughtAthore. into that place, which thing he did within an houre after. After they were come to the lodging of the Paracouſſy, they humblie ſaluted me, & lifting vp their handes before me, they would haue fallen downe proſtrate as it were at my feét: but I would not ſuffer them, and ſoone after led them away with mee vnto my owne force. The Paracouſſy, being wonderfully offended with this brauado, bethought himſelfe by all meanes how he might be reuenged of vs. But to giue vs no ſuſpition thereof, and the better to couer his intention, he ſent his meſſengers oftentimes vnto vs bringing alwaies with them ſome kinde of preſentes. Among others one day hee ſent threé Indians, which brought vsExcellent Pompions. two baſkets full of great Pompions, much more excellent then thoſe which we haue in France, and promiſed me in their kinges behalfe that during mine aboade in that countrie I ſhoulde neuer want victuals: I thanked them for their kings good will, and ſignified vnto them the great deſire which I had, aſwell for the benefit of Satourioüa, as for the quiet of his ſubiectes, to make a peace betweéne him and thoſe of Thimogoüa: which thing could not chooſe but turne to their great benefite, ſeeing that being allied with the kings of thoſe partes, he had an open paſſage againſt Onatheaqua his auncient enemie, which otherwiſe he coulde not ſet vpon: Moreouer that Olata Oaüe Vtina was ſo mightie a Paracouſſy, that Satourioüa was not able to withſtande his forces: but being agreed together they might eaſily ouerthrowe all their enemies, and might paſſe the confines of the fartheſt riuers that were towards the South. The meſſengers praied me to haue patience vntill the morrowe, at what time they woulde come agayne vnto mee to certifie mee of their lordes inclination: which they fayled not to doe, aduertiſing mee that Paracouſſy
               
               Satourioua was the gladdeſt man in the worlde to treate of this accorde (although in deede he was quite contrarie) and that hee beſought me to be diligent therein, promiſing to obſerue & performe whatſoeuer I ſhould agreé vpon with thoſe of Thimogoüa: which thinges the meſſengers alſo rehearſed vnto the priſoners which I had led away. After they were departed I reſolued within two dayes to ſende backe againe the priſoners to Olata Ouae Vtina, whoſe ſubiectes they were: but before I embarked them, I gaue them certaine ſmale trifles, which were litle kniues or tablets of glaſſe, wherein the image of King Charles the ninth was drawen verie liuely, for which they gaue mee verie great thankes, as alſo for the honeſt entertainment which was giuen them at the fort Caroline: after this they embarked themſelues, with captaine Vaſſeur, & with monſur De Arlac mine enſigne which I had ſent of purpoſe to remaine a certaine time with Ouae Vtina, hoping that the fauour of this great Paracouſſy would ſerue my turne greatly to make my diſcoueries in time to come. I ſent with him alſo one of my ſergeantes, and ſixe gallant ſoldiers. Thus things paſſed on this manner, and the hatred of Paracouſſy Satourioua agaynſt me did ſtill continue, vntill that on the 29. of Auguſt a lightning from heauenA wonderfull lightning the 29. of Auguſt. fell within halfe a league of our forte, more worthie I beleéue, to be wondred at, & to be put in writing, then all the ſtrang ſignes which haue beéne ſeéne in times paſt, and whereof the hiſtories haue neuer written. For although the medowes were at that ſeaſon all greéne, and halfe couered ouer with water, neuertheleſſe the lightning in one inſtant conſumed aboue fiue hundred acres therewith, and burned with the ardent heate thereof all the foules which tooke their paſtime in the medowes, which thing continued for threé dayes ſpace, which cauſed vs not a little to muſe, not able to iudge whereof this fire proceéded: for one while wee thought that the Indians had burnt their houſes, and abandoned their places for feare of vs: another while wee thought that they had diſcouered ſome ſhips in the ſea, and that according to their cuſtome they had kindled many fires here and there to ſignifie that their countrie was inhabited: neuertheleſſe being not aſſured, I determined to ſende to Paracouſſy Serranay

Therefore conſidering the ſeruiceable affection that he bare vnto mee, hee founde it very ſtrange, that I thus diſcharged myne ordinance againſt his dwelling,The ſauages thinke the lightning to be diſcharging of the Chriſtians ordinance. which had burnt vp an infinite ſight of greéne medowes, and conſumed euen downe vnto the bottome of the water, and came ſo neére vnto his manſion that heé thought heé ſawe the fire in his houſe: wherefore heé beſought meé moſt humblie to commaunde my men that they woulde not ſhoote any more towardes his lodging, otherwiſe that hereafter heé ſhould beé conſtrayned to abandon his countrey, and to retyre himſelfe into ſome place more farther of from vs. Hauing vnderſtood the fooliſh opinion of this man, which notwithſtanding could not chooſe but beé very profitable for vs, I diſſembled what I thought thereof for that time, and aunſwered the Indians with a cheérefull countenaunce, that the relation, which they made vnto meé of the obedience of their Paracouſſy, did pleaſe meé right well, becauſe that before heé had not behaued himſelfe in ſuch ſort towardes meé, eſpecially when I ſommoned him to ſende meé the priſoners of great Olata Ouae Vtina which heé detained, whereof notwithſtanding hee made no great accompt, which was the principall cauſe wherefore I had diſcharged myne ordinaunce againſt him: not that I meant to reach vnto his houſe, as I might haue done eaſily, if itLaudonnlere vſed the preſent occaſion to his profite. had pleaſed meé, but that I was content to ſhoote the halfe waye to make him knowe my force: aſſuring him furthermore, that on condition that heé would continue in his good affection, no more ordinance ſhoulde be diſcharged againſt him hereafter: and beſides that I would become his faithfull protectour againſt his greateſt enimies.

From this place they rowed to the dwelling of Paracouſſy Vtina, which after he had feaſted them according to his abilitie and power, prayed monſieur De Arlac and all his ſoldiers to ſtay a whyle with him, to ayde and aſſiſt him in battayle againſt one of his enimies calledKing Patanou

Eight or tenne dayes after I ſent Captayne Vaſſeur backe againe with a barke to fetch home monſur De Arlac and his ſoldiers, which at their returne brought me certaine preſents from Vtina, as ſome ſyluer, a ſmale quantitie of golde, painted ſkins,Siluer, & gold, and paynted skins. and other thinges, with a thouſande thankes, which the Paracouſſy gaue me, which promiſed that if in any enterpriſe of importance I ſhoulde haue neede of his men, he would furniſh meé with threé hundred & aboue. While I thus trauailed to purchaſe friendes and to practiſe one while with one here, an otherwhile with an other there, certayne ſoldiers of my companie were ſuborned vnder hand by one named la Roquette of the countrie ofLa Roquettes conſpiracie.

Furthermore that their manner of proceéding ſeémed ſtrange vnto me, for that they imagined, that the Kinges Maieſtie was at the charges of our voyage for none other ende but to enrich them at their firſt arriuall, in as much as they ſhewed themſelues much more giuen vnto couetouſneſſe the

               Bourdet determined to leaue me to returne into Fraunce.

Threé dayes after his departure thirteene mariners which I had brought out of France, ſuborned by certayne other mariners which captaine Bourdet had left me, ſtole away my barkes in manner following.

And that which was woorſe, two Flemmiſhe carpenters, whiche the ſayde Bourdet had left me, ſtole away the other barke, and before their departure cut the cables of the barke and of the ſhippe Boate, that it might goe away with the tyde, that I might not purſue them: ſo that I remayned without either barke or boate, which fell out as vnluckily for me as was poſſible. For I was readye to imbarke my ſelfe with all ſpeéde, to diſcouer as farre vp our riuer, as I might by any meanes. Nowe my mariners, as I vnderſtoode afterwardes, tooke a barke that was a paſſenger of the Spaniardes neére the Iſle of Cuba, wherein they founde a certayne quantitie of golde and ſiluer, which they ſeaſed vppon: And hauing this bootie they lay a while at ſea, vntill their victuals beganne to ſayle them: whiche was the cauſe that oppreſſed with famine

When I ſawe my Barkes returned not at their wonted howre, and ſuſpecting that which fell out in deéde, I commaunded my Carpenters with all diligence to make a little boate with a flat bottome, to ſerch thoſe riuers for ſome newes of theſe Marriners. The boate diſpatched within a day and a night, by reaſon that my Carpenters found planks and timber readie ſawed to their handes, as commonly I cauſedA ſavve mill neceſſary here my Sawyers to prouide it, I ſent men to ſeéke ſome newes of my thieues: but all was in vaine. Therefore I determined to cauſe two great Barkes to be built, each of which might bee thirtie fiue or thirtie ſixe foote long in the keele. And nowe the worke was verie well forward which I ſet my workemen about, when ambition & auarice, the mother of all miſchiefe, tooke roote in the heartes of foure or fiue ſoldiers which could not away with the worke and paines taking: and which from hence forward, namely one Foueneaux, and one La Croix, and another calledThe thirde ſedition. 
               Steuen le Geneuois, the threé principall authors of the ſedition, beganne to practiſe with the beſt of my troupe, ſhewing them that it was a vile thing for men of honeſt parentage, as they were, to moyle them ſelues thus wich abiect and baſe worke, ſeeing they had the beſt occaſion of the worlde offered them to make themſelues all rich: which was to arme the two Barkes which were in building and to furniſh them with good men: and then to ſaile vnto Peru, and the other Iſles of the Antilles, where euerieBy Peru the French meane the coſte of Carthagena and Nombre de Dios. ſoldier might eaſily enrich himſelfe with ten thouſand crownes. And if their enterpriſe ſhoulde bee miſliked with all in France, they ſhoulde bee alwayes able, by reaſon of the great wealth that they ſhould gaine, to returne themſelues into Italie, vntill the heate were ouer paſſed, and that in the meane ſeaſon ſome warre would fall out which would cauſe all this to bee quite forgotten. This worde of riches ſounded ſo well in the eares of my ſoldiers, that in fine, after they had oftentimes conſulted of their affaires, they grew to the number of threé ſcore and fixe: which to colour their great deſire which they had to goe on ſtealing, they cauſed a requeſt to be preſented vnto mee by Francis la Caille ſergeant of my companie, containing in ſumme a declaration of the ſmale

ſtore of victuals that was left to mayntayne vs, vntill the time that ſhippes might returne from France: for remedie whereof they thought it neceſſarie to ſende to Newe Spaigne, to Peru, and all the Iles adioyning, which they beſought meé to bee content to grant. But I made them anſwere▪ that when the barkes were finiſhed, I woulde take ſuch good order in generall, that by meanes of the kinges Marchandiſe, without ſparing myne owne apparell, weé woulde get victuals of the inhabitantes of the countrey: ſeéing alſo that wee had ynough to ſerue vs for foure monethes to come. For I feared greatly, that vnder pretence of ſerching victuals they woulde enterpriſe ſomewhat againſt the kings of Spaynes ſubiectes, which in time to come might iuſtly be layde to my charge, conſidering that at our departureThe captaines charge at his ſetting forth. out of France, the Queéne had charged me very expreſly, to do no kinde of wrong to the king of Spaines ſubiects, nor any thing whereof he might conteyne any ieloſie. They made as though they were content with this anſwere. But eight daies after, as I continued in working vpon our fort, & on my barkes, I fell ſicke. Then my ſeditious companions forgetting all honour and duetie, ſuppoſing that they had found good occaſion to execute their rebellious enterpriſe, began to practiſe afreſh their former deſignes, handling their buſines ſo well, during my ſicknes, that they openly vowed that they woulde ſeaſe of the corps de gard, and of the

My lieuetenant being hereof aduertiſed, came and tolde me that he ſuſpected ſome euill practiſe: and the next day in the morninge I was ſaluted at my gate with men in complet harnes, what time my ſoldiers were about to plaie me a ſhrewde tricke: then I ſent to ſeeke a couple of gentlemen, whome I moſt truſted, which brought me word that the ſoldiers were determined to come to mee to make a requeſt vnto me: But I told them that this was not the faſhiō to preſent a requeſt vnto a captaine in this maner, & therefore they ſhould ſend ſome fewe vnto mee to ſignifie vnto me what they woulde haue.

But in ſtéede of writing vnto his wife, he ſpake vnto the boyes ſecretly that with all diligence ſhe ſhould ſend the veſſels that were in the hauens néere that place to ſuecour and reſcue him.

Their ſaile was no ſooner deſcried vpon our coaſt, but the king ofKing Patica. the place named Patica, dwelling eight leagues diſtant from our fort, and being one of our good friends, ſent an Indian to aduertiſe me that he had deſcried a ſhippe vpon the coaſt, and that hee thought it was one of our Nation. Herevppon the Brigantine oppreſſed with famine came to an ancre at the mouth of the riuer of May: when at the firſt bluſh wee thought they had beene ſhippes come from France: which gaue vs occaſion of great ioy. But after I had cauſed her to bee better viewed, I was aduertiſedThe returne of part of Laudonieres ſeditious ſoldiers. that they were our ſeditious companious that were returned. Therefore I ſent them word by Captaine Vaſſeur and my Sergeant, that they ſhould bring vp their Brigantine before the fortreſſe, which they promiſed to doe. Now there was not aboue two leagues diſtance from the mouth of the riuer where they caſt ancre vnto the fortreſſe. The next daie I ſent the ſame Captaine and Sergeant with thirtie ſouldiours, becauſe I ſaw they much delaied their comming. Then they brought them, and becauſe certaine of them had ſworne at their departure, that they would neuer come againe within the fort, I was wel pleaſed they ſhould kéepe their oath. For this purpoſe I waited for them at the riuers mouth, where I made my barkes to be built, and commanded my Sergeant to bring the foure chiefe authours of the mutinie on ſhore. Whom I cauſed unmediately to be put in fetters: for my meaning was not to puniſh the reſt, conſidering that they were ſuborned, and becauſe my counſell, expreſſely aſſembled for this purpoſe, had concluded that theſe foure onely ſhoulde die,Laudonnieres oration to his mutinous ſoldiers. to ſerue for an example to the reſt. In the ſame place I made an Oration vnto them in this maner. My friendes, you knowe
               
               the cauſe why our king ſent vnto this countrie: you knowe that hee is our naturall Prince, whome wee are bounde to obey according to the commandement of God, in ſuch ſorte that wee ought neither to ſpare our goods nor liues to doe thoſe thinges, that concerne his ſeruice: yee knowe, or at leaſt you can not be ignorant, that beſides this generall and naturall obligation, you haue this alſo ioyned thereunto, that in receyuing of him reaſonable paye and wages, you are bounde to followe thoſe, whome hee hath eſtabliſhed ouer you, to bee your gouernors, and to commaunde you in his name, hauing for this purpoſe giuen him an othe of fidelitie, which you cannot by any meanes reuoke for any faire apparence which you haue to doe the contrarie: for this is reaſon that ſeeing you liue vppon his charges on this condition, (this is reaſon I ſaye,) that you ſhoulde bee faithfull vnto him. Notwithſtanding you haue had more regarde vnto your vnbridled affections, then vnto vertue, which inuited you to the obſeruance of your othe, in ſuch ſort that being become contemners of all honeſtie, you haue paſſed your bonds, and thought that all things were lawful for you. Whereupon it is fallen out, that while you thought to eſcape the iuſtice of men you coulde not auoide the iudgement of God: which as a thing by no meanes to bee auoided hath ledde you, and in ſpite of you hath made you to arriue in this place, to make you to confeſſe, how true his iudgementes are, and that he neuer ſuffreth ſo foule a fault to eſcape vnpuniſhed. After that I had vſed vnto thē theſe or the like ſpeaches, following that which wee had agreed vppon in counſaile, in reſpect of the crimes which they had committed, aſwell againſt the kinges Maieſtie, as againſt mée which was their Captaine, I commaunded that they ſhoulde bee hanged. Seeing thereforeThe ſentence of death. that there was no ſtarting hole nor meanes at all to ſaue themſelues from this arreſt, they tooke themſelues vnto their praiers. Yet one of the foure thinking to rayſe a mutinie among my ſoldiers, ſayd thus vnto them: What, brethren & companions, will you ſuffer vs to die ſo ſhamefully? And taking the word out of his mouth, I ſaid vnto him, that they were not companiōs of authors of ſedition & rebels vnto the kings ſeruice. Hereupon the ſoldiers

beſought me not to hang thē, but rather let them be ſhot through▪ and then afterward if I thought good, their bodies might beExecution. hanged vpon certaine gibbets along the Hauens mouth: which I cauſed preſently to bee put in execution. Loe heere what was the and of my mutinous ſoldiers, without which I had alwaies liued peaceably and enioyed the good deſire which I had to make an happie and quiet voyage. But becauſe I haue ſpoken of nothing but their accidentes and aduentures which happened vnto them after their departure, without making any mention of our fort,The continuation of the hiſtorie. I will returne to the matters from which I digreſſed: to declare that which fell out after their departure. Firſt I began to conſider, to the ende I might confirme and make my ſelfe more conſtant in mine affliction, that theſe murmurours coulde not ground their ſedition vpon want of victualls. For from the time of our arriuall, euery ſoldier daily vnto this day and beſides vntil the eight and twentith of February had a loaf of bread weighing two and twenty ounces. Againe I recounted with my ſelfe that all newe conqueſts by ſea or by land are ordinarily troubledNevve conqueſts ſubiect to rebellions and mutinies. with rebellions, which are eaſie to be raiſed aſwel in reſpect of the diſtance of place, as in reſpect of the hope that the ſouldiers haue to make their profite, as we may bee well informed both by auncient hiſtories, & alſo by the troubles which lately happened vnto Chriſtopher Columbus, after his firſt diſcouery, to Francis Pizarro, & Diego de Almagro in Peru, and to Fernand Cortes. An hundred thouſand other thinges came vnto my minde, to incourage and confirme me. My Lieuetenaunt Ottigny and my Sergeaurunt of my band came to ſeeke me in the ſhippe, where I was priſoner, and carried me from thence in a barke, aſſoone as our rebels were departed. After I was come vnto the fort, ILaudonniere ſetteth things in order after his returne out of priſon to the fort. cauſed all my companye that remained to bee aſſembled in the middeſt of the place before the corps de garde, and declared vnto them the faultes which they which had forſaken vs had committed, praying them to beare them in memorie, to beare witneſſe thereof when neede ſhoulde require. Forthwith I ordained newe Captaines to commaund the troupes, and preſcribed them an order, according where-vnto they were to gouerne themſelues from thence forwarde, and to enter into their watch, for the greateſt parte of the ſouldyers

of whome I had the beſt opinion, were gone away with them. My declaration ended, they promiſed me all with one accorde to obey me moſt humblie, and to doe whatſoeuer I ſhoulde commaunde them, though it were to die at my féete for the kinges ſeruice: wherein aſſuredly they neuer after fayled: So that I dare ſay after the departure of my mutinous companions I was as well obeyed as euer was Captayne in place where hee commaunded. The next day after my returne vnto the fort, I aſſembled my men together agayne, to declare vnto them that our fort was not yet finiſhed, and that it was néedefull that all of vs ſhoulde put thereto our helping handes, to aſſure our ſelues againſt the Indians. Wherein hauing willingly agréed vnto me,Reperation of the vveſt ſide of the fort. Carpenters. they raiſed it all with turfes from the gate vnto the riuer, which is on the weſt ſide. This done I ſet my Carpenters on worke to make another barke of the ſame bigneſſe that the others were of: I commanded the ſawiers that they ſhould prepare plancks,Savviers. Smithes. Coleyers. the Smithes to prepare yron and Nayles, and certayne others to make coales: ſo that the barke was finiſhed in eightéene dayes. Afterwarde I made an other leſſer then the firſt the better to diſcouer vp the riuer. In this meane ſpace the Indians viſited me and brought me daily certaine preſents, as fiſh, deare, Turkicockes, Leopards, little Beares, and other things according to the place of their habitation. I recompenſed them with certayne hatchets, kniues, beads of glaſſe, combes, and looking-glaſſes. Two Indians came vnto me one day to ſalute me on theKing Marracou. behalfe of their king whoſe name was Marracou, dwelling from the place of our fort ſome fortie leagues toward the South, and tolde me that there was one in the houſe of King Onathaqua which was called Barbu or the bearded man, and in the houſe ofKing Onathaqua. King Mathiaca. king Mathiaca another man whoſe name they knew not, which was not of their nation: wherupon I conceiued that theſe might be ſome Chriſtians. Wherefore I ſent to all the kinges my neighbours to pray them, that if there were any Chriſtian dwelling in their countries, they would finde meanes that hee might be brought vnto me, and that I woulde make them double recompence. They, which loue rewardes, tooke ſomuch payne, that the two men, whereof wee haue ſpoken, were brought vnto the fort vnto mee. They were naked, wearing their heires

long vnto their hammes as the ſauages vſe to doe: and wereTvvo Spaniards brought vnto Laudonniere by the ſauages. Spaniards borne, yet ſo well accuſtomed to the faſhion of the countrie, that at the firſt ſight they found our manner of apparell ſtraunge. After that I had queſtioned of certayne matters with thē, I cauſed them to be apparelled and to cut their heire, which they would not looſe, but lapped it vp in a lynen cloth, ſaying that they woulde carie it into their countrey to be a teſtimonie of the miſerie that they had indured in the Indies. In the heire of one of them was founde a little golde hidden, to the value of fiue and twentie Crownes, which hée gaue vnto me. And examining them of the places, where they had beene, and howe they came thither, they anſwered mee that fiftéene yeares paſt, thrée ſhippes, in one of which they were, were caſt away ouer againſtCalos a place The Flattes called the Martyrs neere the Cape of Florida. a place named Calos vppon the Flates which are called The Martyrs, and that the king of Calos recouered the greateſt part of the riches which were in the ſaide ſhippes, traueiling in ſuch ſort that the greateſt part of the people was ſaued and many women, among which number there were thrée or foure women married, remaining there yet, and their children alſo, with this king of Calos. I deſired to learne what this king was:The King of Calos. they anſwered me, that he was the goodlieſt and the talleſt Indian of the countrey, a mightie man, a warrier, and hauing many ſubiectes vnder his obedience. They tolde me moreouer, that hee had great ſtore of golde and ſyluer, ſo farre foorth that in aGreat quantitie of gold & ſyluer. certayne village hée had a pit full thereof, which was at the leaſt as high as a man, and as large as a tunne, all which wealth the Spaniards fully perſwaded themſelues that they coulde cauſe me to recouer, if I were able to marche thither with an hundred ſhotte, beſides that which I might get of the common people of the countrie, which had alſo great ſtore thereof. They further alſo aduertiſed me, that the women going to daunce did we arePlates of gold as broad as a ſavvcer. about their girdles plates of golde as broade as a ſawcer, and in ſuch number that the weight did hinder them to dance at theyr eaſe, and that the men ware the like alſo. The greateſt part of theſe riches was had, as they ſayde, out of the Spaniſh 
                  ••
               ppes which commonly were caſt away in this ſtraight, and the reſt, by the traficke which this king of Calos had with the other kings

of the countrie, finallie that hée had in great reuerence of his ſubiectes, and that hee made them beléene, that his ſorceries and charmes were the cauſes that made the earth bring foorth her fruite, and that hee might the eaſier perſwade them that it was ſo, he retyred himſelfe once or twiſe a yeare to a certaine houſe, accompanied with two or thrée of his moſt familier friendes, where hee vſed certayne inchauntmentes, and if any man intruded himſelfe to goe to ſée what they did in this place, the king immediately cauſed him to bee put to death. Moreouer theyOne of theſe Spaniardes names was Martin Gomes. tolde mee, that euery yeare in the time of harueſt this ſauage king ſacrificed one man, which was kepte expreſſely for this purpoſe, and taken out of the number of the Spaniardes, which by tempeſt were caſt away vppon that coſte. One of theſe two declared vnto mee that hee had ſerued him a long time for a meſſenger: and that oftentimes by his commaundement hee had viſited a king named Oathcaqua, diſtant from Calos foureKing Oathcaqua or Houathcha. or fiue dayes iourney, which alwayes remayned his faithfull friende: but that in the midway there was an Ilande ſituate in a great lake of freſhwater, named Sarrope, about fiue leagues inSarrope an Ilande. Aboundance of Dates. A roote of great price to make bread of bigneſſe, abounding with many ſortes of fruites, ſpecially in Dates which growe on the palme trées, whereof they make a wonderfull traficke, yet not ſo great as a kinde of roote, whereof they make a kinde of meale ſo good to make bread of, that it is vnpoſſible to eate better: and that, for fifteene leagues about, all the countrie is fed therewith. Which is the cauſe that the inhabitantes of the Iſle gaine of their neighbours great wealth and profite: for they will not depart with this roote without they he well payed for it: beſides that they are taken for the moſt warrelike men of all that countrie, as they made good proofe when the king of Calos, hauing made alliance with Oathcaqua, was depriued of Oathcaquaes daughter which hee had promiſed to him in marriage. Hee tolde mee the whole matter in this ſorte. As Oathcaqua well accompanied with his people carried one of his daughters, excéeding beawtifull, according to the coulour of the countrey, vnto king Calos, to giue her vnto him for his wife, the inhabitantes of his Iſle aduertiſed of the matter, layde an ambuſh for him in a place where

hee ſhould paſſe, and ſo behaued themſelues, that Oathcaqua was diſcomfited, the betrothed young ſpouſe taken, and all the Damoſelles that accompanied her, which they carried vnto theirThe greateſt victorie among the Floridians. Iſle, which thing in all the Indians countrey they eſteeme to be the greateſt victorie: for afterwarde they marrie theſe virgins, and loue them aboue all meaſure. The Spaniarde that made this relation, tolde me that after this defeite he went to dwell with Oathcaqua, and had béene with him full eight yeares, euen vntil the time that hee was ſent vnto mee. The place ofThe ſituation of Calos. 
               Calos is ſituate vppon a riuer which is beyond the Cape of Florida fortie or fiftie leagues towardes the Southweſt: and the dwelling of Oathcaqua is on this ſide the Cape towarde the North in a place which we call in the Carte Caignaueral, whichCaiguaueral in 28. degrees. is in eight and twentie degrées. About the fiue and twenteth of Ianuarie Paracouſſy Satourioüa my neighbour ſent me certayne preſentes by two of his ſubiectes, to perſwade me to ioyne with him, and to make warre vppon Ouae Vtina which was my friende: and farther beſought mee to retyre certayne of my men which were with Vtina, for whome if it had not béene hee had oftentimes ſet vppon him and defeited him, he beſought me herein by diuers other kinges his allies, which for thrée weekes or a monethes ſpace ſent meſſengers vnto mee to this ende and purpoſe. But I woulde not graunt vnto them that they ſhould make warre vppon him, yea rather contrariwiſe I endeuoured to make them friendes: wherein they condiſcended vnto mee, ſo farre foorth that they were content to allowe of any thing that I would ſet downe: whereupon the two Spaniardes which of long time knew well the nature of the Indians, warned me that in any caſe I ſhould not truſt vnto them: becauſe that when theyThe Floridians great traitors and diſemblers. ſhewed good countenance and the beſt chéere vnto men, then was the time that they woulde ſurpriſe and betraye them: and that of their nature they were the greateſt traitours and moſt deepe diſſemblers of the worlde. Beſides I neuer truſted them but vpon good ground, as one that had diſcouered a thouſand of their craftes and ſubtilties, aſwel by experience as by reading of the hiſtories of late yeares. Our two barkes were not ſo ſoone finiſhed, but I ſent Captayne Vaſſeur to diſconer a long the coſte lying towarde the Northe, and commaunded him to

ſaile vnto a riuer the king wherof was called Auduſta, which was lord of that place, where thoſe of the yeare 1562. inhabites. I ſent him twoe ſutes of apparel, with certaine hachats, kniues, and other ſmale trifles, the better to inſinuate my ſelfe into his friendſhippe. And the better to win him I ſent in the barke with captaine Vaſſeur a ſoldier called Aimon, which was one of them which returned home in the firſte voyage, hoping that king Auduſta might remember him. But before they were embarked I commanded them to make inquirie what was become of another called Rouffi, which remained alone in thoſe parts, when NicolasNicalas Maſſon. Maſſon and thoſe of the firſte voyage embarked themſelues to returne into France. They vnderſtood at their arriual there, that a barke paſſing that waye had caried awaye the ſame ſoldier: And afterward I knew for a certaintie, that they were Spaniardes which had carried him to Hauana. The kinge Auduſta ſent mee backe my barke ful of mill, with a certaine quantitie ofKing Auduſtas great humanitie. Perles burned beanes, twoe ſtages, ſome ſkins painted after theire maner, and certaine pearles of ſmall value, becauſe they were burnt: and ſent me worde that if I woulde dwel in his quarters, he woulde geue me a greate countrye: and that after hee had gathered his mil, he would ſpare me as much as I would haue. In the meane while there came vnto our forte a flocke of ſtocke voues in ſoPeter Martyr vvrites cap. 1. decad. 7. that the like flocks of Pigeons are in the Iſles of the Lucayes. greate nomber, and that for the ſpace of ſeuen weekes together, that euery daye wee killed with hargubuſe ſhot twoe hundred in the woods aboute our forte. After that captaine Vaſſeur was returned I cauſed the two barkes to be furniſhed againe with ſoldiers and mariners, and ſent them to carrie a preſent from mee vnto the widow of king Hioacaia, whoſe dwelling was diſtanteThe vvidovve of King Hioacaia, or Hihouhacara. from our forte about twelue leages northward. Shee curteouſly receaued our men, ſent me backe my barks full of mil and acorns with certaine baſkets full of the leaues of Caſſine, where with they make their drinke. And the place where this widowe dwelleth is the moſt plentiful of mil that is in all the coaſte and theThis Quenes name vvas Nia-Cubacani. moſte pleaſant. It is thought that the queene is the moſt beautiful of al the Indians, and of whome they make moſt accompt: yea and her ſubiects honour her ſo much, that almoſt continualy they beare her on their ſhoulders and wil not ſuffer her to go on foote. With in a few daies after the return of my barks, ſhe ſent to viſit me

by her Hiatiqui, which is as much to ſaye as her interpreter. Nowe while I thought I was furniſhed with victuals vntill the time that our ſhippes might come out of France, (for feare ofThe fift voiage vp the riuer of May. keeping my people idle) I ſent my two barkes to diſcouer along the riuer and vp toward the head thereof, which went ſo farre vp that they were thirtie leagues good beyonde a place named Mathiaqua,
               Mathiaqua. The diſcouerie of a mighty lake on the one ſid vvherof no land can be ſeene. and there they diſcouered the entrance of a lake vpō the oneſide whereof no land can bee ſeene, according to the reporte of the Indians, which had oftentimes climed on the hieſt trees in the country to ſee land, and notwithſtanding could not diſcerne any: which was the cauſe that my men went no further, but returned backe, and in comminge home went to ſee the Ilande ofThe Iſle of Edelano. 
               Edelano ſituated in the midſt of the riuer, as faire a place as any that may be ſeene through the world. For in the ſpace of ſome three leagues, that it may containe in length and breadth, a man maye ſee an exceeding riche countrie and marueilou fly peopled. At the comming out of the village of Edelano to go vnto the riuers ſide a man muſt paſſe through an allie aboute three hundred paſes long and fiftie paces broade: on both ſides whereof greate trees are planted, the boughes whereof are tied together like anAn excellent vvorke of nature. arche, and meete together ſo artificiallye that a man woulde thinke it were an arboure made of purpoſe, as faire I ſaye, as any in all chriſtendome, although it be altogether naturall. OurEneguape, Chilily, Patica, Coya. men departing from this place rowed to Eneguape, then to Chilily, from thence to Patica, & laſtly they came vnto Coya: where leuing their barks in a little creeke of the riuer with men to gard them, they went to viſit Vtina, which receaued them very courteouſly: and when they departed from his houſe, hee entreated them ſo earneſtly, that ſixe of my men remained with him, of which nūber there was one gentleman named Groutauld, which after he had aboade there aboute two monethes and taken great paines to diſcouer the countrie, with another which I had left a great while there to that intent, came vnto mee to the fort, andThe king of Hoſtaqua or Ouſtaca able to bring three or foure thouſand ſauages, to the field. tolde mee that he neuer ſawe a fairer countrie. Amonge other thinges he reported vnto me that he had ſene a place named Hoſtaqua, & that the king thereof was ſo mightie, that he was able to bring three or foure thouſand ſauages to the field: with whom if I would ioine & enter in to league, we might be able to reduce

all the reſt of the inhabitants vnto our obedience: Beſides thatThe moūtaine of Apalaſſy. this king knewe the paſſages vnto the mountaine of Apalaſſi, which the French men deſired ſo greatly to attaine vnto, and where the enimie of Hoſtaqua made his abode, which was eaſie to be ſubdued, if ſo be wee woulde enter into league together. This king ſent me a plate of a mynerall that came out of this mountayne, out of the foote whereof there runneth a ſtreame of golde or copper, as the ſauages thinke, out of which they diggeThere is a Mine of golde or rich copper in the mountaine of Apalaſſi. vp the ſande with an holow and drie cane of a reéde vntill the cane be full, afterwarde they ſhake it, and finde that there are manie ſmall graines of copper and ſyluer among this ſande: which giueth them to vnderſtande that ſome rich myne muſt neéds be in the Mountaine. And becauſe the mountaine was not paſt fiue or ſixe dayes iourney from our fort lying toward the northweſt, INote. determined, aſſone as our ſupplie ſhould come out of France, to remoue our habitation vnto ſome riuers more toward the north, that I might be neérer therunto. One of my ſoldiers whoſe namePeter Gamby ſlaine. The village of Edelano. Golde and ſyluer. was Peter Gamby, which had remained a long ſpace before in this countrie to learne the languages and trafficke with the Indians, at the laſt came to the village of Edelano, where hauing gotten together a certaine quantitie of gold and ſyluer, & purpoſing to returne vnto me, he prayed the king of the village to lend him a Canoa (which is a veſſell made of one whole piece of wood which the Indians vſe to fiſh with al and to row vpon the riuers) which this lorde of Edelano graunted him. But being greédy of the riches which he had, he commanded two Indians, which heé had charged to conduct him in the Canoa, to murder him & bring him the marchandiſe & the gold which he had. Which y• two traitors villanouſly executed: for they knockt him in the head with an hatchet, as he was blowing of the fire in the Canoa to ſeéth fiſhe. The Paracouſſy Vtina ſent certayne dayes afterward, to prayVtinaſendeth to I audonniere for his helpe. me to lende him a doſen or fifteéne of my ſhot, to enuade his enimie Potanou, & ſent me word that this enimie once vanquiſhed, he would make me paſſage, yea and would conduct mee vnto the mountains, in ſuch ſort that no man ſhould be able to hinder me. Then I aſſembled my men to demaunde theyr aduice, as I was wont to doe in all mine enterpriſes. The greater part was ofA good note. opinion, that I ſhoulde doe well to ſende ſuccour vnto this Paracouſſy,
               
becauſe it would be harde for mee to diſcouer any farther vp into the countrie without his helpe: and that the SpaniardsA ſpecial note when they were employed in their conqueſtes, did alwaies enter into alliance with ſome one king to ruine another. Notwithſtanding, becauſe I did alwayes miſtruſt the Indians, and that the more after the laſt aduertiſement that the Spaniards had giuen me, I doubted leaſt the ſmall number which Vtina demaunded might incurre ſome danger: wherefore I ſent him thirtie ſhot vnder the charge of Lieuetenant Ottigny: which ſtayed not aboue two dayes with Vtina, while he prepared victuals for his voyage, which ordinarily and according to the cuſtome of the countrie are carried by women and yong boyes, and by Hermaphrodites. Vtina ſetting forward with threé hundred of his ſubiectes,Thre hundred Indians. hauing ech of them their bowe and quiuer full of arrowes, cauſed our thirtie ſhot to be placed in the forewarde, and made them march all the day vntill that the night approching, and hauing not gone paſt halfe the way, they were enforced to lie alnight in the woodes, neére a great ſake, and there to encampe themſelues: they ſeperated themſelues by ſixe and ſixe, making ech of them a fire about the place where their king lay, for whoſe garde they ordayned a certayne number of thoſe archars, in whome hee put moſt confidence. As ſoone as daye was come, the campe of the Indians marched within threé leagues of Potanou: There king Vtina requeſted my Lieutenant to graunt him foure or fiue of his men to goe and diſcouer the countrey: which departed immediately, and had not gone farre but they perceyuedA lake three leages diſtant from the village of Potanou. vpon a lake, diſtant about threé leagues from the village of Potanou, three Indians which fiſhed in a Canoa. Nowe the cuſtome is that when they fiſhe in this lake, they haue alwayes a companie of Watchmen, armed with Bowes and Arrowes to garde the fiſhers. Our men being hereof aduertiſed by thoſe of the companie, durſt not paſſe any further, for feare of falling into ſome ambuſhe. Wherefore they returned towardes Vtina, which ſuddenly ſent them backe with a greater company to ſurpriſe the fiſhers, before they might retyre and aduertiſe their king Potanou of the comming of his enimies. Which they coulde not execute ſo politikely but that two of them eſcaped:

the third alſo did the beſt he could to ſaue himſelfe by ſwimming, in which meane while hee was ſtaied with ſhotte of arrowes, and they drew him ſtarke dead vnto the bankes ſide, where our Indians fleade of the ſkinne of his head, cut of both his armes in the high way, reſeruing his haire for the triumphe which their king hoped to make for the defeate of his enimie. Vtina fearing leaſt Potanou aduertiſed by the Fiſhers which were eſcaped, ſhoulde put himſelfe in armes to withſtand him valiantly, asked counſellIávva, ſignifieth their Prieſt or magician. of his Iawa, which is aſmuch to ſay in their language as his Magician, whether it were beſt to goe any farther. Then this Magician made certaine ſignes hidious and fearefull to beholde, and vſed certaine wordes, which being ended, he ſayd vnto his king,Potanou accompanied vvith tvvo thouſand Indians. that it was not beſt to paſſe any farther, & that Potanou accompanied with two thouſand Indians at the leaſt ſtaied in ſuch and ſuch a place for him, to byd him battaile: and beſides this, that all the ſayd Indians were furniſhed with coards to binde the priſoners which they made full accompt to take. This relation cauſed Vtina to be vnwilling to paſſe any farther: Whereupon my Lieuetenant being as angry as euer he might be, becauſe he had taken ſo great paines without doing any thing of accompt, ſayd vnto him, that he would neuer thinke well of him nor of his people, if he would not hazard himſelfe: and that if he would not doe it, at the leaſt that he would giue him a guide to conduct him and his ſmall companye to the place where the enimies were encamped. Hereupon Vtina was aſhamed, and ſeeing the good affectionThe prediction of the magician found true. on of Mountieur de Ottigny determined to goe forward. And he failed not to find his enimies in the very place which the Magician had named: where the ſkirmiſh began, which laſted three long houres: wherein without doubt Vtina had beene defeated, vnleſſe our harquebuſiers had not borne the burthen & brunt of all the battaile, and ſlaine a great number of the ſouldiers of Potanou, vpon which occaſion they were put to flight. Wherewithall Vtina being content for the preſent, cauſed his people to retire & returne homewarde to the great diſcontentment of Mounſieur de Ottigny, which deſired nothing more, then to purſue his victorie.

Then the kinges my neighbours all enemies to Vtina, being aduertiſed of the returne of my Lieuetenaunt, came to viſite me with preſents and to enquire how things had paſſed, praying mee all to receiue them into my fauour, and to become enimy to Vtina, which notwithſtanding I would not graunt them for many reaſons that moued mee.

For when they goe on hunting, they make little cottages in the woodes, whereunto they retire themſelues, liuing vpon that which they take in hunting. This was the cauſe that during this time, we could get no victuals by their meanes: and had it not beene that I had made good prouiſionThey looke for ſuccour out of France by the end of April at the vttermoſt. thereof, while my men had ſtore, vntill the ende of Aprill (which was the time, when at the vttermoſt, we hoped to haue had ſuccour out of France) I ſhould haue beene greatly amazed. This hope was the cauſe that the ſouldiers tooke no great care to look well vnto their victuals, although I deuided equally among thē that which I could get abroad in the countrey, without reſeruing vnto my ſelfe any more then the leaſt ſouldyer of all the company. The moneth of May approching and no manner of ſuccour commen out of France, we fell into extreame want of victuals, conſtrained to eate the rootes of the earth and certaine ſorrell which we found in the fieldes. For although the ſauages were retourned by this time vnto their villages, yet they ſuccoured vs with nothing but certaine fiſh, without which aſſuredly wee had periſhed with famine.

                famine held vs from the beginning of May, vntill the middeſt of

Iune. During which time the poore ſouldyers and handycrafteſmen become as féeble as might be, and beeing not able to worke, did nothing but goe one after another in centinel vnto the clift of an hill, ſcituate very néere vnto the fort, to ſée if they might diſcouer any French ſhippe. In fine beeing fruſtrated of their hope, they aſſembled altogether, and came to beſéech me to take ſome order that they might returne into France, conſidering that if we let paſſe the ſeaſon to embarke our ſelues, we were neuer like to ſée our countrie, where it coulde not bee choſen but that ſome troubles were fallen out, ſéeing they had broken their promiſePromiſe broken. made vnto vs, and that no ſuccour was come from thence. Thervpon it was conſulted and reſolued by all the companye that the barke Breton ſhould be trimmed vp, whereof Captaine Vaſſeur had charge. But becauſe the ſhippe was not bigge inough to receaue vs all, ſome thought good to builde the Brigantine two deckes higher, which our mutinous ſoldyers had brought backe, and that 25. men ſhould hazard themſelues to paſſe therein into France. The reſt being better aduiſed ſaid that it ſhoulde be farre better to builde a faire ſhippe vpon the kéele of the galiote which I had cauſed to be made, promiſing to labour couragiouſly there vpon. Then I enquired of my ſhipwrights to know in what ſpace they coulde make this ſhippe readie. They aſſured the whole company that being furniſhed with all things neceſſarie, they would make it ready by the eighth of Auguſt. Immediately I diſpoſed of the time to w

               rke vppon it, I gaue charge to Mounſieur de Ottigny my Lieuetenant to cauſe tymber neceſſarye for the finiſhing of both the veſſels to bee brought, and to Mounſieur de Arlac my ſtandart bearer to goe with a barke a league of from the fort to cut downe trees fit to make planckes, and to cauſe the ſawiers which he carried with him to ſaw them: and to my Sergeaunt of the companye to cauſe fiftéene or ſixtéene men to labour in making coales: and to Maſter Hance keeper of the artillery, and to the gunner to gather ſtore of roſen to braye the veſſels: wherein he vſed ſuch diligence, that in leſſe then threeTwo hogsheads of roſen wéekes he gathered two hogsheads of the ſame together. There remained now but the principal, which was to recouer victuals to ſuſtaine vs while our worke endured: which I vndertooke to do with the reſt of my company and the Mariners of the ſhippe. To this end I embarked my ſelfe making vp y• thirtieth in my great

barke to make a voyage of fortie or fiftie leagues, hauing with vs no prouiſion at all of victuals: whereby it may eaſily be gathered howe ſimply thoſe of our fort were prouided. True it is that certaine ſouldyers being better huſbandes then the reſt, and hauing made ſome prouiſion of maſt, ſolde a little meaſure thereof for fiftéene and twenty ſous vnto their companions. During our voyage we liued of nothing elſe but raſpices, of a certaine round graine, little and blacke, and of the rootes of palmites which we gate by the riuer ſides, wherein after wee had ſayled a long time in vaine, I was conſtrained to returne to the fort: where the ſoldyers beginning to bee wearie of working becauſe of the extreame famine which did conſume them, aſſembled themſelues, & declared vnto me, that ſéeing we could get no victuals of the Indians, it was expedient for the ſauing of their liues, to ſeaſe vpon the perſon of one of the kinges of the countrie: aſſuring themſelues that being taken, the ſubiects woulde not ſuffer our men to want victuals. I made them aunſwere that this enterpriſe was not raſhly to be attempted. But that wee ought to haue good regarde vnto the conſequence that might inſue thereof. Hereupon they replyed vnto me, that ſéeing the time was paſt of our ſuccour from France, and that we were reſolued to abandon the countrie, that there was no danger to conſtraine the ſauages to furniſh vs with victuals: which for the preſent I would not graunt vnto thē but promiſed them aſſuredly that I would ſend to aduertiſe y• Indians that they ſhoulde bring me victuals for exchaunge of marchandiſe and apparel: which they alſo did for the ſpace of certain daies, during which they brought of their maſt and of their fiſh,The vile nature of the Indians. which theſe Indians being trayterous, & miſchieuous of nature, & knowing our excéeding ſtrange famin, ſold vs at ſo déere a price that for leſſe then nothing they had gotten frō vs all the reſt of our marchandiſe which remained. And which was worſe, fearing to be forced by vs & ſéeing that they had gottē al from vs, they came no nearer to our fort then the ſhot of an Harquebuſe. Thither they brought their fiſh in their little boats, to which our poore ſoldiers were conſtrained to go, & oftentimes (as I haue ſéen) to giue away the very ſhirtes from their backes to get one fiſh. If at any time they ſhewed vnto the ſauages the exceſſiue price which they tooke,A cruell anſvvere of the ſauages. theſe villains would anſwer thē rughly & churliſhly: if thou make ſo great account of thy marchandiſe, eat it, & we wil eat our fiſh:

then fell they out a laughing and mocked vs with open throate. Whereupon our ſouldyers vtterly impatient, were oftentimes ready to cutte them in pieces, and to make them pay the price of their fooliſh arrogancie. Notwithſtāding conſidering the importance hereof, I tooke paines to appeaſe the impatient ſouldier: for I would not by any meanes enter into queſtion with the ſauages, and it ſufficed mee to delay the time. Wherefore I deuiſed to ſende vnto Vtina to praye him to deale ſo farre forth with his ſubiects, as to ſuccour me with maſt and maiz: which he did very ſparingly, ſending me twelue or fifteéne baſkets of maſt, andPinocke a certaine kinde of fruite as big as cheries. two of pinockes, which are a kinde of little greéne fruites which growe among the weédes in the riuer, and are as big as cheries: yea & this was not but by giuing of them in exchaunge twiſe as much marchandiſe and apparell as they were worth. For the ſubiectes of Vtina perceiued euidently the neceſſitie wherein wee were, and began to vſe the like ſpeach vnto vs as the others did: as it is commonly ſeéne that neede altereth mens affections. While theſe thinges were in dooing a certaine breathing ſpace preſented it ſelfe: for Vtina gaue me to vnderſtand that there was a king his ſubiect whoſe name was Aſtina, which he determinedAſtina a king. to take priſoner, and to chaſtiſe him for his diſobedience: that for this cauſe, if I would giue him aid with a certaine number of my ſouldiers, he woulde bring them to the village of Aſtina, where there was meanes to recouer maſt and maiz. In the meane ſeaſon he excuſed himſelf vnto me becauſe he had ſent me no more maiz, and ſent me word that the little ſtore that he had left, was ſcarcely ſufficient for his ſeede-corne. Nowe being ſomewhat relieued, as I thought, by the hope which I had of this offer, I would not fayle to ſend him the men which he deſired of me, which neuer the leſſe were very euill intreated: for he deceiued them, and in ſteéde of leading them againſt Aſtina, he cauſed them to march againſt his other enimies. My Lieuetenant which had the charge of this enterpriſe with Captaine Vaſſeur and my Sergeaunt was determined to be reuenged of Vtina and to cutte him in pieces and his people: and had it not beene that they feared to doe any thing againſt my will, without all doubt they would haue put their enterpriſe in execution. Therefore they would not paſſe any farther without aduertiſing me thereof. Wherefore being come backe agayne

vnto the fort, angry and pricked deépely to the quicke for being ſo mocked, they made their complaints vnto me, declaring vnto me that they were almoſt dead for hunger. They tolde the whole matter to the reſt of the ſouldyers, which were very glad that they had entred into that action, and reſolued, aſſembling themſelues agayne together, to let mee vnderſtand that they did perſiſt in their firſt deliberation, which was, to puniſh the boldnes and maliciouſues of the ſauages, which they could no longer endure, and were determined to take one of their kings priſoner: which thing I was enforced to graunt vnto them, to the ende to auoid a greater miſchiefe, & the ſedition which I foreſaw would enſue, if I had made refuſall thereof. For, ſayd they, what occaſion haue you to deny vs, conſidering the neceſſitie wherein we are, & the ſmall account that they make of vs. Shall it not be lawful for vs to puniſh them for the wrongs which they do vnto vs, beſides that we know apparantly how little they reſpect vs? Is not this ſufficient although there were no neceſſitie at all, ſince they thus delude vs, and haue broken promiſe with vs? After I had therefore reſolued with them to ſeaſe on the perſon of Vtina, which beſides that he had giuen vs occaſion hereof, was alſo moſt able to helpe vs to recouer victuals, I departed with fiftye of my beſt ſouldyers all embarked in two Barkes and wee▪ arriued in the dominions of Vtina, diſtant from our fort about fortye or fiftye leagues: then going on ſhoare wee drewe towardes his villageVtina taken priſoner in his village by Laudoniere and 50. of his ſouldyers. ſcituated ſixe great leagues from the riuer, where wee tooke him priſoner, how be it not without great cryes and alarmes, and led him away in our barkes, hauing firſt ſignyfied vnto hys Fatherin lawe and his chiefe ſubiectes, that in that I had taken hym, it was not for any deſire that I had to doe him any harme, but onely to relieue my neceſiitie and want of victuals which oppreſſed me, and that in caſe they woulde helpe me to ſome, I woulde finde meanes to ſet him agayne at libertie: that in the meane ſpace I woulde retire my ſelfe into my Barkes (for I feared leaſt they woulde there aſſemble themſelues together, and that ſome miſchief might thereof inſue) where I would ſtay for him two dayes, to receaue his aunſwere: notwithſtanding that my meaning was not to haue any thing without exchaunge of marchaundiſe. Thys they promiſed they woulde doe. And

in verye deéde the verye ſame euening, hys wyfe accompanyed withall the women of the village came vnto the Ryuers brincke, and cryed vnto meé to enter into the barke, to ſeé her huſband and her ſonne, which I helde both priſoners. I diſcouered theFiue or ſixe hundred Indians. next daye fiue or ſixe hundred Indyans Archers, which drewe neére vnto the Ryuers ſide, and came to meé to ſignyfie vnto meé howe that duryng the abſence of their kyng, their enemye Potanou beéyng thereof aduertiſed, was entred into their vyllage,The deepe diſſembling of the Indians. and had ſet al on fire. They prayed meé that I woulde ſuccour them: neuertheleſſe in the meane while they had one parte of their troupe in ambuſh, wyth intent to ſette vpon meé if I had come on lande, which was eaſie for meé to diſcerne. For ſeéyng that I refuſed ſo to doe, they greatly doubted that they were diſcouered, and ſought by all meanes, to remooue out of my mynde that euill opinion whych I had conceaued of them. They brought meé therefore fiſh in their little boates and of their meale of Maſt, they made alſo of their drinke which they call caſſine, which they ſent to Vtina and meé. Nowe albeit I had gotten thys poynt of them, that I helde their king pryſoner, yet neuertheleſſe I could not gette any greate quantitye of victuals for the preſent: the reaſon was, becauſe they thought, that after I had drawne victuals from them, I woulde put their Kynge to death. For they meaſured my will accordyng to their cuſtome,The Indians kil al the men priſoners that they take in warre. whereby they put to death all the men pryſoners that they take in Warre. And thus beéing out of all hope of hys libertye, they aſſembled themſelues in the great houſe, and hauing called all the people together they propoſed the election of a newe Kyng, at which time the Father in lawe of Vtina ſet one of the KyngesThe election of a new king. young Sonnes vpon the royal throne: and tooke ſuch paynes that euerye man dyd hym homage by the Maior parte of the voyces. This election had lyke to haue beéne the cauſe of great troubles amonge them. For there was a kinſman of a Kyng neére adioyning which pretended a tytle to the Kyngdome, and in deéde heé had gotten one parte of the Subiectes: notwithſtandyng thys enterpryſe coulde not take effecte, for aſmuch as by a common conſent of the chiefe, it was conſulted and concluded, that the Sonne was more meéte to ſucceéde the Father then anye other. Nowe all thys whyle I kepte Vtina with meé, to whome I had

giuen ſome of myne apparell to cloath hym, as I had lykewiſe done vnto hys Sonne. But his Subiectes which before had an opinion that I woulde haue killed hym, beeing aduertyſed of the good entertaynement which I vſed towardes him, ſent two men which walked alonge the Ryuer, and came to viſite hym, and brought vs ſome victuals. Theſe two men at their comming were receaued by me with all curteſie, and entertained according to the victuals which I had. Whyle theſe thinges thus paſſed there arriued from all quarters many ſauages of the countriesThe hatred among the ſauage kings of Florida. adioyning, which came to ſeé Vtina, and ſought by all meanes to perſwade me to put him to death, offering that if I would doe ſo, they woulde take order that I ſhoulde want no victuals. There was alſo a king my neighbour whoſe name was Saturioüa, a ſubtile and craftie man, and one that ſhewed by proofe that heéNote. was greatly practiſed in affaires. This king ſent ordinarily meſſengers vnto mee, to pray me to deliuer Vtina vnto him: and to win me the more eaſily, hee ſent twiſe ſeuen or eight baſkets of Maze or of maſt, thinking by this way to allure me, and to make me come to compoſition with him: In the ende notwithſtanding when he ſawe he loſt his time he ceaſed to viſite me with ambaſſages and victuals: and in the meane whyle I was not able with the ſmall ſtore of victuals which I had ſo well to proportion out the trauaile vppon the ſhippes which wee built to returne into France, but that in the ende wee were conſtrayned to endure extreame famine, which continued amonge vs all the moneth of Maye: for in this latter ſeaſon, neither Maiz nor Beanes,Note. nor Maſt was to beé founde in the villages, becauſe they had employed all for to ſowe their fieldes, inſomuch that weé were conſtrayned to eate rootes, which the moſt part of our men punned inRoots. the morters which I had brought with meé to beate gunnepowder in, and the grayne which came to vs from other places: ſome tooke the wood of Eſquine, beate it, and made meale thereof,Eſquine. which they boyled with water, and eate it: others went with their harquebuſies to ſeéke to kill ſome Foule. Yea this miſerie was ſo great, that one was founde that gathered vp amonge the filth of my houſe, all the Fiſh bones that heé coulde find, which heé dryed and beate into powder to make bread thereof. The effectes of this hidious famine appeared incontinently

among vs, for our bones eftſoones began to cleane ſo néere vnto the ſkinne, that the moſt part of the ſouldyers had their ſkinnes pearced thorough with them in manye partes of their bodyes: in ſuch ſorte that my greateſt feare was, leaſt the Indyans woulde ryſe vp agaynſt vs, conſidering that it would haue béene verye harde for vs to haue defended our ſelues in ſuch extreame decaye of all our forces, beſides the ſcarſitye of all victuals, which fayled vs all at once. For the verye Ryuer had not ſuch plenty of fiſh as it was wont, and it ſéemed that the lande and water dyd fight agaynſt vs. Now as we were thus vpon termes of diſpayre, about the ende of the moneth of Maye, and the beginningNevv corne by the ende of May in Florida. of Iune, I was aduertiſed by certayne Indyans that were my neighbours, that in the high countrie vp aboue the ryuer, there was newe maiz, and that that countrye was moſt forward of all. This cauſed me to take vpon me to goe thither with a certayne number of my men, and I went vp the ryuer to a place called Enecaque: where I met the ſiſter of Vtina in a villageThe village of Enecaque. where ſhee made vs verye good cheare and ſent vs fiſh. We found that which was tolde vs to bee true: for the maiz was now rype: but by this good lucke one ſhrewde turne happened vnto me. For the moſt part of my ſouldyers fell ſicke wyth eating more of it then their weakened ſtomackes coulde digeſt. We had alſo béene the ſpace of foure dayes, ſince wee departed from our fort, without eating anye thyng ſauyng little pinockes, and aA little green fruite that grovveth in the ryuers as bigge as cheries. The Iſle of Edelano. little fiſh, which wée gate of the Fyſhers, whych wée mette ſometymes along the ryner. And yet thys was ſo lyttle that certayne ſouldyers eate priuylye lyttle whelpes which were newly whelped. The next day I purpdſed to goe into the Iſle of Edelano to take the kyng which had cauſed one of my men to bée ſlayne, as I haue mentioned before: but béeyng aduertyſed of my departyng out of my Fort, and of the waye which I tooke vp the Ryuer, hée feared that I went foorth wyth a purpoſe to bée reuenged of the euil turne which hée had played: ſo that when I came thither, I founde the houſes emptye: for hée was retyred a lyttle before wythall hys people: and I could not by any meanes keep my ſoldiers, being angrie becauſe they had loſt one of their companions, from ſetting the village on fire. At my departure from thence I paſſed backe againe by Enecaque, where I gathered

as much maiz as I could poſſibly: which with great diligence I conueyed to our fort, to ſuccour my poore men, which I had left in great neceſſitie. They therefore ſeeing me a farre off comming ranne to that ſide of the riuer where they thought I would come on lande: for hunger ſo pinched them to the hearte, that they could not ſtaye vntill the victuals were brought them to the fort. And that they well ſhewed, aſſoone as I was come, and that I had diſtributed that little maiz among them, which I had giuen to ech man, before I came out of the barke: for they eate it before they had taken it out of the huſke. But ſeeing my ſelfe in this extreeme néede, I tooke paynes daye by daye to ſeeke ſome villages, where there was ſome foode. And as I trauailedTwo Carpē
                  ters killed for gathering the Indians maiz. this way and that way, it happened that two of my Carpenters were killed by the two ſonnes of king Emola, and by one whoſe name was Caſti, as they went on walking to the village called Athore. The cauſe of this murder was, becauſe theyThe village Athore. could not refraine themſelues as they walked through the fields from gathering a little maiz, which as they were doing they were taken in the manner: whereof I was preſently aduertiſed by an Indian which a little before had brought me a preſent fromNia-Cubacany a queene. 
               Nia-Cubacani Queene of a village, and neighbour to our forte. Uppon receipt of this aduertiſment, I ſent my ſergeant with a number of ſoldiers, which founde nothing elſe but the two dead corpſes, which they buried, & returned without doing any other exploite, becauſe the inhabitantes were fled away fearing they ſhoulde be puniſhed for ſuch a foule facte. As theſe thinges thus paſſed, & that by this time we had almoſt driuen out the moneth of May, two ſubiectes of king Vtina came vnto mee with an Hermaphrodite, which ſhewed me that by this time ye maiz was ripe in the greateſt part of their quarters. Whereupon Vtina ſignified vnto mee that in caſe I woulde carrie him home to his houſe, he woulde take ſuch good order that I ſhoulde haue plentie of maiz and beanes: and withall, that the fielde which he had cauſed to be ſowed for mee, ſhoulde be reſerued to my vſe. I conſulted with my men concerning this matter, and founde by the aduice of all my companie, that it was beſt to graunt him his requeſt, ſaying, yt he had means to ſuccour vs with food ſufficient to ſerue our turnes for our embarkement, and that therefore I

might do well to carrie him home. Wherefore I cauſed the two barkes forthwith to be made readie, wherein I ſayled to Patica,
               Patica a village. a place diſtant from his village eight or nine leagues, where I founde no body: for they were gotten into the woods, and would not ſhewe themſelues, albeit Vtina ſhewed himſelfe vnto them, for aſmuch as they imagined that I ſhoulde be conſtrayned to let him goe. But ſéeing no body to ſhewe themſelues I was conſtrayned to hazarde one of my men, which had béene acquainted with the ſtate of the countrey, to whome I deliuered the young ſonne of Vtina, and commaunded him to goe with diligence to the village of Vtina, vnto his father in lawe and his wife, to aduertiſe them that if they woulde haue their king agayne, they ſhoulde bring me victuals vnto the ſide of the little riuer whither I was gone. At my mans comming euerie one made much of the litle child, neither was there a man that thought not himſelfe well appaide to touch him. His father in law & his wife hearing of theſe newes came preſently towards our barkes, and brought bread which they gaue vnto my ſoldiers, they held me there thrée dayes, & in the meane while did all y• they could to take me: which preſently I diſcouered, & therfore ſtood diligently vpon my gard. Wherefore perceyuing they could not haue their purpoſe, & that they were already diſcouered, they ſent to aduertiſe mee y• as yet they could not helpe me to victuals, & that the corne was not yet ripe. Thus I was conſtrained to returne & to carry backe Vtina home, where I had much a do to ſaue him frō y• rage of my ſoldiers: which perceiuing y• maliciouſnes of the Indians, went about to haue murdred him. Moreouer it ſéemed they were content that they had gotten y• ſon, & that they cared notgreatly for the father. Now my hope fayling me on this ſide, I deuiſed to ſend my men to the villages, where I thought y• maiz was by this time ripe: I went to diuers places, & continued ſo doing fiftéene dayes after, when as Vtina beſought me againe to ſend him vnto his village, aſſuring himſelfe that his ſubiectes would not ſticke to giue mee victuals: & that in caſe they refuſed ſo to do, he was cōtent that I ſhuld do what I thought good with him. I vndertoke this voiage the ſecond time with the two barkes furniſhed as before. At my comming vnto the litle riuer, we found his ſubiects there, which failed not to come thither, with ſome quantitie of bread, beanes,

and fiſh, to giue my ſoldiers. Neuertheles returning agayne toDeſire of reuenge rooted in the ſauages their former practiſe they ſought almeanes to entrap me, hoping to cry quittance for the impriſonmēt of their king, if they might haue gotten the victory of me. But after that they ſaw the ſmall meanes, which they had to annoy me, they returned to intreaties & offered that if I woulde giue them their king with certaine of my ſoldiers, they would conduct them vnto the village, & that the ſubiects ſéeing him, would be more willing to giue vs victuals. Which thing notwithſtanding I would not grant vnto thē (miſtruſting their ſubtiltie, which was not ſo couerte, but that one might eſpie day at a little hole) vntil they had firſt giuen me two mē in pledge with charge y• by the next day they ſhould bring me victuals. Which thing they granted, & gaue me two men, which I put in chaines, for feare they ſhould eſcape away, as I knewe well they were inſtructed to do. Foure dayes were ſpent in theſe conferences, at the end whereof they declared vnto me, that they could not fully and wholy performe their promiſe: & that the vttermoſt that they could do for the preſent was to cauſe ech ſubiect to bring his burthen of myl. To conclude they were content to do ſo on condition that I would ſend them their two pledges within ten daies. As my lieuetenant was ready to depart, I warnedA neceſſarie admonition. him aboue all things, to take heede hee fell not into the Indians hands: becauſe I knew them to be very ſubtill and craftie to enterpriſe & execute any thing to our diſaduantage. He departed therefore with his troupe, & came to the ſmal riuer whereinto we were accuſtomed to enter to approch as néere as we coulde vnto the village of Vtina, being ſixe french leagues diſtant frō thence. There he went on ſhore, put his men in good array, and drewe ſtreight towards the great houſe that was the kinges, where the chiefe men of y• countrie were aſſembled, which cauſed very great ſtore of victuals to be brought now one & then another, in doing wherof they ſpent notwithſtanding thrée or foure dayes: in which meane while they gathered men together to ſet vpon vs in our retreite. They vſed therfore many means to hold vs ſtill in breath.The Floridians ſubtilties. For one while they demanded their pledges, another while (ſéeing my liuetenant would not yeld to thē, vntill ſuch time as they had brought the victuals vnto the boats, according to the agreement

paſſed betweene vs) they ſignified vnto him that the women and yong children were affraide out of all meaſure to ſee fire in their matches ſo neere their harquebuſes: and that therefore they moſt earneſtly beſought them to put them out, that they might more eaſily get people ynough to carrie the victuals, and that they for theyr partes woulde leaue their bowes, and arrowes, and woulde be contented that their ſeruantes ſhoulde carrie them. This ſeconde requeſt was as flatly denied them as the former: For it was an eaſie matter to ſmell out their intention. But while theſe thinges were thus in handling, Vtina by no meanes was to be ſeene, but hid and kept himſelfe ſecrete in a little houſe a part, where certayne choſen men of mine went to ſee him, ſhewing thēſelues agreeued with him, for the long delayes of his ſubiectes: whereunto hee anſwered, that his ſubiects were ſo much incenſed againſt vs, that by no meanes poſſible he was able to keepe them in ſuch obedience, as he willingly woulde haue done, and that hee coulde not holde them from waging of warre againſt Monſieur De Ottigny. That he alſo called to mind, that euen while he was priſoner, at what time our men ledde him into his countrie to obtaine ſome victuals, hee ſaw along the high waies arrows ſtucke vp, at the ends whereofA certaine ſigne of vvarre long haires were faſtened, which was a certayne ſigne of open warre proclaimed, which arrowes the captaine alſo carried with him to the fort. He ſaide further that in reſpect of the good will he bare the Captaine, he forewarned his Lieuetenant that his ſubiectes were determined to cut downe the trees, and cauſe them to fall a thwhart the little riuer, where the boates were, to keepe them from departing thence, that they might fight with them at their eaſe, and that if it thus fell out, hée aſſured him for his part he woulde not be there to meddle in the matter. And that which much more augmented the ſuſpicion of warre was, that as my meſſengers departed from Vtina, they hearde the voyce of one of my men, which during the voyage had alwayes beene among the Indians, and whome as yet they woulde neuer render, vntil they had gotten their pledges home. This poore fellowe cryed out a mayne, becauſe two Indians would haue carried him into the woods to haue cut his throate: whereupon hee was ſuccoured

and deliuered. Theſe admonitions being well vnderſtoode, and after ripe deliberation thereof Mounſieur, de Ottigny reſolued to retire himſelfe the ſeauen and twentieth of Iuly. Wherefore he ſet his ſoldiers in order, and deliuered to ech of them a ſacke full of myl: and afterward he marched toward his barkes, thinking to preuent the enterpriſe of the ſauages. There is at theAn alley of three or foure hundred paſes long. comming foorth of the village a great alley about threé or foure hundred paſes long, which is couered on both ſides with great trees. My lieutenant diſpoſed his men in this alley and ſet them in ſuch order as they deſired to march: for hee was well aſſured that if there were any ambuſh, it woulde be at the comming out of the treés. Therefore he cauſed Mounſieur De Arlac myne enſigne to march ſomwhat before wt eight harquebuſiers to diſcouer whether there were any danger: beſides he commanded one of my ſergeants and corporalles to march on the out ſide of the alley with foure harquebuſiers while hee himſelfe conducted the reſt of his companie through it. Nowe as he ſuſpected, ſo it fell out: for Mounſieur de Arlac mette with two or thrée hundred Indians at the ende of the alley, which ſaluted him with an infiniteA ſkirmiſh tvveene the Sauages & the French. number of their arrowes, and with ſuch furie that it was eaſie to ſée with what deſire they ſought to charge vs. Howbeit they were ſo wel ſuſtayned in the firſt aſſault which mine enſigne gaue them, that they which fell downe deade, did ſomewhat abate the choler of thoſe which remayned aliue. This done my lieuetenant haſted to gaine grounde in ſuch ſort as I haue already ſaid.A ſecond freſh charge of Sauages. After he had marched about foure hundred paſes, hee was charged afreſh with a newe troupe of ſauages which were in number about threé hundred, which aſſayled him before, while the reſt of the former ſet vppon him behinde. This ſeconde aſſault was ſo valiantly ſuſtained, that I may iuſtly ſay that Monſieur De Ottigny ſo well diſcharged his duetie, as was poſſible for a good Captaine to doe. And ſo it ſtoode them vpon: for he had to deale with ſuch kinde of men, as knew well how to fight & to obey their heade which conducted them, and which knewe ſo well to behaue themſelues in this conflict, as if Ottigny had not preuented their practiſe, he had beéne in danger to haue beéne defeated.The Floridians maner of fight. Their manner in their fight was, that when two hundred had ſhotte, they retyred themſelues and gaue place to the reſt that

were behinde, and all the while had their eye and foote ſo quicke and readie, that aſſoone as euer they ſawe the harquebuſie layde to the cheeke, ſo ſoone were they on the ground, and eftſone vp to anſwere with their bowes, and to flie their way, if by chance they perceyued we went about to take them: for there is nothing that they feare ſo much, becauſe of our ſwordes and daggers. ThisThe Floridians chiefe feare. conflict continued and laſted from nine of the clocke in the morning, vntill the night departed them. And if Ottigny had not bethought himſelfe to cauſe his men to breake the arrows which they founde in the waye, and ſo to depriue the ſauages of the meanes to beginne agayne, without all doubt he ſhould haue had very much to do: for by this meane they lacked arrowes, and ſo were conſtrayned to retyre themſelues. During the time of the conflict they cryed and made ſignes that they were the captaines and lieutenants friendes: and that they fought for none other cauſe but to be reuenged on the ſoldiers, which were their mortall enimies. My lieutenant being come vnto his boates tooke a reuewe of his company, and found two men wanting which wereTvvo ſlaine. killed, of whome the one was called Iames Sale, and the others name was Meſureur. He founde moreouer two and twentie ofTvvo & tvventie vvounded. them wounded, which with much adoe he cauſed to bee brought vnto the boates. All the mill that he found among his company came but to two mens burthens, which hee deuided equally among them. For aſſoone as the conflict beganne, euery man was conſtrained to leaue his ſacke to put his hande vnto his weapon. In this meane while I remayned at the forte, and cauſed euery man diligently to trauell, hoping that my Lieutenant woulde bring vs victuals. But ſeéing the time conſume away, I began to ſuſpect the crueth of that which fell out, whereof I was aſſured immediately after at their returne. Seéing therefore minePraier and thankes vnto God for their deliuerance. hope fruſtrate on that ſide, I made my prayer vnto GOD, and thanked him of his grace which he had ſhewed vnto my poore ſoldiers which were eſcaped: Afterward I thought vppon newe meanes to obtayne victuals, aſwell for our returne into France, as to driue out the time vntill our embarking. I was aduertiſed by certayne of our companie, which vſually went on hunting into the woodes and through the villages, that in the villageThe village Sarauhi.

I ſent alſo to the riuer which the Sauages calThe riuer of Iaracana called by Ribault the riuer of Somme.

Now finding our ſelues by this meane ſufficiently furniſhed with victuals, we began ech of vs in his place, to trauaile & vſe ſuch diligence, as the deſire to ſeé our natiue countrie might moue vs. But becauſe two of our Carpenters were ſlaine by the Indians (as heretofore I mentioned) Iohn de Hais, Maſter carpenter, a man very worthie of his vocation, repaired vnto me, and tolde me that by reaſon of want of men hee was not able to make me vp the ſhip againſt the time that hee had promiſed mee: which ſpeach cauſed ſuch a mutinie among the ſoldiers that verie hardly he eſcaped killing: howbeit I appeaſed them aſwell as I could, and determined to worke no more from thence foorth vpon the ſhippe, but to content our ſelues to repaire the Brigantine which I had. So we beganne to beate downe allThe beating dovvne of the houſes vvithout the fort, & the paliſade. the houſes that were without the forte, and cauſed coales to be made of the tymber thereof: likewiſe the ſoldiers beate downe the palliſade which was towarde the waters ſide, neither was I euer able to keepe them from doing it.

I leaue it to your cogitation to thinke how neere it went to our heartes, to leaue a place aboundingFlorida a rich countrie. in riches (as we were throughly enformed thereof) in cō

As ech of vs were much tormented in minde with theſe or ſuch like cogitations, theAug. 3. 1565. thirde of Auguſt I diſcryed foure ſayles in the ſea, as I walked vppon a little hill, whereof I was exceeding well appaide: I ſent immediately one of them which were with mee to aduertiſe thoſe of the fort thereof, which were ſo glad of thoſe newes, that one would haue thought them to bee out of their wittes to ſee them laugh and leape for ioy. After theſe ſhippes had caſt ancre, we diſcried that they ſent one of their ſhip boates to lande: whereupon I cauſed one of mine to be armed with diligence, to ſend to meete them, and to know who they were. In the meane while fearing leaſt they were Spaniards, I ſet my ſoldiers in order & in readines, attending the returne of Captaine Vaſſeur and my lieutenant, which were gone to meete them, which brought mee word that they were Engliſhmen: & in truth they had in their cō

one whoſe name was Martine Atinas of Diepe, which at that time was in their ſeruice, which on the behalfe of MaiſterMaſter Iohn Havvkins the Engliſh generall. 
               Iohn Hawkins their generall came to requeſt meé that I woulde ſuffer them to take freſh water, whereof they ſtood in great neéde, ſignifiyng vnto me that they had beene aboue fifteéne daies on the coaſt to get ſome. He brought vnto me from the generall two flacons of wine, and bread made of wheate: whichich greatly refreſhed me, foraſmuch as for ſeuen moneths ſpace I neuer taſted a droppe of wine: neuertheleſſe it was all diuided among the greateſt part of my ſouldyers. This Martine Atinas had guided the Engliſhmen vnto our coaſt, wherewith he was acquainted: for in the yeare 1562. he came thither with mee, and therefore the generall ſent him to mee. Therefore after I had graunted his requeſt, he ſignified the ſame vnto the generall, which the next day following cauſed one of his ſmall ſhippes to enter into the ryuer, and came to ſeé me in a great ſhipboate, accompanied with gentlemen honourably apparelled, yet vnarmed. Hee ſent for great ſtore of bread and wine, to diſtribute thereof to euery one: On my part I made him the beſt cheére I could poſſibly, and cauſed certaineSheepe and Poultrie carried into Florida. ſheépe and poultry to bee killed, which vntill this preſent I had carefully preſerued hoping to ſtore the countrie withall. For, notwithſtanding all the neceſſities and ſicknes that happened vnto me, I would not ſuffer ſo much as one chicking to be killed: by which meanes in a ſhort time I had gathered together aboue an hundred Pullets. Now threé dayes paſſed, while the Engliſh general remayned with me, during which tyme the Indyans came in from all parts to ſee hym, and aſked me whether hee were myAn aduantage vviſely taken. brother: I told them he was ſo, and ſignified vnto them, that heé was come to ſeé me and ayde me with ſo great ſtore of victuals, that from thence forward I ſhould haue no neéde to take any thing of them. The bruite hereof incontinently was ſpread ouer all the countrie, in ſuch ſort as Ambaſſadours came vnto me from all parts, which on the behalfe of the kings their maſters deſired to make alliance with mee: and euen they, which before ſought to make warre againſt me, came to offer their friendſhip and ſeruice vnto mee: Whereupon I receaued them and gratified them with certayne preſentes. The generall immediately vnderſtoode the deſire & vrgent occaſion which I had to returne into France:

Whereupon he offred to tranſport me and al my company home: whereunto notwithſtanding I woulde not agreé, being in doubt vpon what occaſion hee made ſo large an offer. For I knewe not howe the caſe ſtoode betweéne the French and the Engliſh: and although he promiſed me on his faith to put me on land in France, before he would touch in England, yet I ſtoode in doubt leaſt heThe French miſtruſted that the Engliſhmen vvould plant in Florida. would attempt ſomewhat in Florida in the name of his miſtreſſe. Wherefore I flatly refuſed his offer: whereupon there roſe a great mutiny among my Souldiers, which ſayd that I ſought to deſtroy them all, and that the Brigantine, whereof I ſpake before, was not ſufficient to tranſport them, conſidering the ſeaſon of the yeare wherein we were. The bruite and mutinye increaſed more and more: for after that the Generall was returned to his ſhips, he told certaine gentlemen and ſouldiers which went to ſee him, partly to make good cheére with him, he declared, I ſay, vnto them, that he greatly doubted that hardly we ſhould bee able to paſſe ſafely in thoſe veſſels which we had: & that in caſe we ſhould enterpriſe the ſame, we ſhoulde no doubt bee in great ieopardye: notwithſtanding if I were ſo contented, hee would tranſport part of my men in his ſhippes, and that hee woulde leaue me a ſmall ſhippe to tranſport the reſt. The Souldyers were no ſooner come home, but they ſignified the offer vnto their companyons, which incontinently conſented together that in caſe I woulde not accept the ſame they woulde embarke themſelues with hym and forſake me, ſo that he would receaue them accordyng to his promiſe. They therefore aſſembled themſelues altogether and came to ſeeke me in my Chamber, and ſignified vnto me their intention, whereunto I promiſed to aunſwere within one houre after. In which meane ſpace I gathered together the principall members of my company, which after I had broken the matter with them, anſwered me all with one voice, that I ought not to refuſe this offer, nor contemne the occaſion which preſented it ſelfe, and that they could not thinke euill of it in France, if being forſaken, as we were, we ayded our ſelues with ſuch meanes as God had ſent vs. After ſundry debatinges of this matter, in concluſion I gaue mine aduiſe, that wee ought to deliuer him the price of the ſhippe which hee was to leaue vs, & that for my part I was contentSyluer found in Florida. to giue him the beſt of my ſtuffe, and the ſiluer which I had

gathered in the Country. Whereupon notwithſtanding it was determined that I ſhoulde keépe the ſiluer, for feare, leaſt the Queéne of England ſeeing the ſame▪ ſhoulde the rather be encouragedNote. to ſet footing there, as before ſheé had deſired: that it was farre better to carry it into France, to giue encouragement vntoThe great importance of this enterpriſe. our Princes not to leaue of an enterpriſe of ſo great importance for our common wealth, and that, ſeéing we were reſolued to depart, it was farre better to giue him our Artillerye, which otherwiſe we ſhould bee conſtrained to leaue behind vs, or to hide it in the ground, by reaſon of the weakenes of our men, being not able to embarke the ſame. This point being thus concluded and reſolued on, I went my ſelfe vnto the Engliſh Generall, accompanied with my Lieutenant, and Captaine Vaſſeur, Captaine Verdier, and Trenchant the Pilot, and my Sergeant, all men of experience in ſuch affaires and knowing ſufficiently how to driue ſuch a bargaine. We therefore tooke a viewe of the ſhippe which the Generall would ſell, whom we drewe to ſuch reaſon, that he was content to ſtand vnto mine owne mens iudgement, who eſteémed it to be worth ſeuen hundred crowns, wherof we agreéd very friendly. Wherfore I deliuered him in earneſt of the ſumme, two baſtards, two mynions, one thouſand of iron, and one thouſand of powder. This bargaine thus made▪ he conſidered the neceſſity wherein we were, hauing for all our ſuſtenance but myl & water: whereuponThe great humanitie and bountie of Maſter Iohn Havvkins to the French. being moued withpitie, he offred to relieue me with twenty barrels of meale, ſix pipes of beanes, one hogſhead of ſalt, and a hundred of waxe to make candels. Moreouer foraſmuch as he ſawe my Souldyers goe barefoote, hee offered me beſides fifty payres of ſhoes, which I accepted and agreéd of a price with hym, and gaue hym a byll of mine hand for the ſame, for which vntill this preſent I am indebted to hym. He did more then this: for particularly he beſtowed vppon my ſelfe a great iare of oyle, a iare of Uynagre, a barill of Olyues, and a great quantitye of Ryce, and a barill of white Biſcuit. Beſides hee gaue diuerſe preſents to the principall Officers of my companye accordyng to their qualities: ſo that I may ſaye that wee receaued as manye courteſies of the Generall, as it was poſſible to receiue of any man liuing. Wherein doubtleſſe hee hath wonne the reputation of a good and charitable man, deſeruing to be eſteémed aſmuch of

vs all as if hee had ſaued all our liues. Incontinent after hisThe departure of the Engliſh Generall departure I ſpared no payne to haſten my men to make biſcuits of the meale which hée had left mée, and to hoope my Caſke to take in water néedefull for the voyage. A man may well thinke what diligence wée vſed, in reſpect of the great deſire wée had to depart, wherein mée continued ſo well, that the fiiftéenth day of Auguſt the biſcuit, the greateſt part of our water, and all theAuguſt. 15. Souldyers ſtuffe was brought aborde: ſo that from that daye forwarde wée dyd nothing but ſtay for good windes to driue vs into France: which had fréed vs from an infinite number of miſchiefes which afterwarde wée ſuffered, if they had come as wée deſired: but it was not Gods good pleaſure, as ſhall appeare hereafter. Being thus in a readynes to ſette Sayle, wée bethought our ſelues that it woulde doe well to bringe certayne men and women of the countrye into France, to the ende, that if thys voyage ſhoulde bee taken in hande agayne, they might declare vnto their Kynges, the greatneſſe of our Kyng, the excellencye of our Princes, the goodneſſe of our Countrye, and the manner of liuyng of the Frenchmen: and that they might alſo learne our language to ſerue our turnes thereby in tyme to come. Wherein I tooke ſo good order, that I had found meanes to bring away with me the goodlyeſt perſons of all the Countrye, if our intentions had ſuccéeded, ad I hoped they woulde haue done. In the meane ſeaſon the Kynges my neighbours came often to ſée and viſite mée: which, after that they vnderſtoode that I woulde returne into France, demaunded of mée whether I meant to returne agayne or no, and whether it ſhoulde bée in ſhort tyme. I ſignyfied vnto them that within tenne Moones (ſo they call their Moneths) I woulde viſite them agayne withThe Floridians meaſure their moneths by the reuolutions of the Moone. ſuch force, that I woulde bée able to make them Conquerours ouer all their enimies. They prayed mée that I woulde leaue them my houſe, that I woulde forbidde my Souldyers to beate downe the fort and their lodginges, and that I woulde leaue them a boate to ayde them withall in their warre againſt their enemies. Which I made as though I would graunt vnto them, to the end I might alwaies remaine their friend vntil my laſt departure.

            THE THIRD VOYAGE of the French men made by Captayne IOHN RIBAVLT vnto FLORIDA.

I ſent alſo to the centinels, which I cauſed to be kept on a little knappe, to cauſe certayne men to clymbe vp to the top of the higheſt tréesNote. the better to diſcouer them. They diſcryed the great beate of the ſhippes, which as yet they could not perfectly diſcerne, which, as farre as they could iudge, ſeemed to chaſe my boat, which by this tyme was paſſed the barre of the Ryuer: ſo that wee coulde not poſſiblye iudge whether they were enemies which woulde haue carryed her away with them: for it was to great a ken to iudge the truth therof. Upō this doubt I put my men in order & in ſuch aray as though they had béen enemies: & in déed I had great occaſion to miſtruſt the ſame: for my boat came vnto their ſhippe about two of the clocke in the afternoone, and ſent me no newes all that day long to put me out of doubt who they ſhoulde bee. The next day in the morning about eight or nyne of the clocke I ſawe ſeuen boates (among which mine owne was one) full of ſouldiers enter into the Ryuer, hauyng euery man his harquebuſe and moryon on hys head, which marched all in battayle along the cliffes where my centinels were, to whom they would make no kynd of aunſwere, notwithſtanding all the demaundes that were made vnto them, in ſo much as one of my ſoldyers was conſtrayned to beſtowe a ſhotte at them without doing hurt neuertheleſſe to any of them, by reaſon of the diſtance betwéene hym and the boates.

The report hereof being made vnto me, I placed ech of my men in his quarter, with full deliberation to defend our ſelues, if they had béene enemies, as in truth wee thought them to haue béene: lykewiſe I cauſed the two ſmall field pieces which I had left mee to be trimmed in ſuch ſort, as if in approching to the fort they had not cryed, y• it was Captayne Ribault, I had not fayled to haue diſcharged the ſame vpon them. Afterward I vnderſtood that the cauſe why they entered in this manner, procéeded of the falſe reportesFalſe reportes of Laudonniere to the Admirall of France. which had béene made vnto my Lorde Admirall by thoſe which were returned into France in the firſt ſhips. For they had put in hys head, that I playde the Lord and the Kyng, and that I would hardly ſuffer that any other ſaue my ſelfe ſhoulde enter in thither to gouerne there. Thus we ſée how the good name of the moſt honeſt is oftentimes aſſayled by ſuch, as hauing no meanes to wyn themſelues credyt by vertuous and laudable endeuours, thinke by debaſ

For it is very hard, yea vtterly vnpoſſible, that in gouerning of a company of men gathered out of diuers places and ſundry Nations, and namely ſuch as we know them to bee in our warres, it is, I ſay, vnpoſſible, but there will be alwaies ſome of euill conditions & harde to be ruled, which eaſily conceaue an hatred againſt hym, which by admonitions and light corrections endeuoureth to reduce them to the diſcypline of warre. For they ſéeke nothing elſe, but for a ſmall occaſion founded vpon a light pretext to found into the eares of great Lordes that which miſchieuouſly they haue contriued againſt thoſe, whoſe execution of iuſtice is odious vnto them. And albeit I will not place my ſelfe in the ranke of great and renowmed Captaines, ſuch as liued in times paſſed, yet wee may iudge by their examples, howe hurtfull backebyters haue béene vnto common-wealths. I will onely take Alcibiades

good ſeruices, & rather beleeuing a falſe report, then hauing had regarde vnto ſo many notable exploytes which in former time he had atchieued. But that I looſe not my ſelfe in digreſſing ſo far in this my iuſtification, I wil returne againe to my firſt courſe. Being therefore aduertiſed that it was Captayne Ribault, I wentLaudonnieres receauing of Captayne Ribault. forth of the fort to goe to méete hym, & to doe hym all the honor I coulde by any meanes, I cauſed hym to bee welcommed with the artillerie, and a gentle voley of my ſhotte, whereunto he aunſwered with his. Afterward being come on ſhore and receaued honorably and with ioy, I brought hym to my lodging, reioycing not a little becauſe that in this company I knew a good number of my friendes, which I intreated in the beſt ſort that I was able, with ſuch victuals as I could get in the country, & y• ſmall ſtore which I had left mee, with that which I had of the Engliſh Generall. Howbeit I maruailed not a little when as all of them with one voice beganne to vtter vnto me theſe or the like ſpeaches. My Captaine, we praiſe God that we haue found you aliue, & chiefly becauſe we know, y• the reports which haue béen made of you, are falſe. Theſe ſpéeches mooued me in ſuch ſort, y• I would néeds out of hand knowe more, miſtruſting ſome euill. Wherefore hauing accoſted Captain Iohn Ribault, & going both of vs aſide together out of y• fort, he ſignified vnto me the charge which he had, praying me not to returne into France, but to ſtay with him my ſelfe & my company, & aſſured me that he would make it well thought of at home. Whereupon I replied that out of this place I woulde doe him all ſeruice: that for the preſent I could not nor ought not accept this offer, ſince he was come for no other intent then to occupie the place which I before poſſeſſed: that I could haue no credit to be there commanded: that my friendes would neuer like of it, and that hee woulde hardly giue me that counſaile, if in good earneſt I ſhould demaund his aduiſe therein. He made me aunſwere, that he would not commaund me, that we ſhould be companions, and that he would builde another fortreſſe, & that he would leaue mine owne vnto mee.

            Nowe after I had longe diſcourſed with Captaine Ribault, Captayne la Grange accoſted me, and told me of an infinite ſight of falſe reportes which had beéne made of me to my great hinderaunce: and among other thinges he informed me, that my Lord1.

Whereunto I aunſwered, that the woman was a poore Chambermayde, which I had taken vp in an Inne, to ouerſeé1.

the countrey withall: that it was not meéte to put a man to attend this buſineſſe: likwiſe, conſidering the length of the time that I was to abide there, me thought it ſhould not offende any body, to take a woman with meé, aſwel to helpe my ſoldiers in their ſickneſſes, as in mine owne, whereinto I fell afterwarde. And how neceſſarie her ſeruice was for vs, ech one at that time might eaſilie perceiue: That all my men thought ſo well of her, that at one inſtant there were ſixe or ſeuen which did demaunde her of mee in marriage (as in verie deéde one of them had her after our returne.) Touching that which was ſaide that I plaide the kinge,2. theſe reportes were made, becauſe I woulde not beare with any thing which was againſt the duetie of my charge and the kings ſeruice. Moreouer, that in ſuch enterpriſes it is neceſſarie for a gouernour to make himſelfe knowen and obeyed, for feare leaſt euery bodie would become a maſter, perceauing themſelues far from greater forces. And that if the tale tellers called this rigour,3. it rather proceéded of their diſobedience, then of my nature leſſe ſubiect to crueltie then they were to rebellion. For the4. laſt poynte, that I had not written to any of the Lords of the Court but by the aduice and commaundement of my Lorde Admirall, which willed me at my departure to ſende part of ſuch thinges as I ſhoulde finde in the countrey vnto the Lords of the Counſell: to thende that being moued by this meane they might deale with the Queéne mother for the continuance of this enterpriſe: that hauing beéne ſo ſmall time in the countrey, continually hindred with building of fortreſſes, and vnlading of my ſhips, I was not able to come by any newe or rare things to ſend thē, whereupon I thought it beſt to content them in the meane while with letters, vntill ſuch time as I might haue longer ſpace to ſerch out the Countrey, and might recouer ſomething to ſende them: the diſtribution of which letters I meant not otherwiſe but to referre to my Lorde Admirals good pleaſure: that if the bearer had forgot himſelfe ſo farre, as that he had broken the couering of the letters, and preſented thē himſelfe for hope of gaine, it was not my commandement. And that I neuer honoured noble5. man ſo much, nor did to any more willing & faithfull ſeruice then to my Lord Admirall, nor euer ſought aduancement but by his meanes. You ſeé how things paſſed for this day. The next day

the Indians came in from all partes, to know what people theſe were, to whome I ſignified that this was hee which in the yeare a thouſande fiue hundred ſixtie and two arriued in this countrie, and erected the piller whiche ſtoode at the entrie of the riuer. Some of them knew him: for in truth he was eaſie to be knowen by reaſon of the greate bearde whiche hee ware. He receaued many preſents of thē which were of the villages neére adioyning, among whom there were ſome that he had not yet forgotten. The kinges Homoloa, Sarauahi, Alimacani, Malica, and Caſti,
               Fiue Indian kings. came to viſite him and welcome him with diuerſe giftes according to their manner. I aduertiſed them that he was ſent thither by the king of Fraunce, to remayne there in my roome, and that I was ſent for. Then they demaunded and prayed him, if it might ſtand with his good pleaſure, to cauſe the marchandiſe that he had brought with him to be deliuered them, and that in fewe dayes they woulde bring him to the mountaines of Apalaſſy,

In thoſe mountaines, as they ſayde, is founde red copper, which they call in their language Sieroa Pira, which is aſmuch to ſay, as redde mettell, whereof I had a peéce, which at the verie inſtant I ſhewed to Captaine Ribault, which cauſed his gold-finer to make an aſſay thereof, which reported vnto him that it was perfect golde. About the time of theſe conferences,Perfect gold. commings and goings of the kings of the countrey, being weakened with my former trauaile, & fallen into a melancholie vpon the falſe reportes that had beéne made of me, I fell into a great continuall feuer, which helde me eight or nyne dayes, during which time Captaine Ribault cauſed his victuals to be brought on ſhore, and beſtowed the moſt part thereof in the houſe which my Lieutenant had built about two hundred paſes without the fort: which he did to thende they might bee the better defended from the weather, and likewiſe to the intent that the meale might be neerer to the bake-houſe, which I had built of purpoſe in thatGood meanes to auoide the danger of fire. place, the better to auoide the danger of the fire, as I ſaid before. But loe how oftentimes miſfortune doth ſerch & purſue vs, euen then when we thinke to be at reſt! lo ſeé what happened after that captaine Ribault had brought vp threé of his ſmall ſhips into the

I report me to you if it could be otherwiſe but theſe men before they went out of Spaine muſt neéds be enformed of the enterpriſe and of thoſe that were to execute the ſame. About ye breake of day they began to make toward our men: but our men which truſted them neuer a deale, had hoiſed their ſayles by night, being ready to cut the ſtringes that tyed them. Wherefore perceiuing yt this making toward our men of the Spaniards was not to do them any pleaſure, and knowing well that their furniture was to ſmal to make head againſt them, bicauſe that ye moſt part of their men were on ſhore, they cut their Cables, left their ankers, and ſet ſaile. The Spaniards ſeéing thē ſelues diſcouered lent thē certaine vol

And the Spaniardes ſeéing they could not rech them, by reaſon that the french ſhips were better of ſaile then theirs, and alſo becauſe they would not leaue the coaſt, turned backe and went on ſhore in the riuer Seloy, which we callThe riuer Seloy or the riuer of Dolphines but eight or ten leagues ouer land from the fort: but it is thirtie dubling the cape by ſea fol. 19. the riuer of Dolphines eight or ten leagues diſtant frō the place where we were. Our men therefore finding themſelues better of ſaile then they, followed them to diſcry what they did, which after they had don, they returned vnto the riuer of May, where captaine Ribault hauing diſcryed thē embarked himſelfe in a great boat to know what newes they had. Being at the entrie of the riuer he mette with the boat of Captaine Couſets ſhippe, wherein there was a good number of men which made relation vnto him of all the Spaniards doings: and how the great ſhip named the Trinitie had kept the ſea, and that ſhe was not returned with thē. They told him moreouer yt they had ſeéne threé Spaniſh ſhips enter into ye riuer of Dolphins, & the other threé remained in ye rode, farther, yt they had put their ſoldiers, their victuals & munitiō on land. After he vnderſtood theſe newes he returned to the fortreſſe, & came to my chamber where I was ſicke, & there in the preſence of ye captaines, La Grange, S. Marie, Ottigny, Viſty, Yonuille, & other gentlemen, he propounded, yt it was neceſſarie for ye kings ſeruice, to embark himſelf with al his forces, & with y• threé ſhips y•
               
were in the rode to ſeéke the Spaniſh fleéte, whereupon he aſked our aduiſe. I firſt replyed, and ſhewed vnto him the conſequence of ſuch an enterpriſe, aduertiſing him among other thinges ofDangerous flawes of wind on the coſt of Florida in ſeptember. the perilous flawes of windes that riſe on this coaſt, and that if it chaunced that he were driuen from the ſhore, it woulde bee verie harde for him to recouer it agayne, that in the meane while they which ſhoulde ſtay in the fort ſhoulde be in feare and danger. The Captaines, Saint Marie, and La Grange declared vnto him farther, that they thought it not good to put any ſuch enterpriſe in execution, that it was farre better to keépe the lande, and doe their beſt endeuour to fortifie themſelues: And that after that the Trinitie (which was the principall ſhippe) were returned, there woulde be much more likelihood to enterpriſe this voyage. This notwithſtanding he reſolued to vndertake it, and that which more is, after he vnderſtoode by king Emola, one of our neighboursKing Emola. which arriued vppon the handling of theſe matters, that y• Spaniards in great numbers were gone on ſhore, which had taken poſſeſſion of the houſes of Seloy, in the moſt part whereof theyA village and a riuer both of that name. had placed their Negros, which they had brought to labour, and alſo lodged themſelues and had caſt diuers trenches about them. Thus for the conſiderations which hee had, and doubtinge (as hee might well doe) that the Spaniardes woulde encampe themſelues there to moleſt vs, and in the ende to chaſe vs out of the countrie, hee reſolued and perſiſted in his embarkment, cauſed a Proclamation to be made, that all ſoldiers that were vnder his charge ſhoulde preſently with their weapons embarke them, and that his two enſignes ſhoulde march: which was put in execution. He came into my chamber, and prayed me to lende him my Lieutenant, mine enſigne, and my ſergeant, and to let all my good ſoldiers, which I had, goe with him, which I denied him, becauſe, my ſelfe being ſicke, there was no man to ſtay in the fort. Thereuppon he anſwered me that I neéded not to doubt at all, & that he would returne the morrow after, that in y• meane ſpace Monſieur De Lys ſhould ſtay behind to looke to al things. Then I ſhewed vnto him that he was chiefe in this countrey, and that I for my part had no farther authoritie: that therefore hee would take good aduiſement what he did, for feare leaſt ſome inconuenience might enſue. Then he tolde me that he coulde doe

no leſſe, then to continue this enterpriſe, and that in the letter which he had receyued from my Lorde Admirall, there was aAn aduertiſment of my Lord Admiral to Captaine Ribault. poſtſcript, which he ſhewed me written in theſe words: Captaine Iohn Ribault, as I was encloſing vp this letter, I receaued a certayne aduice, that Don Pedro Melendes departeth from Spaine to goe to the coaſte of Newe Fraunce: ſee you that you ſuffer him not to encroch vppon you, no more then he would that you ſhould encroch vpon him. You ſeé, (quoth he) the charge that I haue, and I leaue it vnto your ſelfe to iudge if you could doe any leſſe in this caſe, conſidering the certayne aduertiſment that we haue, that they are already on lande, and will inuade vs. This ſtopped my mouth. Thus therefore confirmed or rather obſtinate in this enterpriſe, and hauing regard rather vnto his particular opinion then vnto the aduertiſmentes which I had giuen him, & the inconueniences of the time whereof I had forewarned him, hee embarked himſelfe the eighth ofCaptaine Ribaults embarkment Sept. 8.

I report me to thoſe that knowe what wars meane, if when an enſigne marcheth any ſoldier that hath any courage in him will ſtay behinde, to forſake his enſigne: Thus no man of commaundement ſtayed behinde with meé, for ech one followed him as chiefe, in whoſe name, ſtraight after his arriual, all cryes and proclamations were made. Captayne Grange, which liked not very well of this enterpriſe, was vnto the tenthThe tenth of September. of the moneth with mee, and woulde not haue gone aborde, if it had not beéne for the inſtant requeſtes that Captaine Ribault made vnto him, which ſtaid two dayes in the rode attending vntill La Grange was come vnto him: Who being come aborde they ſet ſayle altogether, and from that time forwarde I neuerA mightie tempeſt the tenth of Sept. ſawe them more. The verie day that he departed, which was the tenth of September, there roſe ſo great a tempeſt accompanied with ſuch ſtormes, that the Indians themſelues aſſured me that it was the worſt weather that euer was ſeéne on that coaſt: where vpon two or threé dayes after, fearing leaſt our ſhippes might be in ſome diſtreſſe, I ſent for Monſieur Du Lys vnto me, to take order to aſſemble the reſt of our people to declare vnto them what neéde we had to fortifie our felues: which was done accordingly: and then I gaue them to vnderſtande the neceſſitie and inconueniences

whereinto we were like to fall, aſwell by the abſence of our ſhips, as by the neérenes of the Spaniards, at whoſe hands we could looke for no leſſe then an open and ſufficient proclamed warre, ſeéing they had taken lande and forcified themſelues ſo néere vnto vs. And if any miſfortune were fallen vnto our men which were at ſea, we ought to make a full accompt with ourſelues that we were to endure many great miſeries, being in ſo ſmall number, and ſo many wayes afflicted as we were. Thus euerie one promiſed me to take paynes: and therefore conſidering that their proportion of victuals was ſmall, and that ſo continuing, they would not be able to doe any great worke, I augmented their allowance: although that after the arriuall of captayne Ribault my portion of vituacls was allotted vnto mee asLaudonniere hardly vſed by Ribault vnto a common ſouldier, nether was I able to geue ſo muche as parte of a bottel of wine to anye man which deſerued it: for I was ſo farre from hauing meanes to doe ſo, that the Captaine himſelfe tooke two of my boates, wherein the reſt of the meale was which was left me of the biſcuits which I cauſed to bee made to returne into Fraunce: ſo that if I ſhoulde ſay that I receaued more fauour at the handes of the Engliſhmen being ſtrangersLaudonniere & his companie begin to fortifie themſelues. vnto mee, I ſhoulde ſay but a truth. Wee began therefore to fortifie our ſelues and to repaire that which was broken downe, principallie towarde the waterſide, where I cauſed threéſcore foote of treés to bee planted, to repaire the Paliſſado with the plankes which I cauſed to bee taken of the ſhippe which I had builded. Neuertheleſſe not withſtanding all our diligence and trauaile, we were neuer able fully to repaire it by reaſon of the ſtormes, which commonly did vs ſo great annoy, that we could not finiſh our incloſure. Perceatting my ſelfe in ſuch extremitie I tooke a muſter of the men, which captaine Ribault had left me,A muſter of the men left in the fort by Ribault. to ſeé if there were any that wanted weapon: I found nyne or ten of them whereof not paſt two or threé had euer drawen ſword out of a ſcabbarde, as I thinke. Let them which haue beene bolde to ſay that I had men ynough left me, ſo that I had meanes to defende my ſelfe, giue eare a little nowe vnto mee, and if they haue eyes in their heads, let them ſe what men I had. Of the nine there were foure but young ſtriplinges, which ſerued Captaine Ribault and kept his dogges, the fift was a cooke: among thoſe

that were without the fort, and which were of the aforeſaide companie of Captayne Ribault, there was a Carpenter of threéſcore yeares olde, one a beérebrewer, one olde Croſſe-bowe maker, two ſhoemakers, and foure or fiue men that had their wiues, a player on the Virginals, two ſeruants of Monſieur Du Lys, one of Monſieur De Beauhaire, one of Monſieur De la Grange, and about foureſcore and fiue or ſixe in all, counting aſwell LackeysFoureſcore & fiue left in the fort with Laudonniere. as women and children. Beholde the goodly troupe ſo ſufficient to defende themſelues and ſo couragious as they haue eſteémed them to be: and for my part I leaue it to others conſideration to imagine whether Captaine Ribault woulde haue left them with mee to haue borrowed my men, if they had beéne ſuch. Thoſe which were left mee of myne owne companie were about ſixteéne or ſeuenteéne that coulde beare armes, and all of them poore and leane: the reſt were ſicke and maimed in the conflicte which my Lieutenant had againſt Vtina. This viewe beéing thus taken, we ſet our watches, whereof wee made two centinels, that the ſoldiers might haue one night freé. Then we bethought our ſelues of thoſe which might bee moſt ſufficient, among whome wee choſe two, one of whom was named Monſieur Saint Cler, and the other Monſieur De la Vigne, to whom we deliuered candles and Lanterns to go round about the fort to viewe the watch becauſe of the foule and foggie weather. I deliuered them alſo a ſandglaſſe or clocke that the centinels might not be troubled more one then the other. In the meane while I ceaſed not, for all the fowle weather nor my ſickeneſſe which I had, to ouerſeé the corps de garde. The night betweene the ninetenth and twentieth of September La Vigne kept watch with his companie, wherein hee vſed all endeuour although it rayned without ceaſing. When the day was therefore come, and that hee ſawe that it rayned ſtill worſe then it did before, hee pitied the centinelles ſo too moyled and wette: and thinking the Spaniardes woulde not haue come in ſuch a ſtrange time, hee let them depart, and, to ſay the trueth, hee went himſelfe vnto his lodging. In the meane while one which had ſomething to doe without the fort, and my trompet which went vp vnto theThe Spaniards diſcryed the 20. of September. rampart perceaued a troupe of Spaniards which came downe from a little knappe. Where incontinently they beganne

to cry alarme, and the trompetter alſo: Which aſſoone as euer I vnderſtoode, foorthwith I iſſued out, with my Target and ſworde in my hande, and gatte mee into the middeſt of the Courte, where I beganne to cry vppon my ſoldiers. Some of them which weee of the forwarde ſort went towarde the breach, which was on the ſouth-ſide, and where the munitions of the artillerie lay, where they were repulſed and ſlaine. By the ſelfeſame placeThe Spaniards enter the fort. two enſignes entred, which immediatly were planted on the walles. Two other enſignes alſo entred on the other ſide toward the Weſt, where there was another brech: and thoſe which were loged in this quarter, and which ſhewed themſelues, were likewiſe defeated. As I went to ſuccour them which were defending the breach on the ſouthweſt ſide, I incountred by chaunce a great companie of Spaniardes, which had alreadie repulſed our menFrancis Iean a traitour to his nation. and were nowe entred, which draue mee backe vnto the court of the fort: being there I eſpied with them one called Francis Iean, which was one of the marriners which ſtoale away my barkes, & had guided & conducted y• Spaniards thither. Aſſoone as he ſaw me, he began to ſay, This is y• Captaine. This troupe was led byDon Pedro Melendes captaine of the Spaniards. a captaine whoſe name, as I thinke, was Don Pedro Melendes: theſe made certaine puſhes at me wt their pikes which lighted on my target. But perceauing y• I was not able to withſtād ſo great a companie, & that the court was already wonne, & their enſignes planted on the ramparts, and that I had neuer a man about me, ſauing one onely whoſe name was Bartholomew, I entred into the yard of my lodging, into which they followed me, and had it not beéne for a tent that was ſet vp, I had beéne taken: but the Spaniards which followed me were occupied in cutting of the Cordes of the tent, and in the meane while I ſaued my ſelfe by the breach which was on the weſt ſide neére vnto my LieutenantesLaudonniers eſcape. lodging, and gate away into the woods: where I founde certaine of my men which were eſcaped, of which number there were threé or foure which were ſore hurte. Then ſpake I thus vnto them: Sirs, ſince it hath pleaſed GOD that this miſchaunce is happened vnto vs, wee muſt neédes take the paynes to gette ouer the Marſhes vnto the ſhippes which are at the mouth of the Riuer. Some woulde neédes goe to a little village which was in the woods, the reſt folowed mee thorough the reédes in the

water, where being able to goe no farther by reaſon of my ſickenes which I had, I ſent two of my men which were with mee, which coulde ſwim well, vnto the ſhips, to aduertiſe them of that which had happened, and to ſend them worde to come and helpe me. They were not able that day to get vnto the ſhips to certifie them thereof: ſo I was conſtrained to ſtand in the water vp to the ſhoulders all that night long, with one of my men which woulde neuer forſake me. The next day morning, beeing ſcarcely able to drawe my breath any more, I betooke mee to my praiers with the ſouldier which was with me, whoſe name was Iohn du Chemin:
               Iohn du Chemin a faithful ſeruant. for I felt my ſelfe ſo feéble, that I was afraid I ſhould dye ſodenly: and in truth if he had not embraced me in both his armes, and ſo held me vp, it had not beéne poſſible to ſaue mee. After wee had made an ende of our praiers, I heard a voice, which in my iudgemēt was one of theirs which I had ſent, which were ouer againſt the ſhips and called for the ſhip boate, which was ſo in deéde: and becauſe thoſe of the ſhips had vnderſtanding of the taking of the fort by one called Iohn de Hais, maſter Carpenter, which fled vnto them in a ſhallop, they had ſet ſayle to runne along the coaſt to ſée if they might ſaue any: wherein doubtleſſe they did very wellThe diligence of the Mariners to ſaue them that eſcaped out of the fort. their endeuour. They went ſtraight to the place where the two men were which I had ſent, and which called them. Aſſoone as they had receiued them in and vnderſtood where I was, they came and found me in a pitifull caſe. Fiue or ſixe of them tooke me and carried me into the ſhallop: for I was not able by any meanes to goe one foote. After I was brought into the ſhalloppe ſome of the Marriners tooke their clothes from their backs to lend them me, and woulde haue carried me preſently to their ſhips to giue me a little Aqua vitae. Howbeit I woulde not goe thither, vntill I had firſt gone with y• boat along the reéds, to ſeéke out the poore ſoules which were ſcattered abroad, where we gathered vp eighteene orAmong thoſe was Iaques Morgues painter yet liuing in the Blacke-Fryers in London. twentye of them. The laſt that I tooke in was y• Nephewe of the Treaſurer le Beau. After we were all come to the ſhips, I comforted them aſwell as I coulde, and ſent backe the boate againe with ſpeéde to ſeé if they coulde finde yet any more. Vpon her returne, the Mariners told me how that Captaine Iames Ribault
               Francis Iean cauſe of this enterpriſe. which was in his ſhippe about two muſkets ſhotte diſtant from the fort, had parled with the Spaniardes, and that Francis Iean
               
came vnto his ſhippe, where he ſtaied a long ſpace, whereat they greatly maruailed, conſidering that hee was the cauſe of this enterpriſe, how he would let him eſcape. After I was come into the ſhip called the Greyhounde, Captain Iames Ribault & Captain Valuot came to ſee me: and there wee concluded to returne into France. Nowe foraſmuch as I founde the ſhippe vnfurniſhed of Captaine, Pilot, Maſter, and Maſters-mate, I gaue aduiſe to chooſe out one of the moſt able men among all the Mariners, and that by their owne voices. I tooke alſo ſixe men out of another ſmall ſhippe, which wee had ſunke becauſe it wanted ballaſt and coulde not be ſaued. Thus I encreaſed the furniture of the ſhip wherein I was my ſelfe embarked, and made one, which had beéne Maſters-mate in the foreſaid ſmall ſhippe, Maſter of mine. And becauſe I lacked a Pilot, I praied Iames Ribault that heé would graunt me one of the foure men that he had in his ſhippe, which I ſhould name vnto him, to ſerue me for a Pilot: he promiſed to giue me them, which neuertheleſſe he did not at the inſtantThe bad dealing of Iames Ribault. when we were readie to depart, notwithſtanding all the ſpeéch I vſed to him, in declaring that it was for the Kinges ſeruice. I was conſtrained to leaue the ſhip behinde me which I had bought of the Engliſh Captaine, becauſe I wanted men to bring her away. For Captain Iames Ribault had taken away her furniture: I tooke away her ordinance onely, which was all diſmounted, whereof I gaue nine pieces to Iames Ribault to carrye into France, the other fiue I put into my ſhippe. The fiue and twentieth of September wee ſette ſayles to returne into France, andOur returne into France the 25. of September 1565. Captaine Iohn Ribault and I kept companye all that daye and the next vntill threé or foure a clocke in the after noone: but becauſe his ſhippe was better at bowling then ours, he kept him to the wind and left vs the ſame day. Thus we continued our voyage, wherein we had maruelous flawes of winde. And about the eight and twentieth of October in the morning at the breake ofOctober. 28. daye wee diſcried the Iſle of Flores, one of the Aſſores, where immediatly vpon our approching to the lande we had a mighty guſt of winde which came from the Northeaſt, which cauſed vs to beare againſt it foure daies: afterwarde the winde came South & Southeaſt, & was alwaies variable.

            THE FOVRTH VOYAGE of the French men into Florida, vnder the conduct of Captaine GOVRGVES, in the yeare, 1567.
            
            
               CAptaine Gourgues a Gentleman borne in the country neére vnto Bordeaux incited with a deſire of reuenge, to repaire the honour of his nation, borrowed of his friendes and ſoulde part of his owne goods to ſet foorth & furniſh three ſhips of indifferent burthen with all things neceſſarie, hauing in them an hundred and fiftye Souldiers, and foureſcore choſen Mariners vnder Captaine Cazenoue his Lieutenant, & Francis Bourdelois Maſter ouer the Mariners. He ſet foorth the two and twentieth of Auguſt 1567. And hauing endured contrary windes and ſtormes for a ſeaſon at length hee arriued and went on ſhoare in the Iſle of Cuba. From thence he paſſed to the Cape of Saint Antony at the ende of the Iſle of Cuba, about two hundred leagues diſtant from Florida, where the Captaine diſcloſed vnto them his intention which hitherto hee had concealed from them, praying and exhorting them not to leaue him being ſo neére the enemie, ſo well furniſhed, & in ſuch a cauſe: which they all ſware vnto him, and that with ſuch courage that they would not ſtay the full Moone to paſſe the chanell of Bahama, butThe chanel of Bahama betweene Florida & the Iſles of Lucayes. ſpeédily diſcouered Florida, where the Spaniards ſaluted them with two Canons ſhotte from their fort, ſuppoſing that they had beéne of their Nation, and Gourgues ſaluted them againe to entertaine them in this errour, that he might ſurpriſe them at more aduantage, yet ſailing by them, and making as though he went to ſome other place vntill hee had ſailed out of ſight of the place ſo that about euening, he landed fifteén leagues from the fort, at the mouth of the Ryuer Tacata courou, which the Frenchmen calledThe French mens landing at the Riuer Tacata courou

to aſſure them, that they were come thither for none other end but to renue the amitie and auncient league of the French with them. The Trompettour did his meſſage ſo well (by reaſon he had beéne there before vnder Laudonniere) that he brought backe from king Satourioua, the greateſt of al the other kings, a kidde and other meat to refreſh vs, beſides the offer of his friendſhip and amitie. Afterward they retired daunſing in ſigne of ioy, to aduertiſe all the kings Satouriouaes kinſmen to repair thither the next daye to make a league of amitye with the French men. Whereupon in the meane ſpace our generall went about to ſound the chanel of the Riuer to bring in his ſhippes, and the better to trafficke and deale with the ſauages, of whom the chiefe the next day in the morning preſented themſelues, namely the great king Satourioua, Tacatacourou, Halmacanir, Athore, Ha

Then ſent they to intreate the French Generall to come on ſhoare, which hee cauſed his men to doe with their ſwords & harquebuſies, which he made them leaue behind them, in token of mutuall aſſuraunce leauing his men but their ſwordes onely, after that the ſauages complaining thereof had left and likewiſe ſent away their weapons at the requeſt of Gourgues. This done Satourioua going to meéte him, cauſed him to ſitte on his right hand in a ſeate of woode of lentiſque coueredThe kings ſeat with moſſe made of purpoſe like vnto his owne. Then two of the eldeſt of the companye pulled vp the brambles and other weédes which were before them, and after they had made the place very cleane, they all ſate round about them on the ground. Afterwarde Gourgues beeing about to ſpeake, Satourioua preuented him, declaring at large vnto him the incredibleComplaints of the ſauages againſt the Spaniards. wronges, and continuall outrages that all the ſauages, their wiues and children had receaued of the Spaniards ſince their comming into the country and maſſacring of the Frenchmen, with their continuall deſire if we would aſſiſt them throughly to reuenge ſo ſhamefull a treaſon, aſwell as their owne particular griefes, for the firme good will they alwaies had borne vnto the Frenchmen.

From Saracary vnto theſe ſmall forts wasThe Ryuer of Saracary, or Sarauahi. two leagues ſpace, which hee found very painefull becauſe of the had waies and continuall raynes. Afterward hee departed from the ryuer Cata couru with tenne ſhotte, to viewe the firſt fort, and to aſſault it the next daye in the morninge by the breake of daye, which he coulde not doe, becauſe of the fowle weather and darknes of the nighte. Kinge Helicopile ſeinge him oute of quiet in that he had failed of his purpoſe there, aſſured him to guide him a more eaſie waye, though it were farther aboute. In ſomuche as leading him through the woods, he brought him within ſighte of the fort, where hee diſcerned one quarter which was but begun to bee entrenched. Thus after hee had ſounded the ſmall riuer that falleth downe thereby he ſtayed vntill tenne of the clocke in the morninge for an ebbe water that his men might paſſe

In the meane while the Gouernour ſent a SpaniardA notable Spaniſh ſubtilty. diſguiſed like a Sauage to ſpie out the ſtate of the French. And though he were diſcouered by Olotocara, yet he vſed all the cunning he coulde poſſibly to perſwade them y• he was one of the ſecond fort, out of which hauing eſcaped, & ſeéing none but ſauages on euery ſide, he hoped more, as he ſaid, in the Frenchmens then in their mercy, vnto whom he came to yeéld himſelfe diſguiſed like a ſauage, for feare leaſt, if he ſhould haue béen knowen, he ſhoulde haue beéne maſſacred by thoſe Barbarians: But the ſpie beeing brought face to face with the Sergeaunt of the band, and conuicted to be one of the great fort, was reſerued vntill an other time: after that he had aſſured Gourgues that the bruit was that he had two thouſand Frenchmen with him, for feare of whom the two hundred and threéſcore Spaniardes which remained in the great fort, were greatly aſtonied. Whereupon Gourgues being reſolued to ſet vpon them while they were thus amazed, and leauing his ſtanderd-bearer and a Captaine with fifteéne ſhotte to keépe the fort and the entrye of the riuer, he cauſed the ſauages to depart by night to lye in ambuſh within the woodes on both ſides of the riuer, then he departed in the morning, leading the Sergeaunt and the ſpie faſt bound along with him to ſhewe him that in deéde, which they had onely made him vnderſtand before in paynting. As they marched Olotocara a reſolute ſauage which neuer left the Captaine, ſaide vnto him, that hee had ſerued him faithfully and done whatſoeuer he had commaunded him, that he was aſſured to die in the conflict at the great fort, wherein neuertheleſſe hee woulde not faile though it were to ſaue his life: but hee

To whom Captaine Gourgues aunſwered, after he had commended his faithful valure, the loue towarde his wife, and his noble care of immortall honour, that hee deſired rather to honour him aliue then dead, and that by Gods helpe he woulde bring him home againe with victorie. After the diſcouery of the fort the Spaniards were no niggards of their Canon ſhotte, nor of two double coluerines, which beeing mounted vppon a bulwarke commaunded all along the Ryuer, which made captain Gourgues to get to the hil couered wt wood, at the foote whereof the Fort beginneth, and the forreſt or woode continueth and ſtretcheth foorth beyond it: ſo that he had ſufficientNote. couerture to approch thereunto without offence. He purpoſed alſo to remaine there vntill the morning wherein hee was reſolued to aſſault the Spaniardes by ſcaling their walles on the ſide toward the hill where the Trench ſeémed not ſufficiently flanked for the defence of the courtaines, and from whence parte of his men might drawe them that were beſieged, which ſhoulde ſhewe themſelues to defend the rampart while the reſt were comming vp. But the Gouernour haſtened his vnhappye deſtinye, cauſing threéſcore ſhotte to ſallie foorth, which paſſing thorough the Trenches aduaunced forwarde to diſcry the number and valure of the French, whereof twenty vnder the conduct of Cazenoue, getting betweéne the Fort and them which nowe were iſſued foorth, cutte of their repaſſage, while Gourgues commanded the reſt to charge them in the front, but not to diſcharge but neére at hande, and ſo that they might be ſure to hitte them, that afterwarde with more eaſe they might cutte them in pieces with their ſwords. So that turning their backes aſſoone as they were charged, and compaſſed in by his Lieutenaunt, they remained all ſlaine vppon theThe ſlaughter of the Spaniards of the third Fort. place. Whereat the reſt that were beſieged were ſo aſtonied that they knewe none other meane to ſaue their liues, but by fleéing into the Wooddes adioyning, where neuertheleſſe beéing encountred agayne by the Arrowes of the Sauages which lay in waight there for them (whereof one ranne thorough the target and bodie of a Spaniarde, which therewithall fell downe

The fort when it was taken was found well prouided of all neceſſaries: namely of fiueThe taking of the third Fort. double coluerines, and foure mynions, with diuers other ſmall pieces of all ſorts, and eighteéne groſſe cakes of gunnepowder, all ſorts of weapons, which Gourgues cauſed with ſpeéde to bee embarked, ſauing the powder & other moueables, by reaſon it was all conſumed with fire through the negligence of a ſauage, which in ſeéthing of his fiſh, ſette fire on a traine of powder which was made and hidden by the Spaniardes to haue feaſted the French at the firſt aſſault, thus blowing vp the ſtore houſe and the other houſes built of pyne treés. The reſt of the Spaniards being led away priſoners with the others, after that the General had ſhewed them the wrong which they had done without occaſion to all the French Nation, were all hanged on the boughes of the ſame treés whereon the French hunge: of which number fiue were hanged by one Spaniarde, which perceiuing himſelfe in the like miſerable eſtate confeſſed his fault, and the iuſt iudgement which God had brought vppon him.

Afterward conſidering hee had not men inough to keépe his Forts which he had wonne, much leſſe to ſtore them, fearing alſo leaſt the Spaniarde which hath dominions neére adioining ſhould renew his forces, or the Sauages ſhould preuaile againſt the French men, vnleſſe his Maieſtie would ſend thither, hee reſolued to raze them. And in deéde, after hee had aſſembled, and in the end perſwaded, all the ſauage kinges ſo to doe, they cauſed their ſubiects to runne thither with ſuch affection, that they ouerthrewe all the threé Forts flatte euen with the ground in one day.The three Forts razed.

Briefly being arriued, and finding his ſhippes ſet in order, and euery thing readie to ſet ſayle, he counſelled the kings to continue in the amitie and auncient league, which they had made with the king of Fraunce, which woulde defend them againſt all Nations: which they all promiſed, ſhedding teares becauſe of his departure, Olocotara eſpecially: for appeaſing of whom he promiſed them to returne within twelue Moones (ſo they count the yeares) and that his king woulde ſend them an army, and ſtore of knyues forKniues in great eſtimation. preſentes, and all other thinges neceſſarye.

After the cheere and good entertainement which hee receaued of thoſe of Rochell, hee ſayled to Bordeaux to enfourme Monſieur Monluc of the thinges aboue mentioned, albeit hee was aduertiſed of eighteene Pinneſſes, and a great ſhippe of two hundred Tunnes full of Spaniardes, which beeing aſſured of the defeat in Florida, and that he was at Rochell, came as farre as Che-de Bay, the ſameChe-de Bay. day that hee departed thence, and followed him as farre as Blay (but he was gotten already to Bordeaux) to make him yeelde another account of his voyage, then that where with he made many

The Catholicke king being afterwarde infourmed that Gourgues coulde not eaſilye be taken, offered a great ſomme of money to him that coulde bringe him his heade, praying moreouer king Charles to do iuſtice on him as of the authour of ſo bloudye an art contrarye to their alliaunce and good leage of friendſhippe. In ſo much as comming to Paris to preſent himſelfe vnto the king, to ſignifie vnto him the ſucceſſe of his voyage, and the meanes which he had to ſubdue this whole country vnto his obedience, (wherein hee offered to employe his life, and all his goods,) he found his entertainement and aunſwere ſo contrarye to his expectation, that in fine hee was conſtrained to hide himſelfe a long ſpace in the Court of Roan, about the yeare 1570. And without the aſſiſtaunce of Preſident Marigny, in whoſe houſe hee remained certaine daies, and of the receiuer of Vacquieulx, which alwaies was his faithfull friende, hee had beene in great daunger. Which grieued not a little Dominicke de Gourgues, conſidering the ſeruices which hee had done aſwell vnto him as to his predeceſſours kinges of Fraunce. HeeThe birth, life and death of Captaine Gourgues. was borne in Mount Marſan in Guyenne, and employed for the ſeruice of the moſt Chriſtian kinges in all the armies made ſince theſe twentye fiue or thirtie yeares: at laſt hee had the charge and honour of a Captaine, which in a place neere vnto Siene, with thirty Souldyers ſuſtained the brunt of a part of the Spaniſh Army, by which beeing taken in the aſſault, and hauing all his men cutte in pieces, hee was put into a galcy in token of the good warre and ſingular fauour which the Spaniarde is wont to ſhewe vs. But as the galey was going toward Sicillie beeing taken by the Turkes, ledde away to Rhodes, and thence to Conſtantinople, it was ſhortly afterwarde recouered by Romeguas, commaunder ouer the army of Malta. By this meane returning home, he made a voyage on the coaſt of Affrica, whence hee tooke his courſe to Breſil, and to the ſouth Sea. At length being deſirous to repaire the honour of Fraunce he ſette vpon Florida with ſuch ſucceſſe as you haue heard. So that being become by his continuall warlike actions both by land and Sea, no leſſe valiant Captaine then ſkilfull Mariner, hee hath made himſelfe feared of the Spaniard, and acceptable vnto the Queéne of England for the deſert of his vertues.
