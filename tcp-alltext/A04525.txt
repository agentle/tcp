            The French King shalbe driven out of his land by his owne Subjects / for he shall excercise tyrannie against the Professours of the Gospell of Christ / therto styrred up / & sporred forwards by the Priests and Bishopps. Who being with money bought treacherouslie to betray him / shall mislead and deliver him / yet he shall seeme to doe the same in respect of his Freinds / and being thrust out and deceived / he shalbe left and forsaken of those whom he most trusted to / this shall happen in the end of the second course of tyme / then the Armes hang on a drie or witherdstock. Now this is understood as passed, in the time of H. de valoys.
            
            The Lion prepares for his yong a strong and everlasting neast / but none of the same shall possesse it / though they were set in it / but when the Lion shall fal into the third course of tyme / then shall there foorthwith be elected in his place a zealous resolute person / by name Frederick on the Rhyn / by Aken / whose ofspring shall stretch it selfe to the end of World / for the end is at hand.
            The King of Fraunce after being a wearie of banishment / and Crosses turning / about shal joyn himselfe to the assemblie of the Christians / striving against the enemies of the Word / and be received again of his own / for in those tymes shall the Christian Church there have no other Antistes nor head.
            The Pope sheweth the declining and help-seeking Emperour the Ballaunce / saying: ponder with your self and consider wheither I have any place at Rome or not / for I am quite of all except your helpe / otherwise I should hold my oath / but the R. C. shalbe remooved to Ments.
            Their Bishoppricks shall get others / who shall with more fruite of Godlines and lesse pride raygne then the other have done.
            In the yeares 67. and 68. shall these things come to passe / and he that shall then live shall much admire the peace / unitie / rest / and ease among men. For there shallbe so great Slaughters and Bloodshed that those very few / which remayn over / shal see and have God and the old Peace to dwel with them / and that for a certayne space of tyme.
            At the same time shall the Pope Cardinalls Archbishops / and all Spiritual states by divers punishments and suffering be driv'ne unto the former life of the Apostles
            I Capis: Serv: of Ies; Chr: after this have seen in a vision 4. streames / from the 4. corners of the World / in strife with the great Seo / who when they could not get the victorie came Oceanus / but Oceanus & the 4. streames overmaysterd the great Sea.
            
               By Oceanus compared vvith the great Sea, the interpreters understand the Iland of Brittayne.
            
            
               O Pope, o Duke of Millyane, how faeminine is thy warre, how woman like are they that depend on thee, wheras al warre bends itselfe against thee, to the end that thou mayst fal.
               The Hellish Dragon his Counsel giver.
               All the Empires of the world shalbe cast vnder our feete.

            This strange Figure hath beene thus drawne / and paynted out two hundred Yeares afore the byrth of Carolus M: and found in a stone Wall / but then alltogeither without any interpretation therby / onelie that by the one person was written the name of Carolus / by the other the Pope; neither did any man presume to foretell or prognosticate any thing therout / save onelie Mr. Iohn Carion, who fortold the death of some / although not wholly so well as this figure / for he fayled 10 yeares in his accoumpt. But there hath lived in our tymes a Moonk in a Cloyster in Slesia / named Capistranus, who was highlie esteemed / and of great accoumpt among the Mathematicians / and in many things (as it is sayd) a Prognosticatour and a Prophet. Who as he chaunced to get this Figure / which was of it selfe without any explication therof therby / he laboured very diligentlie / to discover the misteries therof / and by al means to make knowne the secrets of the same / but when he saw his labour lost and all in vayne / he committed therfore the revelation therof wholly unto God / not long after which tyme appeared a very fearfull Commeet in the Firmament / by meanes wherof began the revolution of the same / and by Calculating uppon that Celestiall Figure / with examining and curious looking therinto / he found that it threatned all Germanie / and the Romayne Empire / with great destruction and ruine / then caused he this Figure to be drawen uppon a Francine or Parchement / and carefully shutting the same into a clefte of a wall / leaving ther a marckable signe / wherby it might after his death be found out dispersed and divulged / it was in Anno 1548. when I gotte the same of hem that found it.
            I Capistranus a Servant of God have seen by the revelation of the most High / the signification of this Figure / even through Calculating uppon the fearfull Commeet / the variation of tymes and Empires. Namely that in the yeare 1547. shall arise a very bitter enemie of the word of God / while he shall give himselfe out for a defender of the same / then by falshood and deceit pretending to joyn with the Duitch Princes / he shall seeme to set before them the disobedience of some particular men / as also a pretense for the reformation of the Church / this shall from North and south bring great destruction with it / al these things notwithstādinge he shal chastise the foolish bewitched Germaynes with their owne weapons / and oppresse the heads of the Empire / in the first course of tyme he shall without bloodshed have all to his owne will / he shall enlarge the corners of / or between his Columns or Pillars / in those 3. yeares shall he deprive them of their might and Priviledge. In the second course shal he priviledge and make free al those of his beliefe labour to breake downe and destroy Gods building / & to curbe those that withstand him: than shal the desolate Dukes and Princes see that they are deceived / and shalbe possessed with terrour and feare on every side. In these 3. yeares shall he attempt to doe many things / but in respect of the manyfold troubles that shal come / he shallbe hindered from his deseignes / yet he shall give no credit unto the traytours / and he shall in all quarters shed much Christian blood. In the thyrd cours he shall in a kind of a Phrensie bring a number lesse multitude of all sorts of people / for to roote out and displant both the word of God and the Christian Princes / and so shall there be every where madnes and bloodshed / then shall there be elected a King / who notwithstanding his being a King / he shall not be honourd with Kinglie honour / yet many shall depend uppon him. In these 3. yeares shall they bring Carolus his ofspring and posteritie / with all his Confederates and adherentes under subjection and obedience.
