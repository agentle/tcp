                  Now here I lye, my friends doe fly,
                  My wench doth quite forsweare me,
                  Her fathers house is but hard by,
                  and yet she comes not neere me mee:
                  In prison I for her doe lie,
                  Close by her fathers doore:
                  And young men all now by my fall,
                  take heed trust not a whore:
               
               
                  My Creditors they chafe at me,
                  For my time spent so bad,
                  And scarse I see no friend I haue,
                  is for my griefe now sad:
                  And those that loud in sormer times,
                  They now doe me abhore:
                  Then youngmen all now by my fall,

                  My kinsfolkes they doe send to me,
                  And often me doe raile,
                  Now am I plagud in misery,
                  Heere lying in the Iayle:
               
               
                  
               
               
                  But if that I come out againe,
                  Though I be nere so poore:
                  I neuer more will giue consent,
                  to meddle with a whore.

                  For if you still will follow whores,
                  they will deuore you all:
                  Your quoine, your states, your health and friends.
                  Then turne you oat of doore:
