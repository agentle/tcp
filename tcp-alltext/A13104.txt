            To the right worshipfull, vertuous, and godly Gentlewoman mistresse Katherine Milward, most faithfull spouse to the no lesse worshipfull, wise and religious Gentleman, master William Milward, esquire, P. S. wisheth all hapie successe in this life, with increase of worship, and in the life to come, eternall felicitie in the heauenlie Hierarchie by Iesus Christ.
            
               TWo things per aduenture (right worshipfull) may be maruailed at,

concerning this litle booke, as namely, first why I haue published it, considering the great number of bookes, either of the same, or verie like argument, extant in these dayes. Secondly, wherfore I haue dedicated it rather vnto you, then to anie other. For the first, I protest before God, who knoweth the secrets of all hearts, I haue not published it, either for vainglory, lucre, or

gaines, nor yet for any other priuate respect of my owne whatsoeuer, but at the instant request, and earnest desire of one of my verie good friends, and alliance also, who yet being liuing, and the onely man that hath borne the whole charges of the impression thereof, both can, and I know will (if need should require) iustifie the same, against any that should auerre the contrarie. And

for the second, when I considered with myselfe, howe much b und I haue alwaies beene to your worship, euer since the time that I was first acquainted with you, for your good opinion you haue euer cōceiued of me, & sundrie other your courtesies shewed towards me, far beyond my deserts or expectation: As also when I called to remembrance your feruent zeale 
                  •
               hich you

haue euer borne to the word of God, & holy religion, your exquisite knowledge therein, your carefull indeuour to put the same in practise, and to frame your life therafter. Briefly, when I remembred your maruailous humilitie and lowlinesse of mind, your wonderfull modestie, gentlenesse and affabilitie, your rare continencie and integritie of life, with infinite the like vertues and graces,

wherewith God hath beautified & adorned your worship aboue manie others, I say, when I remembred these things, with many mo, I could do no lesse (hauing so fit an occasion giuen me, by reason of my friends importunacie) then to dedicate these my labors to your worship, though not as a guerdon answerable to your deserts, yet as an infallible testimonie, pledge and token

of my thankful good wil and gratefull heart towards you. And albe it that in respect of the form or methode of the booke (for herein I haue not studied to be curious) it may seeme to be base and contemptible, and such as is farre vnworthie to be exhibited, to so wise, so discreet, so godly and religious a gentlewoman, yet in regard of the matter, which is heauenlie and diuine, I

most humbly beseech you to accept therof, and to permit the same to go forth to the view of the worlde vnder the gard of your protection, and to patronize both the author & the booke against the poysoned tongues of railing Phormions, and flouting Momusses, to whom all good things are had in disdaine. And in so doing, both God shall bee glorified by you, the church & Saints

shall praise God in you, and I my selfe besides that I will not rest vnthankfull to you to the death, will not cease also to pray to God for you. And t

lack of due cōsideration, or the presse thorow want of diligent attention, thou wilt yet, either friendly amend it with thy pen, or else silently passe it ouer. And if any thing seem harsh, rough or vnfiled, thinke that in this kind of argument I haue not studied to be curious & besides, impute the cause thereof to straitnesse of time, which would not suffer mee so much as to write out my copy twise, nor being once writ, scarce to

read it ouer againe. Thus friendly Reader I cōmit thee to God, praying thee to censure al things to ye best, and to helpe mee with thy praiers that both thou and I, and all the elect of God, in his good time appointed, may come to the full fruition, and possession of all the ioyes and glorie of heauen, which God the father hath promised vnto vs, thorow his sonne Iesus Christ our Lord and Siuio

                  Easter Tearme beginneth seuentene dayes after Easter, and endeth foure dayes after

                  The Queenes Maiesties Iudges neither sit in Westminster

                        . Consider howe that this blessed God, being diuided into a Trinitie of persons, the Father the

Sonne, and the holie Ghost, yet all one in substance and essence, hath by his almightie power created all things both spirituall and temporall, visible and inuisible whatsoeuer. And as he hath created them by his omnipotent power, so doth hee rule and gouerne them by his prouidence, according to his good will and pleasure. And therefore think that nothing commeth to passe by fortune or chance, but by his heauenlie

determination, and appointment. Consider how he hath created thée after his owne si
                           •
                        itude and likenesse, and therefore oughtest thou to be holic, as he is holie. How he hath predestinate and chosen thee before the foundations of the world were layde, to euerlasting saluation in Iesus Christ: how he hath and doth iustifie thee, that is, acount thée iust and righteous by a true and liuelie fayth in the blood of his Sonne: howe

he doth call thée to the knowledge of his will, and to the state of grace. First by the secret working of his spirite, secondlie, by the preaching of his word: thirdlie, by the sight and vse of all his creatures of infinite varietie. Confider howe he made thée holy, pure and righteous, and howe thou by thy rebellion, pride, infidelitie, and disobedience, madest thy selfe sinsull and wicked. Then consider, howe hee sent his owne

sonne Christ Iesus to redéeme thée by the shedding of his blood. Who as he is our onelie saniour and redéemer, so is he our onelie mediator and aduocate, and onelie to be called vppon & inuocated, and neither Angel nor saint, martyr nor confessor, patriarch nor father, nor any other creature whatsoeuer. Consider with thy selfe, that as he hath fulfilled all things for vs, & reconciled vs to his father, so is he now ascended

into the heauens, to prepare a place for vs, who at the great day of accounts shall come againe in the same shape, and with the same bodie that he receyued of Marie, to iudge both the quicke and the dead, and to rewarde euerie man according to his works. Thinke that after the generall iudgement, our bodies being made immortall, and incorruptible, shall bee vnited againe to their proper soules, and for euer inherite

the euerlasting kingdome of heauen, where is such ioy, as no heart can conceiue, no tongue, no not of Angels themselues expresse, nor any penne is able to write. These and the like meditations ended, render most heartie thanks vnto god in the name of Iesus Christ, for all his benefites and blessings in mercie bestowed vppon thee, pray for grace to bee thankfull, craue pardon for

hee hath giuen to thy bodie that night. Pray for his protection, and assistance, in the residue of thy life: which done, meditate thus with thy selse.

charter of my yeares, no not for one minute of an houre, or twinckling of an eye. Death, yea infinite deathes daylie waite vpon me, and threaten my destruction: yea my body it self, earieth in finit deaths in it selfe, being indéed the efficient cause of it owne miserie and calamitie.

the tribunall seat of God, all naked as euer thou wast borne, there to receiue either the incorruptible crowne of euerlasting glorie, or else the iust rewarde of perpetuall confusion. Thinke also, that as thou risest forth of thy bed to be occupied and emploied in the labours and trauailes of this life, so shouldest thou arise out of the bed of sinne, to serue the liuing God, in holines and righteousnes all the dayes of thy life.

to the whole worlde, in vnspeakable glorie, to iudge all flesh, and to reward euerie worke vnder the Sunne according to the qualitie, and merite of the same. Thinke also what infinite glorie is treasured vp in the kingdom of heauen, for the elect and chosen of God, after this life. For if this Sunne in the element (being made but one lie for mans vse, and to giue light to the world for a time) bee so glorious as no mortall

eie without teares can beholde the same, how much more glorious shall we think the ioies of heauen to be, prepared for the elect after this life? Thinke also, that the Sunne in the element doth not onelie giue light to the world by his radiations and glistering beames, but also doth quicken, reuiue, fructifie, and cause to growe all naturall thinges vpon the whole face of the earth: so Christ Iesus the sonne of

God, doth not onelie inlighten man by the beames of his grace, and inspiration of his holie spirite, but also doth reuiue and quicken both our bodies, and our soules, being dead in sin, and also maketh vs fruitfull and plentifull in all good workes, to the praise and glorie of his holie name. Thinke also of the immensitie of this visible Sunne, which beeing in appearance but a small creature, yet such is the maiestie and

glorie thereof, that it conueyeth his beames vnto euerie corner of the earth: and thereby gather thou, the immensitie and vnmeasurablenes of the son of God Christ Iesus, who being the verie light and life of the world, sitteth as a most glorious sonne in the middest of his creatures, imparting to euerie one of them certaine sparkes of his glorie, which beeing taken away, they all consume and come to nothing.

ended, humble thy selfe before God, and pray as followeth, or otherwise as the spirit of God shall

sustentation of mans bodies, sanctifie, I beseech thee, these thy creatures by the power of thy worde, giue them strength to nourish my bodie, and me grace to vse them to thy glorie, and my owne comfort. And as in mercie thou doest feede my bodie with these earthlie creatures, which are transitorie; so vouchsafe to feede my soule with the spirituall foode of thy blessed word, which is euerlasting, and neuer shall

decay, thorow Jesus Christ my onelie Lord and sauiour, and for hs sake.

corporall sustenance, is flesh and bloud; so the mouth of my soule, whereby I receyue the spirituall foode of eternall life, is faith towardes God, hope in his promises, & loue from a pure heart towards ye brefhren for his sake. Thinke also, that as ye Sun is now in his highest ascent & degrée, and therefore of necessitie must néedes decline, and go downward: And as the day also is now at the midst, or full, and therefore must needs

in like maner draw towards his end; so my life being once come to his full ripenesse and maturitie, must of force draw towards his end, which is death, the reward or salary of sinne. These things thus performed, dispose thy selfe to the labors of thy vocation, as before, doing all things to the glorie of him that made thée, and one day will require a straite account of thée for all thy labours and workes done vnder the Sunne.

Remember that nature is satisfied with a little, and what is more then wil suffice nature, is super fluous, and one daie thou shalt be accomptable for

canst not without shame stand before men, naked and bare, so canst thou not without shame and confusion of face, stand before the maiestie of God, except thou be clothed & muested with the garment of Christs righteousnes and holines.

And as it maie please thée to graunt to my bodie quiet rest and sléepe; so let it bee thy good pleasure to make my soule watchful and vigilant to waite vpon thee, and diligentlie to looke for y• comming of thy deare sonne Iesus Christ vnto iudge ment for my redemption. Kéepe me from al fearefull dreams, and visions, from all phantasticall

apparitions, & diuelish illusions of the wicked enemie, from all carnall pollusions, & vngodlie suggestions of the wicked spirit. Finallie graunt, that both my bodie and my soule, resting vnder thy diuine protection, may be safe from all enmitie and hostilitie whatsoeuer, and at the last may attaine euerlasting life, thorow Iesus Christ my onelie Sauiour and redéemer. This done, dispose thy selfe to rest, committing

both thy bodie and soule into the hands of God, praying him to be thy watchman that night. Then discend thou into the secret closets and priuie chambers of thine heart, search euerie place, and ransacke euerie corner: and if thou findest anie filthinesse or vncleannes therein (as in deed thou shalt, find nothing else) wash it away with the teares of repentance, & make itcleane with the broome of contrition. Then thinke thus

with thy selfe. My bed dooth represent vnto me my graue, wherein I must once sléepe, and the clothes, the earth, where with all I shall shortlie be couered in my sepulchre or graue. And as these flees and gnats do bite and gnaw my skinne, so shall the wormes, cate and consume the frame of my bodie, in the dust of the earth, when the Lord doth please. When the morning beginneth to dawn and the daystarre to appeare,

thinke thus. As nowe the morning commeth on, and the daie starre beginneth to appeare, so shall Christ Iesus the true morning star, shewe himselfe at the time appointed of his father, to iudge both the quicke and the dead. And when thou hearest the crowing of the cocke, the sounding of belles, or anie other noise whatsoeuer, think alwaies, that thou hearest the trumpe of the Archangell sound, saying, arise you dead,

and come vnto iudgement. When thou awakest out of sléepe, praie to this effect as followeth.

all dangers of bodie & soule, and for all thy other benefites which thou hast plentifullie bestowed vppon me. And I pray thée, good father, to pardon and forgiue me all my sinnes and wickednes wherin I haue offended thy diuine maiestie, either this day, or anie day of my life here tofore, euen to this present houre. And receiue mee this night into thy tuition and protection, that my enimies may haue no power ouer

my heart, prostrate my selfe before the footestoole of thy blessed maiestie, acknowledging and confessing, that I am a most grieuous sinner, begot, conceyued, and borne in sinne, and liuing in all corruption and iniquitie, so that in me there is no goodnesse: yea, my whole nature is so corr

as insufficient to purchase thy fauor, I come vnto thée in the name of thy beloued son Iesus Christ (who is made vnto vs, holinesse, righteousnesse, santification, and redemption) most humblie beseeching thee for his precious bloud shedding, and for his bitter death and passion, to haue mercy vpon me, pardon and forgiue me all my sinnes and wickednes, both original & actuall, of thoughts, words, workes and déedes, of presumption,

of frailtie, of ignorance, and of knowledge, or how soeuer els committed against thy souereigne maiestie, euer since I was born. Good father blot them out of thy remembrance, hide them in the bloudie wundes of thy sonne, wash them away in the streames of his bloud. Accept his holinesse for my holinesse, his righteousnesse for my righteousnesse, and his precious bloud as a full recampence, satisfaction and

propitiation for al my sinnes. And as I craue pardon for al my sinnes past; so I beséech thee, for thy great mercies sake in Iesus Christ, giue me grace, power and strength, to resist sinne hereafter, with al occasions, meanes, wayes, and allurements leading therevnto. And because (oh Lord) without faith nothing can please thée, giue me, I beséech thée, a true, perfect and a iustifying faith, without the which no man shall sée thy

blessed face. Strengthen this faith in mee for euer to the end, & in the end, grāt me thy holie spirit trulie to repent, and most heartilie to sorrow for the multitude and heynousnesse of my transgressions. Worke in me also (good father) an inwarde hatred, lothing, and detestation vnto sume, that I walking before thée with vprightnes of hart, may after the dissolution of this my earthlie tabernacle, inherit eternall glorie in the

heauens, thorow the merits of thy sonne Christ Iesus,

lost, and to call sinners to repentance, to giue life to the faithfull, and to be a mediatour betweene God and man.

of our bodies and soules. And strengthen all thy seruants which in anie place are persecuted, imprisoned, condemned, and dailie put to death, for ye sincere profession of the same, and for the testimonie of a good conscience. Be mercifull vnto them, O Lord, and although they séeme destitute of all mans ayde, or worldly comfort, yet let thy swéete comfort and grace neuer depart from them, O Lord let no further triall be laid vpon

them, then they may be made able by thee to beare. And as thou hast by the power of thy might, not onlie vanquished and ouercome all corporall and bodilie enemi

patience, good Lord, to beare thy crosse thankfullie, with strength to go thorow, and to perseuere to the end, euen to the effusion of their bloud, knowing that they who denie thée before men, thou wilt denie them before thy heauenlie father, and his holie Angels in heauen. And for that there is no true wisdom whereof thou art not the authour, inspire their hearts with the spirite of true wisedom, knowledge, and vnderstanding

that they may know thy will aright, and that they may bee able by the same spirite to confound, and ouerthrow all the enimies of thy truth. Grant this swéets Iesus for thy holie names sake.

Wherefore good Lorde, vouchsafe to send downe thy holie spirite, euen the spirite of wisedome which waiteth vpon thy throne, into my heart, that I may know and vnderstand what things are good and acceptable before

thée, that I may attaine euerlasting life, thorow the merits of thy sonne his most bitter death & passion.

                        OH lord our God, in whose handes standeth the life and death of all mankind, vouchsafe I beséech thée, for thy sonne Christ his sake, to make me mindefull and readie to depart out of

this miserable and transitory life. And al though my bodie doth creep here vpon ye earth, yet let my conuersation bee alwaies in heauen, from whence we looke for a sauiour euen Iesus Christ the righteous, who shall chaunge our vile bodies, and make them like to his glorious bodie, by the mightie power whereby he is able to subdue all things to himselfe. Teach me, good Lord to know, that wee are al here strangers & pilgrims,

and haue in this worlde no dwelling place, but looke for one to come: in regarde whereof, giue me grace, I be séech thee, willinglie to forsake this wicked worlde, with all the vanities therof, & to hunger & thirst after that life, which neuer shall decay. Make me good Lorde to estéeme all things in this worlds as dongue, that I may winne Iesus Christ. And for that yt remembrance of death terrifieth vs from

sin, as thy seruant Salomon beareth record, giue mee grace I most humblie intreat thée, alwaies to remember and beare in mind, that I am mortall, and therefore must once of necessitie depart hence, either to euerlasting glorie, or else to euerlasting paines and confusion both of bodie and soule. Oh Lord assist mee with thy holie spirit, that I male so liue in this present euill world, as I may not feare either, but whensoeuer

he approcheth, I may with bolde confidence, crie out & say, Oh Death where is thy sting? oh Hell where is thy victory? Grant this, O Lorde my God, for Iesus Christ thy onelie begotten sonne his sake,
                     Amen.

Wherfore (most holy father) I render al praise and thanks to thee, from the bottom of my heart, generallie for all thy benefites and blessings, for all thy great mercies, and louing kindnesse shewed towards me in Iesus Christ, and particularly for that it hath pleased thée to

elect and chuse mee in Christ Iesus to euerlasting saluation, before the foundations of the world were layde, for creating me after thine owne similitude and likenesse, for redéeming of me by the death and passion of thy owne Son Iesus Christ, when I was

Lord, for feeding, nourishing, clothing and sustaining my bodie euer since I was born, for defending of me from infinite perils and daungers, yea from infinite deathes, which at diuerse times, and in sundrie places haue laine in waite for me, and threatned my destruction, and into which I had certainlie fallen, had I not béene by thy gracious goodnes supported, protected & defended. Last of all, I thanke thee, good Lord,

and I prayse thée, for thy swéete promises of euerlasting saluation, made vnto mee in Iesus Christ. For these and all other thy most gracious, benefites and blessings, (oh most glorious Father) I prayse thée, moste humblie beséeching thée for Iesus Christ thy sonne his sake, to pardon and forgiue mee my great vnthankefulnesse, ingratitude, and vnkindnesse towards thee, and from hencefoorth giue mee

thy holy grace, that I may procéede from thankfulnesse to thankfulnesse, from gratitude to gratitude, and from kindnesse to kindnesse towards thée, that I be neuer accounted amongst the number of those ix. vnthankefull leapers, who being cleansed from their leprosie, returned not againe to giue thée thanks. Graunt these my petitions vnto me, oh most benigne father, with all other good thinges which thou

knowest to be necessarie for me, better then I can either wish or desire, euen for the glorie of thy great name, for the truth of thy promises, and for Iesus Christ thy Sonne his sake my onelie Lorde, Sauiour, Kedéemer, Mediatour, and Aduocate, to whome with thy blessed Maiestie, and the holie Spirite, one true and euerlasting GOD, bee all honour, glorie, prayse, dominion,
