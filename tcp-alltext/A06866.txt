But they saye, whyst, not a word
vnles we be suspecte to be fellowes

Na by saynt Mary say they, al thīg

maye lyue in reste. O Lorde haue
marcy vpon vs. By thys meanes is
it come to passe, that vertue is so lytyll
regarded, & vice so vniuersallye
vsed. Wo be to those prestes, whiche
neglecte theyr office, flatter the people
& suffer them to lyue in al wyckednes.
For they are the Authors of all
euell. They are the occasion that so
many soules perysh. They cause y• so
much myschyfe & abhominacion reygneth
now a dayes. Theyr negligence,
ther silēce, theyr dissolute lyuing

cause, y• Gods worde is so euyll regarded
among many, and y• so great
wyckednes suppresseth y• honour of
the christen religion. Is it ony maruell?
We se that y• bodye wythereth
awaye, perysheth and decayeth, if it
wanteth corporal sustenaunce. Is it
thā to be thought y• the soule cā be in
salue estate, if it wāteth her meat, I
mene y• word of God?Matth. iiii. Christ sayth,
Man shall not lyue wyth breade alone,
but wyth euery worde,Deut. viii. that cō

of Gods worde fayleth, than
perysh the people & come to nought.
We fynd thys true euery daye more
& more. For the longer we lyue, the
more wyckednes do we se reygne.
            It pytyeth a Christen mannes hert
to beholde y• face of thys worlde.
            What vngodlynes, supersticion, Hypocrisye,
dissimulacion, swearynge,

pryde, enuye, dronkenshyp, glotony,
fornicacion, adulterye, whoredome,
couetousnes, & an whole sea of euelles
hath ouerflowed the world? And
all this is come to passe thorow the
sleapye negligence of Curates, nether
can ther as yet be perceuedony
amendment. The Prestes go forthe
styl to neglecte y• office of preaching
Gods worde, and y• people remayne
styll in theyr old blyndenes, not carynge
much though they neuer heare
one word of the holye Scripture
preached vnto them in al theyr lyfe,

But aboue al thynges, as Christe &

othes, let vs charitably monishe
the offēder, exhorte hym to cease frō
hys swerynge, and moue hym vnto
y• prayle of God and of hys moste holy

were no mo synnes committedde in

theyr soules withe the multitude of
synnes (for what so euer the sweard

dissembleth with another, and they
deale wt no trueth, They haue practised

haue taken great paynes to do myschefe.

They haue set theyr stoole in
the myddest of deceate, and for very

knowe the Lord. Theyr tonges are
like sharpe arowes to speake deceat.
Wyth theyr mouth they speake peasably

wherwyth they are woūded
inwardely & slayne, that is to saye,

full manerly bowed theyr knees,

by that meanes that they haue the

it ony maruell therfore thoughe we

Wyth what forhead may we be bold

whose honour we haue so oft defaced
 wt our vayne & ydle swearyng? Vndoubtedly
these swearers and blasphemers
of the name of God are in
a farre worse case,The world and gods word iudgeth diuersly of swearers. than they appere
before the worlde. The world by the
reason of the longe custome & continuaunce
therof, thyncke it no synne
ydelly to swear, nether doth it iudge
them that are swerers to be in onye
worse case, than the other sorte be,
but the worde of God iudgeth other
wyse of them. Gods word declareth
them to be the moost greuous enemies
of god, of his moost blyssed name,
of Iesus Christ his sonne, and of his
moost bytter passion. Gods word vttereth
them to be the chyldrenne of
wrath, fyre brondes of hell, captiues
of Satan, and ryght heyres of eternall
dānacion. Gods worde sheweth
manifestly, y• they haue in no parte y•
celestial heritage, but are already iudged

to hel syre, if they do not in thys
lyfe repente, bewayle theyr wretchednes,
confesse theyr abhominaciō
desyre marcy, and beleue faythfully
to haue forgyuenes. For heauē and
earth shall passe awaye, but y• worde

            This thret of god is not to be laughed
at. For if there be a God, as I am
certenly ꝑsuaded ther is, I am sure
that these abhominable Swearers
shall not escape vnponysshed, let thē
esteme theyr synne as lyght & as lytle
as they lyst, yea I am sure, ye vengeaunce
of God hangeth ouer theyr
heades, wher so euer they be. And although
God take the not vengeaūce
on them streyght wayes, yet am I

sure that they shall not escape, if in
this worlde, yet not in the worlde to
come,Ps. exliiii so righteous a Iudge is God,
so faythefull is he in all his wordes.
Howe can it otherwyse be? We se by
dayly experience that if ony manne
blasphemeth an earthly Prynce,Gen. iii or
speak
                  •
                euell of his name, he dyeth y•
death streyghtwayes without mercy.
If such honour and reuerence be
gyuē vnto a worldly Prynce, which
is earth, & vnto earth shall returne
agē, what is thā to be thought of thē
which blaspheme y• name of ye moost
hygh & celestial kyng, which is kyng
of all kynges. and Lorde of all Lordes?
The blasphemy done to a mortall
man is ponyshed with swearde,
and shall the blasphemy done to god
escape, thyncke you, wyth a fylyppe
in the forhead, or with the knocke of
a lytyll woden betyll: as it beganne
in certen monnes houses to be ponyshed

nowe of late? Na verely. It is
no fylyp matter, excepte ye wyll admyt
suche a fylyppe, as shal fylyppe
them downe into the botome of hell

It is not a fylippe, that can wype awaye
y• blasphemy of his moost blissed
name before his hyghe throne &
glorioꝰ maiestye. Wo be to thē y• syn,
and kepe not my comaundementes,
sayth the Lorde, for I wyll not surely
spare them.iiii. Es. xv In the olde lawe God
gaue this cōmaūdement for the blasphemers
of his name. Who so euer
curseth his god,Le. xxiiii sayth he, shall beare
his synne. And he that blasphemeth
the name of the Lorde, he shall dye
for it. All the multitude shall stonne
hym to deathe. Whyther he be Citizyn
or straunger, if he blasphemethe
the name of the Lord, let hym dye y•
deathe. What wyll the blasphemers
of God saye to thys precepte? Do

they thynke that God is a sleape, so
that nowe he careth not for the glory
of his name? Na let them be sure.
GOD tendereth nowe his glory so
much as euer he dyd, and abhorreth
wyckednes now no lesse thā he hath
done euer heretofore. He is a ielous
god, & wyl not suffer thē to escape vnponysshed,
that pollute & defyse his
moost glorious name.In math. S. Austē sayeth,
they synne no lesse, whiche blaspheme
Christ reygnyng in heauen,
than they, which crucifyed hym wal
kyng in earth.In qecalogum. A certen wryter also
in the Hebrue tong called Rabbi Aben
Ezra writethe on this manner:
Certes this is the custome in Egipt
euen vnto this daye, that if ony mā
doth sweare by the head of the kyng
and dothe not fulfyll his sayenge, he
shall be the chylde of deathe. If that
he woulde offer for hys raunsome a
great sūme of golde, yet shall he not
lyue, seing he hath despised the kyng

openly. If a kynge doth so, which is
flesh and bloud, whose begynnyng &
ende is vanite, and whose kyngdom
is vanite, much more, yea a thousād
tymes more ought a man to take hede,
yt he offēd not God wt his tōg, y• he
doth not so order his mouth, y• he maketh
his flessh to synne by remēbryng
God in vayne. Agē he sayth, ther are
many, which thinke it no great offēce
if a mā taketh y• name of god in vayne.Ibidem
                     •
                  
               
But I wyll shewe thē, y• it is greter
& more greuous thā y• brekyng of
al y• cōmaūdemētes yt follow. For he
y• is a māsleare or an adulterer, whiche
surely are great offēses, he cā not
slea nor play y• whoremonger at al times,
for he is in feare. But he that
hath accustomed him selfe vnto vayne
oothes, he cōmitteth in one day in
numerable othes, & he is so greatly in
vse wt thys fault, that he perceaueth
it not, whan he swereth. And if thou
rebukest hym & sayst, wherfore haste

thou nowe so sworne? He streyghtwayes
sweareth that he sware not,
yea and that for the to muche vse of
sweryng. For such before they bring
forth ony worde, they sweare fyrste,
thynkyng that it garnyseth theyr
communicacion very pleasauntely
so to sweare. But if there were in
Israel no more faultes, but this one
alone, it were ynoughe to prolonge
our captiuite, and cause y• we shulde
be plaged euery daye more & more.
These are the wordes of the Hebrue
Interpretoure, wherof we maye learne
howe great an offēce it is vaynly
to sweare, and howe it heapeth vp
on vs the plages and vengeaunce of
God more then the breakyng of ony
other commaundement, except it be
for ydolatry, whiche synne thys also
matcheth. But let vs returne to the
scriptures of God.

Here maye they se, that the terrible
curse of God is come abroade for all
Theues and sweares, so that it shall
faull vpon theyr house, and consume

it wyth all that euer pertayne vnto
it. Here maye they learne, that they
iudgement is at hand, that theyr dā
               nacion
can not be exchewed, except
                  •
               
they shortly repent, beleue & amend.
For the boke of curses slieth abrode.
It is no lenger kept in secret, and it
shall vndoubtedly faull on the houses
of so many as vaynely sweare.
God can no lenger abyde this abhominacion,
it is so great, and grown

                  om. xv as the nature
of an ooth doth. A sweard sleath not
so cruelly, as the plage of an oothe
doth. For a swearer, although he semeth
to lyue, yet is he dead already
and hath receued hys deadly woūd.
And as he that taketh an halter before
he goeth out of the Citie, and cō
               meth

hath the Hangman followyng him,
is dead, so soone as he goethe oute of
the place of iudgement, so lykewyse
is he that is a swearer. The oothe is
not so soone come out of the mouth,
but that the swearer is condemned
streyghtwayes vnto eternall damnacion.
            What wyll these blasphemers of
Gods moost holy name saye to this
golden mouthed Doctore, which cō
               parethe
all swearers to theues,Sweares are lyke theues cond

sayth that they are like vnto a these
that is condemned vnto death, and
wereth his halter redy to be hāged?
Are not these swearers come nowe
vnto a fayre promocion? They be
lyke theues cōdemned to dye, sayth
the holy Doctore Chrisostome. The
Iudge hathe gyuen sentence. They
be condemned. So that althoughe
they be yet fre from y• playes of goddes
vengeaunce, as the these is before

he commeth vnto the gallowes,
yet they maye be as sure not to escape
them, as though they were nowe
already in theyr neckes. And the longer
theyr punyshment is differed,
the more greuous shall it be, whan
it cōmeth. Many, I graunt, in this
worlde are not ponysshed for theyr
great abhominable swearynge, yet
haue there not wanted examples in
our tyme, which haue aboundantly
declared, howe greatly the synne of

in theyr mouthes that by no means
they could suffer to haue them speared.
Theyr tōge & all that euer was

tokens of Gods wrath and vengeaunce
for takynge his holy name
in vayne? Woulde God they y• were
thus punyshed, myght be an example
vnto vs for to leaue the wycked

If we wyll not cease, but styll prouoke
god vnto anger, surely we shal
proue & feale those same plages, and

nor by Hierusalem, for it is the citis

swear by thy head, because thou art
not able to make one heare whyght
or blacke. But let your communicaciō
               
be yea, yea, naye, naye. For what
so euer is more than that, cometh of
euell. Herevnto agreeth S. Iames

If it be not lawfull for vs to sweare

it not lawful for vs to swear by him

it nedes be damnable to sweare by y•

and to magnify the moost glorious

punishment ordined for it at all. We
blaspheme ye name of god, as though

                  e signifyeth
it is so fresh & vnsauery. Yea wolde
God these abhominable blaspemers
of Gods moost holy name, were not
extreme enemies to gods worde, chosyng

rather to remayne dastardes
styll in the folyshnesse of the worlde,Swearers are enemyes to gods word
than to become wyse and prudēt in
the wysdome of gods worde. All swerers
therfore are enemies bothe to
god and hys worde. A Christen man
maye not acquaynte hymselfe wyth
such māners, nor so wyckedly abuse
hys tonge. For oure tonge is gyuen
vs, not that we shoulde sweare, lye,
blaspheme, ieste, rayle, scoffe, mocke,
& vse vngodly talke, but y• we shulde
onely speake those thynges, whiche
maye bothe turne vnto the glory of
god, & the health of our neyghbour.
And thys is it that S. Paule sayth
let your speach be wel fauoured and
poudered wyth salte.Colos. iiii. Our speche is
well sauoured, semely, honest & comely,
whan there appeare the no thing

honeste. It is poudered wyth salte,
whē it vttreth those thynges, which
are godly, wyse, and edifye so many
as are the hearers of it. Let all swerers
marke this, and amende theyr
cōmunicacion, vnlesse they be that
vnsauery salte,Math. v whiche shall be caste
out and troden vnder foote.

maye haue fauour with the hearers
If no fylthy communicacion ought

lesse ought ony vayn dothes, vngodly
swearynges, blasphemies. &c.
come forth out of them. If our wordes
ought to be good to edify wythe
all, thā ought they not to be such as
should destroy both our selues & the
hearers, which many tymes chaunseth
thorow wicked oothes. Let not

dome,Ephe. v sayth he, and all vnclennes or
couetousnes, or fylthynes, or folyshe
talkynge, or iestynge be once named
among you, as it becommeth saynctes,
but rather thanckes gyuyng.
            If these thynges maye not once be
named among vs, surely much lesse,
yea a M. tymes muche lesse oughte
oothes, swearynges & blasphemies
of Gods moost holy name be named
among vs and hearde in our dayely
speache. If the wrath & vengeaunce
of God be wonte to faull vpon the
chyldren of vnbeleue for these thynges
aforesayd, as S. Paule testifyeth,
certenly let all swearers be certenlye
assured that they shall not escape
the plages of Gods vengeasice,
and theyr damnacion shal be y• more
greuous, for asmuch as they professe

mynded vnto all good workes,

to be plaged with fyre & brymestone,
but also to suffer all other kyndes of
intollerable paynes, yea and that in
hell, where is no redemcion nor marcy
to be had. The Lorde,Psal. xi sayth Dauid,
seeth both the ryghteous & vngodly,
but who so delyghteth in wickednes,
him his soule abhorreth. Vpon

threatenyng. If men wyl not turne
he hath whet his swearde, he hathe
bent his bowe, and made it redy. He
hath prepared hym the weapons of

                And they that found
him gatheryng styckes brought him
vnto Moses and Aaron & vnto all
the congregacion, & they put him inward.
For it was not declared, what
shoulde be done vnto hym. And the
Lorde sayd vnto Moses, the manne
shall dye. Let al the multitude stone
hym with stones without the hoost.
And all the multitude brought hym
wythout the hoost, & stoned hym wt
stones and he dyed, as the Lorde cō
               maunded
Moses. If the man that
gathered styckes vpon the Saboth

whiche notwythstondynge
was but a ceremoniall law seruyng

but for a tyme, and a figure of oure
spirituall quietnes and reast, which
we ought to haue cōtinually in our

also is nowe abolyshed, & stond
in none effect (so that we are Lordes
of the Sabothe daye, and maye appoynte

we may the more cōueniently come

commaundement of God for transgressynge
that precepte, howe maye
these swearers than persuade themselues

theyr couetous affeccion, and labour
to satisfy that, they neglecte &

What for all that? Yet by this

            And whan they dye, they shall leaue

O miserable wretches, whyche

wyll putte hys soule in daunger:Mark wel To

gotten, whiche he hathe leafte vnto
hys sonne, whan his soule lyghethe

y• father is a wretch & hath nothyng.
The sonne is replenyshedde withe

greuous paynes and ītollerable tormentes.
The sonne syngeth, playeth
daunceth and maketh mery, the father

weapeth lamenteth, soroweth,
and wysheth hymselfe neuer to haue
ben borne.Fidem spectato Beholde what is the ende
of euell gotten goodes. Behold how
Dame Periury rewardethe her seruauntes
at the latter ende. Behold
vnto what poynt falshode bryngeth
them, that vse it. Why do not mē
remember these thynges, & laboure
to lyue iustly, ryghteously & of theyr
owne? Godlynesse is great ritches,
sayth S. Paule,i. Ti. vi if a man be cōtent
with that he hath. Oh that mē wold
once be wyse, and remember theyr
latter ende. So would they not hūt
about to get the goodes of this wretched
world by hooke or by crooke, as
they do now a dayes, but rather lay
vp treasures for them selues in heauē,
where nether rust nor moulthes
corrupte,Mat. vi and where theues nether
breke vp nor steale. Treasures that
are wickedly gotten profyt nothing

but ryghteousnes delyuereth from

those men thynke, which so gredely
gather togyther the goodes of
the worlde, yea & that vnryghteously,
that those possessions can longe
endure in theyr stocke, kynred & lynage.
For we haue both hearde and
sene, that goodes wrongfully gottē
be soone dispersed abrode & come to
nought. Is not this a common sayeng
among vs: Euel gotten goodes
wyl neuer cōe to good profe. Agayn,
the goodes, whiche are wrongefully
gotten, the thyrde heyre shall scasely
enioye. The Latinistes also saye,
Male partum peius perit. A thyng that is
euell gotten, neuer thryueth, but y•
spendyng of it is worse, thā the gettynge
was. The Poet Claudianus
haue very godly verses pertaynyng
vnto this our matter, which I wyll
here nowe reherse.

that the father hathe offended. And
looke what rytches the tonge of the
deceatfull father hath gathered togyther,
euen the very same hath the
tonge of the sonne payde home agen
and wastfully spēt. The Greke Poet
Hesiodus also sayth,Hesiodus that that mā
whiche wrongly testifieth and falsly
forsweareth hymselfe, doth not only
hurte Iustice, but he himselfe also is
so hurte, that he can neuer be healed

falsely to forsweare hym self for a litle
dungelyke mucke, seyng that by
this means he shal not only prouoke
Goddes wrath vnto hym selfe, condemne

that it is better not to fufyll the
vowes of a folysh promyse, than by
the obseruaunce of them to commit
ony wyckednes. That oth, promyse
or vowe therfore, which displeaseth

God,Mark wel repugnethe the diuine verite,
fyght agaynst the Lordes word, prouoketh
vnto synne, condemneth the
conscience of the keper, and can not
be performed wythoute wyckednes,

kepte, but reiecte as a thyng muche
daungerous and hurtefull bothe to

for a burnt offeryng. At his returne
it fortuned that his doughter being
his only chylde came out agenst him
wythe tymberelles and daunces.
            Whan he sawe her, he was much amased
and greatly sorowful because
of his vow, that he had made to god

Notwythstondyng he sayde,God desyreth thanckes gyuyng and not bloudy sacrifices I haue

For it is the sacrifice of prayse

rather wylleth, that they shuld lyue

the Psalmograph sayth, heare, o my
people, let me speake, let me testifye
among you, O Israel: I am god, yea
I am euen thy God. I wyll not reproue
the bycause of thy sacrifices,
thy burnte offerynges are alway in

& all that therin is. Thynkest thou,
that I wyll eate the flesh of oxen, or

vnto god the sacrifice of prayse, and
pay thy vowes vnto the moost highest.
And call vpon me in the tyme of
trouble, so wyll I heare the, that yu
shalte thāke me. The Psalmograph

hymselfe also sayth,Psal.

and not the kyllyng and offryng vp
of our chyldren, or the performynge
of such folysh & wicked vowes which
cā not be performed wythout synne
and vngodlines.
            Herode also made a promyse to the
doughter of Herodias, whā she daū
               ced
& salyed so plesantly before hym
and hys Lordes at a certayne banket,
that he wolde gyue her, what so
euer she wold aske euen vnto y• halfe
of hys kyngdome. She by the councell
of her wycked mother asked the
head of Iohn̄ Baptiste. So that the
kynge, because he wold not go backe
of his worde, suffered the holy Prophet
of God to be slayne, & no cause

why, but only y• he thought it wolde
not stonde with his honour & royall
dignite to breake his promyse. Ah folysh
vowe and more folysh kyng. Ah
wycked promyse and more wycked

               e to all
those vowes and promises, whyche
are not fulfilled without synne and
wyckednes.
            Agen we rede in thactes of thapostles,
that there were mo than forty
men, which had conspired agenst
Paule,Act. xxiii and made a solemne vow, an
earnest promyse, and a foule deuout
ooth, that they woulde neyther eate
nor dryncke, vntyll they had slayn
                  •
               
Paule. For we are redy, saye they,
to kyll him, before he come nygh vnto

vs by a myle.A whotte zele in dede but not accordynge to knowledge Here was a whotte
brennyng zele. They thought euery
hour a thousād yere, tyl they might
mete with tholy Apostle, and shedde
his bloude, they were so lothe to be
founde double in theyr wordes, & so
sory that he shulde teache ony more

of theyr holye synagoge, and the vtter

               uout fathers
the Pharises, Scribes, Lawers, bishoppes,

elders of the people. &c. To preuent
these high inconueniences and
to suppresse y• great enormities newly
reysed vp by the meās of Paules
doctrine, ye wyll not easely beleue,
what paynes these good men toke.
They coulde not rest nether nyghte
nor daye. As for meate dryncke and
slepe was gone with them. B
                  •
                mery
at theyr hartes they could neuer vntyll

they had slayne Paule y• greate
Heretyke, that teacher of new learnyng,
that brynger in of new lawes
that destroyer of all the olde laudable
customes, that troubler of the cō
               mon
peace,Ioan. xvi. that sower of discorde, y•
peruertour of the holy olde religiō,
that enemy of all good deuocion, &c.
Therfore made they a solemne vow,
in good tyme might it be spokē, that
they woulde tast nothyng, no not so
much as a pore ale bery for y• cōforte
of theyr harte, vntyl they had slayn
Paule, in so muche that they were
gone so farre in dede, that they had
rather slea Paule, and cast theyr soules
into hell fyre for doyng that mischeuous
acte, than they would once
breake theyr vowe. For they iudged
by this meanes to do God an hyghe
sacrifice. Surely I thyncke that if
the porke of Rome had at that tyme

                  〈◊〉
                reygnyng, and in his full power

scaulled, they would scasely haue beleued
that he had ben able to dispēse
wyth theyr vow, it was so solem, feruent,
and spronge out of the harte
roote. Is it not to be thought, that
they were whot in theyr matters,
whā they coulde not kepe theyr mischeuous
pretence secrette,Dignū patella operculum. but came
vnto the chefe prestes and elders, as
couers worthy such cuppes, & gostly
fathers fyt for suche a confession,
and tolde them that they had boūde
them selues wyth a vowe, that they
myght eate nothyng vntyl the had

shulde haue dyed for

they fasted for so good a purpose? O
holy votories. I maruell howe they
could euer pacify theyr consciences
afterwarde, seynge they made so solemne
a vowe, and yet brake it. For
they neuer slue Paule, so myghty a

Lorde is God to defende his serualltes
from the cruell handes of bloudy
tyrauntes. But the holye religious
men are to be holdē excused, for

So y• before the worlde they were

sayeng of S. Ambrose, that Dauid
dyd not fulfyll hys ooth by the shed
dynge of bloude, it was the greater
godlynes. I se that Dauid beyng a
godly and holye man dyd faull into
rash swearyng, and yet that he had
rather not to do that he had sworne
than to fulfyll hys ooth by the shed
dyng of mannes bloud.In Hieremiam. S. Ierome
saythe, that an oothe ought to haue
thre compagniōs, trueth, iudgemet
& ryghteousnes.An oothe oughte to haue thre cōpagniōs Where these want,
saythe he, it is no oothe, but playne
periury. Therfore the ooth, promise
or vowe, that is not grounded on
trueth, iudgement, and ryghteousnes,
ought to be broken. It is groū
                  ded
on truethe, whan it is agreable
to Goddes worde, which is the selfe
trueth.Mark wel It is groūded on iudgemēt,
whan it is not rashely, folyshly and

wyth hygh prudence and great deliberacion.

                     •
                   it, neyther vnto oure selues
nor vnto our neyghbours. Al othes
and promises thus taken and made
ought to be obserued & kepte, but otherwyse
to be broken, refused and
caste awaye without ony scruple of
conscience or veracion & trouble of
mynde. For this sentence of the preacher
abydethe alwaye true.Eccl. v. An vnfaythful
and folysh promyse displeaseth
God.
            Thus perceaue we, what oothes,
promises or vowes oughte to be obserued,
and whiche they are y• shulde
be reiected. So that all godly othes
and promises ought to be obserued.
They that do not laboure to fulfyll
them, forsweare them selues, & shall
not escape the plage of periury.

wherin they saye, they are not only
suffered frely to sweare, but also cō
               maunded
so to do, I answer: Whan
euell thynges began to encrease in

the worlde,Hom. xxvi as Chrisostome writeth,
whan there was a confusion made
in euery place, and no order, whan
men fell vnto the seruyse & worshyppynge
of Idolles, whanne all sayth
was loste, and all vnfaythefulnesse
reygned, than began the Infidelles,
seyng that one wolde not trust and
beleue another in matters of cōtrauersy,
to call vpon theyr Goddes for
wytnesses, protestynge therby that
they spake truth, forasmuch as they
called theyr Gods to wytnes in the
matter, (whome to name they thought
it not lawful but in serious, earnest,
graue, weyghty and necessary
matters) and by this means obtayned
they fayth one of another. Now
for asmuche as God had selected the
Israelites from the Gentiles to be
his people,Ho
                     •••
                   xxvii and would by no means
that they shoulde in ony poynte followe
theyr wyckednes, vnlesse therby

they shoulde be allured from the
true worshyp of god vnto Idolatry,Why god suffered y• Iewes to sweare by hym
he gaue a commaundement to thē,
y• in all matters of controuersy, and
in suche affayres as shuld make vnto
his glory, and the health of theyr
brothers, they shulde not call ony of
those false Goddes, whome the Ethnyckes
worshypped, vnto wytnesse,
nor sweare by theyr names, but call
hym a wytnesse, and sweare by hys
name, & so euery one to beleue another
for the reuerence and honoure
that they owe to his moost holy and
blyssed name.
            What is this to y• purpose? what
refuge can these abhominable swearers
haue here? Thys commaundemēt
only serueth for graue, weyghty,
serious & ernest matters, & they abuse
it to cloke & couer theyr wycked
& abhominable custom of swearing.
Is this allowable before God? wyll

               
               
this go for good paymēt? No surely,
GOD wyll not thus be mocked.
            God wyll not suffer his moost glorious
name so wickedly to be abused.
God wyll not abyde that hys worshyp,
honoure, renowme, glorye and
magnificēs shuld so be obscured, defaced
& blotted. God is a ielous God, &
he canne not abyde that he shulde be
dishonoured by ony meanes. I am y•
Lorde, sayth he, this is my name. I
wyll gyue my glorye to none other.
Here therfore haue these swearers
no refuge, but styll runne hedlongs
into euerlastyng damnacion.
            Another company,Esa. xiii that vse swearyng,
say, we thynke no harme, whā
we sweare, and therfore can it be no
great faulte. I answere. Yet are ye
not so fauteles nor excused. For the
scripture sayth, that we shall gyue a
streyght count at the dredefull daye
of iudgemente for euery ydle worde

that we speake. What is than to be
thought of our idle & vayne oothes?
I praye you? Shal we not gyue an
accountes of them? Yies we may be
sure, & also condemned for them, if
we do not repent, beleue and amend
Agayne. Of thy wordes shalte thou
be iustified, and of thy wordes shalt
thou be condemned. Howe gothe it
thā with our oothes?Sap. i In what case
stond they? The scripture sayth, the
mouth that lyeth, slayeth the soule.
Do not vayne oothes so in lyke mā
               ner.
            And where as it is sayd, we thinke
no harme. I answere, the scripture
sayth:Math. xii Luke. vi Of thabundans of the harte,
the mouth speaketh. A good mā out
of the good tresure of his harte, bringeth
forth good thīges. And an euel
man out of the euyll treasure of his
harte bryngeth forth euyl thynges.
What wyll we saye to thys? Are we

not here playnely condemned?
            Another sorte excuse them selfes
& saye, fewe or none wyll beleue vs,
excepte we sweare. To thys answereth
Chrysostome on this manner:
An ooth maketh not a man worthy
to be beleued,Hom. vii but y• testimony of his
lyfe, the integrite & purenes of hys
conuersacion, & a good mynde. For
many oftentymes haue sworne and
entangled themselues greatly, and
yet haue they not made men to beleue
them Other haue only made as
it were but a becke, and haue appered
moche more worthye to be beleued,
thā they which haue so greatly
sworne.
            These wordes declare manifestly
that swearyng among faythful and
honest men neadeth not, and for thē
that are vnfaythful & regarde no honeste,
surely all the othes in y• world
wyll not make them to be beleued of

them that are vertuous & godly disposed.
Therfore this can be none excuse
for these swearers. Among the
faythful, oothes nede not, & among
the vnfaithful, they profit not.Dothes amōg y• faithfull nede not, amōg y• vnfaithful they profyt not For
he that beleueth not a man without
an oothe, nether wyl he beleue hym,
though he sweareth neuer so moche.
But alas for pytie, that euer faythe
shulde be so decayed among Christē
men, that one wyll not beleue another,

It is hygh tyme for the worlde to be
at an ende,Luke. xviii whan one man truste the
not another. Do ye thyncke, saythe
Christ, that the sonne of man shall
fynde ony fayth on the earth, whan
he shall come?
            Thus sewe that al excuses, which
are inuented to mayntayne y• dyuellysh
custome of swering, are nothing

worthe. Oure damnacion abydethe
styll. The heate of Gods vengeaūce
towarde vs is nothyng abated. So
that if we wyll be saued, there is no
remedy but to leaue our wicked sweryng,Exo. x

to reuerēce the name of God,
and thanckefully to vse his creatures,

Thou shalt not take the name
of thy Lorde God in vayne.
For the Lorde wyll not
holde hym gyltelesse / that rakethe
hys name in vayne.
            
            Also the sayeng of Christ,Math. v swear not
at all, nether by heauen, for it is the
throne of God, nether by earthe, for
it is the foote stoole of hys feete, nether
by Ierusalem, for it is the citie
of the great Kynge, nor yet by thy
head shalte thou sweare, for yu canste
not make one heare nether whyghte,

nor blacke. But your communicacion
shall be, yea, yea, naye, naye. For
that is more than thys, commeth of

the word of God. We are not forbydden

falsely & vnryghteously to sweare.

all our othes is moost of al to be looked

to desyre ony thynge, excepte it makethe
vnto the glorye of God, mochelesse
ought we to swere for it. I wyll
make this matter more euident and
playne by familiare examples.
            If a Christen man were amonge
the Iewes,Example for the glory of god Turkes, Saracens or
ony other Infidelles, preaching the
word of God purely vnto them, and
earnestly labouryng to turne them
from theyr Idolatrye vnto the true

God, whom he preached vnto them,
that all is truthe that he preacheth,
he may lawfully in this poynt take
the name of God vnto wytnesse, and
sweare that it is truthe that he precheth.
For thys oothe thus taken &
beleued, turneth both vnto the glory
of God, and also vnto the health
                  •
               
of many soules and therfore is it not
vayne and idle, but righteous & godly.
On this manner dyd God the father
hym selfe in the olde Testamēt,
the Patriaches and Prophetes, in
the newe Testament Christ and hys
Apostles sweare, and after this mā
               ner
maye all the sayntes and faythfull
of God sweare. He that perceaueth,Serm. i. de verbis do mini

do not vse it, except it be in necessite,
whan he seeth that men are slow to

beleue that, whiche is profitable for
them to beleue, excepte it be confirmed
wyth an oothe.
            Agayne,Example for y• helth of our neighboure if it dyd so chaunse that
two Christē men were at debate for
some matter that is in controuersy
betwene them, and the thyrde dyd
knowe that the one dydde the other
playne iniury, and wrought agenst
hym contrary vnto the rule of equite
and iustice, and so made declaracion
therof vnto y• Iudge. The Iudge
in this behalf may lawfully require
an oothe of that wythnes bearer, &
he that so testifyeth maye wt a ryght
& good conscience sweare in thys behalfe.
And thys hys oothe is bothe
ryghteous and godly. For by that
is peace, amite, concorde & Christen
charite brought agayne betwene thē
that were at debate, and the worke

that Christen men redyng the

be ashamed of theyr wyckednes. His

But for mony looke thou swearest

not to be called forthe to sweare for
euery lyght trifle, nor yet to sweare
as many do, they can not tell what
nor wherfore. The to muche customable
vse of sweryng, hath brought
it so to passe, that as many care but
lytyl to sweare, so forse they not moche
to forswear thē selfes. The cause
for the whiche menne shulde sweare,
ought not onely to be good, but also
necessary, and so opēly proued vnto
them, before they be broughte vnto
theyr oothe. Thys shulde make men
to haue the name of God in y• hygher
reuerence, to take an ooth wythe
the godlyer mynde, and to haue the
office of the head rulars in y• greater

estimacion. For to make mē sweare
by compulsiō, before they knowe the
matter, whyther it be good, lawful,
godlye, necessarye or otherwyse,
lette other menne iudge, that be better
learnedde than I, whyther it be
agreable to the worde of GOD or
not. But thys dare I be bolde to
saye, that an oothe can not be taken
wythe to moche reuerence & aduisemente,
in asmuche as by it, God is
called vpon to be a wytnesse in that
behalfe. Therfore ought men not to
be compelled rashly to sweare, vnles
by that meanes they prouoke the vē
               geaunce
of God both agaynst them
selfes, and those also that cause them
so vnaduisedly for to sweare, but to
come vnto theyr oothe wythe great
sobriete and deliberacion.
            Thus lewe for what causes it is
lawfull for a Christē man to sweare,
what soeuer oothe cometh forth out

of our mouthe, if it be not for one of
these causes aforsayd, it is dānable &
playne synne. Therfore lette all men
take hede. Let no man from henseforthe
take the name of oure Lorde
God in vayne. for who so dothe, shal
not surely escape vnponyshed.
            Let the rulars of the comō weale
fynde some honest remedy,Magistrates that the
name of God be no more blasphemed
among theyr subiectes. Let thē consyder
howe loth they are, that they
them selfes shulde be euyll spoken of
and blasphemed. Lette them weygh
wyth them selues, howe moche God
excelleth them, & how farre hys dignite
dothe excede theyr dignite. If
ony man defacethe theyr renowme,
they are ponyshed streyghtwayes, &
not without a cause. But how chaū
               seth
it, that the Lorde of all Lordes
and Kyng of all Kynges is no more
feared? How cometh it to passe, that

hys moost holye & blyssed name is so
vniuersally blasphemed, yea & y• frely
and wythout punyshment? Were
it not, thyncke you, conueniēt, that
the ciuile magistrate shulde earnestly
prouide, that the name of GOD
myght haue hys due honour, and y•
it myghte no more be abused withe
abhominable & vnlawfull oothes in
theyr Realmes, but praysed & magnified,
seynge that by it we obtayne
all oure healthe and saluacion? God
by his holy spirite mought vouchesafe
to breathe into the hartes of all
Prynces, Kynges and rulars, that
whan they be godly assembled togyther
for matters cōcernyng the glory
of god & the publique weale, they
maye also entreate of thys thynge
in theyr Sinodes, Congregacions,
Parliamentes, councelles, &c. that
God maye be glorifyed, & hys moost

            These textes of the holy scripture
declare manifestly how feruent,The preachynge of Gods word causeth y• Christen religiō to floryshe busy,
studious and diligēt all true prestes
ought to be in the preachyng of
Gods worde. The men godly enspired
knewe ryght well, that so longe
as Goddes worde is preached to the
people, it must nedes go well wythe

the Christen religion, but if it once
cease, than farewell all godlynesse,
farewell all vertue and goodnes. Of
thys thynge, alas for pitie, haue we
hadde experience many a yere vnto
our great discomfort, and yet lytyll
redresse. For many of the prestes go
forth to be as sluggysh as euer they
were, neyther haue they ony godly
care for Christes flocke cōmitted vnto
thē. So they maye haue the profytes,
they care for no more. Bo nusest
odor lucriexre qualiber. So y• by thys
meanes the shepe are lyke to dye for
meate. But alas howe shoulde they
teach other, whan they them selues
knowe nothynge. They are euen as
the Prophet saythe,
                  
                     •
                  sa. lvi dumme dogges
not once being able to barke. Many
agayne of them there are, which are
learned, and knowe theyr duty, and
yet I knowe not wyth what spirite
moued they holde theyr peace, they

speake nothyng, they se theyr shepe
runne astraye before theyr faces,
walke in all kynde of wyckednes, &
yet haue they no pitie. I wonder wt 
what forheades these men wyll appere
before the hygh prest and great
Iudge Christ at the dredefull day of
iudgement. I pray God they be not
Epicures bothe in lyuyng & iudgement.
But let vs heare what the holy
and catholyke Doctors saye vnto
thys matter.
            S. Ierome sayth,In Leuit. Dist. xxxvi. Cā. Siquis. if ony mā wyll
be a Byshop not onely in name but
also in deseruynge, let hym followe
Moses, and let hym follow Aaron.
For what is sayd of them, that they
went not from the tabernacle of the
Lorde. Ergo Moses was continually
in the tabernacle of the Lorde.
What busynesse had he there? Verely
that ether he shulde lerne somewhat
of God, or els teache the people.

These are the two workes of a
Byshop,The work of a Bysshop is to study the holy scriptures, purely to preache thē vnto the people, and feruently to praye that he shulde learne of god
by readyng the diuine scriptures &
by hauyng hys continuall meditacion
in them, or elles teache the people,
but yet ought be to teache those
thynges, that he had learned of god,
and not of his owne harte or mans
wisdome, but those thynges that y•
holy Ghoste teacheth. There is another
worke also that Moses dothe,
he goeth not vnto y• warres, he fightethe
not agaynst the enemies, but
what doth he? He prayeth. And while
he prayethe, hys people ouercommeth,
if he do once slake & let downe
hys h
                  •
               des, thā are hys people ouercome
and chased away. Let y• preste
of the chyrche therfore praye wythout
ceasyng,Exo. xvii. that the people, whych
are vnder hym, may ouercome ther
inuisible enemies the Amalechites,
which are dyuels that do impugne

and fyghte agaynst them, that wyll
lyue godly in Christ.
            O howe true, swete and godly are
these wordes of the holye Doctore?Learn your dutye here o ye Prestes
Here may al Byshops & Prestes lern
what theyre dutye is, not to be idle,
not tohsit & hawk, not to dyse & card
not to bācket and lyue voluptuously,
not to playe the ruflyng galātes
and to be entangled wyth worldely
busynesses, but to be continually in
the tabernacle of the Lorde, that is
to saye, to studye and to haue theyr
perpetuall meditacion in the holye
scriptures euen both daye & nyght.
as Dauid saythe,Psal. i. and wyth all diligence
to teache the people committed
to theyr Spirituall charge, not
mennes tradicions, not theyr owne
fantasies, but Goddes moost holye
worde, euen the holy scriptures, and
suche thynges, wherof y• holy Ghost
is the Author. Lette them therfore

looke well to theyr office. For if they
be true Byshops and Prestes, thys
is the worke committed vnto them,
euen continually to studye the holy
scriptures, and purely to preach thē
vnto the people. If they leaue thys
office vndone, & do the worckes prescribed
of man, so do they shewe thē
selfes to be y• seruauntes not of god,
but of man. Let thē therfore looke,
what answer they wyll make to the
hygh Iudge and great preste Christ
at the terrible daye of iudgement.
            Moreouer it is theyr duty feruētly
and wythout ceasyng to pray for
the people, that they maye preuayle
agaynst Satā & hys ministers that
fyght dayly agaynst thē.The prayers of many prestes are colde 
                     •

                     •
                  yes How colde
y• prayers of many of thē are, I wyl
not now dispute. For they are more
open to the whole worlde, than they
nede here to be rehersed. Whā Moses
helde vp hys handes and prayed

hys people dyd ouercome. Whyther
our Prestes holde vp theyr handes
& praye, as they ought, let other mē
iudge. Of this am I sure, y• syns the
world begā, therneuer reigned more
synne and abhominaciō than there
doth at this daye, which is but a slē
               der
argument that we get the victory
of our enemies. God gyue al Byshoppes
and Prestes grace once to
looke vpon theyr office diligently, y•
they maye both earnestly studye the
holy scriptures, teache them syncerly
vnto the people, and continually
occupy thē sel
                  •
               esin feruent prayers.
Than shal it not only be wel wt Christes
flocke, but also with them selues
at the dredefull daye of iudgement,
whā they shall appere before y• hygh
Byshop Iesus Christ, and gyue accoūtes
vnto hym of theyr behauour
in the office that was cōmitted vnto
them in this worlde.
            
               
S. Austen also sayth,In Aggeū Prophetā
                cōsyder that
it is the office of prestes, whan they
be demaunded of y• lawe, to answer.
If he be a Preste, let hym knowe the
lawe of the Lord, if he knoweth not
the lawe of the Lorde, he declare the
euidently that is he is no preste. For
it pertayneth vnto ye Lordes preste
to know the law, and whan he is asked,
to make answer of ye lawe. Lord
be mercifull vnto vs, what wyll a
great nomber of our prestes saye to
these wordes of S. Austen? I feare
moche, that if he were not so aūcient
a Doctore, and a sayncte all redy approued
by the Chyrche, surely many
prestes for madnes wolde nothynge
feare to accuse hym of here
                  •
               y, and to
affirme that he preacheth hereticall
doctrine, so iopardous a thynge at
this tyme is it to speake agēst these
ignorant Rabines, which although
they knowe nothyng, yet wyll they

be Iudges ouer all menne, and redy
streyghtewayes to condemne them.
It is not the long robe, the flaryng
typpet about the necke, the annoyntynge
of the fyngers, the brode shauynge
of the crowne, that make the
the Preste, but knowledge and con
               
                  •
               ynge
in the lawe of the Lorde, and
so called vnto prestehode. The Prophet
Malachy sayth, the lyppes of a
Preste kepe knowledge,Ma
                     •
                  ac. ii and at hys
mouthe shall they require the lawe,
for he is the messanger of the Lorde
of Hoostes.Prestes oughte to be learned in y• law of god So sayth S. Austē here
that Prestes ought to be so wel learned
in the holy scriptures, that whā
ony man demaundeth a question of
them concernyng the lawe of God,
they shulde be able to answer. If he
be a preste, saythe he, let hym knowe
the lawe of the Lord. If he knoweth
not the lawe of the Lorde, he declareth
euidently, that he is no preste.

S. Austen here affyrmethe,Who is a preste aft
                     •

                   mind that he
only is a preste, whyche hath knowledge
in the lawe of the Lorde. If
there wante the knowledge, it is an
euident argument, sayth he, y• there
is no Preste. It is happy that saynt
Austē is gone and a sayncte. For if he
were now alyue & a Byshop agayne,
as he was in times paste, and shulde
go on visitacion thorow out the dioces,
I thynke surely he wold depose
a great sorte of Prestes, as mē more
fytte for ye carte than for the chyrch.
For S. Austen measureth all presthode
by knowledge. It pertaynethe
vnto the Lordes Preste, sayth he, to
knowe the lawe, and whan he is demaunded,
to make answer of y• law.
He maye be a Preste of Baal,Obsequiū amicos, veritas odiū parit. of the

and can not abyde hys scalde &
scuruy backe thus to be rubbed, let
hym know that they be not my wordes,
but the wordes of S. Austen, a
man in hys tyme not only godly enspired,
and excellently learned, but
also of greate authorite before the
worlde. I onely reherse hys & other
holye Doctores wordes, because I
wolde gladly haue men to do truely
theyr office, and to set this sayeng of
the Psalmograph euer before theyr
eyes, Be not lyke a horse & a moyle,
whiche haue no vnderstanding.Psa. xxxi For
ignoraunce in al men is to be abhorred,
but in Prestes chefely. If after

S. Ierome,In Esa

Than shuld y• goodes of y• Paryshes

maye come to passe, yea & y• shortly.
            Thus se we both by the holy scriptures,Prestes must both preach syncerly, & also lyue godlye Luk. iiii. the aunciēt Doctors, and the
godly olde councels, how greatly all
Byshoppes and Prestes ought to be
occupyed in studyēg and preachyng
Goddes worde. But to thys theyr
godly preachyng they must also ioyne
a vertuous and pure lyfe, vnlesse
they edify not so muche wyth theyr
preachynge, as they destroye wythe
theyr wycked lyuyng. It is a shame
for a Phisiciō to be so spotted & pocky,
that it shall maye iustly be sayde
to him, Phisiciō heale thy selfe. God
sayde to the synner, sayth the Psalmographe,Psal. xiix why doste thou preache
my lawes, and take my Testament
in thy mouth: Thou haste hated to
be reformed, and thou haste caste awaye
my wordes behynde the. If y•
               
sawest a these, thou rannest wt hym,
and wythe adulterers dyddest thou
laye thy porcion. Thy mouth dydde
abound wyth cursed speakyng, and
thy tonge dyd couple craftely togyther
deceates. Thou dyddest sytte, &
speake agaynst thy brother, & agēst
thy mothers sonne dyddest thou lay
a stomblyng blocke. These thynges
haste thou done, and yet haue I holdē
my peace. Thou wyckedly thoghtest,
that I wolde be lyke vnto the,
but I wyll reproue the, & come face
to face agaynst the. O vnderstonde
these thynges, ye that forget God,
vnlesse he plucke you awaye, & there
be none y• can delyuer you. Sayncte
Paule also sayth,Rom. ii. thou that teachest
another, teachest not thy self. Thou
that preachest that men shulde not
steale, stealest thy selfe. Thou that
sayste that whoredome shulde not be
committed, playest the whoremonger

thy selfe. Thou that abhorrest
Images, robbest God of his honour
thy selfe. Thou that gloryest of the
lawe, thorowe breakyng of the law,
dishonorest God. For ye name of God
is euell spoken of among the Gentiles
thorowe you.
            Of these thynges it is euident, y•
it is not sufficient for prestes to preache
Goddes worde, except they also
leade a vertuous & godly lyfe.Math. v. Who
so euer doth and teacheth, he shal be
called great in the kyngdom of heauen,
sayth the scripture. Christ doth
not onely call prestes the salte of the
earth, but also the lyght of y• world.
Wythe theyr preachyng they season
the people,Prestes are not only called the salte of y• earthe, but also the lyght of the worlde but wythe theyr lyght of
godly conuersacion they shewe men
howe they ought towalke and lyue.
Therfore immediately is it subioyned,
lette your lyght so shyne before
menne, that they maye se your good

workes & glorify your father,i. Tim. iiii. which

to shewe thy selfe commendable to
God, a worke man that neadeth not
to be ashamedde. He that preacheth
Christ,In serm. deieiunio. sayth S. Ambrose, ought to
shewe hym selfe wholly estraunged
from all kynde of vices. S. Iohn̄
Chrisostome also sayth,In Math. it is a great
shame for Prestes, and for so many
as be of the Clergy, whan laye men
be founde faythfuller & more ryghteous
than they are? Howe canne it
otherwyse be than a shame for them
to be inferioure to the laye people,
whome to be lyke vnto them, it is also
a shame? Agē. S. Gregory sayth,
the lyght of the flocke is the flame of

in hym as in y• glasse of theyr lyght,
the people that is committed vnto
hym maye bothe discerne what they
shulde follow, and also se what they
shulde correcte and amende. Hereof
is it euident, what great purite and
innocency of lyfe ought to be in prestes,
that theyr lyfe may correspond
and in all poyntes answere to theyr
preachyng.
            But here is an answer to be made
to the vnsauery talke of certen men
nowe a dayes, which because they se
the manners of the Preachers not
agreable in all poyntes to theyr sermons,
faull at defyaunce with gods
worde, blaspheme it as heresy, rayle
vpon the preachers and absent them
selfes from the hearyng of all godly
exhortacions, warnynges and coū
               cels.
These parsons hynder no man

let vs heare what the holy scripture

               fore
that they commaunde you to kepe,
loke that you kepe and do, but accordyng
to theyr workes do ye not. For
they say, but they do not. Here christ
commaundethe vs not to abstayne
from the hearyng of Goddes worde,
though they be neuer so wicked and
euyll, that preache it. For who were

more vngodly, and greater enemies
to Christ, than the Scribes & Phareses,
yet Christ commaundethe to
heare them so longe as they sytte in
the chayer of Moses.What it is to syt in the chayer of 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                To syt in the
chayer of Moses is truely & syncerly
to preach those thynges that Moses
dyd, to enterpret the lawe accordyng
to the ryght vayne of the holy
scripture, and only to seake the glory
of God & the profyt of the faythfull.
So long as they that are preachers
do thys, they are to be hearde,
though theyr lyfe be neuer so abhominable.
For it is not the preacher,
to whome we must haue pryncipall
respecte, but to the word of God. Nother
do we come into the Temple to
gase vpon the Preacher, but to hear
the holy scriptures declared, and so
lerne to lede a godly lyfe. If he were
one of the ministers of Satan, yea
Satan hymselfe that preacheth, so

longe as he bryngethe in Scriptum est,
so long as he teacheth purely the diuine
scripture wythout wreastyngEuerye mā y• preachethe ye scripture trulye is to be hearde, be hys lyfe neuer so wycked.
or corruptynge of the same, he is to
be hearde. We ought not so greatly
to marke the teacher, as that which
is taught. If he teachethe well, it is
ours, & we haue that we came for, if
he lyueth well, it is his owne, and he
shal receaue the rewarde. But lette
vs heare what Chrisostome sayth to
thys matter.In Math Cap. xxiii. If the preste
                  •
                lyue wel
sayth he, it is theyr auauntage, but
if they teache well, it is yours. Be
not curioꝰ to boul
                  •
               e out that, which
pertayneth vnto another man. For
oftentymes good learnyng comethe
forthe from an euyll manne, as vyle
earth bryngeth forth precious gold.
Is precious golde despysed for the
vile earth? Therfore as the golde is
chosen, and the earth forsakē, so lykewyse
take you the learnyng, & leaue

the manners. Agayne he saythe, let
vs take the doctrine but not the mā
               ners.
Herbes are not necessary for
the bees, but the floures are. So you
lykewyse gather the floures of doctrine,
and leaue theyr fashons of lyuyng.
Here this holy Doctore wylleth
vs not to despyse y• word, thoughe
the Preacher be euell. Lette vs
take that is oures, and let go that
is hys. The doctrine is oures, y• lyfe
is hys I had rather haue a syncer
preacher of Gods worde, which shal
declare Christ vnto me purely, rebuke
my synful lyuyng, conforte me
wyth the swete promises of GOD,
shewe me howe I ought to institute
my lyfe according to y• wyl of god. &c
although hys māners be somewhat
corrupte and dissent from his preachyng,
thā to haue a wicked Papist,
a pestilēt Pharese & a supersticious
Hypocrite, whiche shall outwardely

lyke a crafty foxe pretēd a certayne
grauite, and a popeholy manner of
lyuynge, and yet corrupte the holye
scriptures, confounde Gods worde
wyth mens tradicions, lede the people
into supersticious errours, flatter
the herers, preach for lucre, māckle
the doctrine of Christ, & obscure
the waye of trueth. Of suche Christ
warneth vs to take hede in the Gospell
of Mathew,Math. vi
                     •
                  
                sayeng, Beware of
false Prophetes, whiche come vnto
you in shepes clothyng, but inwardly
they are rauening wolfes. Agenst
these Christ in another place thondereth,Math. xxiii
sayeng, wo be to you Scribes
and Phareses, hypocrites, for ye are
lyke paynted sepulchres, which outwardly
appere beautifull, but within
are full of bones of dead men and
of all fylthynes. So ye lykewyse appere
outwardely ryghteous to mē,
but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisye

and wyckednes. Agayne, ye are
they, that iustify your selfes before
mē,Luke. xvi. Psal. i. but God knoweth your hartes.
For that whyche semeth prayse worthy
before men, is abhominable before
God. Therfore so long as yc preacher
sytteth in the chayer of Moses
and not in the chayer of pestilēce, he
is to be hearde for the wordes sake,
be hys lyfe neuer so wycked & vngodly.
Notwythstondyng I exhorte all
Christen Preachers, and so many as
vnfaynedly tender the glory of god,
and the promociō of hys moost b
                  •
               yssed
worde, that they do theyr endeuour
not only to set forthe Goddes
trueth in worde & tonge, but also in
worcke and verite. Let them be the
same in lyfe, yt they professe in word.
For he takethe vpon hym the name
of a Christen man in vayne, saythe
sayncte Austen,Cura esse quodlubē
                  
                  
                     •
                  er audis. that followethe not
Christ. For what dothe it profyt the

to be called that thou arte not,Lib. de doctrina christiana. & to
vsurpe a straunge name? If yu haste
a pleasure to be a Christen man, do
those thynges that pertayne vnto
Christianite, and than hardely take
vpon the the name of a Christiane.
S. Ambrose also sayth,In Ser. de Abraham. it is a shamefull
lye before ony man to call hymselfe
a Christen man, & not to do the
workes of Christ. Hereto ꝑlaynethe
the sayeng of S. Cypriane,De. xii. abusionibus, no man
is truely called a Christiane, but he
whyche laboureth, so moche as lygheth
in hys power, to shewe hymselfe
conformable & lyke to Christ in hys
manners & conuersacion. He y• sayth,
y• he dwelleth in Christ,i. Ioan. ii. saiths. Ioh
                  •
               
               ̄,
ought to walke as he hathe walked.
            Seyng than that so great purite
and innocency of lyfe is required of
all men that professe Christ, surely
in Prestes and in thē that are preachers
of Gods worde,Math. v. it ought to excell

aboue all other. Men lyght not
a candle, and put it vnder a bushel,
but vpon a candlesticke, & it shyneth
to so many as are in the house. So
lykewyse Prestes are not called vnto
the office of preachyng, that theyr
conuersacion shulde be darke and wt
               out
lyght, but that it shuldbe so garnyshed
wyth godly vertues & good
workes, that it myghte lyghte to so
many as are in the house of God.
            Christ the hygh preste & euerlastyng
Byshoppe graunt it maye so be.
            But as I may returne vnto our
matter of swearynge, let them that
be Preachers, I say, aboue all thynges
rebuke this abhominable synne
of swearyng, & declare vnto the people
what a great offence it is, & howe
the plages of God and hys vēgeaūs
shal not departe from the houses of
them, that vse thys moost detestable
synne of swearyng.
            
               
Furthermore let all fathers and
mothers gyue earnest diligēce thatFathers & mothers
theyr chyldren maye from theyr very
cradles learne to worshyppe and
honour y• moost blyssed name of god,
and neuer to haue it in theyr mouthes
wythout great reuerence done
vnto it, eyther by puttynge of theyr
cappes or elles by boweynge theyr
knees. Let them not be suffered by ony
meanes to sweare by God or by
onye of hys creatures,Math. v Iacob. v but let your
cōmunicacion be yea, yea, nay, nay.
If they at onye tyme sweare, lette
them fyrste of all be admonysshed of
theyr faute, and tolde how great an
offēce it is before God wyckedly and
vaynely to sweare. If they wyll not
so amende, let the parentes ponyshe
them sharpely. Better were it, that
theyr bodyes in thys worlde shulde
suffer a lytyll payne, than after this
lyfe to haue bothe theyr bodyes and

soules caste into hell fyre. If all fathers
and mothers wyl thus diligētly
watche vpon theyr chyldrē, it shal
cause them not only not to be defyled
wythe the moost greuous synne
of swearing, but also that the moost
holy name of GOD shall be had in
hygh reuerence, great estimacion &
perpetuall honoure for euer after so
longe as they lyue. But aboue all
thynges lette the parentes them selues
be an ensample in thys behalfe
vnto theyr chyldren, and shew euermore
such reuerence vnto the name
of God, that the yonglynges maye
well perceaue, that it is no vayne
thyng, that they are taught.
            Let all masters and mastresses &
so many as haue seruauntes vnder
theyr dominion,Masters & mastresses prouyde that by no
meanes they suffer theyr seruaūtes
at ony tyme to swear nether by god
nor by ony of his creatures. Let thē
               
shewe vnto them what a great daū
               ger
it is,Eccle. xxii. and howe that the vēgeaūs
of God shall not departe from those
houses, where swearers are, nether
can there ony thyng prosper, but all
thynges must nedes go to hauocke.
Let them also teache them to haue
the name of God in so great honour
& reuerence, that it neuer be named
among them but honorably and reuerently.
Let them at the least put
of theyr cappes so ofte as they name
God, Christ, or ony part of his moste
precious bodye. If ony of theyr seruauntes
wyll not leaue theyr swearynge,
and learne to haue the name
of God in honoure, than let them be
put out of theyr houses, vnlesse they
bryng the vengeaunce of God vpon
so many as are in theyr company.
            For as the godlynesse of one man is
many tymes thoccasiō,Nota. that God is
marciful to many, so is the wyckednes

of one man oftentymes y• cause y•
many are ponyshed. Therfore it is
not ynoughe that the masters & the
mastresses of the house be vertuous
and godly, excepte the seruaūtes be
so lykewyse. It becommeth a master
to haue Seruauntes lyke vnto hys
owne manners, vnlesse his goodnes
profyteth not so moche in the ryght
institucion of hys family, as y• wyckednes
of the other destroyeth. It is
well, whan one plantethe & another
waterethe, but it is euyll, whan one
planteth and another plucketh vp.

to forsake all vayne & idle
oothes,The conclusion of the booke let vs remember, that God,
which is ye euerlastyng truthe, hath
promised, that he wyll glorify them,
whiche honoure hym and haue hys
name in reuerence: Agen, that they
shall come vnto dishonour & a shamefull

ende, that despyse hym and blaspheme
hys moost holye name. Nowe
if we wyll that God glorify vs,God to glorify vs what it is that
is to saye, be our good Lord, defend
preserue, kepe & gouerne vs, blysse
vs, lyghten hys gracious coūtenās
vpon vs, sende vs all thynges necessary
for our lyuynge in this present
worlde, and after thys lyfe gyue vs
eternall glory: than is it conuenient
that we do not abuse y• name of god
by our vayne & vnrighteous othes,
but alwayes laude, prayse, cōmend,
magnify & blysse it, caull vpon it, fly
vnto it as vnto an holye anchore in
all our aduersite, and neuer to haue
in our mouthes,What euylles shall chaunse vnto vs, if we vaynly swere? but wythe hygh reuerence
and great honour. If we do
the contrary, yt is to saye, blaspheme
hys moost holy name, than shall we
vndoubtedly come vnto dishonoure
& a shamefull ende. In thys worlde
the plage and vēgeaūce of God shall

not go awaye from oure houses, we
shal be stryken wyth many greuous
diseases in our bodyes, oure goodes
and cattell, yea and all that euer we
haue shal come to noght, our kynde
of lyuyng shall be despysed wyth all
good men, our death shall be paynefull,
miserable and wretched, & after
these so great and manifold plages,
we maye be sure for our wycked sweryng
to be cast into hell fyre, where
