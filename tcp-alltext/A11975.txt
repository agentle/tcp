               SHall I call in Thambassadors my Liege?
            
            
               King.
               Not yet my Cousin, til we be resolude
               Of some serious matters touching vs and France.
               
            
            
               Bi.
               God and his Angels guard your sacred throne,
               And make you long become it.
            
            
               King.
               Shure we thank you. And good my Lord proceed
               Why the Lawe Salicke which they haue in France,
               
               Or should or should not, stop vs in our clayme:
               And God forbid my wise and learned Lord,
               That you should fashion, frame, or wrest the same.
               For God doth know how many now in health,
               Shall drop their blood in approbation,
               Of what your reuerence shall incite vs too.
               Therefore take heed how you impawne our person.
               How you awake the sleeping sword of warre:
               We charge you in the name of God take heed.
               After this coniuration, speake my Lord:
               And we will iudge, note, and beleeue in heart,
               That what you speake, is washt as pure
               As sin in baptisme.
               
                  Then heare me gracious soueraigne, and you peeres,
               Which owe your liues, your faith and seruices
               To this imperiall throne.
               There is no bar to stay your highnesse claime to France
               
               But one, which they produce from Faramount,
               
               No female shall succeed in salicke land,
               Which salicke land the French vniustly gloze
               To be the realme of France:
               
               And Faramont the founder of this law and female barre:
               Yet their owne writers faithfully affirme
               That the land salicke lyes in Germany,
               
               Betweene the flouds of Sabeck and of Elme,
               
               Where Charles the fift hauing subdude the Saxons,
               There left behind, and setled certaine French,
               Who holding in disdaine the Germaine women,
               For some dishonest maners of their liues,
               Establisht there this lawe. To wit,
               No female shall succeed in salicke land:
               Which salicke land as I said before,
               Is at this time in Germany called Mesene:
               
               Thus doth it well appeare the salicke lawe
               Was not deuised for the realme of France,
               
               Nor did the French possesse the salicke land,
               Vntill 400. one and twentie yeares
               After the function of king Faramount,
               
               Godly supposed the founder of this lawe:
               
                  Hugh Capet also that vsurpt the crowne,
               To fine his title with some showe of truth,
               When in pure truth it was corrupt and naught:
               Conuaid himselfe as heire to the Lady Inger,
               
               Daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorain,
               
               So that as cleare as is the sommers Sun,
               King Pippins title and Hugh Capets claime,
               King Charles his satisfaction all appeare,
               To hold in right and title of the female:
               So do the Lords of France vntil this day,
               Howbeit they would hold vp this salick lawe
               
                  To bar your highnesse claiming from the female,
               And rather choose to hide them in a net,
               Then amply to imbrace their crooked causes,
               Vsurpt from you and your progenitors.
            
            
               K.
               May we with right & conscience make this claime▪
               
            
            
               Bi.
               The sin vpon my head dread soueraigne.
               For in the booke of Numbers is it writ,
               When the sonne dies, let the inheritance
               Descend vnto the daughter.
               Noble Lord stand for your owne,
               Vnwinde your bloody flagge,
               Go my dread Lord to your great graunsirs graue,
               From whom you clayme:
               And your great Vncle Edward the blacke Prince,
               Who on the French ground playd a Tragedy
               Making defeat on the full power of France,
               
               Whilest his most mighty father on a hill,
               Stood smiling to behold his Lyons whelpe,
               Foraging blood of French Nobilitie.
               O Noble English that could entertaine
               With halfe their Forces the full power of France:
               
               And let an other halfe stand laughing by,
               All out of worke, and cold for action.
            
            
               King.
               We must not onely arme vs against the French,
               But lay downe our proportion for the Scot,
               Who will make rode vpon vs with all aduantages.
            
            
               Bi.
               The Marches gracious soueraigne, shalbe sufficient▪
               
               To guard your England from the pilfering borderers.
            
            
               King.
               We do not meane the coursing sneakers onely,
               But feare the mayne entendement of the Scot,
               For you shall read, neuer my great grandfather
               Vnmaskt his power for France,
               
               But that the Scot on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,
               Came pouring like the Tide into a breach,
               That England being empty of defences,
               Hath shooke and trembled at the brute hereof.
            
            
               Bi.
               She hath bin then more feared then hurt my Lord:
               
                  For heare her but examplified by her selfe,
               When all her chiualry hath bene in France
               
               And she a mourning widow of her Nobles,
               She hath her selfe not only well defended,
               But taken and impounded as a stray, the king of Scots,
               Whom like a caytiffe she did leade to France,
               
               Filling your Chronicles as rich with praise
               As is the owse and bottome of the sea
               With sunken wrack and shiplesse treasurie.
            
            
               Lord.
               There is a saying very old and true,
               If you will France win,
               Then with Scotland first begin:
               For once the Eagle, England being in pray,
               To his vnfurnish nest the weazel Scot
               Would suck her egs, playing the mouse in absence of the cat:
               To spoyle and hauock more then she can eat.
            
            
               Exe.
               It followes then, the cat must stay at home,
               Yet that is but a curst necessitie,
               Since we haue trappes to catch the petty theeues:
               Whilste that the armed hand doth fight abroad
               The aduised head controlles at home:
               For gouernment though high or lowe, being put into parts,
               Congrueth with a mutuall consent like musicke.
            
            
               Bi.
               True: therefore doth heauen diuide the fate of man in diuers functions.
               Whereto is added as an ayme or but, obedience:
               For so liue the honey Bees, creatures that by awe
               Ordaine an act of order to a peopeld Kingdome:
               They haue a King and officers of sort,
               Where some like Magistrates correct at home:
               Others like Marchants venture trade abroad:
               Others like souldiers armed in their stings,
               Make boote vpon the sommers veluet bud:
               Which pillage they with mery march bring home
               To the tent royall of their Emperour,
               Who busied in his maiestie, behold
               The singing masons building roofes of gold:
               
                  The ciuell citizens lading vp the honey,
               The sad eyde Iustice with his surly humme,
               Deliuering vp to executors pale, the lazy caning Drone.
               This I infer, that 20. actions once a foote,
               May all end in one moment.
               As many Arrowes losed seuerall wayes, flye to one marke:
               As many seuerall wayes meete in one towne:
               As many fresh streames run in one selfe sea:
               As many lines close in the dyall center:
               So may a thousand actions once a foote,
               End in one moment, and be all well borne without defect.
               Therefore my Liege to France,
               
               Diuide your happy England into foure,
               Of which take you one quarter into France,
               
               And you withall, shall make all Gallia shake,
               If we with thrice that power left at home,
               Cannot defend our owne doore from the dogge,
               Let vs be beaten, and from henceforth lose
               The name of pollicy and hardinesse.
            
            
               Ki.
               Call in the messenger sent frō the Dolphin,
               And by your ayde, the noble sinewes of our land,
               
                  France being ours, weele bring it to our awe,
               Or breake it all in peeces:
               Eyther our Chronicles shal with full mouth speak
               Freely of our acts,
               Or else like toonglesse mutes
               Not worshipt with a paper Epitaph:
               Enter Thambassadors from France.
               Now are we well prepared to know the Dolphins pleasure,
               For we heare your comming is from him.
            
            
               Ambassa.
               Pleaseth your Maiestie to giue vs leaue
               Freely to render what we haue in charge:
               Or shall I sparingly shew a farre off,
               The Dolphins pleasure and our Embassage?
            
            
               King.
               We are no tyrant, but a Christian King,
               To whom our spirit is as subiect,
               As are our wretches fettered in our prisons.
               
                  Therefore freely and with vncurbed boldnesse
               Tell vs the Dolphins minde.
            
            
               Ambas.
               Then this in fine the Dolphin saith,
               Whereas you clayme certaine Townes in France,
               
               From your predecessor king Edward the third,
               This he returnes.
               He saith, theres nought in France that can be with a nimble
               Galliard wonne: you cannot reuel into Dukedomes there:
               Therefore he sendeth meeter for your study,
               This tunne of treasure: and in lieu of this,
               Desires to let the Dukedomes that you craue
               Heare no more from you: This the Dolphin saith.
            
            
               King.
               What treasure Vncle?
            
            
               Exe.
               Tennis balles my Liege.
            
            
               King.
               We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs,
               Your message and his present we accept:
               When we haue matched our rackets to these balles,
               We will by Gods grace play such a set,
               Shall strike his fathers crowne into the hazard.
               Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler,
               That all the Courts of France shall be disturbd with chases.
               And we vnderstand him well, how he comes ore vs
               With our wilder dayes, not measuring what vse we made of them.
               We neuer valued this poore seate of England.
               And therefore gaue our selues to barbarous licence:
               As tis common seene that men are merriest when they are from home.
               But tell the Dolphin we will keepe our state,
               Be like a King, mightie and commaund,
               When we do rowse vs in throne of France:
               
               For this haue we laid by our Maiestie
               And plodded lide a man for working dayes.
               But we will rise there with so full of glory,
               That we will dazell all the eyes of France,
               
               I strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,
               And tell him this, his mock hath turnd his balles to gun stones,
               
                  And his soule shall sit sore charge for the wastfull vengeance
               That shall flye from them. For this his mocke
               Shall mocke many a wife out of their deare husbands.
               Mocke mothers from their sonnes, mocke Castles downe,
               I some are yet vngotten and vnborne,
               That shall haue cause to curse the Dolphins scorne.
               But this lyes all within the will of God, to whom we doo appeale,
               And in whose name tel you the Dolphin we are com̄ing on
               To venge vs as we may, and to put forth our hand
               In a rightfull cause: so get you hence, and tell your Prince,
               His lest will sauour but of shallow wit,
               When thousands weepe, more then did laugh at it.
               Conuey them with safe conduct: see them hence.
            
            
               Exe.
               This was a merry message.
            
            
               King.
               We hope to make the sender blush at it:
               Therfore let our collectiō for the wars be soone prouided:
               For God before, weell check the Dolphin at his fathers doore.
               Therefore let euery man now taske his thought,
               That this faire action may on foote be brought.

               We therefore haue great cause of thankfulnesse,

               So seruice shall with steeled sinewes shine,
               And labour shall refresh it selfe with hope
               To do your Grace incessant seruice.
            
            
               King.
               Vncle of Exeter, enlarge the man
               Committed yesterday, that rayled against our person,
               We consider it was the heate of wine that set him on,
               And on his more aduice we pardon him.
            
            
               Masha.
               That is mercie, but too much securitie:
               Let him bee punisht Soueraigne, least the example of him,
               Breed more of such a kinde.

               King.
               Alas your too much care and loue of me
               Are heauy orisons gainst the poore wretch,
               If litle faults proceeding on distemper should not bee winked at,
               How should we stretch our eye, when capitall crimes,
               Chewed, swallowed and disgested, appeare before vs:
               Well yet enlarge the man, tho Cambridge and the rest
               In their deare loues, and tender preseruation of our state,
               Would haue him punisht.
               Now to our French causes.

               So did you me my Soueraigne.

               And me my Lord.
            
            
               King.
               Then Richard Earle of Cambridge there is yours.
               There is yours my Lord of Masham.
               
               And sir Thomas Gray knight of Northumberland, this same is yours:
               Read them, and know we know your worthinesse.
               Vnckle Exeter I will aboord to night.
               Why how now Gentlemen, why change you colour?
               What see you in those papers
               That hath so chased your blood out of apparance?
            
            
               Cam.
               I do confesse my fault, and do submit me
               To your highnesse mercie.
            
            
               Mash.
               To which we all appeale.
            
            
               King.
               The mercy which was quit in vs but late,
               By your owne reasons is forestald and done:
               You must not dare for shame to aske for mercy,
               For your owne conscience turne vpon your bosomes,
               As dogs vpon their maisters worrying them.
               See you my Princes, and my noble Peeres.
               These English monsters:
               My Lord of Cambridge here,
               You know how apt we were to grace him,
               In all things belonging to his honour:
               And this vilde man hath for a fewe light crownes,
               Lightly conspired and sworne vnto the practises of France:
               To kill vs here in Hampton. To the which,
               This knight no lesse in bountie bound to vs
               Then Cambridge is, haah likewise sworne.
               But oh what shall I say to thee false man,
               Thou cruell ingratefull and inhumane creature,
               Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsell,
               That knewst the very secrets of my heart,
               That almost mightest a coyned me into gold,
               Wouldest thou a practisde on me for thy vse:
               Can it be possible that out of thee
               Should proceed one sparke that might annoy my finger?
               
                  Tis so strange, that tho the truth doth showe as grose
               As black from white, mine eye wil scarcely see it.
               Their faults are open, arrest them to the answer of the lawe,
               And God acquit them of their practises.
            
            
               Exe.
               I arrest thee of high treason,
               By the name of Richard, Earle of Camhridge.
               
               I arest thee of high treason,
               By the name of Henry, Lord of Masham,
               
               I arest thee of high treason,
               By the name of Thomas Gray, knight of Northumberland.
               
            
            
               Mash.
               Our purposes God iustly hath discouered,
               And I repent my fault more then my death,
               Which I beseech your maiestie forgiue,
               Altho my body pay the price of it.
            
            
               King.
               God quit you in his mercy. Heare your sentence.
               You haue conspired against our royall person,
               Ioyned with an enemy proclaimed and fixed.
               And frō

               Touching our person we seeke no redresse.
               But we our kingdomes safetie must so tender
               Whose ruine you haue sought,
               That to our lawes we do deliuer you.
               Get ye therefore hence: poore miserable creatures to your death,
               The taste whereof, God in his mercy giue you
               Patience to endure, and true repentance of all your deeds amisse:
               Beare them hence.
               Exit three Lords.
               Now Lords to France. The enterprise whereof,
               Shall be to you as vs, successiuely.
               Since God cut off this dangerous treason lurking in our way
               Cheerly to sea, the signes of war aduance:
               No King of England, if not King of France.
               
            
            Exit omnes.

               Host.
               I, he is in Arthors bosom, if euer any were:
               He went away as if it were a crysombd childe,
               Betweene twelue and one,
               Iust at turning of the tide:
               His nose was as sharpe as a pen:
               For when I saw him fumble with the sheetes,
               And talk of floures, and smile vpō his fingers ends
               I knew there was no way but one.
               How now sir Iohn quoth I?
               And he cryed three times, God, God, God,
               Now I to comfort him, bad him not think of God,
               I hope there was no such need.
               Then he bad me put more cloathes at his feere:
               And I felt to them, and they were as cold as any stone:
               And to his knees, and they were as cold as any stone.
               And so vpward, and vpward, and all was as cold as any stone.
            
            
               Nim.

               And of women.
            
            
               Host.
               No that he did not.
            
            
               Boy.
               Yes that he did: and he sed they were diuels incarnat.
            
            
               Host.
               Indeed carnation was a colour he neuer loued.
            
            
               Nim.
               Well he did cry out on women.
            
            
               Host.
               Indeed he did in some sort handle women,
               But then he was rumaticke, and talkt of the whore of Babylon.
               
            
            
               Boy.
               Hostes do you remember he saw a Flea stand
               Vpon Bardolfes Nose, and sed it was a black soule
               Burning in hell fire?

               Well, God be with him,
               That was all the wealth I got in his seruice.

               Therefore cophetua be thy counsellor,

               Her scepter so fantastically borne,
               So guided by a shallow humorous youth,

               How well supplied with aged Counsellours,
               And how his resolution andswered him,
               You then would say that Harry was not wilde.
            
            
               King.

               He wils you in the name of God Almightie,
               That you deuest your selfe and lay apart
               That borrowed tytle, which by gift of heauen,
               Of lawe of nature, and of nations, longs
               To him and to his heires, namely the crowne
               And all wide stretched titles that belongs
               Vnto the Crowne of France, that you may know
               Tis no sinister, nor no awkeward claime,
               Pickt from the worm
                     •
                   holes of old vanisht dayes,
               Nor from the dust of old obliuion rackte,

               Your crowne and kingdome, indirectly held
               From him, the natiue and true challenger.

               Bloody cōstraint, for if you hide the crown
               Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
               Therefore in fierce tempest is he comming,
               In thunder, and in earthquake, like a Ioue,
               
               That if requiring faile, he will compell it:
               And on your heads turnes he the widowes teares,
               The Orphanes cries, the dead mens bones,
               The pining maydens grones.
               For husbands, fathers, and distressed louers,
               Which shall be swallowed in this controuersie.
               This is his claime, his threatning, and my message▪

               Exe.
               Scorn & defiance, slight regard, contempt,

               Thus saith my king. Vnles your fathers highnesse

               For I desire nothing so much,
               As oddes with England.
               And for that cause according to his youth
               I did present him with those Paris balles.

               Go.
               How now Captain Flewellen, come you frō the bridge?
            
            
               Flew.
               By Iesus thers excellēt seruice cōmitted at ye bridge.
            
            
               Gour.
               Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
            
            
               Flew.
               The duke of Exeter is a mā whom I loue, & I honor,
               And I worship, with my soule, and my heart, and my life,
               And my lands and my liuings,
               And my vttermost powers.
               The Duke is looke you,
               God be praised and pleased for it, no harme in the worell.
               He is maintain the bridge very gallently: there is an Ensigne
               
                  There, I do not know how you call him, but by Iesus I think
               He is as valient a man as Marke Anthonie, he doth maintain
               the bridge most gallantly: yet he is a man of no reckoning:
               But I did see him do gallant seruice.
            
            
               Gouer.
               How do you call him?
            
            
               Flew.
               His name is ancient Pistoll.
               
            
            
               Gouer.
               I know him not.
            
            
               Enter Ancient Pistoll.
            
               Flew.
               Do you not know him, here comes the man.
            
            
               Pist.
               Captaine, I thee beseech to do me fauour,
               The Duke of Exeter doth loue thee well.
            
            
               Flew.
               I, and I praise God I haue merrited some loue at his hands.
            
            
               Pist.
               
                  Bardolfe a souldier, one of buxsome valour,
               Hath by furious fate
               And giddy Fortunes fickle wheele,
               That Godes blinde that stands vpon the rowling restlesse stone.
            
            
               Flew.
               By your patience ancient Pistoll,
               
               Fortune, looke you is painted,
               Plind with a mufler before her eyes,
               To signifie to you, that Fortune is plind:
               And she is moreouer painted with a wheele,
               Which is the morall that Fortune is turning,
               And inconstant, and variation; and mutabilities:
               And her fate is fixed at a sphericall stone
               Which roules, and roules, and roules:
               Surely the Poet is make an exellēt descriptiō of Fortune.
               Fortune looke you is and excellent morall.
            
            
               Pist.
               Fortune is Bardolfes foe, and frownes on him,
               For he hath stolne a packs, and hanged must he be:
               A damned death, let gallowes gape for dogs,
               Let man go free, and let not death his windpipe stop.
               
                  But Exeter hath giuen the doome of death,
               For packs of pettie price:
               Therefore go speake the Duke will heare thy voyce,
               And let not Bardolfes vitall threed be cut,
               With edge of penny cord▪ and vile approach.
               Speake Captaine for his life, and I will thee requite.
            
            
               Flew.
               Captain Pistoll, I partly vnderstand your meaning.
            
            
               Pist.
               Why then reioyce therefore.
            
            
               Flew.
               Certainly Antient Pistol, tis not a thing to reioyce at,
               For if he were my owne brother, I would wish the Duke
               To do his pleasure, and put him to executions: for look you,
               Disciplines ought to be kept, they ought to be kept.
            
            
               Pist.
               Die and be damned, and fig a for thy friendship.
            
            
               Flew.
               That is good.
            
            
               Pist.
               The figge of Spaine within thy Iawe.
            
            
               Flew.
               That is very well.
            
            
               Pist.
               I say the fig within thy bowels and thy durty maw.
            
            Exit Pistoll.
            
               Fle.
               Captain Gour, cannot you hear it lighten & thunder?
            
            
               Gour.
               Why is this the Ancient you told me of?
               I remember him now, he is a bawd, a cutpurse.
            
            
               Flew.
               By Iesus heeis vtter as praue words vpon the bridge
               As you shall desire to see in a sommers day, but its all one,
               What he hath sed to me, looke you, is all one.
            
            
               Go.
               Why thi
                     •
                   is a gul, a foole, a rogue that goes to the wars
               Onely to grace himselfe at his returne to London:
               And such feliowes as he,
               Are perfect in great Commaunders names.
               They will learne by rote where seruices were done,
               At such and such a scence, at such a breach,
               At such a conuoy: who came off brauely, who was shot,
               Who disgraced, what termes the enemie stood on.
               And this they con perfectly in phrase of warre,
               Which they trick vp with new tuned oathes, & what a berd
               Of the Generalls cut, and a horid shout of the campe
               
                  Will do among the foming bottles and ale washt wits
               Is wonderfull to be thought on: but you must learne
               To know such slaunders of this age,
               Or else you may maruellously be mistooke.
            
            
               Flew.
               Certain captain Gower, it is not the man, looke you,
               That I did take him to be: but when time shall serue,
               I shall tell him a litle of my desires: here comes his Maiestie.
            
            
               Fnter King, Clarence, Gloster and others.
            
            
               King.
               How now Flewellen, come you from the bridge?
            
            
               Flew.
               I and it shall please your Maiestie,
               There is excellent seruice at the bridge.
            
            
               King.
               What men haue you lost Flewellen?
               
            
            
               Flew.
               And it shall please your Maiestie,
               The partition of the aduersarie hath bene great,
               Very reasonably great: but for our own parts, like you now,
               I thinke we haue lost neuer a man, vnlesse it be one
               For robbing of a church, one Bardolfe, if your Maiestie
               Know the man, his face is full of whelkes and knubs,
               And pumples, and his breath blowes at his nose
               Like a cole, sometimes red, sometimes plew:
               But god be praised, now his nose is executed, & his fire out.
            
            
               King.
               We would haue all offenders so cut off,
               And we here giue expresse commaundment,
               That there be nothing taken from the villages but paid for,
               None of the French abused,
               Or abraided with disdainfull language:
               For when cruelty and lenitie play for a Kingdome,
               The gentlest gamester is the sooner winner.
            
            Enter French Herauld.
            
               Hera.
               You know me by my habit.
            
            
               Ki.
               Well thē, we know thee, what shuld we know of thee?
            
            
               Hera.
               My maisters minde.
            
            
               King.
               Vnfold it.
            
            
               Heral.
               Go thee vnto Harry of England, and tell him,
               Aduantage is a better souldier then rashnesse:
               
                  Altho we did seeme dead, we did but slumber.
               Now we speake vpon our kue, and our voyce is imperiall,
               England shall repent her folly: see her rashnesse,
               And admire our sufferance. Which to raunsome,
               His pettinesse would bow vnder:
               For the effusion of our blood, his army is too weake:
               For the disgrace we haue borne, himselfe
               Kneeling at our feete, a weake and worthlesse satisfaction.
               To this, adde defyance. So much from the king my maister.
            
            
               King.
               What is thy name? we know they qualitie.
            
            
               Herald.
               Montioy.
            
            
               King.
               Thou dost thy office faire, returne thee backe,
               And tell thy King, I do not seeke him now:
               But could be well content, without impeach,
               To march on to Callis: for to say the sooth,
               Though tis no wisdome to confesse so much
               Vnto an enemie of craft and vantage.
               My souldiers are with sicknesse much infeebled,
               My Army lessoned, and those fewe I haue,
               Almost no better then so many French:
               Who when they were in heart, I tell thee Herauld,
               I thought vpon one paire of English legges,
               Did march three French mens.
               Yet forgiue me God, that I do brag thus:
               This your heire of France hath blowne this vice in me.
               I must repent, go tell thy maister here I am,
               My raunsome is this frayle and worthlesse body,
               My Army but a weake and sickly guarde.
               Yet God before, we will come on,
               If France and such an other neighbour stood in our way:
               If we may passe, we will: if we be hindered,
               We shal your tawny ground with your red blood discolour.
               So Montioy get you gone, there is for your paines:
               The sum of all our answere is but this,
               We would not seeke a battle as we are:
               
                  Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it.
            
            
               Herauld.
               I shall deliuer so: thanks to your Maiestie.
            
            
               Glos.
               My Liege, I hope they will not come vpon vs now.
            
            
               King.
               We are in Gods hand brother, not in theirs:
               To night we will encampe beyond the bridge,
               And on to morrow bid them march away.
            
            
               Enter Burbon, Constable, Orleance, Gebon.
            
               Const.
               Tut I haue the best armour in the world.
            
            
               Orleance.
               You haue an excellent armour,
               But let my horse haue his due.
            
            
               Burbon.
               Now you talke of a horse, I haue a steed like the
               Palfrey of the sun, nothing but pure ayre and fire,
               And hath none of this dull element of earth within him.
            
            
               Orleance.
               He is of the colour of the Nutmeg.
            
            
               Bur.
               And of the heate, a the Ginger.
               Turne all the sands into eloquent tongues,
               And my horse is argument for them all:
               I once writ a Sonnet in the praise of my horse,
               And began thus. Wonder of nature.
            
            
               Con.
               I haue heard a Sonnet begin so,
               In the praise of ones Mistresse.
            
            
               Burb.
               Why then did they immitate that
               Which I writ in praise of my horse,
               For my horse is my mistresse.
            
            
               Con.
               Ma foy the other day, me thought
               Your mistresse shooke you shrewdly.

               I bearing me. I tell thee Lord Constable,
               My mistresse weares her owne haire.
            
            
               Con.
               I could make as good a boast of that,
               If I had had a sow to my mistresse.
            
            
               Bur.
               Tut thou wilt make vse of any thing.
            
            
               Con.
               Yet I do not vse my horse for my mistresse.
            
            
               Bur.
               Will it neuer be morning?

               And my way shalbe paued with English faces.
            
            
               
               Con.
               By my faith so will not I,
               For feare I be outfaced of my way.

               Well the Duke of Burbon, is simply,
               The most actiue Gentleman of France.

               King.
               O then thou art better then the King?

               Kin.
               It sorts well with your fiercenesse.
            
            
               Pist.
               
                  Pistoll is my name.
            
            
               Exit Pistoll.
            Enter Gower and Flewellen.
            
               Gour.
               Captaine Flewellen.
               
            
            
               Flew.
               In the name of Iesu speake lewer.
               It is the greatest folly in the worell, when the auncient
               Prerogatiues of the warres be not kept.
               I warrant you, if you looke into the warres of the Romanes,
               You shall finde no tittle tattle, nor bible bable there:
               
                  But you shall finde the cares, and the feares,
               And the ceremonies, to be otherwise.
            
            
               Gour.
               Why the enemy is loud: you heard him all night.
            
            
               Flew.
               Godes sollud, if the enemy be an Asse & a Foole,
               And a prating cocks-come, is it meet that we be also a foole,
               And a prating cocks-come, in your conscience now?
            
            
               Gour.
               Ile speake lower.
            
            
               Flew.
               I beseech you do, good Captaine Gower.
               
            
            Exit Gower, and Flewellen.
            
               Kin.
               Tho it appeare a litle out of fashion,
               Yet theres much care in this.
            
            Enter three Souldiers.
            
               1. Soul.
               
               Is not that the morning yonder?
            
            
               2. Soul.
               
               I we see the beginning,
               God knowes whether we shall see the end or no.
            
            
               3. Soul.
               
               Well I thinke the king could wish himselfe
               Vp to the necke in the middle of the Thames,
               And so I would he were, at all aduentures, and I with him.
            
            
               Kin.
               Now masters god morrow, what cheare?
            
            
               3. S.
               I faith small cheer some of vs is like to haue,
               Ere this day ende.
            
            
               Kin.
               Why fear nothing man, the king is frolike.
            
            
               2. S.
               I he may be, for he hath no such cause as we
            
            
               Kin.
               Nay say not so, he is a man as we are.
               The Violet smels to him as to vs:
               Therefore if he see reasons, he feares as we do.
            
            
               2. Sol.
               
               But the king hath a heauy reckoning to make,
               If his cause be not good: when all those soules
               Whose bodies shall be slaughtered here,
               Shall ioyne together at the latter day,
               And say I dyed at such a place. Some swearing:
               Some their wiues rawly left:
               Some leauing their children poore behind them.
               
                  Now if his cause be bad, I think it will be a greeuous matter to him.
            
            
               King.
               Why so you may say, if a man send his seruant
               As Factor into another Countrey,
               And he by any meanes miscarry,
               You may say the businesse of the maister,
               Was the author of his seruants misfortune.
               Or if a sonne be imployd by his father,
               And he fall into any leaud action, you may say the father
               Was the author of his sonnes damnation.
               But the master is not to answere for his seruants,
               The father for his sonne, nor the king for his subiects:
               For they purpose not their deaths, whē they craue their seruices:
               Some there are that haue the gift of premeditated
               Murder on them:
               Others the broken seale of Forgery, in beguiling maydens.
               Now if these outstrip the lawe,
               Yet they cannot escape Gods punishment.
               War is Gods Beadel. War is Gods vengeance:
               Euery mans seruice is the kings:
               But euery mans soule is his owne.
               Therfore I would haue euery souldier examine himselfe,
               And wash euery moath out of his conscience:
               That in so doing, he may be the readier for death:
               Or not dying, why the time was well spent,
               Wherein such preparation was made.
            
            
               3 Lord.
               
               Yfaith he saies true:
               Euery mans fault on his owne head,
               I would not haue the king answere for me.
               Yet I intend to fight lustily for him.
            
            
               King.
               Well, I heard the king, he wold not be ransomde.

               But when our throates be cut, he may be ransomde,
               And we neuer the wiser,
            
            
               King.
               If I liue to see that, Ile neuer trust his word againe.
            
            
               
               2.Sol.
               
               Mas youle pay him then, tis a great displeasure
               That an elder gun, can do against a cannon,
               Or a subiect against a monarke.
               Youle nere take his word again, your a nasse goe.
            
            
               King.
               Your reproofe is somewhat too bitter:
               Were it not at this time I could be angry.
            
            
               2. Sol.

               How shall I know thee?

               Here is my gloue, which if euer I see in thy hat,
               Ile challenge thee, and strike thee.

               Here is likewise another of mine,

               We haue French quarrels anow in hand:
               We haue no need of English broyles.
            
            
               Kin.
               Tis no treason to cut French crownes,
               For to morrow the king himselfe wil be a clipper.
            
            Exit the souldiers.
            Enter the King, Gloster, Epingam, and Attendants.

               Take from them now the sence of rekconing,
               That the apposed multitudes which stand before them,
               May not appall their courage.
               O not to day, not to day ô God,
               Thinke on the fault my father made,
               In compassing the crowne.
               I Richards bodie haue interred new,
               And on it hath bestowd more contrite teares,
               Then from it issued forced drops of blood:
               A hundred men haue I in yearly pay,
               
                  Which euery day their withered hands hold vp
               To heauen to pardon blood,
               And I haue built two chanceries, more wil I do:
               Tho all that I can do, is all too litle.

               And turne them out of seruice. If they do this,
               As if it please God they shall,
               Then shall our ransome soone be leuied.

                  Alexander the big was borne?

               Flew.
               Why I pray, is nat big great?
               As if I say, big or great, or magnanimous,
               I hope it is all one reconing,
               Saue the frase is a litle varation.
            
            
               Gour.
               I thinke Alexander the great
               Was borne at Macedon.
               
               His father was called Philip of Macedon,
               
               As I take it.
            
            
               Flew.
               
                  I thinke it was Macedon indeed where Alexander
               
               Was borne: looke you captaine Gower,
               
               And if you looke into the mappes of the worell well,
               You shall finde litle difference betweene
               
                  Macedon and Monmorth. Looke you, there is
               A Riuer in Macedon, and there is also a Riuer
               In Monmorth, the Riuers name at Monmorth,
               
               Is called Wye.
               But tis out of my braine, what is the name of the other:
               But tis all one, tis so like, as my fingers is to my fingers,
               And there is Samons in both.
               Looke you captaine Gower, and you marke it,
               
                  You shall finde our King is come after Alexander.
               
               God knowes, and you know, that Alexander in his
               Bowles, and his alles, and his wrath, and his displeasures.
               And indignations, was kill his friend Clitus.
               
            
            
               Gower.
               
                  I but our King is not like him in that,
               For he neuer killd any of his friends.
            
            
               Flew.
               Looke you, tis not well done to take the tale out
               Of a mans mouth, ere it is made an end and finished:
               I speake in the comparisons, as Alexander is kill
               His friend Clitus: so our King being in his ripe
               Wits and iudgements, is turne away, the fat knite
               With the great belly double: I am forget his name.

               Oreviewd them: pleaseth your Grace,
               To let some of your Counsell sit with vs,

               Hate.
               Now Kate, you haue a blunt wooer here
               Left with you.
               If I could win thee at leapfrog,
               Or with vawting with my armour on my backe,
               Into my saddle,
               Without brag be it spoken,
               Ide make compare with any.
               But leauing that Kate,
               
               If thou takest me now,
               Thou shalt haue me at the worst:
               
                  And in wearing, thou shalt haue me better and better,
               Thou shalt haue a face that is not worth sun-burning.
               But doost thou thinke, that thou and I,
               Betweene Saint Denis,
               
               And Saint George, shall get a boy,
               That shall goe to Constantinople,
               
               And take the great Turke by the beard, ha Kate?
            
            
               Kate.
               Is it possible dat me sall
               Loue de enemie de France.
               
            
            
               Harry.
               No Kate, tis vnpossible
               You should loue the enemie of France:
               
               For Kate, I loue France so well,
               That Ile not leaue a Village,
               Ile haue it all mine: then Kate,
               
               When France is mine,
               And I am yours,
               Then France is yours,
               And you are mine.
            
            
               Kate.
               I cannot tell what is dat.
            
            
               Harry.
               No Kate,
               
               Why Ile tell it you in French,
               Which will hang vpon my tongue, like a bride
               On her new married Husband.
               Let me see, Saint Dennis be my speed.
               Quan France et mon.
            
            
               Kate.
               Dat is, when France is yours.
            
            
               Harry.
               Et vous ettes amoy.
            
            
               Kate.
               And I am to you.
            
            
               Harry.
               Douck France ettes a vous:
            
            
               Kate.
               Den France sall be mine.
            
            
               Harry.
               Et Ie suyues a vous.
            
            
               Kate.
               And you will be to me.
            
            
               Har.
               Wilt beleeue me Kate? tis easier for me
               To conquer the kingdome, thē to speak so much
               More French.
            
            
               
               Kate.
               A your Maiesty has false France inough
               To deceiue de best Lady in France.
               
            
            
               Harry.
               No faith Kate not I. But Kate,
               
               In plaine termes, do you loue me?
            
            
               Kate.
               I cannot tell.
            
            
               Harry.
               No, can any of your neighbours tell?
               Ile aske them.
               Come Kate, I know you loue me.
               And soone when you are in your closset,
               Youle question this Lady of me.
               But I pray thee sweete Kate, vse me mercifully,
               Because I loue thee cruelly.
               That I shall dye Kate, is sure:
               But for thy loue, by the Lord neuer.
               What Wench,
               A straight backe will growe crooked.
               A round eye will growe hollowe.
               A great leg will waxe small,
               A curld pate proue balde:
               But a good heart Kate, is the sun and the moone,
               And rather the Sun and not the Moone:
               And therefore Kate take me,
               Take a souldier: take a souldier,
               Take a King.
               Therefore tell me Kate, wilt thou haue me?
            
            
               Kate.
               Dat is as please the King my father.
            
            
               Harry.
               Nay it will please him:
               Nay it shall please him Kate.
               
               And vpon that condition Kate Ile kisse you.
            
            
               Ka.
               O mon du Ie ne voudroy faire quelke chosse
               Pour toute le monde,

               Fashion in Frannce, for the maydes to kis
               Before they are married.
