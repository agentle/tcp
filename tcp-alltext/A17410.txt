               ❧ TO THE
NOBLE AND
Religious Lady, the Lady
MARIE VERE, increase
of ioy and peace
in Beleeuing.
            
               MADAM,
            
            
               IT was most
truely said by
the Apostle of
the Gentiles:
godlines is great
gaine; Importing thereby,

that if man would be incited
to the care to get any
thing, for the profit might
come thereby, it should be
godlinesse: No skill in the
world being c̄oparable to
that skill of being able to
leade a godly life, for the
sure, and speedy, & matchlesse
gain it will bring vnto
a man: for besides that it
onely hath the promise of
a better life, godlinesse
were to bee desired, and
with all possible diligence
to bee sought after, for the
very gaine of it in this life:
For to omit the consideration
of the fauor it breeds
with God, & the vnspeakable

treasures of the grace
of Christ, which alwayes
go with it, it were to bee
desired for the immediate
effects it workes vpon men
in it selfe. For if men loue
themselues, what should
they desire more then that
which tends to make themselues
perfect? What
should it aduantage a man
to haue all things good about
him, if himselfe
bee ill and vile? If men,
that were onely guided by
the light of Nature, could
(some of them) see cleerely,
that nothing was so
good for a man as to liue
well (when yet they knew

no other liuing well, then
what was prescribed in
their naked and naturall
Ethickes) then how much
more happy must it be for
a man to liue a religious
life, by which he is brought
more neerer to God, himselfe,
and farre aboue the
condition of any naturall
man? Yea, if there were
no more to bee had by it,
but the peace and rest it
brings vnto a mans heart,
it were aboue all outward
things to bee desired: for
no man walkes safely, that
walkes not religiously, nor
can any actions of men
produce any sound tranquillity

and rest of heart,
but such actions as are prescribed
by true Religion.
What shall I say? If for
none of these, yet for it self
were a godly life to be had
in singular request: for if
men, with much expence
of outward things, seeke
but the skill of diuers, naturall,
and artificiall knowledges,
and thinke it worth
their cost but to bee able
to attaine these Skils? how
much more ought man to
be at the paines, yea and
cost too (if it were required)
to get this admirable
skill to liue a religious life?
This most gainefull Subiect

is intreated of in this
little Volume; I may truely
say, that almost euery
sentence in this little Treatise,
leads vs to much and
rich treasure, if the promises
belonging to each
duty were annexed thereunto:
and therefore no
Christian that loues his
owne soule, should thinke
much of the paines of learning,
or practising these
Rules.
            I shall not need to exhort
your Ladiship to the
hearty care of those things
you haue beene taught of
God (long since) to profit,
and haue learned Iesus

Christ as the truth is in
him: your sincere profession
and practice hath many
Witnesses: and since
you beleeued the Gospell
of saluation, and were
sealed by the Spirit of promise,
you haue a Witnesse
within your selfe, which
will not faile in life or
death to pleade your
aboundant consolation.
When I entreat of piety,
righteousnesse, mercy and
temperance, I entreate of
things you haue aboue
many profited in.
            I haue presumed to dedicate
these Directions to
your Ladiship, and not

without reason: you haue
heard the preaching of
them with speciall attention,
and haue beene a
principall perswader to
haue them published for
the common good, being
many wayes bound to acknowledge
your Ladiship
amongst my best Hearers
and Friends. I cannot but
beseech your Ladiship to
accept of this small testimony
of my vnfeigned
obseruance of your many
prayses in the Gospel, and
as a pledge of my thankefulnesse
for all your workes
of loue to me and mine.
The God of glory, and

Father of our Lord Iesus
Christ, make you abound
yet more and more, in all
the riches of his grace in
this life, and fill you with
the comforts of the blessed
hope of the appearing of
Iesus Christ.
            
               Your Ladiships in the
seruice of Iesus Christ,
to be euer commanded,

               THVS of the generall
Rules; the particular
Rules concerne either God,
or other men, or our selues.
               Our whole duty to God concernes
either his loue, or
his seruice.
               The loue of God must be considered,
either in the foundation
of it, or in the exercise
of it.
               The foundation of the loue of
God, is the knowledge of
God.
               The Rules about the knowledge
of God, concerne either
the right conceiuing
of his Nature, or our

acquaintance with God.
That we may conceiue aright
of the Nature of God:

                     1. Wee must cast out all
likenesses.
                     2. Wee must striue to conceiue

to his speciall prayses
in his Word.
                     3. We must bring with vs
the faith of the Trinity.
                     4. We may helpe our selues

                     5. Wee must get cure for
Atheisticall thoughts,
                  
               
               That we may be acquainted
with God.

                     1. We must prepare our harts.
                     
                        2. Wee must begge acquaintance
by prayer, praying
with all our hearts, and
earely and constantly.
                     3. We must giue our selues

               Chap. 6. p. 95. to 121.
               THVS of the foundation
of the loue of God: the
Rules that concerne the
exercise of our loue to God,
either shew vs how to manifest
our loue to God, or
how to preserue it.
               Wee manifest our loue to God:

                     1. By auouching him to be
our God.
                     2. By prouiding him a

place to dwell with vs.
                     3. By louing Iesus Christ.
                     4. By walking with him,
which hath fiue things
in it.
                     5. By honouring God: and
wee honour him;

                           By seeking his Kingdome
first.
                           By open profession of his
Truth.
                           By grieuing for his dishonour.
                           By directing all our actions
to his glory.
                           By suffering for his sake.
                           By honoring such as feare
him.
                           By hating his enemies.
                           By speaking of his Truth

with all reuerence.
                           By free-will-offerings.
                           By praysing him: where
diuers Rules.
                        
                     
                     6. By trusting in him: and
this trust in God we shew:

                           By relying vpon his mercy
for our saluation.
                           By committing all our
workes to his blessing.
                           By beleeuing what he saith
                           By staying vpon him in
all distresses, praying to
him, and casting our
care vpon him, and relying
vpon his helpe,
                           Without leaning to our
vnderstanding:
                           Without murmuring,
                           Without feare,
                           
                              Without care,
                           Without vsing ill meanes.
                        
                     
                     7. By obeying him.

                           In the manner also of our manifesting
our loue to God, we
must doe it,

                                 1. With feruency.
                                 2. With feare: and our feare
of God we shew,

                                       By awful thoughts of God.
                                       By departing from euill.
                                       By all reuerence of minde.
                                       By not fearing men.
                                       By remembring his presence.
                                       By trembling at his iudgments.
                                       By humility in the vse

                                       First, when the trespasse is secret, reprooue
him priuatly: if he mend not, reprooue
him before witnesse: if hee yet mend
not, make the Church acquainted with
it: if he will not then amend, hold
him as a Heathen, or a Publican.
                                       
                                          Secondly, if he repent, forgiue him, as often
as he saith, It repenteth him.

               Fiue things to be done in the time of affliction:

                     1. We must pray, and call vpon the
Name of the Lord.
                     2. We must beare our crosse with patiience
and contentation.
                     3. We must vse all good meanes for
our deliuerance.
                     4. We must be sure to shew our trust in
God, & cast our burthen on the Lord
                     5. We must shew our obedience to God.
foure waies:

                           First, by submitting our selues to Gods
will.
                           Secondly, if we iudge our selues, and acknowledge
our sinnes to God.
                           Thirdly, if wee bee constant in the good
wayes of godlinesse.
                           Fourthly, if we learne more righteousnes,
and are made by our crosses to do holy
duties with better affections.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            CHAP. I.
            Containing the Preface,
which shewes the drift,
warrant, profit, and vse
of the ensuing Treatise.
            
               THE onely
thing intended
in this Treatise
is,The scope to collect for
thy vse (Christian Reader)
those directions scattered
here & there in the Scriptures,

which may, through
out the whole course of
thy life, tell thee, what thou
must do in the right order
of thy conuersation: How
thou shouldst behaue thy
selfe toward God, and how
thou shouldst carry thy
selfe toward men, in all the
occasions of thy life: In
company, out of company:
In all duties either of righteousnesse
or mercy: and
how thou shouldst dispose
of thy selfe in affliction, and
out of affliction, at all times.
            And thou maist be the
more encouraged to study
and practise these rules,Thy warrant. because
thou hast the most

expresse & apparant word
of God to warrant and require
thy obedience herein.
            Be not so prophane, as
to thinke, that here is more
to do then needs, or that
I burthen the liues of
Christians with a multitude
of vnnecessary Precepts,
and so make the
way harder then it is: For
I require thy obedience in
nothing, thou hast not
reason to be perswaded to
bee enioyned thee by the
pure word of God; And
thou must know, to the
confusion of thy security;
that hee that will walke

safely, must walke by rule,
Gal. 6. 16. Hee is yet in
darkenesse, and walkes on in
darkenesse, and sees not
what he doth, or whither
hee goeth, that doth not
make the Word of God the
light vnto his feet, and the
Lanterne vnto his pathes:
Psal. 119. There is a holy
order of life commended
in the godly, Col. 2. 5. and
Gods promises are made
to such as will dispose of
their waies aright. A loose
conuersation is an ill conuersation;
and if euer we
would see the saluation of
God, wee must bee at the
paines to dispose of our

waies, and to see to it, that
we dispose of our waies aright,
Psal, 50. vlt.
            
            The benefite thou maist
reape by this Treatise,The profit of the course. is
much euery way, if the
fault bee not in thy selfe:
for here thou maist briefely
behold the substance of
a godly life; thou maist in
a short time informe thy
knowledge in that great
doctrine of practicall Diuinity:
But especially thou
maist, by the help of this
Treatise see a sound way,
how to beautifie thy owne
conuersation, with the addition
of diuers rules,
which, perhaps, hitherto

thou hast not taken notice
of: God hath promised
much peace, and comfort
vnto such as will walke according
vnto rule, Gal. 6. 16.
Yea, hee hath promised,
that they shall see the saluation
of God, that dispose their
way aright, Psal. 50. vlt. It
is true, it is a greater labour
to trauaile in the way,
then to shew it; but yet
it is a great benefite to be
shewed the way. Howsoeuer,
it may not be denied,
but it is a greater glory to
obserue these rules, then to
know them, or prescribe
them.
            It may be thou wilt obiect,The easines of the course.
               
that the rules are so
many, thou canst neuer remember
them, and so not
profite by them. I answer:
            If I haue made the
rules no more in number
then God hath made them
in his Word, thou maist
not finde fault with me.
            Secondly, no man that
is to learne any Trade, or
Science, but hee meeteth
with more directions, then
hee can on the suddaine
reach to, or practise, and
yet hee reiects not his
Trade or Science, because
in time he hopes to learne
it all. Would we put on a
resolution to serue a Prentiship

to Religion, and to
worke hard one whole seuen
yeeres: oh, what work
would we dispatch! How
many Rules and Knowledges
would wee grow
skilfull in! But alas, after
many yeeres profession of
Christianity, the most of
vs, if all were put together,
haue not done the worke,
that might haue bene done
in few daies.
            Thirdly,Marke this direction. I answer, that
it is not necessary thou
shouldst lay all these Rules
before thee at once, but
marke out certaine choise
Rules, so many as thou
canst well remember, and

striue, by daily practice, to
bring thy selfe to some
kinde of dexterity in obseruing
them. There bee
some rules of each kinde,
which, if thou bee a true
Christian, thou knowest
and obseruest already:
These thou maist continue
to obserue still, without
loading thy memory about
them. Now if those
be omitted, then consider
of the rest that remaine,
which of them do most
concerne thee, or would
most adorne thy practice
and profession, or are such
as thou neuer hitherto
didst make conscience of:

Extract or marke out so
many of those at a time, as
thou wouldst in daily
practice striue to attaine,
and when thou hast learned
them, then go on, and
prescribe to thy selfe new
Lessons. To a carnall
minde, all the way of godlinesse
is impossible, but
to a godly and willing
minde all things, through
the power and assistance of
God, are possible: God
will accept thy desire and
endeuour, and will adde
strength and might, and
encourage thee in all his
waies. By prayer thou
maist forme any grace in

thee, by reason of the
power the Lord Iesus hath
to preuaile for any thing
thou dost aske the Father
in his name.
            The last benefite may
come to thee, if thou daily
reade these directions,
is, that they will quicken
thee to a great care of weldoing,
and giue thee cause
to walke humbly with thy
God, and abase thy selfe
for thine owne insufficiency:
The Lord giue thee vnderstanding
in all things,
and vnite thy heart vnto
his feare alwaies, that thou
maist obserue to doe, as hee
commandeth thee, and

not turne from the good way
all the daies of thy life.
            
         
         
            CHAP. II.
            Containing such Rules as in
generall men must take
notice of, as preparations
and furtherances to a
godly life.
            THE Rules of holy
life may bee cast into
two rankes:The rules of life are either generall or particular. the first containing
such rules as are
Generall: and the other,
such as are Particular.
               The generall rules concerne either, The helps to a godly life▪
               
            
            The generall rules are
likewise of two sorts: some
of them concerne certain

               generall preparations, helpes,
or furtherances to a holy
life, without which men
in vaine beginne the cares,
or endeuours of a reformed
life: And some of
them comprehend those
necessary rules which are
to be obserued in the manner
of doing all holy duties,Or secondly, the manner of wel-doing
and so are of singular
vse to bee alwaies remembred,
when wee go
about any seruice.
            Of the first sort there
are many rules;Whoso will address himselfe to a holy course of life. for they
that will addresse themselues
to order their conuersation
aright, must be
soundly carefull in the obseruation

of these directions
following.
            1 He must examine himselfe
about his faith and repentance;
hee must bee sure
hee is reconciled to God,
and hath truely repented
himselfe of his sinnes,
2. Cor. 13. 5. For vnlesse hee
bee a new creature, hee is
no creature, but a dead man,
and so vtterly vnable for
the practice of these rules
following: And without
God we can do nothing; and
without God we are, till
we liue by faith: Besides,
the pollution of our hearts
or liues drawne vpon vs by
the custome of sinne past

and present, will so infect
all we do, that it will bee
abominable to God, and
so lost labour.
            This is the first Rule.
            2 His next care must
be to learne the knowledge
of the rules of life; wee
can neuer practise what
we know not, and therefore
our next care and
paines must be to get the
knowledge of Gods waies
distinctly, and effectually,
into our heads and hearts;
Our direction must not be
in our bookes, but in our
heads; and a Christian
must haue his rules alwaies
before him, that so hee

may walke circumspectly by
line and leuel, Ephes. 5. 15.
vnderstanding the will of
God in what hee is to doe.
He is in the way of life, that
hath and keepeth instruction,
how to liue, Prou. 10.
17. whereas he that will not
be at the paines of getting
instruction, erreth, as Salomon
saith: And therefore
wee must take fast hold of
instruction, and not let her
goe, but keep her: for shee is
our life, Prou. 4. 13. Knowledge
then, of necessity
must be had, or in vaine we
go about to liue well. Now
this is such a rule, as must
not slightly bee passed ouer,

and it is not enough
thus in generall to require
knowledge, but withall, I
would shew certain choice
rules to be obserued by vs,And hee that would prosper in seeking knowlege must obserue nine Rules.
if wee would take a sound
course to attaine knowledge.
He then that would
prosperously seeke sound
knowledge, must remember
these directions.
            First,1. He must esteeme knowlege. hee must esteeme
knowledge, and labour to
frame his heart to a high
estimation of it, accounting
it as great treasure, accounting
the getting of wisdome
aboue all gettings, Pro.
4. 7. We must seek for knowledge,
as for siluer, & search

for her, as for treasure, and
then with wonderfull successe
shall wee vnderstand
the right feare of the Lord,
Prou. 2. 4. else our labour
will bee blasted and fruitlesse,
if wee bring meane
thoughts to the exercise of
directions for the attaining
of knowledge.
            Secondly,2. He must not consult with flesh and bloud. he must take
heede that hee consult not
with flesh and bloud, Gal. 1. 16
He must not regard other
mens opinions, or his own
carnall reason, but resolue
to giue glory to God and his
Word, as willing to beleeue
or doe whatsoeuer the
Lord saith vnto him.
            
               3.3. He must redeeme the time. Thirdly, he must redeeme
the time, Ephes. 5. 16.
Inasmuch as he hath lost so
much time past, hee must
now prouide to allow himselfe
conuenient and certaine
time to be spent this
way for the attaining of
knowledge, else to study
by snatches and vncertainly,
will bee to little or no
purpose. To complaine of
ignorance, will not serue
the turne, nor will the pretence
of worldly businesse
excuse vs: and therefore
we must buy so much time of
our occasions, as may bee
competent for the supply
of our wants in knowledge.
            
               4.4. He must be wise for himselfe. Fourthly, in seeking
knowledge, he must be wise
for himselfe, Prou. 9. 12. He
must striue to vnderstand
his owne way, so to be carefull
to know the generals about
religion, as his speciall
care bee in all things to
referre what hee reades or
heares, to the particular directions
of his owne soule.
This is a rule of singular
Vse, if it could bee beaten
into mens heads, and for
want of this, many Christians,
after long paines, &
much time spent, haue bin
found exceeding ignorant.
            5.5. He must be swift to heare. Hee must be swift to

heare, Iam. 1. 19. with all
frequency and attention,
making vse of the publike
Ministry, striuing with his
owne heart against deadnesse,
and drowsinesse, and
remouing al impediments
might bee cast in his way
from the world, or his
worldly occasions, obseruing
all opportunities for
hearing, especially when
hee seeth the heart of his
Teacher enlarged, and the
power of Doctrine more
then at other times, or in
other things.
            6.6. He must study only profitable things. Sixtly, he must auoid
vaine questions, and fruitles
contemplations, Titus. 3. 9.

1. Tim. 6. 20. 2. Tim. 2. 23.
When the light of doctrin
was so great in the Primitiue
times, this was one
practice of Sathan, to draw
aside the studies of Christians
from necessary and
solid truths, to Genealogies
or quarrels about words or
vaine controuersies, falsly
called oppositions of science:
We must therfore be warned
of this method of Sathan,
& till we know cleerly
the wayes of life, allow
our selues no time for
more remote studies, or
fruitlesse Controuersies.
What riches of knowlege
might some Christians

haue attained to, if they
had spent the time (they
haue imployed about con
               
                  •
               rouersies,
genealogies, &
generall knowledge) in the

                  •
               ound building of themselues
vp in such things, as
their soules apparantly
stand in need of?
            Seuenthly,7. He must striue to increase in knowlege. hee must not

                  •
               est satisfied with a small
measure of vnderstanding;
hee must not giue ouer
when he hath gotten a little
knowledge more then
he had: hee must desire to
increase in knowledge, and
neuer be well pleased with
himselfe, while he is but a
Child in vnderstāding, 1. Cor.
14. 20.
            
               8.8. He must propound his doubts Eightly, Hee must
inquire and take counsell, he
must propound his doubts
daily and carefully. Hee
that would know much,
must aske much, hee must
breake off that wretched
silence he is prone to, and
prouide, if it bee possible,
to enioy the fauor of some
one or moe, that are able
to resolue his doubts from
time to time. This rule
hath incredible profit in it,
if it bee rightly practised,
Prou. 15. 12. & 20. 17, 18.
& 27. 9.
            Ninthly,9. He must be rightly ordered towards his Pastor. and lastly: He
must bee rightly ordered in
respect of his Pastor. For the

principal meanes of knowledge
is assigned of God
to be in the Ministry of his
seruants: and therefore if
wee would attaine knowledge,
we must dispose our
selues aright towards our
Teachers, and to this end
we must looke to it,
            First,1. To pray for him. that wee pray for
them, that their word may
run and haue free passage, &
that God wold make them
able to open vnto vs the mysteries
of his will, 2. Thes. 3.
1. 2. Colos. 4. 3. Ephes. 6. 19.
            Secondly,2. To obey him. we must keep
their directions, and make
conscience of it to be carefull
to obey them, in what

they command vs in the
Lord, 1. Cor. 11. 2.
            Thirdly, wee must take
heed of discouraging them.
For this is not profitable for
vs. For the more cheerefull
and comfortable their
hearts are, the more apt
they are to finde out profitable
things for vs, Heb. 13.
18. 1. Cor. 16. 10, 11.
            And thus of the first and
second rule.
            Thirdly, hee that would
redresse his waies aright,The third rule.
must get out of the way of
wicked men:
               Hee must get out of euill company. He must giue
ouer euill company, and
sequester himselfe from the
counsell and society of carnal

and prophane persons.
The necessity of this rule is
both proued and vrged in
these & many other Scriptures,
Prou. 4. 14. Psal. 1. 1.
2. Cor. 6. 17. Epb. 5. 7, 8.
            Fourthly,4. He must resolue to practise. he must bring
a minde full of care & desire,
and resolution to practise
the rules, when hee
hath learned them: he must
as the phrase is, obserue to
doe Gods will, Deut. 5. 32.
Hee must be watchfull and
diligent, hee must ponder
vpon the waies of God, bewaring
lest hee eyther neglect
or forget to doe them, Deut.
6. 17. & 31. 46. & 8. 11.
1. Corin. 16. 13. Prou. 4. 26.

we must follow after righteousnesse,
1. Tim. 6. 11. and
binde directions as signes
vpon our hands, &c. Deut.
8. 28. If wee could be thus
awakened, this rule would
breed vs vnspeakable good
in our conuersation.
            Fiftly,5. He must settle his outward estate. he must endeuor
to settle his head and his estate
in respect of his worldly
affaires. It is a singular
helpe to godlinesse, to reduce
our outward callings
into order, and euery daies
experience shewes, that
confusions in worldly businesse
breede miserable
neglect in Gods seruice.
And therefore hee that

would profite in an orderly
course of life, must
prouide to vse the world
so, as he may serue the Lord
without distraction: Hee,
that would runne a race,
abstaineth from all things,
that might encumber him.
No man, that warreth, intangleth
himselfe with the
affaires of life, that hee may
please him, who hath chosen
him to be a souldier: And
therefore we may not think
it much, if in our spirituall
course God lay some restraint
vpō vs, in respect of
the cares and encumbrances
in our outward Callings,
1. Cor. 7. 29. 35. &c.

2. Tim. 2. 4. 1. Cor. 9. 28.
            Sixthly,6. He must keep company with the godly. He must walke
in the way of good men, both
setting before him their
practice, as patternes of
imitation, as also by conuersing
with them, that
thereby he may gather encouragement,
and help in
well-doing. Hee is deceiued,
that thinkes to goe
alone, and yet go prosperously
in the course of a
godly life: Hee may profit,
and learne by many things
he heareth, receiueth, and
seeth among the godly.
Prou. 2. 20. Phil. 4. 8, 9.
            Seuenthly,7. He must not be the seruant of men. Hee must
not bee the seruant of men,

1. Cor. 7. 23. other mens humours
must not be the direction
of this practice: He
must so depend vpon persons
he hopes to get any
thing by in this world, as
hee be not thereby hindred
in workes of Religion,
knowing, that he is Christs
Free-man.
            
            Hee must haste to,8. He must looke for the comming of Christ. and
looke for the comming of Iesus
Christ, 2. Pet. 3. 12. Hee
must often remember his
latter end, and daily set before
his eies the comming
of Christ, striuing to stirre
vp in his heart the desire
after Chrst, praying for it,
and dispatching those

workes, that may prepare
him thereunto: The remembrance
of our accounts
in the day of Christ
will wonderfully quicken
men to the care of well,
doing, and the cause of
the viciousnesse, and miserable
neglect, and procrastinations
of many is,
their forgetting of their
latter end: A great reason,
why the directions about
godlinesse are not entertained,
is, because men
put farre away from them
the day of the Lord: whereas
the remembrance of the
reuelation of Iesus Christ,
would put Spirit and Life

into vs. Hee dares not
say from his heart, Come,
Lord Iesus, come quickly,
that is not resolued diligently
to worke the works
of Christ.
            9 He must not stay for
company,9 He must notregard what the multitude doth. but rather
choose to runne alone; or
with a few, then hazzard
the losse of the Crowne.
Our life is a Race, and as
in a race men stay not for
company, but striue who
may runne formost: so it
is in the race of godlinesse:
He must so runne, as he may
obtaine: He must set out
with the first, and runne
as it were for his life: As

he must make vse of the society
of the godly, so hee
must not stay, till his carnall
friends, and acquaintance
will set out with him:
Hee must bee of Ioshua's
minde, that if the whole
world will liue in wickednesse
and prophanenesse,
yet he and his house will serue
the Lord, 1. Cor. 9. 24. & 14.
12. Iosh. 24. 15.
            Tenthly,10. Hee must in all things giue thanks. hee must in all
things giue thankes; when
God giues him successe in
any thing, or prospers the
meanes to him, and helps
him with victory ouer any
sinne, or strength to performe
any duety, or bestowes

vpon him any spirituall
blessing, hee must remember
to praise God in the
name of Iesus Christ. This
will quicken him: Daily
thankfulnesse will breed
daily alacrity in wel-doing:
Hee that will not be thankfull
for beginnings of successe
in the practice of holy
duties, will not hold out:
This is the speciall will of
Christ, that wee should in all
things giue thankes, 1. Thess.
5. 18.
            He must study to be quiet,11. Hee must study to bee quiet.
and follow peace with all
men, meddling with his own
businesse, and auoiding all
occasion of contention,

that might distract him in
his owne course: A busybody
is as good as no body
in respect of sound progresse
in sanctification: It
is an excellent skill to bee
able to auoide the intanglements
of discord; especially
hee must prouide
to haue perfect peace
with the godly. Though
GOD bee able to sanctifie
the oppositions of
vnreasonable men, yet
wee must take heed of
drawing needlesse troubles
vpon our selues; for
that makes vs neither to
be, nor to be accounted
the more holy, but contrariwise.

The Apostle
could not speake vnto the
Corinthians, as vnto spirituall
men, but as vnto
carnall; at the best, but
Babes in Christ; and the
reason was, because there
was strife and enuy, and
diuision amongst them,
Romanes 9. 19. Hebrewes
12. 14. Marke 9. vlt. I.
Cor. 3. 3.
            
               His eyes must looke
straight,12. Hee must keep a strict course in following onely profitable things. and his eye-liddes
right before him, Prou. 4. 25.
Hee must take heed of going
about, and fetching of
compase in Religion, Ier.
31. 32. Hee must bee
still aiming at the marke

of the high prize of his calling:
being sure that the
things hee employeth himselfe
in, tend directly to
the furtherance of his saluation,
and not lose his
time in vnprofitable studies,
or practices, proceeding
from one degree to
another, till hee come to a
ripe age in Christ.
            13.13. Hee must bee conuersant daily in the reading of the holy Scriptures He must bee conuersanrt
in the Scriptures, &
bee familiarly acquainted
with them, that they may
dwell plenteously in him: For
those good words of God
haue not onely light in
them to direct vs, but
power also to assist vs to do

what they require, and
by the daily reading and
hearing of them, wee shall
bee excited to more care
of well-doing: we must exercise
our selues in the Word
day and night, and neuer
let them depart out of our
hearts, but keep our hearts
still warme, with the heate
that comes from them, neuer
suffering the warmth to
go out through our long
forbearance of the vse of
them, Col. 3. 16. Psal. 1. 2.
Iosh. 8. Isaiah. 8. 16, 20.
            14.14. Hee must keep his first loue. Hee must carefully
perseuer in his first loue, Reu,
2. 4. The Lord is wont at
some times or other, about

the first conuersion of a sinner,
to shew himselfe with
such power in his ordinances,
and to reueale vnto
him such glories in the merits
& gifts of Iesus Christ,
and the happinesse of his
estate in him, that his hart
is thereby fired to a cheerfull
liking of the meanes of
saluation, and of godly persons,
and to a wonderfull
desire after God, and care
to please God. Now hee
that would prosper in a
Christian course, must bee
wonderfully careful to preserue
affection, & this spirituall
loue in his hart, and
watch, against, and resist

the first beginnings of decay,
or coldnesse, or declining
in his heart, and take
heed of suffering his heart
to be drawne away by the
deceitfulnesse of sin, or the
inticements of the world.
            15.15. Hee must couet the best gifts. Hee must couet earnestly
the best gifts, 1. Cor. 12
vlt. There are some duties
in Piety or Mercy, or righteousnesse,
which in respect
of our places do most concerne
vs, and would in a
more speciall manner adorne
our particular profession:
so are there some
gifts which doe aduance
our communiō with God,
and do make vs more profitable

amongst men. Now
these things we should study,
and earnestly labour to
frame our selues to, and to
expresse them more effectually
in our conuersation.
This no doubt is the
reason why the holy Ghost
doth in Scripture make
Catalogues of certain speciall
duties, or graces singled
out from the rest, and
fitted to the conditions of
the people who are written
to: and this would be a singular
aduantage to vs, if
wee also would single out
to our vse some few of the
chiefest vertues or duties
which wee would daily

set before vs, and striue by
prayer and all holy indeuor
to fashion them to life
in our hearts of liues.
            16.16. He must often humble his soule before God. He must renew often
his mortification;
mans heart is like fallow
ground, which is not to receiue
seed, till it be broken
vp, and at best it is like a
garden which will often
need weeding. If we doe
not at some times in speciall
manner humble our
soules before God, worldly
cares, or carnall delights
will ouer-grow our desires
and our practice, & choake
the seed of the Word receiued
by vs; we must keep

vnder our bodies, & bring
them in subiection, and
be often dragging our lusts
to the crosse of Christ,
there to crucifie them. Our
practice is like to sowing,
which presupposeth plowing
before, Ier. 4. 34. Hosh.
10. 12. 1. Cor. 9. 27.
            17.17. Hee must watch for the opportunities of wel-doing Hee must watch for
the opportunities of well-doing,
and take heed of procrastination:
he must seeke
righteousness, and haste to it,
hee must not put it off, till
to morrow, Esay 16. 5. Pro.
3. 28. & 23. 26. Amos 5. 14.
            18.18. Hee must bee carefull of sāctifying the Sabbath. He must remember
the Sabbath day to sanctifie
it: The commaundement

concerning the keeping of
the Sabbath, to sanctifie it,
is placed in the midst betweene
the two Tables, of
purpose to shew that the
keeping of the Sabbath is
a singular helpe to all piety
& righteousnesse, and God
hath promised a speciall
blessing to the obseruers of
the Sabbath, and giues
strength by the rest of that
day, the better to perform
holy duties all the week after,
Commandement 4.
Esay 58. 13.
            19.19. Hee must often thinke of the example of the godly that haue excelled. Hee must meditate
much on the example of the
godly of all ages, and striue
diligently to learne their

waies, and to quicken himselfe
by the thought of
their care, zeale, and sincerity.
And thus he may also
profitably set before
him the examples of some
of his owne acquaintance,
as excell in the gifts of
Christ, and fruits of well-doing.
The example of
good men should bee as
forcible to draw vs to
good, as the example of
euill men is to incline others
to euill: we haue bin
compassed about with a cloud
of witnesses, who haue liued
in all ages of the Church:
we must therefore stand in
the wayes and see, and aske

for the olde way to walke in
it, and with all gladnesse
follow any that are fit to
bee guides to vs therein,
Hebr. 12. 1. Ierem. 12. 16. &
6. 16.
            20.20. Hee must daily seek a way of God. Hee must goe daily
to him that teacheth to profit,
begging of God to shew
him away, and to lead him
by his Spirit vnto the right
practice of euery holy duty,
euen to guide him in the
plaine path, Esay 48. 17. Psal.
27. 11.
            Thus I haue set downe
those rules which are generall
helpes vnto godlinesse,
and must bee attended
by a godly Christian.
         
         
            
            CHAP. III.
            Shewing the things that are
to be auoyded by such as
would order their conuersation
aright.
            NOw before I proceed
vnto the rules that
concerne the manner of
well-doing. I will adde vnto
the former directions,
nine Cautions,Hee must auoid, or nine
things which a Christian
must take heede of in his
practice of holy duties: As
            1. First, hee must take
heed of wretchlesnesse,
               1. Carelesnesse. or
a scornefull carelesnesse of

his owne waies, he must
not despise his waies:
as if hee cared not how
hee liued, or rested satisfied
to be still, as hee was:
This carelesnesse proues
the bane of many a soule,
whereas Hee that keepeth
his soule, keepeth his way, Pro.
19. 16. & 21. 5.
            2. Hee must take heed
of precipitation,
               2. Rashnes or rashnesse,
or too much haste:
this is the ground of much
false zeale, and the cause of
strange euils in the practice
of some Christians:
but the godly Christian
must learne of Salomon, to
prepare his work in the field,
               
and then build his house: he
must get sound knowledge
of the warrant of his actions,
and guide his affaires
by aduice, and with serious
preparation fit himselfe
to the doing of what
he is sure is good. He that
hasteth with his feet, sinneth:
what is done rashly, cannot
he done well: Prou. 19. 2.
As procrastination is a
great vice; so praecipitation
is no vertue, Prou. 24. 27▪ &
28. 2
                  •
               .
            3 Hee must haue no
confidence in the flesh,
               3. Carnall cōfidence. hee
must not relye vpon his
owne wit, memory, reason,
desires, vertues, prayses, or

power; but all his comfort
and affiance must be in the
merits, intercession, vertue,
presence, and assistance
of Iesus Christ his
Sauiour, Phil. 3. 3.
            4 He must not haste to
be rich,
               4. Haste to be rich. for the desire of money
is the roote of all euill;
and they cannot be at leasure
for good duties, that
are so eager to compasse
great things in the world,
Prou. 23. 4. & 28. 20.
            5 He must take heed of
the snares that arise from
distrustfull feares:
               5. Distrustfull feares. There
is a snare in feare, Prou. 29.
25. There are many feares
will assault a man, that resolues

to liue well; As the
feare that hee cannot doe
good duties; The feare
that God will not accept
what hee doth; The feare
left men should scorne
him, or contemne him, or
lest hee should lose the fauour
of his friends, or such
like. Now against all these
must the godly minde bee
armed, and take heed that
those feares prooue not
great hinderances to him;
and especially take heed of
that vnbeleefe, or counterfet
humility, in disabling
himselfe, or mistrusting
God contrary to his nature
and promises.
            
               6 Hee must take heed
of adding to,
               6. Adding to, or taking from the word of God. 
               or detracting
from the Word of God: Hee
must not imagine more
sinnes, then God hath
made; that is, not trouble
himselfe with feare of offending
in such things, as
God hath not in his Word
forbidden: and so likewise
he must not impose
vpon his owne conscience,
or other mens, the necessity
of obseruing such rules
of practice, as God neuer
prescribed. This caution
would case the hearts of
many Christians, if it were
discreetely obserued and
applied, Prou. 30. 6.
            
               7 Hee must take heed
of hardening his necke against
reproofs:
               7. Contempt of reproofe. 
               Pro. 29. 1. He
must needs▪ run into headlong
euils, that is so proud
as not to heare aduice, or
to reiect reproofes; and it
will bee a singular furtherance
to a holy life, to bee
easie to be entreated to leaue
his offences, and to mend
his errours.
            8 Hee must take heed
of beholding vanity:
               8. Beholding vanitie. 
               Dauid
prayes, that God wold turne
away his eyes from beholding
vanity: He that would
forsake vanity, must auoide
the presence of vaine persons,
and the too much

contemplation of vanity,
shunning the reading and
discourse of the inticements
of others vnto any
sin, Psal. 119. 37.
            9 And lastly,9. The beginning of sinne. hee must
take heed of the beginning
of euils in his owne heart:
hee must keep his heart with
all diligence, for thereout
commeth life: His practice
will be easie to him, if
hee resist sinne in the beginning,
and driue out Sathan
from his holds within his soule, whereas hee
cannot but be much intangled
and encumbred, that
allowes himselfe in the secret
entertainment of contemplatiue

wickednesse; he
must watch his heart, and
striue for inward purity,
Prou. 4. 23.
         
         
            CHAP. IIII.
            Containing the generall
Rules to be remembred in
the manner of doing all
good duties.
            HItherto of the first
sort of generall Rules:
The second sort concerne
the manner of well-doing:There are 9. things to be still remē bred, which cō
                  cerne the manner of wel-doing
There are diuers things in
the generall, which are to
be obserued of the godly
Christian in all good duties,

which hee ought to
haue perfect in his memory,
and such as hee might
bring with him at all times
to forme his heart in respect
of them, to beget in
him that holy manner of
carrying himselfe, which
is requisite vnto the acceptation
of the good things
he employeth himselfe in:
and the rather should hee
bee moued to the care of
learning and expressing of
these things, because the
matter of good duties
may be done by wicked
men, as they were by the
Pharises, and yet all abomination
to the Lord: That

therefore hee may not lose
what he worketh, hee must
striue in euery good action
to expresse these nine
things following in the
manner of his behauiour.
            The first thing required
in the manner of euery holy
duty,1. Zeale, with continual willingnesse and feruencie. is Zeale: It is not
enough that hee doe the
dutie, but hee must do it
affectionately, bringing
with him the stirring of the
desires of his heart answerable,
and agreeable to the
duty he would performe:
Zeale hath in it two distinct
things, willingnesse and
feruencie; It must not seeme
euill to him to do Gods

worke, and in doing it, he
must lift vp his heart, so as
he performe it with all his
might, and with all his
soule; and this hee doth,
when either hee brings a
heart delighting in good
workes, or when hee iudgeth
himselfe for what
deadnesse, or distraction,
or vnwillingnesse he findes
in himselfe: He is accounted
zealous, when he striues
for it, and lifts vp his soule
against the impediments
which burthen him: This
zeale is necessary; Christ
died to redeeme a people vnto
himselfe, not onely that
would do good works, but

that would be zealous of
good workes, Tit. 2. 14.
            2 The second thing required
in the manner of
good duties,2. Sincerity, which hath in it 5. things. is sincerity, all
his actions must bee done
in the sincerity of his
heart. The life of a Christian
is like a continuall
Passe-ouer; Now this Feast
hee must keepe alwaies with
the vnleauened bread of sincerity,
1. Cor. 5. 8.
            Now this sinceritie hee
must shew diuers waies, as,
            1 By the truth of his
heart,
               1. Truth. as it stands opposed
to hypocrisie; he must
not talke of well-doing, or
seeme to do it, but he must

doe it indeed.
            2 By his respect to all
Gods commandements,
               2. Respect to al Gods commandements. when
he can say with Dauid, I
esteeme all thy precepts, concerning
all things to be right,
and I hate euery false way.
He that is truly sincere, accounteth
that euery word
of God is good, and desires
to yeeld obedience in
all things. Hee hath not
his reseruations, or exceptions:
He doth not with
Herod giue himselfe liberty
to lie in the wilfull
breach of one commandement,
resting satisfied to
haue reformed himselfe in
other things. As he would

haue God to forgiue him all
his sinnes, so his heart desires
to forsake all sinne, and
so hee desires also to do euery
part of Gods worke.
            3. By propounding the
glory of God,
               3. Right end. as the chiefe
end of all his actions: His
praise must not be of men, nor
must hee doe good duties
for carnall ends, 1. Cor. 10.
31.
            4. By obeying without expostulating,
               4. Obedience without expostulation.
though God
giue no apparant reason of
his commandement. Thus
Abraham shewed his sincerity,
when God bade him
goe out of his owne country,
though hee knew not

whither hee should goe,
Hebr. 11. 8. This is to obey
simply, because God
hath commanded it.
            5 By obeying absent as
well as present,
               5. Obedience in all places. in all companies
as well as one. This praised
the sincerity of the Obedience
of the Philippians,
Phil. 2. 12.
            Thus of sincerity, which
is the second thing required
in the manner of welldoing.
            3. The third thing is
Constancy:
               The third thing required in the māner of well-doing, is Constācy. 
               He is blessed that
doth righteousnesse alwaies.
Doing righteousnesse will
not serue the turne, but it
must be at all times, Psalm.
               
106. 3. Our righteousnesse
must not be like the morning
dew. It is not sufficient to
doe good by fits; wee are
no day laborers, but Gods
hired seruants: Hee that is
righteous, must bee righteous
still, Rom. 6 19. Reuel. 22. 11.
There must be continuance
in well-doing, Rom. 2. 7, 8.
            Now to bee constant in
well-doing,And he is constant, that doth good duties, is to doe good
duties,
            1. Without wearinesse:
               1. Without wearines. It
is required as a thing necessary
to the manner of
well-doing, that we be not
weary of it, and that wee
faint not, Gal. 6. 9. This we
must striue for by prayer.
            
               2. Without discouragement:
               2. Without discouragement.
wee must lift vp the
hands that hang downe, and
the feeble knees, and make
straight steppes to our feete.
How much hinderance to
well-doing, discouragement
is, may appeare by
the similitude: feeble knees
will dispatch but a little
space of the iourney, and
hands that hang down, are
not fit for worke: great is
the hinderance comes to
many by their discouragements
and aptnesse thereunto,
which ariseth vsually
from pride, & the dregs of
worldly sorrow, and ought
much to be resisted by true

Christians, Hebr. 12. 12, 13.
Iosh. 1. 6, 7.
            3. Without impediment:
               3. Notwithstanding impedimēts.
That is, notwithstanding
all the impediments may
be cast in the way; Iudgement
should runne downe
as waters, and righteousnesse
as a flowing streame:
wee should ouercome all
difficulties: you cannot
stop the flowing streame,
though you cast in great
logs or stones, yea though
you would goe about to
damme it vp; and such
should be the resolution of
a godly Christian, Amos
3. 24.
            4. Without wauering or

vncertainty.
               4. Without wauering. It is vncertaine
running the Apostle
implyedly forbids, 1. Cor. 9.
25. Our life is like a race:
Now in a race it is not enough
that a man runne
now and then, though he
runne fiercely for the time:
He must not trifle & looke
behinde, and stand still at
his pleasure, and then run
againe, but he must be alwaies
running: so ought it
to be with vs in the race of
godlinesse. It will not serue
the turne to bee good by
fits, and to bee forward in
good things onely at some
times, and then be careles,
and off the hookes, as wee

say, at other times.
            5. Without declining or
going backe.
               5. Without declining. 
               Iob comforts
himselfe against the aspersion
of hypocrifie by this,
that his foot had held on his
steps, and Gods waies he had
kept, and not declined, nor
had hee gone backe from Gods
Commandements, Iob 23. 11,
12. Though hee had not
made such Progresse as he
desired, yet this was his
comfort, he had not backeslided
by Apostasie.
            And thus of the third
thing also required in the
manner of well-doing,
which is Constancy.
            4.4. Feare. The fourth thing

required is feare: thus Pro.
28. 14. The man is blessed
that feareth alwaies. And 1.
Pet. 1. 17. & 3. 2. Our conuersation
must be with feare:
This feare excludes rudenesse,
carelesnesse, conceitednesse,
pride, & the like,
& includes Reuerence, awfull
regard of Gods holinesse,
or holy presence
(whom wee should set alwaies
before vs) and the
feare of the deceitfulnesse
of sinne, and our own corrupt
dispositions, and the
care to auoyd all occasions
of offending God or
men.
            The fift thing is simplicity.
               Simplicity
               
This is so necessary, as
the Apostle mistrusted
most the subtilty of the
Diuel, in beguiling Christians
of this simplicity, which
they had in Iesus Christ, 2.
Cor. 11. 3.
            Now this simplicity
containes in it distinctly
diuers things.
            1.Which is, 1. To rest vpon the Word for the formes of holines & happinesse. 
               A resting in those forms
of holinesse and happinesse
which God hath prescribed,
when a man desires no
more to make him happy,
then what God hath offered
and giuen in Iesus
Christ, 2. Corin. 11. 3. and
when he accounts nothing
to defile him, but what

God hath forbidden, and
nothing needfull to bee
done by him, but what
God hath in his Word required.
            2. A Doue-like innocency,
               2. To bee harmlesse.
and harmlesnesse, when
the Christian shewes a desire
to bee iniurious to no
man, but rather to seek the
good of others, as well as
his owne, 1. Cor. 10. 24.
            3. An ignorance of the
depths of Sathan,
               3. To bee simple cō
                  cerning euill. and the
methods of sinne, when hee
is not cunning in sinning,
out simple concerning euill,
no way desirous to get subtill
excuses, or arguments

                  •
               o defend himselfe in euill,

               Romanes. 16. 19.
            4.4. To loue goodnesse for it selfe 
               A loue of goodnesse for
it selfe, and hatred of sinne,
as it is sinne.
            5.5. To bee meeke & lowlyminded. 
               Meekenesse of wisedome,
I am. 3. 13. which is
shewed three wayes. 1. By
lowlinesse of minde, when a
man is not conceited, or
wise in himselfe, but retaines
a sence of his owne
vnfitnesse, and vnworthinesse,
Iob 37. 24. 2. By silence
from his owne praises,
Prou. 27. 2. 3. By auoiding
vain ianglings, which
arise out of Enuy, or contempt
of others.
            6.6. Feare God, and not enuy the wicked 
               The preseruing of himselfe
in the feare of God, notwithstanding

the prosperity
of euill doers, not enuying
the wicked, that hath
successe in his way, Prou.
23. 27.
            The sixt thing required
in the manner of well-doing,The sixt is circumspection, which hath fiue things in it.
is Circumspection, Eph.
5. 15.
            Now he walketh circumspectly
or exactly:
            1. That makes conscience
to obserue the lesser
commandement as
well as the greater, Mat.
5. 19.
            2. That abstains from
the very appearance of
euill, 1. Thes. 5. 22.
            3. That with discretiō
               
lookes to the circumstances
of things to bee
done, as time, place, persons,
order, and the like:
that doth not onely doe
good, but is wise to doe
good, Romanes 16. 19.
            4. That liues without
rebuke, and is vnspotted
of the world, Phil.
2. 15. I am. 1. vlt. that is
not guilty of any scandall,
and giues no iust
cause to the wicked to
blaspheme, but prouides
for things honest in the
sight of all men, 2. Cor. 8.
21.
            5. That will not doe
euil, though good might

come of it, Rom. 3.
            The seuenth thing required
in the manner of well-doing,The 7. is, growth or increase.
is growth & increase:
Wee must not onely get
grace and knowledge, and
doe good, but wee must
grow in the grace and knowledge
of Iesus Christ, 2. Pet.
3. 18.Which hath three things in it. & this growth should
haue in it distinctly three
things:
            1.1. Abounding in goodnes. 
               Abounding in good
workes, or a more frequent
practice of all
sorts of duties, that wee
haue opportunity and
power to practise, 1. Cor.
15. 58. Col. 1. 10.
            2.2. Perfecting of holinesse. 
               The perfecting of holinesse,

2. Cor. 7. 1. or the
ripening of our gifts, &
finishing of the good
things we begin, not leauing
off till we haue accomplished
them in
some good measure and
manner.
            3.3. Progress 
               Progresse, so as our
workes bee more at last,
then at first.
            
            And all this we should
striue for, both thth so
our profiting might appeare,
1. Tim. 4. 15. and
we may be fit to be an example
to others,
               2. Tim. 4. 12. 1. Th. 1. 7.
            The eighth thing required
in the manner of well-doing,8. Faith.
is Faith: wee must

               walke by faith in all our actions,
2. Cor. 5. 7. Now faith
is employed partly in taking
notice of Gods will,
as the warrant of our actions,
and partly in ouercomming
the difficulties
of well-doing, making vs
hold out, though wee bee
scorned, or disgraced, or
opposed in the world, and
raising vp our hearts to beleeue
Gods assistance, notwithstanding
our owne
weaknesses, & partly in trusting
God for the successe,
beleeuing Gods promises.
            The ninth & last thing
required in the manner of
wel-doing,The last is moderatiō
                is Moderation.

This rule is expressed in
these words,The place in Eccl. 7. 16. expounded. 
               Eccles. 7. 16.
Be not iust ouer-much, neyther
bee thou wicked ouermuch:
Now for the sense
of these words, wee must
know in the negatiue, that
this place is most prophanely
alleadged by such
as produce it as a reproofe
of strictnesse of life, and the
refusall of the excesses of
the time.
            There are many things
said to giue a sence of those
words.
            1. Some referre these
words to Iustice, eyther
Distributiue, or Commutatiue,
and that eyther in

the case of a priuate person,
or of a Magistrate. A
priuate man must neyther
stand too much vpon his
right, nor yet suffer his innocency
to be too much
wronged. A Magistrate
must not be too seuere in a
selfe-conceited Iustice, nor
yet too remisse in sparing
or fauouring wickednes.
            2. Some thinke it restraines
curiosity and carelesnes,
as if the sence were,
Be not curious to pry or
search into secret things,
that are not reuealed: for
hee that will bee searching
into Gods maiesty, may be
oppressed by his glory: nor

yet be so carelesse, as not to
take notice of the truth reuealed.
            3. Some thus exceed
not by too much precisenesse
on the right hand, or
by too much prophanenes
on the left hand. On the
right hand they goe out,
that bring in workes of supererogation,
and such as
worship God after the precepts
of men, and such as
tye mens consciences to
obserue or auoid things
without warrant of Scripture,
and such as say they
haue no sin, and need not
the grace of God.
            4. Lastly, the fittest interpretation

is theirs, that
expound the words in this
sense, Be not iust ouer-much,
that is, think not too highly
of thy selfe in any thing
thou doest well, nor yet be
wicked ouer-much, that is,
account not too vilely of
thy selfe, denying Gods
gifts in thee, and refusing
the iust comforts thou
shouldest take to thy selfe;
aggrauate not against thy
owne soule thy weakenesse
aboue reason and measure.
         
         
            
            CHAP. V.
            Intreating of the rules that
concerne our carriage towards
God, and in particular
about the knowledge
of God.
            HItherto of the generall
rules:The diuision of the particular rules. The particular
rules that concerne
the right ordering of our
conuersation, may be cast
into three heads, as they
direct vs in our carriage,

                  1. Towards God.
                  2. Towards men.
                  3. Towards our selues.The subdiuision.
                  
               
            
            All the rules that concerne

our duties to GOD,
may bee cast into two
heads: 1. For they concerne
eyther the loue of
God, or 2. the seruice of
God. This is an exact diuision;
for all wee owe to
God, is fitly comprehended
in these two, Loue and
Seruice: and the Scripture
so diuides in these and the
like places, Commandement
2. Deut. 11. 23. & 30.
16. Iosh. 22. 5. Esay 56. 6.
            Now that wee may bee
rightly ordered in respect
of our loue to God, wee
must consider of his loue,
eyther in the foundation
of it, or in the exercise of it.

The foundation of our loue
to God, is the true knowlege
of God, 2. Chron. 28. 6. So
that in the first place wee
must soundly informe our
selues concerning this
knowledge of God.The rules that concerne the right knowlege of God of 2. sorts. Now
the rules that concerne the
right knowledge of God,
concerne eyther the right
conceiuing of his nature, or
our aoquaintance with God,
when wee doe aright conceiue
of him.That wee may conceiue aright of Gods nature. That wee
may conceiue aright of
Gods nature,
            1.1. We must cast out all likenesses. Wee must exclude
out of our thoughts all
likenesses, so as men do not
thinke of God, representing

him by the similitude
of any creature: Hee that
forbids Images of him in
Churches, forbids it also
in our heads, Commandement
2. Esay 40. Deut. 4.
            2. Wee must striue to
conceiue of him according
to his praises declared
by his workes,2. We must conceiue of him according t
                     •
                   his prayses. or in his
Word. This is an excellent,
and easie way to
thinke of God. Since our
hearts cannot conceiue his
Nature, we should fill them
with the impression of his
praises, and according to
them direct our affection,
and seruice to him: As I
would bring this minde to

prayer, or any other seruice
of God, I cannot make any
resemblance of the Diuine
Substance, whom I
am about to serue: yet this
will I do, I will remember
that hee that I pray vnto,
is most wise, most omnipotēt,
most iust, most gracious,
&c. Thus God proclaimes
himselfe by his praises,
Exod. 34. 6. where God
himselfe shewes vs a way
how to conceiue of him.
            33. We must beleeue the Trinity of Persons. Thou must then silence
thy reason, and exalt
thy faith in the point of
the Trinity, which must be
conceiued of necessity, because
all seruice is due to

the whole Trinity: Now
thou needst not striue to
resemble the Trinity in any
likenesse in thy minde, but
onely bring faith to beleeue
that thy God is three
in one.
            
            4.4. Thou maist conceiue of God in the Humane Nature of Christ. It may yet helpe thy
vnderstanding to conceiue,
that God is in Christ,
and the fulnesse of the God-head
dwels in him bodily:
and therefore when thou
commest to worship, thou
maist set before thy minde
the Humane Nature of
Christ, adoring the God-head
in him, as conceiuing
of God in that humane
Nature thou thinkest of,

               Col. 2. 9. Ioh. 17. 3.
            55. Thou must resist Atheistical thoughts. That this may be the
more cleerely and comfortably
done, thou must labour
by sound aduice and
direction, to expell out of
thy head those secret
and rebellious Atheisticall
thoughts, which arise in
thee about his Nature, Decree,
Attributes, or Works:
Men must take heed of
smothering these Obiections,
but seek helpe against
them in time.
            Thus of the knowledge
of God, as it concernes the
right conceiuing of his
Nature.
            There is required further

such a knowledge,2. Of acquaintance with God. as
brings vs acquainted with
God: wee are commanded
to acquaint our selues with
God, Iob. 22. 21, 22.
            Now, because it is an
exceeding hard way for a
mortall man to finde out
God,That thou maist bee acquainted with God. so as to enioy familiarity
with him: Therefore
I will adde some directions
about it: For if
thou wouldst acquaint thy
selfe with God,
            
               1. Thou must prepare thy heart. Thou must prepare
thy heart for this Vision of
God, by driuing out filthy
and vnholy thoughts, and
affections, For without holinesse
no man can see God.

The pure in heart shall see
God, Math. 5. 7. Hebr. 12. 14.
1. Chro. 19. 3. God delights
to shew himselfe familiarly
in a cleane heart.
            2.2. Thou must beg it by prayer. Thou must beg this
acquaintance by prayer: if
thou seeke it of him earnestly,
though God be in
himselfe inuisible to mortall
eyes, yet hee will shew
himselfe to the eies of thy
minde: pray for his acquaintance,
and he will be
acquainted with thee: This
is to aske after the Lord, and
to seeke God: if wee seeke
him, hee will be found, Psal.
105.Three things in seeking aright. 3, 4. But then we must
remember three things;
            
               1 To seeke him with 
our whole hearts, we must
pray with great earnestnesse
and desire.
            2 To seek him earely,
Psalme 119. verse 10.
and while hee may bee
found, God offers acquaintance
in his Ordinances,
and sometimes
comes neere, and knocketh
at mens hearts, and
workes greater impressions
vpon them: Now
if thou wouldst call vpon
God heartily, hee
would shew thee his
presence.
            3 To seeke him constantly;
               
wee must seeke

               his face continnally: both
till we finde it, and after
wee haue had acquaintance
with him, it
must be continued: we
must not thinke much,
if we be put to pray often
and long, before we
attaine such an incomparable
benefit.
            33. Thou must giue thy selfe to God. Thou must giue thy
selfe, soule and body, to
God, seriously, and from
thy heart, deuoting and
promising to spend thy
daies in his seruice, and
then hee will reueale himselfe
vnto thee, Rom. 12. 1, 2.
            4 Thou must waite vpon
his Ordinances, and

watch, how the Lord
speakes vnto thee, either
by his Word, or by his
Spirit. For in them hee
shewes himselfe to men,
and conuerseth with them.
            5 It is a great furtherance
to our acquaintance
with God, to keepe company
with his Houshold;
for with them hee dwels,
and by conuersing with
them we may-occasionally
often see God, 1. Ioh. 3. 6, 7,
8, 12.
            Thus of acquaintance
with God.
            There are other things
to bee further noted concerning
our knowledge ofOther things about our knowlege
               
God, such as these:
            That when we attaine
vnto any acquaintance
with God, we must neuer
rest, till wee know
him to be our God, Col.
2. 2.
            That it must bee our
daily care to increase in
the knowledge of God,
labouring to plant in
our hearts a more large
and affectionate contemplation
of the glories
of Gods Nature & Loue.
            
            That aboue all earthly
things we should glory
in it, if wee attaine
some happy admission
into Gods presence, and

ability to conceiue of
God, and to be acquainted
with him, Ier. 9. 24.
         
         
            CHAP. VI.
            Rules, that order is about the
manifestation of our loue to
God.
            HItherto of the Rules
that concerne the
knowledge of God, as the
foundation of our loue to
God: The rules that should
order vs in the exercise of
our loue to God,Rules about the exercise of our loue to God. follow;
and those are of two sorts:
1. for either they concerne
the manifestation of our

loue: 2. or our preseruation
in the loue of God; wee
must shew our loue to
God, and we must keepe
our selues in the loue of
God, Iude 21.
            In our manifestation of
loue to God, we must look
to both the matter, (as the
things whereby) and also
the manner how we should
expresse our loue to God.
            For the first,Seuen waies to manifest our loue to God. there bee
diuers excellent Rules to
bee heeded of vs in our
practice, in obseruing
whereof we may soundly
prooue the truth of our
loue to God: if wee say
wee loue God, wee must

shew it by these things following.
            1.1. By auouching him to bee our God. Wee must auouch
God to be our God, Deut. 26.
17. and so we doe, if wee
do not onely make choice
of God aboue all things to
set our harts vpon him, but
also maintaine our choyce
by a constant refusall of all
idols in the world, euen all
things which might intice
vs to loue them in stead of
God, by sound affection
and practice declaring our
resolution to cleaue to
God, as our sufficient happinesse,
though all the
world follow their profits,
or pleasures, &c.
            2.
               2. By prouiding him a place to dwell where wee dwell. Wee must prouide
and prepare a place for God,
that he may dwell with vs,
wheresoeuer we dwell, Exo.
15. 2. It is a signe of our
true loue to God, when we
cannot liue without him:
He that can be content to
liue in any place, where he
is not powerfully present in
his ordinances, shewes no
loue to God: It should
be our chiefe care to seate
our selues so in the world,
as the Lord and his presence
may bee prouided
for, that hee may raigne amongst
vs by the Scepter
of his Word.
            3.3. By shewing our loue to Iesus Christ. We shall shew our

loue to God, by our loue to
the Lord Iesus the Sonne of
God: we must kisse the Sun,
Psal. 2. vlt. And if any man
loue not the Lord Iesus, hee
hath not the Father, 1. Cor.
16. 22. We shew that wee
loue God, when we highly
esteeme Iesus Christ, and
make much of him in our
hearts, & striue to fire our
affections toward him; and
this must bee our care
through the passages of
our life, to forme in vs the
loue of the Lord Iesus, that
wee may long after him,
and haue the desires of our
soules after him, and his
comming.
            
               4.4. By walking with God. We must shew our
loue to GOD by walking
with him, Genes. 17. 1. Mica.
6. 8. The Lord doth not account
it a signe of loue to
offer to him a thousand
Rammes, or riuers of oyle.
But this is it that pleaseth
him, To humble our selues to
walke before him.
            
            Now we walk with God
diuers wayes.
            1. When we set the Lord
alwaies before vs,
               Men walk with God 5. waies. remembring
his holy presence, &
not daring to goe long
without thinking of God,
Psal. 16. 18.
            2. When wee nourish
the motions of the Spirit, and

retire our selues of purpose
to entertaine them.
            3. When we daily haue
recourse to those meanes by
which the Lord is pleased
to conuerse with men, and
not rest in the bare vse of
the meanes, but striue to
finde out the Lord in his holy
presence, in euery ordinance
of his, Psal. 63. 1, 2.
            4. Whē we vse our selues
to Soliloquies with God,
taking all occasions to
speake to God by prayer
and priuate meditation of
things offered to vs, out of
which wee could extract
matter for frequent Ciaculations,
lifting vp our hearts

vpon the very first motions
of good vnto God, Psalm.
63. 5, 6.
            5. When our hearts are
fired with longing desires after
his presence of glory in
heauen, 2. Cor. 5. 8.
            Thus of our walking with
God.
            5.5. By honouring God. We should manifest
our loue to God by honouring
him: For this is one
speciall way by which God
requires to haue our loue
shewed to him, Malac. 1. 6.
Now there are many waies
by which in our cōuersation
we may declare our desire
to honor our God:10. Waies of honouring God. As,
            1. By performing the

care of businesses that concerne
his kingdom, aboue al
other businesses, & shewing
our respect of the duties of
the first table, that concern
God, before the duties that
concerne men in the second
table: we honouring
him by seeking his kingdome
first: First (I say) in the precedency
of time, and first, in respect
of the measure of our
affections, Math. 6. shewing
a desire to please him rather
then all the world.
            2. By making a bold &
open profession of GODS
truth vpon all occasions,
without feare of oppositions
or snares of the world.
            
               3. By grieuing heartily
for his dishonours done vnto
him, by the blasphemies
or prophanenesse of his enemies,
Psal. 42. 3.
            4. By directing all our actions
to his glory, striuing in
al the things to order them
so, that some way God may
be praised by vs, or others,
1. Cor. 10. 31.
            5. By our willingnesse to
suffer any thing for his sake,
though it were extremities,
euen the losse of all
worldly things, yea and
life it selfe, if wee were called
to it.
            6. By honoring them that
feare his name, and are begotten

of him, and beare his
Image, receiuing them, &
making much of them, and
defending them for the
loue we beare to God himselfe,
Psalm. 15. 1. Ioh. 5. 1.
            7. By hating them that
are his enemies, as if they
were our own, conceiuing
more dislike of them for
dishonouring God, then
for any wrongs they could
do vnto vs, Psal. 139. 21, 22.
            8. Wee honour God,
when we speak of the Oracles
of God with alreuerence
as may become the nature
and glory of them, Commandement
3. 1. Pet. 4. 11.
            9. We honour him by

gifts bestowed vpon him,
when we bring to him our
free-will offerings, such as
are the first fruites of all
our increase, when out of
all things wherein God
hath prospered vs, we with
gladnes consecrate a part
for the furtherance of his
worship, or the maintenance
of his poore: Prou. 3.
6. Esay 60. 6.
            10. Wee honour him,
when we praise him. One vsuall
way by which we honour
great persons in the
world, is by taking all occasions
to magnifie them,
by commending their vertues,
or their worthy Acts:
               
And this is likewise one
great way of honouring
God: & therefore with sorrow
for our neglects herein,
we should study his praises
for the time to come,
and striue for language to
be able readily to doe so.
            Now God is praised diuers
wayes.Rules about the praise of God. Some of them
belong not properly to
this place, and therefore I
will but touch them.
            
               We praise God.
            
            1. When we keepe and
obserue carefully the solemnities
set apart for his
praise, as when wee celebrate
the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, which is

therfore called the Eucharist,
because it is to be performed
as a thanksgiuing,
and praising of God.
            2. When daily we take
all occasions in priuate to
blesse God for his daily mercies:
but let these and such
like passe, as not proper to
this place. We must praise
him in our discourse to others:When we commend God, diuers things are to be obscued.
This is required of
vs in many Scriptures, Psa.
33. 1. Iob 36. 24. Psal. 96. 4.
But because this must not
bee done cursorily, diuers
rules are to bee obserued:
As,
            1. That we may praise
him effectually, wee must

               wisely consider of his workes,
and so of his nature to extract
from thence sound
arguments of praise, Psalm.
64. 9.
            2. We should do well
for this purpose to keep Records,
and Register vp the
speciall glorious workes of
God, Iob. 36. 24. & 37. 14.
Psalm. 78. 7.
            3. When we do praise
him, it must be done with
our whole heart, speaking of
his prayses with all possible
affection, and not as if we
spake of ordinary things,
Psalm. 9. 1.
            4. VVe must thus praise
him, not once, or for one

worke of his, but wee must
praise him for all his workes,
especially his wonderous
works, Psal. 9. 1. & 105. 1, 2.
& 106. 2.
            5. VVe must praise him
from day to day, and continue
to doe it, while wee
liue, Psal. 63. 4. & 96. 3.
            6. This is a duety, that
all the kindreds of the people
are bound to: All the people
must praise him, Psalm. 148.
12, 13. & 96. 6, 7, 8.
            Thus of the fift way of
shewing our loue to God,
and that is by honouring
him.
            The sixth way by which
wee must shew our loue to

God,6. By trusting in him. is, by trusting in him;
As men shew, whom they
loue most, by relying most
vpon them, and their fauour
and helpe; Now there
are diuers cases, in which
we must shew our trust in
God.
            1 By relying vpon his
mercy for our iustification
and saluation:
               How wee must shew it that we trust God. and in this
wee should most vse our
trust, as being in a businesse
that most highly concernes
vs, Esay 45. 24, 25.
            2 By committing all our
workes to him, for assistance
in them▪ or successe
of them: This is to commit
our way to God to be carefull

to seeke his assistance to
helpe vs, to doe our duty,
and then to leaue the successe
of all to his blessing,
Psal. 37. 3, 5. Prou. 16. 3.
            3 By beleeuing all that
hee saith is true, whether
hee promise, threaten, or
comfort by his Word, vpon
all occasions beleeuing
his Prophets, 2. Chro. 20. 20.
            4 By staying our hearts
vpon him in all our distresses:
               How wee may proue that wee trust God in distresse
Now in the time of
distresse we may proue, that
wee trust in God diuers
waies:—As
            1 By running to him,
and powring out our hearts
before him, making our

moane vnto him, Psa. 18. 2.
& 62. 10. Looke amongst
men, to whom we first run
to make our moane in our
distresse, and that person
is he whom we most loue,
and trust: so is it toward
God.
            2 By casting our cares and
burthens vpon him, Psal.
55. 22.
            3 By not respecting the
proud, and such as turne aside
to lies, Psal. 40. 4.
            4 By relying vpon his
help, Ioel 3. 16. Esay 50. 11.
but then we must obserue
how wee must relye vpon
Gods helpe: For there are
many things we must cast

out of our hearts in affliction:In relying vpon God in affliction, wee must auoid fiue things.
When wee haue
beene with the Lord and
committed our selues to
him, wee must relie vpon
him,
            1 Without leaning to our
owne vnder standing, or
wilfull inclination to follow
our owne courses,
and proiects, Prou. 3. 5.
            2 Without murmuring
or repining at our condition,
or vexing our
selues at the prouidence
of God toward vs, Psal.
37. 7.
            3 Without feare, that
is, without mistrustfull
feares, and seruile perturbations,

imagining
euils, which the Lord
hath not brought vpon
vs, Psal. 3. 6. & 27. 1.
            4 Without vsing ill
meanes to get out of distresse,
Amos 5. 4, 6.
            5 Yea, lastly, without
care, that is, without distrustfull
carking cares,
Phil. 4. 6.
            Thus of the sixth way of
shewing our loue to God,
and that is by trusting in
him.
            The seuenth & last way,7. By obeying him.
by which we must shew our
loue to God, is, To obey
him: For this is the loue of
God, that wee keepe his commandements:
               
Neither is
the signe in this, that wee
do what God requires for
the matter, but that his
cōmandements are not grieuous
vnto vs: Wee loue
God, if wee loue to doe
his worke, and if wee lift
vp our hearts in his waies,
setting vpon his work with
a speciall readinesse, and
strength of desire, and
more then ordinary care,
1. Ioh. 5. 2. 2. Chron. 17. 6. &
19. 2.
            Thus of the matter, that
is, the things by which we
must shew our loue to God;
The manner also is to bee
considered: For in all those

things which we would do
at any time to prooue our
loue to God, we must look
to the manner how wee do
them, as was a little touched
before:2. Things in the manner of shewing our loue to God. Now distinctly
wee must bring to
the declaration of our loue
to God, two things;

                  1 Feruencie.
                  2 Feare.
               
            
            For the first,1. Feruencie. wee must
loue God, and shew it in
all the fruits of our loue;
How? Euen with all our
hearts, and all our soules, and
all our might, and all our
vnderstanding. Our hearts
must bee more inflamed
then they are, in shewing

loue to wife, children,
friends, parents, &c. Wee
must loue God aboue all, Deut.
6. 3. & 30. 6.
            For the second,2. Feare. we must
loue God and shew it too,
but it must be with feare.
Howsoeuer with men true
loue casts our feare: yet
God being so infinite in
Glory and Maiestie, wee
must loue him, but yet
with feare. Now that this
may not be mistaken, I will
set downe the particulars
of this feare.
            Wee must shew our
feare:Eight wayes by which we shew our feare of God.
            
            1 By entertaining awful
thoughts of his dreadfull

Maiestie, casting out
all vile, meane, and vaine
thoughts of him, Dan.
6. 26.
            2 By departing from
euill, that might any way
displease him, being tender
in this point, not
daring to presume, or
plead impunity, or freedome
from danger, but
in all things desire to auoide
what might anger
him, Prou. 3. 7.
            3 By vsing all tearmes
of hearty abasement of
our selues, when wee
come before him: Thus
Abraham cals himselfe
dust and ashes; and thus

wee should humble our
selues vnder the mighty
hand of God, 1. Pet. 5. 9.
            4 By doing his will,
without fearing man, or
any other creature, Esay
8. 12, 13.
            5 By a daily and reuerent
remembrance of his
continuall holy presence.
            
            6 By trembling at his
iudgements, Psa. 4. 4. Hab.
2. vlt.
            
            7 By the humble vsing
of all the meanes
of communion with
God, vsing his Ordinances
with all conuenient
reuerence, attention,
and abasement of

our selues. Mal. 2. 5.
            8. Lastly, By the reuerend
vse of his very Titles,
fearing that great,
and fearefull Name of the
Lord our God, Deut. 28.
58.
         
         
            CHAP. VII.
            Rules, that concerne the preseruation
of our loue to
God.
            HItherto of the Rules
that concerne the
manifestation of our loue
to God: The rest of the
Rules serue to teach vs,
how to preserue in vs this

loue to God.
               What wee must do to preserue the loue of God in vs. Now that wee
may continue in our loue
to God, wee must obserue
these Rules.
            1 Wee must separate
our selues from all others to
be his, Leu. 20. 26. auoiding
fellowship with the seruants
of a strange God, that might
any way intice vs from the
loue of God; yea, wee
should so much alienate
our hearts from all Idols,
that we should not make
mention of their names, and
therefore daily confirme
our hearts in that purpose
to cleaue to God alone,
Leu. 20. 26. Mal. 2. 11. Exod.
34. 11. 14, 15. Exod. 23. 13.

Act. 11. 23. Iosh. 23. 8.
            2 Wee must beware,
that we forget not God, nor
go too long without effectual
remembrance of him.
They that can liue whole
daies and weekes without
any care to thinke of God,
may bee snre their hearts
are voide of the loue of
God: and as euer we would
continue to loue God, wee
must be carefull euery day
to remember him, and
thinke vpon him, Deut. 6.
12. & 32. 18.
            3 Wee must labour to
edify our selues in our most
holy faith; we must build vp
our hearts in the assurance

of that wonderfull loue
God hath shewed to vs:
and this will preserue and
keep vs in our loue to him
againe, Iude. 20.
            4. We must pray in the
holy Ghost, as is shewed in
the same place: prayer preserues
acquaintance with
God, and exceedingly quickens
the heart; and besides,
drawes from God
new pledges of his loue to
vs, which may serue to kindle
our affections toward
him.
            5. In the same place another
rule is imported;
and that is the daily expectation
of the Comming of

Christ: for the terrour of
that Day will mooue vs to
shew all possible loue to
God, and so will that singular
Glory wee are assured
to receiue in that Day.
            6. In the vse of all Gods
Ordinances, wee must bee
carefull to seeke out the face
of God, which is that speciall
presence of his grace.
For the loue of God will
decay in vs, if once wee
come to vse the meanes
onely for forme, and an
outward shew, Ps. 105. 4.
And if wee misse of God
in his Ordinances, we must
neuer be quiet, till we finde
him whom our soule loueth,

Cant. 3. 1. Psalm. 63. 1.
            7 VVee must preserue
the truth hee hath deliuered
to vs; yea, wee must
contend for it: for sound
doctrine laid vp in our
hearts, will preserue in vs
soundnesse of affection to
God, Iude 3.
            8. VVee must get Catalogues
of Gods praises in
particular, and fill our
hearts with the knowledge
& contemplation of them.
            9 If we would be preserued
in the loue of God,
wee must labour to attaine
to the ability to reioyce in
God, and delight our selues
in God. A wife that would

increase her loue to her
husband, must striue to solace
her selfe often with her
husband, and to forme in
her heart a speciall delight
in him: So must wee doe
to God. This is miserably
neglected, and yet exceeding
necessary: Nor is it
an ordinary ioy we should
take in God, but we should
ioy in him, first, with all our
hearts: 2. not for a time,
but alwaies, euery day; nor
with cōmon, but with exceeding
ioyes, Phi. 4. 4. Ps. 37. 4. &
68. 
                  •
               , 4. & 105. 3.About reioycing in God. Now that
this point may be the better
vnderstood, I will consider
of two things: first,

what it is to delight and

                  •
               oy in God: secondly, what
we should doe that might
delight, and take pleasure
in God.
            1. For the first,What it is to reioyce or delight our selues in God. this delight
in God hath in it foure
things distinctly.
            1 First, a spirituall satisfaction,
or contentment arising
from the assurance of
Gods loue to vs, as hauing
enough that he regards vs;
thus Dauid saith, his soule
was satisfied as with marrow,
Psal. 63. 5. & 149. 2.
            2. Secondly, a ioyfull
entertainement of all passages
of loue betweene God
and vs; especially in the

vse of his Ordinances.
            3. Thirdly, a delightfull
contemplation of God and
his mercies.
            4. Fourthly, a glorying in
God, and extolling of his
praises, as by discourse, so
by singing of Psalmes, 1. Cor.
1. 31. Psal. 33. 1. & 105. 3. &
68. 3, 4.
            Now for the attainement
of the ioying in God.
            1. VVee must mourne often
for our disabilities herein,What wee must doe that wee might bee able to ioy in God.
& pray to God to forme
this delight in vs.
            2. VVee must restraine
carnall ioyes, and cares: for
the excesse of both doth
exceedingly dull the heart,

and with-drawes it from
care of delight in God, Ioh.
2. 8. Phil. 4. 4, 5, 6.
            3. VVee must exercise
our selues with all the ioy
we can in the Word of God,
Psal. 119. 14, 16.
            4. VVee must take heed
of listning to Obiections
against the loue of God to
vs, whether they arise from
Sathan, or our owne flesh.
            5. VVe must often obserue
the miseries of the
wicked in comparison of
our happy estate in Christ,
Hab. 3. 17, 18.
            6 VVee must seek a delightfull
conuersation with
the godly.
            
               7 VVee must take heed
of domesticall euils, our
home sinnes, the corruptions
that would daily preuaile
in vs, Iob 22. 23, 26.
            8 VVee must restraine
our owne vnbeleefe about
the acceptation of the
good duties we performe,
and to this end wee must
take heed, that we be neither
iust ouermuch, by attributing
too much to our
selues: nor yet wicked ouermuch,
in condemning all we
do, as hatefull to God. For
this last doth maruellously
hinder vs from ioying in
God.
         
         
            
            CHAP. VIII.
            Containing generall rules about
Gods seruice.
            HItherto of the first
sort of Rules, that
concerne our carriage toward
God, namely, those
that concerne our loue to
God. Now the second
sort of Rules follow, and
that is,Rules about the s
                     •
                  ruice of God. those that concerne
the seruice of God, and
these may be cast into two
rankes: 1. for they either
concerne the parts of Gods
worship: 2. or the time of
Gods worship.
            The Rules that concerne

the parts of Gods worship,
1. are either generall, which
binde vs to the good behauiour
in all parts of Gods
worship: 2. or else certaine
specialties of Direction,
that concerne some part of
Gods worship onely.
            Now for the generall
rules, we should know and
remember, that there are
nine things to bee looked
to, and brought to the practice
of euery part of Gods
worship.Nine things to be remembred in euery part of Gods worship.
            
            1. The first is preparction;
wee must in some sort
conferre with our owne
hearts, and prepare them,
before wee go before God

to doe any seruice, Iob 11.
13. Psal. 4. 4. Ezech. 7. 10.
            2. Secondly, wee must
come with all reuerence &
godly feare, Hebr. 12. 28.
Psal. 2. 11.
            3. Thirdly, we must performe
the seruice in repentance
for our sinnes: wee
must not come before
God in the loue of any sin:
if wee doe, we lose our labour,
and God will loath
our workes, Isai. 1. Iob. 11.
14. VVee must haue cleane
hands, and a pure heart, or
else no seruice of God will
be accepted, Psalm. 119. 11.
& 24. 4.
            4. Fourthly, it must

grieue vs, that others will
not serue God, Psalm. 119.
139.
            5. Fifthly, we must performe
euery seruice in the
name of Christ, or else it
cannot bee accepted, by
reason of that euill that
cleaues to our best workes,
whether wee pray or giue
thankes, or Whatsoeuer we
doe, wee must doe it in the
name of Christ, Col. 3. 17.
            6. Sixtly, in euery seruice
of God wee must so
neer as it may be, giue God
the first place, preferring the
respects of God and his
worship, before our selues,
or the regard of others: we

must serue him betimes, seeking
God in the first place,
Iob 8. 5. Math. 6. 34. Psalm.
5. 3.
            7. Seuenthly, when we
doe any seruice to God, we
must do it with all our harts,
with as much willingnesse
as may be, so as it may appeare,
that we loue to be his
seruants,
as the Prophets
phrase is, 1. Sam. 12. 10. 1.
Chron. 28. 9. Esay 56. 6.
            8. Eightly, in all seruice
wee must striue so to
serue God, that wee may
please him, not onely carefull
to doe the duety, but
carefull of Gods acceptation.
In good duties being

cheefely carefull to see
Gods approbation, not
caring so much for the
praise of men, as the praise of
God. In euery part of Gods
worship, our praise must
be of God, and not of men,
Heb. 12. 28. Rom. 2. 26.
            9. Ninthly, wee must
cleaue to God with detestation
of all things, or persons,
that might any way
draw vs away from his seruice,
Deut. 13. 4, 5.
         
         
            
            CHAP. IX.
            Shewing how we should carry
our selues in Gods House.
            HItherto of the rules to
bee obserued in all
parts of Gods worship generally.
            The speciall rules concerne
1. eyther,Rules about the publike worship of God. Gods publike
worship in his House:
2. or else the particular
parts of Gods worship
each by themselues.
            The godly Christian
ought with all care to lay
before him the rules that
binde him to the good behauiour

in Gods House, &
to striue to fashion his nature
and practice, as may
become the glory of Gods
publike seruice and presence,
and so there bee diuers
things which in a speciall
manner he must looke
to in performing Gods
publike seruice.
            For concerning these
publike duties, these rules
must be obserued.
            First,1. All must come. that all sorts & degrees
of men must appeare
before God publikely to
doe him homage and seruice.
None must bee spared
or freed, men, women,
and children must all take

notice of it, that they are
bound hereunto, Deut. 31.
11, 12.
            Secondly,2. With all possible reuerence we must come
our selues with all possible
reuerence, and looke to our
feete when we enter into the
house of God, and striue to
shew before all men our
most carefull respect of
God and his holy ordinances:
For God will be sanctified
in them that come nigh
him, and he lookes for it at
our hands by our reuerend
behauiour, to bee glorified
before all the people, Leuit.
10. 3. Eccl. 5. 4. Wee should
then shew a most holy
feare of Gods name, and presence,

               Psalm. 5. 7.
            Thirdly,3. And zeale. in publike duties,
that of the Prophet
Dauid should be true of vs:
The zeale of Gods house
should eate vs vp,And this zeale wee should shew six waies. Psal. 69. 9.
and this speciall zeale wee
should shew:
            1. By louing Gods house
aboue all the places in the
world, our hearts should be
fired in vs in that wee respect,
that wee may truely
say with Dauid, O how I loue
thy house! Psalm. 26. 8.
            2. By confirming our
own hearts in a resolution
to resort to Gods house
with all ioy and gladnesse,
notwithstāding the scornes

and oppositions of worldly
men and persons.
            3. By stirring vp others
with all importunity to go
vp with them to worship
God in Sion, Esay 2. 2.
            4. By making haste to
Gods worship, going to
the house of God with the
first, & with willing hearts,
with a holy thirst after the
meanes, flocking and flying
thither as the clouds, or
as so many doues to their
windowes, Zach. 8. 21. Psal.
110. 3. Esay 35. 1. & 60. 8.
            5. By forwardnes and
cheerefulnesse in contributing
towards the maintenance
of Gods House, and

seruice in the means thereof,
Isaiah 60. 8, 9.
            6. By grieuing heartily,
because other men neglect
or contemn the House of
God, and haue no more
mind to keepe Gods Law,
Psalm. 119. 136.
            Thus of that speciall
zeale wee should shew about
Gods publike worship.
            4. Fourthly,4. With one consent. we should
in all publike dueties serue
God with one consent and
one heart. There should appeare
in Gods seruants a
wonderful desire of Vnanimity
and concord. They
should serue the Lord vvith

one shoulder, that when they
speake to God, it may be as
the voyce of one man,
when the Lord speakes to
them, they should heare
with one heart. It is a maruellous
glory in Religion,
when people can come
once to this, to serue the
Lord with one shoulder, Zephan.
3. 9.
            Lastly, in the 52. Psalm.
v. 8, 9.Three other rules gathered out of Psal. 52. 8, 9. we may gather three
other rules, which in a speciall
manner fitte vs for a
right behauiour in Gods
house.
            1. First, wee should alwaies
be as green Oliue trees
in the house of the Lord.
               
Howsoeuer it go with men
in the world, yet when wee
come before the Lord, our
hearts should reioyce and
reuiue, and our spirits bee
fresh and cheerefull, and
our affections should bee
healed of all the cares or
distempers were before in
them. Gods ordinances
should haue such a power
ouer vs, as to make a sudden
fresh spring of desires,
and holy thoughts in vs.
There is this power in the
ordinances of God to effect
this, if the fault be not
in vs, I meane, when these
ordinances are exercised
in the power & life of thē.
            
               2. Secondly, wee must
trust on the mercy of GOD,
bringing a heart ready to
beleeue euery good word
of God, resoluing, that if
the Lord will speake comfortably
to his seruants, we
will not dishonor his cōsolations
through carelesnes,
or vnbeleefe: but receiue
them with all our hearts,
and establish our selues in
the safe keeping of his
good word.
            3. Thirdly, we must resolue
to be thankefull, with
all tendernesse for all experiences
of Gods presence
and goodnesse towards vs
in the means, vowing with

               Dauid, to praise him for euer
for them. And if the
Lord doe with-hold his
power and presence for a
time, so as we feele not the
effectualnesse of his ordinances:
yet we should resolue
without distemper, to
wait vpon the Lord, and obserue
him according to the
seasons of his grace.
         
         
            CHAP. X.
            Rules that order vs about
hearing of the Word.
            THus of the rules that
we must obserue in all
publike seruice of God.

Now there be certain speciall
rules which must bee
particularly headed in
each part of Gods worship
by it selfe.Rules that order vs in hearing the word of God. And first I will
beginne with those rules,
which wee must more specially
obserue in hearing
the Word of God, and
these are of three sorts.
            1. Some bind vs to the
good behauior, before we
come to heare.
            2. Some at the time of
hearing.
            3. Some after we haue
heard.
            1. Before wee come to
heare, we must bring with
vs two things.
            
               1.1. Before we come. A resolution to deny
our own wits, reasons, opinions,
and conceits, and
empty our heads of al perswasion
of our owne skill,
to iudge in the things of
the kingdome of God, being
ready to beleeue and
thinke in all things, as God
shall teach vs out of his
Word. We must be fooles,
that we may be wise, 1. Cor.
3. 18. humbling our selues at
his very feete to receiue his
Law, Deut. 33. 3.
            2. VVe must bring with
vs a meeke and quiet spirit, a
minde quieted from passions,
lusts, and perturbations,
and at rest from the

turmoyling cares of this
world. The world is able
to doe great things in our
hearts, if wee receiue it with
meekenesse, Iam. 1. 19.
            Secondly,2. In the time of hearing. at the time of
hearing, we must looke to
two rules.
            First, wee must hearken
without distraction: wee
must heare, as it were for
our liues, wee must incline
our eares, and shake off all
impediments arising from
our owne drowsinesse, preiudice,
or vaine thoughts,
or distracting obiects, Esay
55. 3. Psal. 119. 113.
            Secondly, we must proue
all things, and keepe that

which is good. Wee must
heare with iudgement, and
hearken for our selues, hauing
speciall care to looke
to that doctrine which in
particular concernes vs to
lay it vp in our hearts, and
apply it effectually. This
is a rule of singular thrift
in godlinesse. If wee did
marke what sinne in vs the
Lord reprooues, or what
comfort is specially fitted
to our hearts: or what direction
doeth specially
concerne vs: He hath an
honest memory that will
bee sure to keepe these
things,Note. though hee forget
all the rest, and hee hath a

wretched memory, and
hart too, that forgets these
things, though hee could
r
                  •
               peat all the Sermon verbatim.
            
            Thirdly,3. After we haue heard. after wee haue
heard, two things also must
be further done.
            First, wee must by meditation
labor to make those
things wee haue heard,
which concerne vs, fast,
that they runne not out of
our mindes, and wee must
take heed that neyther the
Diuell steale away the
good seed, nor our owne
heart through negligence
forget it. Neyther is this a
worke for an houre after,

to keepe these things till
we may repeate them to others,
but ought to be our
daily worke, especially the
weeke after to thinke so often
of them, till there be a
sure impression of the
VVord in our hearts, Hebr.
2. 1, 2.
            Secondly, wee must yet
further see to it, that we be
doers of the Word, yea wee
must obserue to doe: as the
phrase of the holy Ghost
is. It is the wisedome of
God so to dispose of his ordinances,
that wee receiue
our directions by parcels,
and there is a time of interim
between Sabbath and

Sabbath, Sermon and Sermon,
that we might in that
space learne to frame our
selues to the obedience of
the truths receiued, that so
we might bee ready to receiue
new lessons from the
Lord. The surest way for
the husbandman to keepe
his seed, is not to lay it vp
in his barne, but to cast it
into the ground. For what
is sowed, he may receiue againe
with aduantage; or
if hee might faile of a haruest
from his seede in nature,
yet godly men shall
neuer faile to receiue what
they sowe by practice, with
increase. So much of the

Truth, as is put into practice,
is sure for euer: The
rest may be lost: and it is a
singular helpe to a Christian,
if he set vpon his obedience,
while the doctrine
is yet fresh in his minde;
for delay will compasse
him about with many difficulties,
and hee will want
those inward incitations,
that might stirre vp his
heart with power and
strength to obey.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XI.
            Rules about the Sacrament
of Baptisme.
            THus of the rules of
our carriage about
hearing: Next wee are to
consider, how we are to order
our selues in respect of
the Sacraments: The Sacraments
are two: Baptisme,Rules about Baptisme.
and the Lords Supper.
            The duties we are bound
to in respect of Baptisme,
concerne either

                  1. Our children.
                  2. Our selues.
                  
                     3. Others.
               
            
            For our children,1. About our children. it is
our duty to present them
vnto Baptisme, but withall
we must looke to it, that
it be done in due time, and
with faith and thankefulnesse
to God: In due time,
so as thereby wee signifie
our great estimation of
Gods mercy to our seed,
and our great desire to
haue the Couenant sealed,
euen vnto them. We must
also bring them to Baptisme
with faith in Gods
Couenant. The Lord
hath bound himselfe to bee
our God, and the God of our
seed: Now it is our parts to

giue glory to God, and to
declare before the Lord
our perswasion of his
goodnesse and claime to
that part of his Couenant.
By faith wee plead our
right, wheras by vnbeleefe
wee giue God occasion to
neglect our seed. I adde
also with thankfulnesse, because
we ought with great
ioy and acknowledgement
of the free grace of God,
to behold our seed admitted
in the sure couenant of
mercy and saluation with
our selues, and ought to
thinke that God hath done
more for our children, to
admit them into Couenant

by Baptisme, then if
the greatest person on
earth had made vpon them
the assurance of some great
estate of maintenance or
preferment.
            Secondly,2. About our selues. for our selues,
we must make conscience
of it, to make vse of our
owne Baptisme, and that
throughout the whole
course of our life: It is giuen
vs as a seale of Gods
promises, and as a vow of
our obedience, and so we
must make vse of it all the
daies of our life, especially
in three cases:In three cases.
            
            First, in the case of
doubting and feare of the

forgiuenesse of our sinnes,
or of the saluation of our
soules: for Baptisme saueth
vs, that is, effectually assures
vs of our saluation;
and wee doe not offend in
trusting Gods promise
made in his Word, and
signed and sealed in Baptisme.
As certainely doth
it saue our soules, as the
Arke saued the bodies of
Noah and his houshold; so
as wee cannot miscarry, if
wee leape not out of the
Arke into the Seas of waters.
Let vs stick to our
Baptisme, and then we are
safe: The washing in Baptisme
did assure the washing

of our soules by the
Bloud of Christ for our
sinnes. If I be tempted to
doubt of my saluation, I
must say to my own soule,
Hath not the Lord prouided
me the Arke of Baptisme
to preserue me from
the seas of his wrath? And
if I doubt the forgiuenesse
of sinnes, I must say, Hath
not the Lord washed mee
from my sins by the bloud
of his Sonne? Did hee
not shew mee so much in
Baptisme? VVee sinne
shamefully, in that wee doe
not make this vse, but neglect
the confidence Baptisme
should worke in vs,

as if the Lord had but dallied
with vs, or that Baptisme
were but some idle
Ceremony, 1. Pet. 3. 21. 1.
Cor. 15. 29. Act. 22. 16.
            2. Secondly,How Baptisme may helpe vs against sinne. in the case
of temptation to commit
sinne: we ought to fight against
sinne by his mighty
weapon of our Baptisme,
and so wee may doe by diuers
arguments: As
            First, in my Baptisme I
haue made a vow to God,
that I would cleaue to him
in Iesus Christ, and renounce
the world, the deuill
and sinne: and shall I
break my vow to God, that
would bee ashamed to

break my promise to men?
            Secondly, my Baptisme
was the Baptisme of repentance:
and shall I yet liue in
sinne? My body was washed:
and shall my soule bee
still impure? Math. 3. 11.
Mark. 1. 4. Acts 13. 24.
            Thirdly, by Baptisme I
was assured of the vertue
of the death of Christ to kill
sinne in me: And shall I
not beleeue the operation
of God, that hee can deliuer
me from the power, or
powerfull temptations, or
inclinations to any sinne?
Shall I not seek strength of
Christ? or shall I betray
my selfe to the deuill and

the flesh? In Christ I am
dead to sinne, and shall I
yet liue therein? Rom. 6. 1, 3.
Col. 2. 12.
            Thirdly, our Baptisme
must bee vsed against the
doubts of perseuering, or
whether we shall bee kept
vnto saluation, and whether
our bodies shall bee raised
againe at the last Day: for
God hath assured all this
vnto vs in our Baptism, that
we haue our part not onely
in the death of Christ, but
also in the resurrection of
Christ: and if Christ bee
raised in vs, Christ can die
no more, either in himselfe,
or in our hearts,

and the same power, that
raised him out of the graue,
will also raise vp our bodies
at the last Day, as is pleaded,
Romanes 6. 10, &c.
Galath. 3. 27, 28. 1. Cor. 15.
29. 1. Pet. 3. 21. If wee be
baptized, and beleeue, wee
shall certainely bee saued,
Mark. 16. 16.
            Thus as it concernes
our selues.
            3. In respect of others,3. In respect of others.
we are bound to the good
behauiour in Baptisme, as
to acknowledge the communion
of Saints: so are we
tied to preserue our selues
in all brotherly loue with
the godly, who weare the

same Liuery with vs, and
are Souldiers prest to
the same warre, and haue
taken vpon them the same
holy Vow with vs: we are
bound in Baptisme to loue
them, to stand for them aboue
all other people, and
to liue with them in all holy
loue, to our liues end,
Ephes. 4. 3, 4, 5. 1. Cor. 12. 13.
& 1. 13. Gal. 3. 27, 28.
         
         
            CHAP. XII.
            Rules about the Lords Supper.
            HItherto concerning
Baptisme: The Rules

that concerne the Lords
Supper, follow.
            Now concerning this
Sacrament,Rules about the Lords Supper. we are charged
with these things:
            1. First,1. Wee must examine our selues. 
               Examination,
1. Cor. 11. we must examine
our selues, and so eate and
drinke: Examine our selues,
so as wee be sure there bee
no sinne in our hearts and
liues, which we haue committed,
but wee are desirous
to forsake, and do vnfaignedly
iudge our selues
for it, being as desirous to
forsake it, as we desire God
should in the Sacrament
forgiue it.
            2. Secondly, The discerning

of the Lords Bodie
and Bloud:
               2. We must discerne the Lords Body. so comming to
partake of these outward
signes of Bread & Wine,
as we withall know and beleeue
the presence of
Christ; and that God doth
as effectually giue Christ to
the soule of the beleeuer,
as hee giues Bread and
Wine to his body: yea,
we must thus discerne and
beleeue, that hee is there
offered and giuen vnto vs
also, and that God doth
not delude vs, but as truely
giues vs the Bodie and
bloud of Christ, as he doth
by the Minister giue vs the
bread and wine, 1. Cor. 11.
            
               Thirdly,3. We must shew forth Christs death. 
               The shewing
forth of the death of Christ:
This is a solemnity, where
wee must intend to make a
solemne remembrance of
the Passion and Death of
our Sauiour, not onely in
being present at the breaking
of the Bread, and
powring out of the Wine,
but in raising vp in our
hearts a thankefull remembrance
of his grieuous sufferings
and death for our
sinnes, Math. 26. 1. Cor. 11.
            Fourthly,4. We vow to cleaue to the godly. 
               Fellowship and
louing communion with the
godly, which wee both signifie,
and vow in the Sacraments,
and testifie before

God and men, that
wee will cleaue vnto them
aboue all the people in the
world, as being the same
bread with vs, euen members
of the same Mysticall
Bodie of Christ, 1. Cor. 10.
            Fifthly,5. We must be reconciled. speciall reconciliation
with such as we haue
offended, bearing malice
to no man, and desiring
and seeking peace with all
sorts of men, Math. 5. Rom.
12.
            Sixtly,6. We vow a holy life. and lastly, The
vowes of sinceritie, resoluing
to keepe this feast all
our life in the vnleauened
bread of sincerity and truth,
euen to spend. our daies in

all vprightnesse of heart,
and vnfaigned hatred of
all sinne and hypocrisie, 1.
Cor. 5. 8.
         
         
            CHAP. XIII.
            Rules about prayer.
            THVS of the Sacraments.
            The Rules concerning
prayer follow;Rules about prayer. where besides
the generall Rules,
that belong to all worship,
these things in speciall must
bee heeded concerning
prayer.
            1. Thy words must bee
few,
               Thy words must bee few. 
               Eccles. 5. 1, 2. and the

reason is, because God is in
heauen, and thou art in earth:
Hee is full of Maiestie and
Wisedome, and thou art
an infirme and sinfull creature:
Length of it selfe
doth not commend prayer;
we must speake as becomes
the Maiestie of
God, without vaine repetitions
and babblings, pattering
ouer of the same
things is not pleasing to
God: As affectation is ill
in any thing, so much more
ill in prayer. This Rule
may bee vnsauory in the
taste of some that are transported
with rash zeale:
But let them take heed of

               will-worship: the words are
so plaine in the Text, as
they must informe themselues
about them: The
Lord knew what was fittest
for vs, when hee gaue vs
this charge.
            2. Thy heart must be lifted vp
in the performance
of this duty;2. The heart must bee lifted vp. This is often
imported in diuers Scriptures,
and this lifting vp of
the hart hath diuers things
in it.
            1. Vnderstanding: thou
must be aduised what thou
prayest for, and know thy
warrant, that what thou askest
is according to Gods
will. 1. Cor. 14. 15. 1. Ioh. 5. 14
            
               2. Freedome from distractions:
Thy heart must be cleansed from passions
and lusts: Thy prayer must
be without wrath, 1. Tim.
3. 8. And as the distractions
arising from passion must
bee auoided, so must a
                  •
               l other
distractions.
            3. Feruency, or the stretching
out of the affections
according to the matter of
prayer; thou must expresse
the affections of prayer:
for God looks at the prayer
of thy heart, not at the prayer
of thy lippes onely.
            3. Thou must pray with
all manner of prayer,
               3. Vse all manner of prayer. according
to the occasions of

prayer: Thou must pray at
thy set times daily, and
thou must pray also with
eiaculations (as Diuines call
them) that is, those suddain
and short speeches to God,
when thy heart is moued
vpon speciall occasion:
Thou must vse Supplications,
Deprecations, Intercessions,
Confessions, giuing of
Thankes, or the like, according
to thy necessities, or
the other occasions of thy
life: Thou must striue to
get a fitnesse and language
to speake vnto God for thy
selfe in thine own words, as
may best expresse the desires
of thine hart, Eph. 6. 18
            
               4. Thou must continue
and perseuer in prayer without
ceasing:
               4. Thou must perseuer in prayer. prayer must bee
the worke of thy whole
life, not an exercise for a
fit, for a day or two, or
a week or two, or a month
or two: thou must make
conscience of prayer alwaies,
Ephes. 6. 18. 1. Thess. 3.
17.
            5. When thy prayer is
grounded vpon Gods will,5. Thou must bee instant, without fainting or discouragement.
thou must be instant, and
not faint, or be discouraged:
Thou must pray without
doubting and wauering,
as resolued neuer to cease
praying, till God heare and
shew mercy. 'Tis basenesse

of minde, not humility, to
be quickly discouraged: if
God entertaine vs not according
to our expectation,
or liking, we must not
bee weary of seeking to
God, but set vpon prayer,
with a resolution to take no
nay, Luk. 18. 1. Iam. 1. 6.
            6. Thou must remember
supplication for all
Saints,
               6. With supplication for all Saints. especially to pray
heartily for Magistrates &
Ministers; especially those
vnder whose charge thou
art, Ephes. 6. 18, 19. 1. Tim.
2. 1.
            7. Thou must looke to
it,7. In all things giue thankes. that in all things thou giue
thankes: Let the Lord see

the truth of thy heart herein,
that what thou obtainest
from God, especially by
prayer, thou wilt with all
gladnesse remember and
acknowledge: This Rule
must by no meanes be forgotten,
1. Thess. 5. 18. Colos.
4. 2.
         
         
            CHAP. XIIII.
            Rules about reading the
Scriptures.
            THus of the Rules that
concerne praier: There
remaines the reading of
Scripture, and singing of
Psalmes, as the other parts

of the ordinary worship of
God.
            Concerning the reading
of the Scriptures,Rules about reading the Scripture. I
will instance in one place
of Scripture onely, which
containes the charge giuen
to Ioshua, chap. 1. 8, 9.
which comprehends the
substance of the necessary
directions about priuate
reading. I say necessary; for
godly men may, and haue
aduised diuers courses for
reading of Scripture,
which are not absolutely
necessary, but arbitrary, as
may stand with the leasure
and capacity of the person
that will reade: such are

those directions, that
shew how many chapters
may bee read in a day, and
what things may be obserued
in reading, &c. which,
as they may bee profitable
to many Christians, & expedient
too, yet they must
not bee vnderstood so, as
that those persons sinne,
which reade not so often,
or so many chapters, or the
like. The things therefore
that must necessarily be obserued
by such as can reade
the Bible, I take to be these:
            First,1. R
                     •
                  ade daily. they must exercise
themselues therin daily, they
must constantly be imployed
therin, & if their occasions

interrupt thē at some
time, they must redeeme it
at other times: This is the
praise of the blessed man,
That he exerciseth himselfe
in Gods Law day and night;
that is, constantly, Psal. 1. 2.
            Secondly,2. Meditate of what thou readest. in reading they
must meditate therein, that
is, they must obserue profitable
things, as they reade,
attending to reading, & marking
what the Lord saith vnto
them by that part of the
Word which they reade:
This is that meditation,
which is chiefly required of
a Christiā, to get into their
harts good thoughts frō the
matter they reade of, so as

they may the better bee inabled
to imploy their
thoughts all the day after.
            Thirdly,3. Confer vpon it. The Word of
God must not depart out of
their mouth; they must
make the best vse of it they
can, in conference to speak
of it to others, for the edification
of themselues and
others.
            Fourthly,4. Resolue to obey. They must obserue
in their reading, what
the Lord saith vnto them,
that concernes their practice:
They must obserue to
do according to those holy
directions they reade of:
They must bring a minde
desirous, and resolued to

let the Word of God both
informe them, & reforme
them, making conscience
of it, to let God direct
them by his holy Word
read, and not onely by
the Word preached to
them: Their liues must be
bettered by their reading,
and to that end they must
obserue the chiefest things
they can, out of their reading,
to remember them in
their practice.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XV.
            Rules about singing of
Psalmes.
            THe rules,Rules about singing of Psalmes. that concern
the singing of Psalms,
are summarily comprehended
in that place, Col.
3. 16. and they are these:
            1. First, they must teach
one another by their Psalms,
and Hymnes, and spirituall
songs. They must learne to
profit, and make good vse
of the holy matter contained
in the Psalmes they
sing.
            2. Secondly, they must
sing with their hearts, they

must attend to the matter
they sing of, & lift vp their
hearts, as well as their
voices.
            3. Thirdly, they must sing
with grace in their hearts,
they must imploy the graces
of the holy Spirit, or
Gods Spirit in singing of
Psalmes, as wel as in prayer,
or any other ordinance of
God.
            4. Fourthly, they must
make melody to the Lord:
They must direct their
songs to God, and to his
glory, and not vse them as
meere ciuill imploiments,
but as parts of Gods seruice.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XVI.
            Rules about Vowing and
Swearing.
            HItherto of the Rules,
that concerne the
most vsuall parts of Gods
seruice: There are other
parts of Gods seruice,
which are to be vsed, but at
certaine times, and vpon
speciall occasions, & these
are Vowes, and Oathes, and
Fasting.
            
            The rules about Vowing
are briefely comprehended
in that place,The Rules about vowing. 
               Eccl
                     •
                  s. 5.
3, 4. and they are chiefly
two.
            
               1. First, Before thou vowest,
consider: consider, I say,
thine owne strength, whether
thou be able to do it:
and consider also the end,
that it bee to Gods glory;
and consider the matter,
that thou vow not things
vnlawfull: and consider
what may be the euents of
thy Vow, for all Vowes being
made before the Angell,
that takes notice of all
Couenants, it will bee in
vaine afterwards to plead,
it was an errour, thou wast
mistaken: God may bee angry
at thy voice, and destroy
the worke of thy hands: Be
not rash therefore, to cause

thy flesh to sinne therein.
            2. Secondly, when thou
hast vowed thy vow to
God, deferre not to pay it,
be sure thou performe it:
it is a grieuous offence to
breake a lawfull vow: Better
it is thou shouldst not
vow, then that thou shouldst
vow, and not pay.
            
            Thus of Vowing.
            Concerning the Oath,Rules about Swearing.
when thou art called to
sweare, thou must obserue
these Rules:
            First, that thou sweare
not by any thing which is not
God, Ier. 5. 7.
            Secondly, that thou
sweare in truth, that is, that

thy conscience know, what
thou swearest is true.
            Thirdly, that thou
sweare in iudgement, that is,
with due consideration of
the nature of God, and
with sound deliberation,
not rashly, and diligently
weighing of all things, that
belong to the matter thou
swearest about.
            Fourthly, that thou sweare
in righteousnesse, that is about
lawfull things, & iust
matters: Thou must not
sweare to do vniust things,
as Dauid sware to kil Nabal:
nor must thou swear about
impossible things, or about
things that are doubtfull

and vncertaine: Nor in
the forme of thy oath must
thou vse such words, as be
contumelious to God, or
expresse not sufficient reuerence
to the Diuine Maiestie,
as they that wickedly
sweare by any part of
Christ, or such like.
         
         
            CHAP. XVII.
            Rules about Fasting.
            THus of Vowes and
Swearing; Fasting followes:
Now if we would
keep a religious Fast vnto
God, wee must obserue
these two Rules.
            
               First,The Rules about a religious Fast. wee must looke to
the strictnesse of the abstinence
in the day of our Fast;
for we must abstaine from
all sorts of meate as well as
one, and from all labour
also, and from our costliest
apparell, and from recreations
and vsuall delights:
Wee must keepe the day,
as wee keepe the Sabbath, in
forbearing our own works,
Ion. 3. 6, 7. 1. Cor. 7. 5. Ioel 1.
& 2. Leuit. 16.
            Secondly, the time must
bee spent in religious duties,
as a Sabbath, especially
in the exercises that
concerne the humiliation of
the soule, in renewing of

our repentance, for the obtaining
of pardon of sin,
or some speciall blessing
of God, or the preuenting,
or remouing of some great
iudgement of God.
            The former rule concernes
onely the ceremonie,
or outward exercise of
the bodie: but this rule
containes the substance of
the dutie, without which a
religious fast is not kept
vnto God, who regardeth
not the hanging down of the
head like a bull-rush, if the
soule bee not humbled before
God for sinne: Leu. 16. 29.
Ioel 1. 14. & 2. 16, 17.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XVIII.
            Rules about the Sabbath.
            HItherto of the Rules,
that concerne the
parts of Gods worship: The
rules, that concerne the
time of Gods worship, follow,
and this time especially is
the Sabbath day.
            Now the rules,Rules about the Sabbath. that bind
vs to the good behauiour
concerning the Sabbath,
cōcern either the preparation
to the Sabbath, or the
maner of performing holy
duties on the Sabbath.
            The preparation to the
Sabbath,1. The preparation to it. containes in it

these things.
            First, the ending of all our
workes on the sixe daies, as
God did his: Gen. 2. 2.
            This example of God is
set downe, not onely to
shew what hee did, but to
prescribe vnto vs, what we
should doe, as is manifest
by vrging this example in
the reason of the commandement:
We must then
take order to finish the
workes of the weeke daies
with such discretion, that
neither our heads be troubled
with the cares of
them, nor our hands tempted
to worke about them
on the Sabbath day.
            
               Secondly, the preuenting
of domesticall grieuances,
and perturbations,
Leuit. 19. 3. Yee shall feare
euery man his mother and
his father, and keep my Sabbath.
Discords and contentions,
and heart-burnings
in the members of
the family, extend their infection,
and hurt, euen to
the prophaning of Gods
Sabbath. The Lord looks
not to bee serued aright in
his House, if people liue
not quietly, and louingly,
and dutifully in their own
houses.
            Thirdly, we must cleanse
our selues, that we may keep

the Sabbath, Nehem. 13.
22. Which place, though
it speake of Legall cleansing,
yet it shadowes out
that Moral and perpetuall
care of cleansing our
selues, that ought euen to
be found in vs. And thus
we doe cleanse our selues,
when we humble our selues,
that we may walk with God,
confessing our sinnes, euen
the sinnes of the weeke
past, & making our peace
with God, through the
name of Iesus Christ.
            Thus of the duties of
preparation:2. Of the celebration of the Sabbath. Now for the
manner of keeping the
Sabbath, the rules prescribe

vnto vs these things:
            1. Rest from all our works,
whether they be workes of
labour, or workes of pleasure.
Workes of labour
the Scripture instanceth in
such, as are selling of victuals:
Nehem. 13. 15. Carrying
of burthens: Ierem. 17.
Iournying from our places,
Exod. 16. 29. The businesse
of our callings done
by our selues, our children,
seruants, or cattell,
which the words of the
Commandement forbid.
And as workes of labour,
so also workes of pleasure are
forbidden, Esay 58. 13.
            2. Readinesse and delight.
               
We should loue to be Gods
seruants on this day, Esay
56. and consecrate it with
ioy, as a glorious priuiledge
to vs, Esay 58. 13. abhorring
wearinesse, or a desire
to haue the Sabbath gone,
and ended, Amos 8.
            3. Care and Watchfulnesse.
We must obserue to
keepe it: Exod. 31. 16. we
must take heede to our selues,
that no duty bee omitted,
and that wee no way prophane
it, tending our
hearts, and our words, Ier.
17. 21.
            4. Sinceritie, and this
sinceritie we should shew
diuers waies.
            
               First, by doing Gods
worke with as much care,
as we would doe our own,
or rather shewing more
care for the seruice of
GOD. They had their
double sacrifices on the
Sabbath, in the time of
the Law, and wee should
studie, how wee might
please GOD in especiall
manner on that day, choosing
out the things that
might delight him: God
hath taken but one day of
seuen for his worke; and
shall wee not doe it willingly?
Further, if wee
respect our selues, shall we
not bee as carefull to prouide

for our soules on the
Sabbath, as for our bodies
on the weeke daies?
            2. By obseruing the whole
day, as well as a part, and
keeping the Sabbath in
our dwellings, as well as in
Gods house: God requires
the whole day, and not a
part. As wee would not
be contented our seruants
should worke for vs onely
an houre, or two in the
six daies: so neither should
wee yeeld lesse vnto God,
then wee require for our
selues. Nor will it suffice
to serue God by publike
duties in his House, vnlesse
wee serue him also by

priuate duties in our own
dwellings, Commandement
4. Leuit. 23. 3.
            3. By auoiding the lesser
violations of the Sabbath,
as well as the greater, especially
not transgressing of
contempt, or wilfulnesse
in the least things we know
to bee forbidden. The
Prophet instanceth: Isaiah
58. 13. Wee must not speake
our owne words. Thus of
sinceritie.
            5. The fift thing required
of vs, is Faith: we must
glorifie GOD by beleeuing,
that hee will make
it a day of blessing vnto
vs, and performe that blessing

hee hath promised,
accepting our desire to
walke before him in the
vprightnesse of our hearts,
and passing by our infirmities,
and fraileties. We
many times disturbe the
rest and Sabbath of our
soules by vnbeliefe, Commandement
4. Genes. 2. 2.
Exod. 31. 13. Ezech. 20. 20.
& 46. 2, 5.
            6. The last thing is Deprecation:
wee must beseech
God, when we haue
done our best, to shew vs
mercie, and spare vs for
our defects and weakenesses.
Thus wee must
end the day, and reconcile

our selues to GOD,
that the Rest of Iesus
Christ may be established
in our hearts, Nehem. 13.
22. And thus of the rules,
that binde vs to the good
behauiour, in respect of
the time of Gods worship.
         
         
            CHAP. XIX.
            Rules that shew vs how to
carry our selues, when wee
come into company, in respect
of Religion.
            HItherto of the rules,
that concerne our
carriage toward God?Rules that direct our carriage towards men.
            
            Now it followes, that I
breake open those directions,

that should bring our
liues into order in respect
of men: And these rules
are of two sorts, for either
they are such, as binde
vs to the good behauiour
towards all men,
               1. Towards all men. or such, as
order our conuersation toward
some men onely, as
they are considered to bee
either wicked or godly.
            
            The rules that concerne
all men, may bee cast into
two heads, as they belong
either to righteousnesse, or to
mercy.
            
            The rules that belong
to righteousnesse,And so 1. in cōpany. order vs
either in company, or out of
company.
            
            
               The rules which we are
to obserue in company, concerne
either,

                  1. Religion, or
                  
                  2. The sinnes, and faults
of others: or
                  3. Our owne inoffensiue
behauiour towards all men.
               
            
            1. For the first,With due respect of Religion. when
we come in company, wee
must be carefull to be that
which may become the
glory of Gods truth, and
the Religion we professe,
that wee take not vp the
name of God in vaine: And
thus we shall rightly order
our selues, if wee obserue
these Rules:
            First, to be soundly aduised,

before wee fall into
discourse of Religion, not
doing it, till God may bee
glorified by it; A wise man
concealeth knowledge, but
the heart of fooles will publish
foolishnesse: It is as
great a discretion to know
how to conceale knowledge,
as it is to know how
to vse knowledge.
            Secondly, auoide vaine
ianglings,Auoiding vaine ianglings in 3. things. and contradiction
of words, such as are
            1. Doubtfull disputations
about Ceremonies, and
things indifferent, which
may entangle the weake, and
keep them from more necessarie
cares and knowledge,

               Rom. 14. 1.
            2. Curious Questions, about
things that are not reuealed
in the VVord, Rom.
12. 3. Bee wise to sobriety.
            
            3. Vnprofitable reasonings,
such as were those about
Genealogies, in the Apostles
time, 1. Tim. 1.
            Thirdly, If thou be asked
a reason of the hope
that is in thee, by such as
haue authority to require
it, or need to seeke it, then
answer: But be sure to remember
two things; namely,
that thou answer with
all reuerence, as may shew
how much thou art affected
with the Maiestie of

Gods truth, and withall
with meeknesse, that is,
without passion or frowardnesse:
and without
affectation, or conceitednesse,
or wilfulnes in thine
owne opinions, 1. Pet. 3. 15.
            Fourthly, let thy communication
be yea, yea, and nay,
nay: otherwise, customary
and vaine swearing, is a
most damned sinne, and
such as God will surely
plague.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XX.
            Rules that shew vs how to
carry our selues in company,
in respect of the faults
of others.
            THus of our carriage
in company in respect
of Religion.How wee must behaue our selues in company concerning the faults of others. Now concerning
the faultes of others,
wee must obserue
these Rules:
            First, wee must neuer in
our discourse iustifie the
wicked, or condemn the righteous;
all excesse in words
is euill, but this is an abomination
to the Lord: We
must euer honour those that

feare the Lord, and as for
vile persons, they are to bee
contemned, Psal. 15. 4. Amos
5. 15. Prou▪
                17. 15.
            Secondly, let thy conuersation
and discourse be
without iudging, Math. 7. 1.
lam. 3. 17. It is time exceeding
ill-spent, that is spent
in censuring of others.
And the rather should we
take heed of iudging, if
we consider how the holy
Ghost hath matched that
sin in that place of Iames,
wee must bee without iudging,
without hypocrisie: as if
he wold signifie, that great
Censurers are commonly
great Hypocrites; and as

any are more wise, they
are more sparing of their
Censures.
            Thirdly, thou must not
walke about with tales; take
heed of Tale-bearing: He
goeth about as a slanderer,
that reuealeth a secret,
though it be true hee speaketh.
It is a maruellous euill
custome, that many
haue to fill vp their discourse
with the report of
the frailties of others,
which they by some
meanes or other, come
vnder-hand to know: This
is an euill frequently condemned
in Scripture, and
yet most vsually practised;

as if it were lawfull to
speake of any thing which
they know to be true: Thou
shalt not walke about with
Tales, nor stand against the
bloud of thy neighbour: A
strange connexion, by
which the Lord imports,
that this Tale-bearing is a
kind of murther; and it is
true in the case of many a
man; thou wert as good
lay violent hands vpon
him, as with that licentiousnesse
of words to diuulge
tales concerning
him, Prou. 20. 19. & 11. 13.
Leuit. 19. 16. And for the
better strengthening of
this rule, thou art yet charged

to looke to thy eares
too, as well as thy tongue;
Thou must not receiue euill
reports against thy neighbour,
but make it appeare,
thou art not pleased with
such Tales, Psal. 15. 3.
Yea, thou art forbidden
the society of such persons,
as carry Tales; Thou
must not meddle with Talebearers,
nor with such as
flatter with their lippes;
Certainely such creatures
commonly flatter the present,
and reproach the absent,
Prou. 20. 19.
            Fourthly, if thou do
know an offence in any,
with whom thou conuersest,

               thou shalt not hate him
in thy heart,
               Reproue, but hate not. 
               but rather reproue
him plainely: For,
he that rebuketh a man, shall
afterward finde more fauour
then hee that flattereth with
his tongue, Leu. 19. 17. Prou.
28. 23.
            Fifthly,Passe by meere frailties. as for the meere
frailtie of others, hold thy
tongue, passe by them: A
foole despiseth his neighbour,
but a man of vnderstanding
will hold his peace, Prou. 11.
12. Commonly they that
haue most defects themselues,
are aprest to contemne
others for their
weakenesses: but a wise
man must so distinguish of

the faults of others, that
hee couer meere frailties,
and learne of God to passe
by the infirmities of his
seruants: The Antithesis
shewes, that a wise man
doth not' onely hold his
tongue, but restraine his
thoughts from thinking
the worse of others for
such infirmities.
            Sixthly, against the passions
& wrongs of others
thou must arme thy selfe
with a soft answer, and bee
sure thou render not euill for
euill, Prou. 15. 1. 1. Thess. 5.
15. or rebuke for rebuke,
1. Pet. 3. 9.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XXI.
            Rules that shew vs how to
carry our selues in company,
and not giue offence.
            THus of our carriage
towards others in cō
               pany,
as it respects their
faults: Now followeth the
third sort of rules,Rules that concerne the in-offensiuenes of our carriage in company. which
orderour behauior toward
others in company in respect
of in-offensiuenesse. It
ought to be our principall
care to carry our selues so,
as no body may take offence
at vs.
            Now these rules may
be directed to their heads,

as they concerne,

                  of our behauior
toward others.
                  1. The humility,
                  2. The discretion,
                  3. The purity,
               
            
            Wee must carry our
selues humbly, discreetly,
and honestly in our conuersation
with others, so
shall wee conuerse with
much amiablenesse, and
reputation:
            First,A humble behauiou
                     •
                   hath three thing in it. vnto the humility
of our conuersation belong
these Rules:
            1. First, bee soft, shew all
meekenesse to all men, restraining
the inordination
of thy heart, endeuouring
to shew thy selfe gentle,
and peaceable, and harmelesse,
               
and easie to be entreated,
Tit. 3. 1, 2. Prou. 8. 13.
Iam. 3. 13.
            2. Secondly, thou must
bow downe thine eare, and
heare the words of the wise,
and apply thine heart to
get knowledge, and profit
thy selfe by others, Pro. 23.
17. This is the same with
that of Iames, Bee swift to
heare, and slow to speak, I am.
3. 19.
            3. Thirdly, put not forth
thy selfe, nor stand in the
place of great men, till
thou bee called, Prou. 25. 6.
            In generall, concerning
humility, the Apostle Peters
phrase is much to bee

noted, hee saith, we should
cloath our selues with humility:
which notes both the
great measure of it, it
should couer all our actions,
and also the continuance
of it: When wee go
amongst men, wee should
stirre vp our hearts, and
fashion our selues to expresse
this grace, and not
dare to bee seene without
humility, no more then
we would bee seene without
our cloathes. Humility
hides our nakednesse,
and pride and passion lay
it open to the view and
contempt of others.
            2. Secondly, neither is

humility all that is required
to make our conuersation
without offence,Eight rules that concerne discretion in our behauiour. or
prouocation; but we must
also carry our selues discretely,
and to this end
there are these excellent
Rules:
            First, thou must consider
to speake what is acceptable,
and auoide what
may irritate; there is singular
vse of this rule, if it
were followed, Prou. 10. 32,
13. & 13. 23.
            Secondly, thou must
marke those that cause diuision
and offences, and auoide
them, and shunne the societie
of such, Rom. 16. 17, 18.

This will breed thee much
peace, and deliuer thee
from much suspition in others.
            Thirdly, thou must make
no friendship with the angry
man; for either by
much conuersing with
him, thou maist learne his
waies, or else it will bee a
snare to thee, that thou
shalt neither know how to
keep his fauour, nor yet
how to breake off from
him, without much vnrest
and inconueniences, Prou.
22. 24, 25.
            Fourthly, it is a great
discretion in euill time to
be silent. In things wherein

thou maist indanger thy
selfe, and not profite others,
it is thy best way, and
a wise course, to forbeare
speech of such things, Amos
5. 13.
            Fifthly, so likewise it is
thy discretion in matters
of danger to forbeare the
communioating of thy secrets
to any, though thou
mightst bee tempted to a
perswasion of trust in
those, to whom thou
wouldst reueale them: It
may often repent thee to
haue spoken, but seldome
to haue held thy peace,
Micah 7. 5.
            Sixthly, with-draw thy

feete from thy neighbours
house, left hee bee weary of
thee and hate thee: This is
an excellent rule giuen by
Salomon, Pro. 25. 17. If thou
wouldest conuerse with reputation,
take heed of idle
gadding from house to
house, when thou hast no
occasion or employment:
Thou maist draw hereby
much secret contempt, and
loathing of thee, when thy
emptinesse and vanity shal
be thereby discouered. An
empty conuersation, that
hath in it no exercise of piety
or vertue, if it be frequent,
occasioneth secret,
and vnutterable scorne.
            
               7. Restraine thine owne
passions in conuersing.
There are none so wise,
but if they shew their passions
of immoderate anger,
feare, griefe; yea, or
ioy, but they discouer
much weakenesses in their
disposition, which would
bee couered if thou didst
bridle the excesse of thy
passions. A wise man couereth
shame, when a foole is
presently knowne: It is the
best praise not to haue
such weakenesses; but the
next to this, is by discretiō
to bridle our selues, so as
wee may hide our weakenesses
from breaking out.
            
               Lastly, thou maist make
good vse of that direction
of Salomon about thy
friend, Blesse not thy friend
with a loud voyee, rising early
in the morning; for it
may bee accounted a curse to
thee: Take heed of flattery,
which in stead of effecting
thine owne ends, may
bring thee out of all respect.
Hee doth not forbid
the iust praise, and encouragement
of friends,
but the intending of praise
of purpose to the vttermost
notice of thy friend
(this is to praise him with
a loud voice) and the affectation
of preuenting others

in praising; and of
doing it in such things as
are not yet sufficiently
knowne to bee praise-worthy,
and to set ones
selfe so to praise, as if hee
studied to do nothing else,
but humour his friends, especially
if it bee but once
perceiued, that thou dost
it but for thy owne ends.
It is a great part of wisedom,
to know how to speak
of the praise of others, so
as neither sinister ends bee
intended, nor the humoring
of those we praise: to
doe it sparingly and seasonably,
is a great discretion.
            And thus of the Rules,

that make our conuersation
amiable, in respect of
discretion.
            3. Thirdly,Three Rules that concerne the purity of our cō
                  uersation. that our conuersation
may not be hurtfull
and offensiue, we must
looke to the purity of it,
and so these Rules following
are of singular vse:
            First, in generall, Refraine
thy tongue from euill,
and thy lippes that they
speake not guile, Psal. 34.
13. For hee that keepeth his
mouth, keepeth his soule, Pro.
22. 23. Take heed of the
vsuall vices of the tongue:
for thereout may come much
mischiefe, and discontent
to thy selfe and others.
            
               Secondly, in particular
looke to thy selfe carefully,
that thou auoide those
three euils mentioned by
the Apostle: Ephes. 3. 4.
viz. Filthy speaking, Foolish
talking and iesting. By
iesting hee meanes those
biting iests, that vnder pretence
of shewing wittinesse,
or conceit, doe secretly
leaue disgrace vpon
the persons whom they
concerne.
            Thirdly, auoide with detestation
the excess
                     •
                   in drinking
and reuelling, and suffer
thy selfe vpon no pretence,
to be drawne to giue
way to thine owne practice

in them, 1. Pet. 4. 3.
         
         
            CHAP. XXII.
            How wee must carrie our
selues out of company.
            THus of thy carryage
in generall in company.
Now out of company
thou must looke to these
things:
            1. First, thou must fashion
thy heart,The rules that order vs out of companie. by the vse
of all good meanes, to the
loue of all sorts of men.
This 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , loue of
me
                  •
               , is a vertue little
thought on: yet greatly
necessarie, as a foundation

of all practices in conuersing
with others, and wee
should labour to abound
in loue towards all men, 1.
Thes. 3. 12.
            Secondly, remember to
pray for all sorts of men:
This is a precept giuen vs
in charge by the Apostle,
1. Tim. 2. 1. and belongs to
this place, and wee ought
to make conscience of it
according to the occasions
of our callings, or acquaintance
with other
men: we should euen in
secret seeke to profit our
neighbours by praying for
them.
            Thirdly, we should prouide,

euen out of company
to order our affaires so, as
that we may liue,
            1. Honestly without scandall,
1. Cor. 10. 32. Phil.
1. 10.
            2. Iustly, without deceit
or fraudulent dealing, Leu.
19. 35. 36. 1. Thes. 4. 16.
            3. Peaceably without strise
with any, if it be possible,
Prou. 3. 29, 30. Zach. 7. 10.
Hebr. 12. 14.
         
         
            CHAP. XXIII.
            Rules about workes of
Mercy.
            HItherto of the rules,
that concerne righteousnesse.
            
               Mercy followeth.
Now in shewing mercie,
diuers things are charged
vpon vs.
            First,8. Things required in shewing mercy. 1. Willingnesse. 
               Willingnesse. We
must giue cheerefully: For
the Lord loueth a cheerefull
giuer. We must loue mercy,
as well as shew mercy. Our
hearts should bee euer answerable
to our power.
We must be ready, and prepared
to shew mercy, abhorring
delaies, and putting
off of time, or seeking
excuses: Our eares should
bee open to the cries of the
poore, rather then bee behinde
hand; we should sell,
that wee might giue almes,
               
Mich. 6. 8. 1. Tim. 6. 18.
2. Cor. 9. 4, 5, 6, 7. Pro. 22.
23, 13. Luke 12. 33. Pro. 3.
27, 28.
            Secondly,2. Labour. 
               Labour and
Diligence. Wee should
take paines, and work hard
according to all the occasions
of mercy. This is the Apostles
phrase: God will not
forget your worke, and labour
of loue, Heb. 6. 10. We must
bee forward to doe those
workes of mercy, that require
our paines and trauaile
about them, as well
as those we may doe and
sit still, 2. Cor. 8. 16, 22.
            Thirdly,3. Liberalitie. 
               Liberalitie: We
must open our hands wide,

               Deut. 15. 8. wee must bee
rich in those good workes,
1. Tim. 6. 18. we must no
                  •
               
               giue sparingly, 2. Cor. 9. 6.
we must giue to our power,
and sometimes beyond our
power: 2. Cor. 8. 2. wee
should desire to answere
the expectation had of our
bounty, especially the expectation
of our teachers
that know vs and our estates,
2. Cor. 8. 24. wee
should striue to abound in
this grace also, as well as in
other graces of the Spirit,
2. Cor. 8. 9. we should giue
to seuen, and also to eight,
Eccles. 11. 2. we must make
good measure, yea and pressed

downe, Luke 6. 8.
            
               Fourthly,
               4. Humilitie. Humilitie shewed fiue waies in doing workes of mercy. 
               Humility. There
is great vse of humility, in
shewing mercy. Now we
should shew our humilitie
diuers waies about mercie:
As
            First, in helping others,
without exalting our
selues, and dominiering ouer
them. The rich must not
thinke to rule the poore, and
to command them, as if
they were their vassals: we
should so shew mercy, as
not to stand vpon tearmes
of their beholdingnesse, to
whom wee shew mercie,
Prou. 22. 7.
            Secondly, in not despising

the poore; we must no
                  •
               
thinke of them meanely,
and contemptuously, because
they stand in neede
of our help, whether it be
in bodie or minde, Prou.
14. 21.
            Thirdly, in accepting exhortation,
shewing our
selues willing to be called
vpon, and stirred vp to
mercie, 2. Cor. 8. 17.
            4. By our penitencie, whē
we goe to God, after wee
haue done our best, and
confesse the corruption
that cleaues vnto vs, euen
when we haue shewed our
best desires to communicate
to others, and withall

striuing to plow vp the fallow
ground of our hard harts,
that they may bee more fit
to expresse the bowels of
mercy, Hos. 10. 12.
            Fiftly, the Macedonians
shewed their humilitie in
this, that they prayed the Apostle
to accept their gifts, giuing
themselues also to bee
disposed of to the Lord, and
vnto them by the vvill of
God, 2. Cor. 8. 5.
            Thus of the humility
to bee shewed in doing
workes of mercy.
            A fift thing required in
shewing mercie,5. Faith in two respects. is Faith;
and faith is needfull in two
respects.
            
               First, to beleeue Gods
acceptation of the mercy
shewed. For a godly Christian,
that is not vaine-glorious,
hath so meane an opinion
of his best workes,
that he findes neede to flie
to Gods promises, and
dares not trust vpon his
owne goodnes. Now God
hath promised to accept
of that we doe, if there be
a willing minde: The will is
accepted for the deed, 2. Cor.
8. 12.
            Secondly, to beleeue the
successe and reward from
God, and that wee shall
not lose, by what is so expē
               ded.
Though the persons

to whom we shew mercy,
should bee so vngratefull,
that it were as bread cast on
the waters: yet wee ought
to beleeue, that our seede
cast on the waters, shall
bring vs a plentifull haruest,
Eccles. 11. 1. And it is
certaine, whatsoeuer the
persons be, yet what is giuen,
is sowed. And if the
Husbandman doe not
thinke his come spoiled,
that he casts vpon his land,
no more ought a Christian
to think that to be lost,
that is giuen to the poore.
Nature may disappoint
the hope of the Husbandman,
but in works of mercie,

there is no venture, but
a sure increase from the
Lord, 2. Cor. 9. 9, 10. and
therefore our faith should
make vs get bags to put vp
the certaine treasure wee
shall gaine by mercy from
the Lord, Luke 12. 33.
            A sixt thing required in
shewing mercie,6. Discretion in four
                     •
                   things. is discretion,
and discretion should
shew it selfe
            First, by distributing
our almes in the fittest
course wee can, hauing a
principall respect to godly
poore. He that sheweth mercy,
ought to haue a good eye,
Prou. 22. 9.
            Secondly, by obseruing

our owne abilitie, so to ease
others, that we burthen not
our selues, 1. Cor. 9. 14, 15.
            Thirdly, by taking heed
that wee spend not vpon
the rich by needlesse entertainments,
what ought
to bee bestowed vpon the
poore, Prou. 22. 16. Luke
14. 13.
            Fourthly, by auoiding
scandal, or giuing offence,
that none blame vs in our aboundance,
but prouiding
things honest in the sight of
God and men, 2. Cor. 8. 20,
21. yet so as wee indeuour
in an holy & discreet manner
to prouoke others by our
zeale, 2. Cor. 9. 2.
            
               A seuenth thing required
in shewing mercy, is
Sympathy,
               7. Sympathy. Pitie, a Fellow-feeling
of the distresses of
others, being like affectioned
and laying their miseries
to heart, Heb. 13. 3. Col. 3.
12. Rom. 12. 16. Iob 30. 25.
There should be bowels in
our mercy.
            
            The last thing is Sinceritie.
               8. Sinceritie in fiue things.
Now this sinceritie
should bee shewed diuers
waies, As:
            1. In the matter of our
almes. It must be of goods
well gotten. For God hateth
robbery, though it were
for burnt offerings, Esay
61. 8.
            
               2. In the maner we must
shew mercy, without wicked
thoughts, or griefe of
heart, Deut. 7. 7, 8. to 12.
and without hiding our selues
from the poore, Esay 58. 7.
and without excuse to shift
off the doing of it, Prou.
24. 11, 12.
            3. In the ends. That we
doe not our workes to bee
seene of men, or to merit of
God: but with an vnfained
desire to glorifie God, and
make our profession to be
well spoken of, and shew
the true loue and pitie wee
beare to the creature in
distresse, Math. 6. 2. Cor.
9. 19.
            
               4. In continuing our
mercy; not forgetting to distribute,
but still remembring
the poore, Heb. 13. 16.
Galat. 2. soundly performing
the mercy with constancie,
which wee haue
purposed, willed, or promised.
It were an excellent
order, if Christians
would follow the Apostles
rule, euery weeke, as God
hath prospered them, to lay
aside for the poore, 1. Cor. 1.
16. 2. 2. Cor. 8. 11.
            5. In the kindes of mercie,
that wee bee ready to
shew spirituall mercy, as wel
as corporall, and in corporall
mercy to doe good all

the waies we can, as well as
one way: As by lending,
protecting, releasing, visiting,
and giuing; and thus
to the poore, to such as are
fallen into decay, and to
the strangers also: as many
Scriptures require.
         
         
            CHAP. XXIIII.
            Rules that shew vs how to
carry our selues towards
wicked men.
            HItherto of the rules
that concerne al men:
Now the particular rules
direct our carriage either
toward wicked men,

or toward godly men.
            Our conuersation toward
wicked men may be ordered
by these rules:
            First,Needlesse societie with them must be auoided. we must auoide all
needlesse societie with them,
and shunne their infectious
fellowship, especially
wee must take heed of any
speciall familiaritie vvith
them, or vnequall yoaking
our selues with them, by
marriage, friendship, or
leagues of amitie, Psal. 1.
1. 1. Cor. 6. 17. Eph. 5. 7, 11.
Prou. 23. 20. & 4. 14, &c.
            Secondly,Great wisdome required in cōuersing with them. when wee
haue occasion to conuerse
with them, wee must study
how to walke wisely towards
               
them, so as we may
bee so farre from giuing
scandall, as if it bee possible,
we may winne them to
glorifie God and his truth
in our profession. It requires
much skill to order
our selues aright in
those things that are to be
done in the presence of
wicked men, or in such
things, as must come by
report vnto them, and
their scanning. Now there
are diuers things of admirable
vse in our carriage to
put them to silence,Diuers things that affect the hearts euen of the worst men, are and to
make them in their consciences
at least to thinke
well of vs: Such as are:
            
               1. Mortification.
               1. A mortified life. A sound
care to reforme our waies,
and true hatred and griefe
for our owne sinnes, will
cause many times wicked
wretches to say of vs, that
wee are the people of the
Lord, Esay 61. 3, 8. I say, a
sound care of reformation
for to professe a mortified
life, and yet in any
thing to shew, that we can
liue in any fault vvithout
repentance, this prouokes
them exceedingly to speak
euill of the good way of
God. Therefore the first
care of a Christian, that
would be rightly ordered
toward wicked men, must

be to liue without offence,
and to discouer a true mortified
minde, and a heart
broken for sinne.
            Secondly,2. Reuerend speech of Religion. to speake
with all reuerence, and feare,
when wee intreat of matters
of Religion, much amazeth
the prophane conscience
of a wicked man.
Whereas cursorie discourses
of such grand mysteries,
and empty and
vaine ianglings doe exceedingly
occasion a confirmed
wilfulnesse, and prophanenesse
in such men,
1. Pet. 3. 16. & Prou. 24. 26.
            Thirdly,3. Meekenesse of wisedome. it is a most
winning quality in all our

carriage, to shew meekenesse
of wisedome to expresse a
minde well gouerned, free
from passions, and also
from conceitednesse, frowardnesse,
affectation, and
the vaine shew of what we
haue not in vs in substance.
For each of these haue in
them singular matter of
irritation, and prouoke
wicked men to scorne, and
hatred, and reuiling.
            Fourthly,4. Reseruednesse in foure things. there is a holy
kinde of Reseruednesse,
which may adorne the life
of a Christian in his carriage
among wicked men:
And this Reseruednesse is
to be shewed:
            
               1. In not trusting our
selues too farre with them,
not beleeuing euery word,
not bearing our selues vpon
euery shew of fauour
from them. For as too
much suspition of them
breeds extreame alienation,
if they perceiue it: so
credulitie is no way safe:
Pro. 14. 15. Iohn 2. 24.
            2. By abstaining from
iudging of them that are
without. It is a most intemperate
zeale, that
spends it selfe in the vaine
and bootelesse censure of
the estate of those that
are without. Those censures
haue in them matter

of prouocation, and
nothing of edification. It
were happie for some
Christians, if they could
with the Apostle say often
to their owne soules, What
haue I to doe to iudge them,
that are without? 1. Cor. 5.
12, 13.
            3. By studying to be quiet,
and meddle vvith our
owne businesse, casting about,
how to cut off all occasions,
by wch we might
be intangled with any discord,
or contentions, or
much businesse with them.
It is a godly ambition to
thirst after this quietnesse
of life, 1. Thes. 4. 12.
            
               4. By our silence in euill
times, alwaies auoiding all
such discourses, as might
bring vs into danger, without
any calling for our
owne edification, or the
edification of others. Many
a man hath smarted
sorely for want of this bridle
for his tongue, when
his words could doe no
good to others, and
much hurt to himselfe, Amos
5. 13. Dauid held his
peace while the wicked
were present, Psal. 39. 1.
            5. In forbearing to reproue
scorners, Prou. 9. 7, 8.
& 23. 9.
            6. In seasoning the

words with salt, so as they
discouer not vanity, lightnesse,
vaine-glory, malice,
or desire of reuenge, or the
like faultes in their speeches.
            7. In answering the
foole, but not according to
his folly, that is, not in such
pride, passion, or reuiling
fashion, as the foole obiects
in, Prou. 26. 4, 5.
            8. In getting out of
their company, when we
perceiue not in them the
words of wisedome: If wee
see they grow once to bee
peruerse, outragious, or
wilfull in any notorious
offence of words or works,

we must get from amongst
them.
            Thus of the eight waies
wherein wee should
shew reseruednesse: they
are of excellent vse, if
men would study them,
and practise them.
            5. Mercy5. Mercy. is amiable euen
in the eies of wicked
men: and mercifull Christians,
that are full of good
workes, doe bring a great
deale of honour to Religion:
It is true Religion, and
vndefiled, to visite the fatherlesse,
and widowes, and
to be vnspotted of the world:
A conuersation, that is
vnrebukeable, and full of

mercy also, cannot but be
very honorable: whereas
Religion it selfe, when it is
seated in the brests of
such Christians, as haue
forgotten to shew mercy,
and do not study how to
be doing good to others,
is exceedingly darkened
in the glory of it, and many
times extremely ill spoken
of: A true Christian
should hold it a great disparagement,
that any Papist,
or carnall man in the
world (in equall comparison)
should put them
downe, for either the tendernesse,
or the aboundance
of workes of mercy,

1. Pet. 2. 12. Math. 15. Iam.
3. 25.
            6. When wee haue
cause,6. Vndauntednesse in a good cause. & a calling to speak
for the truth, or to reproue
sinne, it is an excellent
grace to bee vndaunted,
& free from seruile feares,
flatterie: To giue place
to wicked men in Gods
cause, or to feare their faces
in the quarrell of Religion,
or to shew a minde
that would repent of wel-doing,
or that basely
would stoupe some way to
honour vngodly persons
for our owne ends, is so
farre from gaining true fauour
with euill minded

men, that it makes them
to scorne and hate vs, and
Religion so much the
more: whereas a godly
man, that is vnmoueable,
& refuseth to praise the wicked,
or iustifie the vngodly,
and when hee hath cause,
will contend with them, as
Salomons phrase is, and not
be like a troubled fountain,
or a corrupt spring: hee
may for the time receiue
ill words from the wicked,
but his heart is afraid of
him, and his conscience
doth admire him, Pro. 24.
25. & 28. 4. & 25. 26. 1. Cor.
16. 22.
            7. The like aduantage

is brought to the conuersatiō
               7. Patience in affliction.
of a godly man, when
hee can shew like patience,
and firmenesse of minde,
in bearing all sorts of afflictions,
and crosses. Patience
in affliction makes a
great shew before a wicked
man, that well knowes
how vnable he is so to carrie
himselfe, 1. Pet. 3. 14.
            8. Lastly, to loue our enemies,
and shew it by our
fruits in forgiuing them, or
being ready heartily to
pleasure them, and ouercome
their euill with goodnesse:
To pray for them,
when they reuile and persecute
vs, is a transcendent

vertue; euill men themselues
being Iudges, Luke
6. 27. to 31. Prou. 20. 22.
         
         
            CHAP. XXV.
            Rules that shew vs how to
carry our selues towards
godly men.
            THus of our carriage
toward the wicked:
how we should carry our
selues toward the godly,
followeth to bee considered
of:
            The summe of all is,
that wee must walke in loue:
If wee can soundly discharge
our duety to the

godly, in respect of louing
them vnfaignedly & heartily,
and constantly, wee
performe all that is required
of vs toward them:
And this loue to the godly
is so necessarie, as that
it is imposed vpon vs, as
the onely Commandement
giuen by Christ, who
in one word tels vs the substance
of our duties, Ioh.
13. 34. Ephe. 5. 2. 1. Pet. 2. 17.
1. Cor. 16. 14.
            Now the Rules which
in particular binde vs to
the good behauiour in respect
of our loue to the
godly, concerne either
the manifestation of our loue

to them: or the preseruation
of our loue to them.
            
            Wee must shew our
loue to the godly diuers
waies:Six waies of manifesting our loue to the godly.
            
            First,1. By courtesie. by courtesie and
kindnesse towards them,
and that in a speciall manner,
being affectioned toward
them with a brotherly
loue and kindenesse. No
brethren in nature should
shew more kindnesse one
to another, then Christians
should, Eph. 4. 33. Rom.
12. 10.
            Secondly,2. By receiuing them. by receiuing
and entertaining them: we
must receiue one another,
and be harberous one to another;
               
and this with intirenesse
of affection: Negatiuely,
it must bee without
grudging, 1. Pet. 4. 9. Affirmatiuely,
we must receiue
one another, as Christ receiued
vs into glory, that is:
First, without respect of desert;
Wee haue done nothing
to deserue heauen;
yet Christ hath receiued
vs to glory: so, though the
godly haue not pleasured
vs any way greatly, yet
because they are the children
of God, we should
make much of them, and
entertaine them gladly.
Secondly, not thinking any
thing too deare for them:
               
Christ hath not enuied vs
the very glory of heauen,
and therefore what can we
doe to the brethren, that
should answer the example
of Christ? Rom. 15. 7.
            Thirdly, by bearing their
burthens;
               3. By bearing their burthens. for so we should
fulfill the Law of Christ,
Gal. 6. 2. There are two
sorts of burthens presse the
godly: One inward, such
as are temptations, and
their owne corruptions;
the other outward, such as
are afflictions of all sorts:
Now in both these, this
rule holds; for when wee
see a godly Christian
mourne and lament his

distresse in respect of his
infirmities or temptations,
wee must beare his burthen,
not by soothing him
in his sinne, as if it were
no sinne, but by laying his
griefe to our owne hearts,
and striuing to comfort
him with the promises of
God. This is not to make
our selues guilty of their
sinnes, or to beare with
their sinnes, but to helpe
them out of their griefe
by consolation, out of
their sinne by direction.
Note,Note. that this is charged
vpon vs, when sinne is a
burthen to them, not before;
for till then wee are

rather to reprooue them,
or admonish them: But
then we are to take notice
of this Rule, when they
confesse their sinnes, and
are weary of them, and
sorry for them: And thus
also in their outward burthens
we must beare them
by comforting them, and
aduising them, and helping
them, and shewing
our affection to them, as if
it were our owne case, so
farre as we haue a calling,
and power to help them.
            Fourthly,4. By prouoking them to good duties. by considering
one another, to prouoke unto
loue, and good workes,
Heb 10. 24. Note the dutie

and the manner how it is
to be done: The duty is,
to stirre vp others all wee
can to the increase of
loue and aboundance of
all good workes: the manner
is shewed two waies;
First, wee must prouoke
them to it, both by example,
and by exhortation,
and all good waies, that
might fire in them the desire
of well-doing. Secondly,
we must consider
one another, wee must study
the estates of others,
their wants, impediments,
meanes, gifts, callings, &c.
and accordingly apply our
selues for the best aduantage

to helpe them forward.
It is not enough to
doe it occasionally, but
wee must meditate of it,
and cast about, how,
where, and when we must
yeeld this helpe, and incouragement,
and furtherance.
            Fifthly,5. By faithfulnesse in all their businesse. by doing whatsoeuer
wee do for the godly,
heartily, and with all faithfulnesse,
as if it were for
our selues, or our owne
brethren, or kinred in nature,
not being slothfull
in seruice; or such as disappoint
the trust reposed
in vs: wee should doe all
things wee vndertake for.

them, with all fidelity and
care, 3. Ioh. 5. Rom. 12. 6, 7,
8, 11. Yea, we should care
for their good and profit,
as wee would care for the
good of the members of
our owne body: for such
are they to vs in the Mysticall
Body of Iesus Christ,
as the former place to the
Romanes sheweth.
            Lastly,6. By imploying our gifts for their good. we should shew
our loue to the godly, by
employing the gifts of our
minde, as may be best for
their good: As euery man
hath receiued the gift, hee
must so minister the same,
as good Stewards of the manifold
grace of God. There

are diuersity of gifts in the
godly, as knowledge, vtterance,
prayer, and the like▪
Now these are giuen to profite
withall, 1. Pet. 4. 10.
1. Cor. 12. As for example,
The lippes of the wise must
disperse knowledge, Pro. 15.
7. So when Christians
meete together, as any haue
receiued a Doctrine, or a
Psalme, or an Interpretation:
so must hee minister it
for the profite of others, 1.
Cor. 14. 26. and so must we
help one another by
prayer, either absent, or
present, 2. Cor. 1. 11.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XXVI.
            How wee should preserue our
loue to the godly.
            THus of the Rules
that concerne the manifestation
of our loue to
the godly: Now there are
further diuers things to
bee obserued for the preseruation
of our loue to
them: and these may bee
cast into two heads: for,
they are either such things
as wee must doe; or, such
things as wee must auoide.
            The things that we must

do to preserue loue are
these.What wee must do to preseru
                     •
                   our loue to the godly. Wee must labour to be of one iudgment with them
            
            First, wee must striue to
be like minded in matters
of opinion; many discords
or abatements of affection
grow among Christians
for their differences of
opinion in diuers things.
It is true, that difference
of Iudgement should not
cause difference in affection:
If wee cannot bee of
one minde, yet wee should
bee of one heart; yet wee
see the contrary, and
therefore euery Christian
should make conscience
of it, to bee so wary and
so humble in his opinions,

especially in things doubtfull,
or not so necessarie,
as to take heed of admitting,
who might shew
dissent from the godly; or
if hee must needs dissent,
yet to bee very wary how
hee discouer it to the vexation,
or entanglement of
others. Now because this
is very hard to perswade
Christians vnto, marke
how vehemently the Apostle
speakes of it, Rom. 15.
5, 6. Now the God of patience
and consolation grant
you to be like minded, that
yee may with one mouth and
one minde glorifie God. We
must learne of the Apostle

to pray feruently for
this, that our natures, and
the natures of others, with
whom wee conuerse, may
bee fitted hereunto: and
1. Cor. 1. 10. the Apostle
adiures them by the name
of Iesus: I beseech you, brethren,
by the name of our
Lord Iesus Christ, that yee
all speake the same thing,
and that there be no diuisions
amongst you, but that
yee bee perfectly ioyned together
in the same minde,
and in the same iudgement.
And in the Epistle to the
Philippians cha. 2. ver. 1, 2, 3.
Hee vrgeth them with
strange vehemency to import

the necessitie of this
duty: If, saith he, there bee
any consolation in Christ, or
any fellowship of the Spirit,
or any bowels of mercy, bee
like minded, hauing the
same loue, being of one
minde. And certainely,
this earnestnesse in requiring
this duety, imports,
that some peruerse Christians
will smoke one day,
for their presumption and
waywardnesse, and pride
of opinions.
            2. Wee must follow the
things,2. We must follow peace. which may make for
outward peace; and to this
end wee must labour to
shew all meeknesse in our

carriage, and long-suffering
in for-bearing one another,
and forgiuing one another,
Ephes. 4. 2, 3, 4.
            3. Wee must striue to
heate our affections to
such a degree,3. We must couer their weaknesse as that it
may be able to couer the infirmaties
of others: Hee
must get a couering loue,
that will liue constantly in
the loue of the godly: A
loue, that will couer a multitude
of faults, 1. Pet. 4. 8.
Prou. 10. 12.
            4. We must confesse our
faults one to another,We must confesse our faults one to another. I am. 5.
16. It doth exceedingly
preserue loue, if men,
when they haue offended,

or wronged others, would
quickly, and easily, and
heartily acknowledge their
offences: Nor doth this
rule hold in case of trespasse
onely, but when we
haue not wronged others,
yet discreetly to complaine
of the corruption
of nature that cleaues to
vs, and the infirmities
which daily trouble vs:
This doth work not onely
compassion, but great increase
of affection in others
towards vs: For acknowledgement
preuents
their secret loathing of vs
for such frailties, if they
should discouer them.

And besides, it makes
them the willinger to giue
vs leaue to reproue their
faults, when they see wee
are as willing to reproue
our owne; Besides the
ease it brings to our owne
hearts many times to
make our moane to others,
when our consciences
are
troubled.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XXVII.
            What wee must auoide, that
our loue may bee preserued.
            THus of what we must
doe to preserue loue;10. Things to bee auoided.
Now further, that loue
may be preserued amongst
the godly, these things following
are to be auoided.
            First,1. Suits in Law. 
               Suites in Law; A
Christian must haue many
considerations of his
cause, before it can be lawfull
for him to goe to law
with his brother; These
kinds of contentions are

most vnnaturall amongst
Christians, and proue not
only scandalous in respect
of others, but extreamely
grieuous and poisonous to
themselues, 1. Cor. 6. 1, 4.
            Secondly,2. Dissimulation. 
               Dissimulatition:
our loue must be without
faining, in deede, and in
truth, not in shew, or in
words, Rom. 12. 9. 1. Iohn
3. 18.
            Thirdly, Conceitednesse.
               3. Conceitednesse.
This is a vice, that extreamely
vexeth others,
and alienateth affection:
wee must not be vvise in
our selues, but rather in
lowlinesse of minde esteeme
another better then our

selues, and shew it both by
making our selues equall to
them of the lower sort, and
by going before others in
giuing Honour and Praise,
Rom. 12. 10, 16. Phil 2. 4.
Pro. 12. 15.
            Fourthly, reioicing in
iniquitie. Our loue must
be holy and pure, if wee
would haue it preserued.
It must haue nothing in
it, that is vnseemely, nor
must it bee an affection,
that will take pleasure in
the vices, or faults of those,
with whom wee conuerse,
1. Cor. 13. 5, 6.
            Fiftly,5. Worldlinesse and selfe-loue. 
               The minding of
our owne things: wee must

not study for our selues,
and our owne ends onely
in conuersing, 1. Cor 13. 5.
The meaning is not, that
wee should leaue our callings,
and our houses, to
spend the greatest part of
our time in our neighbours
houses, but he prohibits,
First, Worldlinesse,
and excessiue cares about
our businesse, and the
things of this life, which
hinders needfull societie
with the godly: and secondly,
hee forbids selfe-loue
in conuersing, when
men in all things aime at
their owne profit, or pleasure,
or credit, and doe

not as well seeke the good
of others: we may minde
our owne things, but not
onely.
            6. Sixtly,6. Ficklenesse. 
               Ficklenesse
and Vnconstancie: we must
looke to it, that brotherly
loue continue, Heb. 13. 1.
and to this end wee must
looke to the leuitie of our
owne natures, and striue
to make good, by continuance,
the affection wee
haue conceiued and professed
to others. Some
are of such vnconstant dispositions,
that they will
loue vehemently for a fit,
and suddenly fall off without
reason, but not without

singular shame, and
blemishing of their reputations.
For such tempers
are hardly fit for any
societie. Now this must
bee repented of, and refonned.
            Seuenthly,7. Vaineglory. wee must
take heede of vaine-glory,
and an ouer-eager desire
of credit and estimation
aboue others. For this is
the cause of much vnrest
in our owne hearts, and of
much interruption in brotherly
loue. And vvhy
wouldest thou be so highly
esteemed of? Thou
considerest not the hard
taske thou layest vpon thy

selfe, to bee euer carefull
to answere that great
praise, or estimation thou
desirest: Nor markest
thou, how thereby thou
art made to offend against
thy brother: by enuying
him, by backbiting; or other
waies of prouocation,
nor yet how little this
commends thee to God,
Gal. 5. 26.
            Eightly,8. Iudging. take heede of
iudging thy brethren, not
but that thou maist say,
that sinne is sinne, but
looke to thy selfe in two
things:
            First, that thou censure
not thy brother about

things indifferent, or
doubtfull: such as ceremonies
were and are.
This is flatly forbidden,
Rom. 14. 3, 13.
            Secondly, that thy suspitions
transport thee
not to condemne thy
brother for hidden
things, the things of
darknesse and counsels
of the heart: till thou
be sure of the fault, or
offence, thou maist not
iudge, or censure, 2. Cor.
4. 5.
            Ninthly, if there be any
occasion of grieuance that
loue may be renewed, or
preserued, looke to two
things:
            
               First,9. Euil words and complaining. that thou render
not reuiling for reuiling,
1. Pet. 3. 9.
            Secondly, that thou
grudge not against thy
brother, or by whispering
depraue his actions,
or backbiting, or
complaine against him
to his disgrace in
things, where the right
is not apparantly discouered,
Iam. 5. 9.
            Lastly,10. Forsake not their assembly. if thou wouldest
preserue thy selfe in the
loue of the godly, then
thou must take heede of
forsaking the assembling together
of the Saints: Thou
must preserue all vvayes

of exercising the Communion
of Saints, and
hold fellowship with them
in Gods House, and in
your owne dwelling. Prophanenesse
must not draw
thee from the Temple,
nor worldlinesse from societie,
and louing, and
profitable conuersation
with thy godly friends and
acquaintance, Heb. 10. 25.
         
         
            CHAP. XXVIII.
            How wee must carrie our
selues towards such as are
fallen.
            HItherto of such rules
of conuersation, as

direct vs in our carriage
toward the godly considered
in generall. Now
there are other rules, which
concerne onely some of
the godly: Namely:

                  1. Such as are fallen.
                  2. Such as are weake.
                  3. Such as are strong.
                  4. Such as are especially
knit vnto vs in friendship.
               
            
            For the first, those that
are fallen, are either fallen
from God, or fallen from
thee. Such as are fallen
from God, are either fallen
grosely, and of habite, or
by infirmitie, and suddenly.
            
            
               Those, that are fallen
grosely, are either guiltie
of foule vices, or else of
extreme omissions, such as
that, which the Apostle
instanceth in of Idlenesse,
and the generall neglect
of their callings.
            Now towards both these
thou must bee thus ordered:How we must carry our selues towards such as are fallen fro God.
            
            First, warne them in the
beginning, and reproue
them sharpely, 1. Thes.
5. 14.
            Secondly, if they mend
not, auoide them, withdraw
thy selfe frō them,
conuerse not familiarly
with them, let them

not be the companions
of thy life, 1. Cor. 5. 11.
2. Thes. 3. 6, 14.
            Thirdly, if they repent,
forgiue them, and comfort-them,
lest they be
swallowed vp of griefe,
2. Cor. 7. 2, 8.
            Now if they bee fallen
by infirmitie, either they
are likely to offend again,
or not. If they bee likely
to fall further, saue them
with feare, pulling them
out of the fire, Iude 23. but
if not, then restore such a
one with the spirit of meekenesse,
comfort him, deale
gently with him, Gal. 6. 1.
            This of thy carriage to

such as are fallen from
God.
            As for those,How we must carry our selues towards such as trespasse against vs. that are
fallen from thee, by trespassing
against thee, thou
must obserue these rules
of carriage towards them.
            First, in slighter wrongs
doe all things vvithout
reasonings, or murmurings:
either speake not
of it, or so, as thou shew
no repining, or vexation
about it, Phil. 2. 14.
Secondly, in great
wrongs, thou must doe
two things:
            First, obserue the methode
of our Sauiour
Christ: when the trespasse

is secret, goe and tell him
of it betweene thee and him:
If he mend not, then take
two or three other discreet
godly persons with thee,
and tell him of it againe:
if hee yet mend not, then
diuulge it, and acquaint
the Church with it: Either
seeke a publike sentence
vpon him from authoritie,
or acquaint the
godly generally with it:
and if these courses will
not amend him, then abandon
his societie, as
if hee vvere a Heathen,
or a Publican, Mathew
18. 15.
            Secondly, if by any of

these courses hee repent,
forgiue him, yea, and that
as often as hee saith, it
repenteth him, if he should
doe thee many iniuries,
Luke 17. 3, 4.
         
         
            CHAP. XXIX.
            How we must carry our selues:
towards the weake Christian,
&c.
            THus of thy carriage
toward them that are
fallen.
            Towards weake Christians
we must bee thus ordered:How we must carry our selues towards weake Christians
            
            First, we must take heed,

that wee intangle them not
with, doubtfull disputations
in matters of ceremonies,
or things indifferent, Rom.
14. 1.
            Secondly, we must get
the skill to beare with their
weakenesses, & meere fraileties,
Rom. 15. 1.
            Thirdly, wee must be
wonderfull carefull, that
wee doe not offend them, or
cast any stumbling blockes
in their way, Math. 18.
1. Cor. 10. 32.
            Fourthly, wee must incourage
them, and comfort
them, and support them all
we can, 1. Thes. 5. 14.
            Fiftly, in things indifferent,
               
wee must not thinke
it much to crosse our selues
to please them, and to suffer
a little bondage in the restraint
of our liberty, rather
then vexe them; especially
for the furtherance of their
soules in the meanes of
their saluation, wee should
become all things to all men,
Gal. 5. 13. 1. Cor. 9. 20, 21, 22.
            3. Towards strong Christians
wee must be thus ordered:How we must carry our selues towards the strong.
            
            1. First, we must acknowledge
such, 1. Cor. 16. 18.
            2. We should set them
and their practice before
vs, as paterns, & examples of
imitation, 1. Cor. 5. 17. Phil. 3.
17.
            
               3. Wee should submit
our selues to such, to let them
aduise vs, & admonish vs,
and with all should submit
our iudgements in things
doubtfull to theirs, 1. Cor.
16. 16. 1. Pet. 5. 5.
            4. Towards thy friend
thou must be thus ordered.How we must carry our selues towards our special friend.
            
            1. Neuer forsake him,
Prou. 27. 10.
            2. Giue him hearty counsell,
Prou. 27. 9.
            3. Bee friendly to him,
Prou. 28. vlt.
            4. Communicate thy secrets
to him, Iohn 15. 15.
            5. Loue him with a speciall
loue.
            1. As thine owne soule,

Deut. 13. 6.
            2. Let thy loue be at all
times, euen in aduersitie,
Prou. 17. 17.
            3. It must bee a sincere
loue, that looketh not for
gifts, or rewards, Pro. 19. 6.
            4. It must be such a loue,
as will reach to his posteritie
also, if need be, 2. Chro. 20. 7
         
         
            CHAP. XXX.
            Rules that concern our selues:
and so first in our generall
calling.
            HItherto of the rules of
order in respect of
God, or our neighbours.

Now follow the rules that
concerne our selues:
            And these are of two
sorts. For they are either
such, as order vs at al times,
or such as order vs in the
times of affliction.
            
            The first sort concerne
either our generall, or particular
calling.
            
            The rules that concerne
our generall calling,How we must carry our selues in our generall calling. as in
this place they are to bee
considered of, concern either:
1. our Faith: 2. or
our repentance: 3. or our
hope.
            1. The rules,1. In matters of faith. that concerne
our Faith (supposing
the Christian to be informed

in the things contained
in the former Treatises)
are onely these two:
            First, thou must be expert
in the Catalogue of promises,
that concerne infirmities,
mentioned in the third
Treatise. For those wil preserue
thy faith in Gods fauour,
against the daily experience
of frailetie, and
infirmitie in thy selfe. For
thou maist by them see,
that thou hast no reason to
doubt of the continuance
of Gods loue to thee only,
because of thy many weaknesses.
For in those promises,
hee hath and doth
declare, how graciously he

is inclined to his seruants,
and passeth by their frailty,
and accepteth their desires
and endeuours, &c.
This rule will prooue a
maine support of the contentment
of thy life: and
therefore let not Sathan
make thee either despise,
or neglect it.
            Secondly, thou shalt
doe well to establish thy
iudgement particularly in
the doctrine of the principles
expressed in the fifth
Treatise; and by sound
learning of them settle
thy selfe, so as thou bee
no more carried about with
the winde of any contrary

doctrine: It should be the
labour & care of all good
Christians to keep the pattern
of wholesome words,
2. Tim. 3. 13.
            Concerning thy repentance,2. About thy repentance. as now it is to bee
vrged vpon thee; after thy
assurance one rule is of
singular vse, and that concernes
the Catalogue of present
sinnes: By the directions
in the first Treatise,
I suppose thou hast deliuered
thy selfe from the body
of sinnes, so as the most
of those euils mentioned
in thy first and great Catalogue,
are shaken off, neuer
to bee committed againe,

and so thou hast no
more to doe about them,
but giue God thankes for
thy deliuerance from them
through Iesus Christ: Now
because after thy first repentance,
there will remaine
some corruptions,
which as yet are not rooted
out; thy course for thy
whole life, for these remainders
of sinne, would
be this: Make thee a Catalogue
of thy present
sinnes, euen of such euils
as thou findest thy selfe
yet daily prone vnto. Examine
thy selfe seriously to
this end: it may bee thou
wilt finde 6. or 8. or 10. or

more, or fewer euils, which
yet hang vpon thy nature
and life: Thy course for the
vse of this Catalogue may
be this: I suppose thou art
instructed so far, as to know
the profite of daily calling
vpon God: Now whereas
inprayer thou dost; or
oughtst to make confession
of thy sinnes, in stead
of a more generall confession,
vse still thy Catalogue,
that is, labour euery
day to iudge thy selfe distinctly
for those sins that
doe presently annoy thee:
Hold on this course constantly;
till thou haue gotten
power against all, or

any of them, and as thou
findest vertue against any
of them, so alter thy Catalogue,
giuing thankes
for the sinnes thou gettest
head against, and putting
them out of thy Catalogue.
The paines is little,
it is once done for a
long time, and thy memory
will easily carry thy speciall
present faults: Besides,
this distinct daily remembrance
of thy present
sins, will make thee more
watchful against those sins;
& thou maist once a year,
or once a quarter, or before
euery Communion,
examine thy selfe anew,

and mend thy Catalogue,
by putting in any corruption,
which thou discouerest
then, or at any time,
to arise anew in thee, and
putting out such euils, as
by prayer thou hast gotten
victory against: Thus maist
thou see the state of thy
soule distinctly al the daies
of thy life, discerning when
thou goest forward or
backward: Besides, this
course of daily iudging
thy selfe, keeps thee out of
the danger of any wrath
from God.
            Concerning thy hope,3. About thy hope.
there are foure things for
thee to doe.
            
               First, pray constantly
and earnestly, for the knowledge
of the great glory is
prouided for thee: Thou
must forme the admiration
of heauen in thee, by
prayer: for naturally it is
not in vs, Ephes. 1. 18, &c.
            
            Secondly, thou must
vse all diligence to perfect
thy assurance of heauen,
when thou diest, Heb. 6. 12.
1. Pet. 1. 13.
            Thirdly, thou must striue
to accustome thy thoughts
to the daily contemplation
of heauen, that thy conuersation
may be in heauen, Phil.
3. 20,
            Fourthly, thou must

striue to direct thy heart,
and inable thy selfe to the
expectation of the comming
of Iesus Christ; thou must
labor for that skill distinctly,
to be able to waite for
the comming of Iesus Christ,
and to shew that thou louest
his appearing, 1. Thes.
1. 10. & 2. Thess. 3. 5. Gal. 5. 5
2. Tim. 4. 8.
         
         
            CHAP. XXXI.
            Rules that order vs in our
particular Calling.
            THus of the Rules that
concerne thy General
Calling:7. Things to be auoided in our particular Calling. in thy Particular
Calling there are seuen

things to be auoided.
            The first is slothfulnesse,
and thou art guiltie of this
sinne, both when thou dost
not the labours of thy calling,
and when thou obseruest
not the seasons, and
opportunities of thy Calling,
Prou. 10. 4, 5. And that
thou maist bee free from
this sin, thou must auoide
together with it the occasions
of it: And so thou must
auoide 1. The loue of sleep,
Pro. 20. 13. 2. Good fellowship,
& haunting of Ale-houses,
and Tauernes, and
keeping company with dissolute
persons, Prou. 21. 17.
3. Wandring from thine

owne house, euen that vnnecessary
going from house to
house, though it bee not to
places of ill fame. Fourthly,
thou must take heed of
pertinacious entertainement
of doubts and obiections
about thy Calling,
thou shouldst bee afraid
of excuses for idlenesse,
especially to bee so
selfe willed, as to be glad
of any thing may seeme to
patronize thy slouthfulnes,
Prou. 20. 4. & 15. 19. & 26.
16. And therefore to conclude
this Rule, when
thou art about thy calling,
what thou dost, do with all thy
power, Eccles. 9. 10. and rest

not in words or pratling:
Hee is not diligent, that
brags much of what work
hee can or will do, but hee
that doth it indeed, Prou.
14. 23.
            The second sin to bee
auoided in thy particular
calling,2. Vnfaithfulnesse. is Vnfaithfulnesse,
Prou. 20. 6. and so thou
must take heed of breach of
thy promise in thy dealings
with men, Psal. 15. 6. and
also thou must take heed
of all deceitfull courses, all
waies of fraud and couzenage.
It is a hatefull thing
in men, when they are such
as cannot be trusted, either
because they make not

conscience of keeping
their words, or because
they will vse so much cunning
and deceit, and dissimulation,
& lying in their
dealings.
            The third sinne to bee
auoided,3. Rashnesse. is Praecipitation,
hastinesse, and vnaduised
rashnesse arising out of the
leuity of mens mindes, or
their wilfulnesse. Prouidence
and wise Diligence
is wonderfull requisite vnto
a right ordering of our
selues in our Callings, Pro.
21. 5.
            The fourth sinne to bee
auoided,4. Passion. is Passion or perturbation;
and that hath

in it both vncheerefulnesse
and vnquietnesse: vncheere.
fulnesse, when men are not
content with their Callings,
or Gifts, or Estates,
1. Cor. 7. 17. vnquietnesse,
when men are froward, &
carry themselues peeuishly,
or cholerickly with
those that are about them.
This sinne of frowardnesse
is vehemently censured &
condemned in Scripture,
Prou. 11. 29. Psal. 37. 8. Pro.
16. 32. & 19. 11. & 25. 28.
whereas God requires a
quiet, contented, and merry
heart, Pro. 17. 22. Eccles.
9. 7, 8.
            The fift thing to bee auoided

and shunned,5. The temptations of thy calling. is the
Temptations of thy Calling;
euery Calling in the world
is assaulted with certaine
temptations, and they are
vsually of two sorts; For
first in all Callings there
are certain vnlawfull courses
held for gaine by wicked
men, which wee call
the sinnes of such a Calling.
These vniust courses thou
must learne to auoide, and
abhorre, and so exercise
thy Calling, as thou shun
those sinfull courses vsed
by wicked men in that
Calling: secondly, euery
Calling is assaulted with
crosses, & afflictions: Now

in these afflictions the deuill
is wont to tender ill
counsell, to perswade to
sinne, or the vse of vnlawfull
meanes, or other sins
of distrust in God: All
these thou must auoide.
            Sixtly,6. Worldlinesse. thou must take
heed of Worldlinesse, or setting
thy heart vpon these
earthly things thou art to
deale with in thy Calling:
Thou must euer be ready
to confesse, and shew it by
thy practice, that thou accountest
thy selfe to be but
a stranger and Pilgrime in
this world, Heb. 11. 13. and
if riches increase, thou must
look to it, that thou set

not thy heart vpon them,
Psal. 62. 10. Thou must vse
the world, but not loue the
world, 1. Ioh. 2. 15. Thou
maist and oughtest to bee
carefull to do the duties of
thy Calling; but thou must
in nothing be carefull about
the successe, but submit
thy selfe in all things to
God, Math. 6. 1. Cor. 7. 32.
Thou must behaue thy selfe
like a weaned child, Psal. 131.
1, 2. Take heed of eating too
much hony, Prou. 25. 16, 17.
& 27. 1, 2.
            The seuenth, and last
thing thou must auoid, is
prophanenesse,
               7. Prophanenes. which is to
vse the workes of thy Calling

without exercising
thy selfe in the Word of God,
and daily prayer for Gods
blessing vpon thy labours,
and the creatures thou art
to vse, Psal. 90. 1. Tim. 4. 3,
4. Gen. 24. 11, 12, 26, 27.
         
         
            CHAP. XXXII.
            How wee should carry our
selues in the time of affliction.
            THus of the Rules of
carriage which concerne
thy selfe at all times:
               How wee must carry our selues in affliction.
Now follow the Rules that
shew thee how to behaue
thy selfe in the time of affliction

and aduersity.
When thou art in affliction,
thou must consider
what thou must auoide,
and what thou must doe.
            Thou must auoide eight
things.8 Things to bee auoided. 1. Dissembling.
            
            First, Dissembling: Make
not thy selfe poore when thou
art rich; nor sick when thou
art well, Prou. 13. 7.
            Secondly,2. Shame. 
               Shame; Be not
ashamed of that condition
God brings thee into:
beare thy crosses with spirituall
magnanimity, account
not thy selfe dishonoured
by Gods hand,
who doth all for the best,
1. Pet. 4. 16.
            
               Thirdly,3. Impatience. 
               Impatience:
grieue not at Gods works:
sorrow not after the world:
Fret not at God or man;
Refuse not Gods chastening,
but with patience beare
what is laid vpon thee: It
is the Lord, let him do whatsoeuer
hee will with thee,
Prou. 3. 11.
            Fourthly,4. Discouragement. 
               Fainting, or
discouragement of heart:
Liue by faith; call not Gods
loue into question: keep thee
in the good way, Prou. 24. 10.
            Fifthly,5. Trust in carnall friends. 
               Trust vpon carnall
friends; Relye not vpon-man,
but vpon God:
Trust not in the arme of
flesh, Prou. 27. 10.
            
               Sixtly,6. Perplexed eares. Too much Carefulnesse
for the meanes
how to get out of affliction:
Commit thy way to God,
and put thy trust in him; vse
all lawfull meanes, but distresse
not thy heart with
bootlesse cares: Cast thy
care vpon God, for hee careth
for thee, phil. 4. 6. Iam. 4. 10.
            Seuenthly, Suddaine
feares;
               7. Suddain feares. Bee not so amazed
with the first tydings, or
beginnings of any affliction,
discouer not such want
of faith, as to be guilty of
those violent passions of
feare; Gods loue is vnchangeable:
and though
heauen and earth should

go together, yet God will
be with thee; Hee will not
leaue thee, nor forsake thee,
Prou. 3. 25.
            Eightly & lastly,8. Carelesnesse of thy waies. 
               Carelesnesse
of thy waies; be not
secure in sinning, but let
thy crosses melt off some
of thy drosse, & draw thee
neere to God: Go not on
boldly to sinne without regard;
if the Lord haue any
quarrell against thee, humble
thy selfe and depart from
iniquity, Prou. 14. 16.
            The things then thou
must doe on the contrary
side,5. Things to be done in the time of affliction. are these: When thou
art in affliction, thou must
do these things:
            
               First, thou must pray, and
call vpon the name of the
Lord; as these expresse
Scriptures require, Iam. 5.
13. Psal. 50. 15. 1. Cor. 4.
12, 13.
            
               Secondly, thou must
beare thy crosse with patience,
and contentation, Iam.
1. 4. 1. Pet. 3. 15. Esay 5. Phil.
4. 6. 2. Cor. 6. 8. Prou. 12. 9.
            Thirdly, thou must labour
for wisedome to know
how to carry thy selfe discreetly,
and to vse all good
meanes for thy deliuerance,
Iam. 1. 5.
            Fourthly, thou must bee
sure to shew thy trust in
God, and cast thy burthen

on the Lord, Iam. 5. 7, 8. Nahum.
1. 7. Psal. 27. vlt. & 37.
7. & 55. 22.
            Fifthly, thou must shew
thy obedience to God;
and that thou dost,
            1. If thou submit thy
selfe to Gods will, Heb. 5. 8.
            2. If thou iudge thy self, &
acknowledge thy sinnes to
God, Hosh. 5. vlt. Iob 36. 8.
            3. If thou be constant in
the good waies of godlinesse,
Psal. 37. 34.
            4. If thou learne more
righteousnesse, & art made
by thy crosses to do holy
duties with better affections,
Esay 26. 11.
            FINIS.
