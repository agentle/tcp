            TO THE READER.
            NO cankring Envy, Malice, nor Despite,
            Stirr'd vp these men so eagerly to flyte,
            But generous Emulation; so in Playes
            Best Actors flyte and raile, and thousand wayes
            Delight the itching Eare; So wanton Curres
            Wak'd with the gingling of a Courteours spurres
            Barke all the Night, and neuer seeke to bite
            Such brauery these Versers mou'd to write,
            Would all that now doe flyte would flyte like Those
            And lawes were made that none durst flyte in Prose
            How calme were then the World? perhaps this law
            Might make some madding Wiues to stand in aw,
            And not in filthy Prose out-roare their Men
            But read these Roundelayes to them till then.

            Heere it not stands by reason but by ryme;
            
               Anger t'asswage make Melancholy lesse,
            This flyting first was wrote, now tholes the Presse.
            Who will not rest content with this Epistle
            Let them sit downe and flyte, or stand and whistle.

               Lick butter, throat cutter, fish gutter, fill the fetter,
               Come bleitand and greitand, fast eitand thy laidly letter.
               FINIS.
