               And how in fight be often did preuaile.
               When three to one on ſeaes did him aſſaile.
               Seeking by force his ruine to haue wrought:
               Which he ſurpraiſed and them to england brought.

Thus for three houres they continued a ſore fight, the Captaine being

                there ordinanc otherwiſe ſhould haue done them moſt harme, yet of ſuch height was this foule cart from the Caruill ſides, that their taleſt man migh hardly reach their channell holes, ſo that there was no entering but with great danger, and therefore for ſafegarde of their men, the Captaine gaue ouer the fight, and not of feare for his men were reſolute, and doubted not the good ſucceſſe, and happie conqueſt of their enemies.
            Thus neere ſix a clock in the euening the caruill parting, the fight bareing rome from them, whoſe conſart was now come vp with them, continuing his courſe towardes the Ilandes, with faire and good weather where they had many chaces, which becauſe their actions were little worth to rehearſe, I omit to tell you of the bleſsing of the Almighty, on this worthy deſeruing Captaine, whoſe godly mind and good dealinges with all men the Lord doth reward. Sailing ſtil towards the Ilandes the ſeuenth day after they loſt the ſight of our owne land, (ſilly) they eſpied in the height of fortie two leager, two ſailes the one of them, being of burthen an hundreth and twenty tuns or there abouts, hauing in her of men forty ſix, furniſhed with ten caſt Peeces, the other of ſome three ſcore tunne or there abouts, with ſixteene men in her, well ſir after the captaine had hailed them, and bad thē ſtrike, they bearing Spaniards proud mindes, ſeeing ſo ſmale a Caruill as this our Ladie of the Captaines, ſcorned to yeeld, but made reddie to fight, and both began with all their force to aſſaile him moſt hotly, the gunner, from the great ſhip, ſhot the Caruilles meane miſsen from the yardes ſhered many ropes and did them great miſcheefe, ſo that with ſplycing and repairing, the ſame company was greatly puſſeled, in this time the Captaine calling for a canne of Wine and drinking hartely to them, deſired them all as they loued him to follow him, and at the next comming vp they would boord her where to they were al very willing, and comming vp with them againe, the Gunner with his broken mouth Minion, racked him fore and oft, the barre entring at the ſtarre went thoroughout: then comming vp in her quarter, the Captaine leapt in at their cheane holes, and one other with him who was

                place, when the ſhippes faling off, he had no remedy, but abide that chance God had alotted them, the company aboord loth to let their Captaine reſt in ſo great dāger came aboord againe, when valiantly they entered, his boy being with the firſt aboord had taken downe their Flag, to the great greefe of the enemie, who now repenting their hardineſſe craued mercie, the other ſmale Shippe ſeeing all the men of VVarre almoſt aboord, their Priſe layed the Caruell aboord, but to their great coſt. For there beeing courageous men, entered but ſix of them with their ſwordes and dagers, ſwordes and targates and ſuch as they had, and ſtowed the fifteene Portingauls ſo that they were poſſeſſed of both ſooner then they exſpected, the Captaine ſeeing the other was taken gaue God thankes for his goodnes, then demanded the Captaine of whence they were, they anſwered (of Viana in Portugale, and came from Parmabucca) loden with fine white Sugars, and dyuers Negros, when the companie had made through ſarch for pillage, the Captaine determined to bare for England, which his company willingly agreed vnto, praiſing him that giueth all victories for their good ſucceſſe, firſt in deliuering them without perill from the flie-bootes; next for their priſes, who was able being furniſhed with Engliſh-men, to haue beaten foure ſuch Caruiles, with ten peeces and fortie and ſix men, the other ſixteene men beſides Negros, the Caruill in all had but thirtie ſeuen men one caſt peece, wherefore hauing named their priſes, they had men fewe inough to carry home the Caruil, which compelled thē to leaue one other Caruil loden with Sugar behind them, a good pleaſure to the poore Portugalles, which loked with their neighbours to goe for England, thus in fiue weekes retorned the Captaine to Clauelly from whence they went & ſooner might if God had fauored them with faire windes. At the ſame port the ſaid Captaine diſcharged his goods royally paied each man of his company with the moſt, ſo that as well the peſant as the beſt had no cauſe to complaine, the Portugalls his priſoners he kept a ſhore at boord wages, ſo long as they remained with him, and after his buſines ended,

cauſing the good Ieſus his ſmale priſe to be rigged and vitled for three monethes, he gaue her the priſoners to bring them home with their Negroos and mony largly, by which his bountie and charitie to theſe poore men no doubt he gaineth as well loue of God, as fauour and the louing kind hartes of men. Thus farre with fauour I beſeech you exſcept my ſimple writing and ioy with mee as I know you doo for your freind whom God by his grace hath ſufficiently bleſſed with welth, as heere tofore I certified you, his owne ſhip was the grace of God, who took our Lady and ſaint Anthonie, our Lady ſhe made a man of warre, who hath taken now thoſe two priſes loaden with ſuger the one called ſaint Fraunces, the other the good Ieſus, both of Viana, a wonder of the Lorde, to appoint this Spaniſh ſaints to make rich his engliſh ſailours, as by this valiant Captaine is ſhewed, for how many Captaines hath had ſuch bleſſinges as this gentlemā, or who more fortunate, whom Ieſus our Lady S. Fraunces & S. Anthony, hath brought their bleſſinges there news, ther is none worthy to write, but for your hawkes, I hope by ſaint Iames tide to bring you, till then with my heartieſt commendationes, I leaue you to his protection whom I daily pray to bleſſe vs all from Barnſtable in the north of Deuonſhire this 6 of Iuly 1592.
