            Deliuered in a moſt Familier Dialogue, betweene Reaſon and Religion, touching Pradeſtination, Gods word, and Mans Free-will, to the vnderſtanding of the weakeſt Capacitie, and the confirming of the more ſtrong.

            The Epiſtle to the Reader.
            
               THis Diuine worke (gentle Reader) though the Author left vnprinted, yet comming to his hands that wiſht a continuance to the memory of the famous Writer, and a comfort to the ſoule of the deſirous Reader, hee thought good to bring it to the preſſe: and the rather ſeeing that the points herein handled (beeing in them-ſelues very difficult, and heretofore

not ſo plainly expreſſed) are here laid down that the meaner capacity may be inſtructed, & the ſkilfuller more confirmed. Heere thou maiſt ſee Reaſon contending with Religion, and Religion reſoluing thoſe doubts which to Reaſon ſeeme diſſoluable. Here thou ſhalt know, though Reaſon tel thee, if God haue praedeſtinated his elect, yet, Religion will tel thee, except thou worke out thy ſaluation with feare and trembling, thou art none of Gods fore-choſen: If from hence Reaſon ſay vnto thee thou haſt abſolute free-will, yet Religion will tell thee that thy willing comes from God. In a word; heere Ignorance ſhall be taught by Truth, and Atheiſme confuted by Religion. Then (courteous Reader) peruſe this worthie Worke (of the eminent Preacher Maiſter ARTHVR DENT) wherein thou ſhalt finde the ready Pathway to eternall life;

through which if thou wilt ſoiourne, at the end thereof thou ſhalt finde Heauen-gates ſet wide open to receaue thee, and troopes of Angels ready to carry thee into Abraham his boſom, where thou ſhalt reſt from thy labor, and haue all teares wiped from thy eyes.

That the Church of God, was drowned in the generall ouerflowing, when al the world was drown'd, and the church of ſatan ſaued in the Arke. That the church of God periſhed-among the Sodomites, and iuſt Lot, and his family, were y• church of the diuel: y• the Iewes, Scribes, & Phariſees, were the Church of

Chriſt, and Chriſt him-ſelfe with the remnant of beléeuers the Church of Antichriſt: In concluſion that theyr Church is now the true Church becauſe of the multitude, and ours the falſe: we wil demand but one thing of thoſe multitude of men, which if they truly tell vs and proue, they ſhall haue our hand and▪ our heart, wée will become as true to them as ſtéele, and conſent to any religion of theyr forefathers; which is, that they ſhew forth, at what time the eſtate of the world, was in ſo good caſe, that the beſt thinges did pleaſe the greateſt number, or when iniquity had not the moſt conſent of adherents (except at that time, when all were drown'd except eight perſons) Alaſſe theyr proofe is euen as farre to ſéeke, as heauen is diſtant from hell; God graunt therefore the condition ofRom. 10. 16 conſent, be no nearer vnto vs. For it is written broad is the way, that leadethMath. 7. 14. to perdition, and many walk therein, but narrow is the path to ſaluation,Rom. 9. 27. ſtraight is the gate. and few do enter therat. And further, though the childrē of Iſrael were as y• ſand of the ſea, yet ſhall but a remnant be ſaued; This is yet

more plainly verified by Elias the Prophet who ſaw not one man frée from Idolatry, and the ſubiection of Belial,
               Rom 11. 13 beſides himſelfe, in all the world, yet did he willingly (all regard of the multitude laid apart,) ſerue the Lord of heauen truly.

And with Iudith, we will not follow the ſinnes of our fore-fathers which forſake their God, and worſhipped ſtrange gods.
            
            The holy Hrophet receaued from the2 Tim. 3. 16, mouth or ſecret inſpiration of God all that doctrine y• they deliuered or taught: the Apoſtles proued their Doctrine out of Prophets: the godly of enſuing ages haue reſted vppon them; And ſhall wee alone be careleſſe, or accompt it ynough, if many men haue gon before vs, contrary to the Prophets and Apoſtles? No, no, Al men haue ſinned from the firſt (except

one) and ſhall doe to the laſt, yet it is nothing lawfull for vs to follow their ſteps therein: Therefore although our forefathers were Idolaters, yet muſt wee learne to ſerue the Lord, And that wee may the better performe our duties in that behalfe, it behoueth vs to be wiſe in the trying of ſpirits, leaſt we become clyents to our forefathers ſuperſtitions, or ſuperſtitious in our owne fancies, & ſo ignorantly neglect the precepts of our God.
            Let vs therfore looke vpon the iniunctions of Popery, that we may be able to reprehend the Church of Rome, but let vs call home theyr generall Councels, with the rabble of theyr decretals to the ſame Prophets and Apoſtles, And woe ſhal anon perceiue that we haue no cauſe to feare (theyr times out of mind) knowing that an euil cuſtom is no better then a commō peſtilence, which by how much the more is old and ancient, by ſo much the more it is rotten & ſtinking: nor yet their commō conſents, ſéeing the ſtate of gods childrē is oftētimes to be deſolate. And becauſe there is no hereſie but will challenge ſom maintenance out of Gods

word, ſaying that theyr Church is the Church Apoſtolicall, which the Papiſt as boldly ſweareth & taketh vpon him, as if nothing were good but his Maſſe, let them ſhew vs the Prophets and Apoſtles for their Maſſes, Dirges, Trentals, praying to Saints, praying with brads, praying to help ſoules out of purgatory, worſhipping of Idols, Biſhopping of baptized children, kiſſing of Pares, Créeping to Croſſes, baptizing of bells, coniuring of water, coniuring of balme, coniuring of hearbes, buying of bulles and pardons, and auricular confeſſion; & the reſt of their ſacraments, paying of vaine vowes, going on pilgrimage, pace-eggs, manyples, licking of rotten bones, Auc-Maryes bleſſing with two fingers, annoynting, annoyling, abſoluing, knéeling knocking, whipping, crouching, kiſſing, croſſing, ſhauing, greaſing, and ten thouſand ſuch trickets moe. I appeale to the iudgement of the wiſe-harted, whether God abrogating the ceremonies of his own law, did purpoſe, that the Pope ſhould inſtitute and erect a new, of ſuch traditions as theſe.
            If we hold them hard to the proofs

of theſe and ſuch other, by the touchſtone, aforeſaid (namely y• word of God) theyr next leape, is longer then the paſſage betwéene Douer and Callice: for they croſſe the broad ſs as to vnwritten verities. But how colde theyr entertainment is there, we would not much feare to make thē-ſelues the Iudges, if ſhame & grace had not forſaken them. In déed wee know and confeſſe that more was ſpoken, then is written: And that whatſoeuer Chriſt & the Apoſtles preached, was the word of GOD were it written or not: But we know alſo that if more had bene neceſſary to ſaluation then is written, God would not ſuffer vs to want it, leaſt with them we might happen to runne a whoring after our owne deuiſes: But aboue all, wee are moſt aſſured that the Spirit of God neuer was, nor will be contrary to it ſelfe: Therefore let vs try how truly theyr berities vnwritten doe accord with the written word.
            We finde in the Scripture, that wee ought to worſhip God alone, and not to make our ſelues any grauen Image; but is it poſſible that the Word vnwritten

ſhould tollerate their prayers to ſaints? theyr ſacrificing to Idols, and theyr falling downe before blocks? In his word written, it is called the Doctrine of dinels to forbid matrimony to any man, and can it bee his word vnwritten that Miniſters ſhall neuer marry? it is his word written that all that depart this world in the Lord, do reſt from theyr labours: and is it alſo in the word vnwritten that they bee purged of many torments in the fire of Purgatory before they do reſt: it is playne by the word written, that wee haue no remiſſion of ſinne but in the blood of Chriſt, without whome we are dead and condemned to the bottome of hell: but is it as playne by his word vnwritten, that the Pope can ſaue? that who-ſoeuer ſhal die in a white fryers ſcapulary, ſhal be ſaued? or he that dyeth in a gray fryars frocke, ſhall neyther come in Purgatory, nor in hell? and aboue all is it his word vnwritten, that a man may get in ſ

So that charity béeing the vnderſeruant to religion, and a ſecond thing required, they make it the head-ſtone of the corner, and the foundation wher-vpon they build all theyr righteouſneſſe vnto ſaluation: Truly we dare not deny that in reſpect of the world (wereit not depraued) the Papiſt haſh ſom good matter in him, becauſe his déeds doe often times extend to the benefit of GODS Church: And euen in this (I write in the gréef of my conſcience wherin I call the Lord to witneſſe) ſhall they

O blindneſſe, that ſeeth not theſe euills, nay twiſe O blindneſſe that doth not ſée, more then this! what is it to ſay that we are able to ſaue & iuſtifie our ſelues before the tribunall ſeat of God, but to reproue our moſt wiſe God of folly & doltiſhneſſe, in that without need, hee ſent Jeſus Chriſt his welbeloued Son, by ſo great torment, as he indured to deliuer vs from the bondage

of ſinne? And what is it elſe but to contemne the vnſpeakable loue of our ſauior, who being a God ſo mighty, y• King of all Kings, and the only Prince of all worlds, diſdayned not to take vnto him, the contemptible ſhape of a ſeruant, and to beare the burden or all our ſins, euen vnto the death of the vile and ſhamefull croſſe, that hee might preſent vs blameleſſe before his father. Which groſſe opinion ſo outragiouſly blaſphemous, ſome Papiſts at this 
                  •
               ay waxing halfe aſhamed of, and daring not ſo broadly to maintaine, will ſeeme to qualifie with a poore ſhift of deſkant. And becauſe very infants or fooles in this light of the goſpell (for which the Lord be prayſed) might otherwiſe point at them for their folly, they ar contct not to be priue Chriſt of his dignity altogether, and therefore doe attribute ſome part of iuſt fication to him, & the reſt to them-ſelues. Surely this is ſcarcely ſo good a recompence, as hauing cracked his crown, to giue him a plaſter: for except ſom inſufficiency were or might iuſtly be foūd in him, what madnes ſhould moue them to intrude themſelues into his office? But if theſe enter

commoners with Chriſt, though they ſéeme to haue retayned a certaine blinde modeſty be heedfully examined, in truth they doe but practiſe to delude themſelues and vs, hauing no mind to deale with Chriſt whot or cold.
            For if we demaund of them for Gods eternall predeſtination, whereby he bringeth the elected and reprobate ſort to the
                  •
               r appointed ends, they are at defiance with that doctrine: and euen in this haue they taken away all that part of iuſtification, that they aſcribed to Chriſt before, for why? If we be not ſafe conducted to heauen by the predeſtinate on of God in Jeſus Chriſt, if followeth that we are carryed thether by ſame deſert of our owne, or elſe that wee neuer come there at all, it were a ſtrong engine that ſhould hale them from this opinion, and yet is Chriſt heereby made altogether Jacke out of office. Let vs not wonder at theſe men, ſo much as pray for them: let vs not quarrel ſo much with them, as perſwade with them, nor laugh ſo muck at theyr folly & wickednes as lament theyr ignorance: for this is true, if they be right, we be wrong, if we

be wrong, we are already ſold vnder ſin: contrary wiſe if we be right (whereof let vs not doubt, becauſe the ſpirit of truth hath ſealed vs vppe in the Prophets and Apoſtles) then are they wrong: if they be wrong, there is nothing more certayne then theyr iuſt damnation, vnleſſe they turne to God with hearty repentance (which God for his ſon ſake euen ſpéedily grant them) if it be his will.
            And although they are not aſhamed to denounce againſt vs, that we are Libertines and deſpiſers of good works, becauſe we preferre our fayth in free iuſtification: be it as farre from vs to be troubled at thoſe falſe ſuggeſtions, as we are frée of that fault, we know & confeſſe, that Gods deareſt children, haue ſmal féeling of God without righteous doing: therefore wee profeſſe that if wee ſée no good workes in our hands, if we perceiue not that the preaching of the Goſpell hath mortified in our concupiſcence, and made vs to hunger & thirſt after righteouſnes, we haue ſmal teſtimony of Gods election, we may talk til we are weary of our hope and faith in Chriſt, we may prattle till we ar hoarſe of the Goſpell and our

profeſſion, and we may deſie the Pope and his accomplices to the bottome of hell. But except our ſelues loue the righteouſneſſe of God, and we exerciſe the ſame, Satan doth féed vs forth, with the ſtrength of illuſion: for Godlineſſe is not made of talke as bookes are of leaues nor as woods are of trées, but it is ſuch a holineſſe as doth clime, from vice to vertue, and from one vertue to another without ceaſing.
            Good ſir, this being true, we haue néed to looke about vs, and euery man haue an eſpeciall eye to Gods glory in the execution of our actions: and if we haue attained to ſome knowledge in the ſchoole of Chriſt; we ſée in the Goſpell, that he is condemned, that hideth his talent, aſwel as the other, that riotouſly waſted it, I pray you apply this to your ſelfe whom the Lord hath loued with long continewaunce of his goodneſſe, and you ſhall find out a right Chriſtian exploit euen in the man, that ſat next at your elbow. Set vpon it, or if you haue begon giue it not ouer, for the winning of one ſoule to Chriſt is more acceptable in the ſight of GOD, then to offer the whole world for a ſacrifice;

what though he be a man, the ſpirit of GOD is able to encounter him, if hee bee neuer ſo wyly or peruerſe in opinion. God who is able to rend the heart, and to pierce the marrow in the bones, is alwayes preſont in his owne worke.
            What though hee happily may commaund your ſilence, your ſpirit muſt bee touched with his ſinnes, you may not ſuffer him to reſt in vncleanneſſe: for they that are of CHRIST are alwayes carefull to bring others to Chriſt-ward, but eſpecially thoſe that are ſo neare vnto them, as hee is to you, you know that in proceſſe of time, the ſoft drop of raine doth break the hard flint, the ſilly worme doth throw downe the mighty oake, and the ſlow ſnayle doth attayne to the top of Mountaines. Therefore let nothing diſcon age you.
            If this opinion be eſtabliſhed vpon the preſcriptions of his forefathers, try him by the Prophets & Apoſtles, if the length and continuance of his religion doth ſéeme forceable toperſwade him. ſhew him the law, where God puniſhed y•
               
tranſgreſſion of Iſrael with four hundred yeares blindneſſe; and no doubt hee that would puniſh the tranſgreſſion of that Law, the gaue by Angells, with ſo long ignorance, may as iuſtly perſwade him, that the ſame God can puniſh the contempt of his Goſpel, with a thouſand yeares blindneſſe; Nay proue vnto him (I ſay) the generall apoſtacy wherof the Apoſtles haue told vs, if he dare not ſubſcribe to the Goſpell, becauſe he may become an offence to his friendes, proue from thence, that he feareth his worldly friendes, more then hee loueth his heauenly God: if he ſhun the Goſpel becauſe of thoſe hereſtes, that dayly ſpring vp in the light therof, ſhew him that he neuer knew, or elſe hath forgotten the Scripture, which doth witneſſe: The Hereſies muſt needs be, that the faithful may1 Cor. 11. 19 be tryed, if his eies be preſixed vpon profeſſors, that he can find many faults in theyr manners, let him look backe into him-ſelf, and he ſhall ſée that Papiſts and Proteſtants are very men, néeding the Phiſition: But if he find not ſo great corruption in him-ſelfe; Firſt let him take1 Cor. 10. 12 héed leaſt it fare with him, as with men

But if there bee not indéed ſuch corruption in them (which is hard to be determined on eyther ſide, conſidering how partiall our nature is in it owne behalfe, and ready to ſla

maintaine theyr religion, nor any heretique that hath bene ſince the firſt beginning of Papiſtry. Therfore you may proue vnto him, that this fault ought not to be fathered on the word of God, which doth plainly and truly ſet forth all points of religion: But rather vpon Sathan and his mallice, whoſe continuall practiſe hath béene, by al meanes and deuices poſſible, to diſcredit the religion of God: for ſuch Darnell did hee throw among the Apoſtles, as did ſet great diſſention betwéene Paul and Barnabas, andActs. 13. 29 Gal. 2. 1
