Wonderfull and
ſtrange effect and vertues
of a new Terra Sigillata
lately found out in
Germanie,
            
            With the right order of
the applying and adminiſtring
of it: being oftentimes
tried and experienced by
Andreas Bertholdus of
Oſchatz in Miſnia.
               
            
            AT LONDON,
Printed by Robert Robinſon
for Richard Watkins.

            To the right worſhipfull,
my eſpeciall good
friendes M.D. Maiſter, and
M.D. Baylie, Doctors in
Phyſicke attendant vpon
her Maieſtie.
            
               WEL knowen
is it vnto you both,
Right reuerende and
learned doctors how
carefully our good
friende M. Hugh Morgan her Maieſties
Apothecarie, hath euermore
imployed himſelfe and his purſe to
furniſh this Realme with the rareſt,
perfecteſt and beſt ſortes of all maner
of Plants, Fruits, Iuyces, Gumes,
Mettals, Mynerals, Boales, Stoanes,
and whatſoeuer elſe needfull: For



the either preſeruing or reſtoring of
health. Whereby he hath not onely
well deſerued of his Countrie at
home. But is alſo become famous
for ſundrie his compounds, ſpecially
for his exact Compoſition of his
Mythridat, and his Tyracle of Andromachus:
throughout France and
Italie and manie places further off.
It pleaſed him (I thanke him) of late
to ſend vnto me a new Terra Sigillata,
latelie found out in Germanie:
which hath not onely beene tryed
by the Phiſitions of thoſe partes to
be moſt ſouereigne againſt all poyſons
and ſundrie deadlie diſeaſes:
but hath alſo in the like caſes been
here wel experienced by my good
& learned friend M. Doctor Hector,
Nunnes and diuerſe others of your
learned Colledge in London, who
hath found it moſt effectuall in ſundrie
dreadfull and daungerous diſeaſes.
He ſent me withall a little
booke in latine written by Andreas
Bertholdus touching the vertues



and the right vſe thereof, which I
thought good for the benefite of
ſuch as bee ignorant in that tongue
to put in engliſh and to publiſh it
vnder your learned protection.
Accept it I beſeech you and vouchſafe
it your fauorable countnance.
Aluingham this 14. of Auguſt.
1587.
            
               Your aſſured louing
friend,
B. G.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            Of the Vertues, force,
and vſe, of the right and approued
Terra Sigillata
of Germanie.
            
               FIrſt (which in nature
is moſt to bée wondered
at & reuerenced,)
it reſiſteth all maner
Poyſons or Venoms
receiued inwardly, be
they neuer ſo furious or deadly, and
ſpéedily expelleth them by vomit, if
either before or preſently after the
poyſons it be taken, if any thing later,
it driueth them out by ſweating.
            Secondly, with the like wonderfull
qualitie of nature, it reſiſteth the
moſt cruell and horrible infection of
the Peſtilence, not onely in preſeruing
ſuch as vſe it, but alſo in ſpéedie
curing and calling to life, ſuch as are
infected, and halfe dead.
            
               
Thirdly, it cureth the bitings or
ſtingings of all maner of venemous
beaſtes, or wormes, and any wounde
made with poyſoned Darte or weapon.
            Fourthly, it is founde to haue a
ſingular and moſt ſwéete agréement
and wonderfull Sympathy with the
vitall partes of mans bodie, ſo as it
greatly comforteth the heart, refreſheth
the brayne, and kéepeth away
diſeaſes from all the inward partes
beſides. It aſſwageth all manner of
headach, paine and trembling of the
heart. It helpeth wounded, inflamed,
bleared, and watring eyes. It
hath alſo béene found by experience,
that in wounds and inflamation of
the brayne and the ſtones, this excellent
earth hath done more good than
any other medicine could promiſe or
performe.
            Fiftly, againſt all vnmeaſurable
bléeding, either of veyne, Arterye, or
any other part of the bodie, there cannot
a more aſſured remedie be found.
            Sixtly, it dryeth vp all manner of



Rewmes, Deſtilations, and Murrs.
            Seuenthly, it ſtoppeth the Laſke,
Lyentery, bloudy flixe, and all other
too much looſeneſſe of the belly.
            Eightly, it throughly healeth all
burnings, or ſcaldings, by Fire, Water,
or Mettal, both keeping them
from bliſtring, and ſpéedily reſtoring
the hurt parts.
            Ninthly, it healeth ſoundly and
perfectly all gréene woundes, & rankled
and rotten Soares.
            Tenthly, it is againſt the Quinſey
and inward Inflamations a moſt
preſent remedie.
            The eleuenth, againſt Itch and
Skabs that are hardly cured, this
earth is with very good ſucceſſe vſed.
            The twelft, it is a moſt méete medicine
againſt all ſuch ſickeneſſes as
are to be auoided by Sweating.
            The thirtéenth, againſt the conſuming
of the Longs, as well in drying
vp the Soare, as in ſtaying the
ſpitting of bloude, it is a medicine
moſt profitable.
         
         
            
            A more full and playner
declaration, of the maner
and order in the vſing the
ſaid earth againſt the diſeaſes
before named.
            
               FIrſt, to ſpeake in generall
of the vſe of this
earth, and the manner of
taking it: It is with
moſt happie ſucceſſe giuen.
In the like ſorte, and againſt
the ſame vnnaturall diſeaſes, as is
the earth of Lemnos, which of olde
time was ſo famous, and is at this
day ſo highly of the Turkiſh Emperour
and his Baſſas accounted of, as
they eſtéeme it to be farre more precious
than golde: Nay which is
more, in the curing of many diſeaſes,
it farre excéedeth the ſaide Lemnian
earth, which for the moſt part counterfette,
is yet with ſuch difficultie
brought out of Turkie vnto vs (For
that which is commonly ſolde at the
Apothecaries, is in compariſon hereof
not worthy to bee named.) And



therefore great good reaſon it is, that
wee confeſſe, and with a thankefull
minde acknowledge, the ſingular liberalitie
and bountie of that great
and moſt mighty maieſtie extended
towards our countrymen of Germanie:
That where by reaſon of the
Turkiſh barbarouſneſſe ſo godly and
bleſſed giftes of God, as likewiſe all
learning, artes, and liberall ſciences,
hath béene defaced and corrupted,
yet hath it pleaſed him at this day, ſo
to bewtifie this poore Country of
Germanie, not onely with all kindes
of good learning and artes, and with
the profound knowledge of Diuinitie,
but hath likewiſe ſent vnto vs
ſuch his moſt rare & excellent gifts,
whereby we are ſufficiently prouided
of whatſoeuer concerneth the health
of either ſoule or bodie. And becauſe
I would not haue men be perſwaded
by my bare wordes (who vpon a charitable
affection haue willingly publiſhed
to the world this worthy benefite
of God,) I doe vnto all learned
men commit the efficacie, forme, and



vertuouſnes of this bleſſed and neuer
ſufficienly commended earth, to bée
wayed & examined with ſound iudgement
and conſideration, which hath
often béene prooued by good tryal and
experience. The vertues whereof for
their furtherance that haue not béene
much acquainted with Phiſicke, I
will here briefly ſet downe.
            Firſt, if poyſon be giuen to anie
man in meate or drinke or otherwiſe,
or if any haue vnawares, as manie
times it chaunceth, taſted any deadly
or venemous medicine, as ſoone as
hee perceiueth himſelfe diſeaſed, let
him take a dramme of this earth, or
more or leſſe according to ye ſtrength
of the poyſon, and the age and force
of the ſicke man, and in ſome conuenient
Lyquor let him drinke it vp,
and if the poyſon haue béene but newly
receiued, he ſhall preſently bring it
vp by vomit: But if ſo be through longer
time the Venom haue béeue diſperſed
and carryed to the inwarde
veynes yet being well couered in his
bedde, he ſhall happily driue it out by



ſweating. The Lyquors that are
moſt méeteſt to take it with, are theſe:
the water of Carduus benedictus,
Dyuils bitt, ſwallowwort.
            The water of the rootes of the
great brode Clott, Angellica, Pympernell,
aud ſuch like: If you haue
not theſe waters at hande, this ſouerayne
preſeruatiue may be taken verie
well in white Wine.
            Secondly, againſt the plague it
may be vſed in the like maner, eſpecially
when it is to be giuen vnto ſuch
as are alreadie infected. But if you
meane to take it but as a preſeruatiue,
you néede not to take a whole
dramme, for halfe a dramme taken in
the morning in a little wine or vineger
of Marygolds, or any other conuenient
Lyquor, will very well ſerue.
            I my ſelfe haue alwayes vſed this
earth with very good ſucceſſe, in maner
as followeth, as ſoone as a man
féeleth any paine of his heart or his
heade, or perceiueth any anguiſh,
grudging, lothſomneſſe, guiddineſſe,
or other ſignes of the peſtilence, I do



ſtreight diſolue in wine, water, or other
lyquor, a dramme of this earth,
and giue it to the ſicke man in his
bedde, caſting him in a ſweat, wherewith
the venome is in a very fewe
houres driuen out, without any outward
ſore or ſwelling: But if it ſo
fall out as it be not taken in time, the
bloud being for the greateſt parte infected,
there cōmeth out in the ſweating
either ſore or carbuncle. In this
caſe you muſt open the veyne as nere
to the ſore as may be: As if it be vnder
the arme,Or middle veine. open the Mediana of
the ſaide arme, if the botch bee in the
flanke or grayne, the great veyne on
the inſide of the legge is to be opened,
if the ſore be vnder the knée, open
the veyne in the ſoale of the foote.
In the meane time bee not negligent
in quallifying of euill humors, leaſt
the poyſon gathering force ſhoulde
ſtrike to the heart, the heart being relieued,
will forthwith driue the venom
into a ſore, which ſore being ripe,
muſt by an expert Surgeon out of
hand be launced and well healed vp,



neither muſt you omit to take a little
portion of this earth, and ſtéeping it
in vinager with pouder of Cynamon,
make it in a playſter, and lay it vpon
the heart, you ſhall perceiue a great
quantitie of the poyſon drawen out
by the playſter.
            Herewithall muſt you remember
after the receit of the medicine to take
a toſte wet in very good vinager, and
to cauſe the patient to holde it to his
noſe to kéepe him from caſting it vp
againe. And if he fortune to caſt it vp
you muſt giue it againe and againe,
till his ſtomacke doe kéepe it. This
manner of vſing of it a man of great
authority and calling in the Turkes
Court did ſend to a noble man his
friende as a great ſecret, with this
proteſtation, that a principall Phiſition
of the Turkes did leaue this order
written in the Arabyck tongue,
which the experiences of a great nū
               ber
hath ſince confirmed.
            Thirdly, againſt the biting of a
madde dogge, the ſtinging of Serpents,
Scorpions, Spyders, or any



other venemous wormes, as alſo againſt
woundes made by poyſoned
weapons, this earth may in this ſort
be moſt commodiouſly vſed. Take as
much thereof as ſhall ſuffice for the
bigneſſe of the wound, and with faſting
ſpittle make it into a paſte
ſpred vpon Linnen, and lay it to the
ſoare, or being made more thinner anoynt
the ſoare with it, whereby the
venome ſhall not all onely be drawen
backe, but the force thereof quite abated,
ſo as in this caſe it is not poſſible
to haue a better medicine. And if it
happen the plaſture bee applyed too
late, then muſt you of nereſſitie driue
out the poiſon by receiuing inwardly
a dram of the earth infuſed in wine
or other medicinable Lyquor.
            Fourthly, it doth wonderfully aſſwage
the paynes and raging of the
head, whether it come of heate, wind,
labour, watching, care, or trouble of
minde, and reſtoreth the conſumed
ſpirits if it be taken with good Aqua
vitae, the waters of Betony, Roſmary,
Mageram, Penyroyall, or ſuch



like, or in great heate a dramme of it
taken in the morning with Roſewater.
The paynes and trembling of the
heart it aſſwageth, and the heart it
ſelfe being dumpiſh it greatly reioyceth,
if a dramme of it be taken with
the waters of Balme, Salendine,
Mother-wort, Buglaſſe, Borage, or
Geliuer Flowers, or dronke in like
ſort with good white wine. For the
burning heat of the eyes, bleerednes,
rumes, or any flux, this earth is ſpecially
good, applyed eyther with Roſewater,
the waters of Planteyne, Eybright,
Valeryan, Fenell, or any ſuch,
and dropped into the eye with the fether
of a blacke henne, or linnen cloth
dipped in the water and layde to it,
for any ſtripe in the eye it healeth it,
if it be layd to with ye whit of an egge,
and any conuenient water as ſhall
ſéeme good to the Phiſition or Surgeon.
It helpeth the wounds of the head
or of the ſtones, if being diſolued in
Roſewater, a linnen cloth dipped
therein be layd to the hurt place, for
therby ſhall the ſoare be kept from any



inflamation, flux of euill humors,
or hurtfull accident.
            Fiftly, you may quickely ſtanch
bloud breaking out from any part of
the body, if you beate a Trocyſe of
this earth into pouder, & mingling
it with ſpittle or any other lyquor, apply
it to the place, you ſhall ſoone reſtreyne
bléeding at the noſe if mingling
this earth with vinager, ye white
of an egge, & the water of Tormentyll,
you ſpreade it vpon linnen cloth
and lay it to the temples to the parte
of the head, and put it into the noſe,
you ſhall eaſily alſo diſſolue cluttered
bloud congealed within the body by
any caſualty, if you take either this
earth alone in warme wine, or if you
cauſe the patient to drink a dramme
of the earth and a dramme of that
bole which they that digge in quarreyes
finde in the midſt of the ſtones,
and name it it in Dutch of the colour
Lyuerſtone, and of the place Steynmarle,
diſſolued in the white of two
egges and warme vinager, with a
ſcruple of Saffron.
            
               
Sixtly, to cure the Rewme, vſe often
to drinke this earth morning and
euening, eyther in white wine or other
lyquor, whereby you ſhall immediately
ſweate and finde great eaſe.
            Seuenthly, you ſhall ſtoppe any
looſeneſſe of the bodie if you giue a
dramme of this earth in the morning
and at night in the water of Tormentyll,
of Oke leaues, or of the
flowers of our Acacia.
            
            Eightly, to kéepe any parte of the
body that it blyſter not after burning
and ſkalding and to ſkinne it verie
ſpéedily, powre vpon this earth cléere
Fountaine water wherein vnquenched
Lime hath ſoaked the night before,
and herewithall with the fether
of a blacke henne anoynt often times
very tenderly the ſore place.
            Ninthly, if this earth be put in any
playſter ſtéeped in any lyquor, or
receiued any wayes into the body, it
perfectly cureth al paines, inflamations,
or euill accidents of any wounds
or vlcers, eſpecially woundes of the
kydneis, ſtones, or inward parts.
            
               
Tenthly, it healeth Itches, Scabs,
Rybes, Skuruineſſe, Mangies, or other
ſuch filthy diſeaſes of the ſkinne
and maketh the ſkinne ſmoth and
white, if ſo be it be diſſolued in ſpring
water or plantyne water, if the foule
and leprous ſkinne be often waſhed
therewith and not dryed after it.
            Laſtly, this earth of ours doth
helpe the quinſey, inward inflamations,
vlcered Lungs, and ſuch other
inward diſeaſes, if a dramme of it be
taken in any water proper to the diſeaſe,
and likewiſe it cureth all Collickes,
and Illyacke paſſions. Theſe
are in effect the vertues of this excellent
earth, as farre as I haue hitherto
had experience. Other vertues of
this bleſſed earth doubtleſſe there are
many, which I leaue to the experiences
of the learned Phiſitions. Onely
this I will tell them, that this earth
is of the nature of the Sunne, or of
Golde, for it groweth in no place
but in the golde mynes in the midſt
of the rockes, as doth the precious
ſtone. (I meane the yellow earth, for



the white is in the ſiluer mynes, and
likely it is that euery mettal elſe hath
his proper vole or earth as I geſſe,
for as yet I haue not fully vnderſtood
it.) Whereupon it is called by Paracelſus
in the firſt parte of his great
Surgery and in other places, the
greace of the Sunne, becauſe it hath
in it ſome ſhewe of fatneſſe. Moreouer,
I haue had of ſome ſkilfull Alchymiſts
two ſortes of earth, the one
drawen from golde, the other from
ſiluer very like vnto theſe of ours,
which ſo being, out of all doubt that
earth of ours being as it ought to be
prepared and applyed, will cure all
thoſe gréeuous diſeaſes that golde it
ſelfe being prepared according to Art
will cure, which I leaue to the ſearch
of the wiſe and learned Phiſitions:
For my ſelfe it ſufficeth to haue ſhewed
the way to others, whereby they
may garniſh and aduaunce the glory
of God and our Countrey.
            In fine, theſe and other many remedyes
ſondry Doctors haue dayly
found out, eſpecially in the falling



ſickeneſſe, wherein they haue founde
by good tryall and experience that
diuers infected with that diſeaſe, by
taking of this earth gotten in the
golden myne, haue béene throughly
deliuered, ſo as they haue not anie
time after béene touched with it.
            And therefore I heartely deſire
all ſuch to whoſe handes this earth
hath come, and who haue had any experience
of it, that if ſo be they happen
to haue any other experience of
it eyther by themſelues or others,
than a number of learned men haue
tryed (whoſe witneſſe of great credite
yea, euen of Magiſtrates and Princes
before whom it hath béene tryed
I haue ſet downe,) that for the comforte
of the diſeaſed, brotherly charitie,
and commodity of the vniuerſall
mēbers of Chriſt, they would vouchſafe
to ſend mee word of it hither into
Sileſia, where I remaine in a towne
called Kupfferberg, or to aduertiſe
the famous & moſt learned Philoſopher
D. Ihon Montanus Doctor in
Phiſicke, now dwelling at Striga.
            
            
               
Touching the names of both the
white and the yellow earth, to ſpeake
ſomething thereof, I truſt there is no
man that can iuſtly be offended with
me, in that I haue termed the white
earth digged out of the ſiluer mines,
by the name of mynerall vnycorne,
wherein I haue not ſo much here followed
mine owne fanſie (though it
may be permitted to the Inuentors
to giue names to ſuch things as they
haue found out) as the counſell and
aduiſe of the beſt Myners, and Doctors
of Phiſicke, who commonly giue
names according to the effect & quallitie
of the medicine, and not according
to the outward ſhape or ſhewe
onely, as the vnlearned vſe to doe:
Or becauſe I haue called the yellow
earth the greaſe of the Sunne, being
gotten out of the golde mynes, and
afterwards with great diligence prepared.
For I haue found by experience,
that the yellow earth hath the
ſame force and vertue in curing diſeaſes
that golde it ſelfe hath: as the
white hath the vertues of ſiluer. So



as good reaſon to mee it ſéemes, to
name them according to the thinges
whereof they take their force. If
theſe names diſpleaſe any man, the
partie may come hyther to the mines
where they growe, and conſider the
place, circumſtance, forme, and propertie,
of the thing, before he as vnſkilfull
in Mynerall matters, doe
maliciouſly blaſe abroad his fooliſh
writings againſt the ſecret workes
of God, or vpon a couetous conceit,
fearing that his Ritchin will be the
colder, if out of Germanie that may
be had at a ſmall price, which is hunted
for out of Araby, Turquy, and
the barbarous places there abouts,
with ſo great ſummes of monie and
with greater gaine retayled, although
not halfe ſo good as this
which we may haue with leſſe coſt by
much at home: Yet muſt they in the
meane time bee accompted greate
Doctors, becauſe they can ſkill of
ſuch thinges as are farre fetched,
though they neuer ſawe the place
where they grew, nor euer haue ſéene



them gréene or new gathered, as hath

                  •
               itherto happened of that excellent

                  •
               earbe Scordium, which beeing

                  ••
               ught by the Merchant out of far
Countries and ſolde at a very high
price, yet is now lately founde to
haue growen continually in Germanie,
both as fayre as that which commeth
from beyond ſeas, and of better
vſe for the bodies of our Germains
than the other. In like ſort falleth it
out with mynerals, mettals, and precious
ſtones, which as the learned
Storie wryter Sebaſtian Munſter
affirmeth, are now found all to grow
at home with vs, and are ſent abroad
into other Countries in great abundance,
which a hundred & fifty yeares
agoe were ſought for at ſtraungers
handes, and ſo diſtributed about.
            We that doe dayly with infinite
toyle and exceſſiue charges hunt for
theſe hidden treaſures in the bowels
of our olde mother the earth, doe euery
day finde new kindes both of mettals
and mynerals, that the olde writers
neuer knew of, nor thoſe that at



this day inhabit thoſe Countryes are
yet acquanted with, beſide the vnſkilfull
Doctors, and dwellers at
home, is it poſſible that theſe felowes
ſhould haue better knowledge of ſuch
thinges, as at home they were neuer
acquaynted with? neyther knowe
what kinde, ſorte, or nature they bée
of: than thoſe to whom they be moſt
familiar, and who dayly gather them
where they growe: Yet ceaſe they
not with their eloquent pennes, impudently
to lie & to deface the truth,
attributing to euery thing moſt fooliſh
& feyned names both in Greeke
and Latine, not waying the properties
and qualities of euery thing,
according to which the Lord God did
by Adam from the beginning name
them: but as ſéemeth beſt to their
fooliſh brayne, which fanſie of theirs
is as fooliſhly ſtill mainteyned, and
ſhameleſly defended by their followers,
alleadging onely this ſlender
reaſon, ſuch and ſuch a Philoſopher
hath ſaide it: which for the blindneſſe
ſake and vntruſtineſſe of the



parties they might rather haue déemed
to haue béene moſt falſe. And
thus not onely to God and his gifts,
but to their owne Countrey of Germanie,
theſe Doctors and Philoſophers
of Germanie are found to be
moſt iniurious, who deſpiſe the rare
bleſſings of God that are proper to
them and their Countrey: Onely
cōmending and deſiring ſuch things
as are gotten abroad, ſuppreſſing
with a vile kinde of minde ſuch
thinges as they haue at home, nay,
which is a fowler thing, they neyther
haue deſire to benefite their Countrie
nor their brethren, neyther will
they ſuffer others that would doe it,
but ſtudie continually how they may
with all ſortes of raylings and ſlanders
ſtoppe and deface the good and
laudable attemptes of ſuch as they
knowe to bee ſtudiouſly and honeſtly
giuen. Where it had béene a great
deale more méete for them firſt 
                  〈◊〉
               
haue giuen moſt heartie thankes to
God that in the latter dayes hath ſo
aboundantly bleſſed our Countrie of



               Germanie in bringing to light ſuch
infinite treaſures as hauing long
lyen hidde, are now through his mercie
found out, to the end that by continuall
beholding of them wee may
be called from the dungeon of darkeneſſe
to light, and to the amendment
of our liues. And euen of the verie
bountie and goodneſſe of their diſpoſition,
thou mayſt eaſily (good reader)
perceiue them whom God will
haue partakers of his hidden treaſures,
when as they doe not with iniuſtice
kéepe to themſelues the ſecret
knowledge which they haue receiued
from God, but ſéeke by all
the meanes they may to make them
common to all men, eſpecially to
thoſe that be good and godly: and for
the others, his good will is they
ſhould continually apply their ſtudies
to their priuate contentation,
and neuer atteyne to the knowledge
of the truth: And theſe good fellowes
vſe alwayes to kéepe in their owne
cuſtodie ſuch thinges as they them
ſelues haue no ſkill of, neyther will



they ſuffer ſuch as are of vnderſtanding
to haue the vſe of them. But let
vs leaue this kinde of people as withered
and rotten ſtockes, neyther
profitable to themſelues nor others:
And according to that which God
hath giuen vs, let vs bee fruitfull,
alwayes giuing praiſe and thankes
to God our mercifull father, not ſéeking
our owne honor or priuate commoditie,
who ſhal alſo make vs profitable
& fitte for his kingdome: with
which he hath promiſed to giue to vs
whatſoeuer we ſhall haue néede of, ſo
that we ſéeke for that kingdome before
all other thinges. To this onely
God who is & hath béene from euerlaſting,
bee euerlaſting honour and
glory.
            THe teſtimonials of the Princes
& Magiſtrats, who haue
ſeene before them the experience
and miraculus force of the Sileſian
Terra Sigillata: And there vpon
for the acknowledging of ſuch diuine
benefites, and extolling the



glory of God, haue vnder their
great ſeales confirmed the truth in
ſuch order as followeth.
            FIrſt an exemplification, that is
an abſtract out of the Germaine
originall faithfully tranſlated into
Latine, that the moſt noble Prince
William Landgraue of Heſſe in Caſſell
Court in Catzenelnbog, Ditz
Ziegenheim and Nidda, of his
great clemencie, did graunt to Andreas
Bertoldus of Oſchatz, by his
Doctors in Phiſicke and Chauncellour.
            
               BEe it knowen vnto all
perſons, that an honeſt
man called Bertold of
Oſchatz, came into the
preſence of the moſt noble
Prince and Lord, the Lord William
Landgraue of Heſſe Court of
Catzenelnbogen Ditz, Ziegenheim
and Nidda &c. our gracious
Lord and Prince, and in humble maner
declared vnto him, that hee had



found in an olde mine of Golde within
the dominion of Schueidnitz, a
new kinde of earth, which is a preſent
helpe and a moſt notable remedie
againſt all maner of poyſons and
ſundrie diſeaſes, which earth hauing
a ſtampe vpon it he offered to ſell vnto
his Excellencie: who not truſting
the man vpon his bare worde, committed
the matter to his Phiſitions,
Maurice, Thaurern, and Laurence
Hyper: Commaunding them to
make a perfect tryall of the ſaide
earth, wherevpon the ſaide Doctors
in Phiſicke to ſatiſfie their Prince,
did make a double proofe of this
earth, in this manner. They tooke
foure ſundrie ſortes of the deadlieſt
poyſons that might be, which were,
Mercurie Sublimate, Aconitum,
Nereum and Apocinum, and of
ſome one of theſe they gaue halfe a
dramme a peece to eight dogges, to
foure of them they gaue the earth after
the poyſon, and to the other foure
the poyſon alone: Of theſe foure that
tooke it alone, the firſt that tooke Apocynum,


               
dyed within halfe an
houre: the ſecond that had taken Nereum,
died within foure houres: the
third that ſwallowed Mercurie, died
within nine houres after: And although
they all did caſt vp ſome part
of the poyſon, yet after moſt cruell
tormentes with crampes and trembling
they died: the fourth dogge
that eat Aconitum, ſuſteyned thirtéene
great panges of the crampe, ſo
as euery man thought hee woulde
haue died with his fellowes, yet liued
he the firſt day, and hauing halfe
the doſe of this medicine giuen him,
he throughly recouered. The other
foure dogges to whom the poyſons
before named with the like quantitie
of this Terra Sigillata was giuen,
for three houres after the receiuing
of it, were very ſicke and feeble, eſpecially
one of them to whom the double
quantitie of Aconitum by negligence
was giuen, vomited thriſe:
the next day they were all well and
did eate their meate greedily, ſo as
there appeared ſcarſe any token of



poyſon. When thus his Highneſſe
had ſéene the experience of this earth
to bee ſo preſent a remedie againſt
ſuch deadly poyſons, & that the ſaide
Andrew Bertold had humbly craued
his letters of credite, both in the
fauour of the man and aduancement
of the truth, that others might haue
knowledge, he denied not to graunt
them: But commaunded that his letters
teſtimoniall ſealed with his
Highneſſe his priuie ſeale, and ſubſcribed
with the handes of the foreſaid
Doctors, in whoſe preſence this
tryall was made, ſhould be giuen vnto
him. Which we the abouenamed
Doctors vpon our allegiance to his
Highneſſe, and for the furtherance of
the truth, becauſe we found it as hath
béene declared to be true & vnfeyned,
moſt willingly haue done. Giuen
the xxviij. of July, the yeare of our
Lord, 1580.

               IN the yeare of our
Lord 1580. the day
of Saint Iames: In
the preſence of the
moſt noble and worthie
Prince William
Landgraue of Heſſe there was made
of the Terra Sigillata brought vnto
him by Andreas Bertholde of Oſchatz
this proffe vpon certain dogs.
            A redde Dog with a white ring
about his necke had giuen him betwéene
eight and nine in the morniug
a ſcruple of Mercurie ſublimed, and
a ſcruple of the Terra Sigillata therewith:
within halfe an houre after the
ſeconde houre he vomited extremely,
the thirde houre agayne hee caſt vp
certaine colloricke matter, ſo did hée
the fourth houre, and without anie
great harme he eſcaped.
            A yellowe Cur with a whit breſt
had giuē vnto him a ſcruple of Mercurie
ſublimed and nothing after it,
within halfe an houre after he made
water and preſently after hee ſcummered,
within halfe an houre afterwards



he was taken with a Crampe
and fell to the grouude, after this
Crampe he ſtode vp a while panting
and grinning, and preſently after
was againe taken with the crampe,
and withall ſwelled in the bellie: at
one of the clocke he was taken with a
more gréeuous Crampe and lay as
though he had beene dead for a quarter
of an houre, within halfe an houre
after two, he began againe to goe, and
for an houre and an halfe afterwards,
he ſtod ſtill without mouing: betwene
foure & fiue, he was againe extremely
taken with the crampe and ſundrie
times after, at laſt he died in ye night.
            A blacke little hound with a white
taile, had giuē vnto him a great dram
of Aconitum, and therewith a dram of
this earth, within halfe an houre afterward
he vomited extremely & within
halfe an houre after, he caſt vp certain
frothie matter, after the firſt houre he
vomited the third time & ſo eſcaped.
            A branded ſhaghairde dogge with
a white tayle had halfe a drame of
Aconitum giuen him and nothing
herewith, within an hower hee was



taken with a great Crapme and 
                  〈◊〉
               
king one houre after that abou
                  •
                
               
                  〈◊〉
               
of the clocke hee was taken 
                  〈◊〉
               
with the crampe ſundrie times, 
                  〈◊〉
               
wiſe after one, and halfe an houre after
two hee fell into the Crampe agayne,
ſo did hée at thrée a Clocke,
after thrée he was extréemely pulled
with the crampe, and by and by after
had the like fit wherewith he made a
great quantitie of water, that ſtonke
horribly, then was he againe touched
with the Crampe, when as there was
giuen him at the commandement of
our gratious Lord the Landgraue of
Haſſe halfe the doſe of this ſuffraine
medicine whereby he recouered and
eſcaped.
            A blacke Curre with a white necke
had giuen vnto him halfe a drame of
Nerium or Oleander & halfe a drame
of this earth, within one hower after
the taking of it, he vomited extremely,
and within a little after he vomited
gréene bagage, within halfe an
hower after he frothed and foomed at
the mouth, this was the fainteſt and



weakeſt dog amongeſt them all, yet
did he preſently recouer and ſcape.
            A browne Cur with a white necke
had giuen vnto him halfe a dramme
of Merium and nothing of the medicine.
Firſt he vomited a thin matter
about tenne of the Clocke he vomited
againe, after twelfe hee was
taken with a great quaking and a
terrible crampe, which fit was verie
long and extréeme: afterward he was
pulled with the crampe till almoſt
thrée, after thrée he was terriblie racked
with the Crampe, and betwéene
thrée and fower he died.
            A gray little begle had giuen vnto
him a drame of Apocynum halfe
leaues and halfe rootes and withall a
dram of this Terra Sigillata. This
dogge as farre as we could diſcerne
was not al the day long any wiſe vexed,
but eſcaped verie well.
            A branded dog had giuen vnto him
a dramme of Apocynum halfe roote
and halfe hearbe and nothing of the
medicine, within halfe an hower after
the receite of the poyſon, hee was



taken with an extréeme crampe and
quauering, and within a verie ſmale
while after he fell ſodenly dead to the
great wondering of thoſe that ſtoode
by.

            A copie of the Letters Pattents
which the noble earle Wolfgan earle
of Hohenloe, Lord of Langenburg &c.
Had graunted to Andrewe Bertolde
of Oſchatz, in witnes of the wonderful
vertues of the Terra Sigillata,
found latly in Germanie which hath
ben tried to be an approued medicine
againſt the ſtrongeſt poyſons,
and ſundrie other grieues: faithfully
tranſlated out of the Germayne
Originall.
            
               WE Wolfgangus Earle of
Hohenloe, Lorde of Langenburg,
&c. Do openlie
make knowen vnto all
men by theſe my Letters



Teſtimoniall, that there came lately
before me at Langenburg, my welbeloued
friende Andreas Betholdus of
Oſchatz, and declared vnto mee that
he had a moſt excellent kinde of Terra
Sigillata, which was not al onely of
great force againſt ſundrie diſeaſes:
but alſo a moſt vndoubted remedy againſt
all manner of venemous poiſons,
as had béene prooued by ſundrie
witneſſes vpon a great number of
dogges, which made me alſo deſirous
to ſée the triall of it. It happened at
the ſame time, that one called Wendel
Thumblardt was by our Lieuetenant
of Langenburg for certaine fellonies
impriſoned, who being examined
by our Iuſtices, confeſſed himſelfe
guilty of a great number of robberies:
And therefore brought to the
barre was condemned to bee hanged.
Being yet deteined in priſon, & comming
to his eare that there was ſuch
a medicine, ſo ſoueraigne againſt
ſundrie ſickneſſes, and the moſt deadly
poiſons, hee made humble requeſt
as well by his parents, as by other



his friends, of which there were preſent
no ſmall number, deſiring for the
mercie of God, & reſpect of his poore
life, that being thus condemned, hee,
might haue giuen vnto him the moſt
deadly poiſon that might be deuiſed,
whereby a perfit triall might bee had
of the worthines of this medicinable
earth. And in this reſpect, not onely
for this pittifull requeſt of his: but
alſo for the commoditie and benefite
of all Chriſtendome, (if ſo be the medicine
prooue anſwearable to the report)
pardoning the offender, wee
graunted his life vpon that condicion.
Therefore the day of the date of
theſe preſents, in the preſence of our
ſelfe, and our welbeloued Coſin the
Countie George Friderick of Hohenloe,
and Lord in Langenburg, and in
the preſence of all our Nobilitie and
Commons, the ſaid patient receiued
a dram and a halfe of Mercurie Sublimate,
mingled with Conſerue of
Roſes, & immediatly after it he drank
a dram of the Terra Sigillata in olde
wine. And albeit the poiſon did in the



iudgement of our learned Phiſition
George Piſtor Doctor in Phiſicke,
and Iohn Lutzen our Apothecarie,
who were both by him all the while,
extremely torment and vexe him: yet
in the end the medicine preuailing ouercame
it, whereby the poore wretch
was deliuered, and being reſtored to
his health was committed to his parents.
Whereas therefore the foreſaid
Andrew Berthold, hath humbly
required io haue our Letters Teſtimoniall
for his farther credite, wee
haue thought good for the furtherance
and aduancement of the truth,
to graunt him theſe our Letters, ſigned
with our ſeale Manuell. Giuen
at Langenburg the 25. of Ianuarie,
in the yeare of our Lord. 1581.
            The copie of the Letters Teſtimoniall
granted by the Magiſtrats
of the Citie of Iuliers vnto Maiſter
Criſantus a Cronenbnrg, Citizen of
Coleine, in the name and behalfe of
Andreas Bertholdus of Oſchatz, touching
the force and vertues of the



ſealed earth lately found in Germanie.
Truely drawen out of the dutch
originall.
            
               WE the Maior and Aldermen
of the Towne of Iuliers
doe ſignifie vnto all
to whome this preſent
writing ſhall come, that
there preſented himſelfe before vs
one Criſant of Cronenburg a ſubſtantiall
man, and Citizen of Coleine, declaring
vnto vs that hee had an aſſured
remedie againſt all poiſons, called
by the name of Terra Sigillata,
Axungia Solis, S. Pauls earth, or
Adams earth, being made vp in diuers
trociſks, ſome of them reddiſh
in colour, ſome Greyiſh, ſealed with a
ſcutchin wherein is portrayed the
Sunne, the halfe Moone, and fiue
Starres. In place of the helmet
theſe Letters, A.B. and on the other
ſide V.O. Who beſéeched vs to giue
him leaue to make triall in our ſight
of the ſaid earth vpon certaine doggs
and beaſtes. Which when wee had



graunted, the ſaid Criſantus did will
to be brought before him two great
dogges of like colour and bigneſſe,
and therewithal two Crowns weight
of Mercurie Sublimate, which he deuided
in our preſence, and in the ſight
of Iohn Oitweilers our ſworne Surgeon,
into two equall portions,
whereof the one hee gaue alone in a
péece of Larde to the one dogge, the
other parte of the poiſon he gaue to
the other in a péece of Larde béeing
mingled with the quantity of three
Trociſks of the Terra Sigillata. Both
the doggs in our preſence deuoured
the portions that were throwen vnto
them, and both vomited and grew to
be very féeble, ſixe houres after the receiuing
of the poiſon, the firſt dogge
that had taken the poiſon pure without
any of the earth, dyed. The other
which had receiued the Terra Sigillata
with the poiſon, remained ſafe and
aliue, and being ſhut vp for a day, after
was ſuffered to goe at large. Sith
theſe things we ſaw to be true as they
bee reported, we thought good to



graunt to the before named Criſanti
                     ••

chief Notarie there, conferred with
the true originall, ſealed & ſubſcribed,

the louing Reader.
            BE it knowen vnto al and ſingular the
ſtudious, and ſearchers out of the
treaſures of nature, that for their owne neceſſitie
or their friends, deſire to be pertakers
of the wonderful & medicinable force
of the Terra Sigillata of Sileſia: as well
for recouering & kéeping of their health,
as to be preſerued from all deadly poiſon:
That I Andrew Berthold of Oſchatz,
vpon the mountaine called Kupfferberg,
dwelling néere vnto the Golden riuer named
in the Germaine tongue the Bober,
about ſeuen miles from the head of the riuer
called the Elbe, haue béene earneſtly
required by ſundrie Doctors in Phiſicke
and other men of name, to leaue ſome
quantitie of this precious earth in ſome
place néere vnto the Rheyn, ſpecially at
Franckfort, where in my abſence, as oft
as occaſion ſerued, it might be had. When
as therfore I cauſed theſe books to be printed
by that vertuous man Chriſtopher
Coruin a Printer, & Citizen of Franckfort:
I thought it good not any where better



leaue it, than with him who might vtter
it at a reaſonable price to all ſuch as
haue néede of it: which I could hardly intreate
him to trouble himſelfe withal, but
onely in reſpect that he had printed the copies.
Wherefore I entend, God ſparing
me life, to ſend abroad euery Marte not
onely good ſtore of this earth, but alſo certaine
precious ſtones needfull in Phiſicke:
As Rubyes, Emeralds, Saphyrs, Iacincts,
Carnelins, Citrins, Chryſtals, Serpentins,
Amethiſts, Garnats, and ſuch like.
And whoſoeuer lacketh any ſtones belonging
to Phiſicke or otherwiſe, he ſhall be
ſure at the ſaide Coruins to haue not onely
them, but alſo the earth ready prepared,
which our mercifull God hath beſtowed
vpon Germanie, for the common profit of
all Chriſtendome. To which almightie
Lord be all honour, glorie, and praiſe, for
euer and euer.
