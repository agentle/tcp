                  This name Albanus by enterpretation

                  Made whyte alſo with lylyes of clenneſſe
                  with whyte roſes ment ſtable in theyr rudeneſſe
                  It was well ſene that he ſtable ſtode

                  Thus was the chapelet made of red and whyte
                  whyte for his clennes I haue ſo tolde aforne

                  Curiouſly the trouthe to declare
               
               
                  
                  Amphibalus is entreated by reaſon
                  On the goſpell to grounde his proceſſe
                  And to confirme his diſputation
                  Of holy writte he toke iuſtly wytneſſe
                  Howe our beleue recordeth in ſothneſſe
                  Of god the father and god the ſonne alſo
                  This is our belefe take good hede therto
               
               
                  The ſonne moſte perfyte & moſte good
                  For mans helthe and ſaluation
                  was incarnate and toke fleſſhe and blode
                  And ſemblably for ſhorte concluſyon
                  Of his moſte benigne conſolation
                  Ryght ſo as he firſte made man in dede
                  So come he downe to take our manhede
               
               
                  And as hym lyſte of grace and of mercy
                  By his power / whiche that is deuine
                  Ordayned maydens to lyue here parfytly
                  So he agayn warde playnly to determyne
                  Toke fleſſhe and bloude of a pure virgine
                  The tyme come there was none obſtacle
                  But that he wroughte his maruaylous myracle
               
               
                  The tyme approched of grace and gladnes
                  Towarde ſommer whan the luſtye quene
                  Called Flora with motleis of ſwetenes
                  Clothed the ſoyle all in newe grene
                  And amerous Veer / agayne the ſon ſhyne

                  So in the ſeaſon heuenly and deuine
                  Of wynter ſtormes was paſſed all outrage
                  And in the rayne Phebus gan to ſhyne

                  Lyke as Luke in his goſpell ſayth

                  whan Gabryell lowly gan abrayde

                  By grace of god and fauour of fortune
                  All that he ſayde was done with reuerence
                  Of gentylnes he was not importune
                  Suffered all thynge with humble pacience
                  Albeit ſo he gafe no full credence
                  To his doctrine of thynges whiche he tolde

                  Amphibalus ſatte all that longe nyght
                  Vpon his knees as gods owne knyght
                  For loue of Albon with great deuotion

                  Touchyng his dreame / newe freſſhe and grene
                  Vnderſtode not what it ſhulde mene

               Tyll it fyll ſo that turmentours
               Perceyued well they were not treatable
               Howe theyr ſorowe was intollerable
               Of compaſſyon lyſt no lenger ſpare
               Of all this thynge the trouthe to declare
            
            
               All ſodeynly they began to abrayde
               Theyr deedly ſorowes and playntes to refrayne
               Of the moſt worthy of the towne they ſayde
               O citezyns / why lyſt ye ſo complayne
               Leue your wepyng / your teares doth reſtraynt
               For by report of vs that were preſent
               Voyde of diſceyte or meanyng fraudolent
            
            
               
               ye haue more cauſe of gladneſſe than wepyng
               And greatter matter of conſolation
               Than of diſtreſſe or of complaynyng
               For if the grounde be ſought out by reaſon
               Touchyng your frendes ſlaughter and paſſyon
               ye haue more grounde vs lyſt not for to fayne
               For to be glad / than for theyr deth to prayne
            
            
               By ſondry tokens that were contemplatyfe
               Of ſignes ſhewed / the deed beareth wytnes
               Theyr deth was entred in to euerlaſtyng lyfe
               Ende of ſorowe concluded on gladnes
               From this darke valey went vp to bryghtnes
               where day departed is from the nyght
               And bryght Phebus leſeth neuer his lyght
            
            
               It is accordyng full well to nature
               A man to wepe for frendes that be dede
               But agayn warde by recorde of ſcripture
               For Chriſtis ſake / who lyſt his blode to ſhede
               A thouſande folde ſhall receyue his mede
               And for his lyfe / whiche is but tranſytory
               Eternally to abyde and lyue in glory
            
            
               where is no complaynt / nor no parte of ſorowe

               And for ſuche folke mydday eue and morowe
               It were wodenes for to make ſorowe

               Touchyng your frendes ſlayne in batayle
               whom that we dyd ſo mortally aſſayle
               All this conſydered to complayne ye do wronge

               Touchyng the ſtory to all theyr entent

               By the prayer of Amphibalus

               Felly aſſayled with many a great turment
               Shewed no token of ſorowe nor grudgyng
