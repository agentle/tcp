               THE Spouse of
Christ (right
Honorable)
who lyeth in
his bosome,
heareth his
voice, that is
his word: &
keepeth his sacraments in the integritie,
which she receaued. This
glorious title of his wel-beloued
the Church of Rome doeth falslie
arrogat. For she hath preferred her
owne decrees to his word: to the
one sacrament she hath 
                  •
               dded oile,

spittle, salt, and creame: From the
other she hath taken away the blessed
cup of his precious blood: she
hath set vp in his chaire the man of
sinne: she hath giuen his office of
intercession to Saints, and Angels:
She hath made his house a denne
of theeues, and a market of merites
masses, pardones, and other pelfe,
selling heauen, and hell for siluer,
and golde. Whereby it is cleare to
all men that hath not drunke of the
wine of her fornication, that she is
not the spouse of Christ, but the
skarlet whore, that sitteth on the
beaste with seauen heades, and
hath poysoned the nationes of the
earth with her abhominationes. It
is the guise of a whore to disgrace
the lawful spouse, to whose bedde
shee presumeth, what lyeth in her.
To this end this strumpet hath per
secu
                  •
               ed the welbeloued of our Sauiour,
euer since she gote vppe her
heade. And nowe in our dayes

slandereth her with the opprobrie
of a whore, neuer harde of before
the dayes of Luther. To meete
with this contumelie, I haue contriued
this little treatise the laste
winter, at such houres as I coulde
borrowe of my bed: because my
calling holdes me occupied at other
times. In it I haue taken for
one of the surest notes of the true
spouse, the sacrament wherein he
communicateth him self, and all
his graces with her. Firste I gather
be seauen argumentes drawen out
of the well of truth, the true meaning
of the wordes of the institution
(this is my bodie) containing
the right maner howe Christ feedeth
vs with his precious body, and
bloode. Secondly I proue be their
owne testimonies that the fathers
of the primitiue Church, receaued
that sense from Christ, and his
Apostles, and kept it, as they receaued
it 500 yeares after the firste institution.

Thirdlye I proue the occasion
of the corruption: and how
it sprang, and grew with the truth
like darnell amongst wheate without
offence for the space of 300
yeares. Fourthly I shewe howe in
the yeare 800. it beganne to 
                  •
               appe
the truth, and that some grewe either
so impudent, or ignorant as to
denye a figure, and maintaine a literall
sense in the wordes of the institution.
Fifthly that aboute that
same time Ioannes Scotus in the time
of Charles the greate, & Bertrame at
the commandement of Carolus Calvus,
opossed them selues, & refuted
that erroure, whereby it maye
seeme, that that noble Prince was
of the same mind. Sixthly that the
better sid cōtinued long a partie, &
that these books were not cōdemned

                  •
               il the counsel of Lateran 250.
yeares after they were published.
Seuenthlye that this counsell condemned
Berengarius vnhard for an

hereticke, and the truth which hee
mentained of heresie. Lastly I followe
the storie, that the Church
of Rome euer since persecuting
the truth with fire, and fagot could
neuer get it extinguished. That it
had alwayes assertoures, and many
that sealed it with their bloode.
In which discourse my intent is to
proue that the church was planted
in the truth be Christ, & his Apost.
not be Caluin or Zuinglius as our
aduersaries beareth the ignorante
in hand. That there hath beene alwayes
since a Church professing it.
That the Church of Rome euer
since the Counsell of Lateran aboute
550 yeares hath persecuted
her. That this little barke howbeit
driuen into manye obscure harboures,
yet all the stormes which
the deuill, and antichriste coulde
raise, hath not sunke her. This little
treatise I haue thought good to
dedicate to your Wisdomes: because

I, and al my trauelles am consecrated
to your common wealth.
Accept my good will, and protect
the truthe with your authoritie.

            TO M. IOHN
Hammilton his olde Regent,
grace, and right
iudgment.
            
               HEaring great report
of a booke, which you
had set out, I met
with your treatise intituled
of the Lordes
Supper, printed anno
1581. supposing that your comming
home had stirred the mindes of men to
read and praise the thing, which had
lyen long dispised: I red also with hope
to find the arguments, that induced you
to turne your coate. But finding no
thing, which you might not, and in all
appearance did not knowe before your
peruersion: I pitied your miserable case
who hath a hearte at one time capable
of contrarie persuasions of your saluation▪
               
and was woe, how be it it be worthie
no answere, that our men had let it lye
19. yeares without an answere: because
it seemed that that silence had made
you confident, and your sectaries hope
that it was vnanswerable. Wherefore
thinking it to be the worke so much spoken
of, I resolued to doe it the honoure,
that no man thought it worthie,
and set my selfe to answere it, because
you were some time my Regent.
After that I had answered the firste
cap. and a good parte of the seconde:
there came to my handes your seconde
worke. Then I perceaued my erroure, &
stayed my hande to read it also. Hauing
red it, I rewed al, For argumēts in both
I founde none indeede, and few in show.
To flite, which is the greatest parte of
both these bookes, I thought it meeter
for a scoulde then a scholar. And the
last I founde contrarie to the firste, not
onely confuting, but condemning of
heresie the verie inscription thereof.
Your greatest gift for anye thing that I

can see is in nik-naming, and beleing
the Saints of God. That gift we can wel
be contented to leaue to papistes: because
such graces are more acceptable
to your pope, then our God. Some of you
hath purchased Bishoprickes, and some
Cardinalshipes, be that kind of eloqūece
But wee are assured that he, whome wee
serue, neuer rewardeth that arte with
better hyre then hell. Yet I wonder at
your impudencie, or rather stupiditie,
to hope that naked lies can win credite,
euen where the men of whom you speake
are most hated. Can any man beleeu
                  •
               ,
that if GOD had showen so notable a
iudgment on Iohn Knoxe in the pulpite,
and presence of such a frequent assemblie,
as vseth to be in the Church of
Edinburgh, the people woulde not haue
onely abhorred his doctrine: but stoned
him selfe out of the towne. Or can anye
man that hath a mans harte (that is
reason and vnderstanding) beleeue,
that if Iohn Caluin had vsed that
manifest iuglarie, which ye are not ashamed

to publish in the face of the
Sun, in the congregation at Geneua,
that that people, who found the moyen
in a priuate grudge to banish him their
towne for certaine yeares: would not, on
such a notorious cause as that, haue either
stoned him in the streetes, or expelled
him at the leaste with shame for euer.
But this is a note of gods iudgment,
that hee hath so besotted your senses,
that you haue not the wittes to caste a
probable collour vpon your lyes. This
was an other cause, that made me leaue
my purpose to confute your booke. For if
I had gone fordward, I sawe that I was
to meete with many slanders, which
was not worth the hearing, nor reading
and needed no other to confute them,
then the mouth that toulde them: if the
hearer had but halfe a nose to smell alye
as whote as a foxe. Yet hauing spent
many dayes, and nights in gathering
materialles to that worke, I resolued
not to lose them: but with some trauell
contriued them in this forme, which you

see: hoping that the power of reason and
truth might not onelie staye such from
that erroure, as your sectaries had made
to doubt: but also make you, and them
to doubt of that, which you teach so confidently:
if you would read as aduisedly
as you haue bequeathed your selfe vnconsideratlye
to that abhomination.
And heare I charge you in the bowels,
and mercies of lesus Christ, as you will
answere in the great daye of the Lorde,
if you doubt indeed (which is not likely
for anye matter that wee can see in your
bookes to haue turned you) or left the
truth for any particular, to open your
eyes againe to the light, and to returne
to the grace from which you are fallen.
I haue heere deduced the truth of this
question whereon standeth the foundatiō
of the Romane religion from Christ
to our owne times. I haue taken this
paines partlie for our people, partelye for
you, to whome I wishe the good that a
Scholar should to his maister. And
therefore I praye you, as you loue to liue

for euer, to leaue the way of death euerlasting.
Otherwayes in the court of conscience,
where truth will be reuealed, &
the popes indulgence will doe no good,
I must beare witnesse of your wilfulnes,
and proude contempt of the reuealed
truthe. The Lorde giue you a harte to
loue him better then men.
            
               Yours if you be Christes,

            The diduction from the
fountaine.
            
               OVR Lord and
maister Iesus
Christe, that
night that hee
was betrayed,
into the hands
of the highe
preiste to continue
in his Church a solemne remembrance
of his blessed passion, which hee
was shortly to suffer: instituted at his
last supper with his disciples; after that
hee had finished the lawe of the pascall
Lamb, in place there of a newe Sacrament
in the Elementes of Breade and
Wine. In this and with this after an vnspeakable
maner, be a secret diuine efficacie,
hee deliuered also to their Faith
his precious Bodie and Blood, to vnite
them, and al that should succeede them

to be bone of his bone, and flesh of his
flesh, to nourish their soules vnto eternal
life. In this mystery there is such a secret
cōiunctiō betweene the elements
and his precious flesh, that in al ages it
hath exercised the hearts and minds of
men in the deep contemplation thereof
some to life, and some to eternall death
and condemnation. For seeing the glorie,
and excellencie of our omnipotent
God, consisteth in the highest perfection
of mercie, and iustice: his infinite
wisdome hath tempered his worde and
Sacraments to minister matter to both.
Therefore betweene his elect, whose
heartes he illuminates with the light of
his spirite: and those whome he hath left
to the iudgment of their owne fenses,
and illusions of errour, there hath risen
out of this cloude greate stormes to exercise
his Church, that it might not lye
sleeping in the sonne of securitie. It is
fortie yeares and mor
                  •
               , since the Lord
                  •
               
beganne to sowe in this countrie being
then ouerwhelmed in the mists of ignorance
the seede of his eternall trueth.
Now seeing our vnthankfulnes, hee suffereth
the enemie to repaire home againe,

and to sowe darnel in his haruest
He is busie, and we are secure. Wherefore
to meete his practises, and to arme
the simple against his sophismes, I haue
chosen this argument of reall presence
as of greatest importance to confute all
papistrie. For if the naturall bodie of
our Sauiour is not in the sacrament (as
they call it) of the altare, they haue no
sacrifice for the quick, and deade, and
wanting that, their market of masses
this fiue hundreth yeares hath beene a
faire of false wares. In this disputation I
will vse no rethoricall colloures, to fill
mens eare
                  •
                with wordes: but shortely
will ayme my arguments to the poynt,
hoping that in all sounde iudgementes
weight of reason will be more effectuall
then the ratling sound of emptie words.
I will deduce the truthe of this poynte
out of the well of truth, and then will
proue the Church to haue receiued it
from Christ and his Apostles: and notwithstanding
the craft, and crueltie of
the enemie to haue kept it sincere, and
pure to our times. Lord shew to me the
the light of thy truth: put weight in my
wordes, and force in may arguments to

beare thy truth through the middest of
thy enemies and to confounde the wisdome
of the wise.
            Our Lord and Sauiour at the institution
of this Sacrament, tooke breade:
and after that hee had giuen thankes
broke it, and gaue it to his disciples saying,
Thus is my body, which is broken for you
this doe ye in remembrance of me.
            
            The wordes this is my bodye, the
Church of Roome taketh literallie, 
                  •
               ffirming
that the breade is turned into
the very natural, & reall body of christ,
hauing no nature thereof but collour,
sauour, taste, and other inseparable accidents.
            Wee on the other side, take them figuratiuelie,
denying that there is anye
change of the substance: but that the
bread remaineth bread representing to
our soules the bodie of Christ to feede
our soules to eternall life.
            As for the wordes them selues without
other inforcements, they are capable
of both senses, we grant that if both
scripture & nature did not denye, they
maye be taken literallie. Againe that
they may be taken figuratiuely, if the

peruersnesse of the aduersarie will not
grant, other scripturs in the same forme
will easilie conuince.
            He that saide of the bread This is my
bodie, saide likewise of him selfe I am a
vine, I am a doore, and Paull saith the
rock vvas Christe. But these words inforces
not a literall sense, that hee is a verye
doore, vine, or rocke. Ergo, these wordes
inforce not literallye that the breade is
his bodie, The speaker is one, the forme
is one, and there is nothing in the one
which is not in the other, to inforce a
literall sense. Of this see more in the answere
of Maister William Reinoldes
fourth replye to Maister Robert Bruce
cap. 19. hereafter pag. 96.
            This ground being laide that these
wordes are as opportune 
                  •
               o a figure, as
to the letter wee ioyne with these men
vpon a new conclusion, that the figure
is moste consonant to the truthe, and agreeable
with the scriptures.
            To begin then, my first argument
is taken from the name, and nature of a
Sacrament. No sacrament is the same
thing, which it signifieth. The bread &
wine in the Lordes Supper are sacraments

of Christs body and bloode. Ergo,
they are not the thing which they
signifie: that is, they are not the body, &
blood of Christ, The first part of this argument
is a rule of nature deliuered vs
be a common consent of all the learned
before the dayes of ignorance, and papistrie.

               aliud significantia. Sacraments are
signes of thinges being in deede one
thing, and in signification an other. The
answere here that the accidents are the
signe, and that the substance is changed
is a tricke of Romane iuglarye without
warrant of the word, or testimony of any
father, for eight hundreth yeares
after the institutiō of this sacrament. Of
this see more hereafter in defence of
Maister Robert Bruce against Maister
William Reinold. cap. 19. reason. 2.
            My next reason shal be from the analogie
of the sacraments of the new &
olde couenant. The sacraments in the
new couenant, are the same to Christe
now commed, that the sacraments of
the olde couenant were to Christe to
come, But the sacraments of the old couenant

were types, and figures of Christ
to come. Ergo, the sacraments of the
new couenant are types and figures of
Christ alreadie commed.2. Cor, 10▪ 3.
                     ••
                  
                The proposition
Paull confirmeth. The fathers did all
eate the same spirituall meate, and did all
drinke the same spirituall drinke. And Aug.
sacramenta iudaeorum in signis diuersa fuerunt
a nostris, in rebus significatis paria. That is,
the sacraments of the Iewes did differ
from ours in signes; but are the same in
signification.Ioan 
                     〈◊〉
                   26. The assumption the aduersarie
cannot denye.
            Thirdly, I reason out of Christs own
words after that hee had absolued the
hole action, and his disciples had al eate
of the bread, & drunk of the wyne: I wil
(saith he) no more drinke of this fruite of the
vine,
               Ma
                     ••
                  . 14 25. 
               while I drink it. laying this foundation
which I hope no man can denie, that
the breade is no other wayes his bodi
                  •
               
then the wine is his blood. The fruite of
the vine is not the naturall bloode of
Christ. But that which he had consecrated,
& his disciples had drunken, he calleth
that the fruite of the vine. Ergo,
that which hee consecrated, & they had
drunken was not his naturall blood, &

be like reason that which they had eaten,
was not his naturall and reall bodie.
The proposition being a negatiue of
things disparate, and diuerse is not deniable,
and the assumption is a text vttered
be the mouth that could not lye.
            Fourthly, the order of the institution
Iesus the night that hee was betrayed tooke
breade, and giuing thankes broke it, and saide
take eate this is my body that is broken for
yow, yealdes vs this argument. That
which hee broke, was the same which
they did eate. But Christ tooke breade
and broke it, not his essentiall bodie:
Ergo that which they did eat was bread
and not his essentiall bodie. The proposition
is manifest in the wordes as they
lye. he tooke bread, hee brake it that is
breade: hee bade his disciples eate that
same bread, and of it saide, this is my body
which is broken for you. That which hee
tooke hee broke: that which hee broke
he gaue them: that which he gaue them
they did eate; and that which they did
eate, he calleth it his bodie. To applye
the verbes following, to an other thing
thē that, which the first verbe is ioyned
with, is to teare Christs wordes in sunder;

and to parte the thinges, which hee
spake coniunctly. The assumption is
the very text. And further, when hee
broke the breade, Christ had not vttered
the wordes, bee vertue whereof
these men holdes that the breade is
changed into the bodie of Christ.
            Fifthly, out of the same wordes we
                  •
               
drawe this argument. The thing which
he gaue them was his essentiall bodie,
as the breaking of it, was the breaking
of his bodie. But the breaking of the
bread was not the breaking of his body
for our sinnes, as it was done vpon the
crosse. 
                  •
               rgo, the bread was not that same
essentiall body, which was broken on
the crosse, but in a figure. The proposition
is true▪ because as hee saith of the
breade it is his bodie: so hee saieth with
one breath, that it is his bodie broken,
this is my bodie broken for you. The assumption
is true, because the bodie of Christ
was not broken before his passion: and
because the breade was broken in peeces,
which his bodie was not.
            Sixtly, it is saide in the sixt of Iohn
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood
dwelleth in me, and I in him. Which words

yealdes vs this reason: Hee that eateth
the flesh, and drinketh the bloode
of Christ dwelleth in Christ; and Christ
in him. But all that eate the sacrament
dwelleth not in Christ, nor Christ in
them. Ergo, not all that eateth the sacrament,
eateth the flesh, and drinketh
the bloode of Christ. The proposition is
the text: the assumption the great heap
of vnworthie receauers doth proue.

He that followeth not Christ eateth
not his flesh, nor drinketh his bloode:
how-be-it hee dailie receaue the sacrament,
of so great a mysterie to his damnation.
Which sentence afterward in
B. and C. hee laboureth to answere
without sense, or sentence. That the
wicked eateth the proper flesh of christ
which was borne of the Virgine Marie:
but not the spirituall flesh of Christ,
which is receaued onely, be faith & vnderstanding.
We reade in the scripturs
but of one flesh of Christ, which was

borne of the Virgine Marie: & suffered
on the crosse for our sinnes. Of this flesh
saieth Christ, whosoeuer eateth dwelleth
in me, and I in him. But the wicked
saith Lumbard eateth this fleshe, and
so bee his worthye sentence the wicked
dwelleth in Christ, & Christ in thē. The
faith which beleeueth, or vnderstanding
which conceaueth anye other flesh of
Christ then this, beleeueth and vnderstandeth
the thing that neuer was. Of
the wicked,1, Cor, 11, 27 Paull saith, hee that eateth
this breade, and drinketh of this cuppe
vnworthely, eateth and drinketh his
owne damnation. He saith, not hee that
eateth the bodie, & drinketh the bloode
of Christ vnworthely. And heare I dare
lay my heade, which I will not giue for
the popes heade, and his triple Crowne
too, that all the Schooles in Roome and
Remes, shall neuer proue be the Scripture,
that the body of Christ can be eaten
vnworthely. Howe oft doth hee promise

            Seuenthly, in the fore cited wordes
of Paull.1, Cor, 11. 17. 
               He that 
                     •
                  ateth of this breade, and
drinketh of this cuppe vnworthelie, ea
                     •
                  eth and
drinketh his owne damnation. We find this
argument. The elements in the Sacraments
remaine that which Paull be the
spirit of God doth call chem. But Paull
be the spirit of god doth cal them bread
and wine, and that after the consecration,
or else they coulde not bee receaued
vnworthely, nor drawe on so heauy
a iudgment, as to be guilty of the Lords
body, and blood. Ergo, the elements in
the Sacrament remaineth, breade and
wine, and are not changed into the naturall
bodie and blood of Christ. Heare
the base shift, that the Apostle vseth,
the names which they seeme for the

names which they are will not houlde,
for that were to feede the errour of
the fenses, and to brangle the foundation

then any that our aduersarie

fifth, and sixth, concludeth the negatiue
that the breade, and wine, are not the

The second proueth, that they are

of these seuen arguments, four erefutes
the aduersarie, and three confirmes the
truthe.
            
               Nowe that the Church maintained
this truth, as she receaued it from Christ
and his Apostles; for more then fiue
hundreth years after Christ I wil proue
bee the the testimonies of the fathers,
who liued, and taught the Church in
that age. And heare I woulde praye the
reader not to mistake me. I alleadge
not these testimonies to confirme this
truth as not sufficiently proued already
or to ad more authoritie to the testimonies
of the scripture, for we acknowledge
the authoritie of the word of God
to haue that Maiestie, that if all the
world did say against it: yet it remained
the certaine trueth of the eternall God,
who is trueth it selfe, and can not lye.
And wee greatly lament the miserie of
this age, wherein there is so many foūd
and of them some, who knew the truth,
to oppose them selues against so manifest
a light. But seeing bee the peruersnes
of man, and malice of the deuill it
is controuerted: in my simple iudgment
the consent of the Church is no small
inducement to indifferentmen, and a
great slap in the aduersaries saill, who
beares the world in hand that they saill

before the wind, and that all the fathers
of the primitiue Church, doth rowe in
their bardge. Which confident assertion
how false it is, I hope with gods good
help, to make it manifest: and to proue
be their owne wordes, that none of the
fathers did euer know that transubstantiated
monster, which was whelped in
the counsell of Rome fiue hundreth
yeares after them, and after that fostered
in the bosome of that Church. To

it to be a figure, in dispite of the pope, &

the breade in the Sacrament doth nourish
the body, passeth through the belly,
and auoydeth into the draught, which
were an absurd thinge, to speake of the
precious flesh of our Sauiour.

That is, if you see the sonne of man

the Lordes blood, the one carnal, where
with we are redemed: the other spirituall,
wherewith wee are anointed. To
drinke the Lords blood is to bee partaker
of his puritie, and incorruption.

As the breade growing out of the
earth, receauing the Lords institution,
is no more common breade: but the eucharist
consisting of two things the one
earthlie, the other heauenly. So our bodies
receauing the eucharist, are no
more corruptible hauing hope to rise

againe.
            Be these fathers it is cleere, that the
substance of the bread abideth: and that
the eucharist, that is the communion of
thankes giueing consisteth of an earthlie,
and a heauenly thing.
            To conclud this matter, Chrysostom
saith in Vasis sanctificatis non ipsum corpus
Christiest: sed mysterium eius continetur. In
the sacred vessels, the verie bodye of
Christ is not but a mistery thereof.
            And August, saith more peremptorily.
Non hoc corpus, quod videtis, manducaturi
estis: non bibituri sanguinem, quem fusuri sunt
qui me crucifigent: sed sacramentum vobis aliquod
commendaui. You are not to eate the
bodie which you see: nor to drinke the
blood, which they are to shed, who will
crucifie me. But I commended a certaine
mysterie to you, &c.
            In these places which I haue quoted,
you haue plainely without any glosse al
that we teach, and beleeue of this sacrament.
That the words of the institution
are figuratiue: That the action of eating
and drinking these mysteries is spirituall:
That the bodie of Christe, is receaued
b
                  •
                faith, not be the mouth: That the

wordes of the institution are to bee taken
literallie: That the body of Christe
which suffered for our sinnes, is in heauen,
& not in the Sacramēt: That to eat
the flesh of Christ is to beleeue in him:
That the substance of the breade, and
wine abideth, and is not transubstantiated:
And lastly, that the body of Christ
is neither in the holie vessels, nor eaten
be them, who receaueth this sacrament.
All these thinges I haue heere proued
(I saye) in plaine categoricall wordes,
which the aduersaries can not avoide,
without most odious and absurd gloses,
which the actours neuer knewe, nor
thought. Yet not-withstanding, they
vendicat these fiue hundreth yeares, as
the other fiue hundreth also, vntill the
dayes of Berengarius, and beareth the
ignorant in hand, that all is theirs without
contradiction. They haue such a
confident grace in shamelesse lyes. But

to iudge betweene vs, and them indifferentlie.

of all which I dare promise the diligent

which speaketh the thing, which hee
woulde haue. In them all hee hath neither
founde transubstantiation of the elements,
nor accidents without subiects:
nor subiects without accidentes,
nor the bodie of Christ rent with teeth,
nor that the accidentes are the outward
signes in the sacrament: nor that

                  •
               he bodie of Christ, is at one time, both
in heauen and all other places where
the sacrament is ministred: nor any other
of these new theoremes of the Romaine
faith without a glose, and that
sometimes impertinent; sometimes obscurer
then the text, sometimes repugnant
to the text, and alwayes peruerting
the true sense of the author. I
hope that no man will count these allegationes
equiualent, except they proue
all the theoremes, and appendices of
transubstantiation as cleerelye as wee

haue done. Notwithstanding whate
uer they or we can doe in this kinde, is
no proofe of the truthe, but a witnes of
the consent of tymes.
            Nowe in this place followeth next to
be considered howe this monstrouse opinion
of transubstantiation began to
insinuate it self into the heartes of men
in the ages following, for from this time
forth it beganne dailye to grow, and to
gather strength. In the mysterie of the
sacrament, there is such a secrete, & sacred
coniunction of Christs blessed
flesh, with the seales as we can not well
vnderstād, nor is lawful for vs curiously
to enquire: but reuerentlye to beleeue:
that his bodie is the bread, which came
downe from heauen, and giueth life vnto
the worlde. On Christs parte by the
secret and vnseene efficacie of his diuinitie
hee conuaieth him selfe into our
soules to feede them vnto eternall life.
On our parts there is an action iointly
of the soule and bodie, the one receauing
the elementes with the mouth of
the bodie: the other receauing the body
and bloode of Christe bee the mo
                  •
               th of
f
                  •
               ith. In this action the whole powers of

the soule, and body are occupied at one
instant applying all the comforts of the
senses to the soule. The mouth tasting
sweetnes, presents sweetnes to ye soule:
the stomach receauing refreshment,
mindeth the soule of refreshment: The
vitales receauing strength, comfort, &
life offers to the soule, the strength, comfort,
& life: that floweth from the bread,
of which, who-so-euer eateth, shall neuer
hunger nor thirst againe. To printe
this analogie into our heartes, and to
lift our senses from the sensuall consideration
of these present obiects, to the
spirituall contemplation of his absente
flesh, it pleased the wisdome of our Sauiour,
to name the figures of breade and
wine his bodie, and blood, broken and
shed for the faithfull partakers of these
mysteries. And that he doth not changing
the substance as these men woulde
haue vs weene: but turning the vse of
bodilie meate to present to our deepe
speculation, the meate that feedeth the
soule to eternall life. This besides the
places alredie cited, Theodoret about
foure hundreth yeares after Christ teacheth
as resolutelie as euer did either

Zuinglius or Caluin, his wordes ar these
faithfullie translated because they are
ouer long to set downe in his owne language.
Our Sauiour changed the names, to the
bodie giuing the name of the signe, and to the
signe giuing the name of the bodie. His purpose
is mantfest: for he would haue them, who did
participate his diuine mysterie to haue no eye
to the thing, which they sawe: but bee changing
the names to apprehēd the change made be
grace. For calling his naturall bodie bread, &
meate, and calling him self a vine, hee honoured
the signes with the names of his bodie and
blood, not changing their natures, but adding
grace to nature.
            
            This example of our Sauiour, all true
preachers in all ages, who laboured to
instruct the heartes of men in
these mysteries followed: & when they
sawe the mindes baselye contented,
with the externall action, manie tymes
they amplifyed the presence of Christe,
with hyperbolicall argumentes of his
diuine power, to lift the heart from the
elements, to the thing presented be the
elements. For as mariners, betweene
two dangers in the seas, beareth of
that which they moste feare, towardes

that which they leaste suspect: euen so
these teachers drew the people frō the
elements subiect to the sense towards a
bodely presence, contrarie to sense, neuer
surmizing, that men woulde bee so
credulouse as to take such hyperbolical
amplificationes for simple suthes. The
deuill who hath alwaies beene reddie
of good to take occasions of ill, watered
this weede with all helpes. Firste
hee bred in the heartes of men such a
colde regarde of these holye mysteries,
that few resorted to them, as it appeareth
be the grieuous complaintes of the
fathers of that age, and lawes made be
sundrie emperours to mende that fault.
Be this meanes he so incensed the harts
of them, who had the hādling of them, y•

                  •
               iciēt to
amplify the presēce of Christ in ye sacrament,
& with high speeches to imprint
a reverent estimatiō of these sacred mysteries
in the dull heartes of the people.
This continued well nye three hundreth
yeares, without suspition of ill.
With the opinion of a corporall presence
the deuil drew in be little and little,
that the verie bodie of Christ offered

to the father in the masse was a sacrifice
propitiatorie for the quick, & dead:
and the people (as wee are all borne to
superstition, and idolatrie) imbraced
that more gredelie then any truth. The
Clargie spying the masses to become
good marchandise, and hopeing for
greate cheates to the kitc

               in bee that
market, put to their shoulders, & lifted
the sacrifice aboue the sacrament. So
this weede grewe dailie, as weedes
commonly growes fastest, till few could
find the truth, & that onely such as diligently
sifted the Scripturs, and fathers
of former times. It was long before men
grew so brasen faced, as to denye the figure
in the words of the institution. The
first that wee reade to haue commed so
farre was Damascene, about the yeare
eight hundreth. After him followed Pas
casius, and Theophylact wel nye a hundreth
yeares. These men broke the yce
to them that followed: but pearsed not
into the depth of this diuinitie, Transubstantiation
of the elements, accidents
without subiects, and subiects
without accidēt
                  •
                the monstruous brude
of the Romane Church were not yet

clecked. She had not yet sit vpon that
egge, neither was these men yet so well
resolued as vpon all occasions to sing
one song. They dissēted in many things
from them that followed, and in sundry
thinges from themselues. At this tyme
and before this monster grew to a head
the Lord raised vp one Ioannes Scotus
besome tearmed Erigena paedagoge to
the worthye Emperour Charles the
great, a man of great learning, and well
red both in Greeke and Latine. This
man wrote a learned work, against this
erroure, and in the beginning of it began
to descry the firste conception and
whole genealogie of this mōster. Soone
efter followed an other called Bertram
a preist, or as some thinkes a monke of
Corsbie in saxonie, where Pascasius also
was bred. This booke is yet extant,
wherein hee learnedly cites the fathers,
mightely vrges the scriptures, and providently
preuents the whole matter of
transubstantiation. This worke and the
author also Tritemius highlie commendeth,
both for life and learning. It
escaped, I can not tell bee what diuine
prouidence, the fyrie purgatorie of verselles,

in the flames whereof the booke
of Ioannes Scotus was quite consumed.
Yet there was an other prouided for it be
the Doctors of Louan, & be the counsel
of Trent called index expurgatorius, not to
consume all (for that would haue beene
a discredit to the holye Church) but to
raze such sentences as were vncureable
and where it woulde serue the turne to
charge no thing but the affirmatiue into
the negatiue, substance into accidents,
temporall into eternall, &c. That
is to saye, white into blacke, lighte into
darkenes, and truth into a lye. These
two book

at that time began to persue their brethren
with fire and fagott: and made
Lawes, to compell all men to beleeue
vnder paine of both deaths temporall,
and eternall, that a rounde wafer, with
the picture of Christe in it, was the very
essential body of Christ, that was borne
of the virgine Marye. This was more
like to haue beene the loose deuill and
the lying deuil to, which euer since hath
raged in these partes, then that of Berengarius,
which was soone bounde againe,
and vnder paine of burning compelled
to fing tongue thou lyed. If that

haue beene done in one day. But if these
books were not plaine with vs, I would
aske of Maister Reinolds, why the pope
burned the one, & the index expurgatorius
mangled the other. But wee are
much beholden to him, how-be-it

he denieth vs this antiquitie: yet hee
would faine haue it beleeued, that our
doctrine was condemned of heresie, in
the very daies of the Apostles. To proue
this,Dial3 cap 19 he quotes Ignatius out of Theodoret,
who saith, that some acknowledged
not the eucharist to be the flesh of christ
that suffered for our sinnes. These some
heritiekes he woulde haue taken to bee
men of our minde, that in those times
denyed transubstantiation of the bodie
of Christ. Yet if he had marked with advised
iudgmente the drift of Theodoret
(for out of him the meaning of Ignatius
is to be gathered) hee might haue seene
that Ignatius spake of such heritickes
as Theodoret alledges him againste: or
else the allegation of Ignatius had been
impertinent. But Theodoret alleadged
him against Valentinian, Marcion, and
Manes, who denied Christ, to haue suffered
reall paines in a reall bodie. Ergo
Ignatius spake of heritikes, who denied
Christ to haue suffered reall paines in a
reall bodie. For as odious as wee are in
Maister Reinolds eies, it will be as hard
for him to conuince vs of this erroure, as
to make the place of Ignatius other

wayes to bee spoken of vs. This argumeut
of Ignatius was common amongst
the fathers againste that heresie: that if
Christ had not a true body, and suffered
not reall paines for our sinnes, the sacrament
could not bee a figure thereof.
As Tertulliā reasons before, because mē
vse not to make figures of phantasies.
And heare it will be harde for Maister
Reinolds, to clenge his hart, and hands
of falshoode, and forgerie, for alledging
Ignatius out of Theodoret against that
which Theodoret plainely & frequently
teacheth: that the sacraments are Tou

the debate in France, which Bertram
maketh mention of, that the right side
was then also a partie, and that, the better
part. For transubstantiatiō (for now

that tearme was clecked) stoode Odo
Archbishope of Canterburie garded
with a greate armie of rascall ignorante
preists, who woone their dayly drink by

aboute the yeare one thousand and fifty
Berengarius deacon of Sainte Maurice
in Angieres, wrote a letter to Lanfrancus
abbat of Bec-heloin in Normandy,
declaring the abuses of the Sacrament,
and commending vnto him Ioannes
Scotus his learned work vpon that question.
It fell out that Lanfrancus himself
was then absent, and his conuent opening
the letter sent it to the pope. There
the Pope summoned a counsel and condemned
the man being absent of heresie
and commanded Lanfrancus at that
tyme being his freind, to answere him
vnder no lesse paine then to be as great

an hereticke as he. Lanfrācus following

was, satisfied them & Hildebrand also,
prouing his doctrine be the Scriptures,
fathers, and counselles to haue beene
the ancient faieth of the Church. But
pope Nicolas the second, not contentented,

with this summoned him to
Rome againe, to a counsell helde in the
Castle of Lateran there: and drawing
him thither with faire promises, gaue it
him to his choise, whether he would recant
or burne. Where the cowardlie
man, now in his oulde age, for feare of
that, which was moste spent, made that
beastly recantation, which is yet extant
in Gratian, a perpetuall argumente
of his dasterdlye courage, and the
brutishe ignorance of that counsell, of
which the fyner papistes since hath
beene ashamed, and their owne glosse
saith in the decreits, that if it be not wel
taken, it is a fouler erroure, then was
that of Berengarius. Thus was that sillie
man counted before (as recordeth
Fuldebert bishop of Cenomanum) both
for life and learning, the flowre of his
age, compelled againste his conscience
bee a hersel of ignorant mules to condemne
and curse the truth, to his great

                  •
               reife, and terroure in the houre of his
death. After this the truthe beganne to
sinke, and ignorāce ouerwhelmed almost
the whole Church. The knowledg
of tongues decayed and he was counted

the greatest clarke that coulde speake
most barbarous Latine: and teare out of
whole peces, such distinctions as would
haue troubled all the schooles in Athenes
to vnderstand. Notwithstanding this
cruell dealing with Berengarius Benno
Cardinall of Hostia recordes, that Gregorte
the seauenth, before called Hildebrand,
who at the commandement of
Victor the second, had hard Berengarius
him self in the counsel of Towres, remained
so vnresolued heereof, that hee
sent to Anastatius, to praye, and commanded
his Colledge to fast, to get
some secret reuelation from heauen, of
this mysterie. By which doubt of the
pope himself, it should seeme, that the
reasons of Berengarius were not lighte,
that sunke so deep into his heart (as hard
as it was) that the hole sea of rome 
                  •
               uld
not wash them awaye. After this, this
truth was still persecuted, till these our
times be the wolfes of Rome, that gote
the custodie of Christs sheepe, bee
hooke, and crook, and forged falshood.
The first that we reade of, to haue abide
the flames of this purgatorie (for now it
was growen hotter, & burned not onely

bookes, but both booke, and bodie,

doctour in Tolouse of great account at
that time, and many flocked to his lessons,
of all degrees. Hee for his laboure
was burned quick, for that was now become
the stipend of truth, how-be-it it
had beene as cleare as the sunne, if the
pope of Rome allowed it not. Notwithstanding

other part of France, I cannot finde the
name of the place, and a prieste at Lismoore
in England of the same opinion▪
The centuries calleth them sacramentaries
that they might no more goe without
a nikname, then their fellowes. About

the yeare, one thousand one hundreth
& three score, there was in Lyons
one Waldus a Merchant, for welth and
wisedome of good account. This man
walking in the fields, for repast as some
writeth, or on the counsell of the towne
as other recordes, sawe one in the companie
fall downe deade. With which
spectacle entring into a deepe speculation
of the frailtie of this life, and the
vanitie of our cares s
                  •
               t on a thinge so
fraill, hee turned his studies to prouide
for the life that lasteth without ende.
Wherefore hee got him a Bible which
booke in those times was rare in the
handes of the Laitie, & not so frequent
in the hands of the Cleargie, as worse
bookes: and like the man in the gospell

                  •
               o buye the Iewell of the kingdome of
heauen, spent the rest of his trauels (for
hee was learned) to seeke out of it the
true water of life. The thinge which hee
learned him self, hee imparted to his familie
and catechised it. His maner of
teaching was so familiare, & effectual,
that sundrye of his neighbours, resorted
to his house to heare him. This congregation
grew frequēt, & the priests grew

angrie. Wherefore like dogs in a manger,
that neither can eate the haye, nor
will let the horse, they charged him, to
let that labour alone, and not to put
his hooke in their haruest, except hee
would doe worse. The man caried more
with conscience, which straited him;
then caring for their boaste, whome he
sawe doe no other good, but roare in a
Church: followed his godly course, and
his neighbours for all the feare refrained
not his house. Whereupon they
excommunicated and cursed him with
bell, booke, and candle, and al his followers,
and confiscated al their substance.
There they sundred some seeking this
waye, and some that, where they coulde
finde any succour: and woone where euer
they came the praises of good life,
and godly learning, being named commonly
in waye of pittie, pauperes Lugdunenses,
the poore of lyons, as they were in
deede stripped out of al and left as pure
as Irus. Some of them went into Lombardy,
some into Boheme, & some setled
at home in Prouince, Guien, Langue
                  •
               ock,
&c. In Bohem being delated
to the King bee ane Doctour Austine,

they wrote to him a confession of their
faith most sounde, and Catholicke, mistake
me not, I meane not Romane Catholicke,
but that which Christ deliuered
to his Apostles, and the Apostles to
the Church, and the Church to this
houre hath kept pure, and cleane, as
they receaued it, and vnmingled, with
the dregges of mans witt. But to our
purpose, they who setled at home gote
noe long rest. They were dayly and
heauely persecuted, by the Bishopes
Arelatensis, Narbonensis, Aquensis, &
Albanensis. They possessed two townes
called Cabriers, and Merindoll till our
dayes, that is to saye, till the yeare, one
thousand fiue hundreth fortie fiue, and
the vaile of Angroingu
                  •
               . The Bishope
had accused thē to the Parliment of Aix
for defection from the Catholicke faith.
The Parliment had giuen out sentence
that they should haue beene destroyed,
man, woman, and childe. And their
Towns, & Trees, euerted be the rootes.
This bloodie sentence, laye ouer fiue

and their mercilesse enemie, at the request
of the Bishope, delated them to ye
King falsly, that they were all in armes
against his Maiestie, and bee moyen of
the Cardinal Turnonius, got the Kings
letters patent, to take the forces provided
for the English warres, to meete
them. This bloodie monster, atchiued
with crueltie the thinge, which hee had
begunne with a lye, and put to the
sworde, those two townes, and two and
twentie villages about, without mercie
of sex, or age. It were horrible and tedious
to tell the perticulares. Let them

with the greate regrate of their neighboures,
destroyed among whome the

Lord till then had preserued to himselfe
a Church, worshiping and seruing
him, according to his owne word.
Nowe hauing deduced this doctrine to
our owne times, it remaineth to open
the hidden mynes, through the which
these men hath drawen this rotten water,
as out of the well of life, where-with
this eight hundreth yeares they haue
poysoned many milliones of soules.
            The foundation that they laye to
raze this monstruous worke on, is the
wordes of the institution. This is my body▪
which is broken for you. To mentaine in
these wordes a literall sense, they pervert
the true sense, of many places of
scripture, and to null a figure in this
place, they force many monstruous figures
on other places, they denye common
sense, they pervert nature, and at
one worde, they mingle heauen and

                  •
               arth together. Before I buckle with
their arguments, I hope this reason shal
satisfie any minde, that will heare reason,
that these wordes are not evident
ynough, to lead our faith to such a monstruous

importance to lead the heart of
a Christian, to a persuasion contrary to
sense, and abhorring from nature. But
these words of the institution, wil beare
an othe
                  •
                meaning. Ergo, these words of
the institution, are not of sufficient importance,
to leade the heart of a Cristian
to a persuasion contrarye to sens
                  •
               , &
abhorring from nature. That the words
will beare an other meaning, admitting
both a figure, and the letter, is proued
alreadie. That the persuasion is monstruous
no man seeth not. That 
                  •
               eeing
breead, feeling bread, and tasting bread
it is not bread, which thou eatest, but
the very flesh of Christ, which thou neither
seest, feelest, nor tastest, is againste
sense. To rend with thy teethe, and put
downe into thy foule bellie, the precious
bodie of Christ, which was broken
for thy sinnes, beside Cannibal crueltie,
were impious inhumanitie. And therefore
the scripture, that must induce the
faith to beleeue a thinge so contrarie to
faith should be single, simple, pregnant,
and vncontrouleable. And now to their
arguments.
            The first is, that all sacraments shuld

consist of simple,M, Iohn hammiltō con, and plaine wordes
without ambiguitie, but figuratiue
wordes, are not plaine and simple without
ambig
                  •
               itie. Ergo, Sacraments shuld
not consist of figuratiue wordes. Firste
this argumente destroyeth vtterly the
na
                  •
               ure of a Sacramente. For as August.
teacheth, all Sacramentes are visible
signes, of vnvisible graces, that is seene
figures of graces, which are not seene.
As for plainesse, figuratiue speeches are
many tymes playner then they, which
are without all figure. As for the wordes
whereon we stand, there is no speeche
more vsuall, when men presentes themselues
be lots, then this is I, and that is
thou. Mistake me not, I haue proued alredie
sufficiently, that the sacrament is
not a naked figure. As for ambiguitie,
will these men set the eternall worde of
GOD to the schoole, and 
                  •
               each him to
speake? What if the spirite of God will
haue his word so tempered, that it may
be the sauoure of life, to them that liue,
and the sauoure of death to them that
dye. Doubtlesse his sheepe knowes his
voice, and hee goeth in and out before
them. He maketh them rest in greene

pastores, and leadeth them to the still
waters As for his enemies, he hath tempered
their cuppe with galle, and mad
                  •
               
the worde of life to bee a block in their
way. He hath left ambiguities for heritickes
to waken his Church out of the
dreame of securitie. It is good (saith he,)
that offences be: but woe to them bee
whome they come. And in this poynte
it is a wonder, to see how God hath infatuated
the 
                  •
               ense of these men, to seeke
a knot in a rushe, and to force a senslesse
sense on his worde against sense.
            Secondly out of the same words they
make this argument. That which Christ
divyded amongst his disciples, was his
bodie broken for them. But his essential
bodie was broken for them. Ergo,
that which he deuided among his disciples,
was his essential bodie. All this
we confesse to be most true, as our Sauiour
spake it, that is sacramentallie. That
which he deuided amongst his desciples
was sacramentally or figuratiuelye his
bodie, which was broken for them, that
is his reall and essentiall bodie in a figure
but not bee transubstantiation or
mutation of the bread into his bodie.
            
               Thirdely, they vrge hard this letter I
am the bread that came downe from heauen.Ioan, 6,
And againe, my flesh is meate in deede, gathering

               defaine
playe faire playe, and displaye their arguments
in their best geere. But it will
not bee for mee without a manifest, and
seene blemish. Yet if it can bee (for I acknowledge
my owne weaknesse) the
answere is cleare, and reddie. Christes
flesh is the meare of the soule, and not
of the bodie, of the minde, and not of
the mouth. It is eaten be hearing,De res
                     ••
                   carnis chawed
bee vnderstanding, and digested bee

teacheth him selfe, who knew it better
then the pope without sauing his holinesse,
and all the Iesuites to helpe him.
I am the breade of life (saith he) he that commeth
to me shall not hunger,
               Ioan 
                     •
                   53 
               and hee that beleeueth
in me shall neuer thirst. Out of which
words this argument floweth. To come
to Christ and beleeue in him, is to eate
the breade of life, that thou neuer hunger
nor thirste againe. But to come to

Christ, and beleeue in him is not to eate
with thy tethe the reall flesh of Christ,
which was borne of the Virgine Marie.
Ergo, to eate the reall flesh of Crhiste
which was borne of the Virgine Marie

Which Syllogisme adding the proposition,
may haue this forme. Whosoeuer
beleeueth in the breade of life hath
euerlasting life. But I am the breade of
life. Ergo, Whosoeuer beleeueth in me hath euerlasting

                  , Maister Rainolds againste
Maister Robert Bruce reasoneth thus.
Christes bodie is there present, where it
is broken. But it is broken in the sacrament.
Ergo, it is present in the Sacrament.
To the maiore we answere that it
is present in the Sacrament, as it is broken
in the Sacrament. But it is broken
onely in a figure, and therefore is present
onely in a figure. But to the faithfull
Christ presents in deede bee a divine
communication with the Sacrament
his verie bodie to feede the soule.
Bvt if he wer bodily in the Sacrament,
then the wicked would also participate

his bodie: which thing Christ himselfe

                the same man in the same
place reasoneth out of the wordes of
Moses concerning the olde couenante,
and the wordes of Christe concerning
the newe thus. That whereof Christe
spoke is the bloode of the newe Testamēt,
as 
                  •
                whereof Moses spoke, was the
blood of the olde. But y• whereof Moses
spake was the verie bloode of the olde
Testament. Ergo, that whereof Christe
spoke, was the verie bloode of the newe
Testament. Of this argument, we deny
the minor. The blood of both couenants

                  •
                one, the bloode of Christ Iesus, who
made the vnion in the olde Lawe, betweene
god & them, & maketh the vnion
in the new Testament betweene god
and vs. The blood of be
                  •
               es in the olde
testamēt, was not the very blood of the
covenant. And therefore this man hath
founde a knife, to cut his owne throate.
The wine of the newe Testament is the
bloode of the newe couenant, as the
bloode of
                  •
                beues and sheepe, was the
bloode of the olde couenant. But the
bloode of beues and sheepe, was not

the very blood of the olde couenant, but
a figure thereof. Ergo, the wine in the
new Testament, was not the very blood
of the couenant, but a figure thereof.
            Lastly, they cast vp to vs incredulity,
and not beleeuing the omnipotencie of
Christ.M, Iohn hammiltō of the L. supper They beare the worlde in hande
that wee denying Christe to turne the
bread into his bodie, are more incredilous
then sath
                  •
               n, who beleeued, that he
coulde make breade of stones. To cast
this sweete simile into the teethe that
it came from: These men are as captious
as the devill. Hee reasoned a potentiae
ad actum, If thou arte the Sonne of GOD
command that these stones bee made
breade: they follow the same 
                  •
               rade: hee
was the sonne of God▪ Ergo, he changed
the breade into his flesh. The question
is not heare, what Christ could doe, but
what he would doe. We know and confesse
as wel, as they, that Christ can doe
what he will: but will not doe all that
he can. To proue that Christs will was
to doe a thing▪ (as I haue said) so contrarious
to nature, & so refuted bee sense,
it behooueth the testimonie to be without
exception: That Christ was borne

of a virgine, that he walked on the waters,
that hee turned water into wine,
(these are the exemples of their induction)
the spirit of truth that cannot lye,
hath t
                  •
               stified in plaine tearmes. If that
spirit had testified as plainely, that in his
last Supper hee turned the breade into
his bodie, and left nothing to our taste;
but accidents, we should beleeue this as
well as that, and bee Gods good helpe
haue stoode as surely to it, as all the Iesuites
since the first Iesuit Ignatius Laiola.
            But seeing these proofes are no

their naked skinne: wee hope that all

is, that it is our parte, when wee receaue

enter into our thoughtes, that wee receaue
breade and wine: but assure our
consciences, that Christ bee the secrete

them with their owne circumstances,

of the water, and to force it to
beare yron. Where you see that the
water was not changed into a more solide
bodie, but the naturall liquiditie

speaketh Ciril of the water in Baptisme.

the bloode of Christ, how-be-it the reason
be as good to saye this as that. Bee
these examples I woulde haue the circumspect
reader warned, that when
he readeth in any of the fathers, that

Where firste note that hee calleth it

Maister Robert Bruce,Cap 
                     •
                   sect 5 alleadgeth two
places out of Ambrose, which being
weighed in these confiderations will
proue no transubstantiation.De iis qui untiantur cap. 9 Ambrose
comparing the efficacie of Christes
wordes with the words of Elias, at laste
concludeth if his wordes were of such
force that they caused fire to come
downe from heauen: shall not Christes
speach be of sufficient force, to alter the
nature of the elements. First the Latine
worde (which hee interpreteth nature,

is species elementorum, The shapes
of the elements which it is certaine to
the sense remaineth vnchanged, and so
the wordes beareth a manifest hyperbole.
It is true that Ambrose in that
place vseth sundry high amplifications,
not to persuade the breade, to be transubstantiated
into the essentiall bodie
of Iesus Christ, but from the authoritye
and power of the consecratoure, to settle
into the heartes of men, a dreadefull
account of the consecration. That this
is his drift, it is plaine in the same place,
Where he saith, ante benedictionem rerborum
coelestium alia species nominatur, post
consecrationem corpus Christi significatur:
Before the celestiall blessing, an other
forme is named, after consecration
Christs body is signifyed (saith hee) not
in deede transubstantiated. For that
which doth signifie his bodie, can not
be the same thing which it signifieth.
            In the other place,De sacr
                     •
                  , lib, 4, cap, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                Ambrose teacheth
that the consecration is made bee
the wordes of Christe, the selfe same
whereby all things were created, and
after a long induction concludeth, it
was not the body, but breade before

secration: but after when Christs words
came there to, then was it the bodie of
Christ. (and addeth) thou seest then
how many wayes, the speach of Christe
is able to change all thinges. This long
induction of Christes power (as I haue
saide) is to noe other ende but bee the
powerful consecration of the elements,
to settle a resolute persuasion in our
heartes of Christs presence, which is the
vnseene subiect of our faith. That Ambrose
knewe not transubstantiation of
the elementes, it is plaine in that same
cap: also. Where he saith, Si tantavis in
sermone domini fuit, vt inciperentesse, quae non

                     •
                  rant, quanto magis operatorius est, vt sin
                     •
                  
quae erant, et in aliud commutentur. If there
was such power in the worde of the
Lorde, to make thinges beginne to bee
that they were not: howe much more
powerfull is it to make thinges byde
that which they were before, and to
be changed into an other. Where note
that he saith the bread, and wine abideth
the thinge, which they were, that is,
breade and wine, which these men denieth.
And a little after warde hee saith,
similitudinem pretiosi sanguinis bibis. Thou

drinkest the l
                  •
               kenesse of that precious
bloode. In the cap. following also hee
calleth it figura corporis, et sanguinis, A figure
of the bodie and bloode of our
Sauiour Iesus Christe. If Ambrose had
thought the elementes of breade, and
wine, to be the essentiall and reall body
of Christ, hee woulde neuer haue called
them similitudes, and figures thereof. If
these men woulde buckle that opinion
on Ambrose, or anye other father,
let them produce him in his monstruous
coloures of accidents, without their
naturall subiects, and subiectes without
their naturall accidents, and substance
changed into substāce. For we are surely
persuaded that transubstantiation
was neuer beleeued before these
strange theoremes were vniuersallie
receaued. And if they cannot find these
theoremes, which muste haue rung in

had beene receaued, before the

for so his wordes soundeth howe farre
forth these wordes are figuratiue. If this
be his meaning, it is an other new lesson
such as nature neuer bred. August. that

sillie man had neuer beene at this
schoole. In all that booke De doctrina
Christana hee knowes no other senses of
wordes but figuratiue, or proper. The
wordes of Christe, Except you eate the flesh
of the sonne of man▪
                he denyeth to bee proper,
and so concludeth them to be figuratiue.
Now commeth in Maister Wiliam
Rainoldes with howe farre figuratiue:
as if they might bee three or foure
inches in the tope, or the bottome figuratiue,
and all the reste of them proper.
This is strange diuinitie. It maye goe in
the Church of Rome, among their false
miracles: but wee admitt noe miracles

Rainlods, muste make this place either
all together figuratiue, as doth August.
or else altogether proper which August.

            Now hauing deduced this cause to
our owne times, and opened how these
men pulleth the mouthes of the fathers
aside, to make them speake their phantasies:

it remaineth, because I heare that
some men braggeth of Maister Will.

Robert Bruce, to lay open his quicknes:
For my part I wonder what sharpnesse

            Maister Robert Bruce reasoneth
thus.Cap, 18, sect, 1, No finit body can be at one time in
sundry places. Christes bodie euen now
glorifyed is finite. Ergo, Christes bodie
now glorified can not be in sundrie places
at once. To this and other two arguments
takin from visibility, and palpability,
hee answereth without anye authority,
but his owne, That these things
are no more necessary to the bodye of a
man, then to eate, drinke, sleepe, reste,

increase, decrease, & weare to corruption.
Now marke his sharpnesse, to eate,
drinke sleepe, &c. are no longer necessarye
to a mans bodie, then it lyueth a
life subiect to alterationes. But to bee
finite, visible, and palpable, are necessarie
to a bodie being deade, risen againe,
and euen glorifyed in the kingdome of
heauen. Our Sauiour after his resurrection,
was seene of moe then fiue hundreth.
Thomas and sundrye others felt
him, and when he was at Emaus with
the two disciples: he was not in Ierusalem
with the other nyne, for as neare as
it was: and when hee was in Ierusalem
with the eleuen, hee was not in Ierico
nor no other place of Iudea nor of the
worlde. And heere the ingenious reader
maye see, that his sharpe answere
shutteth beside the marke, and hitteth
no part of the argument.
            To three places of August.Ad Da

                  d In Ioan tract, 3, that the
bodie which is not in some place, is not

Lord rose, must be in some place. And
that all bodies bee they greate or small

                  •
               
of Christes bodie in the sacrament. This
laste is easie to bee beleeued. Augustine
neuer thoughte Christes
reall bodie as it was borne of the Virgine
Marie, to bee in the breade of the
sacrament: and therefore it is liklie that
hee spake not, of the thinge, which hee
knew not. Yet this man saith, that hee

teacheth of Christe, that hee was like
vs in all thinges, sinne onely excepted:
and so his bodie must bee in all thinges
like our bodies. Now in the place quoted
bee Maister Robert Bruce Saint
August. speaketh of all bodies in generall,
and therefore of Christes bodie also
euen in the sacrament, if it were in
the sacrament. And heare I woulde
praye the reader, to marke a tricke of
Romaine Logicke, to haue no exception
from an vniuersal axiome, but onely
the thing in question where of the
doubt is whether it be or not.
            To a text out of the Actes of the Apostles,Actes, 
                     •
                   vers, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
               
that the he auens must containe Christ
till all thinges be restored, hee answereth
with a perhapes (such credit these men
giueth to the eternall truth) that it may
proue Christes bodie to bee in heauen:
but that it is no where else, hee vtterly
denyeth it to proue,Cap, 1
                     •
                   sect, 
                     •
                  
                except it bee in
the reprobate sense of a sacramentarie.
This you see is well sayed to it. And yet
for all this boulde face, I hope this argument
will holde in the sanctified sense
of a chosen Christian. He that saith the

finite bodie of Christ is in heauen, denyeth
it to bee any where else. But Peter
in this place saieth, that The finite bodye
of Christ is in heauen. Ergo Peter
in this place denyeth the body of Christ
to be in anye other place, till all thinges be
restored. &c. This answere it seemeth
that he mistrusted, and therefore fleeth
to a better shift, and denyeth the text.
The wordes are translated verbatim out
of the greeke and latine also. For in
these words the fintax of bothe languages
agreeth. Hon dei ton our anon dechesthai.
Quem opertet caelum capere. Whome
the heauens must containe. In deede
they are not thral in english to the peruersnesse
of a wrangler, as they are in
greeke & latine. If that be a falt it is the
falt of the language, & not of the translator.
And therefore that these wordes
were neuer spoken be Peter, nor written
be Luke: but forged bee Maister
Robert, or some phanaticall brother of
his sect: is a thudde of Maister Rainold
his choller, which manye times
blowes lowder then his loue. As to the
English Bible of Kinge Edwardes time
we are not bounde to it. That Christe

muste containe the heauens vntill the
time that all thinges be restored, which
he must containe also after that restitution,
is ouer impertinent and vnproper
a sense to shoulder out the other lyeing
so plaine to the wordes, and containeing
an assertion, that the aduersari
                  •
                can
not denye. Moreouer it is to be marked
that to bring in that sense, the accusatiue
Onranon which praeceedeth the
verb, must violently be cast behinde the
verb, which thinge to auoide an inconvenience
were tollerable: but to bringe
in a nedlesse and imperfect sense is perversnesse.
            Next Maister Robert reasoneth.Cap, 1
                     •
                   sect, 3
Euerie humaine bodye is visible,
and palpable. Christes bodie if it be in
the Sacrament is a humane bodie. Ergo
Christes bodie if it be in the sacrament,
is visible, and palpable, This argument
he calleth the weakest of all, for it
is a parte of these mens facultie to crye
when they are sorest bitten, that they
feele no thinge. But I hope to make
this argumente sticke as fast to their
skinne, as the best in the packe.Luk, 24 vers, 39 To our
Sauiour (saieth hee) to proue the veritie

of his body, this argument was forcible▪
but to Maister Robert to proue the
negatiue that Christes bodye is not in
the sacrament it hath no force at all.
And this hee exemplifyeth in his spitefull
maner with A. B. a minister that
preacheth heresie (he might haue taken
William Rainoldes for example, for
except I am deceaued hee was a minister,
or at least a preacher of that, which
nowe hee calleth heresie) of whome it
will follow (saith he) affirmatiuly that he
is an heriticke: but of that hee is no minister,
and preacheth no heresie, it will
not follow that he is no hereticke. But
his simile, if he had anye of that sharpenesse,
with which some slandereth him,
holdeth not. It is common to all humane
bodies to be visible, and palpable
but it is not common to all heritikes to
to be ministers, and preachers. But that
M. Roberts argument holdes both negatiuely
& affirmatiuely, thus I proue.
All negatiues of inseparable accidentes
proues the negatiue of the subiect. But
visibilitie, and palpabilitie are inseparable
accidents of a humane bodie. Ergo,
the negatiue of visibilitie, and palpabilitie,

proues the negatiue of a humane
bodie. This argument, for as weake as it
is, it will passe the cunning of all the Iesuites
in Rome, and Remes to answere
without an instance in the question,
that the naturall bodie of Christe in the
sacrament, is neither visible, nor palpable.
Which assertion is contrarie to
sense, damned bee reason, and without
warrant of the word, except an ambiguous
place which I haue proued the fathers
for 500. yeares to haue taken
figuratiuelye. If any amongst them beleeueth
the fable of Gyges his ringe
which hee there alledges let them beleeue
lyes, that wil. We admitt no such
proofe in maters theologicall.
            After this Maister Robert alledges
the articles of the Beleefe, not as an other
argument, then that of Peter in
the thirde of the Actes, as this wrangler
pretendeth: but as an other testimonye
againste their monstruous presence.
The argumente is the same that before.
That Christ seeing he is in heauen,
is not in the Sacrament. To eleuat
this place, this wrangler alledges Calvines
interpretation of sitting at the

right hand of God: and supposeth Maister
Robert to gather his conclusion
thereupon, that therefore, because hee
hath all power giuen him in heauen, &
earth, he is not in the sacrament. But
this is wrong libelled, hee leaueth out
the tongue of the trumpe, and then
scorneth, because it will not playe. Maister
Roberts argument is, that Christ is
in heauen, at the right hande of his father,
as it is in the beleefe. Ergo he is
not chowed, and champed amongst the
teethe of men in the Sacrament. The
force of the argumente is not from his
sitting, at the right hande of his father:
but from his being in heauen. And there
fore Caluins interpretation of his fitting
at the right hand of his father, is an
vntimely birthe. The same waye he misshapeth
the argument of the Actes but
of that alredie.
            Lastly, hee answereth three places of
Iohn, with an answere, and that (as wee
saye)1
                     •
                  , 28, 
                     •
                  17, 11, 14, 12, 
                     •
                  , 16, hough inoughe. The firste place is
I leaue the worlde and goe to my father. The
second is, I am no more in the worlde. The
thirde is, I goe to my father, and will praye

                     •
                  im to send an other comforter to abide with

you. All this he answereth, that Christ be
the worlde meaneth his conuersation
in the worlde with men, to giue or take
anye bodily helpe, as hee did before his
pa
                  •
               sion. It is true that be the world hee
maye meane that: but that hee meaneth
that onely, is as vntrue. For hee left the
worlde, as hee went to his father: so the
text speaketh plainlye. But hee went to
his father body, and soule. Ergo hee left
the worlde, and as hee speaketh in the
second place, he is no more in the world
bodie and soule. The last place yealdeth
an other argument, which how-be-it he
is answered sufficientlye, yet I can not
omitt. Christ going to his father, did not
that in his humanitie, which hee sent the
other comforter to doe. But hee sent the
other comforter to abide with them for
euer. Ergo Christe in his manhoode
bideth not with them, that is with
his Church for euer 
                  •
                which he most
needes doe if he were daylye receaued
in the Sacrament.
            The 19. cap. he beginneth with a great
contempt of the arguments which he is
to deall with. Calling them Iudaicall,
heritical, & founded vpon manifest lyes

some derogatorie to Christs glorie, and
all without pith or power. The peeuish
ignorance whereof (as hee speaketh in
the former chap.) he imputes to Maister
Robert, as the onelie author of them.
M. Robert is better knowne amongst
them, to whom I write, then that the lauishing
tongue of a railing Romane
priest, whose mouth runnes ouer with ye
venome, of the whoores c
                  •
               ppe, can impaire
an hair-breadth of his name. As
for the arguments, which hee in spyte
calleth peeuish, there is in them more
quicknesse, and sound pith to beare the
conclusion through all the Popes seminaries:
than there is colour of probabilitie
in all Maister Reinolds booke à capite
ad calcem, that is, from the first word
before, to the last word for euer. But to
the purpose.
            The first is. Of an vnseene & vnheard

                  •
               orporall presence, no spirituall effect
can flowe (for that is Maister Rob.
meaning) But the effect of the sacramēt
is spiritual: Ergo the effect of the sacrament
can not flowe from an vnseene, &
vnheard corporall presence. This argument
is in festino in the second figure. so

the maior and the minor this Priest lyke
a Doctour of the Popes divinity makes
no answere. The conclusion he condem
neth of Iudaisme, as making as stronglie
against the incarnation, death, and
passion of our Sauiour. I would rather
there were neither Pope, nor Cardinal
in the world, then that were true. Christ
came in the flesh to doe a bodely work,
not onely a spirituall. To performe the
law, to plant the gospell, to suffer death,
and at a worde, to offer sacrifice after
the order of melchisedech were works
to be performed in our flesh. And so it
was of necessitie that he tooke our flesh
subiect to iniuries, sicknesse, death,
and all the illes that hell, and deathe
coulde inflict. But Christe in the Sacrament
hath no bodelie work to doe: and
therefore needeth no bodie in the Sacrament
to effect the whole worke of
the Sacrament. This argument for as
peuish and pithlesse as it pleased Maister
Rainoldes to call it, let him doe
what hee can will leaue noe roume
in the Sacrament for Christs reall bodie.
            The second is that if the breade and

wine are changed into the bodie, and
bloode of Christe: there remaineth noe
signe of feeding, and nourishing, which
is a thing necessarie to the essence of a
Sacrament. This argument hee calleth
false in euerie pa
                  •
               te, and parcell thereof
and flat repugnante to the firste. And
why for-soothe? because if Christs corporall
presence can not worke a spirituall
effect, what neede we a signe of it?
See the wit of a sophist. Is this the sharpnes
that some commendeth? bee the
cleane contrarie, if he were present bodily
wee neede noe signe of his bodie.
But now that he is absent in bodie, the
signe is giuen vs, to minde vs of his bodie,
and the greate worke of our redemption,
which hee accomplished in
his bodie. And so the deepe contemplation
of that bodie, and that worke,
moued and wakned in vs be grace from
Christ, worketh in our heartes the spirituall
eff
                  •
               ct of that Sacrament. But sait
                  •
               
he, the accidents moueth the senses, and
not the substance, as ordinarie meate
doth nourish, bee meanes of the accidents.
And therefore accidentes are
the signe in the sacrament more properlye

then the substance. And this hee
proueth be the brasen serpent. This is
like the rest of it, his collection is quite
contrarye to his text. The brasen serpent
is a figure of Christe. Ergo accidents
is a figure of Christe without a
subiect. Howe so? is a brasen serpent an
accident? No, but it hath no thing of a
serpent, but the externall figure, which
is an accident. Well libelled Sir William.
Did God ordaine that shape onely,
to be the figure of Christ? The texte
saith, Moses made a serpent of brasse,
and set it vp for a signe: not the shape of
a serpent. And because it hath no thing
of a verie serpent, but an accident, will
it follow that it is no thing but a bare
accident? Be such Logicke ye may well
defende the corporal presence of Christ
in the Sacrament, and a greater absurditie
then that, if a gr
                  •
               sser, and greater
coulde be deuised. But to Maister Robert
his argumente. That which can
not nourish corporrallie, can not
bee a sign
                  •
                of spirituall nourishmente.
But accidentes of breade and wine

                  •
               an not nourishe corporally. Ergo the

                  •
               ccidents of breade and wine, can not

be a signe of spirituall nourishment. To
this hee answereth, that meates doth
nourish bee meanes of accidentes. But
that is doubtfull: and if it were certaine
yet that reason can sounde to no sense,
but such as haue prostituted their reason
to serue Antichrist. Meates doth
nourish be accidentes. Ergo accidentes
doth nourish. If the Pope him selfe or
the fattest Cardinall in Rome were so
fed but fortie dayes, hee woulde counte
accidentes a warish meate. He asketh
Maister Robert where he findeth in all
the euangelistes, or the writtinges of
Paule, that this Sacrament was ordained
to signifie spirituall nuriture, which
(saieth hee) was indeede apoynted to
nourish spirituallie. Heare Maister Robert
asketh him againe, where he readeth
in the whole bodie of the Bible, that
this Sacramente is appoynted in deede
to nourishe spirituallie. As for the firste,
Maister Robert needeth no other
proofe, then the name of a Sacramente.
for the other I doubt me that euer
Maister Rainoldes will

            The thirde is, if their had beene such

a wonderfull thing in the Sacramente,
as they speake of, their woulde haue
beene plaine mention made thereof in
the scriptures. To which hee answereth
that no plainer mention can bee required
then this is my bodye which shall be deliuered
for you. And asketh M. Robert
if he can with al his studie deuise words
more plain
                  •
               , more effectuall, and more
significāt. This is pertly said to it. These
men hath herein a speciall grace. But
not-withstanding if wee get no plainer,
and more manifest proofe, we are very
like neuer to beleeue, that there is any
miracle in the Sacrament. For besides
that, this text is ambiguouse, and capable
of two senses: it hath no mention of
changing the substance, nor that the
body of Christ is invisible, and vnpalpable:
Nor that there remaineth noe
breade, sauing accidents, nor that the
bodye of Christ can at once bee in hea

wordes of our Sauiour the worde (this)
demostrateth the breade. And so the
sense muste bee; This breade is my bodye,

Christ neuer spake. That it cannot demonstrat
their Indiuiduum vagum, or the

But the bodye of Christ in the shape of
breade is not a thing certaine nor subiect
to sense or reason, much lesse their
Indiuiduum vagum. Ergo, the pronoune
(this) can not demonstrate the bodie of
Christ
                  •
               , vnder the shape of bread and
wine, much lesse Indiuiduū vagum, which
it is not possible to english except it

be some wandring vagabond.
            The fifth and laste aboute the place
of August is answered alredie.
            Nowe to Maister Iohn Hammilton
my olde maister. I beganne with him,
and therefore thinke it reason to giue
the reader a taste of his reason. The first
markable thing that I finde in him is,
that since he was made Doctour, hee is
become a worse diuine. He hath written
two bookes. The one printed anno
1581. before his Doctour-shipe
bee intituleth of the Lordes Supper.
And least anye m
                  •
               n should thinke
that he giueth it that name, as from the
subiect, which he laboureth to confute:
he saith in the beginning of it, that of all
the controuerted heades, there is none
of greater importance; 
                  •
               hen that which
concerneth the Sacrament of the altar,
otherwayes called the Lordes Supper.
The words (the Lords Supper) he writteeth
also in the letters;1, Cor, 11, 
                     •
                  0. which he sorted
for the texts of Scripture, and citations
of the ancients remembring belike that
Paull giueth it that name. When you come
together therefore in one place, this is not to

                     ••
                  te the Lords Supper. Deipnon Kyriacon that

is 
                  •
               aules owne wordes. Now he is doctoured
either hee hath forgotten this:
or aduising withsome other Doctour of
greater account then Paull was;Pag, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                in his
last booke hee condemneth both himselfe,
and Paull of heres
                  •
               e: because this
Sacrament was instituted (as hee saith)
after that our Lorde Iesus had supped:
and therefore is an heresie repugnant
to the euangell to call it The Lordes Supper.
He hath an odde argument for him,
to stope euen Paules mouth, if hee were
aliue, to speake one worde for him self,
ab auctori
                     •
                  te negatiue. The fathers called
it not the supper of the Lorde. Ergo it is
rank heresie to call it so. Bee the same
argument no father for 600 yeares after
Christ euer knew or wrote the name of
transubstantiation, nor accidentes with
out subiects, &c. Ergo all these theoremes
of the Romane diuinity are heresies.
But if it were a wonder to see Maister
Iohn Hammilton change behold
                  •
               
a greater wonder then this. There was
nyntene yeare betweene his bookes,
and therefore in nyntene yeares hee
might well change his concept of Paull
who in lesse then nyne-tene monethes

(if wee 
                  •
               re not mis-informed) changed
his opinion of Christe, and of a protestant
became a papist. But this is stranger,
for within nyntene dayes, if the
printer was not verye slowe, hee changeth
also the title of this laste treatise.Pag, 286 At
the beginning condemning the title of
the Lordes Supper for hereticall, and
allowing the title of the Sacramente of
the alter onely for Catholicke, hee beginneth
with that,Pag, 34
                     •
                  
                and for 61. Pages he
keepeth it. At last hee changeth that againe,
and to the ende which containeth
54. pages hee intituleth it of the
Holye communion. A wandring minde is
inconstant in all his wayes.
            But let vs take a vewe of his reasons.Pag, 191
God (saith he) made all thinges with hi
                  •
               
worde. Ergo the wordes of Christ (This
is my bodye) turned the breade into the
bodie of Christe. This saith he the Centurion
confessed.Math, 8, 8,

                And where
hee saieth to his disciples Ye are the salt of
the earth, they were turned into a piller
of salte like Lots wife. And to the pharasies
generation of vipers,
               Mat 12 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                they were turned
into a nest of young vipers. A
                  •
                for
the power of God, & might of his word,
we beleeue with the Centurion, that he
can doe what he will. But that hee will
doe al, that he can, was the faith of the
deuill, who persuaded him to make
breade of stones because he coulde. As
for this question, when Maister Iohn
Hammilton can proue to vs, that Christ
his will was to create him selfe a new
                  •
               
bodie of breade, bee the eternall worde
of truthe, we shall addresse our heartes
to beleeue it.
            Secondlye he argues. It is blasphemy
to saye that Christes blessing worketh
no thing in the breade: and if it worke
anyething, it is no thing but transubstantiation.
To this it maye be replyed,
that Christ hath not left vs in the worde
that powerfull forme of blessing, and
that no other, not the Pope him selfe,

can supplye that want, with wordes

                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . As for the words 
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
thanks, or (to giue him that) blessing
the bread, it containeth onely an assertion
that he blessed it, not the forme how
he blessed it Which thing it may seeme
the Lorde left out, foreseeing that these
men woulde haue misconstrued it, if
they had gotten it. Further they are not
yet agreed on it, whether the wordes of
the institution, or the blessing, if they
had them, worketh this miraculous
change. When they are all agreed let
M. Iohn Hammilton, if hee like not this
answere sende vs word, and wee shall
shape him an other.
            Thirdely he saith, we giue Christ the

into Christes bodie. Be that rule (as is
saide alredie) hee giueth Christe the lye.
that saith he is not a vine, nor a doore.
Alace that M. Iohn Hammilton should
set his faith vpon such grounds as these.
            Fourthlye he woulde proue bee the
institution,Pag, 298 that Christ saide masse in his
owne person: sitting at the table with his
disciples. Masse at a table! 
                  •

w
                  •
               nted an alter hallowed hee some
pope. For seeing it is a necessarie instrument
to that action, it was no harder
for him to haue raised vp a 
                  〈◊〉
                to
that ende; then to turne the bread into
his bodie, nether hauing two bodies,
nor changing the formes of the 
                  •
               reade:
This doubtlesse was a great ouer-sight.
B
                  •
               t heare I woulde aske an other question
also: whether he saide masse sec imdum
ordinem sarum, vel Romanum. And
what was the forme of his masse 
                  •
               loths:
whether in the consecration hee keeped
the iust number of Crosses, beckes,
binges, Ioukes; and turnes prescribed
in that action, whether in his memento
he prayed for his father and his mother,
and in the oblation offered sacrifice for
them. And to omitt the rest, for I can
no
                  •
                stand on all, whether hee repeted
the fiue wordes, hoc est enim corpus meum,
with out taking his breath. For if hee omitted
these murgines, or anye of many
moe then these: he was not so catholike
a preste, I meane so Romane catholike
(and for all my correction pardon
my comparison) as for M. Iohn Hammilton

and ten thousand moe, that is
                  •
               
and was farre more formal, to mummill

                  〈◊〉
                Romane Masse, then hee. Heere also
might be asked, whether the Masse
which Christ saide was perfect, or imperfect.
And if it was perfect as perhaps
they may grant, whether all the crosses,
and kisses in the rubrick of the canon
of the Masse, and the rest of the ceremonies
prescribed there, be vnnecessary
additions: and if they be, what they
were that durste presume to ad to that,
which the eternall wisdome of God had
praescribed such trashe, and make their
inuentiones as necessarie, as his institu
               
                  •
               ion.
For now it is growen to that heade
that if M. Iohn Ham. for as catholike
as he is, or the highest headed Bishope
within the Popes precincts woulde acknowledge
no other Masse, then Christ
ordained,
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   298 he woulde soone be as odious
an heritike, as either Martine Luther,
or Iohn Caluin. But to his syllogisme.
That Christ said Masse thus he reasons.
The Masse is no other thing hut the giuing
and offering of Christes precious
bodie and bloode, contained vnder the
externall formes of breade and wine,

after the order and ri
                  •
               e of melchisade
                  •
               
to theliuing God for the people. But
Christ Iesus after that he had consecrated
the breade and wine in his precious
bodie and bloode, gaue the same to
God the father for his Apostles, sitting
with them at the institution of this holy
Sacrament. Ergo Christe saide Masse at
the institution of the Sacrament. To the

                  
                     〈◊〉
                  
                of this syllogisme I haue answered
that if M. Iohn Hammilton would saye
no other Masse then that, he woulde be
condemned of heresie for imitation of
Christe. The minor I vtterly denye. The
text saieth not that Christe gaue th
                  •
               
breade and wine consecrated to his father
for his disciples: But to his disciples
for a remembrance of his blessed passion.
That which hee gaue to his disciples
for a remembrance of him selfe: it will
passe M. I. his intandement to proue
it giuen to God for them. But to finde
the Masse in these wordes beholde, how
many leapes he takes. Firste that Christ
gaue this Sacrament to his father. Secondly
that (he gaue) is that hee offered.

               I will drinke no more of the fruite of

leauing it indifferent to take

the wine is vnderstoode the bloode of
Christ vnder the shew of wine: or else
that the kingdome of God is the time
of the gospell, in the which we drinke
the verie blood of Christ in the Sacrament.

                  6
               He that easteth my flesh, and drinketh my
bloode, dwelleth in me, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   him. They ar
compelled either to mangle miserably,
or else to denye them, and make the incredilous
to eate the bodie of Christe,
which neither dwelleth in Christe, nor
Christ in them.
            Fourthly the Article of our beleefe,
and the place of the Actes That the heauens
must containe him,
               Actes 32
                     •
                  
                
               vntil the 
                     〈◊〉
                   that
all thinges be restored. They are driuen to
seeke some defense bee hooke, and
crooke, how Christ maye not onely bee
in heauen at the righte hande of his father:
but also in the Sacramente betweene
the handes of a gredie preiste
reddie to eate him vp stoup and roupe.

These foure textes they are compelled
to mangle to maintaine a literall sense
in one. But behoulde more absurditie.
            Firste they will compell vs, vnder
paine of damnation to beleeue that the
bodie of Christ hauing all properties of
a humane bodie sinne onely excepted
is handled and not felt, eaten and not
tasted, looked on and not seene in the
Sacrament.
            Secondlye that the accidentes of
bread, that is, sauour, colour, taste, hardnesse,
moistnosse, &c, are in the Sacrament
without the substance of breade,
where to they are inseparablye anne
                  •
               
               ed.
            Thirdely that these same accidentes
hauing no nature, nor power to feede;
are ordained be Christ to bee the signe
of the spirituall breade that feedeth our
soules to life euerlasting.
            Fourtlye that the substance of the
breade, is changed into the verie reall
and naturall substance of Christs bodie,
that was borne of the Virgine Marye,
and suffered on the crosse for the sinnes
of man.
            Fistly that accidentes doth nonrish,W, R. Cap 19, sect, 1,
               
and feede the bodie, because the substance
doth nourish bee meanes of accidentes.
            Sixtly that the bodie of Christe being
finite, and locall, as it was, when hee
walked on the waters, taught in the
shipe, and died vpon the Crosse, is now
in heauen at the righte hande of his father,
and also on all the altares in the
worlde, in the handes of all the prestes,
in the bellies of all that eateth him, and
in the coffers of al, that will keepe him
in store for an euill daye.
            Seuently that in this mater of transubstantiation
vnder paine of bothe
deathes, that is, temporall and eternall,
we are bound to beleeue nether nature
sense, nor reason.
            And that eightly heerefore how-beit
we see it to mould, rott, and consume,
we must bee persuaded in faith that it is
the immortall bodie of our Lorde and
Sauiour Iesus Christ.
            Nynthly when Aug. or anye other of
the fathers calleth it a figure, wee muste
beleeue that it is bothe the figure of
Christs bodye, and Christes bodye it
selfe.
            
               Tenthly that the partes of Christes
bodie are not distinguished as eie from
eie,Tho Aquinas in 3 quest 76 art 30 hand from hande, heade from foote,
or (with reuerence bee it spoken) taile
from tongue; but all confused together

            Eleuenthly that the preist is the creatore
of his owne creatore,Stella cle
                  
                     •
                  icorum and eateth
him, when he hath created him.
            Twelfthlye that Christe hauing but
one bodie, the people consumeth him
as many bodies in one daye as communicantes
receaueth the Sacramente in
all the worlde.
            Thirtenthlie that the substance of
Christs naturall bodie maye be made of
other substance then the substance of
his mother the virgine Marie.
            My wit can not comprehende the
absurdities of this absurditie. On manye
they are not yet agreed among themselues.
Firste if an oulde wife or anye other
superstitious bodie keepe that sacred
breade for a neede, and chance to
lose it (which may well fall out) Thomas
Aquinas, Alexander de Hales, and
Gerson, holdeth that a mouse, hog, or
doge, if they finde it, and eate it, findeth,

and eateth the verie body of Christ:
Bonauentura and sundry others counteth
it more honest, and reasonable, that
they eate it not. But Peter Lumbard the
grand maister of catholicke conclusiones
leaueth it to God what they eate,
and with all thinkes that it may be saide
that brute beastes eate not the body of
Christ. Some will haue the mouse if shee
can be gotten burnt,Anto

            Secondly in the wordes of the institution
This is my bodye Gerson saith that
the demonstratiue pronoune (this) demonstrateth
the substance of the bread:
Occam saith that it demonstrateth the
bodie of Christ. Thomas Aquinas saieth
that it demonstrateth the thing contained
vnder the forme of the breade.
Hokot saith, that it signifieth a thing

betweene the bodie of Christ, and the
bread, which is nether this nor that, but
common to both. Durand saith, that it
signifieth nothing, but is set materialiter.
After all commeth Steuen Gardinar
Bishope of Winchester and turning
his iudgment (for once hee thought it
might stand very well with demonstration
of the breade) hee saith it demonstrateth
a thing which he calleth Indi

to the capacitie of the simple he calleth
it also Indiuiduum in genere, or Indiuiduum

Which deepe diuinitie I can not expounde
to men that hath noe other but
their mother tongue except Indiuiduum
vagum maye bee some wandring vagabounde.
            In this matter there is much more diversitie
of opinions: which woulde bee
tedious to reckon vppe particularlye.

                and some saith no.
Some saith that the accidents of bread,
& wyne doth nourish: & some saith no.
Some saith that as soone as it commeth

Some saie that Christe is in the Sacrament

that the naturall bodie of Christ is in the

no. Some saith that the substance of the

            Tenthlye whether Gregorie the seuenth
that sweete birde did sinne asking
of it certaine secret matters, and
casting it into the fire, because it would
not answere.
            I coulde here moue many moe questions:
As whether the bodie of Christe
in the wafer cake be formatum, or informe.
If it bee formatum, whether it hath the
forme of a liuing or deade bodie. If of
a liuing bodie, whether it liueth vitam
vigetatiuam, without which sensitiua and
rationalis can not continue vn fed without
a miracle. With manye moe such
strange conclusiones vpon this strange
assertion. But these I will superseede till
I haue gotten a resolute answere to the
former ten out of the vndoubted truthe
of God.
            These strange concequences made
