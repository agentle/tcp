            To the tune of the iouiall Tinker.
            
               
            
            
               THere was a rare Rat-catcher,
               Did about the Country wander,
               The soundest blade of all his trade,
               Or I should him deepely slaunder:
               For still would he cry, a Ratt tat tat, tara rat, euer:
               To catch a Mouse, or to carouse.
               such a Ratter I saw neuer.
            
            
               Upon a Poale he carryed
               Full fourty fulsome Uermine:
               Whose cursed 
                     •
                  ues without any Kniues,
               To take he did determine.
               And still would he cry, a Rat tat tat, tara Rat, euer, &c.
            
            
               His talke was all of India,
               
               The Uoyage and the Nauie:
               What Mise or Rattes, or wild Polcats:
               What Stoates or Weesels haue yee?
               And still would he cry, a Rat, &c.
            
            
               He knew the Nut of India,
               
               That makes the Magpie stagger:
               The Mercuries, and Cantharies,
               
               With Arsnicke, and Roseaker.
               
               And still would he cry, a Rat, &c.
            
            
               Full often with a Negro,
               
               The Iuice of Poppies drunke hee:

               In London he was well knowne:

               That for her, a Baite he layd straight,
               would kill no Rats nor Mice.
               And still would he cry, a Rat, &c.
            
            
               And on the Baite she nibled,
               so pleasing in her taste,
               She lickt so long, that the Poyson strong,
               did make her swell i'th waste.

               He can Collogue with any Rogue,
               and Cant with any Gipsie.
               And still would he cry, a Rat, &c.
            
            
               He was so braue a bowzer,
               that it was doubtfull whether
               He taught the Rats, or the Rats taught him
               to be druncke as Rats, togeather.
               And still would he cry, a Rat, &c.
