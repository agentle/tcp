               BY your patience gentle Reader, giue mee leaue to laie before your eyes, a discourse vpon the Dignitie, or Indignitie of Man, handled in the maner of a Dialogue, by two or three conceited companions: that though they were no great Graduates, yet it seemed by that they spake, they vnderstood what they learned; and though they exceed not in their knowledge, yet they went not to schoo

So would I wish it to be with you that reade, what euer you thinke of my writing, yet so to conceiue of my labour, that being not disdainfully spoken of in this, it may be

better imployed hereafter: but least I should begge a liking of that which may seeme not worth the looking on, I will leaue my wo

               An.
               Truly Sir, I can rather sigh for her, then speake of her, 
                     •
                  or she is so poorely maintained in many places, that shée is called but the Lady of the beggers: and therfore I had rather honor her wher

               Me thinkes peace were a better hearing, and valure is better to be séene in action, then argument: what sayes Meandro?
            
            
               Mean.
               Me thinkes the sound of blood is hideous, and the terror of death is miserable: but shall we rather speake of peace?
            
            
               Dinar.
               I thinke you may holde your peace a good while, before you can truly speake of peace among men, for since the Authour of it went from the earth, I thinke it was neuer séene in the world.

How say you Antonio?
               
            
            
               Anto.
               I thinke that discord hath so got the vpper hand, that peace is so put to silence, that there is almost nothing to be spoken of her, but that it is pittie she is no more to be spoken of.
            
            
               Dinar.
               True: for not only men haue no great pleasure in her, but the women are out of loue with her: and what shall we th

               Not for your liues: make cleane your dishes and your platters, but talke of no Princes matters.
            
            
               Mean.
               Indéed the meane is best, and a quiet is a happie life, obey lawes, paie duties, ware bonds, keepe silence, feare God, and pray for the Quéene: these are all the state matters, that I will either speake of, or harken too.

               Dinar.
               
                  Meandro, thou hast spoken a little to some purpose, it may be thou hast either met with a kind wenche, or an honest friende, that hath brought thée into this good beléefe of all other: but howsoeuer it be, I mislike not what thou hast saide, what euer it be that thou thinkst: but to answere ye both, let me tell yée, that yée are both short of that you woulde seeme to speake of, which is the worthinesse, or vnworthinesse of man: which neyther lyeth in your praise, nor his disgrace, but in that which either aboue, or belowe your reaches is to be considered: yée haue béene like two Fishers that came to a Brooke where were good Fish, but they laie at the bottome, which though no deeper then they might wade, yet they loathd to take too much paines, caught a fewe Engines in the shallowe grauell, and thought themselues no meane Fisher-men: you haue studied some point of Philosophy, and obserued much of that you haue séene, but Aristotle must giue place to Plato, and you may learne more if you will take paines: and for that I will not be so vngratefull, as to say nothing touching your opinions, I will deliuer yée a little of what I haue redde, and gathered fully: by my reading, touching this poynt of the Dignitie, or Indignitie of
man.
               First, touching his 
                     •…
                  st substance, it was neither of slime; nor Creame, as either of you haue imagined, but of a secret instinct of loue, which would haue an Image lyke vnto it self, when the omnipotencie of the Deitie beganne a worke of great Maiestie: when in the seconde person of himselfe hée shewed the perfection of that forme. Learne then to knowe, that before all beginnings there was a beginning, which being without beginning in it selfe, beganne all beginnings by it selfe, and willing to be pleased in it selfe, beganne this first Image to it selfe: so that héereby ye may sée in this beginner of all beginnings, was loue the first beginner of this worke, which we call man, who hauing all things before it selfe to looke vppon, made loue the only first substance to worke vppon, which laide vppon this slyme or Creame as yée haue termed it, brought it to that forme which it selfe lyked: and (as it is) then first named it, man.
               Here now was the first and only best part of his honour, that the creature was made vnto the Image of his Creator. I speake not of that outward forme, wherein we behold him, but in that inward perfection wherin his glory created him. Now to his second honour, hée placed him in Paradise, where hée made him kéeper of his garden, with possession of all his fruits, one only excepted. The third honour, he gaue him power and commaundement ouer all his earthly creatures, and to name them at his owne pleasure. The fourth honour was his wife, that he tooke out of his owne side, that he might be matched, but with himselfe, nor with any meaner creature then himselfe. These are the foure first proofes of the dignitie and honour of man, in his first perfection: his creation to the Image of his Creator, his keeping of Paradise, his commaund ouer all other earthly creatures, and his companion but a part of himselfe. Now to enter into further parts of honour bestowed vpon them, the wisedome of the Prophets, the myracles done by them, the valour of the Kinges, the victories gotte by them, the blessinges of the faithfull, the true memorie of them, his loue of his beloued, the death of his onely Sonne Jesus Christ for them, the messages of his Angeles, to the seruaunts of his loue,

the Incarnation of Eternitie, in the wombe of virginitie, the inspiration of the Apostles, the patience of the Martyrs, and the

What Lyon so stout, but Sampson could tame him? and what Gyant so great, but little Dauid could conquere him? and what Whale so rauenous, but Ionas could get out of him? what daunger so great, but Iosuah would attempt it? and what misery such, but Iacobs patience did endure it?
               Now leauing to speake of those a
                     •
                  ncient examples, let vs come into these dayes to beholde the myraculous workes of God in the heart of man, in the gouernment of kingdomes, in warre, and in peace, the rare Art in gorgious buildings, the running hand in planting of fruites, the excellent skill, in the fortifying of countries, the daintie Art of the Needle in workes of all colours, the excellent Harmony in the Art of Musique: In summe, all the excellencies that can bee imagined, as well by Sea, in the Shipwright and Sayler, as by Lande in the Souldier, and Miner, and the Scholler as well in knowledge, as vtterance: Are not all these excellencies, with all the morrall vertues, onely propper vnto man? and last of all his acknowledging of his God, to whome hee is onely bounde for all his goodnesse?

What shall I néed to runne into a world of questions in this point, is not the vertuous a kinde of God, and the vicious a kinde of diuell in the world? Consider therefore, since only in God is that originall of Vertue, whereby man only is made vertuous, and by that Vertue so gracious, as maketh him the most honourable of all creatures, and in the diuell is that originall of sinne, whereby man is made vicious, and by his vices so disgracious, as maketh him the most dishonourable of all creatures.
