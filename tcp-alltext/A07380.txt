               Alſo there was ſeen ouer the towns Saint Thomas, Ard, Aras, and Callice in the aire, foure horſemen in blacke armour, and black lances following one another with mightie haſte, running toward the Weſt, as it were againſt the Sunne: But at laſt the ſunne angry it ſeemed with their menaces, grewe blacke, and ſodainly cauſed fearefull lightning and thunder, the clowds opening and ſhutting very fearefully: Inſomuch they thought it had been doomes day. And thus they continued for three houres togither, and after that there was found bloud in the high way to Betuna, which thoſe of the towne affirmed to raine from heauen. Inſomuch that ſome of the ſouldiers of the towne being in the fieldes playing at hand-ball one Si

               on hauing deuided themſelues into companies appointed to meete at this village, called Mecare vnderſtanding that thoſe ſouldiers had paſſed the riuer of Some ſome ten dayes before, and got ſpoiles in the marſhall Berons, and count ſaint Pauls quarters, and therfore they vowed in this ſaly of free boot to reuenge themſelues at full, & ſo they did: for in the night they came and fired the village and ſeaſed on all they could find worth the carriage for their lawfull purchaſe; by occaſion of which fire, many were forſt to leape from windows, and falling, brake their legs, neckes and armes, which the countie of ſaint Pauls ſouldiers ſeeing departed, thinking themſelues ſufficiently reuenged.
            
            
               Alſo the very ſame night thoſe of the townes Ard, Aras, Saint Thoma
                  •
               , and Callice, did ſee in the aire an angell with a crown on his head, and a ſworde in one of his handes, which twiſe or thriſe appeared like a ſword of fire, ſtill remoouing vp and down
               
the aire, ſomtime ouer one of the townes, ſometime ouer another. And in the aire was heard a fearefull noiſe for the ſpace of an houre togither: and after the noiſe as certaine marchants affirme the Angell was heard to weep very greeuouſly in the aire, and was ſeene to ſpreade his arme towardes the Weaſt, ſpreading his hand, as warning them to beware leſt the ſword of gods wrath fell amongſt them.
            Now after theſe feareful ſights in the aire, there roſe a great miſt, which gaue ſuch a ſtincking ſmell, that the people of Ard were forſt to ſhut their doores and windowes, that before ſtoode to behold theſe ſights in the aire, and their cattell not able to ſee where they were, or not able to abide the ſmell of the graſſe, while this fog continued, made haſte to come home to their ſtals along the dikes, as they were woont, and not ſeeing where they were, fell into diches and riuers by the way and were drowned, which cauſed great ſorrow to the towneſmen, and drewe them almoſt into deſpaire by this ſodain tokē of his heauy diſpleaſure.
            Alſo there was ſeen in the aire after this fearefull and noiſom foggy miſt, a bloudy croſſe which ſtoode iuſt in the ſame quarter w

And certaine it is, that ſince this fearefull ſight many fearing Gods iuſt iudgement on them for their carrying armes in vniuſt wars, haue ſince left their companies & are now ioyned with the king of Fraunce: and it is thought, which I pray God may proue ſo that more will follow: for thoſe of our poore countrey of Flaunders, as Anwarpe, Bruſel

plagues ſhewed on him, ſuffer the poore oppreſſed to depart: but this Pharao of Spaine notwithſtanding Gods many fearefull examples ſhewed, will not ſuffer our poore oppreſſed Belgians to liue in peace, but ſtill laies more taſkes and paiable duties to the maintaining of his vniuſt wars then Pharao did on the children of Iſrael: for both their goods, wiues, maids, and liues are at the Spaniards command, or at leaſtwiſe control, god yet in mercy mooue the heart of ſome man to be a Moſes to my countrey men, and either by miracles or by the ſworde releaſe them, their wiues, and children from the handes of thoſe wicked and bloudy minded Spaniardes: for their ſhoulders are almoſt broken with bearing the yoke of his oppreſſion. God for his mercy ſake when it pleaſeth him, releaſe them. Meane ſpace, being as I thanke God I am, free from his tyranny, I will (as I am bound daily) pray for the reſt of my countreymen, that God may giue them patience and true faith in Ieſus Chriſt, til it pleaſe him to releaſe them.
            Thus much I thought good to aduertiſe you according to my laſt promiſe, when we parted at Quient: and in any thing you haue occaſion to vſe me in theſe partes, I pray command me in part requitall of your many fauours: for abſence cannot make me forget my friends, and ſo farewell in God.

            True newes out of Worceſterſhire.
            
               AMongſt the many of Gods fearefull myracles, ſhewed on vs here in England, as ſliding of grounds, remoouing of highwaies, mightie floudes by great abundance of raine, fearefull lightnings and thunders, great fire from heauen, ſodaine earthquakes, ſtrange and deformed children borne, great dearth of corne, mighty plagues and peſtilence, death of many good and godly benefactors, as the late lord Maior for inſtance, much ſtrife in the church by ſectes and ſchiſmes, with fearefull threatnings of the foe of Spaine in his attempts of inuaſion, amongeſt (I ſay) all theſe fearefull warnings ſent vs by God to draw vs to amendment of life, and

to ceaſe from our former wickedneſſe, wherein how wiſſully we tranſgreſſe, let euery one examine their conſcience, and then no doubt but God will ſend the remorce of thoſe conſciences, to draw vs to a newneſſe of life, leſt like Ieruſalem, Sodome and Gomorrha, and many other countries yet freſh in memorie, we feele Gods iudgement when we would repent and amend: if we might ſind time amongſt al theſe tokens of Gods kindled anger beholde one token more, which might mooue vs vpon the knees of our hearts to aſke God forgiueneſſe for our ſinnes, though he had neuer ſent vs other token to affright vs, or mooue vs to remember our ſwearing, drunkenneſſe, whoredome, couetouſnes, and rapes, and murders and ſuch like. For now behold the Lord hath ſent vs no example of nine dayes woonder, as the wicked account all tokens whatſoeuer, but he hath ſent vs a heauy example, an example of affliction, a grieuous and almoſt incredible diſeaſe of ſodaine lameneſſe, beginning, not at the hart nor head, but at the verie toe of the foote, and can by no meanes be cured, for from the toe it goes into the foote, from thence into the leg, and ſo vpwards ſtill, and ſtill as it aſcends higher, the place it leaueth, dieth, and if it once get to the thigh, then no way but death for the party infected, for there is no meanes to cure it but cutting off the legs and armes. Whereſoeuer it beginneth, it begins like a tingling, or paine like the gowt, and in foure and twentie houres it wil grow red, and in ſixe houres after, it will be as blacke as a ſhooe, and be ſtone dead, and dies alwaies vpwards, either in the legs or armes, inſomuch that ſome haue loſt both their legs, others both their armes, being cut off, and yet are liuing, a heauy conſideration, which the vngodly regard not.
            For proofe of what I ſay, becauſe many are incredulous, ther is a man in Weſtminſter named Hugh Alee, whoſe ſonne Edward Alee was taken with the ſame diſeaſe, whoſe legge being cut off at the knee was found ſo dead, that th
                  •
               re came not aboue two drops of bloud from it, and the diſeaſe is ſo ſtinking, that the ſurgeons are faine to fold mufflers three double about their noſes and mouthes, when they come to dreſſe them. And al this diſeaſe onely raignes within tenne miles of Worceſter round about euery way, and in Worceſter it ſelfe, ſo that there are at this day aboue a hundred infected, and almoſt halfe as many are dead already of it, and ſome that looke to it in time, eſcape: it

ſpareth neither men nor women, inſomuch that manie do leaue to ride that way fearing the diſeaſe, whereby the poore countrey is like to be vndone, except that by the praiers of the faithful and godly the Lord be moued to ſtay his hands. But yet it ſeemeth that he doth not only ſhew vs wonders, but hath likewiſe aſſigned manie men to be hard harted and incredulous of Gods wonders, the proofe was ſeene in a man of Worceſter, who heareing of this ſtrange diſeaſe, ſaid he did not beleue that there could be ſuch a ſodaine diſeaſe: which one hearing, rebuked him, but notwithſtanding he continued in his obſtinat miſdoubt, til a ſurgeon carried him from houſe to houſe of the infected, and ſhewed him, in ſome places legs cut off, and in other places armes, and in many places men dead by this diſeaſe: which he ſeeing, as diſpairing, in that he had beene ſo doubtfull, went home vnto his houſe, and in very angui
                  ••
                died, rauing & crying for Gods mercy, which many men may take for example, that doe diſtruſt in the omnipotent power of God, thinking their weake iudgement can comprehend Gods many threatning examples. But why do we wonder at his miſbeleefe, when almoſt in euery place men are miſbeleuing & diſpairing, & are giuen to violent ſlaughters? For proofe of which, a man about S. Katherines was found ſo wilful in his own wicked opinion, that he drowned himſelf, hanging a great weight of lead about his necke, thinking by that meanes neuer to haue bin found: but yet for al his wilful act god caſt him aland, only to ſhew vs that he wil not that man ſhal (relying on his own policy) hide any thing from God, for he ſearcheth the reines & hart, & knows the very thoughts of al men how iuſt or vniuſt ſoeuer. But for al this we are careleſſe of his heauy plagues and feareful examples, til either in diſpaire or wilfulnes we feele his puniſhments: for now in this age men are only ſtudying howe to liue and carrie credite in this worlde, thorough worldly riches, which howſoeuer it be gotten they regarde not, be it by murther, oppreſſion, periury, ſlander & vſury: the proofe whereof appeared in a man dwelling in Kent, who went about to build a faire houſe, telling a friend of his hee meant to let it w
                  •
               ll when it was finiſhed, & ſaid likewiſe, that he would let it to the poore, not to the rich, making euery chamber a tenement, and then he knew the poore wil take it at ſuch a rate, that of x. pound a yere, if it were all in one, he would make forty almoſt, being

thus in tenemēts diuided, & in this determination went forward with his building til it was halfe finiſhed. But ſee how God ſhewed his iudgement vpon him, bicauſe he meant to extort vpon ye poore: for when he had builded halfe the houſe, his mony grew ſo ſhort that he could proceed no further, whereat many in the country made a great mocking, which at laſt came to his care, in ſo much that going thorow the ſtreets of the towne, many would vnderlook him & ſay, Is this he that wil build houſes to begger the poore? but he lacks mony: Mary ſayes one, and Ile lend him a peny: wherfore anſwers another? mary to buy a rope to hang him in for his good mind. Thus many times he was mockt, til at laſt mooued with bitter anguiſh, and deepely vext in mind, he went greeuing that any ſhould ſee his face any more, and in that houſe which he was building went & hanged himſelfe. And this may ſerue for a warning to many Landlords in theſe daies that do not build houſes as minding thereby to let them the better cheap, but rather to raiſe the rents, to the vtter vndoing of a common wealth, & only impoueriſhing to the poore of England, for many nowadaies take in as much ground as to make a hog fly, and when their hog is dead, then they boord the ſtie, and that a poore man and his wife muſt pay viii. d. or xii. d. a week, hauing neither chimny nor chamber, ſuch a one, as when 2 or 3 are ſet togither by a fire made vpon the ground for want of a harth, thē (I ſay) the houſe is ſo ful that the dog muſt ſtand at the doore, as hauing no rowme in the houſe: which is a lamentable caſe, if it were lookt into, and no doubt makes a great many beggers in a yere, & is beſides a couer of much miſchiefe: for whatſoeuer they be, or howſoeuer they liue, if they pay them their mony wel, they regard not. And in theſe places adulterets, theeues, conſoliers, and ſuch like are daily harboured, which I pray God wiſe magiſtrates may looke into, that it proue not a iuſt plague to this country of England, and bring not remedileſſe hurts to this bleſſed commonwealth, which God in his great mercy defend vs from, and open our eyes to ſee his diſpleaſure kindled againſt vs, and euery man to repent him of his former wicked life, that wee may all with Abraham and the bleſſed ones liue in ioy with Chriſt euerlaſtingly.
            Amen.
