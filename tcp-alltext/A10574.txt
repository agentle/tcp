                  Ibidem vz. 14. &. 15. Col. 3.
               ) he yet dealt ſo mercifully by the Miniſtery of his cherubins theſe Angels with them, that he reſerued them by repentaunce to returne into his kingdome by the redemption of his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus and through the regeneration of his holy ſpirite. Great cauſe haue we therfore the remnant of their poſterity in theſe late dangerous dayes, not onely to be ware by their harmes, but alſo carefully to indeuour our ſelues according to his holy word.

making of the tabernacle: That the Cherubins ſhould ſtretch their vvinges on hye, couering the mercie ſeate vvith their vvinges, ſo as their faces being one tovvardes another,

               ſhould alſo bee tovvardes the mercie ſeate: And againe, that from the mercie ſeate, betvveene the tvvo Cherubins, hee vvould tell them all thinges vvhat he vvould haue giuen in commaundement vnto the children of Iſraell: Euen ſo it would pleaſe him of his gracious goodnes, to bee mercifull vnto his choſen Church diſperſed throughout the world, in the building of his ſonne Chriſt & his Goſpell, with the ſauegarding of his holy Angels: And that by his ſpeciall grace he would be in the mideſt of his elect, to inſtruct them in his will that they may warely & worthely walke in the ſame. For, the Miniſters cannot build Ieruſalem before god laye the firſt ſtone: That is, Chriſt,

               eing that Moyſes, ſayeth in Geneſys. 1.

               
               
               
               
in the beginning of Geneſis, mencion is made of this battaile, and moſt greuous conflict, betwene the ſonne of God, and theſe deuils: where wee reade thus, That the ſeed of the Woman ſhall breke in ſunder the Serpents head.
                  Geneſ 3. And that the ſerpent burning with infinite luſt of reuenge, by endleſſe and vnſaciable hatred in al that he can, ſhal with excéeding beaſtly rage & cruelty perſecute the ſame ſeede.
            But, that Angels by theyr owne wyll and luſte became diſobedient,
                  Angels degenerate.
                and haue loſt theyr brightneſſe and ſincertie: The Epiſtle of S. Iude witneſſeth, where hee clearely and profoundly ſayth. The Angels obſerued not their Originall: That is to ſaye,
                  Iude. 1. they were in the beginning made pure and vndefiled, but afterwards they became diſobedient like as S. Peter, ſayth.2. Pet. 2. 
               They tranſgreſſed, and therefore were they plagued. And Chriſt ſaith, that the Deuill continewed not in truth:
               
                  Iohn. 8. ſignifying by the wordes: Hee was indeede created in truth, but hee aboade not in the truth, but fell from the truth, and periſhed. And in an other place hee ſayeth. That the deuil ſpeakes lies of his owne.
               
That is, hee ſpeaketh lyes of that,
                  Ibidem.
                which hée receiued not from God, but what hee of his owne will, liberty and luſte tooke & choſe vnto himſelfe, this is ſinne. This doctrine is néedefull to bée knowen, and to know this, maketh much for our purpoſe, leaſt wée doo fall into that filthy heriſie of the Manichees, and that wée may be fortified againſt the ſame: And this doctryne did theſe auncient Fathers of ſound iudgment diligentlye teach, and beate into mens eares. Contrarie wiſe, good Angels béeing corroborate or ſtrēgthened by the ſonne of God, through hys holy ſpirite continued ſtill in obedyence & were confirmed, that ſo the ſon of God might continue and abide there lord and head.
            Thirdlye alſo the Miniſterye of good Angels and theyr office,
                  Miniſterie of good Angels and of euill.
                let vs ſée out of the worde of God. And firſt héere euen thys is ſpeciallye neceſſary, that we may learne ſuffcientlye to knowe the will and practyſes of the euyll ſpyrit agaynſt vs.
            Of ye 
               Hebrues, Sathan is called that euil Spirit, (yt is to ſay.) The aduerſary. For al deuils be perpetual dedly vnreclaimable

                  
                  
                  
                  
vnto him. For ſo is hee made, that he feareth no man.
            
            A man may ſee a certaine image of Sathā in the Turkes, which are ye moſt deereſt and moſt diligenteſt veſſels and inſtrumentes of Sathan to the accompliſhment of all his will,
                  The Turke a right image of Sathan.
                luſt, and deſires. In theſe may you haue a certayn image not obſcure, of that malicious & moſt cruell ſplrit, to beholde, with ſuch outrage of minde, with ſo great bitterneſſe of crueltye are the Turkes enflamed againſte Chriſtians: with ſo deadly and beaſtlye cruell hatred, are they ſwolne againſt them, that they aduenture and ſuffer at full, all manner of gréefes, miſeries, and calamities, hunger, thirſt, moſt gréeuous labours, ſcourges, ſtripes, woundes, yea and alſo death it ſelfe: So that they may hurt and worke extreame iniurye towardes the bodyes and goods of Chriſtes true beléeuers. And where they preuaile in ſtrength, hauing obtained ſome one victorie ouer the Chriſtians, they are not contented with the ritches and ſubſtaunce, nor wyth the obedyence and ſeruilitye of Chriſtians, but wyth beaſtlye, and horryble crueltye

they kill and ſlaie as well young as olde, men and womē, with the ſword ripping the bellyes of women great with childe, they hange vp babes and ſilly infantes vppon hedges or ſtakes, they diſmember and butcherly mangle in péeces their captiues with their hooked and bowed fawchins, none other wiſe then Butchers doo Oxen: Neither are they touched with any neuer ſo ſclender motion, of mercye towardes them or their ſo great calamitye: That I may in meane time let paſſe with ſilence theyr miſchéeuous filthy dealinges, bothe horrible to héere, and to repeate, as alſo theyr abhominable ſinnes ſhameleſſe crimes and reproches wherewith they punniſh & torment thoſe ſilly Chriſtians, whome they haue captiued.
            Wée can not ſée Sathan,
                  Sathan vnuiſible in ſubſtaunce.
                in his ſubſtaunce, becauſe hée is a ſpirit, as Paule ſayth Epheſ. 2. And againe in the 6. Cha. thus: We fight not againſt blod & fleſh: But Sathans moſt malicious & murdering will, cogitations, hatred, craftie dealings practiſes & councels againſt vs, after a ſort wee may know & ſee in his members That is, in vngodly perſons, who be voide of ye feare of God & indued

               
               
               
               
are with what force of body and minde, and with what ſtrength hée is indued: what weapons or defences hee will vſe, what are his determinations, what thinges he practiſeth, and with what pollicies & ſubtilties he is inſtructed. Theſe when thou haſt diligentlie ſearched out, then much better furniſhed, and much more boldlie maieſt thou marche on to ſet vpon him, thereby more buſilie maiſt thou defend thy ſelfe, ſo much more circumſpectlie maieſt thou inuade him, and thereby more aſſured, and more greater hope maieſt thou haue to obtaine the victorie, and beare the prize away. And that ſame our heauenlie Father hath opened and diſcloſed vnto vs his childrē, by good credit in his worde, all this enimies thoughts, determinations, practiſes, enterpriſes, will, power, and warlike proviſion of this our horible and mightie enimie: to the ende that we may well and ſtronglie defend our ſelues againſt hys violence, practiſe and ſnares: to the ende wée might goe againſt him, eaſilie abide ye brunt of his aſſault, & be able to quēch and vanquiſh all his firie dartes. If ſo be that wée at no time through great and

filthie ingratitude and fooliſhnes deſpiſe and reiect the doctrine of God, and his admonitions: nor as faithleſſe vngratious, vngodly, trucebreakers, forſworne, fearefull and fainthearted ſouldiors caſting away our weapons, diſpairing in minde, without any reſiſting (which the moſt mercifull God turne from vs) yéeld our ſelues into perpetuall and wretched ſeruitude, nor deliuer ouer our ſelues vnto ſo filthy, ſo horrible and ſo beaſtly cruell enemie.
            Therefore nowe hearken ye and giue eare,
                  After vvhat maner Sathan inuadeth mankinde.
                how that changeling our moſt diligent and moſt craftie deceitfull enemye inuadeth and tempteth mankinde, with what ſubtill ſleightes he ruſheth in vppon vs, with what bandes of power hée fighteth againſt vs, with what garboiles he beſturres him, and what ſubtilties and fraudes he vſeth to circumuent vs. He is not ignorant that we ſhalbe made partakers of eternall righteouſnes and ſaluation, and that we ſhall attaine thether from whence his vile corruption fell, if we doe conſtantly & by al meanes ſticke to the trueth of the Goſpell, embracing the ſame with both armes, and

               
               
               
               
the wordes of God, preferring his lyes before them, inducing them againſt the worde of God, and diſanulling the words of God, preferred he his craftie lyes in place of them. This falſe tale was the beginning, the well ſpring the roote and cauſe of all our miſerie and calamitie. This moſt filthie and deadlye did Sathan notably decke with collours and ſet to ſale for his aduauntage: when he ſaide It ſhould come ſo to paſſe▪ if they did eate of that tree,
               
                  Geneſ. 3. 
               that they ſhould knowe both good and euill, and that they ſhould be euen as Gods. Héere the policie and practiſes of that old Serpent fell out euen as he himſelfe wiſhed them,
                  Sathans firſt victory ouer mankinde.
                whereby he purpoſed to caſt mankinde headlong into the ſame diſobedience, (whereunto he himſelfe was fallen down) that they ſhould not continue in the truth. This was the firſt victory of this our enimie ouer vs: which hée obtained, not by any good or iuſt means, but onely by meere murthering falſhood and treacheries. By this victorie gotten ouer vs alſo he ſo held vs altogether and euerie one of vs drawen, enthralled bound and made his owne bondſlaue,

yea he ſo chained vs together & brought vs into that bondage, that not one of vs in deede could eſcape or ſtart from him: had not afterwards ye truth, wiſedome & power of God himſelfe that is to ſay,

                the onely begotten and naturall ſonne of God bin made man to the end he might encounter in a wonderfull battell with that moſt craftie Serpent: and foile him with his owne weapons, yea ouerthrow and vtterly vanquiſhed him: ſo that not onely by fine force and power, but alſo by good right, he aſſailed with ſtrong hand hereby to deliuer al mākind out of Sathans power and iuriſdiction.
            If then at the beginning his lyings, deadly practiſes, and miſchéeuous enterpriſes againſt mankind (of all creatures ſo perfectly framed) ſo wiſhfullie and ſo notably by and by came to paſſe as hée would haue it,
                  Sathans ſubtil deceites. As he is a ſoule ſlaier.
                that he could caſt down our firſt parentes into this farre moſt wretched, moſt gréeuous moſt ſorowful and moſt horrible calamitie of all other: when as yet they were frée from ſinne, when they were of firme, and vpright of liuely and floriſhing, of ſound and vndefiled conuerſation: If (I ſay) he could

               
               
               
               
ſeduced, corrupted and beſotted mankinde with ſo horrible ſo manifolde falſhoodes, deuiliſh deceites and errours, (as Moſes witneſſeth in the 6. of Gene.) that, All the earth was wicked and corrupt in the ſight of God, and was filled with iniquitie: And al fleſh vpon earth had corrupted their former waies wherin they were preſcribed of God to continue, So, that God (in reſpect of his Iuſtice) coulde no longer ſuffer that huge, farre ſpred and infinite mallis of Sathan, & that abūdance of wickednes & ſinnes ſo raging▪ But therfore deſtroied he with an vniuerſall deluge all that firſt age of the world, ſauing viii. perſons onelie. And when that Noah & his ofſpring or kinred in ye ſame new world begā a freſh to be planted and ſomewhat to increaſe, by and by Sathan againe brocheth and practiſeth his ſubtil ſleights, when there were a feaw perſons, and as it were deſolate ſoiourneis which truely feared & knew God,
                  Geneſ. 7. as Noah & his kinſfolke did. Then filleth hee the earth with Idolatries and all kinde of errours brought in by his falſe and vngodly doctrines.
            But, God (not vnmindefull of his

mercie) choſe vnto him againe a certaine man and his ſéede, namely Abraham:
               
                  The mercy of god in ſtirring vp Abraham.
                with whome the truth of Gods woorde was founde. And yet notwithſtanding there was an Innumerable multitude of Gentils vppon earth voyde of all knoweldge of God.
                  Geneſ. 12. In Iſraell doubtleſſe the name of God was onelie knowen, there the knowledge of him floriſhed: The nations (as Paule witneſſeth) in the worlde not truſting in God:
               
                  Rom. 1. 
               But were without all knowledge of him. And I pray you what a handfull and a very little portion of people were the Iewes in reſpect of the Gentils? But what other thing did the Gentils being enthralled and ſeduced with the illuſions and diueliſhe deceites of Sathan, then that they ſerued him and worſhipped him, with diuers & infinite manifolde Idolatries? Did hée not with ſo horrible and deteſtable blindeneſſe béeſotte infatuate and bewitch them that they adored and worſhiped, Cats Dogges Curlewes, alſo other filthie and vile liuing Creatures, as Serpentes and Crocodiles, by the teſtimonie of manie and diuers Hiſtories?

               
               
               
               
of their errours amongſt them, they might infect & corrupt others with their maladie.
            
               
                  Of this mā came the ſect of Nicholataines
               Such one was Nicholas one of the ſeuen Deacons in the Citie of Antioche the enemie of Chaſt Matrimonie. Actes▪
                6. But in very déede not long after and whyles certaine of the Apoſtles were yet liuing, hee began by his falſe Apoſtles to preach lyes, and to ſowe abroade his horrible errours, moſt vngodly opinions, and moſt falſe doctrines: namely, 
               That there is no reſurrection of the fleſh 
                Again, That righteouſnes or ſaluatiō before God, cōmeth by the worke of the Law.  Thirdly, That Chriſt is not a true God, but mā only. But when ye Apoſtles of Chriſt had ſlept in the Lorde, and that lying & falſe forſworne Spirit thought he had a time giuen him in the world▪ to ſowe his leaſings and lyes (when, the Apoſtles were gone to God) then and not before (like as wee may ſée the ſame in Egeſippus) began hee to turmoyle himſelf and ſtirre vp diſcordes in ye Church, by his lyings, by his corrupting ye ſcriptures, and eftſoones planting and bringing

in Hereſies againſt the Creation, againſt the diuinitie and humanitie of Chriſt, alſo fayning a certaine corporall kingdome of Chriſt vppon earth▪ before the latter day,
                  Diuers Heriſies.
                wherein wee ſhoulde abound with, and inioy all kinde of moſt exquiſite pleaſures: which was the opinion of Cerinthus the Heretike,
                  Cerinthus.
                lyke as Euſebius himſelfe witneſſeth in his 3. booke. There were diuers hereſies againſt Chriſt: This Heretike was not perſwaded that the naturall man was God. Another beleeued not that God was natural man. And heare good Lord, howe much calamitie and what horrible errours brought he in, howe many blaſphemies belched hee ought againſt Chriſt, by the Montaniſts,

This Pelagius was a Moncke, and left behind him a filthy and noyſome ſtincke, of whome thoſe begging Monckes firſt began their order. How then? Did he not I pray you eſtabliſh in the Popedome horrible and

               
               
               
               
Sathans workemanſhip, with all hys power, of whome Paule wryteth vnto the Theſſalonians. 2. Epiſtle. 2. Chap.
            
            I pray you what troubles and calamities hath not the ſame ſpirit of lying and murder, ſtirred in this our ſo greatly vnquiet time in the country of Weſtphalia Munſteri.
            
               
                  What ſubtil ſleightes Sathan did vvorke in Weſtphalia.
               Beleeue mee hée is a wonderfull and notable craftes maiſter in deceiuing the worlde, he is moſt abſolutely furniſhed with all kynde of ſubtill ſleight, deceipts and miſchéefes to beguile vs, and euen to worke wonders is hée taught and exerciſed in this wreſtling place: where he findeth auditories & ſchollers docible & tractable. Whom by and by he ſo be ſotteth and blindeth their mindes, that of ſome errours hee breedeth moe: was it not a moſt great and horrible, bewitching dementation or dooting, and blinding of theyr ſences, when as incontinently the cittizens of Munſter were driuen awaye from the ſymplicitye of Gods woorde, touchyng the Sacramentes, by wonderfull and ſubtyll ſleyghtes iuglynges and deceiptes?

when it caried thoſe whome it would, and caſt downe headlonge ſuch perſons eftſons out of moſte greeuous errours, into more greeuous, more heinous and more horrible errour.
            Firſt,
                  The errors of the Munſterians.
                Sathan beſotted them with this error, yt they baptiſed children twice, & ſo moſt gréeuouſly diſhonored this honorable Sacrament. This was the firſt ſtep vnto theyr diſtructtion. After that with a certaine incredible and moſt fained hipocriſie did he blind them, ſo that the moſt godly and moſt honeſt perſon was reputed for a moſt wicked and moſt lewdeſt of others, except he would baptiſe children twiſe. The hearts alſo of certaine perſons hée ſo bewitched and blinded, that they thought themſelues to be, very Prophets. When as therefore hée had called and drawen them away, from the woorde of God, vnto thoſe theyr dreames, hée might for certainty promiſe himſelfe the conqueſt ouer them nay hée had all ready conquered them. And indéede thus far had that wolfe leared and lurked, béeing clad in a ſhéepes ſkinne, boaſting himſelfe to be a ſheepe: But when thoſe errours which hee had

               
               
               
               
were not theſe horrible thinges? is not Sathan here a merueilous, a guileful inſnarer, a notable craftes maiſter in lies? That by his illucions caſteth mankind into ſo great troubles,
                  Sathan holdeth Papiſts faſt bound in errors.
                and ſo great calamities? Dooth hee not alſo dayly in moſt horrible manner make blynde our aduerſaries the moſt cruel and moſt ſpight full Papiſts? Dooth he not amongſt them norriſh & cōfirme horrible blaſphemies againſt god? Dooth he not mightily hold faſt and beeſot them with his errours, that they can not by any meanes abide to heare the true and ſinceare goſpell, and that they had rather héere the moſt vile, moſt filthy and moſt fabulus toies, then the ſcriptures of God? And yet they ſuffer whoredomes and other luſtes and miſchéefes to eſcape vnpuniſhed: But in the meane tyme ſuch as beleeue the goſpell▪ and endeuour to direct theyr lyfe after the rule & preſcription thereof, thoſe do they extremely perſecut, hate, perſue, teare in péeces with reproches & ſclaunders, yea ſpoile them of theyr ſubſtance and with deuiſed torments do they vexe them. Is not this a worke of the deuill and a blindneſſe of him that the moſt

manifeſt & cleare ſcriptures are ſet before the Papiſtes and by all meanes ſo expounded,
                  No truth can make them yeeld.
                euen as the true Catholique Doctors and Chriſtians haue vnderſtood the ſame from the beginning, that they are compelled to confeſſe it to bee the woorde of God: And yet Sathan holdes them ſo Captiued and bounde in the chaines of mannes tradicions, that they are not afraied fréelye and openlye to ſaye, that they can not imbrace that doctrine of God, except fyrſt the Pope and his Biſhoppes doe like thereof and alowe the ſame. As if we laye againſt them, both kindes of the reuerende Sacrament touching the body & blood of Chriſt, to be both miniſtred vnto the laye people, and alſo that Chriſt ſo ordeyned the ſame: and that ye Apoſtles in like maner deliuered and vſed the ſame: and that it was ſo adminiſtred from the Apoſtles time, vntill the Counſell kept at Conſtance, 120. yeares agone. When theſe thinges are layd againſt them, when they are vrged with theſe matters, ſo that they can bring forth nothing againſt thē. nor deny any of them: yet notwythſtandynge to

               
               
               
               
they beare rule in the worlde. That thing euidently appeared by his workes and miſcheuous practizes. A man may ſee in the Euangelicall hiſtory euery where, how wretchedly he turmoyled, vexed and tormented them, whoſe bodyes hee poſſeſſed: with what violence hee holdes them, and how hee driueth them whether ſoeuer hée will. A man may ſée how great tyranny he exercyſed in Iudea, how many he inuaded, & how he bereft them of theyr wits and ſences. Wée reade in the 13. of S. Lukes goſpell, that a woman had the ſpirit of infirmitie 18, yeares and howe ſhee was ſo ſhronke together, that ſhee could not holde vppe her head at all. This woman (ſaid Chriſt vnto her when hee had healed her) had Sathan bounde ſo many yeares.
                  Sathans power permitted by God.
                Hee is able to ſende diſeaſes vnto mennes bodyes, hee is able alſo to ſtirre vppe and bringe amongſt mankynde plagues, and other dyſcommodities and calamityes, as alſo fyrye impreſſions, hurtfull tempeſtes, battelles, ſedicyons, ſpoylinges of countryes and citties, with all maner of miſchéefes.
            
               By what and how cruell meanes did he exerciſe that holy man Iob!
                  Iobes afflictions.
                When God had ſuffered this to be doone vnto him, Sathan foorthwith brought vpon his familie and ſubſtance euen a certaine huge ſea full of all Calamities & hinderances.
                  Iob. 1.2. & 3. Firſt by Sathans inſtigation, the Sabaeians violently ruſhing vppon his grounde, droue awaye his Bulles, Oxen and aſſes, ſlaying his Seruauntes alſo. Afterwardes a fyer beeing by Sathan caſte downe out of the Ayre brent all Iobes Sheepe, Shepheardes and Seruauntes. Incontinentlye after that, the Caldeans wyth three furniſhed armies made an aſſault vppon hys Cammelles, tooke them by force awaye, and ſmote hys younge menne with the edge of the ſworde. Beeſides theſe, when the ſonnes and daughters of Iob, were receiued at a banquet in the houſe of hys eldeſt ſonne, and refreſhed them ſelues alltogether with meate and drinke, hée ſtirred vp a moſt gréeuous and horryble tempeſt: So that a moſte outragyous wynde comming

               
               
               
               
béene ſo ſhutte and faſt bound in any ſecrete place or déepe dungeon, that hée coulde neuer burſt out of his chaynes and get looſe from thence, then might we bée ſafe ynough, and then might we lawfully (as they ſay) ſléepe ſoundly on both ſides, with eche foote in eyther eare couched.
            But in very déede ſeeing he is an enimy ſuch and ſo great, ſo mightie, ſo enuious, ſo ſpitefull, ſo bitterly ſwelling and enflamed, ſo treacherous, ſo cruelly, fearce, ſo craftie, ſo wylie, ſo changling ſo watchfull, ſo labourſome, ſo wicked and alwayes ſo néere our daungers, which nowe for a certaine M. of yéeres ſpace hath wonderfully exercyſed mankind, hath aſſaulted vs with all kind of weapons, and eftſons hath circumuented vs with one or other ſubtill ſnares: Neither is he once tyered nor awearied at any time, but walketh vp and downe, and, ſhall walke vp and downe lyke a Lyon roring, and béeing thorowly enraged, ſéekes none other thing, practyſeth nor imagineth any thing elſe, then to ſwallow vp and deuour mā: That is to ſaye to conſume, tread vnder foote,

deſtroy and vtterly to extinguiſh all mankinde in bodye, ſoule, good name and worldlye ſubſtance. Theſe things ſith they ſo be, vndoubtedly we may not ſléepe ſo ſoundly and become ſo ſlothfull and ſo ſluggiſh. When wee ſléepe, he ſléepes not, but watcheth moſt circumſpectly with eyes alwayes fixt towardes ſome occaſion, that hée maye ſteale vppon vs, when we are ſo ſléepie ſluggiſh and ſo careleſſe. Hée is in euery place, yea hée is neere and amongſt vs, euen in the very ſecret places of our houſes, neither ſteppes hee once an naile bredth from vs, and aſſaulteth vs by diuers and wonderfull meanes: this man by this meanes, and that man by that Ramme and warlike engen of temptation (as it may agreeably ſerue with his name) dooth hee 
                  •
               rye men.
            For hée is called Tentator in Latin, which, (in Engliſhe, Math. 4.) wée reade to bée, a Temptor to euill. If hée cannot caſt thée headlong into this miſchéefe, hée frameth other engynes to caſt thée, into an other. In thy houſe and familyes ſtirreth hée vp

               
               
               
               
promptitude,
                  What time Sathan watcheth to worke his miſcheefe.
                and gratitude of mindes as it ought to be, then eaſilie and forthwith is he able to plucke out and roote out of our heartes that wholeſome ſéede of the Goſpell, that men ſhould not beleeue the ſame and obtaine ſaluation, like as Chriſt himſelfe teacheth in .8. Luke, Of the ſéede falling néere vnto the hie way. He is able to intangle and draw thée quite away into ye company of lewde perſons, which when they haue defiled thee with their diſeaſe, are able with their infection ſo to corrupt thée, that there ſhall neuer be any hope of recouerie in thée afterward: And that all this labour ſhall be loſt in the twinckling of an eye; yea all diligent carefulneſſe, and carefull diligence which parents beſtowe and imploy vpon their Children in bringing them vp, inſtructing and informing them, is all to no purpoſe. By lyke contagion, ſayth the verity in Iohn 13. did the deuill put into the heart of Iudas, to betray his maiſter Chriſte.
            This ought we rightly and diligently to conſider and not ſlenderly to regarde: That Sathan is ſo néere man, that in

neere vs, yea euery where layeth hee ſnares for vs, watcheth ech where, and 
                  •
               s redy to all occaſion, that with ſo great power, ſuch craftines, ſo wonderful, ſo ſubtill, and ſo wily deceipts or illuſions he is able to caſt man ſeduced, headlong into ſinnes: and when he hath once poſſeſſed his heart, and infected it with one myſcheife or other, he is able out of one miſcheife to caſt ye ſame perſon into another, far more greeuous more horrble, and more wonderfull. Let that be alwayes conſidered in our mindes, and let it not ſlyp out of our memory which S. Paule ſayth. Ephe. 2. That euill Spirite dwelleth in the Children of Diſobedience.
            
            Neither violently draweth he the vngodly ones alone out of one miſchief into an other,
                  Sathan hindereth as vvell the godly as the vngodly
                but hée can euen binder & ſtay the very godly perſons, that they the leſſe ſhall be able to finiſh any godly or holy worke begon, and not ſuch with expedition & care as they otherwiſe both ought and would doe: except they bende themſelues continually with prayers againſt thoſe his ſnares or deceits, and except they diligently & dayly be watchful.

their miniſterie and function, with great faith and diligence doe they guide, direct gouerne and defende vs: They are preſent with vs, helpe vs euery where, prouidently take care of vs, and doe obtaine for vs all thinges tending to the glory of Chriſt, and euen reconcile him vnto vs, doe inſtill and beate into our mindes his holy will, ye doe call vs away and plucke vs backe from al thoſe ſinnes and vices which God hath forbidden vs, and which he abhorreth.
            For that cauſe. S. Paule. 1. Heb. deſcribeth good Angels on this maner.
                  Good Angels miniſtring Spirites.
                
               Are they not all miniſtering ſpirites, which are ſent forth into the miniſtery for their ſakes, which ſhall be heyres of ſaluation? Héere we learne that Angels are Ambaſſadours and Meſſengers ſent from heauen, euen from God vnto true beléeuers, to ſerue and attende vppon them, and in al aſſaies to bée preſent with thē, to ſuccour them, helpe them, and to preferre the good enterpriſes, ſtudies, and godly actiōs of them, which ſhall be made 
                  •
               prtakers of the inheritance of eternall life. For, this is their chéefe and moſt feruent prayer, that we may by and by

be conuerted from euil and vngodly life, and repent vs vnto better and more profitable amendment, and that we ſhould abide ſteadfaſt in the truth, & they do infinitely reioyce, when we are conuerted from ſins vnto God, which thing Chriſt himſelf ſaith in .18. Luke. Héere are their hearts manifeſt knowen to vs, how ſincere, howe godly, how wellwilling and how ready they are to doe vs good, yea how feruently they loue vs, & how faithfully they embrace vs.
            O, that wee could ſée with corporall eyes with how firme & ſtrong ſauegarde and ſuccour of his Angels God gardeth & preſerueth defendeth and protecteth vs from all dangers whereunto we ſhould otherwiſe runne headlong: were it not that God protected vs with his Angels, (good God) with how gréeuous hazardes ſhoulde wee bee enſnared and diſtreſſed.
                  Gods protection of his elect by his good Angels.
                How little helpe in our ſelues or elſe any where might we finde, how ſhoulde we be perplexed, how ſhould we be tormented, how moſt miſerable of all creatures ſhould we become? For by nature, wee are faintharted and fearefull ſillie ſoules, and wee are alwayes afrayde,

               
            
            
            
            
               
               Caeſar or the king of Aſſiria called Zenacherib had beſeeged Hieruſalem with an hoaſte of .185000. men:
                  Hieruſalem deliuered & her enimies ſlaine by gods Angels.
                and king Ezekiah by reaſon of the ſmall nomber of men which hée had within the Citie was far vnequall & of power more féeble in reſpect of the king of Aſſiria: But neuertheleſſe yet, hée deliuered his people from all violence and iniurie: For, God ſent his holy Angell which in one night ſlew the ſame huge multitude of men, the hoaſt of Zenacherib ſo that in the morning earely all places were full of dead bodyes, as it appareth, 4. Reg. 19. And what iniuries and calamities would not that moſt peſtilent enimie bring as well vnto Mothers as infants, but that good Angels preſerued the infantes and their Mothers? Infantes and Children myghte fall into the waters, yea into the fire, and might chaunce into many other perrils, were it not, that GOD ſauegardeth them with his good Angels, which for this purpoſe are ordayned of God, to haue faithfull and perpetuall care ouer vs, like as Dauid in the .90. Pſal, ſingeth. He hath giuen his Angells charge ouer thee to

keepe thee in all thy wayes & to beare thee in their armes, yt 
               thou daſh not thy foote agaynſt a ſtone. But what Sathā
                can doo how great his power & ſtrength is, God now & then ſheweth vnto the world, ſuffering Sathan ſomtime after his owne luſte to bring vpon the world ſome hinderaunce & calamitie, to worke many troubles, ſomtimes cauſing ſedicions & ſomtimes murders. And therfore god ſuffers ye ſame, to the end we might take heed and beware of him the more diligently, that we may liue in greater feare of God, and not ſleepe in ſin as euen careleſſe and gaping after the ſame. For when as good Angels by the ſecret iudgment of God do euen for a moment forſake and not ſaugard vs, by and by is Sathan then preſent, and worketh iniury towardes vs by all meanes that hee may, after his owne luſt, and performeth his worke againſt vs, he either violently caſteth Children into waters, or fyre, o
                  •
                giues them kniues wherby to hurt thē. And the ingratitude or ſin of their parents ſometime do deſerue this, that Sathan haue ſome ſufferance hereunto. In our time not farre hence was a certaine

               
               
               
               
his peculyer Angell, and therefore all true Chriſtian men haue his proper Angells. And therefore in euery place alſo when wee are by our ſelues and with out moderators, it becometh vs to bee chaſte, ſhamefaſt and modeſt, as wel in wordes as in geſtures, in honor of thoſe good Angells yt wee offende them not as Paule. 1. Cor. 11. teacheth, that women ſhould haue their heads couered & cloſly attired,
               
                  S. Paules rule.
                
               in the Church, by reaſon of the Angells, which are enioyned & giuen vnto vs, that they may alwayes and in all places gouerne vs, comfort vs, defend vs, teach vs, be preſent with vs, & helpe vs. In our childe byrth, in our iorneying, in all things and in all daungers, for all our lyfe long, euen vnto the finall ende and laſte parte playing of the race of our dayes, yea euen vntill the abſolute and full ſaluation and glorification of vs. Touching which matter let vs geue eare vnto moe teſtimonies of the ſacred ſcriptures.
            In Acts Cha. 11. Peter was bound in the priſon with two chaynes & was diligently and carefully kept & watched of the ſouldiours, leaſt hee ſhould eſcape away.

But what hapned?
                  S. Peters Angell the 2 time. when Peter ſlept in the night, the Angell came to him and ſayde: Ariſe by and by and ſtraight way the chaynes fell from hys handes, and the Angell brought him looſe out of the priſon, and ſo the Lorde by his Angell deliuered hym out of the handes of Herod.
            In .5. Acts, when the chéefe Préeſtes with the Saduces at Ieruſalem had taken and caſt the Apoſtles into priſon,
                  The Apoſtles Angell.
                the Angel of the Lord in the night, (the dors of the priſon beeing open,) brought out thence the Apoſtles, commaunding them to preache the Goſpell vnto the people.

                  Maries Angel.
                The Angell ſhewed Ioſeph in his ſleepe, that Mary ſhould bee with Childe not by man, but by operation and power of the holy Ghoſte, and reuailed the Chyldes name, alſo, which ſhoulde bee giuen him, viz: Ieſus. Alſo Math. 2. The Angell againe warneth Ioſeph to flye with the childe and his mother into Egypt. And when Herod was dead the Angell againe came to Ioſeph warning him that he ſhould returne home out of Egypt into the land

               
               
               
               
confidence in them,
                  Whether Angels are to be worſhipped or no.
                call vppon them in our neceſſities, and craue helpe of them▪ In ye Popedome (as ye know) that is obſerued, & peculier temples or Churches are alſo builded for them, and dedicated vnto them. But this honour was both vnprofitable and vngodly, inſtituted and deuiſed by mans méere election and good intention.
            The Scripture teacheth vs, that we muſt not repoſe our hope and confidence vpon any other, but vpon one onely and true God, and that he onely is to be called vpon in neceſſities, as in deede the true and moſt aſſured helper in al euils, lyke as we learne in the .1. and .2. commaundement. And the Scripture ſaith Ieremy. 17. That he is bleſſed which putteth his truſt in God. Againe, Dauid ſaith in his .77. Pſal. The childrē which ſhall bee begotten, and ſhall ariſe, ſhall declare vnto the Children, that they put their truſt in God, and not to forget the worke of God, but ſearche foorth his commaundementes.
            
            But hearken, what (as touching inuocation of Saintes, the godly ones in the Church for a thouſand yeeres, haue

helde opinion: Leaſt yee ſurmiſe that I teache you in this behalfe any newe inuention.
            
               ¶ Saint Auguſtine writing vpon the .96. Pſalme, ſaith thus.
               
                  
                     ANd giue eare (ſaith hee) as touching holy men,
                  
                     The doctrine and opiniō of S. Auguſtine concerning Angels not to be vvorſhiped.
                   
                  which are like vnto Angels. Whē thou findeſt any holy mā, the ſeruant of God, If thou wouldeſt worſhip and honour him for God, he forbiddeth thee: He will not arrogate vnto him Gods honour, He will not be as a god vnto thee, but vnder God with thee. The holy Apoſtles Paule and Barnabas, did this: They preached the word of God in Lycaonia. When they had done miracles at Lycaonia, the Citizens of ye country brought vnto thē ſacrifices & would haue ſacrificed vnto them, calling, Barnabas Iubiter and Paul, Mercury: But they tooke no pleaſure in that.
                     Acts. 13. Or would they not paraduenture therefore any ſacrifices ſhould be offered thē: bicauſe to be compared themſelues vnto

                  
                  
                  
                  
What then my brethren? (ſaith .S. Auguſtine) Let no man ſay I feare leaſt the Angell be angry with me, if I worſhip him not for God: Then is he angry with thée, when thou wouldeſt worſhip him. For he is a good Angell and loueth God. Thus farre ſaith Saint Auguſtine, in Pſalm. 96.
            
            
               ¶The ſame Doctor in his booke De vera Religione Cap. 55. hath theſe wordes.
               
                  
                     ANgelos honoramus Charitate, non ſeruitute. &c. Wee honour the Angells with loue and not ſeruice. Neither do we build them Churches: For, they will not haue thē
                  ſelues ſo honoured of vs: Bycauſe they know that euen we our ſelues,1 Cor. 3. 2. Cor. 6. Epheſ. 2. Acts. 17. (if we be good and Godly perſons,) are the temples of the mightie God. Truly, is it written therfore, that man is forbidden of the Angell, not to worſhip him, but one God, vnder whom he was euen fellow ſeruant of him. Theſe alſo are S. Auguſtines wordes which as yet the Catholique Church hath not reiected: For

they are grounded in the Scriptures, or with moſt firme teſtimonies of Scrip
