            SCHIR IOSHNE KNOX ANSVER.
            THe first part of his counsall we aproue and adde
thairto that the lyf euerlasting consistes in the knowlege
of him whome he has send Iesus Christ. That he
that beleuis in the sone of god hes lyfe euerlasting, and
is all redie past from deith to lyfe, bot he that beleuis nocht
sel nocht se lyfe: but the wraith of god aby dis vpon
him. we further affirme that without the sociecie and bo
some of the trew kirk, neuer was, is, nor salbe saluatioū
vnto man. In thir and lyke generall heidis we disagre
nocht frō the Papistis, but the diference and dout standis
in the specialis, to wit, quhat faith is, and what ground it
hes, what is religioun, and wherin it differis from superstit
                  •
               oun,
and from I dololatrie. And finallie what is the
trew kirk, and whou it may be decerned from the sinagoge
of Sathan. Thir heades we say onght he in special
to haif intreted wnto zou if he had bene mynded
to haue instructed Zou in a treuth▪ But becaus (as the
progres of his letter declareth) his mynd was to draw
you to ye boudage of that Romane Antechrist, he takes
generall propositions most trew, and most certane
in thame selues, wherupon he wold conclude
that which is most fals and all together pernitious
to the salauatioun of man. Bot thet the craft of

sathan moir euidently appear, we shall draw his persuasioun
in forme of argument, and efter returne to the farther
meaning of the Propheit, and to the declaratioun of
thir termis faith, religioun, and catholick kirk▪
the Propheit affirmes that whosoeuer sall nocht serue Ierusalem
shall perishe.
            Bot the promeis maid to Inrusalem, apertenis wnto
the kirk, ergo whosoeuer seruis nocht the kirk fall perisse.
This hoil argument we admit, and most cōstantly we
do affirme it, and yet sall he neuer be able to proue his
entent, which is, that the kirk of scotland is no kirk we
wil oppin the wound which the wryter of the letter
keapes couerit, and yet it most greuis him, as it doeth
the rest of all Papistis. The realme of scotland (all praise
to god) hes refused the Pape that Romane antechrist,
and nocht only be preaching bot also be the publict lawes
hes dampned his tyrannical lawis, his odious superstitiouns
and vsurped iurisdictioun. And thairfoir cry
the Papistis, that we at declyned from the trew kirk and
ar f
                  •
               llen back from the catholick faith. But befoir that
thai be able to conuict ws of those crymes thay monprei
                  •
               
two thinges, 
                  •
               ormer, that whatseouer was promysed
to Ierusalem, dois properly and only apertene wnto
Rome, and this mon thay do not be coniectures, but be
plane wordis as god prononced be his propheit of Ierusalem▪
this is the first. the secound is, that albeit Rome
war als able to proue a promise maid to it as Ierusalem
was of whome it was said this is my rest heare will
I dwell. becaus I haue, chosin it, and albeit that the Papis
of Rome whome he stylis the perpetuall successioun of
that kirk, had as ane assured and plane probatioun, that
be god thay wre called, be god they wer admitted, and
that be god thay sould be mantenyd in thair ministerie
and functioun, as that the leuites and successioun of Aaron
had to produce at all tymes for their defence, yet if
they (we say) who call thame selues the successouris of
the Apostlis be nocht able to proueihat thai haif constantly
remaned in the first league and conuenant which
christ Iesus maid with his Apostolis when he send
thame furth to preache the glaid tydingis of the kingdome,

and to establish his throne, not only amonges the
Iewis, bot also amonges the gentiles, according to the
former propheseis. Albeid we say that all thir former
thai wer able to proue (as thai ar neuer able to do) yet
haue they said no thing that may help thair caus, not
hurt ouris, onles that they thairwith planely proue that
the kirk of Rome and the successioun of the same hes remanit,
and yet remaneth in the original pu
                  •
               itie of the
Apostils in doctrine, lyfe, lawes and ceremoneis. For thir
being corrupted the tytill of successioun will na mair
help thame thē did the braging of the preistis wnder ye
law, who cryit aganis the propheit leremie, the temple
of the lord, te temple of the lord the temple of the lord▪
what was answeret wn to them, let the .7. chap. of his
prophesie witnes Butfarther of the assurance theirof, efter.
Now mon we sumthing speak of faith, religioun and
catholick kirk wherwith he wold terrifie yowr conscience,
and deface the trewth,Ierem 7. and then mon we
auswer to his bleaspheamous tauntis and mockage,
befoir we ha
                  •
               f confessit that to leue without faith,
without religioun, and vithout the societie of the catholick
kirk, bringis with it most cettanely death and
damnatioun. But yet we affirme that al opinioun that
is commonly receaued wnder the name of faith is
nocht faith whilk god aprouis, bot trew faith mon haue
for the ground and assurance theirof godis expressed
word, of his mercy promysed in christ Iesus, wher to the
heart of the faith full mon cōsent so moued be the haly
gaist. And thairfoir we fear not to affirme that the Papistis
hauing no better ground for thair faith, then cōsent
of men, decreis of counsals, and antiquitie of tyme, ha
                  •
               f
no faith, bot a fond, yea▪ a damnable opinion. And the
same we affirme of religioun which if it be pleasing and
acceptable wnto God, must haue his awin commandement,
and approbatioun for a warrand: otherwais it
can nocht be bot odious in his presence, as a thing repugning
to his expres commandement: saying, not
that which appearis Good in thy awin eyis sall thou do
to the lord thy God, bot what the lord thy God hes
commanded the, that do thou, ade nothing to it, diminishe

nothing from it. Be this precept of that eternall
God who is immutable, and that can command
nothing but that which is iust, a
                  •
                all pl
                  •
               ple, realms, and
natiounis (that will auow theme selues to be the inheritance
of the lord) bound and oblist to measure their
religioun, not be the exemple of other realmes, nather
yet be their owen good intentioun; or determinatioun
of men, but only be the expressed word of God.
So that what theirein is commanded aucht to bedone,
and what is not commanded be him, aucht in na
wyse to be done be the people of God, what apperance
or externall shaw of holynes that euer it hes. And
thairfoir haue we most iustly reiected the rable of ceremoneis
which the Papistis held for the cheif exercise
of thair religioun, as thingis hauing na better ground
then the inuention and consent of men. Now shortlie
of the kirk communlie callit catholick. The name
of the kirk is commun and is taken as weil for the
congregatione of the wicked as for the assemble of
the godlie, as it is plane be the wordes of Dauid
sayng: I haue hatet the kirk,
                  
                     •
                  hal. 26. or the assemble of the
wicked, the terme Catholick, which signifyes vniuersal,
heth not included in it that vertew which Papistis
alledge, that is, that whatsoeuer is Catholick that
most be goode. For if so wer than sin in the originall
world shuld haue bene gude▪ for it wes so catholick
(that is vniuersall) that it ouerfloued the hole earth only
on hous excepted. whou vniuersall Idolatrie was
amongis the Gentiles, histories witnesse, and whou
braid the pestilent sect of Machomet is this day spred,
experience dois teich ws. And yet we suppone that no
man of right iudgement will aither approue the one
or the other, notwithstanding of their vniuersalitie,
and thairfoir we must haue a better assurance of the
kirk, to the which we aucht to ioyne our selfis then
that it is catholick or vniuersall, to wit it must be holie
and the communioun of sainctis. For in the confessioun
of oure faith, we say not I beleue the kirk vniuersall,
bot I beleif the holie kirk vniuersall, the

communioun of fanctis. wherfoir we affirme, that if
that kirk whiche is called catholick or vniuersall, haue
not holynes in the heart be trew faith,Or the harpan. and the confessioun
of the same in the mouth, and in the foirheid it
ceissis to be the immaculate spous of Iesus Christ, in
whose bosome the sonnes of God at nurished to the
lyfe euerlasting. And so befoir that the wryter of the
letter shall be able to conuict ws, that we haue declyned
from the holy kirk, he must first defyne what
is the verray holynes of the kirk, wherein it consistis,
fra whom it flowis, and what is the effect of the
same. And when thus he hes done, he must proue
yat the kirk of Rome hes bene and is only holy, so
that no kirk befoir it did euer enioy that tytill, nether
yet that any that after may ensew it, may sa be
iustlie callit, and thus we think shalbe werray hard
to Maister Tyrie and all the Iesuites in Europe to
proue.

I suld begin. First he sais, that of tuay propositiones
quhilkis ar verray trew, I collect ane conclusione
maist fals and repugnant to all veritie. Ane Dialectitian
wald ansuer, that schir Iohne knox hes nocht
weill considderit the rewlis of Dialectik, to affirme ane
fals conclusion to follow of trew premissis. Bot becaus
I knaw his greit occupationis and sollicitude he hes
of his wyf and childrine, that he culd nocht tack tent
to sic trifflis I will pas this with silence, and

tak tent
                  •
               to sic trifflis I will. pas this with silence and
will enter schortlie in the mater. He domandis ws two
thingis, gif we wald establiss the Romane kirk to be the
trew kirk. The first is that we schaw quhat sumeuer
wes promised to Ierusalem to appertien onlie to the Romane
kirk: I ansuer that the promeis appertenis to ane
kirk quhilk suld be catholick or vniuerfall: lyk as
we say I beleue the halie catholick kirk: suay gif
na kirk or congregatioun of men quha professis the
name of Christ at all tyme hes bene Catholick, nor
zit is Catholick except the Romane kirk (quhilk dois
nocht onlie comprehend the toun of Rome bot alsuay
the haill warld, quhilk in vnitie of doctrine dois aggre
with it) it followis necessarlie, that quhatsumeuer wes
promised to 
                  •
               erusalem, dois onlie appertene to the Romane
kirk. And this to zour first domand.
            the secund domand is that albe
                  •
               d the promeis be
maid to the Romane kirk we schaw mairour that it
hes remanit in the first conuenant with oure Saluiour.
This domand contenis in it ane maist wicked blasphemie:
for Schir Iohne knox Supponis, that God micht
promeis that quhilk he wald nocht accompleis, quhilk
is no thing els bot to mak him ane liar. Thairfore it requiris
na new ansuer, becaus. the promeis of God is fer
me and certane, that gif he hes promised to mantene his
kirk be the assistance of his holie spreit to the end of the
warld, we aucht to be assured thairof quhatsumeuer
Schir Iohne knox say: quhais impudencie and arrogance
is so great in this behalf that he apperis mair
wicked, nor Sathan him self his Maister. Becaus albeid
that the Romane kirk haue the promeis of God to be
mantened, zet onles it proue that it hes bene, and is as

zit mantenit, he will gif na credence nor authoritie
thairto. And be the contrar albeid he and his ministers
be destitute of all promeis, zet he will quhatsumeuer
he says to be embraced as the trew and sincere woird of
God. Gif his arrogance be greit, I leif the iugement to
the reader. As to re place of Hieremie the propheit quhilk
Ze cite, it makis no thing for zour opinione, bot reather
is aganis Zow, becaus as the text schawis manifestlie,
he spak nocht onlie to the preistes bot to the haill multitude,
quhome he accusis that thay had maist enormlie
transgressit the commandimentis of God, bot becaus
the people vsit to obiect to the prophetis quhen
thai wer admonised be thame that thai had the temple
of the lord, euin as thairbie thai had bene in
greit securitie, and na euill culd befall wnto thame.
Hierrmie dois reiect sic obiectionis, sayand that sic
vane persuasionis will no wais auale thame onles be
sincere and onfenzed repentance thai turne wnto
God, and leue accordinglie to his law. He denyed
nocht 
                  •
               s ze affirme that thay had the trew kirk
of God and that God was treulie worsehepit in the
synagoge, bot admonised the people to gloir nocht in
that as that thairthrowonlie thai micht pleis God lyk
as we say now that it will nocht be proffitable to ws
that we haue the trew kirk and the trew doctirne,
onles oure lyf and maners correspond thairto. Bot lat
ws pas fordward.
            Ane argument quhilk uset euer to be obiected be Catholick
men aganis Zour new inuented kirk is this,
The trew kirk of God aucht euer to be catholick or
vniuersall: Zour kirk hes nocht euer bene vniuersall:
thairfore it can nocht be the trew kirk of God. Zeansuer,

that quhatsumeuer is vninersall is nocht consequentlie
good, as Ze deduce be mony exemples. Quhilk
ansuer as euerie man may sie is naway to the propos
Becaus albeit it wer granted to Zow that it war
nocht sufficient to the trew kirk to be vniuersall, zit
ze can nocht denye bot it is necessare. I hairfoir gif ze
hed ansuerit to the propois, ze suld haiue schawin zour
kirk to haue bene vniuersall at all tyme. Bot apperandlie
conuicted be zour conscience, and be experience
it self ze confesse all radie the contrar: and thairfoir
reiectand that mark, quhilk of it self is maist euident,
and approuit be all scriptures, ze seik refuge
to ane vther mark, quhilk is far mair obscure, and
onknawin, quhilk is, that the trew kirk of God aucht
to be halie, For the halines of the kirk is onlie knauwin
to him quha doith vnderstand the secretis and heartis
of mē, and thairdy being only knauwin to God it can on
naways be ane taikin to ws of the trew kirk. Bot gif ze
wald affirme the halines of the kirk to confist in the
dew and lauchfull administratioun of the sacramentis
and cōdigne professione of the faith, as ze appeir to allege▪
ze micht alsuay thairby perfytlie vnderst and that
it is in Lykmaner obscuir and ane ondecydet controuersie.
For all heret
                  •
               kes hes continuallie vnto this present
hour vsurped that as ane taikin and note for approbatioun
of thair kirk. As to the notis and taikines of tho
trew kirk, thay suld be sua appropriat to it, that thay
may nocht be vsurpet be fals propheites be onie meanis,
as that the kirk is vniuersall, and that it hes continewall
successioun of pastoures: Quhilk tuay markis did
neuer as zet aggrie to onie assemblie or congregatioun
of heretikes. Becaus that all heretikes hes decayet from

the trew kirk, suay thair sinagoge at all tyme culd
nocht be vniuersall, and be that same resson thay culd
neuer be albe to schaw contineuatioun of thair pastoures.
Bot did euer gadder to thame selfis ane ordour of
ministeris without onie lauchfull beginning, as testifeis.
S. Augustin in his questionis of the auld and new
testament, saing, quhasoeuer hathe collected thame selfis
ane seit nocht in tke kirk of God, we affirme it to
be the cheir of pestilence. In respect thay do cummer
and molest the ondouted ordour begun at Petir, and be
continuall successioun of pastoures deducet vnto this
present hour making to thame selfes ane ordour without
beginning, and ane bodie without ane head. Quhairfoir
in respect thais infallible and suir notes of the
kirk of God can nocht be no meanes corespond to zour
sinagoge, it is maist notoriouflie knawin that ze and
the remanant of zour propheites ar alluterlie separat
frō the trew kirk. zet pretermittād that of fiftie sectes
quhilkis dois regne this day, euerie ane of thame dois
attribuit to thame selfe the rycht administratioun of
the sacramentis and the confessioun of faith, and beleues
as ze do, that thay teche na thing bot the sinceir
word of God. To preif that this mark dois on na
way conuein to zour kirk, for the present I will wse
bot ane aryument, The richt administratioun of ye
sacramentis, and the confessioun of faith or onlie notes
of the visible kirk: zour kirk afoir Iohne caluin was
inuisible as ze cōfesse all reddie: Th
                  •
               irfoir it culd nocht
be knawin be the formar notes, and consequentlie the
kirk of God hes bene destitute this monie kūdreth zeiris
of hir maist certane and infallible markes, quhilk is ane
great blasphemie. As quhain ze say that it wilbie verray
hard to me and to all thame quhome ze call Iesuistis to

preif that the Romane kirk onlie is halie, it is nawais
hard bot verray easie. Becaus that the halines of the
kirk is suay cōtonet with the forsaid no
                  •
               es, that is, with
the vniuersalitie and lauchfull suceession of pastouris
that it can on na ways be separat. Thairfoir considdering
that amangis all congregationis quha does profes
the name of Christ, thai onlie quha dois adheir to the
Romane kirk can be able to schaw sic successioun, with
vniuersalitie it followis of necessitie that 
                  •
               rew halines
do is onlie appertein to thame. And as Zour sinagoge is
destitute of the formar notis, sua of necessitie it is destitute
of all halines. Bot Schir Iohne knox to seduce
the semple people do is argument sua, as gif the halines
of the kirk culd be separat fra the vniuersalitie
thairof, and the lauchfull succession of Paustouris: quhilk
is maist fals, erronius, and repugnant to all scriptures.
For the Apostoles did conione thais 
                  •
               uay notes together,
I beleif the halie catholick kirk. Becaus the kirk
of God, as it is halie, sua it is caeholick or vniuersall,
And onles Schir Iohne knox proué his kirk to be catholick,
it is impossible that it be halie.
         
         
            THE REST OF SCHIR IOHNE
knox ansuer.
            BOt now that the vanitie of his argument may the
moir euidentlie appeare, we will in as few wordis
as we can examine the mynd of the propheit. Sic as diligētly
markis the scope of the propheit Isaias, sais cleirlie,
that from the 40. chap. of his prophecie to the end of
the same, he traueillis principally to cōfort Ierusalē, and
the natioun of the lewis, whose miserable distructioun
and fearefull captiuttie he foresaw in spreit. Pronunced

the same in his publict sermonis and left the memo
                  •
               riall
and on douted register their of to the posteritie, that
was to follow and was to be partakeris of all the plaigues
that wer befoir spoken? And least that they in the
myddis of you calamitie suld haif disparit of any delyuerance:
from the same 40. chap back we say that the
propheit, as the messinger of Godis mercy pronounced
to Ierusalem, to mont syon and to the afflicted Iewis,
delyuerance from captiuitie, the protectiō of God,
to be their defence, the distruction of Babylone and of
all their enemies the cumming of the Messias promysed
wnto them, the felicitie of his kingdome the vocatione
of the Gentiles, and finally the promyses flowing
from mercy that he had maid vnto them to continew
for euer. And among thir manyfold promysis this was
one, the kingdome and the natioun that sall not serue
thee, sall perishe. Now gla
                  •
               dly wald we learne of the
wryter to what realme, to what natione, to what prouince
or citie will he appoint ws, that thairin we may
serue Iesus Christ, and his immaculate spous the kirk: to
the end that we shall not perishe, if he will name Rome
and the kirk theirof, then must we demand two
thinges, the former. what become of all the faithfull
the space of a thousand yeares that flowed betuix the
making of the former promyses, and the dayis of the
Apostilis, what tyme the Euangell began publictly to
be offered wnto the Gentiles. All whiche tyme Rome
was nothing bot a den of Idolatrie, we think he will
nocht say that the faithfull perished and we ar bauld to
say that the faithfull serued not Rome nather yet the
kirk contenit thairin all that tyme, this is the first whereof
we wold be resolued. The second is that if the wryter
will alledge that during all the tyme the promise
foirsaid apperteaned to Ierusalē and wnto mont Syon:
but that after that the Euangell was receaued of the
Gentiles the promise which befoir was maid te Ierusalem
was transfered wnto Rome. If so be, we pray the
wryter that efter he hes consulted with the fynest Papistis
be they Iesuites, or be thay otheris that he will
shaw wuto ws where we shall find the resign
                  •
               tioun

and the asseurance theirof. we clearlie read the promis
maid to Ierusalem and wnto mōt syon. we find that the
euangell was there preachet in dispyte of Sathan. we
find that from thence Peter and I hone wer send to samarea
and therefter the euangell was planted amonges
the gentilles: we findfarher that Paule wrete to the
sanctes that wer at Rome, and that he himself wes caryet
presoner to it and that he remanit two yeares there
vnder custodie in his ludgeing: bot that euer the promises
maid to Ierusalem wer transferred wnto Rome, we
find not. And therofoir albeit that we of the realme of
scotland haue refussed Rome, and the tyrannie thairof,
we think not that we haue refused the societie of
christis kirk: but that we arioynit with it, ād daylie ar fed
of oure motheris breastes, becans we embrace no other
doctrine than that which, first flowed furth of Ierusalem
whois cietizenes be grace we awou oure selues to be.
         
         
            THE REFVTATIOVN.
            This ansuer is sa litill to the propos that it nedis almaist
na refutation. zit to the effect he appeir
nocht to gloir of his awin folischenes, I vill discus sumpart
mair diligentlie quhatsumeuir he says. As to his
first propositioun that this promeis was made to Ierusalem
or to mont Syon: gif he vnderstandis be Ierusalem
the Synagoge of ye Iewis, it is necessare that all kingdome
and natioun quha wald nocht pereis serue the Synagoge:
becaus Isaias spekes vniuersalie, and dois except
na natioun, sua schir Iohne with the rest of his halie propheites
most be circumcydet. Gif he vnderstandis be Ierusalem
the kingdome of Christ, his demandis quhilk is
he askes ws ar vane. The first is quhat become of the
faithfull that was▪ betuix the making of that promeis
and the tyme quhilk the Romane kirk embracet the trew

appeareth to stand in this, that befoir a thousand yeares,
thair wes people in all the world that trowed as
Papistis now trow
                  •

               a

lecticiane wold ansuer: that albeid the antecedent
war granted, the consequent may iustlie be denyed.
And the reason is, becaus that nether doeth the kirk,
the faith of the same, nor the authoritie of the Euangell
of Christ Iesus, depend vpon that which men beleued,
befoir that it was published. Nether yet is the age
of the kirk, to be compted from the tyme when it pleased
God of his mercy, either to reueale his word to any
realme or natioun, that befoir was ignorant of it, or yet
to reforme abuses, whiche haue taken roote amanges
the people of God be the negligence of men▪ And that
this reason and proportioun is trew, the consideratioun
of the planting of the kirk, and of the diuers reformationis
maid within the same, shall witnes. when God
callit Abrahame from Vr of the Caldeanis,Gen. 12. and maid to
him that promise of the blissed sead, and efter gaue vnto
him the signe of Circumcisioun: wer there not people
despersed vniuersallie vpon the face of the earth,
what ro wit and thought, that thay had a good, and perfite
religioun? yea euin that same religioun (as thay supposed)
wherin Noha serued God. And yet we knowe
that the spirite of God, dampneth the multitude of that
age of Idolatrie: and theirintill magnifies the mercy of
God, who from that corrupted multitude, called Abraham,
and be grace maid him the father of the faithfull.
Now wold we domād of the writer of the letter, if the
age of Abrahames faith, should haue bene measured
from the errour of the multitude, that past befoir him:
and if that the age of the kirk, gadderit within his hous,
should haue bene called an aucht yeare auld kirk, whē
that Abraham had so long obeyed God, while that all

               ersalitie

that was in Abrahames hous to be a new found kirk?

we say▪ being espetialie maid to Abrahā in thase

denyed but that oure kirk is new found and the doctrine

ws, which hath no better ground than the determinatioun
of thair owen counsall, can nether preiudge

nether yet can proue oure kirk to be but a new found

                  •
               iwed
in his word: then had the propheit Helias bene
into a miserable conditioun: who being but one man,
opponed him self to the king, to his counsall, to his
prophetes, preastes, and people, and in plane wordes accused
thame all of apostasie, frō his God, frō his trew worschipping
and frō the obediēce of law: and planely cō
               uicted
thame, to be Idolatoures, becaus they had imbrafed
a worshipping of God, not cōteyned in his word. It
is a wōder that the king, with his preastes, and propheites
excepted not against the propheit, and said: whow
eā that be Idolatrie, which oure kings ād people sence
the days of Ieroboā haue vsed, and māteyned for Gods
trew seruice, Thou art but one mā, ād we ar a multitude
how cā it be, that thow onlie should pleis God. But
no such thing find we obiected wnto the propheit. But
his requeast being but ane mā was obeyed: which was,
that god him self, should iudge betuix him ād thame, as
that he did, be fyre frō the heauē. This priuiledge craue
we to be granted to ws, of the Papistes in oure dayes,
to wit that thay suffre god to iudge betuix oure religione,

be of boith reiected, and so shall we suddanelie aggre.
But if that will still cry, that we ar schis matykes and
Apostates, becaus we refuse to defyle oure selues, with
their abhominationis: we can nor but appeale frō their
corrupt sentence, to the vncorrupt iudge, of whose fauoures
we ar assuredly persuader in the point, becaus he

            OTheir ze haue calumniat my argumēt, or ze heue
nocht onderstand it, for of the discours of my
letter it is easie to euerie man to perceaue, that my argument
was this. That thai, quha afoir ane thowsand
zeare, wes acknawlegit for trew Christianis throw the
haill warid, professed the cōtrare religioun to that quhilk
ze professe. Sway gif ze had ansuerit to the propois,
ze aucht to haue cōdamned thame as followares
of fals and pernicious doctrine. Thairfore to omschew
the difficultie of the mater, ze say, that the age of the
kirk, aucht nocht to be compted frome the tyme quhen
it plesis God, to reueal his word to ony natioun, Quhilk
albeit it be trew, zet nocht withstanding, geuand that
the word may be of lait re
                  •
               elit to ony particalare natioun,
it can nocht be of lait reuelit to the haill world:
Quhilk we affirme of zour doctrine, becaus as the experience
it self teachis, it was onknawen immediatlie
afoir ane hundreth zeare▪ nocht only to the realme of
Scotland, bot alsua to the haill world. Thairfore it can
nocht be the word of God, quhilk as it wes reuealit frō
               
Christ, sua sen him it hes euer bene conseruet in the
warld. And quhen euer it hes pleasit him to reueill it
to ony natioun, quhilk afoir wes ignorant, he hes vsed
thame as instrumentis thairof, to quhome of befoir it
wes reuealit: sua that we aucht nocht to abyde ony
new reuelatioun, maid to Iohne Caluin, or Schir Iohne

to the promeis of Christ, be the assistance of the
halie spreit, euer bene conseruet in it: lyk as it falbe
conseruet, in despite of Sathan, and all his ministeris,
to the end of the warld. Zet to cloik zour ignorance,
ze ar nocht aschamed to compare zow to Abraham,
and Helias: and zour kirk, to the kirk of God, quhilk
wes in thair tyme. Bot to the effect, that na man be deceaued
be sic vane persuasionis, I will declare, that
nother ze may be compared onie way with thame, or
zour new inuen
                  •
               ed kirk, to that kirk quhilk that acknawlegit.
For as concerning Abrahame, it is maist aggreable
to the veritie, that he did, with all constance retene,
and profes that religioun, quhen he receaued the circumcisioun
of God, in the quhilk a lang tyme preceidād,
he had bene instructed be his predecessouris: quhairin
gif he had bene requerit, he culd haue sufficientlie schawin,
continuatioun from the beginning of the warld to
him, and to thame be quhome he wes instructed. Quhairfore
gif zour proceding is be coincidād with Abrahame,
we desyre zow to adduce sufficiēt testimonieto proue that
religion, quhilk ze profes, to haue bene autorised in all
agis, sen the tyme of Christ to zow or ellis be nocht so impudent,
to compare zow to Abrahame, considdering it
dothe nocht appeir, that Christ hes had les prouidēce of

the kirk, sen se sched his maist pretious blude for it, nor
he hade in the days of Abrahame. Bot perchance
gif ze be nocht lyk Abrahame, ze wilbe lyk Helias:
for as Helias reprouit Achab, together with the superstitioun,
quhilk he, and the haill multitude did follow,
notwithstanding the lang continuatioun of the same,
to wit betuix the tyme of Hieroboam and that present
tyme of Achab, sua ze, and zour prophetis dois reproue
all thame, quhasoeuer follouis the auld, and
Catholict Religioun. Thairfoir we will discus quhether
zour religioun, or oures, be mair conforme to that,
quhilk was professit be Helias. And to be schort Helias
did nocht induce ane new religioun, and of befoir
vnknawin to the haill warld bot professit that, quhilk
the synagoge of the Iewes had imbraced from the beginning,
and to that present tyme continuet. suay Helias,
as said is of Abrahame, culd haue schawin successioun
of lawchtfull paustouris, quha had euer professit
his doctrine: And thairfoir reprouit Achab, becaus
he had reiected the religioun, embraced be the Synagoge,
and did follow ane maist abominable superstitioun,
of lait days institute be Hieroboam. Albeid ze wald
syle the redars eys, euin as it had bene ane lāg tyme betuix
Achab and Hieroboā, quhilk did nocht mekle exceid
the spaice of fourtie zearis. Bot gif ze had cōsidderit
diligentlie, the historie of Helias and Achab, ze micht
haue thairby vnderstād, zow and the remanēt of zour
prophetis, to be iustlie cōparit to the prophetis of Achab:3. Reg. 1
                     •
                  .
for as is cōtenit in the third buke of the kingis, Hieroboā
did cōstitute vnto him self tēplis in the heichast places,

            THE REST OF SCHIR
Iohne knox ansuer.
            THe ansner to the secund can nocht be so schort,
for his assertioun agg
                  •
               eis so lytle with the place of
the Propheit, that we 
                  〈◊〉
                in dout, whether he
has trauelled to vnderstand the mynd of the propheit.

His assertion is this. Of the kirk whereof the propheit
speaketh, it is said be him in the secūd chap: that it shalbe
manifest and visible through all the world. The
wordes of the propheit at these.
            It shalbe in the last dayes, that the montane of the
hous of the lord shalbe prepared in the top of the montanis,Isai. 2.
and shalbe exalted aboue the hilles and all nationes
sall flow vnto it. And many people shall go and say:
cum, let ws go vp vnto the montane of the lord, to the
hous of the God of Iacob, and he will reache ws his wayes,
and we will walk in his pathes. For the law shall
go furth of Syon, and the word of the lord from Hierusalem,
and he shall iudge among the nationes, and
rebuke many people, &c.
            In thais wordis of the propheit, we find no such thing
as the kirk shalbe manifest and visible through all the
world we acknawledge a promise of glade thinges, to
cum to be ioyned to Hierusalem, and vnto mont 
                  •
               yon,
after the miserable distructioun of the same. we find
the tyme appointed, to wit, the last dayes. But that the
promise may be better tryed, we must 
                  •
               now of the wryter,
when these last dayis began, and quhen thay shalbe
compleit. We must further know, if there be any one
certane place appointed▪ in the which it is said that the
kirk of God shalbe visible▪ and manifest in all ages These
tuo heades being considdered, it shalbe moir easie to
iudge of the assertioun of the wryter, and whou it aggreis
with the mynd of the propheit. And first we
think, that the wryter wil nocht deny, but the last dayes,
whereof the propheit speakes, begā long befoir that
euer the Euangell of Iesus Christ wes knowen, or publictlie
receaued in Rome,Heb. 1. to wit at the appearing of Iesus
Christ in the fleshe, when that 
                  •
               e reueled vnto the
world the hole will of his father. For so ar we taught
be the apostle sayng: God in auld tymes spak vnto oure
fatheres, in diuers maners be the pro, hetes: in the
last dayes, he hath spoken to ws, be his sone &c. and the
Apostle Peter, in that his most notable sermone made
to Ierusalem, the day of Penthecost,Act. 2. affi
                  •
               es, that the
prophesie of Ioell maid, as concerning the pouring

furth of Godes graces, vpon all fleshe in the last dayes,
wes euen then compleit, quhen that the holie spreit discended
doun vpon those that beleued. So then we haue
gotten the last dayes to haue begun with Iesus Christ,
who is the glorie of the secund temple:This is n
                     •••
                  ing to the 
                     •
                  opos. when think we
that thay ended. If the wryter wil say, 
                  •
                when Rome receaued
the Euangel then wes the accomplishement of
the last days As men iustly may dout thairof, so will the
apostle planelie deny it saying: the spreit speaketh euidētlie,
that in the last tymes some shall depart frō the faith
&c. Wherof we may gadder, that the Apostle appointeth,
the last tymes to continew longer, then that the Euangell
was ones publictly preached: ro wit, till that mē
               
                  •
               hould begin to sall from the faith, and giue airis to the
doctrine of deuilles. Yea if we will searche the scriptures,
we shall find that the last dayes continew from the
first appearing of Iesus Christ in fleshe, vnto his last returning
vnto iudgement. So that the last dayes, do not
onely include the first publicatioun of the Euangell,
but also the defectioun from it,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                yea, and the restitutioun
of it agane, vnto the world: be the brightnes wherof,
that man of sin should be reuealed, and distroied:
wherof we conclude that if the last dayes do yet continew,
wherof the prophet maketh mentioun, the thinges
promised to be performed in theme, are not yet alltogether
compleit, but ar in thare progres, and shall so
procead,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                till that all be finished that is for spoken be the
holie prophetes, and Apostles of Iesus Christ. And so
may Iesus Christ this day, be working in Scotland▪
albeit that Papistes rage against his Euangell, as in
thase dayes he wroght in Hierusalem, when the preastes
and the hole visible 
                  •
               kirk (for the most part) raged
against the same. But now to the secund head.
            we wald knaw, if the wrytar can appoint vnto ws
any one certane place, whair this montane of God, is
promysed to Remane, manifestlie and visible. For this
we mak knowen to the hole world, that for the lufe
we beare to the building and reparing of Goddes holie
hous, we haue endangered lyfe, and 
                  •
                all thinges temporall.
And theirfoir if the writter can appoint wnto

ws, a certane place, wherunto God hes maid 
                  •
                promise,
we shall euerie one exhort an other with all diligence
to go vp tharūto. But if he can appoint none, haueing
greater assurance be Godes mouth, more then an other:
then will we cheritabillie desyre him, to desist from
taunting and mockage of so notable workes of God,
as he of late yeares hes shawen in mo realmes thā one.
Oure maister Christ Iesus apointes ws, to no one certane
place, where that we shal be assured of his presens:
but reather forbidding the obseruatioun of all places,
he sendes ws to his owen spirituall presence, saying:
wheresoeuer two or thrie are gathered in my name,
there am I in the middest of thame.Matt. 28. And in ane other
place, behold I am with zow to the end of the world.
we being groūded vpon these promyses, haue good hope
through Iesus Christ, that in oure
                  •
                congregationis.Matt. 18.
we haue the fauorable presence of Iesus Christ, asweill
in his word, as in his holy sacramentes. For in his name
alone conuene we, be him alone we call vpon
God oure father: and be

montane. we ar a natione (how abiect that euer
we appeare) why then will the wryter deny wnto ws
fre passage to the hous of the lord: seing that the terme
of the last dayes is not yet expyred, and seing that
we desire to be taught in the wayes of the lord, and
to walk in his pathes: yea, seing that thousandes in
Scotland refuses not to be rebuked of the lord, and
to suffer him to iudge amanges ws. If the wryter
will say, becaus we will not acknawlege Rome, to
be the mother of all vther kirkes: we ansuer as of befoir,
let ws hear the commandement of our God,
charging ws so to do, and oure obedience shall not
be long craued. For we ar most willing to obey
oure mother: prouiding that she sh

               w the ondouted
signes of a naturall mother. But an vsurped tytle, without

farther assurance, we dar not admit. And this for
his assertioun, and for the mynd of the Propheit.
         
         
            THE REFVTATION.
            THe probatioun quhilk I vsed in my letter to proue
the kirk to be visible was, becaus Isaias testifies,
that the hous of Iacob salbe builded vpon the top of ane
montane: of the quhilk wordes I collect, that it suld be
visible. Schir Iohne knox ansueris that he perceaues
nocht quhow that may be collected of the wordes
of Isaias. Becaus he spekes onlie of glaid thinges promised
to Ierusalem, and mont Syon. In the quhilk ansuer,
he declares no thing, bot his a wen blindnes. For the Propheit
testifies, that the hous of Iacob (be the quhilk the
kirk au
                  •
               ht to be vnderstand) salbe builded vpon the
top of ane montane: Christ in his Euangell says,Mat. 5. that ane
citt
                  •
               e builded vpon ane montane, can n
                  •
               cht be hid: of
the quhilk, it followis necessarlie, that his kirk cā nocht
be hid, and consequentlie it must be visible. Suay, other
Isaias be that Metaphore schawis the kirk to be visible
and manifest, or ellis it seruts to no thing at all quhilk is
ane blasphemie. The wordes that followes, dois conferme
this so cleirlie, that no man onles he be blind can ony
way dout thairof: Mony people, says he, sall flow to
the hous of Iacob, to that effect, that thay may be taught
the wayes of the lord: quhow is it possible that thay
flow to the kirk, onles it be visible and manifest: or
quhow is it possible, that thay be taught the wayes of
the lord, onles thay acknaulege thois, be quhome thay
ar to be instructed. Suay gif Schir Iohne had put on his

specticles, he micht haue sene easalie, that Isaias dois
testifie in thais wordes the kirk to be visible. I pretermit
the Grik text (quhilk ever, all maist S. Paul vsed
in his citations, and euer hes bene in great authoritie) is
so cleir for me, that it cā na way be thrawin to ane vther
sence 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is, the
montane of the lord salbe manifest. Suay dois the ancient

of ansuering hes euer bene comoun to all fals prophetis.

at his ministers, quhether gif the hous of 
                  •

wes in the top of the montane, quhen the Apostlis, and
disciplis of christ prechit his Euangell all maist throuch

flow vnto the montane of the lord: qnhether gif than,
the montane of the quhilk Daniel makis mentioun, did
occupie the hail erth:Dan. 2. quhether gif than christ receaued
the inheritance, promised to him be his father eternall.
I beleue quhousoeuer thay be impudent, thay dar nocht
deny the premissis. Than I collect necessarlie, that lang
afoir Iohne Caluin, or Iohne knox, the prophecie of Isaias
was furthfilled, and the hous of Iocob was in the
top of ane montane: that is, visible and manifest to
the warld, suay it salbe visible and manifest,
nocht onlie for ane hundreth zear, or two, bot for euer,
as testifies the for said propheit: the zeties of the kirk
salbe euer patent day and nycht: and so,Esa. 60. according to
Schir Iohne knox awin interpretatioun, be the letter

betuix the publicatioun of the Euangell, and the day
of iugement, during the quhilk, the hous of Iacob
salbe in the top of the montane. Zet he will nocht be
sati fiet onles we schaw him the place, in the quhilk

the montane of the lord [says he] is schawin to thame,Ioan. tract. 1.
thay say, it is nocht to montane of the lord, thai ar so
blindit with thair a win phantasies becaus Schir Iohne
will acknowlegeno place quhair this mōtane suld be,
bot will onlie, that we haue recours to the spirituall presence
of Christ, quhilk is expreslie aganis Isaias, quhae
sais, that mony people sall flow vnto this montane,
quhilk in na ways thay culd do, onles thay did acknawlege
sum certane place quhair it suld be: and repugnant
to Christ him self, quhair he sais,Mat. 18. Gif thy brother
offend the accuse him to the kirk: we can mak nae accusatioun
to the kirk, onles we acknawlege in quhat

lat ws considder ane litill his ressone, be the quhilk
he is mouet to sic impietie. In Sainct Matthow Christ
says, quhen euer tuo,Math. 18. or thre, ar gatherit in my name,
thair I am in the middes of thame. Of this propofitioun,
Schir Iohne collectis, that Christ appointes
to ws no certane place, quhair we sall find him. I
can nocht maruell aneuch of his impudencie, for in
the same cheptour, a litill afoir the word is quhilk he
rehersis for his opinioun, Christ commandis ws to gang
to his kirk: than he dois nocht forbid all obseruat

               oun
of places, bot be the contrar prescryues ane certane
place to the quhilk we suld haue recours: suay onles
we say he repugnis to him self, Schir Iohne knox can
na way collect of thais wordis, quhilk he citis for
him, ony thing for the auancement of his opinioun,

bot rather the contrar. For in that chaptour, Christ recommandis
to ws his lufe, and charitie, and obedience
to his kirk: And ester, he proposis the reward thair of,
that quhen sumeuer tuo, or thre, ar gadderit in his name,
he salbe in the middis of thame. But afoir that thay
be assured that thay ar gadderit in the name of Christ,
thay most be assured that thay keip luf, and obediēce to
his kirk: suay first thay aucht to be assured of the kirk,
and of mutuall lufe, and charitie with vtheris: and
thare
                  ••
               er thay may be assured, that thay ar gadderit in
his name. Bot Schir Iohne dois peruert all ordour, in
safar as he wald be certifiet, that we ar gathered in
the name of Christ, afoir that we be assured of his kirk.
At the end of zour ansuer, ze do inquire of me, gif the
vuinersall warld, and all nations be call it to pas vp in
the montane of the lord, and to the hous of the God of
Iacob▪ quhy wald I nocht that Scotland passeth vp
with the rest. Veralie I do nocht onlie maist effectiouslie
desyre it, bot alsuay prays God that thay pas vp with
all earnest full diligence. Bot I desyre nothing les, nor
thay follow zow, or zour ministers as gyderis of thame:
in caice thay do nocht only, nocht ascend to the hill,
bot rather descend, errand aud straiand in the vales
thairof. For treulie, gif Scotlande do onlie now of lait
days, pas vp with zou to the montane of the lord, and
at na tyme preceid and hath reiected the zok of idolatrie,
nor embraced the Euangell of Christ, the estate thair
of hes bene maist miserabill, and repugnant to all scriptures. For Isaias saith in the persone of Christ, the ilis of

oure ile to haue bene secludit: nor zit fra that blythnes,

quhair of Dauid maketh mentioun in this maner: The
lord has regnit,Psal. 96. lat the erth re ose, together with mony

till vs it wer a thing most greuous so to be excommunicat,
that we wer no kirk: that is, no parcell of the holie
kirk vniuersall we ansuer for our entres and say: that
befoir 15. hundreth yearis out kirk wes in Ieruslem, in

Thair we say was our kirk, which is not bound to
any one place, but is dispersed vpon the face of the hole
earth, hauing on god, on fayth, on baptisme, and on lord
Iesus sauiour of all that vnfeanedly beleue. And so we
feare not to receaue the titill and authoritie of a particular
kirk, becaus we haue all thinges be Godes word
that thereto apparteanes. Yea we ar farther bold to affir
me, that if euer it shall pleis God to bring the kirk of rome to hir originall puritie that the shall not be ashamed
to embrace and reuerence the pure kirk of Scotland▪ as
her dearast sister and nixt resembling hir in all thinges:
befour that pryd and auarice, ioyned with idelnes and
riatous leuing corrupted her ministers ād that the inuē
               tionis
of mē wer preferred to Godes simple treuth. we
say yet agane that whensoeuer the kirk of Rome shal
ebi reduced to that estait, in the whiche the apostles left
it, we ar assured that she shall vote in oure fauores, against

all such as shall deny ws to be a kirk if God continew
vs in that simplicitie which is mocked of the
world. Now let vs heare whou the wryter proceadeth.

onles that is can shaw the deu successioun thair of from
the days of Iesus Christ. And farther that the teachers
of it, do so aggre in doctrine, that in no point thay be
found to differ on from ane other. We ansuer if the immaculat
spous of Iesus Christ wer, bound to thais tuo
extremities, the bondage thairof wer maist miserable:
but becaus we find oure master Iesus Christ is moir fauorable
to his pure kirk, than maister Tyrie craues, we

let Maister Tyrie tak this for an ansuer. That an iniust
requeast may iustlie be denyed. And yet least that
the wryter or any other should think thame selues rather

that we ar able to shaw the successioun of our kirk directlie,
and laughfullie to haue flowed, from the apostlis

And oure reason is becaus that in oure kirkis we nather

            IT appeareth to ws be the hole progres of Maister Tyries
letter, that he and his factioun can acknowledge
no kirk, which in all ages hes not bene visible to
the eyes of men hauing lykwais a visible successioū. For
first he affirmes, that the kirk, wherof the propheit Isaias
speakes, should be manifest and visible through all the
world. And heare last he allegeth, that we can cum in
no place where we sall not find that religioun spred: at
the least in mony persones. And thairof he cōcludes, that
if we can not proue the like of our religioun: it followis
that it is not the trew Religioun,
            If Maiste
                  •

say we may bothe se and beliue, and be our sight our

may notifie those thinges that we ar bound to beleue.
But the questioun is, if that we ar not bound to beleue
those thinges, which somtymes ar vterlie remoued from

If Maister Tyrie be so well sene in the ancient writters, as
in his writting he wold shaw him self to be, then can he
not be ignorāt, that it is not without great caus that the
holie goist hath taught ws to say: I beleue the holie kirk
vniuersall. To wit becaus that oftentymes it is, that the
kirk 
                  〈◊〉

sic preeminence, and prerogatiue aboue the rest, quhair
thay culd nocht at ony tyme be onknawen, and thairfoir
he dois call thame the licht of the warld. Quhilk wordes
in respect thay ar iustlie referret to the pastours, we
do cōsequentlie imbring that the pastours being knawē
the kirk necessarlie man be visible: and as the licht
can nocht be in the darknes, suay the pastours of the
kirk can nocht be inuisible. He testifies alsuay, that na
man doth licht ane lanterne, putting it vnder ane firlot
bot in ane chādler, to the effect the haill hous may haue
licht: suay gif the euangell of Christ be the lanterne, be
verteu of the quhilk the haill warld is illuminat, gif the
kirk this mony hundreth zeris hath remanit inuisible,
Christ hath collocat his euangell vnder ane firlot, quhik
to allege, is ane maist abhominable impietie, and
repugnan
                  •
                to Christ him self. He saith alsuay, gif ony
man offend zou, accuse him to the kirk: than he
supposed his kirk necessarlie to be visible. And

as this precept and comand of Christ, can nocht expyre
afoir the end of the warld,Math. 18. suay euer to the end of the
warld his kirk mon be visible. Moreower, in the fundatioun
and beilding of it he certifies ws, that on naways

call zou for the present, bot the hous of God, is sa weill
beilded, and vpon ane sa firme and sure ground, that
this assalt of Sathan, quhou dangerous that euer it
be, may na mair nor the former assault. For as testifies

Sainct Paul, heresies ar permitit, to the effect
that thay, quha ar prouin be maid manifest: as he wald
say, that be heresies the kirk is mair illustrat, and the
veritie is mair tryet, and notoriouslie declaret vnto the

of all agis. To begin at Symon Mag

loue and glorifie God, that for correctioun of his kirk,
he hes permittit sic heresies as we sec to ryse in our days:
for nocht onlie be thame, the Catholick kirk is on na
ways ourcum, nor the veritie obscured that it is maid
mair cleir and euident, nor euer it wes afoir. For as to
the multitude of Christiane men, it is gretumlie incressed
sen Luther begouth to preche his fist Euangell,
as concerning doctrine and eruditioun, alsueill in
scripturis as in histories antiquittes, and all kynd
of writtars: It is sa flurish▪ and in the Catholick kirk
for the present, that: gif we wald compair thir days

the name of Christ wes nocht afoir acknawlegit we
see sic reformatioun of all kynd of estait, that we haue
greit occasioun to loue and glorifie God of his benefites.
As concerning the religioun now professit be the Catholick
kirk, it is satryed be deductioun of all agis, histories,
vritters, to be that same self religioun, quhik
euer hes bene embraced be Christian men, sen thay
begouth, that na man, quha is nocht alluterlie reprobat,
or blindit in his awin fantasies, dar deny it. Suay

we may easalie perceaue, that the force and strenth of
Sathan, sall neuer be able to ourthraw the hous of God,
nor his ministeris the lauchfull pastouris of the kirk.
Quhairthrou it is maist cleir, that the kirk of God,

                  •
               ndoubted testimony
thairof: nocht withstanding the kirk of it selfis of sic
nature, that it is nocht possible, that it be ordourlie contine
wit and conseruit, onles it be in all agis visible.
First becaus it is requisit to the conseruatioun of the
kirk (considdering it is composed of mortall men)
that sum men quha did nocht of befoir appertene vnto

it, adione thame thairto: than I domand quhow can it
be possible, that in all age thair be sum quha do adione
thame to the kirk, onles in all age it be visible. More
ower, it is requisit in lykmamer that the pastours of
the kirk haue sum power and ordour, be the quhilk
thay may be acknawlegit as lauchfull ministers: gif
the kirk at ony tyme had bene inuisible, it followis necessarli
                  •
               
that the ministers, quha dois immediatlie succeid
thairefter, becaus they haue nocht ressauit thir power
and authoritie be the kirk (considdering it wes as
than inuisible) be destitute of all authoritie of lauchfull
pastoures, suay that na man can be bound or obleist be
the law of God, to obey thame, of the quhilk the extreme
ruine and exterminione of the kirk dois necesserlie
follow. And to be schort I wald domand, gif
zour kirk, this mony hundreth zearis: hes followit,
and embraced that maner of wirschiping of God, and
administratione of sacramentis, quhilk the catholick
kirk, or as ze call it the papisticall kirk, hes followit or
nocht. Gif ze ansuer, that it hes followit sic maner of
wir schining of God as the Catholick kirk. then I collect
necessarlie that zour haill kirk wes composet of hypocritis,
that is, of thame quha exterio
                  •
                lie professit ane religione,
and in wartlie ane vther, and suay it culd nocht
be the kirk of God. becaus in our beleif we say, I beleue
the catholick kirk. Gif ze ansuer that zour kirk hes
wirschiped God in ane vther maner, that is, as ze do
now, and follow it the lyk administratione of sacramentis
as ze do: than I collect necessarlie, that it wes visible:
becaus it is nocht possible, that in ane assemblie or
congregatione of men, thay be diuers maners of worschiping
of God, and of the administratione of Sacramētis,

onles the ane pairt be knawin to the vther: suay of necessitie
thay aucht bayth to be visible. I pretermit, that
in all contrais quhair the name of Christ euer hes bene
professit, thair is historeis maist faythfullie contenand
the beginning, cours, and continuall progres of
the kirk, euin vnto this present aige: bot quhow ony
historicall narratioun culd haue correspondit to ane
inuisibll kirk, I can nocht full alie perceaue. As to
the authoritie of the ancient fatheres, pastoures,
councels, or assembleis of Christian men as said is, be
ane vniuersall consent thay confirme this to be trew:
in safar, that all the ministers of the world, can
nocht be able to produce ane in the contrar, quha in
ony aige hes bene estemit as ane lauchfull pastour of the
kirk.Math. 5. This is the trew citie collocat on the montan,
quhilk can nocht behid. This is the bricht lanterne,
quhilk can nocht be put onder ane firlot, this is, the
tabernacle of Christ,Psal. 18. collocat nocht in the darknes bot
in the sone.Psal. 62. This is the hous of God, in the quhilk
magnisicens and halines or to be found, euin to the
end. Lat zou nocht heirfoir sa gretumlie be abused,
in zour awin phantasticall imaginations, as to
beleue that quhilk is repugnant to sa manifest scriptures,
and cleir testimoneis of the maist ancient fathers:
and to conclude contrar to the vniuersall consent of
the haill warld afoir zour zou. Bot perchance Schir
Iohne knox hes fum demonstratione, or necessar argument,
be the quhilk he is mouit to say the kirk
to be inuisible, thairfore I thocht expedient to adduce
his resson, and motiue in that part: we beleue,
says he, the kirk to be catholick, thairfoir it is inuisibill.
Thus is ane argument treulie maist subtile and

strenthie, be the quhilk Schir Iohne knox prouis necessarlie
(gif he prouis ony thing) that his kirk is as
z
                  •
               t inuisible. Becaus gif he wer domandit, quhether
gif he beleuis the Catholick kirk or nocht: Gif
he ansueris he beleuis nocht, than he wantis the
maist chief article of his beleif. Gif he ansuer that
he beleuis it, than according to his argument it followis
necessarlie, that it is as zit inuisible. Thairfoir
he is constranit to grant that of the forsaid article
of the faith, it can be naways prouen the kirk
at ony tyme to be inuisible. For quhen the apostoles
authoriset, and setfurth thais articles, thay did acknawlege
the kirk: Bot gif Schir Iohne knox had bene
in thais days, be this argument he wald haue necessarlie
collected the contrar, euin aganis the apostolis
thame selues. Bot to proceid I will declair the
ground quhairupon zour ignorance is foundet. We
beleif the Catholick kirk, and neuertheles we see
the pastouris of it, we se the externall administratioun
of the sacramentis, we see the outwart signes
and ceremoneis of religioun. zit to acknawlege thame
quha vsis sie exercise of religione, to be the trew
kirk of God, and gouernit be his halie spreit, it is
necessare we haue fayth: suay at all tyme we beleue
the halie and Catholick kirk, nocht obstant all exteriour
appareill, quhilk is obiected to oure senses.
As for exemple, the heretikes seis euidentlie the
pastour
                  •
               , quhairof the Catholick kirk consistes, bot
in respect altogether thay inlaik the verteu of faith,
beleuis it nocht to be the trew kirk: thairfoir necessarlie
fayth is requeseit to beleue the kirk, euin

quhen it is maist visible. Nor zit [as ze do maist freuolie
and falslie affirme) Thomas beleued that quhilk
he saw bot that quhilk he saw nocht: he saw Christ
as concerning his humane nature, bot be faith he beleued
him to be God. Quhairfoir it is manisest, that
zour argument adduced to preif the inuisibilie of the
kirk, is vane and of nastrenth, Quhair ze conclude.
the kirk of God to tak the wingis of ane Egle▪ and flee
in the desert, ze cleirlie declair zour self ane fals propheit:
in respect that Christ hes commandit ws expreslie,
to se
                  •
               k him in his kirk and hes na les expreslie
forbiddin to seik him in the desert. Thairfoir his kirk
can nocht be in the desert. Bot grant and to zou that
it had bene in the desert, ze suld haue schawin at
mair lenth, quhow lang thair it hade remanit: and
maist cheiflie of all,

                it had bene brocht furth of the
desert. For as to ws, we haue sene nane of thame, quhome
ze say to haue bene in the desert, bot ane forloppen
companie of monkis and freris, nocht out of the desert,
bot of the closter to embrace the libertie of zour
euangell: suay I feir grethumlee, that in quhatsumeuer
desert zour kirk wes afoir zou, it do as zit thair in
remane. Thus I am constranit to say, becaus thair is na
thing in the quhilk ze vant mair, nor that Christ
hes reseruet to him selfe mony thousandis, quha hes
nocht bowit thair knie to Baal: As to zou all, considdering
ze haue embraced samtyme our religioun, gif
it be fals, ze haue all bowit zour knies to Baal:
thairfoir of necessitie ze mon all pas to the desert

to serce and inquyre thame, quh
                  •
               me Christ hes
reserued to him self, and quha hes nocht bowit as zit
thair knies to Baal. Forther, gif zour kirk afoir Iohne
Caluin wes in the desert, and alluterlie inuisible,
ze can nocht be assured in ony ways, quether gif it
vsed sic scriptures as we vse or nocht: thairfoir ze
haue na iust title [considering ze reiect the authoritie
of oure kirk) to vsurpe oure scripturis in ony ways: for
lyk as zour kirk wes in the desert, suay wes zour
scriptures, and becaus that na man hes brocht thame
furth of the desert as zit, we may instlie suspect
that thay be sumpart discrepant from ouris, at the
leist ze can nocht be assured in the contrar. Thairfoir
of necessitie ze mon proue [considdering the scriptures
can nocht be acknawlegit bot be the trew kirk)
ether that zour inuisibill kirk hes vsit sic scriptures
as we vse, or ellis ze can haue na iust title, nor
authoritie to vsurpe oure scriptures.
            As quhair ze say, that Elias be his exempill,
dois confirme the kirk at sum tyme to haue bene inuisible:
gif we wald grant vnto zow that thing
quhilk ze maist ernistfullie desire, to wit the kirk
during the tyme of Elias to haue bene inuisibill, zit
ze war no nerar zour propos. First becaus that in
the self same tyme, we haue for oure part at the
leist Elias, quhome we may produce as witnes aganis
zow: zebe the contrar can nocht be able to name ane,
during the tyme of the inuisibilitie of zour kirk. Secūdlie
the kirk of God hes at na tyme bene sa obscurit nor
hid, bot he of his prouidence hes reseruit sindrie, as ane
seminar, be quhome he hes prorogat his doctrine to the

posteritie. Thairfoir gif ze wald haue followit the exempill
of Elias, ze suld haue produced ane at the leist, indewit
with the trew wirschiping of God fra quhome
it had ordourlie cum vnto zow, and the remanent of
zour prophetis. For in this maner we reid, that Elias
did anoynt, and constitute Heliseus ane propheit. And
gif ze wald considder the haill histories of the au'd
testament, ze sall nocht be abill to find, that in ony
tyme the trew wirshiping of God did sa perische, in
the quhilk he hes nocht reseruet sum, as said is, as ane

quha dois abuse the simple and ignorāt people be

impudencie be knawin to the haill warld, I ansuer resolutlie,
that in the tyme of Elias, and in that self
same tyme quhilk ze allege, the kirk of God was visible

and manifest in the haill kinkdome of Iuda, the sacrifice
wes offerit in Hierusalem, the ceremoneis and
exercise of religioun wes practised: Io saphat quha wes
than king, was ane of the maist Godlie princes, that euer

Papists able to conuict ws of suche impictie, as
all the warld know, hath roung among thame of

mo yearis then an hundreth thryse told. And in the meane
tyme, to what honour and worldlie dignitie thay arascendet
we mak theme selues iudges. If they say the
doctrine which we teach, is wondroufly spred within
this hundreth yeares: so that now, it hes all moist red the
self furth of bondage. we waild domand of the Papistes,
if the euangell of Iesus Christ ceased to be the doctrine
of saluation,All this is no thing to the propois. what tyme the kirkis gat rest in iwdea,
and elles where, in the dayes of the apostles. If thay
ansuer, that thay meane no such thing, then yet we demād,
if the hand of the lord be more shortned now, thē
that it wes in the primitiue kirk: so that now he may
not alsweill manteane his treuth, and enlarge the kingdome
of his onely sone, as that he did in the days of the
apostlis. whatsoeuer the papistes fall ansuer, we are assured
that nether is his power diminished so that he may
not manteane his treuth: nether yet is his luf so waxen
cold towardes his kirk, but that he will in his anger remember
vpon his mercy. why do not those cruel men
considder, what innocent bloode hath bene shed for the
testimonie of Christes euangell within these thre score
yeares. wold thay that god at no tyme shuld shaw pietie
vpon the patiēt suffering of his afflicted kirk? wold thay
thay that the suord should still deuor? wold thay that
the flamming fyres should neuer be quenchet? Gif that
so thay wold, thay shaw thame selues the sones of him
quho heth bene a mortherer from the beginning, and
yet contineu in the same malice. But oure god beareth
to wardes his weak children a fatherlie affection, wherby
he is moued somtimes, to stay the furie and rage of
Sathan for a ceason: to the end, that his chosen more gladelie
may prepair thame selues to a new batall, trew it is
the doctrine of saluatiun is greatlie enlarged, and thairof
we praise god: trew it is that Sathan hath not vniuersallie
such power to persecute as somtymes he hath
had. But will Maister Tyrie thairof conclude, that in
oure kirk there is no strength? But now to the scriptures
which Maister Tyrie coateth.
            Trew it is that Dauid in his. 73 psalme according to
the compt ōf the hebreues affirmes, that nether the word

lie prosperite of the ongodlie, nor yet the afflictioun of
the godlie ought to discourage such as feare god. In this
generall head we aggre with Maister Tyrie, and with
all Papistis. But we affirme that the notes and signes,
which the holie ghost giueth in that place be the
which the wicked shalbe knowē, do noways appertene
to ws: but of many yearis moste euidentlie haue appeared,
and to this hour do yet appeare in the Pape, in many
of those that manteane his kingdome. For whether
that the generatioū of that Romane antechrist, hath bene
exemed from the troubles of men whether that thair
pryde hes bene as visible as euer wes thair garment whether

               perstitiouu haue not planelie declared, that thay
haue set their mouth against the heauen, we ar content
that the warld [be it neuer so blind] the histories of
thair liues [not written be ws bot be thair awin scribes]
and the verray experience which all mē now haue, and
heirtofoir haue had of thair procedingis beare record
wheter that thay or we be noted in that psalme. we gif
Maister Tyrie to vnderstand that we ar better acquented
with the liues and cōuersations of the Papis and Cardinales,
than thay think ws to be? and that we know the
streingth of thair lawes, decries, statutes, and consalles
better then the Iesuites knowes the reule of Iesus, albeid
that persumptiouflie thai haue vsurped his name. And
thairfoir we will craue of. M. Tyrie and of all his factioun,

or yet till suche as
thay wold persuade: that thay wse treuth ād simplicitie,
and so sall thay find thame selues better contented in
reading of oure ansueris. For this, befoir the lord Iesus
we protest that it is the treuth which we teache and
whairin we delyte: the lufe whereof causes ws abhor
all mannes inuentioun, superstition, and Idolatrie. And
thus far to the ansueris of the scriptures, which. M. Tyrie
coateth.
            Now to the sentence of the ancient writar, whoise
name he suppresseth. we say that his wordes cut the
throttes of the proud Papistes of that age and of all thair

is to be referrit to the fals preastes and hypochrites, who
