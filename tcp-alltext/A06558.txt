                  Trouth began almost in a rage
                  Of cruel Ire and of malencolye
                  And said shortly that man for his outrage

               How our lady after the byrthe of saynt Iohn baptist torned to nazareth capitulo xxiij
               
                  aNd whan this blessyd gracious dytee
                  Was sayd to god deuoutly of marie
                  I fynde after playnly how that she

                  To nazareth that she went agayne
               
               
                  
                  And there abode in contemplacion
                  In her prayers alwey day by day
                  With many an holy medytacion
                  To queme her lord in what she can or maan
                  From whom hir thought went neuer
                  Hir ful mynde ne hir remembraunce
                  For but in hym she hath no plesaunce
               
               
                  In al thys world of no maner thynge
                  For al her ioye was on hym to thynke
                  What euer she dyd prayeng or worchyng
                  No thynge but he myght in her herte synke

                  Amyd hir herte he was alwey present
                  So fixe on hym was sette her hoole entent
               
               
                  And day by day this holy lyf she ladde

                  So feruent loue vnto god she had
                  
                  There may be made no deuysyon
                  For she sequestrid hir opynyon
                  From al the world & let it playnly goon
                  So hole to god she gaf hir herte alloon
               
               
                  For euer in loue she brent more amd more

                     god in his hygh seruyse
                  Was al hir lust with herte sette so sore
                  Al erthely thyng she fully doth despyse
                  And day by day her wombe gan to ryse
                  Through the fulfillyng of the holy ghoost
                  Therein by loke whom she louyd moste

                  Sundry werkis of meruaylous empryse

                  For in this crafte inpassyng excellence
