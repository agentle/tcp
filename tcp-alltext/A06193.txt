Vpon the Lords day, beeing
the third day after our Sauiours
sufferings, two disciples

trauelling from Ierusalem to
a village called Emaus as they
walked on their way, they
talked of Iesus. And as they
thus communed, Iesus himselfe
drew neere, and went
with them,Luc. 24. 13. and afterward
questioning with them, opened
vnto them the Scriptures
tarries with them, sits witb
them, blesseth their meat, eats
with them, giues them a super
substantial blessing, for he
openeth their eyes, and they,
know him. A perf

talke of the Lord Iesus, for
you see if you bee but two in
company hee will make the
third, if you commune concerning

him in feare and reuerence,
yea your conference
shall not bee fruitlesse. For
what is the sequell? Eu
                  •
               n
knowledge of the holy Scriptures,
they shall bee opened
vppon such conference, Christ
his comfortable company by
the holy Ghost will be affoorded,
for albeit according to his

               For this cause I haue often
bowed the knees of my heart
vnto the God of heauen for
you all, and haue presumed to
reduce the summe of all into
this little Manuall, as the
Protestants portuize to carry
in his hand, in his bosome,
and to accompany him in your
trauels, as Paul had his parchments
with him, which casually
he left at Troas, and
whereof it seemed hee had an
especiall care. Let not the
prudent Iudge disdaine or
despise that I become his remembrancer,
for the time is
come that wee must looke to
our Christian principles, seeing
many are gone so farre to
question long receiued truthes
in the spirit of subtiltie and
error, as if the Metempsycosis
of the Pythagorists were

reuiued, and the soule of
Iohn Duns Scotus were entred
into the bodyes of suruiuing
schollers, to trouble
the world with nicities, and
to lose themselues in miserable
extrauagant wandrings.
It was a good rule therefore
that Irenaeus gaue, That we
should diligently heede
neuer to bee transported
beyond the limits of Doctrinall
Principles, which
indeede is a glosse of that of
the Apostle, Sapere ad sobrietatem.
The iolly Counceller
that learnedly argues
titles of land, pleas of debt,
dammages of clyent, & cause,
may hereby bee counselled to
call to minde what claime, or
challenge he hath to heauen,
what plea hee ought to make
for his owne debt, which hee

oweth to his Creator, and if
the damnage or wrong of his
Clyent were his owne, what
plea, what care, what diligence
would 
                  •
               e vse to redres
himselfe. The disturbed, yea
oft times the poore miserable
distracted Clyent, that is delayed,
crossed, encumbred,
snibbed, & many times ouerborne,
may herewithall endeuour
to qualifiè and settle his
wearyed and perplexed heart
and looke vp vnto the master
of requests in heauen, and to
referre his cause vnto the
Iudge of the world Christ Iesus
who iudgeth righteously.
And if his cause goe well
with him, yet hereby h
                  •
               e
may bee caused to remember
in what passe his case is with
God, and to know who it is

that lets a man see his desire
vpon his enemies.
            All what soeuer they be, if
they will be pleased to be aduised,
may herein see (as in
a viewe) what Creation is,
that tendeth to saluation. And
so to abandon from their holy
intentions all needelesse controuersies,
and fruitlesse contentions,
according to the reference
of the prefixed context.
            For the lamentable Controuersies
about Religious
Godlinesse,

               cate
in nature, that the studious
labours of any one
man (were he neuer so well
qualified) cannot sufficiently
(no not all the time of his
life) so much as enter

into all the ambiguous laborinths
thereof, much lesse bee
euer able to compose, or conclude
them. For it falleth out
in this kind, as it doth in the
quirks and quiddities of law
cases, and thats a thousand
pitties, for the more lawyers
retained oft times the more
suites, pleas, counter pleas, demurrers
in Law, and many other
such like quaint deuises
so the morewriting of controuersies,
the more subtil
                  •
               ies, euasions,
distinctions, personall
aspersions, mistakings
with all maleuolent stirrings,
and striuings to make good
either part. Such also hath
beene the rotten condition of
mankinde, that when one
hath once hatched, & brought
foorth neuer so absured an
opinion, yet he findeth wits

in the world ready to deuise
trickes and shifts by nice distinctions,
and doubt full differences
to mainetaine withall
possible glosses the absurdities,
and shadowes thereof.
Besides, if we consider the impossibilitie
of composing, and
reconciling the controuersies
of the setimes, by reason of the
auerse, and setled resistance
of the opponents, both foraine
and domestick, together with
the irreconciliable natures of
the things controuerted, and
questioned, and the little hope
of any meanes to bee expected
either from them that striue,
or from others their wellwishing
neighbours, or from
both to reconcile, and pacifie
the furiousrage of either partie,
wee may euen despayre of

expecting any certaine and
setled ende of these miseries,
vntill the Lord Iesus come
himselfe from heauen in his
second and most glorious aduent,
and Consume with the
spirit of his mouth all the
gaynesayers and impostors of
his sacred truth, and abolish
with brightnes of his comming
all the mistie fogges of
misperswasion and mis-beleefe.
            Doubtlesse therefore in
the meane while, the best,
and most assured way for vs
(that loue, and looke, and
long for Christs comming) to
finde rest to our distressed
soules amidst such perplexed
distractions and laborinths,
is, to haue recourse to the pillar
and foundation of all

Christian faith, the director
to heauen, which is the written
word of God, the one
and onely way to the word begotten,
wherein, many places
wee shall finde couched in
in few words the summe and
substance of all our hope, and
happinesse in Christ, both in
nature grace, and glory, and
that summe of Christianitie
in so compendious an abridgment
oft times reported, that
the shortest memorie may recount
it, and so playnely set
downe that the weakest capacitie
may conceiue it. Such
is this Scripture prefixed, in
which as in a running stream
in some place the Elephant
may swim for deepenes, and
in other the Lambe may wade
for shall ownesse.
            
               Leauing therfore behind vs
the hellish afronting of all
Godlinesse to the damned Athiest,
that sayth in his hart,
There is no God, which
some Achrists of Spaine (I
would they were not in England)
most Lucian-like, and
Iulian-like haue tearmes to
the griefe of many good harts
their Peccadillos, or little
sinne, and appropriating the
circular Diuinity of Temporizers-who
goe in a Maze
to painted Hypocrites, Who
are euer learning, and neuer
come to the acknowledgement
of the Trueth,
because they feele not the
power thereof, nor endeauour
to practise it together with
all, neutralizing staggerers,
and Cassandrian Courtiers,
who neyther cleaue to God,

nor to Baal, but are like
Ephraim, a cake on the
harth not turned, which
needes must be dough on the
one side, and burnt on the
other, hote in their singed
zeale, and lue warm in their
fringed hypocrisie, & lastly,
abandoning from vs all nouell
sectaries, who eyther
with the 
                  •
               nostiques and Donatists
challenge to themselus
an impropriation of all reformed
doctrine and discipline,
or with the Cathari
boast of a Monopolie of perfect
sincerity, or with the rare
illuminates of the world, the
Iesuites, Iesuini, Scofiotti,
Presbyteri, Sanctae
Luciae, Reformati, Sacerdotes,
or by what other
titular denominations soeuer
they bee tearmed, who

vndertake to haue the onely
direction for all Christendome,
in ordine ad Deum,
or with the Capucini, who
aspire the onely mortification
(forsooth) in a patched Capouch,
and with them vtterly
forsaking all other rabbles,
and swarmes of monasticall,
and secular nominals, who
neglect the truth, and the
light thereof, Let vs flie
homeward with the distressed
doue into the Arke, which
is the holy Scriptures to saue
our selues from the general
deluge and cataclisme of ambiguities,
questions and ouerflowings
of vngodlinesse,
which assault vs here in this
life, the Ocean and sea of sorrow,
and hide from vs the
brightnesse of Iesus Christ,
with the mists of impietie,

and fogs of vanity.
            And let vs call to minde
that all vnderstanding in
Godlinesse is eyther Opnion
Faith, or perfect Knowledge.
            Opinion beeing like the
Twilight, neyther certaine▪
nor euident. Faith, as the
dawning, certaine but not
euident and perfect.
            Knowledge as the Sunneshine
both certaine and euident.
            Opinion beeing the
Conduite pipe of all controuersies,
the mother of heresies,
the seede of schisme, and
the heade of a Foxe, and
perfect knowledge, onely proper
to our triumphant and
glorious estate in Heauen:
wee must here in this Life
walke by faith. This faith

must haue a foundation to
build vpon, Whats that?
must it bee built on the
Church? thats to generall: so
the Sarazens, or Hagarens
rather (as Zozomene obserued
a thousand yeares agoe,
haue their Masters. Vppon
the Fathers? thats too
rusticall, so the Iewes haue
their Rabbins. Vpon the
Pope, thats too Phythagorical?
so the Gentiles had their Philosophers
of their seuerall
sects, Vpon suddaine and
fancifull reuelations, thats
meerely Anabaptisticall, God
in an engine. Vpon what
then? Euangelical Esay
the Lordes Prophet tels vs,
That our faith must bee
founded vppon Gods Oracle
the Scriptures, and Christ

the sonne of God biddes vs
Search the Scriptures, and
Saint Peter a chiefe pillar
of the Church, sayeth, Wee
shall doe well to heede
that certaine end of Prophesie,
as vnto a light
that shineth in a darkplace
vntill the day dawne, and
the day starre arise in our
hearts.
            
            But stay, who then
shalbe iudge of the scripture?
that our faith may bee setled
with iudgement: for as
much as most Heretikes auouch
scripture.
            Shall Christians iudge
betweene Christians in cases
of controuersie? no they are
too partiall, because they are
parties. Shal Pagans? no, they
are not capable of holy mysteries,
shall Iewes? no they are

enemies of Christ. What then?
Shall wee knocke at heauen
gates, that Christ Iesus may
come downe and decide these
doubts, What neede that? Wee
haue him in the Gospell, sayth
Cyprian, wherein if we exercise
our selues diligently by
conferring scripture with
scripture, and expounding
according to the Analogie,
and rule of our faith, beeing
guided by the iudgement of
holy reformed Church, which
acknowledgeth no other guid,
but onely the Euangelicall
and Apostolicall writings,
nor any other rocke to builde
vpon but Iesus Christ, nor any
other City of refuge, to flie
vnto then the word of God,
which as Dauid sayth, is a
Lampe vnto our pathes for
our liues & a light, as S. Peter

sayth, in darkenesse for our
knowledge, a ballance for our
decision, to weigh the light
from the ponderous, sayth S.
Augustine, a touch stone for
our tryall, as sayth S. Chrysostom,
to discern the currēt
from the counterfeite, and in
a word as Constantine in
the Nicene counsell, sayde of
all sufficiencie for our ful satisfaction,
and the onely deuoyment
of all controuersies
for our resolution wee shall
doe well. This being added,
that we pray earnestly with
Dauid, That God would
open our eies that we may
see the wōders of his Law,
Otherwise, they that are conceyted
in their owne singularity,
and priuat spirite, either
for doctrine of faith, or direction
for manners. Sathan

stands at their right hand,
and the thinges that
should haue beene for
their good, are occasion
of their falling.
            
            These thinges beeing so,
what meanes the cursed malignants
of our Church of
England to trouble mens
mindes with niceties, the
breeders of controuersies,
whence many monsters of opinion,
and thousand of fancies
doe dayly arise, which
entangle the simple in many
wofull Laborinthes, as to demaund
of vnsetled soules,
where was your Church hid
vntill of late, some hundred
yeares since? What Emperor
raigned when it came forth?
or on what day was it hatched?
What age did the Religion
you professe, arise in?

What is become of our Forefathers?
These and the like
interrogatories are as introductions
and preambles to
insnare and entangle the simple
with needlesse questions,
and quiddities. As if Petrus
Valdus Lugdunensis, Iohn
Wicleefe, Husse, Luther,
and others such reformers,
did at any time endeauour to
beget, or set vppe a new
Church, whereas the truth
is, they onely diligently labored
by the word of God, and
by the power thereof, to reforme
that Church, which by
mens traditions and deuizes,
was most miserably deformed
and defaced, and to
reduce it to its former splendor,
and integrity. Alwayes
saluting that church, though
much deformed by the louing

Sister. And doubtlesse wee
know many pious and chaste
Matrones, who iustly may be
ashamed of their owne sisters
enormious courses, and exorbitant
conditions. Neyther
did they vse any other means
in seeking reformation, but
by yeelding onely, and lamenting
sayd, Oh how is that
faithfull City become an
harlot? It was full of iudgement,
and iustice lodged
therein, but now they are
murtherers. Thy siluer, O
sister, is become drosse, thy
wine is mixed with water:
For these and the like important
consideratiōs of the great
defect, miserable reuolt, and
dāgerous obliquities of those
times they had learned Apostolicall
counsel, To haue no
fellowship with such doings,

but to reproue them
rather. Were these and their
followers then to bee accounted
enemies, and to be scornefully
branded with the names
of Waldenses, Wicklefiās,
Hussites, Lutherans, and
other the like disgracefull
tearmes, as if they had beene
Nouelists, because they tolde
the truth, God forbidde?
George Cassander the
choyce diuine of his time said
well and iuditiously, when he
gaue his sentence of the dissentions
of the Church, both
to Ferdinand and Maximilian
the Emperours, acknowledging
that in the beginning
many were iustly stirred vp
by a godly zeale, earnestly to
reproue, and reforme some
apparāt abuses in the church,
and that the principall cause

of the Churches calamity,
and distraction, was not to
bee imputed to those who
sought reformation, but rather
to such as ruled the stern,
who beeing puffed vp with
disdaine, and scorned to be
rebuked, proudly, and peremptorily
despised, and disdayned
those that modestly,
meekely, and iustly did but
admonish and aduertise
them.
            And hee thought that
there could bee no firme, nor
constant concord in the
Church, vnlesse they beeganne
to reforme, who
first gaue the occasion of
distraction, to witte, that
those of the Churches Gouernement
must abate theyr
rough rigor and sternnes, &

yeeld somewhat for the peace
of the church, and by listening
to the petitions, and
counsels of many godly and
well disposed men, should reforme
the apparent errors
and abuses crept into the
church, and conforme them
according to the rule of Gods
word and the primitiue
integritie from which they
were in many things declined.
            If the case were come to
this, who would not embrace
that sacred peace of the
church wherewith the angells
of heauen congratulated
mankinde in the incarnation
which Christ left
as his legacie to his peculiar
people when hee was to

forsake the world, and the
Apostles as their principall
doctrine enioyned to the
Christian Church.
            Euery one (you say) is
ready for peace, but what if
we cannot haue it? Then
must we make peace as
Saint Iames speaks) by our
diligence, by our sufferance.
What if wee make peace once,
and it depart? Then must
wee follow peace (as Paule
commands.) What if it abandon
vs (Peter wisheth
vs) to seeke it, and ensue it.
What if it will not come? (as
Abrahams seruant sayde of
Rebecca) after wee haue
sought it and ensued it? Surely
then must wee studie to bee
quiet.
            For what good Christian

is not of worthy Constantines
minde, who desired of
God to passe his dayes free
from trouble and vexation.
And of Iouians who sayd this
by chance, touching a queroulous
libel of the Macedonians,
I hate contentions
and strife, and those that are
giuen to peace and concord, I
deerely loue and reuerence.
            Oh what hellish furie hath
enraged the malignant
Church to stirre vp strife,
and controuersie against vs,
not onely all the day long, but
euen for time, and times, euen
many ages. The Arrians and
Circumcellians neuer more
raged against the Orthodoxe,
then Rome hath against
vs.
            For beholde and see, if

there were any damnable heresie
of olde wherewith they
haue not endeuoured by all
the wit and strength of skill
they could to brand vs withall,
which is all the issue (for
ought I can see) of all these
controuersies.
            They tearming vs Simonians,
for once mentioning
of grace, and saluation, Eunomians,
and Pepusians,
for attributing (as they say)
too much vnto faith, & to woman
                  •
               for
that a woman was
our dread Soueraigne. Originists,
and Proclians for
teaching that the Image of
God by sin is extinctin man,
and that the fume of concupiscence
is not vtterly extinct.
            
               Sabellians, Eutichians,

Swinkefeldians, yet let the
indifferent reader iudge whether
wee partake in one iota
with these heretickes? They
terms vs Donatists; for admitting
the iust onely into the
elect Church of God, Mani
                     •
                  chees,
for abandoning all
free will in our selues to
worke well of our selues.
            
               Arrians, for neglecting humane
traditions. Nouatians
for refusing Popish penance.
Aetians, for omitting oblations,
and feasts for the
dead. Iouianists, for casheering
a slippery and perplexed
faith. Vigilantians for not
admitting the adoration of
reliques. Nestorians for not
keeping the consecrated hosts.
Xenaits, for abolishing Images.
Lampetians for putting

from vs the bondage of vowes
and indeede what not? to
to make vp a bead-rowle of
rablement against. vs.
            Thus they do fat & please
themselues with these, and the
like as persions of slander, and
reproch, as if they had vowed
neuer to sacrifice vnto their
Idoll Iupiter Latialis, Papa
Turcissimus, but as the Lindians
did to Hercules with
curfning, and raylings. Thus
the tongues of our aduersaries
who hate peace, hath bin
a furnace to refine vs in.
            Besides many cart loades
of Pamphlets frought with
these and the like obliques,
what riuers of bloud: what
burnings, both of the liuing
and of the dead, hath the
Christian Catholicke world

in these dissentions of that
bloudy and Antichristian Synagogue,
bot
                  •
                by wofull experience
knowne, and by barbarous
crueltie endured. And
haue they (thinke you) who
haue beene neuteralizing sequestrators
taking part on
no side, but standing by, and
looking on, endeuouring
onely a Cassandrian pacification,
haue they (I say) escaped
their virulencie? Let
Cassander himself, Fricius,
the Adiaphorists, Interimists,
and the nameles Apologists
of France, who haue
sought peace and an end of
controuersies, tell if it hath
not happened vnto them amidst
these garboyls, as it did
vnto the foolish shepheard,
that interposed himselfe betweene

two rammes furiously
raging, and running with all
might and violence the one
at the other. Neither suffiseth
it to compose these controuersies
that wee admit
as absolute Catholickes,
the whole sacred booke of
God, the three Catholike Symboles
or Creedes, to wit, that
of the Apostles, that of Athanasius
and that of Nice,
euē in the very leturgy of our
Church together with all the
holy diuinity cōprized in the
fower first generall cousels,
vnlesse wee also receiue from
thē Transsubstantiatiō, Purgatorie,
and the Popes transcendent
supremacy, with all
other nouelties hatched from
the Conuenticle of Trent, in
this dotage of the world,

which strange proiects were
then deuised, that the holy
Fathers of Italie might no
way bee inferiour to the Apostles,
nor the Pope of Rome,
to Christ Iesus himselfe.
            The fire of God sayth Basil
affoordeth light without burning,
but hell fire burneth
without light. Hell fire therefore
is the portion for those
that despise the glorious
light of Gods truth, and desire
like the Salamander to
noozell themselues in the
flames of furious contentions,
and continuall contro

            But without controuersie
sayth the Context, Great is
the Mystery of Godlinesse.
And confest it is on al hands
that vnles we beleeue the Catholike

faith we cannot be saued: a
summe whereof is this modell
of Scripture prefixed.
            Let vs therfore be wise now
at the last to lay aside all distracting
controuersies both
transmarine and domesticke
and let vs studie to bee quiet,
For wee see by many wofull
experiences what is the miserable
issue of calling in question

               thes.
            And how at the first this
hellish fire of Contention may
be more easily put out, before
it breake foorth into such
scorching flames, as now in fest
the Church of God in West
Frizeland.

the Psalmist speaketh.
            Shall not wee detest that

which hindereth true and

Scriptures, that rayseth sects,
that giues offence to weake
ones, and doth vtterly dash

The ignorance also
of many thousand who vnderstand
not the things controuerted,
no not their names

admonish vs to bee wise, at
the last lest they of Gath and
Askalon laugh at our singular

            Besides the wounding of
our owne consciences in such
garboyles by hindering ofSit procul a Christi discordia saeua ministris, Namque Deus poterit non nisi pace coli. Nullalues ouibus tantum, non vlla venena, Quantum pastorum dissidia ipsa nocent. Phil. Melanct▪ in Epigram.
our prayers and Preachings
in the worke of Christs ministerie
bids vs beware (if euer
we will bee warned) of
such scandalous courses. For
how can we preach peace, or
perswade mutuall reconciliation
betweene others, when
wee our selues are the firebrands
of contention to stir
vp the coales of factions and
sidings among the poore ignorants.
And whiles one says
he is Pauls, another sayes he

Let vs therefore neuer listen

            EXPLICATION.
            
               GReat is the
misery of
mankind,The Lords day Rom. 5.

sinne; and also by actuall
transgressions of thought,
word, and deed, whereby
man becommeth more and
more euery day the miserable
bondslaue of Sath
                     ••
                  . A
figure of this wofull estate
was represented vnto vs in

the twofold bondage of
Gods Children,Exod. 
                     •
                  . the people
of Israel,
               2▪ Reg. 23. the one in the slauery
of Egypt, the other, in
the captiuity of Babylon. Into
the first; the Israelites were
plunged in the pers
                  •
                of their
Ancestors, in whose loynes
they discended into Egypt, &
were thereby subiected to the
crueltie of Pharaohs tyranny,
and needed a deliuery to rid
them thence. Into the second,
their own actuall fresh
bleeding sinnes cast them, for
thereby they prouoked God
to wrath, who in his iust
iudgement deliuered them
to the rage and force of their
enemies, who led them away
Captiue; and in that wretched
estate had they remayned,
if they had not also from
them beene graciously deliuered.
            Semblable was the wofull
estate of Mankind, had not

Iesus Christ the eternall Son
of God deliuered vs both
from the one and the other.
This deliuerance of Mankind,
from out this wofull
and lamentable condition,
whereunto wee were plunged
in the loines of Adam originally,
and by our owne
sinnes actually, is the greatest
mysterie that euer the world
knew, and is therefore called
the Great mysterie of Godlines.
For wee beeing now deliuered
by the life and death of
Christ Iesus, from this originall
attainder of high treason,
and by holy grace purchased
by the power of his
Passion, Resurrection, and ascension,
beeing restored to
our bloud, and freed from
the rule, raigne, and rage
of sinne, this great misery of
mankind, is turned into a
great mysterie of Godlines;
and wee once wretches, and

miserable miscreants, are
now become good, godly,
and a choice company of holy
ones.
            This mystery the
                  •
               efore is
called the mysterie of Gods
will; for it is Gods will wee
should bee good.2 Thes. 4, 3: 
               This is the
will of God,Col. 1: euen your Sanctification.
               Act. 15,
Sometimes it is called
the mysterie of faith, as
the meanes of becomming
good; for our hearts are purified
by faith; otherwise it is
a mistie, and misled faith, that
bringeth not forth goodnes.
And here it is called the
Great Mysterie, as the ende
of our godly profession,
which is the greatest blessing
that euer could come to
man, which is our Vnion
with God in Christ, and thereby
life euerl
                     •
                  sting. And assuredly,
this Vnion with Christ, can
neuer bee obtained but by
godlines, without the which,

no man shall see God.
            Great then is this mystery,Heb. 12.
for the Reuelation of this
openeth vnto vs all other
mysteries, and therefore it is
Great.
            
            It sheweth vnto vs the
mystery of the great WhoreApoc. 17.
the mysterie of iniquitie, (euen
the historie of the Papacie
as noble and▪ memorable
Philip Morney stiles it) which
misguideth so many thousand
soules, and plungeth
them into the misery of error
and vngodlinesse, euen
into the deepe darkenesse of
Sathan,Apoc. 2. lewdnesse of life, and
finall despaire in death. It
sheweth also vnto vs the mystery
of the last day, which is
that, Wee shall not all dye, but
wee shall bee all changed,
               1 Cor. 15. 
               and
that in a moment, in the twinckling
of an eye, by Gods last trumpet.
            
            
               Godlinesse then is a mysterie?

yea surely, for it is an
hidden and vnknowne secret
to the wise and prudent,
that is, to those that thinke
themselues wise and are not,
and it is a reuealed & known
mysterie to babes, and sucklings:
that is,Mat, 18. to those that as
little children subiect and
submit themselues to the
wise and learned in God. For
he that wil be somwhat with
God, must be nothing in him
self;Gal. 6, for, He that thinketh himselfe
somewhat, when he is nothing,
he deceiueth himselfe.
            
            
               Godlinesse is a mysterie, because
it hath beene hid with
God from the worlds foundation,
who they are that in
time should be godly, and
should come to the true
knowledge of this mysterie.
And it is a mysterie, because
it was not made knowne to
some ages of the world in full
reuelation, but was reserued

for the glory and greatnesse
thereof vnto the last times, euen
vntill the reuelation of
Iesus, that the Sonne of God,
whose pretious bloudshedding
hath made so many holy
ones,Sancti ceu sanguine tincti. in the sight of God
the Father. And lastly, it is a
mysterie, for that it is euen
yet hid in Gods iust iudgement,
to them that are lost,
               2. Cor. 4. 
               in
whom the god of this world hath
blinded the minds of them that
beleeue not, l
                     •
                  st the light of the
glorious Gospell of Christ, who
is the image of God, should shine
vnto them.
            
            This sacred mysterie is also
called Great, both in respect
of the matter thereof,
which is maruellous, and in
respect of the manner which
is miraculous. The matter
maruellous, that we for lorne
wretches, and dust creeping
wormes, blinded in our own
vnderstandings, hardned in

our hearts, and infected in
our affections, should euer
become coheires with Christ
the Sonne of God, taken out
as a remnant from among all
other creatures; which God
seemed to passe ouer, and to
neglect, in respect of vs, for
God hath not communicated
this mysterie in such neernesse,
no not to the blessed
Angels: for, To which of the
Angels sayde God at any time,
Sit on my right hand,
               Heb▪ 1. 
               vntill I
make thine enemies 
                     •
                  hy footestoole.
            
            The manner miraculous,
that flesh
                  •
                and bloud should
become such holy seruants,
enlightned in their vnderstandings,
mollified in their
hearts, reformed in all their
desires, yea sanctified
throughout, both in spirit, &
soule, and body, and should
become such resolute souldiers
in Gods battels, vpon

such hard tearmes of intertainement
as were proclaymed
by Christ to his followers,
beeing conditions so offensiue,
and contrariant to
the nice nature of men and
women: which were, That if
they followed Christ, and would
liue godly in this present world,
               2 Tim. 3.
               they should suffer persecution:
they should be hated of all men,
               Mat. 10.
               they should be whipped and murthered,Luc▪ 6.
yea they should fare as
Lambes among Wolues. In a
word, their swords of Reuenge,
must be euer words of
Grace and Edification; their
fightings, patience; their
wealth, ofttimes greeuous
want; their feasting, fasting;
their whole life very miserable
in respect of others, they
being abridged of many outward
things, and their ende,
(in the sight of men) ofttimes
most lamentable.
            
               Great, therefore doubtlesse

is this mystery of godlinesse,
which (for all these hard conditions,
or whatsoeuer heresie,
schisme, apostasie, the
world, the flesh, or the diuell,
could doe to crosse it) discerneth
truth from falsehood by
Euangelicall reuelation, the
effect of Preaching, and by
doctrine the effect of knowledge,
which Saint Angustine
calleth Christian Doctrine, &
by the patient sufferings of
Gods Saints in the bloudie
butcheries and persecution
of the Christian Church.
            
               Great is the mysterie of
godlinesse,Ioh▪ 1. yea so Great, that
God became man, and man became
God, that this God-man
was manifested in the flesh,
so great was it, that it was iustified
by the spirit, both of

of vncleane persons to become

and sensuall miscreants,
to become fast and faithfull

that it is miraculous, for in
despight of Sathan, and all
the powers of darkenesse, it
worketh miraculous effects

in our weake and feeble natures.

whatsoeuer else dependeth
thereon. For the Antiquitie of
this godlinesse is the Ancient
of dayes, and wee may easily

answer all our opposits brags
of Antiquitie with this, It was
not so from the beginning. The

Paul, and Saint Peter, and

This is a mysterie indeede,
and a great mysterie,
and more then that, the mysterie
of Godlinesse, not the
curious querees of mans vain
greatnesse, to wit, the secret
mysteries of nature, either of
the firmamentarie orelementarie
world, for abstruse
knowledge we leaue to Aristotle,
Lemnius, Cardanus,
Cornelius Agrippa, Albert us,
Auerhoes, Trismegistus & such
like, the searchers & inquisitors
of natures niceties, the
end whereof (for the most
part) is vaine Phylosophy, &

they that spend their dayes in
such triflings, eyther fayle of
this happy end to bee Godly,
like those that seeke with the
expence of witte, and wealth
the Elixar of the Philosophers
stone (the Worlds
woodcocke) or fal away from
God in Astrologicall calculations,
with the curious,
Chaldeans, and Egyptians.
            But this Godlinesse is the
Great Riches; for albeit it hath
nothing of the World;
               2. Tim. 6. yet it
possesseth all the thinges of
God. Thats a mysterie indeed.
It dignifieth vs with
the grace of Sanctification aboue
our wretched nature,
and diefieth vs with the happinesse
of Glorification aboue
the visible Heauens. That is
a great mysterie.
            It is the salt of the earth
seasoning vs, and all the acts
wee doe, that we, and they
may bee rationall sacrifices,

acceptable to God in Christ:
yea, and it is the fauour of
Heauen, breathing into vs the
breath of eternall life, whereby
wee are made partakers
of the Diuine nature,
               2 Pet. 1. in beleeuing
on God in this Worlde,
and in louing him shall liue
for euer in the other world.
            This Godlines must needs
be great, when the great God
by his holy Spirit is the worker
thereof; for who can repaire
the ruines of our rotten
and corrupt nature, but the
God of nature? Hee it is
who onely can take away
the stony heart, and giue vs
a fleshie, plyable, and penitent
heart, that onelie can rid
vs out of sathans snares &2 Tim. 2. restore
vs to a sound mind.
            Great is this Godlinesse, seing
nothing could moue God to
doe this for vs, but his owne
great loue to mankind,Iohn 3. and
the death and Resurrection

of that great Prophet Christ
Iesus the Sonne of God. Great
in respect of the means,Act. 7, wherby
God conuayed this Godlinesse
vnto vs, for the faith of
this Godlines conuerteth vs by
the doctrine of the Law to
know our selues, & our sins,
by the preaching of the Gospell,
to know our selues in
Christ Iesus to bee saued, and
oft times by afflictions, wee
are weaned from the World,
and are made to take liking
of God and godlines.
            
            So wee see that in the first
act of our becomming good,
wee are meerely passiue; for
what can a dead man doe to
quicken himselfe, and wee
were all dead in sinnes, and
trespasses;Eph. 2▪
                but after wee are
thus quickned by Gods acte,
wee know that we are aliue,
and reioyce in our godly wel
doings. At the first, to worke
this great 
                  〈◊〉
               ,1 Cor. 15. the grace

of God is in vs, but when we
once feele this sacred power
wee are willingly ledde on
to goodnes, for the grace of
God is with vs; yet in all
this wee haue here no absolute
perfection, but expect
the consummation thereof in
glory. Tell mee then (Beloued
in the Lord) is not this

the Great Mysterie of Godlinesse,

children, prescribeth them

promiseth them Heauen, and
they are sure of it. Is not this

                  , and excellent
that assureth them that know
it, that they are elected, is a
declaration to our selues and
others, that wee doe beleeue,
and is a performance of our
dutie in part: And lastly, is
not that Great, the end wherof

tendeth to the Conuersion
of vnbeleeuers,Luc. 22. who seeing
our good workes in this
profession of Godlines,
               Rom. 14. glorifie
our heauenly Father, and is
the confirmation, and setling
of our brethren that doe beleeue.
Oh sacred mysterie
of celestiall happines!
            Thrice happy are they therfore,Application
who vnderstand this
Mysterie of Godlinesse. For
Without controuersie (for
that is the preamble of this
Scripture) Great is the Mysterie
of Godlinesse, and such as
are of the generation of those
that seeke the Lord, will with
all diligence, modesty, sobriety,
meekenesse and peace,
search to know this Mysterie,
laying aside all contentions,
quarrels, strifes, and enuyings,
which distract, and disturbe
mens hearts, and hinder men
from beeing good. Let Godlines
be our Helena, and the

truth will assuredly appeare
vnto vs, as the learned Earle
of Mirand wrote to Hermolaus
Barbarus in this case. For
it seuereth from it all the He
                  •
               trogenean,
and mongrill
boastings of curious speculations,
the specious glitterings
of mans abstruse wisedome,
as humane traditions, fanatical
Enthusiasmes, and grosse commixtures
of Moses rites with
Christianisme.
            And they that know this
Mysterie of Godlines, lay aside
all spleanie Controuersies, &
seeke onely to know God,
& whom he hath sent, Christ
Iesus, whereby they shall find
themselues by the power
thereof changed from the fashions
of the World, the olde
man, the first Adam,
               1 Cor. 15. into the
blessings of the new man,Eph. 4.
Christ Iesus the second Adam,
that is clothed with righteousnesse
and grace.
            
               They shall find that Godlinesse
is the richest treasure,
yea to bee more excellent, &
more magnificent then all
Maiesty enriching them with
those blessings, that many
Kings and Monarches of the
earth could neuer attaine vnto.
Because Godlinesse shall
secure them f

               om all vexations
and incursions of the Diuell
whatsoeuer: for God
will tender them,Psal. 91. 11, Zach. 2, 
               As the apple
of his owne eye, and commaund
his Angels to pitch their tents
round about them. There is
the safety of this Godlinesse, euen
a wall of fire to keepe out
their enemies. Godlinesse shal
beautifie them, for they shall
be decked with Grace, whereby
God shall accept them. For
his people, his sonnes, and daughters
for his Spouse,
               Psal. 34. 
               and fer his
exceeding great delight:
               Cant. 3. There
is the grace of this Godlinesse,
euen the rayes of Sion.

Gods Register? And all things
shall worke together for their
good;
               Rom. 28. yea, euen their sinnes
(as Saint Augustine noteth)
There is the victory of this
Godlinesse, euen a glorious
conquest which many Kings
and Monarches neuer atchieued.
Godlinesse shal enlighten
their darkenesse, (as Saint Augustine
sayeth) For it is the
Mirrour of the purified s

be ignorant, Wee shall all bee
taught of God,

Tearchers shall surpasse, our
Ancients. There is the true

wisedome of this Godlinesse.

despaire. O how great is the goodnes
he hath layde vp for the that
trust in him euen before the sons
of men. There is the fauour of
this Godlinesse.
            
            The voyce of ioy and gladnes
is in the dwellings of the righteous.

of this Godlinesse.

sayd,Mat. 
                     •
                  7. 
               It is good being here maister.
Indeede there is no good
being any where else. For holinesse
becommeth his house for
euer. For what euill can come
vnto vs,Ca

                  t. 2. when Gods left hand
is vnder our head, and his right
hand doth embrace vs. There
is the protection of this Godlinesse.
            
            This Mysterie of godlinesse
quieteth the distresses of conscience.Prou. 14.
The godly man is as
confident as a Lion,
               Pro. 30. 
               for the name
of the Lord is his strong tower,

he runneth vnto it and is safe.
There is the securitie of this
godlinesse. Not carnall securitie,
such as the custome of the
world, and the vse of sinne
doth oftimes besot, aud infatuate
the hearts of Worldlings
withall. For vnlesse I were
Cleane either indeede, or in
desire or indeuour, I should
suspect the feare of God had
neuer once come into my
heart, how soeuer the subtiltie
of Sathan and sinne had secured
me,Psal. 19. for the feare of the
Lord is cleane.
            
            But when a Christian feeles
in himselfe first Aversion from
euil, whereby he hateth sinne,
and of that hatred a double
sorrow to proceede: One of
the world working death,
when wee are plunged in deuouring
feares and sorrowes,2. Cor. 7. through the sight of our sin,Eph. 4.
and an apprehension of Gods
iust iudgements for the same,

by the rigour of the Law, the
other a godly sorrow, working
repentance by the spirit
of adoption,Rom. 8. and deliuering vs
from the spirit of bondage to
feare any more, wee are not
idle, or luld in securitie, but
straightway wee fall to crie
Father, and labor after a most
godly sort, to rest in this so
holy a resolution. By carefulnesse
to looke more warily to
our wayes,
                  
                     •
                  . Cor. 7. 11 by cleering of our
selues to keepe a good conscience
in all things, by indignation
to disdaine euer to bee
brought againe vnto the former
slauery of Sathan, by
Feare to dash out all relapses,

be worse thē our beginnings,
by vehement desire to set our
affections aboue, by zeale to

impotently, and foolishly,

seeke, and search after in this
world.
            And hauing thus approued
our selues, that we are turned
from the euill in a true detestation
thereof, wee go on in
our conuersion to the good
which is the other part of our
Godlines, euen the quickning
of our spirits by Gods grace,
by illumination of our minds
in the sight of those things
which leade vs on to heauen,
by renouation of our minds, in
the obedience of our once sullen
and froward hearts, but
now plyable and penitentiall
hearts to Gods counsell, by
reformation of all our disordered
affections, in setling them
to the minde, and thinke of
nothing but whatsoeuer
things are True,
               Phil. 4. 
               honest, iust,
pure, louely, of good report, of vertue,
or of praise which wee haue
learned, receiued, and seene in

Gods children, these things they
thinke on, and doe, that are
the Lords.
            Indeed hypocrites, and the
reprobate are sayde in ScriptureHeb. 6. 4. 10. 29.
to be sanctified in respect
of their outward calling, and
in their partaking of the externall
preaching of the word
and Sacraments receiued, but
the godly onely who are inwardly
renued by the power
of the Spirit haue this s
                  •
               nctifying
grace to expell all full
consent from their hearts to
offend God, and to labour &
striue after righteousnesse.
            Yet whiles the godliest liue
in this world they cannot attaine
to a full expulsion of the
euill, and introduction of the
good▪ but these two remaine
like to opposite parties in a
pittched field combating,Gal. 5. and
skirmishing the one with the
other, that the most holy cannot
do what they would.
            And as in the twilight, or

dawning of the day, the light
that we see is not vtterly voided
of darknesse neither
is the darkenesse altogether
without light, and as in warm
water the heate is mixed with
cold; so the reluctations of
the flesh and spirit that the
godly haue in this world,
haue no fellowship the one
with the other, no more then
those different qualities, yet
they may remaine in one subiect,
either acting his owne
part, not seuerally, albeit distinctlie.
Sarah the wife of Abraham
is a president in this
kinde, who beleeued the promise
of God made vnto her
concerning her issue, being
moued thereunto by the holy
Ghost, yet being impatient
of delay, enforced thereunto
by the flesh, shee giues her
mayde vnto her husband, so
that one and the same worke
euen in the deerest of Gods

children, may in respect of
the spirit be praise worthy, &
in respect of the flesh bee
blameable. Sanctification in it
selfe is most perfect, but when
it is considered in the man
that is sanctified, it is imperfect,
and varies by degrees,
and encreases by reason of
the dayly slips, and slidings of
the best, whereby their goodnesse
is ofttimes greatly hindered,
and neuer in this life
perfected, which is the reason
that the Scripture calleth this
our Godlinesse, sometimes a
pledge of the spirit, to assure
vs Gods fauour, and somtimes
an earnest, which is to be made
vp, neuer to be taken away. So
that wee see this God

whereas the vnregenerate
haue formes and fruites also

fruites are like those Apples

of the dead Sea, or Asphaltique

inside and you shall see nothing
but earthlynesse, sensualitie,
and diuellishnesse.
            But those that haue this
name of Godlinesse written
in their hearts by the finger
of God, are iustified
by their faith, and this Godlinesse
is a fragrant flower,
and holy fruite of that their
holy faith.
            Thy euer looking after
the sequell of this Holines,
which is Happinesse, reserued
for them in the heauens,

his children by this way
of Holinesse to the life of Happinesse,
               
there being great difference
betwixt the Way that
leadeth vnto the kingdome
of heauen, and the cause of
our attaining both the way,
and eternall life, which is the
gift of God through Iesus
Christ our Lord. What now
can disturbe or distract the
peace of Gods holy ones, seeing
they haue such pledges,
assurances, and earnests of
Gods fauour; that they shall
neuer vtterly faile, or fall away
from God. Oh this blessed
securitie, and happy peace of
conscience Is more to bee
desired then gold,
               Psal. 19. 
               yea then much
fine gold, sweeter also then
the honey, and the honey
Combe, called of the most
wise, the Continuall Feast.
There is their absolute contentment

Thus Godlinesse benefiteth vs
in this life, and blesseth also
in our death, yea after

death.Psal. 11.

For most men desire to know
the mysterie how to be great;
but few desire to know how
to bee good. Machiauels

to God, because they are not
reall, hatefull to the World,
because they are religious, albeit
they be but in shew, and
hurtfull to themselues, because
they are hypocrites, and deceyue
themselues with seeming
Godlinesse: These are
such as are misled with the
mysterie of iniquity; such a
one was Pope Paul the third,
who at his end, sayde. Now
shall I know three things,
whereof I doubted all my
life; to witte, whether there
bee a God; or Hel, or whether
the soule be immortall, (O
damned Infidell!) Such
another was Leo the te

The doctrines that pleaseth

those that are thus misled
with the mystreie of iniquity,
are traditions, amphibolous
equiuocations, mentall

Their Religion is policy,
their faith eyther implicite, or
wauering; like that of Lucius
consisting of words or wonders,
with Moses Egyptius,
as Ruffinus recordeth, would
not admit of, nor endure, that
Lucius should lay his handes
vpon him, but tolde him, that
hee would rather beleeue his
eyes then his eares; that is,
he would rather embrace the
Religion which is seene, then
that which is only heard. And
for them that without blushing

that are lost, in whom the God of
this world hath blinded the eyes
of them that beleeue not, lest the
light of the glorious Gospell of
Chrict, who is the Image of
God should shine vnto them: For
to these it is euen yet a hidden
mysterie; And in such fearefull
case are all light headed
Zebuls, scoffing Iebusites,
scorning Cains, vile Iulianists,
impious Lucianists, and contemners
of all piety, religion,
and godlinesse: But Beleeuers
consider, That the vngodly
shall bee turned into hell,
               Psal. 9.
               and all the Nations that know
not god,
               Rom. 9. and the whole creation

on groneth to bee deliuered
from such burthens as these
miscreāts are,Heb. 10. 
               Who tread vnder
foot the son of God, and account
the bloud of the new testament as
an vnholy thing, whereby they
are sanctified, and do despite the
spirit of grace. And Beleeuers
see euen by the ve
                  •
               y glimpse
of right reason, that nothing
but man maketh account of
greatnes, God doth not, for
with him is no respect of persons;Act. 10.
Nature doth not, for the
children of Princes are borne

and death assayleth the Court
as well as the cart. Goodnes
onely is that wherein
God delighteth, and good
men tender it as their breath:
Godlinesse beeing the gracious
mother, and goodnesse
the holy daughter.
            Lastly, they that beleeue,
know that godlinesse hath
the promise of this Life, to be

gracious in Christ, and of
that to come, to bee glorious
in Christ, and therefore it is

            GOD MANIFEsted
in the Flesh.
            Explication.
            GOD is the height of this
Mysterie,2 The first day of the weeke. 
               God in the flesh,
is the depth of this Mysterie,
God manifested in the flesh, is
the length and breadth of this
Mysterie. Of God it is reuealed
that hee is one in nature,
and three in persons, Father,
Sonne, and holy Ghost,
that is a Trinitie in Vnitie, &
an Vnitie in Trinitie. Euen as
in the nūber of three are one
number, and yet three vnities,
in a triangle are three angles,
yet one figure, in the Sunne
are body, brightnesse, and
heate, yet one Sunne, in
the fire, light, flame, and
heate, yet the fire cannot bee

diuided, in the soule our memorie,
vnderstanding and
will, and yet one soule; all
these shewing, that three may
bee one, and one three. So
likewise in God, are three
persons, Father, Sonne,
and holy Ghost; and yet one
God, who is blessed for euermore:
For vnlesse I vnderstand
(when I heare the name
of God) that it is meant of the
holy and vndeuided Trinity,
wherby I am sau
                  •
               d, mine vnderstanding
shall content me
nothing.
            The supereminency of
which Mysticall Beeing of
God passeth mans vtterance,August. l. 7. cap. 4. de Trin.
and therefore wee can better
thinke, then speake of God.
Let vs not then be ouer curious
to search out this mysterie:
For God is ex
                     •
                  ellent,
               Iob. 6. 26. 
               and
wee know him not, (sayeth Elihu
in Iob) Our thoughts comprehend
him not,
               Ier 32. 19. sayeth Ieremie,

And his wayes are past finding
out (saith Saint Paul) These
secrets belong vnto the Lord our
God,
               Ro. 11. 33. 
               and the reuealed things
thereof belong vnto vs,Deut. 29. 29. and to our
children for euer. Let vs then
here content our selues with
a touch rather then with a
taste of this secret of the essence
and will of God: For
God the Father in himselfe is
the Fountaine of the Dei
                     •
                  ie,
which no curiositie can finde
out:Dyonys. Areopag. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  Epiph. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  Origén, Iust Mart 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                
               Perfection of himself, which
no man can comprehend:
God of himselfe, whom all adore,
and Life of himselfe, in
whom we all liue. God the
Sonne in himselfe is the very
engrauen forme of his Father,
in whom the whole Godhead
dwelleth bodily. And God
the holy Ghost, is in himselfe
the fulnesse of them both by
procession. God (I say) whose
power is all puissance, whose
sense is all knowledge, whose

essence is the principal good;
whose worke is euery good,
whose scites beneath al things
without substractiō, aboue all
things without elation, within
all things yet not included.
without all things yet not excluded:
aboue al things as president,
beneath all thinges as
sustinent, within all things as
cōplement, without all things
as comprehēdent. The first
mouer yet notmoued in local
scite, yet not circūscribed, ordering
al times, yet not changed,
in Essence infinite, incō
               prehensible
in Maiestie, in
goodnes soueraigne, in wisedom
wonderfull, in counsels
terrible, in iudgmēt righteous
in cogitations secret, in works
holy, in mercy rich, in promise
true, alwayes the same, eternal,
immortal, vnchangeable,
not to bee expressed by
speech, not conceyued by
thought, of whom al the Angels

of Heauen doe stand in
feare, whom all dominations
and thrones doe adore, at
whose presence all powers do
shake.
            God, I say, being thus of
himselfe, is also reuealed towards
vs to bee of power incomprehensible,
creating all
things by his owne power, ordering
all things by his owne
will, directing all things to his
owne ends of his owne good
pleasure: of wisedome vnsearchable,
by which hee
spreade the heauens,Psal. 103. diuided
the waters, & setled the earth;
for in wisdome hath he made
them all: of mercy vnspeakable,
by creating vs of nothing,
and by redeeming vs
when wee were worse then
nothing: And of iuslice vncontrouleable,
leauing no
good vnrecompensed, no euill
vnpunished.
            This then indeede is a surpassing

incomprehensible
mistery, that thus God should
bee manifested in our weake
flesh, that God and Man
should be in one person. And
that of the same God, the holy
Scripture should say, in respect
of this his manifestation
in the flesh:Luk 2. 
               The child increased
in wisedome and knowledge,
and in fauour with God and
man: And Emanuel, God
with vs, should say of himself,
The Father is greater then I:
And of the same God in respect
of his Dietie,Ioh. 14. he h
                  •
               mself
sayth;Ioh. 8. 
               Before Abraham was
borne, I am, and that hee was
the first begotten of euery Creature.
And further in respect
of the vnion of both natures
in the person of the Sonne of
God (the sacred word sayth)
That God redeemed his Church
with his bloud,
               Act. 2. That the Iewes
crucified the Lord of glorie▪
               1. Cor. 2. 
               and
that he gaue his life for vs:
               1. Ioh. 3. So

that the Catholike conclusion
of all, is this, That Christ Iesus
Emanuel consisting of two
distinct Natures in the person
of the Sonne of God, without
confusion was incarnate, and
became our Mediator, according
to both Natures, that the
same hand that wrought the
institutiō of the world, should
also worke the restitution of
the same: For it was impossible
that the World should be
saued without the Incarnation
of the Sonne of God: For
God in Christ reconciled the
world vnto himselfe: And by
taking vnto himself our flesh
by Incarnation, made it his
owne flesh, that so of his own
(albeit from vs) hee might
haue what to offer to God for
vs.
            And without this our
flesh hee could not suffer, for
the manhood is the proper
subiect of passion, compassion

and feeling pitty, which causeth
the regiment of Christes
Kingdome to bee most amiable,
exercising dominion ouer
all men, with a true, naturall
and sensible touch of
mercy▪
            
            The second person therefore
of the glorious Trinitie;
was sent to performe this
great worke: not the Father,
who being of none, could not
be sent: Not the holy Ghost,
who albeit he proceed, yet he
is not the first that proceedeth:
And forasmuch as a
double Mission was requisite,
the first person that proceedeth,
was fittest for the first
Mission, and the second for the
second, who also more fitte,
to make vs the sonnes of God
by grace, then hee that was
the sonne of God by nature:
And who more fit to repaire
the images decayed in vs, then
he that was the engrauē form

of his Fathers person. And
this was done that man with
more assurance, and without
danger of euer erring, might
come neare vnto the presence
of sacred truth it selfe, and settle
therein by this manifestation
of the Sonne of God.
And God became man, that
he whom man was to follow,
might shew himselfe vnto
man, and bee seene of him.
Besides it was done, that the
humane nature might be aduanced
to such an high dignitie
and excellencie, that no
man should any more so
much forget himselfe, as to
defile the same with sinfull
impurities. Lastly, it was done
that man might bee deliuered
from the slauery and bondage
of sinne, whereinto hee was
plunged; For man was punished
as Iustice vrged: That
was p
                  •
               rformed which God
had threatned, as Truth required

The offender was
pittied as Mercy entreated, &
God and Man reconciled, as
Peace desired. Thus Mercie
and Truth met together, Righteousnesse
and Peace kissed each
other.
            
            The manner of this is the
astonishment of Heauen, and
Earth; but our holy faith
makes it more true then plain
vnto vs; yet some resemblances
may in some part expresse
this vnion vnto vs.
            The vnion of soule and
body maketh one man a flaming
and fiery sword, makes
one sword one man may haue
two accidentall formes, Phisicke
and Law, and a branch
engraffed, and a tree is one
tree: so Christ is one, and yet
hath two different Natures, &
in them performeth the distinct
actions pe

of Dauid,
               Rom. 1. according to the
flesh, that is, according to the
weake flesh,Ioh. 1. 14. but not corrupted
flesh: For the Word was
made Flesh, and dwelt among
vs. There is the whole Nature
of man. And Christ in
the dayes of his flesh offered vp
prayers and supplications with
strong crying and teares vnto
him,
               Heb. 5. 7: 
               that was able to saue him
from death, and was heard in
that he feared. There is the
true affection of our nature:
So then,1 Iohn 4. 2. 
               He that confesseth that
Iesus is come in the flesh is of
God, and he that confesseth it not
is of the Diuell. There is the

triall of our faith. For this manifestation
of God in the flesh
is to vnbeleeuers as the cloud
that stood betwixt the Israelites
and the Egyptians at the
red sea, which to the Israelites
was a bright shining cloud,
but to the Egyptians a dark,
dangerous, and portentous
Commet.
            And is not this then a Great
Mysterie? That God, who
is without beginning and
end, should haue a beginning
with vs by birth, and an end
by death. That God who neither
changeth nor altereth,
should encrease in stature:
That God who is without
commixture or defect, should
eate and bee an hungry. That
God who could be no more
then he was, should take vpō
him the shape of a seruant, &
be that he was not, that could
haue no more then hee had,
should bee lesse then he was,

and could know no more thē
he knew, and yet would feele
our infirmities, and taste our
miseries. What tongue, what
pen can expresse this mysterie?
that God should bee vnited
vnto man, not onely in
loue & grace, but in one person:
for we must obserue that
the humane nature of Christ
is not a distinct person by it
selfe, as Peter, Iohn, and such
like, but to our vnspeakeable
comfort is so vnited to the
diuine nature that did assume
it, as they both make but one
person: so that all that is in it,
is truly said to be Gods, and al
that was don by it, to be done
by God, as Christs bloud was
Gods bloud, Christs death
was Gods death, as hath been
sayd. And the God of glorie
may as well be sayd to suffer
death, as to rayse the dead frō
their graues, and the sonne of
man as well to haue made, as

to haue redeemed the world.
            Who would euer haue
thought that so great a woūd
as mans sinneful defect from
God, should euer haue beene
thus healed? or that God, and
a wretched sinner should bee
thus reconciled, or that heauē
and earth should bee thus incorporated,
or that the veritie
of God,Ita celeberima illa concilia Nicenum contra Arrianum,

the like thing were knowne.
That a people should heare the
voyce of the Lord speaking out of
the middest of the fire. But
now we may pose Moses, &
say, O Moses, then God spake
by an Angell out of the middest
of the fire, but now (O
man of God) was euer the like
as this heard, That God himself
in the nature of man should sit amidst
his disciples and teach the.
               
This is that the spirit of God
so magnifieth. That at sundry
times, and in diuers manner God
spake heretofore in his Prophets,
               Heb, 1.
               but in these last dayes by his only
Sonne, And if the word deliuered
by an Angell was stedfast,

now speaking vnto them?
            
            O most ingratefull, and
brutish are the sonnes of men,
who seeke not to vnderstand
this mysterie so anciently prophesied
of, so fully performed,
and so manifestly declared.
Me thinkes I heare all
other creatures of heauen and
earth say. Oh that God had
vouchsafed vs such a blessing,
such a tie, such a fauour, for
then had wee had beene most
happy. The quires of Angels
say, Oh that God had
ordayned to vs so vnspeakeable
a fauour, as to haue beene
vnited to our nature. But

Christ tooke not vpon him the
nature of Angels, but tooke vpon
him the nature of children, that
being tempted himselfe, and suffering,

               hee might succour them
that suffer, and are tempted.
Who would not then in
consideration hereof giue
himselfe a whole burnt offering
vnto his God, and consecrate
his whole life (if the
terme thereof were euen from
the first Adam, vnto the ende
of the world) as a votiue seruice
vnto the glory of this
God. Oh vncircumcised

neither care to heare, nor to

seeke, they should find
that God would manifest

shold they be as those wretches
in whose flesh Sathan, and

are indeed incarnate diuels (as
the prouerb is) whom Sathan
hath so sifted to the bran, and
winnowed to the chaffe, that
no remainder of any godlinesse,

beginning and fountaine of

foolish imaginations & designes,

wanderings, in mine eares
by itching after vanities, in my

by impudent outfacings, in my
mouth by blasphemous swearings
and curses, and in my whole masse
of nature by lewde and loose conditions.

not raigne in my mortall body,
and Sathan that hee may not

but I had done the like, if thy

had not preuented mee, O Lord,
then let mee liue in thee, let mee
wholly resigne my selfe vnto thee
that neither sinne, nor Sathan,
nor shame, nor confusion may

that thou mayest dwell in mee

that hereafter I may obtain

            GOD IVSTIFIed
in the Spirit.
            Explication.
            
               GOD manifested in the
Spirit,
               3. The second day of the weeke. not as man iustified,
whose sinnes are remitted
for Christ his sake, whose
vnrighteousnesse is couered
with Christ his merits, whose
wretchednesse is not imputed
for Christ his obedience, as
Saint Augustine diuinely discanteth
vpon the 32 Psalme
but iustified in the spirit by
diuine iustice, such as is properly
to God only. In which
sence his iudgements are sayde
to bee iustified, that is, they
are true and righteous al
together, albeit to vs they
are secret and vnsearchable,
            
               
               His wisedome is sayde to bee
iustified of her children, that is,
it is knowne to bee true and
infallible wisdome.
            In this phrase spake Dauid
to God saying,Psal. 51. 
               That thou
mightest bee iustified when thou
speakest, and cleare when thou
iudgest, That is, that no liuing
creature could taxe, implead,
or touch the resolutions, and
performances of Gods decrees
with any the least preiudice
or impeachment of iniquitie,
for they were euer
most iust, and sacred; albeit
they are vnknowne to vs, Is
there any vnrighteousnesse
with God, sayeth Paul.
            
            In this phrase also Saint Peter
vrgeth the Iewes, that
they had denyed The holy one,
and inst,
               Act: 2. 
               and desired a murtherer
to be giuen them.
            
            The manner of this Iustification
was in the spirit, that
is to say; Hee was iustified in

that, which was in his
sacred person diuine, and aboue
the humane nature. So
S. Paul teacheth the Church
of Rome, affirming, that albeit
hee was the sonne of Dauid
according to the flesh, yet
was hee declared to bee the
Sonne of God, with power
according to the Spirit of sanctification,
               Rom. 1. 2.
               by the resurrection
from the dead, which seemeth
vnto mee to intend two arguments
to this purpose. The
first is, that neuer any in our
flesh liued spotlesse, and voide
of sinne, but Christ onely.
There is the iustifying Spirite
of Sanctification.
            The second is, that neuer
any of himselfe, but Christ
Iesus loosed the bandes of
death, and arose from the
fetters of the graue. There is
the Iustifying Spirite of power
in the Resurrection; and
euen in this very phrase Athanasins
               
speaketh, to witte,
That Christ was iustified,
               Non humano more sed diuina puritate. 
               not after
the manner of men, but by
diuine puritie,
            
            To this end, that he should
bee honoured and worshipped,
not as a meere man, albeit
hee was truly man, but
as the eternall God in our
flesh. This therefore is the
Catholique Faith which,
whosoeuer doth not beleeue,
cannot bee saued. That Iesus
Christ is knowne by his
power in the spirite, to be the
very son of God against the
Ma
                  •
               cionites, Gods sonne by
nature, not by grace against
the Arrians, that hee was begotten
of the Father against
the Bonosians, & that frō euerlasting,
against the Natiuitarians;
that hee was God of
himselfe, against the Donatists,
and that hee was coequall
with the Father, and consubstantiall
against the Macedoans.
               
This Iustification of the
Sonne of God was declared
in the spirit of power, and in
the spirite of purity, as I haue
sayde out of Saint Paul to the
Romanes.
            In the power of the Spirit
it was declared against al the
powers of darkenesse, which
flesh and bloud could not abandon.
For besides the generall
cessation of Oracles at
his comming, the particular
Idols were euery where defaced
and confounded. Astorah
of the Sydonians, Melchom
of the Ammonites, Chemosh
of the Moabites, Belzebub
of Ekron, Remphan of the Sirians,
Dagon of the Philistines,
Moloch of the Egyptians, and
many others, were in all places
of the world put to vtter
confusion: Because the God
of this world, which is the diuell
was cast out, and the strō
               ger
man surprised the strong

man, dispossessed him, dispoiled
him, and vtterly vanquished
him. Insomuch that the
very diuels cry, Torment vs
not before our time: and aske
leaue to goe euen into sordid
swine. Thus was he iustified
in the power of the Spirite, in

                  •
               anquishing the powers of
darkenes.
            His Iustification was also
declared by the spirit of power
against his enemies, as appeared
by the fower Herods,
As
                     •
                  alonita, Archelaus, Antipas,
and Agrippa, who being Tyrants,
and persecutors of
Christ in his infancy, and of
some of his followers, there
appeared vppon them the
strong hand of God, that
brought them to pittifull and
lamentable confusions. But
most notably and most notoriously
the Iustification of the
same God, Christ Iesus our
Lord in the Spirit of power

appeareth most euidently, euen
at this day to the viewe
of the whole christian world,
in his continued iudgements
vpon the whole nation of the
Iewes, who were subuerted,
and vtterly ouerthrowne by
the Romans, at the very time
of the yeare wherein they
crucified Christ, which was
about Easter: For at that very
time of their great festiuity,
the Roman
                  •
               s came, and
besieged Hierusalem.
            
            And as from Mount Oliuet
they apprehēded Christ;
so from that Mou
                  •
               t was their
City entered, and surprised:
And as they hurried the
Lord Iesus from Pilate to
Herod; so they were hurried
vp and downe during the
siege, from Iohn to Simeon, and
from Simeon to Iohn, two notable
villaines that did mutinize
within the City to their
vnspeakeable torment, vexation,

and vtter subuersion.
And as they whipped the
Lord of Life, and attired him
in despicable maner, in contempt
and scorne; Euen so
they were whipped vp and
downe the holy City in great
villany and reproach by the
Romane souldiers.
            And as the Lord Iesus was
solde for thirty peeces of siluer
by Iudas a Iew; euen so
thirty of the Iewes in the sacking
of the City were solde
for one peece of siluer by the
Souldiers. And euen yet
the hand of Gods power to
iustifie his sonnes innocency,
is not shortned, but stretched
out against them still.
            The holy bloud of Christ
crying against them, and against
their children (as they
themselues desired) for vengeance.
They liuing as a
forlorne and scattered people
vpon the surface of the

earth without Priest or Prophet,
King or Scepter, comfort
or compassion.
            In a word tell me, who
did euer striue against the
Messias and did prosper, or
band himselfe against Christ,
or Christian, and was not
confounded? Christ was also
iustified by the spirit of sanctifying
puritie; beeing pure,
and spotlesse in himselfe, both
in body and soule, for there
was not any guile in him, and
also pure in his redeemed people
effectually. In himselfe
pure, his conception pure by
the holy Ghost, his birth pure
of a Virgin, his life pure, both
in word and deed, in life and
death pure, for hee offended
not, no not so much as in his
tongue, and he is perfect that
so offendeth not.
            In his redeemed people
pure, by the effects of the
same iustifying spirite: For

whereas all the whole world
else is set vpon wickednesse,
hunting eyther with profite,
as with a bloud-hound, or
else beeing befooled or besotted
with pleasures, as theyr
Helena (these two beeing, as
it were, the two Poles wheron
the whole world else is
turned) the spirite of Christ
hath wrought in those that are
his, 
                  •
               uch a measure of sanctification,
that they minde
and breath nothing but Heauen,
and heauenly things. If
it thūder that (say they) is the
voyce of our heauenly Father;
If they cast their eyes
to those visible heauens, there
(say they) is the curtaine, or
base court of our inheritance
among the Sa
                  •
               nts.
            If they heare musicke,
Oh (say they) what harmony
do the Angels make in Heauen?
If they behold the earth
and the glory therof, they say,
            
               If God haue prouided such
a place of pleasure for vs on
earth in this our prison; What
glory is that hee hath layde
vp for vs in heauen.
            In all occurrences of their
life, they sauour nothing but
of God and goodnesse. In a
Word, they liue not, but
Christ liueth in them.
               Gal. 2. 20. For this
is indeed the true beeing of
Christians, wholy to giue ouer
themselues to bee guided
by Gods holy iustifying Spirite.
            Their life is to liue in the
Spirite, their passages are to
walke in the spirite, If they
resolue, their station is in the
spirite. If they bee deuoute,
They pray in the Spirite.
            
            Al their whole seruice of
God,Iohn 6. is to Worship him in spirit
and truth. Otherwise, those
that haue not this spirite, that
is, are not guided thereby, are
none of his:
               Rom. 8. For as in the creation

of the World,Gen. 1. 
               The spirite
of God moued vpon the waters;
So certainely now in the Regeneration,
and new birth of
the Christian World: the Spirite
of God moueth vpon the
affections of our harts, to turn
the riuers in the south, that is,
to turne the streame of our
actions and courses of our life
to the Ocean, the liuing God,
For hee hath made vs for him
selfe, and therefore our hearts
are neuer quiet,Aug. lib. 1. Confess. vntill wee returne
vnto the Lord our God
againe.
            When Christ therefore
speaketh,Application hee speaketh by the
spirit to the Churches for the
Scripture sayth,Apoc. 3 
               Let him that
hath an eare to heare, heare
what the spirite sayth to the
Churches.
            
            The Comforter also of
Gods Church is the spirite,
which is Gods gift vnto his,

and doth Witnesse with the spirite,
               Rom. 8.
               That wee are the sonnnes of
God.
            
            There is the certainty of
the subiect of our Faith, The
spirite doth make intercession for
vs, with sighes vnutterable.
            
            There is the breath of
our prayers, and doth helpe
our infirmities, There is the
stay and pillar of all our happinesse,Cor. 15.
               The first Adam being
a liuing soule, but the second Adam
a quickning spirite: For
they are quickned, in whom
this blessed spirite dwelleth,
both toward God in the spirite
of faith, and holy vnion,
and in the spirite of zeale being
rauished for the hope of
Heauen, as appeared in the
blessed Martyres, and also
quickned towardes others in
the spirite of charity, keeping
the vnity of the spirite in the
bonde of peace, in the spirit of
meekenesse, and placabilitie

being easie to bee entreated
for Christs sake. Quickened
in themselues in the Spirit of
sanctification,1 Ioh. 3. purging themselues
for their assured hope
of Heauen, and in the spirit of
sinceritie,Mich. 6. 
               Doing iustly in all
their actions with all men.
            
            To this purpose, the earnest
of the Spirit is giuen the
Elect, euen in this life, neuer
to be taken away, but to bee
made vp (for that is the 
                  〈◊〉
               
of an earnest) and the
pledge of the spirite, as an hostage
to secure them; the seale
of the promise to sanctifie
them, and the spirit it selfe being
the Doctor of trueth, to
leade them into all truth, that
their sensuall part may bee
guided by right reason, theyr
reason ordered by faith, and
their faith illuminated, sanctified,
and ledde on by the
Spirite of God. Indeede to
them that seeke, not after

God, this directiō of his most
holy spirite is hateful, and the
reason is very plaine. Euen
because this sacred spirite of
the eternall God,Iohn 16, 
               Rebuketh
the world of sinne, of righteousnes
and of iudgement.
            
            It rebuketh the world of
sinne, because the wicked
world beleeueth not, which
is the Sinne of Sinnes, as I may
so say, but is fraught with furious
spirits of blind ignorāce,
and desperatefolly, which
cast thousands into fires, and
waters of misperswasion, and
misbeleefe, and these worldlings
are caught away with
vnpure spirites of sensuall security;
which possesse them
both with dumbnes & deafenesse,
that they can neyther
speake of God, but in their
blasphemous cursinges and
swearings, nor heare of God,
without great wearisomnesse
and discontent,
            
               This sacred spirite also
rebuketh the world of righteousnesse,
because, sayeth
Christ, I goe the right way
vnto the Father; but the world
is ledde by witte worshippes,
will worships, and other such
deuises of singularity & conceited
righteousnesse of mans
many inuentions.
            Some with Anabaptisme,Eccles. 7.
which is the diuell in an Angell
of light, and some with
Iesuitisme, which is a subtil &
slie Antichrist in the Church
And this holy spirit rebuketh
the world of Iudgement, because
the Prince of this world
is iudged already, and the vnbeleeuers
his vassalls, and
slaues, are iudged with him,
and are reserued for the further
iudgement, and vtter
darkenesse of these vnpure
spirites, that are already in
chaines to be brought forth in
the great audite of Christ, and

end of the world. For what
deuoute soule trembleth not?
yea shuddereth not with horror,
to know that Sathan is
the God of this world,2 Cor. 4. 4. and to
conceiue that seuen spirites of
euil, yea Legions of vncleane
spirites. may obsesse, possesse,
and hellifie the soule, and bodie
of one man, or of one woman.
            I wonder that the whole
frame and fabrique of nature,
shaketh and quaketh not to
beare, and heare those hellish
and diuelish miscreants, that
when the seruants of GOD
preach solemnely, soberly, &
seriously, in the power, zeale
and abundance of their spirit,
say to them, as Festus sayd to
Paul, This man is beside himselfe,
much learning makes him
mad; and say to others, as
the Iewes to the Apostles,
when they had receyued the
gift of the holy spirit.
            
               
               These men are drunke with
wine; or else take vpon them
in the diuelish and damnable
pride of their owne hearts, to
direct the whole world, in
the misperswasion of their
own singular and priuate spirite,
not in order to God, as
they pretend, but in confusion
to the diuell, as the ende
shewes.
            So did Iohn of Leidon,
Nipper Doling, Chreiton, and
others of that crew of wretched
miscreants, who at Munster
in their enraged and rebellious
route cryed out (being
led by a cursed spirite of
their owne) nothing but Depose,
kill, murther, meaning
those sober and moderate
Christians, that withstoode
their brainesicke fury, and Anabaptisticall
fanaticall folly,
and in all that outrage pretended
nothing; but that they
were guided thereunto by the

spirite. So doe those that are
engaged into the spirite of
Antichrist, and enraged with
the poysoned cup of the strū
               pet
of Romish Babylon, her spiritual
fornication, who speak,
write, and practise prepensed
wickednesse, as did Cardinal
Como to Parrie the traytor,This Record remaines in the acts of Parrie his arraignmēt.
what time hee intended; nay
receyued their consecrated
host with the saide Cardinall
to kill our late Queene Elizabeth
of pretious memorie,
signifying by letter vnto him,
that the then Pope Gregorie
the thirteenth, as by the
Credentiall note included in
the letter, he might see, doubted
not but that the same spirite,
which moued him to so
good a worke, as to kill the
Queene, would certainely
assist him to the performance
thereof.
            Oh barbarous spirite of
brutish Popery, So do those

that scoffe at the gifts of the
Spirite in their brethren, saying
to those whom they see
reuearing, and yeelding obedience
to the power of
Gods grace, and counselling
others to be guided & gouerned
thereby. Oh Sir, you are
so full of the spirite that it runs
out of your nose. Oh sir, the spirite
moueth you.
            
            This and the like hellish
language, I say, is an amazement
vnto good men, to
thinke there should be any fo
damnably prophane, and so
desperately wicked, especially
among Christians, who
professe in their holy Creede,
to beleeue in the holy spirite,
and acknowledge that in the
power of that spirit, They liue,
moue,
               Act 16. 
               and haue their being, yea
and they feele themselues
oft times quickned from the
dulnesse of sinne by the same
spirit, vnto the motion, and

life of grace,Rom. 2. wherby they are
made vnexcusable.
            And professe further,
that they beleeue that they
shall bee raysed vppe out
of their dust, and from
the bands and fetters of the
graue, by the operation of
this powerfull and blessed
spirite vnto eternall glory, by
that mighty working whereby
it is able to subdue allPhil. 3.
things vnto it selfe.
            This (I say) is a great consternation
and amazement
vnto a Christian heart, and
causeth oft times many good
soules to quake and shudder
to see, and behold such desperate
scornings, and reprochful
contumelies among such, as
professe they beleeue in
God.
            The serious consideration
whereof (I am perswaded)
would eftsoones
trouble the mindes of many

other, with grieuous distractions
and disturbances,
had not the holy booke of
God in two most pregnant
places of the new Testament,
set foorth to the life, both of
the Apostacie of faith, and irregularity
of good manners,
which the spirit of God prophesyeth
should happen in
these last and worst ages of
the world. For Saint Paul
teacheth the Bishoppe of Ephesus,
That the spirite speaketh
euidently,1. Tim. 4. 1. 
               That in the
latter times some shall depart
from the faith, and shall giue
heede to spirites of error, and
doctrines of Diuels.
            
            The spirites of error are
such, in whome there is no
sound trueth of GOD,
but mingled and mangled
with humane traditions,
no conscience of good, but
iustifyings of their owne inuentions.
            
               The doctrines of diuels
are prohibitions of marriage,
and superstitious abstaining
from meates, as the Text speaketh,
And I take those spirits
of errors, and doctrines of diuels,
are no where to be foūd
in the Christian Church
more pregnant, for we must
not looke for them among
Turkes and Pagans, because
this Prophesie reuealeth what
shall happen in the Church,
and amongst professors of
Christ, but in the Papacy only,
which in the later times,
that is, some sixe hundred
yeares agoe, or thereaboutes,
vtterly fell away from the verity
of the faith of Christ, and
gaue heede to the spirites of
errors, & doctrines of diuels,
intending nothing else thereby
but the subuersion of the
Primitiue purity of Religion,
and conuersion of the internall
beauty of the Church of

Christ, into an externall, and
pompous lustre of humane
policie.
            And againe Saint Paul
sheweth by the euidence of
the same spirite,2. Tim. 3. 
               That in the
last dayes, which are these
worst dayes of ours, should
come perillous times, wherein
men should bee louers of themselues,
couetous boasters, proud,
cursed speakers, disobedient to
parents, vnthankefull, vnholy,
without naturall affections, truce
breakers, false accusers, intemperate,
fierce, no louers at all
of them that are good, traytors,
beady, high minded, louers of
pleasure more then of God, hauing
a shew of Godlinesse, but
haue denied the power thereof,
from which Saint Paul counselleth
to turne away.
            
            These (Men and Brethren)
These, I say, are the
faithlesse and fruitlesse spirites
of vanity, the dissolute children

of disobedience, and
cloudes without water, who
despite the spirite of grace,
Quench the light of the Gospell,
               Act. 19.
and know not whether
there bee an holy Ghost or
no.
            But (Men and Brethren)
Hearken, whosoeuer offendeth
of infirmity, offendeth
against God the Father, who
is power and strength, and
whosoeuer offendeth of ignorance,
sinneth against God
the Sonne, who is wisedome,
and these finnes are pardonable,
but who so sinneth against
the Holy Ghost, the
spirite of truth and charity,
his sinnes are irremisible.
            Let him therefore that
hath an eare, heare what the
Spirite sayth vnto the Churches:

well conceyted of themselues.
            
            Christ Iesus who was our
Reconciliation on earth, by
his Incarnation, Life, and
Passion, is now our Aduocation
in heauen, at the right
hand of God the Father, by
his continual Mediation, and
is our dayly Comforter, (as
Saint Bernard speaketh) by
mouing,In occulto, ait Bernard. stirring, and inclining
our harts to beleeue,
and our wils, and consciences
to the obedience of faith,
and to the endeauour, care
and study of all sacred duties.
Are not they then in a
most desperate and wofull estate
and condition, thinke
you, who despise and despite
this Reconciliation, Aduocation,
Mediation, & Consolation
of Gods spirit, who continue
in that sinne, for which
there is neyther sacrifice, no
                  •
               
oblation to bee offered,

that can doe them, or theirs
any good who resist the Spirite
of Christ, albeit it stand
at the dore of their hearts and
consciences, and craue for entrance,
who grieue the spirite
of God by their vile and
beastlie liuing, and quench
out the light thereof by their
ouer-flowings of malitiousnesse,
which otherwise would
shine and glitter, like the sparkles
of a diamond in the middest
of our naughtie Natures;
and in a word, who haue in
them no gifte, grace, condition,
qualitie, sparke or resemblance
of Gods spirite
whatsoeuer they may brag,
and boast thereof, out of their
owne deceiueable seemings,
but only this, that their goodnesse,
so Anabaptistically are
they besotted, cannot be seen
as the holy Ghost is inuisible.
            And no lesse lamentable

are the cauils of those which
obiect, That the Iesuites
(whom wee so vilifie) boast
also that they are led by the
spirite, as if most damnable
heretiques did not make the
same plea; but the practise of
the Nobles of Baroa is a satisfactory
answere for that, and
all other cauils of that frie: for
they searched the Scriptures:Act. 17.
               To see whether or no the thinges
were so that they heard the Apostles
preach; but the spirite of
Iesuitisme dare not abide that
triall, nor any other like spirit
of error.
            Another saith, there bee so
manie that vaunte of the spirit,
that I knowe not which I
should adhere vnto, but Saint
Paul giueth a rule for that.
Neuerthelesse (saith he) wherevnto
wee haue already attained,
Let vs march by the same rule,
               Phil. 3. 16.
               (which is the sacred Scriptures)
that wee may minde the same

thing.
            
            This plainely sheweth vs,
that we must adhere to none,
for our direction to God, but
such as adhere to Gods Oracle,
the Sacred scriptures, and
are guided thereby.
            Yea, but another vrgeth further
(and saith) wee see that
those that professe themselues
to bee guided by the Scriptures,
and by the spirit thereof,
doe differ. What then? All
men haue not Faith, albeit in
number and profession they be of
the Church, (as S. Austine speaketh:)
& hence it is that they
cannot accord: For what
communion hath light with
darknes
                  •
               : or Faith with infidelitie?
Yea, euen amongst
them that haue Faith, some
haue a greater, and some a
lesser portion thereof, according
to their knowledge, by
Gods dispensation: & hence
it is oft times that they cannot

accord in all things, at all
times, for there is a procession
from faith to faith, yet all
may holde the Fundamentall
grounds, and principles, in
blessed diuinitie: albeit they
differ in some particulars, because
some haue already attained
to that measure of grace,
which another
                  •
                may attaine
vnto in some time after.
            This therefore is an infall
                  •
               
               ble
rule of S. Iohn:
               1. Ioh▪ 4. 
               We are of
God, hee that knoweth God, heareth
vs: Hee that is not of God,
heareth not vs: Hereby knowe
we the
                     •
                   spirite of Error, and the
spirite of Truth. That is as S.
Augustine expounds it, If any
man take vppon him to expound
the scriptures,
               A se. albeit it bee euen
by himselfe, with inuocation of
GOD, who assists by his holie
spirite, and the spiritual man discerneth
all things,1. Cor: 2. 
               the internall
vnction, directing him in all
things, and leading him into all

truth: To this man wee are
bound to hearken, and his
doctrine to embrace, albeit
thousands gaine say it, as the
Councell of Nice hearkened
to Paphnutius being but one
man against the whole route,
and rabble of Pseudo Catholiques.
            
            But if any man vndertake
to doe it of himselfe, of his
owne priuate, and singular
spirite without warrant, and
directiō of Gods spirit which
counselleth and guideth by
the word onely: It is the
Spiders webbe, the Cockatrice
egge, the fome of the sea, the
fume of the bottomlesse pitte, &
wee may vndoubtedly disauow
it, and defie it.
            I conclude then, that this
foundation standeth firme &
sound, and may satisfie the
soule of any beleeuer, to wit,
that God is manifested in the
flesh, by beeing baptized as

man: Iustified in the Spirite,
by forgiuing sinnes as God:
Manifested in the flesh, by
being tempted as man, Iustified
in the spirite, as God by
ouercomming for vs the

vnto the waters of Life,
that they might neuer thirst

            Come Lord Iesus, Come quickly.
O holy spirit of purity and
power, assist my weake and feeble
spirit, to bee lift vp vnto thee
in prayer.
            
               Oh righteous God,Inuocation. and most
merciful Father in Iesus Christ,
to whome the spirites of the iust
are always, and euery where lift
vp, remember mee in thy great
goodnes. For I acknowledge and
confesse vnto thee my many and
manifolde infirmities, wretchednesses,
and wickednesses, both in
the sinnes of my body, and also in
the sinnes of my soule.
            Now a long time O Lord I haue
bin grieuously tēptead with the spirits,
not of infirmitie only which
dwell in my flesh, but with foule
& filthy spirits, of pride, ambition,
enuie, worldly pollicie, & other
vile & vaine deceitfulnes
of mine own heart, and oft times
with lothsom and vgly spirits of
lust, adultry, gluttony, drūkenes,
wantonesse, & many other such
like euills, which haunt me daily

and seeke to har

               our, in my polluted
flesh, giuing me no rest, nor

respite, but are still seeking, and
daily assayling to ruinate and run
ouer me: and are dayly fighting
and troubling me. I haue sinned
O Lord, I haue sinned, I haue
done euil in thy fight, and these
euills are punishments vnto mee
for the same.
            It is I Oh Lord, it is I, and it
seemeth to me that it is none but
I that euer sinned so hainously against
thee, I seeme to my selfe of
all others to be the most miserable,
most distressed, and most
wretched creature on the earth.
            What shall I doe, O Creator of
heauen and of earth? Thou preseruer
of mankinde, whether shal
I flye from these vgly Monsters,
that thus pursue my soule, and
daylie seeke to preuaile against
me? I know not where to be safe
from them, but onely to flye vnto
thee, Oh Lord, who onely canst
still the raging and the roaring
of the great waters when they arise
and swell: who onely canst

chaine the Diuell when hee is

                  •
               rampant, and ready to deuoure;
and who onely canst cast out the
vncleane spirite with a worde,
that they neuer enter any
more.
            Now therefore come I to
thee, O King of Saints, shewing
to thee my malady, my misery,
my mo
                  •
               rning, how I lye here among
the graues of the deade,
and torment my selfe, being possessed
with the rage, and hell of
my misdeedes, and crie after
thee, O sonne of Dauid, haue
mercy vpon mee, and deliuer
mee by the power of thy
might, by thy stretched out
arme, and by one touch of
thy sacred goodnesse, that it
may dispossesse Sathan, the
strong man of his hold, that it
may heale me, and cast out the
vncleane spirites, and may vtterly
abandon sinne, shame and
Sathan farre from me, and from
my dwellings.
            
               Take from mee for Christ his
sake mine owne wretched spirit
of infidelitie, pride, mallice, and
vnconstancie, and grant vnto me
O Lord, in steed thereof thy blessed
spirit of truth, humilitie, charitie,
and perseuering constancy.
Oh take from me, O Lord, mine
owne spirit of vncleanenesse, couetousnesse,
flouthfulnesse, and
bestow vpon me in steed thereof,
thine holy spirit of purenesse, liberalitie,
and of all carefull, and
Christian circumspection.
            Take from me, deare Father,
mine owne spirit of crookednesse
wherwith I haue beene vexed,
and bowed together for many
yeares, and grant mee thy Spirit
of power to raise me vp, and thy
strength that I may resist sinne
in these dayes of my combating,
that I may so resolutely deuoute
my selfe to the
                  •
               , and to thy sacred
seruice, that I may neuer more
hearken to subtill and enticing
spirits of pleasure, of errors, of

impietie. O sacred spirit that
didst moue vpon the waters in
the creation of the world, now
moue the streames and fountains
of my life, in my regeneration, and
new birth.
            Shake the very foundations
of my soule, that the image of
Christ Iesus may bee repayred in
me, which I vile wretch by my
sinnes haue miserably deformed
and defaced O blessed spirit help
mine infirmities, heale my imperfections,
compassionate my
miseries, and make intercession
for me, with sighes vnutterable,
which will haue no nay. That I
may feele my selfe comforted by
thee, the spirit of consolation in
all the wayes of godlinesse, that
I may perceiue my selfe to bee
led on into all truth and veritie
and may at the last assure mine
owne spirit by thy blessed testimony,
that I am a child of thy
gratious adoption.
            O blessed Iesus that wast declared

mightely to be the son of
God, by the powerfull spirit of
sanctification, and by rising from
the dead, that didst vanquish &
vtterly abandon all the powers,
all the houres of darkenesse, and
spirits of error and misbeleefe,
remoue farre from mee all heathenish,
Pagan, and Popish idolatrie,
all confidence in any creature,
all flattering of mine ownselfe,
that the pure light of thy reuealed
truth may shine into my
heart, that I may euer worship
thee in spirit and truth, as thou
hast commanded. And, O God,
make my life holy, innocent, modest,
and honest in thy sight, that
I may see my heart repayred, and
renued by thy spirit of grace, to
walke before thee in godly and
sincere integritie of conuersation,
all the remainder of my wretched
dayes. So am I assured Sathan
shall neuer circumuent me, nor
the world deceiue me, or mine
owne flesh intice mee, or enforce

me from thy holy and sacred directions,
but if I fall, I shall rise
againe, if I turne away at any
time, I shall returne againe. So
shall I euer magnifie thy name,
and multiplie prayses vnto thy
maiestie, and ascribe vnto thee
honor, and praise all my life long.
            Grant these mercies vnto me
O father of comfort, and power,

apparant, and the glory thereof
so great that it filled heauen

hath these fowre, Raphael,
which is power of healing,
Vriel named so of the light,
Ieremiel called so of the mercie
of God, and Shealtiel designing
the prayse of God.
            The Canonicall Epistles
of Saint Paul to the Churches
of Ephesus,
               Eph. 3. 10. and Colossi,
               Col. 1. 16.
declare their nature by fiue
tearmes of puissance, calling
them Thrones, as attendants
on Gods tribunall to doe, and
execute his decrees, dominations,
as being authenticall, &
hauing powerfull warrant for
what they do, principalities, as
guiding & guarding their seueral
limited, & especially appointed
princedoms, powers,
as hauing effectuall working
ouer inferiors, Mights as
being Gods great guard, who
is the Lord of hosts, & angels

generally in the whole body
of the Scripture, which noteth
their generall imployment,
being Gods nuntioes, emissaries,
& messengers,Dan. 7. 10. 
               A thousand
thousand of which stand before
him, & 10000. minister vnto
him. Such are their names,
such are their natures, & such
are their general imploymēts.
            And as for their conceited
hierarchies of angels, assisting
Seraphins, Cherubins, & thrones
Angels cōmanding dominations,
principalities, powers, angels
executing, Michael, Gabriel,
Raphael, are rather fancies thē
verities, rather imaginations
then conclusions of diuinity.
            As for their number, wee
are sure it is numberlesse. For
Daniel saith,Iunius in Iocum. Dan▪ 7. 
               A thousand thousand
stand before him, and ten
thousand minister vnto him:
where a difinite number is
put for an indefinite. Christ
himself also testifies it saying.
            
               
               I can euen now pray vnto my
Father, and he will giue me more
then twelue legions of Angels;

and the spirt of God witnesseth,
That wee are come to innumerable

this is a singular comfort vnto
vs, for hence we know that
more are with vs, then against

            This Misterie of Godlinesse,
is sayde here to bee seene of
these glorious spirits the Angels,
so that wee see Godlines
is Angelicall.
            Seene, that is, perfectly
knowne, for what we see we
auerre confidently against all
gainesayers to be true, for we
auouch with asseueration,Vident animo eloquere (mi fili) vt te videam Senec. that
we saw it with our eyes.
            Seene intellectually, as the
Lattins speake, they see in
their mindes: Speake on my son
that I may see thee.
            
            In which sence also the
Angels who are childrens

Gardians, are fayde alwayes
to behold the face of their Father
in heauen.
               Mat. 18.
            
            Vnto naturall sight three
things are required. First the
power of seeing, then the
light, as the meanes of seeing,
and a visible forme for the
obiect.
            To this intellectual, Angelicall
knowledge or fight are
three things also requisite.
            First, their intellectuall power
of knowledge giuen thē
by their Creator in their creation;
then the reflection of
Gods light, as the meanes of
their knowledge, and the sacred
body of Christ Iesus as
the visible obiect to delight
them.
            The knowledge then
of Angells is twofold, the
one naturall whereby they
see, and know God in the
vndeuided Trinitie (to wit)
the Father, Sonne, and holy

Ghost) one in essence, and
three in existence, and all
the creatures of God in this
blessed vision.
            The other knowledge of
things is two fold: First, by
a matutine knowledge, as
Saint Angustiue calleth it,
knowing, and seeing all
things in the Word, by whom
all things were made, and
afterwards by a view of the
creatures in themselues. For
the Angells see the creatures
in God, and men see God in
the creatures.
            Playnely thus, Euclides,
Archimides, or some such like
skilfull Mathematitian, first
seeth, and knoweth the
length, and breadth, and
all the demensions of the
lines, and euery turning,
tryangle, and particular
parcell of his draught and
circle in his minde and

cogitation, and afterwardes
seeth and knoweth the same
lines, angles, and Circles,
in the table, dust or earth,
wherein hee draweth those
proportions; semblably the
Angels see, and know all
things reuealed vnto them:
First in God, and then in the
Creatures; in God, as in their
mindes, in the Creatures, as in
the reuealed obiects, For
Angels haue a naturall knowledge,
wherein they were
created, euen as many as
continued their stations in
the truth and seruice of their
Creator, and they haue also
reuealed knowledge from
God in seuerall particulars, as
to the Angell Gabriel was
made knowne in particular
the Incarnation of the Messia
                     •
                  .
And they haue also an
experimentall knowledge of
Gods wisdome in the mysterie
of his sonnes Inca

Paul witnesseth, Vnto mee
(sayth he) who am lesse, then
the least of al Saints,
               Eph. 3. 10. 
               is this grace
giuen, that I should preach among
the Gentiles the vnsearchable
riches of Christ, and to
make all men see what is the
fellowship of the mysterie which
from the beginning of the world
hath beene hid in God, who created
all things by Iesus Christ, to

Church) the manifolde wisdome
of God.
            
            And this is most apparant
in the sight, and certaine
knowledge, that the Angels
of Heauen had of the particulars
touching this blessed mysterie;
for before Christs incarnation,
the time of the
sixtie two weekes, which was
the time, from that prophesie

to his passion was seene▪
and known to an Angel,Dan. 9. 24. that
reuealed it by Gods appointment
to Daniel.
            
            Christs name was foretolde
by an Angell before hee
was conceiued in the womb;Mat. 1.
his conception reuealed by
an Angell,Luk. 1. and both to the
blessed Virgin;Luk. 2. his birth was
proclamed to the shepheards
by a troupe of Angels;Mat. 2. his
flight into Egypt from Herods
butcherie; his returning
out of Egygt, and turning aside
into the confines of Galilee,
all directed and ordered
by an Angell, that God especially
imployed in that message.
            In his temptation in the
wildernesse,Mat. 4. Angelles minister
vnto him,Luk. 22. in his agonie,
an Angell from heauen comforteth
him,Mat. 26▪
                in his apprehension
hee testifieth to his enemies
teeth, that hee could

haue a guarde of more then
twelue Legions of Angels, if
he should desire them of his
heauenly Father.
            While he was in the graue
an Angell descendeth,Mat. 28. and
rouled away the stone from
the dore of the monument.
            After his Resurrection,
two Angels sate one at the
head, and the other at the
feet,Ioh. 20. 20. where Iesus body had
layne, and declared that hee
was rise
                  •
                from the dead, they
beeing imployed by God to
bring that message to the
then mournfull and sorrowfull
Disciples, for the late
death of their heauenly master.
            In his Ascension two Angels
spake vnto the people,
that gazed vp into Heauen,Act, 1. 11
after him, and certified them
of his comming againe to
iudgement in the end of the
world.
            
               Yea the very euill Angels
saw and knew the power
of the sonne of God in this
manifestation to their great
terror and torment.
            Insomuch that they crie
in the possessed;Mat. 8. 
               Oh Iesu, what
haue wee to doe with thee? Art
thou come to torment vs before
our time? And when they
were forced to depart out of
the possessed, they roare and
yell, yea they fell downe, and
confesse saying,Luke 8. 
               Thou art the
Sonne of God: and at the last
being driuen by extremit
                  •
               es,
they desperately attempt to
coniure Iesus Christ by God
himselfe, not to torment
them.
            Moreouer, after Christ
departure into Heauen,Mar. 5. his
very Name was, and yet is
most dreadfull vnto them,
and most powerfull against
them: For S. Paul by the
power of Christs name cast

out an euill Angell out of a
Damsell that had a spirite of
diuination.Act. 16.
            
            And the Disciples of
Christ came vnto him reioising,
that euill Angels were
madeLuk. 10. 17. subiect vnto them
through his Name.
            Whereby it appeareth
to our vnspeakeable comfort
that the God whom we
serue, was knowne and acknowledged
of the blessed
Angels, yea, and that euill
Angels also felt his power,
and know him to their faster
and deeper despayre, and
are now, and alwayes made
subiect to Gods elect.
            
               What vnspeakeable comfort
is the knowledge of this
vnto vs?Applicatiō. What excellent direction
doth this Angelicall
knowledge affoord vs in our
Euangelical seruice, and what
diuine incitement is this to
stir vp in vs Angelical zeale?
Comfort it is vnspeakable.
            For all these blessed Spirites
are the attendants of our
Lord Christ, and are his Emissaries
and Nuntioes, sent
out by him for the good of
them that shall be saued.Heb. 1.
            
            Not that euery particular
person hath a peculiar Angell
designed vnto him to bee his
Guardian (as the Popelings
would haue it) but
hence wee know,Psal. 91. that not
one Angell, but many are
ordayned by God to succour
and safeguard vs in all
necessities and distresses what
soeuer.
            
               And without controuersie,
this is more comfort a
thousand times, then to know
that one Angell onely is appointed
to bee our assistant,
In our life, in our death, and
in the day of iudgement, they
are appointed of God to bee
our assistants. In our life,
yea in all our life: In childehoode,
Christ sayth,Mat. 18. 
               Take heed
yee despise not one of these little
ones, for I say vnto you, that
in Heauen their Angels doe
alwaies behold the face of my
Father which is in heauen.
            
            In affliction Hagar is
comforted by an Angell.Gen. 16. In
the warres Angels fight for
Israel against the Assirians.Es. 38.
            
            In prison Peter is loosed
out of prison,Act. 12. and out of the
fetters by an Angell, albeit
hee slept betweene two souldiers
that tooke vpon them
to be his keepers.
            
               In all our waies the Angels
haue charge to bee our
Conuoy towardes Heauen.Mat. 4.
               Psal. 91.
            
            At sea in shipwracke, an
Angell comforteth Paul,
               Act. 27. and
sheweth vnto him what wold
be the issue of that voyage.
            On land, Iacob in his
iourney to Mesopotamia,
               Gen. 28. is
guided by an Angell.
            In death they transport vs
into Abrahams bosome,Luc. 16. and
keep watch ouer our interred
bodies vntill the Resurrection.
And in that great haruest
at the end of the world, they
are the Reapers in that great
solemnity, and exceeding
Maiesty, They are the Harbengers,
Heraldes and Trumpeters,1 Cor. 15.
and in the sentence of
that iudgement they shall bee
the deuiders that shall separate
the good from the bad.Mat. 1 3
            
            Oh that our seruice of
God then were practised byMat. 25.
               
vs according to our prayers:
For wee pray, Thy will be done
O Lord, euen on earth, as it is
in Heauen, that is by vs Christians
on earth, as by holy angels
in heauen. The Angels
seeing and beholding this
great and wonderfull sacred
mystery, Prayse God continually,
crying Holy,
               Es. 6▪
                
               Holy, Holy
Lord God of Saboth; should
not wee also both by prayers
and praises magnifie our God
vncessantly.
            The Angels most readily
exceute Gods will, should
not we with King Dauid say,
Our hearts are prepared, we are
ready to doe thy wil, O Lord.
            
            The Angels loue God aboue
all things: why do we
esteeme any thing in the
World but for him, and for
his sake, as helpers to leade
vs towards him.
            The Angels long after
our saluation, and much

ioy therein: Why doe wee
thrust one another into Hell;
and heauinesse by our lewdnesse,
misperswasion, and euill
example?
            The Angels desire yet
further to see the perfection,
and finall consummation of
this glorious mystery of
Christs Kingdome, why do
wee wretches neglect the
blessed meanes thereof,
which are offered vnto vs euery
day?
            Thus the blessed Angells
doe, because they are
a part of the Ch
                  •
               rch vniuersally
considered, whereof
our Lord Christ is the head,
and they much ioy for our
association with them,
whereby the ruine of those
Angells that fell, is repayred,
and for the Incarnation
of the Son of God, wherby
they are in grace most

assuredly confirmed for euermore.
            Why should not wee,
hauing so cleare a reuclation
and so displayed a sight, both'
in Gods workes, in Gods
word, and in the face of Iesus
Christ; Why should not
wee, (I say Men and Brethren)
endeauour that we may
doe Gods will, in some measure
on earth, as the blessed
Angels do in Heauen, seeing
God hath placed vs in the
middest, creating vs neyther
Angels nor beasts, but affording
vs the meanes by the
preaching of the Gospell, that
by Regeneration: wee might
become as glorious as the angels
of Heauen, and not by
degeneration become worse
then brute beasts: For God
hath giuen vs the sparkes of
right reason to surpassebeasts,
and holy grace to surpasse our
selues.
            
               Is it not then a thousand
sorrows to euery good beleeuing
heart to conceyue, that
albeit God in his aboundant
mercies hath thus reuealed
himselfe vnto vs in the manifestation
of our flesh, among
vs by the power of this Almighty
spirite aboue vs, and
by the testimony of Angels
about vs, yet there should
bee of them that professe
Christianity, such as are
worse then the Sect of the
Saduces, for the Sadduces
yet acknowledge that Angels
were the good motions
stirred vp in vs, but these neither
acknowledge God, good
motions, nor diuels, but are
copartners with the Diuell against
Michael, and his Angels,
and are become CombatantsApoc. 12
against Christ, and his
Christians.
            Hath not Sathan (thinke
you) sifted such to the bran,

and winnowed such to the
chaffe by his damned motions,
that he hath made them
good for nothing, and left in
them nothing but the dregs,
and remnants of himselfe, as
namely, the eagernesse, and
greedy desire of hauing, and
the cursed sins of despite and
malice: for they haue taken
the Diuell at his word, when
he shewed them the Worlde,
and the glory therof, and said
vnto them.Mat. 4. 
               All this will I giue
you, they immediately fall
downe and worship him. Or
else shew themselues to be of
the diuels pedegree by the
grosnes of lying,Iohn 4. by the fulnes
of impurity, by the subtilty
of sorcery, or as was sayde
by the mischiefe of helsish
malice.
            All which dregs of the diuel.
hide the sonne of God
from those children of disobedience,
and nothing remaineth

for thē (except they
repent) but the fearefull sentence
of Depart from mee yee
               Mat. 25
               cursed into hell fire, prepared for
the Diuel and his Angels.
            
            Whereas if the sonnes of
mē would consider but what
losses they sustaine hereby, me
thinkes it should recall euery
good mind, but of an ordinary
vnderstanding to a far better
dispositiō: For we Christians
lose by such wickednesse
the honour of beeing such euill
Angels Iudges;1 Cor. 6. 
               Why doe
not yee know that we shall iudge
the Angels? that is, doe ye not
know that we shall be assessors
with Christ in the day of iudgment,
and condemne the diuell
and his angels?
            We lose the sight of Christs
mysticall body in the glory of
his Saints,2. Pet. 1. 
               Which the Angels of
heauen desired to behold.
            
            We loose the victorious
triumph of Gods Saints, for

shortly Sathan shall bee beate
               1. Thess 4.
               downe vnder our feet.
            
            Let vs then rayse vppe
our selues to his glorious assotiation
of the Angels, in our
seruice of God, knowing, that
there are more with vs,
then against vs, and
that our Lord (Christ Iesus
shal appeare in the end of the
world with this holy Angels
in Maiesty,Mat. 25. and great glory to
iudge all mankind.
            
               And I adiure you before
Iesus Christ, and his Elect
Angels,
               Tim. 21. 
               that yee diligently
and duely consider these
things,

            GOD PREACHED
vnto the Gentiles.
            Explication.
            THis Mystery of Godlines,
you see, hath been Manifestedin
the flesh,
               The fourth day of the weeke. 
               Iustified
in the Spirit, Seene of Angels,
that is, It hath bin manifested
vnto vs in the persō of Christ
in the power of Christ, and in
the knowledge seruice, and
ministration of the blessed
Angels of Christ. What can
we then say for our selues?
Haue not wee heard of this
great mystery of godlines?
Hath it bin hidde in a corner
from vs? or whispered in the
eare, or beene knowne to a
few, or published to a handful
of people in some angle or
corner of the world.
            
               Haue the Iewes onely had
this made knowne vnto thē?
Assuredly God hath beene
Preached. There is the promulgation
or proclamation
of this mysterie. God hath
beene Preached to the Gentiles.
There is the large extent of
this promulgation God preached
vnto the Gentils.
               1. Cor. 1. 
               For it hath
pleased God by that which the
world calleth the foolishnesse of
Preaching to make knowne vnto
the world his vnsearchable wisdome,
and the riches of his glorious
grace in Christ.
            
            
               Preaching being the gift of
the holy Ghost, the spirit of
prophesie, the glad tydings of
peace, of good things, and of
saluation, caused Esayas an E
               
                  •
               angelicall
Prophet of the
Lord, to say, That the very feet
of them that brought this newes
vnto the world were beautifull.
            
            
               Preaching being the embassage
of our reconciliationwith

God in Christ, the holy
ordinance of God,2. Cor. 5. for the ordinary
meanes of our sanctificatiō
by grace in this world,
and the cleeare publication
of our assured glorification in
the other world, caused Paul
to say, Woe is me if I preach
not the Gospell: so necessary it
was for him and all beleeuers.
            
               Preaching to youth is,Ezec. 16. as Ezechiel
his cleane water to asswage
the heate of their concupiscence,
and to purge the
old leauen of malitiousnesse.
            It is as Solomon his wine to
strengthen and glad the hartsCant: 1.
of the ancient.
            It is as Saint Peter his milke
for children, to nourish and
feede them vp to godlinesse.
            It is as a soueraigne bath to

            Moreouer, this Mysterie
of Godlinesse (God preached
               
vnto the Gentiles) Saint Peter
had shewed vnto him in
his practise of preaching. For
it is sayd, While Peter yet preached
these words,
               Act. 10. 
               the holy Ghost
fell on all them that hard the
Word. Obserue this saying:
            The gift of the holy Ghost fell
on the auditors, as Peter was a
preaching.
            Out of doubt preaching
is the heauenly talent left
vnto the ministers of the
Gospell by their Maister
Christ,Mat. 26. where withall they
must negotiate, and wherein
they must imploy themselues
vntill hee come againe vnto
his great audite in the end of
the world. And the preaching
of this mysterie is the
power of our God, the glory
of our Preachers, to the saluation
both of Preachers and
people. Preaching hath the
power of edification through
God in Christ, and worketh,

Christ our Lord.
            Preaching is the voyce of
God, whereby hee preacheth,
and publisheth his holy will,
and last testament by men, vnthe
sonnes of men.
            In a word, Preaching is the
Manna from heauen to feede
our soules, the dewe of Hermon
to water our barrennesse,
the lampe and light
of God in the darkenesse
of this world for our

direction, the sword of truth
to cut asunder the Gordian
knots of heresie, schisme, and
controuersie for our satisfaction,
the wall of fire by Gods
promise to encompas vs from
enraged beasts, for our protectiō,
the reuelatiō of the rock

            The Iewes were Gods peculiar
to whom he cōmitted
his sacred oracles of trust,Rom. 2. they
were Israelites as preuayling
with God more then any other
nation. To whom onely
were granted the priuiledges

of Priesthood, and the arke of
the couenant. Of whom came
the Patriarkes, the Prophets,
and Iesus Christ our Lord according
to the flesh.Rom. 9.
            
            Concerning the priuiledges
of those people, Moses
challengeth the whole earth
besides, and saith, What nation
is so great? who hath the Lord
so nigh vnto them, as the Lord
our God is in all things that wee
call vpon him for?
            
            And Dauid concludeth it
saying: God sheweth his word
vnto Iacob, and his iudgements
vnto Israel. Hee hath not dealt
so with any nation, neither hath
the heathen, that is the Gentiles,

Christ there is plenteous redemption.

vnto them, he performes
it. He prophesieth it long before
by Esayas his Euangelicall
Prophet:Es. 2. 2. 
               But in the last
dayes, it shall come to passe, that
the mountaine of the house of the
Lord shall bee established in the
top of the mountaines, and it shal
be exalted aboue the hils, and
the people shall stowe vnto it, and
many nations shall come and say.
Come let vs goe vp vnto the
mountaine of the Lord, and to
the house of the God of Iacob, and
he will teach vs of his wayes, and
we will walke in his pathes. For
the Law of God shall goe foorth
of Sion, and the word of the Lord
from Ierusalem.
            
            And againe, I am sought of
them that asked not for me,
               Es, 5. 5. 
               and
I am sound of them that sought

me not. I sayde, Beholde mee,
               Esa. 65.
               Behold mee vnto a nation that
was not called by name.
            
            And yet againe, God
sayth vnto his Son, Aske of me
and I will giue thee the 
                     •
                  eathen
for thine inheritance,
               Psal. 2. 
               and
the vtmost parts of the earth
for thy possessiō. Did God promise
this, and did hee not
performe? Performed this
was in Melchisedecke king of
Salem; in Abimilech, in Ruth
the Moabitish, in Rhahab the
Cananite, in the Queene of
Sheba, in Hiram King of
Tyre, in Naaman the Assirian,
in Iob the Easterling,
and in the King of Niniute
the Sprians chiefe Cittie, as
in the first fruites of the Messias
purchased by his bloud
vnto God the Father.
            This redemption of the
Gentiles was also Prophesied
in the New Testament,
to wit,
            
               That they should come from
the East and West, and sit downe
with Abraham, Isaack, and Iacob
in the kingdome of heauen,
and that the Gospel should bee
preached to all the world.
            This was performed,Mat 2: as in
the first fruits thereof in the
wise men that came to adore;Mat. 9.
in the Centurion, in the designement
of Saint Paule toAct. 9.
be the minister, and doctor of
the Gentiles; and in Peters vision
wherein hee was taughtAct. 10.
to call nothing common, or
vncleane that God had cleansed,
at what time hee was sent
to preach this mysterie vnto
Cornelius, and to his friendes
being Gentiles.
            
               Yet men and brethren behold
& see with amazement,Application
how vile Preaching & Preachers
are esteemed with many
miscreants.
            For to a Iewish spirit preaching
is a scandall, to a Greek
Phylosopher it is folly, to an
Atheist babling, to a Papist
praching, to an Infidell intol

               erable
tediousnesse, to the desperately
damned a scarre-Crow,
and to the worldling,
and hypocrite a cloake of dishonestie.
            And as the Preaching of
the Gospell is thus vilified, so
Preachers also are contemned.
            But vouchsafe (Blessed in
the Lord) to cast downe your
eyes vpon the Preachers, and
consider well, that albeit their
high Commission is from
the Lord, yet obserue their
contemptible, despicable, and

meane condition among the
sonnes of men.
            By office, Preachers are
the Angels of God, and the
Angels of the Church appoyntedMal. 2.
interpreters of God
to his people,Apoc. 2. & of the people
to God.
            Of God to the people in
the explication, and application
of his reuealed will,
wherein the Preacher is the
mouth of God vnto the
people. He is also the peoples
remembrancer to their God,
when he confesseth for them,
and when hee prayeth for
them, and herein hee is the
mouth of the people to their
God.
            The end of his Ambassage
is to deliuer himselfe,
and his hearers from hell.
            God indeede hath sayde,
to the Artizan, Build man an
house: To the Phisition, heale
this man: To the Souldiour,

            Surely to none but to the
Preacher, and that this is the
Preachers high Commission

                  •
               t playnly appeareth.
            For Iob sayth,Iob. 33. 
               If there bee
a messenger with him, an inpreter
one among thousands to
shew vnto man his vprightnesse,
then hee is gratious vnto him,
and sayth, Deliuer him from
going downe to the pit, I haue
receiued a ransome.
            
            And Saint Paule sheweth,
that to Preachers God
hath delegated the Mysterie,2. Cor. 5.
& Ministerie of our reconciliation,
with God in
Christ, and committed vnto
them the word of attonement,
to be as his Ambassadors

to pray, and beseech men in
Christ steede, that they would
be reconciled to God, whereby
they might be saued.
            
            Well for all this, let their
Commission be what it will,
their Ambassage neuer so diuine,
neuer so Euangelicall,
neuer so Angelicall; I am sure
their condition of all other
mens is oft times most miserable,
most lamentable. Pitifull
experience sheweth it to
view of the whole Christian
world, that none interessed in
that businesse bee qualified
how they will, can please.
            For Esay is too long, Obediah
is too short, Daniel too
hard, Amos too playne, Micheah
too milde, Hoshea too
sharpe, and Ieremie too querulous.
This was the condition
of the Prophets.
            
               Peter is reputed a drunkard,
Paule a Sectary and a
mad man, all the residue of

the Apostles esteemed the riffe
raffe of the world, and the ofscowring
of all things vnto
this day.
            This was the condition of
the Apostles.
            Hence the holy ones of
God became complaynants.
Ieremie sayth, The word
of the Lord was made a reproach
and derision vnto him
dayly, and therefore through the
anguish of his soule, though vnaduisedly,
he cursed the day of
his birth,
               Ier. 20. 
               and the partie that
brought his father the tydings
where he was borne, and bewayleth,
that his mother bare him a
man of strife, and contention to
the whole world. For hauing
neither lent nor borrowed vppon
vsury: yet euery one did curse
him.
            
            Paule also laments the case,
that God had set foorth the Apostles
last, as it were appointed
to death: For we are made, saith

he, a spectacle to the world, and
to Angels, and to men. Wee are
fooles for Christs sake; but yee
are wise: we are weake, but yee
are strong, ye are honourable but
we are despised, being reuiled,
we blesse,1, Cor. 4. being persecuted, wee
suffer it, being defamed, wee entreate,
wee are made as the filth
of the world, and are the off cowring
of all things vnto this day.
            In all this thinke not much
of it (blessed Brethren) for it
is the verie case and condition
of them that now
liue, who are the sincere preachers
of the Gospell of Iesus
Christ, and liue conformable
to the Church wherein they
were bred.
            For what betweene the
common aduersary the Papist,
the diuels mouth the Atheist,
and the intestine firebrand
the Separist, the poore
Conformitant doth ofttimes
more suffer then euer did any

fugitiue Seminarie in Wisbich
Castle.
            But Christ was crucified betweene
malefactors, and orthodoxe
Christians haue euer
beene tortured betweene the
spirits of extremes.
            The Iewes obtruded to
the Lord of life, (when they
had nothing else to say) his
meane parentage. Is not this the
carpenters son? Are not such and
such his sisters?
            
            The obiecting then either
of basenesse of birth, or pouertie
of estate vnto the preachers
of the Gospell, is the
spirit of Iudaisme, and let
men be ware in this case, lest
the Iewish plagues befall
them.
            And the challenging of
singularitie, is the spirite of
Iesuitisme, and let men take
heed of the spirites of errors
and darknes of diuels, for the
diuel can transport himselfe

into an Angell of light, and
such men might proue light
Angels.
            But the sonnes of true wisdome
know, that the most
abiect, and meanest things of
the world, if God take them
into his handes may worke
rare and wonderfull effects.
            Salt beeing taken into the
hand of God maketh the bitter
waters of Iericho to become
sweete. In humane reason
the salt should make the
waters more brackish, but
behold,2. Reg. 2. comming through
Gods hand, as being Gods ordinance,
it causeth sweetenesse.
            The washing in the ordinary
riuer of Iordan at Gods
command cureth the Syrian
Captaine of Leprosie, which
the famoused waters of Abanah
and Pharphar would not
doe.
            What is more vaine then

a dreame? yet Pharoah, Nebuchadnezar,
and Gideon, had
great strength, and potent
directions by dreames presented
vnto them by God?
What is more meane, and
and more vnlikely then clay?
especially to cleere ones eyes,Ioh. 9.
yet this being taken into the
hand of Christ maketh blinde
eyes see playnly?
            What more vnlikely to heale
then touching? yet the beleeuing
woman touched but
the hemme of Christs garment,
and was cured?
            What more vnlikely to
worke miracles then a voyce?
yet the vncleane spirits were
cast out by the voice of Christ
and his Apostles, yea with a
voyce the very dead wereIoh. 11.
raised to life.
            What more vanishing
then a shadow? yet the shadow
of Peter had effectuall
power of doing wonders.Act. 5.
            
            
               Let Preachers then bee
but Salt, yet they are the
Salt of the earth, but ordinarie
water, yet as Apostles they
may water your drye hearts,Mat. 10.
and make them fruitfull to
God, but a Dreame, yet
they may awake you from
the slumber of sinne, and
present vnto you truth,
and puri
                  •
               ie, but dust, and
clay, to bee trodde vnder
your feete, so that they
make you see they care
not, but a voyce in the
wildernesse of this world,
yet they are the forerunners
of the great iudgement,
but shadowes, yet will
they haunt your ghosts vntill
they haue preuayled
with you, if you belong vnto
God.
            And this is not of their
owne worth, & strength, but
(as I said) because God vouchsafeth

to take them into his
hands, whereby hee worketh
out this great worke of
our saluation, as appeareth in
the vision to Saint Iohn, where
it is sayd,Apoc. 1, 
               That God held seuen
stars in his right hand; and in
the last verse of that Chapter
these seuen stars are expounded
to be seuen Ministers of
the Churches of Asia. Therefore
Preachers God holdeth
in his hand, and so their labours
become powerfull.
            But cursed Cauillers, like
Iannes and Iambres, who
withstood Moses, stand vp,
and obiect.
            Wee confesse (say they)
this is most true, if God take
this businesse into his hand:
But alas, we see this practise
of preaching is in the hand, &
handling of many a sinnefull
man, such as are oft times
more enormious, and exorbitant
in their conuersations,

then those that are no Preachers.
            Well, what then? The
word preached eyther by a
good or bad man remayneth
the Word of God still. For
if the wordes of the scripture
reade, or Preached bee but a
meere and deade letter, why
is it called the Spirite of
God?
            And when wee preach, if
it bee but the sound of a
mans voyce onely, why doth
God vpbraid the world That
               Prou. 6.
               hee hath called (when men
haue but preached) and yet ye
haue refused, and why doe the
Prophets when they preached, in
                  
                     •
                  ulcate
so often in all their writings.
Thus sayeth the Lord
of Hosts, when notwithstanding
the Prophets onely in
the voyces of men, spake, and
preached vnto the people.
            Yea, but sayth a second:
If it were Gods worke, it

would not bee fruitlesse, and
vneffectuall in the issue therof.
As if that were not as good
seed which fel among thorns
as that which fell on good
ground? and as if Paul did
not testifie, That to some Preaching
is the oder of Life, vnto
life, and vnto some the sauour of
death vnto death?
            
            And Euangelicall Esay tels
you, That as the raine commeth
downe, and the snow from Heauen,
and returneth not thither,
               Es. 55.
               but watereth the earth, and maketh
it to bring forth and budde,
that it may giue seede to the sower,
and breade to him that eateth.
So shall my Word bee,
that goeth out of my mouth, it
shall not returne vnto me voyde,
but it shall accomplish that which
I will, and it shall prosper in the
thing, whereto▪ I sent it, sayeth
the Lord God almighty. Neither
is this all, for a third puts
in his obiection, and sayeth:

If indeed Paul and Peter did
preach, there were no doubt
to be made of the happie issue
thereof. I answere,
            Yet we know that some
say d
                  •
                to Paul, and Peter his
Master, euen Christ Iesus,
when hee preached vnto thē
thus,Iohn. 8. 
               Thou hast a Diuel, At
what time hae rebuked them
of sinne, but these were crucifiers.
And Peter they sayde
was drunkē whē he spake out
of the plenty of Gods spirite,Act. 2.
which he had lately receyued;
but they that sayde so, were
Infidels;Act. 26. and Paul was accoū
               ted
mad when hee preached
of righteousnesse, of temperance,
and of iudgement to
come, but he that so esteemed
him was but a Pagan.
            Therefore wee may see,
that all such cauils as these, are
but the suggestions of flesh,
and bloud; and the delusions
of the Diuell of hell.
            
               
               
                  •
               agans shall condemne such

                  •
               espisers in the iudgement.
For the people of Lystra and

                  •
               f they had been Gods from
Heauen, calling the one
Iupiter, and the other Mercurius.
But beleeuing soules
entertain these Messengers of
saluation, as Angelles sent
from God. So did the beleeuing
Galathians receiue Saint
Paul, albeit he preached among
them in great infirmity
(as he himselfe confesseth)
yet had not the Law of God,
and nature for bad them, they
would haue pulled out theyr
own eyes to haue pleasured
Paul. Oh what is becom of the
kind acceptance of the former
ages that left all the endowments
now visibly to bee
seene in the Christian world,
for the continuance and
propagation of Religious

preaching for the seruice, and
ordinance of God, for the
proclamation of this mystery,
and for the dissemination
of the blessed seede of godlinesse
into all the world.
            Surely, the entertainement
of our forefathers of the wodden
Priests of Babylon (who
were indeede but Balaytes)
will rise vp and condemne
the sonnes, of their irreligious
profane, and base contempt
of the cleare & earnest preachers▪
of this sacred Mystery.
            But we will cease to vrge our
owne case, and appeale from
our condition among the
sonnes of men, to our Master
which is in Heauen, to whom
we eyther stand or fall. Blessed
bee his goodnesse for euer,
and his inheritance shall
neuer fayle, that we are assured
of.

say) of the English Nation among
others were these Gentiles.
            To vs (to vs I say) that inhabite

Isles of the World is the dore
of holy faith opened, and
Christ the expectation of the
Gentiles reuealed, our hearts

and Shephearde of our
Soules.
            Our English Nation being
at the first deliuered from the
blacknesse and darkenesse of
Gentilisme by their preaching
of this mystery of Godlines,

eyther by Ioseph of Arimathia,
or by Philip the Euangelist,
or as some recorde
by Priscilla and Aquila, or by
all of these.
            A remainder of that wretchednesse,
wherein we were
then plunged is continued,
yet amidst our Nation: for the
dayes of the weeke, (which
our children name) retayne
yet the brandes of infidelitie,
wherwith our whole nation
was then marked.
            The Heathen Saxons (and
such were we once) had gods
for euery day of the weeke.
The Sunne for the Prime day
of the weeke, and thereof
called it Sonday. The second
of the Moone, Moonday.
The third of Tuisch,
for so they called Mars,
Tuisch day. Of Wooden,
theyr Idoll, Woodensday. Of
Thor, their Iupiter, or Thur,
another Panim god, Thursday.

Of Freer,
               Of Wooden that Heathen Idoll remayneth at this day in some shires of England, a

                  rench called VVansditch which was

Fryday. And the last day

                  ersday,
another Saxon Idoll.
            From out of this Heathenish
infidelity, and bottomlesse
misery of blindenesse
and impiety.
            Loe the mercy of God
hath deliuered vs by this
preaching of this mysterie
of Godlinesse, the Gospell
of Christ, and hath made vs
Citizens of the Saints, the

            That the promise of
GOD made to Abraham,
as Tertullian reasoneth

might bee performed, which
was, That in him all the Nations
of the earth should be blessed;

twinnes might come to
passe, of whom it was sayde:
The elder should serue the younger;
which was indeed fulfilled,
(whereof Esau his seruice
to Iacob was a figure) when
the Iewes were reiected, and
serued the Gentiles, their yonger
brethren.
            The vse of this Saint Paul
doth largely exemplifie in the
ninth to the Romanes. The
Iewes were the true vine, we
the Gentiles were the wilde
branches of a wild Oliue. Are
they eiected, that wee might
bee receyued, are they broken
off; that wee might be engraffed.

            THat the World should

mystery of mysteries.
First, that the World should
beleeue in GOD, in the
vnitie of his essence, and Trinity
of existence, Then to beleeue
God in the verity of his
written word: And lastly,
to relye vpon God in the assurance
of his loue for his promise
sake: this (I say) to know
is eternall life, and for the
World to know it, is a world
of wonders.

               atred and bloudy cruelty of
many miscreants, and infidell
worldlings.
            So that now God hath
purchased by faith a world of
people to himselfe, called out
of the vniuersall masse, and
multitude of people in the
World, to know, and acknowledge
him to be their
God and Sauiour.
            This is the sence of these
words. And the sacred scriptures
call those the Worlde,
whom God hath thus called
out of the world, because
for their sakes onely this
world was made,2. Pet. 3. and this
world is as yet preserued,
and all things continue as
from the beginning.
            But when God hath

his full number of these his
chosen people out of the
world, then this world shall
haue an end, and there shall
bee a new Heauen, and a
new earth, wherein shal dwell
righteousnesse.
            To these his redeemed
people in the world, God
made his promises, both of
the promulgation, extension,
and augmentation of this
Kingdome of Iesus Christ
his Sonne.
            First, that the extention
thereof should be as large, as
is the expansion of the Heauens,
and so great, that it
should encircle, and surround
the earth.
            Secondly, that the dominion
thereof should bee from
sea to sea. And from the riuers
vnto the end of the world.

            For Christ Iesus the Sonne
of God, when hee made this
conquest of the World by
faith, did not proclaym to the
world (as king Cyrus did whē
he intented his conquests)
great pay, worldly promotions,
magnificent titles, and
honourable entertainements
for his voluntaries and Followers,
neither did Christ
proffer as the diuell did, All

to what number of women

men can (so they doe no
violence) to all that embrace
his Mahumetanisme,Turcissimus Papa, ait▪ Luth. nor yet
as the most Turkish Pope vseth,

indulgences from all kinde of
punishments, to all his Peccadilloes
whatsoeuer.
            For then Christ doubtlesse
might haue had followers on
a sudden more then enough.
But behold, and consider the
iniunctions, motions, and
perswasions that Christ vsed
to moue the world to beleeue
and then tell me (Beloued
in our Lord) if this be not a
secret and hidden Mysterie.

meant to follow him was, Re

he beleeues the Trinitie in

Vnitie, and Vnitie in Trinitie:
his answer is, because
the Scripture records
it, there is the word of faith,
but reply vpon him, and aske
him why he beleeues the scriptures,
his reason is, without
reason in himselfe, for he saith
The finger of God is there. If
you vrge and say. Why doest
thou beleeue, and I do not, I
heare the word as well as thee?
Saint Paule will answer with
an out crie, O depth! That is a
matter of amazement, not of
argument, saith S. Ambrose.
But what might be the cause
that stayeth and vpholds the
hearts of the sonnes of men
along the misery of this life
in this word of beleeuing?

                  •
               aith wee expect in the other
world. In respect whereof also
it is that this faith goeth not
alone, like some bankrupt, but
is royally attended with a
troupe of good works, semblable
to the causes thereof.
For the spirit of faith is not
barren, but is in continuall
motion in stirring and quickning
vp the harts of gods children
euery day to goodnes.
            Neither is the word of faith
verball onely,Heb. 4.

            The people of God therefore
whose hearts are thus powerfully

of faith to beleeue, and thus
effectually counselled by the
word of faith, to liue well,Act. 15.
endeauour nothing else but
that their liuing may be answerable
to their beleeuing,
that so their soules might bee
saued. For this sacred faith of
Christ, first of all purifieth the
heart; now if the fountaine be
cleare and cleane, the whole
streame that issueth thence
will be cleane also.
            Secondly, this faith of Christ
worketh by loue, and bringeth
foorth good workes. I
should euer therefore distrust
that I neuer was a true beleeuer,
vnlesse I felt my heart

            For the people then liued,
and beleeued, as men knowing
that the faith of Christ is
not fruitlesse, and that by the
fruites therof, they are assured
of their election past; and of
their perfection by Christ to
come: that their good deedes

should follow them where
nothing else

weldoing here, to be necessarie

but to goe on in that race of
goodnesse, that they might

end thereof, euen the reward

Boyes, and such damned

as make profession of faith,
the Oracle of faith telleth vs,1. Thes. 4.
               All haue not faith.
            
            God sent Noah in the worlds
infancie to preach this faith of
the Messias, Abraham in the

worlds childhood had the
signe of the couenant of this
faith for the same purpose,
Dauid in the worlds youth
beleeued, and defended the
same. The Prophets in the
worldes middle age guided
the beleeuers vnto it, Gods
owne Sonne in his first comming
preached it to the
worlds old age, his Apostles
and Preachers, to this our
age, the worlds dotage, and
all these found vnbeleeuers,
and missebeleeuers in all
their times. And last of all,
when Christ shall come againe
to iudge the liuing and
the dead: Shall he finde faith on
the earth?
            
            In his first aduent hee had
not (as he himselfe affirmeth)
where to lay his head, but
when he commeth againe to
iudgement, hee will not haue
where to set his foote, if the

               Africa was accounted in
auncient time the mother of
monstrous shapes, but Europe,
Christian Europe is become
the grandmother of many
strange wonderments. For,
as Saint Augustine sayth, Hee
that beleeueth not now, seeing the
world beleeueth, is aprodigious,
and portentous amazement to
himselfe.
            
            And many there are who
albeit they liue in the profession
of this holy beleefe, yet
they profite not in it, because
they abuse the holy meanes
thereof, neither doe they practise
the religious manner,
and methode of attaining vnto
it.

towards him, cryeth
out, Depart from mee for I am
a sinnefull man, as acknowledging
he was not worthy to

Christ was.
            
               Abraham, when hee

talkes with God about Sodome,
sayth thus, Let not my
Lord bee angrie, if I dust, and
ashes speake vnto him.
               Gen. 8.
            
            And the Syrophenician
comming to receiue comfort
from Christ, stands behind him
daring not to speake, but entendeth
onely to touch, not his
body, nor his garment, but euen
the very hemme of his
vesture, and shee receyued a
comfortable compellation
from Christ, for hee owned
her, and sayde, Daughter, bee
of good cheare, thy beleefe hath
saued thee.
            
            For the more vereeundious
and modest wee are in
this our hearing of God, and
in our comming vnto him,
the more bright and beautiful
wee are in his sacred sight. If
wee would thus serue the
Lord in feare, and reioyce be
fore him with trembling, wee
should not goe so often to

Church, and so often return
againe neuer the better, ofttimes
the worser, wee should
not so often heare in vain, nor
so often see, and not discerne.
            But the manner is now
with many to come, as sathan
did (for company or custom,
or worse) came also when
the sons of God were assembled
before him to the diuels
Chappell, according to our
English Prouerbe, Where God
hath his Church, the Diuell
hath his Chappell
            
            For euen in the great assemblies
while some are there
hearing the word attentiuely,
others sleepe profoundly,
while some reade, others
prate, while some lift vp their
eyes to heauen, others point
out the finger to note some
vanity in the next pue, while
som pray, othe
                  •
               s scoffe, while
some sing others curse, while
some sigh for their sinnes, others

laugh at sinne, & while
others sit hearkening to the
Sermon vnto the end, others
make hast to bee gone, and
thinke euery houre two, vntill
they heare the Peace of
God, which they will scarce
vouchsafe to take with them,
nor the Grace of GOD neither.
            Cease therefore to maruell
at our fruitlesse hearing
the Word, if this bee our demeanour:
when we present
our selues before our God;
were we perswaded of God,
as wee ought, (and surely, hee
that will come to God, must
beleeue that God is) and of
his sonne Christ Iesus, of
whom the voyce from Heauen
(and not from men) was
this, Heare him; wee could
not thus abuse our time,Mat. 17. when
wee assemble our selues to
heare this Word of faith preached
vnto vs.
            
               But those that thus de
               
                  •
               mean
themselues, the Prophe
               
                  •
               ie
of Esay is fulfilled, which
God in his iust iudg
                  •
               ment

                  •
               ringeth vpon them for their
neglect of him in making
their hearts fat, Their eares
heauie, and their eyes dimme,
that they may not see with
their eies,Esay. 6. nor heare with their
eares, nor vnderstand with
their hearts, and should bee
conuerted, and God should
heale them, These are such
that come into the house of
God without feare, and offer
the sacrifice of fooles, for albeit
they liue wickedly, yet
they imagine that they haue
made GOD beholding
vnto them for sitting an
houre or two in his seruice.
            It was otherwise in Saint
Iohn the Diuine,Apoc 1. who in heauenly
meditations and seruice
of God, was rauished
in the Spirite, on the Lordes

day, and in that holy extasie,
heauen was opened vnto
him, and hee saw God, the
Angels, the Elders, and the
soules of the Saints clothed in
white robes; whereas these
diuelish hearers are ready to
faint for water; yet sit (as Hagar
Abrahams bondmaide
did) by the fountaines of waters,
and doe not see them, &
are ready to perish for foode,
and yet doe not see the heauenly
Manna that is reached
out vnto them.
            And as they thus abuse the
holy meanes of their beleeuing▪
so also they vse not the
heauenly and orderly proceeding
in the practise of their
beleefe. For a true Beleeuer
at his very first awaking in
bedde, is present with God in
his thoughts, words and meditations,
as Dauid speaketh:
and after hee is vp, hee taketh
vnto him blessed wordes as

               
                  
                     •
                  head directeth eyther publike
               
                  •
               y
or priuately,Hosh. 14. and offereth

                  •
               God his morning sacrifice in

                  •
               prayer, and then addresseth
and addicteth himselfe to his
calling, and therein abideth,
performing his earthly vocation
with an heauenly mind.
            And if a true beleeuer
happen into any company, he
sits oft times still, and retired
to himselfe, watching and waiting
oportunity when hee
may speake words, that may
minister grace vnto the hearers.
            And if a true Beleeuer haue
any leysure (not that hee will
bee at any time idle) he sayth
to himselfe, Now will I retire
myselfe into my closet, and
there will I powre out my heart
vnto my God.
            
            If a true beleeuer prosper
in the worke of his handes, he
is thankefull, and not proude.
If hee suffer aduersity, hee

makes his patience knowne
vnto all men, without murmuring
or repining, assuring
himselfe that it proceedeth
not of Gods hatred, but of
his singular loue t
                  •
               ward him
that hee is afflicted, for
God delighteth not in the
misery of his Creatures, for
if hee did, hee would neuer
haue made man a Paradise
to liue in, euen in his innocency,
but God knoweth in
his wisedome, that by afflictions
his dearest children are
weaned from the loue of the
World, and take liking of the
other world.
            And thus hauing past the
day, recalling to mind Gods
great mercies, recounting his
owne many and manifold
infirmities and imperfections,
magnifieth Gods fauours in
all, craueth pardon for his
great vnthankefulnesse, and
so reposing himselfe in bedde

in his Sepulchre, hauing now
made, as it were, his last will
to God, acknowledging himselfe
a stranger, and Pilgrime
here, as all his Fathers were,
and beleeuing that the time
will come, that as he is awaked,
and riseth from bedde
in the morning: so shall he
bee raysed from his graue,
and sleepe of death, to
liue with GOD in Christeternally.
            But the vnbeleeuers and
fruitles professors in their carriage,
are quite contrary. For
their awaking is to euill, and
that is euer present with
them. Their morning Mattens
is cursing and swearing,
and that shall distill one day
into their bowels as water, &
like oyle into their bones.
            Their vocation is to bee
busie bodies in other mens
matters. Their society is to
seeke out the riotous

to runne with them to excesse,
their retirednesse is to
study out mischiefe, to complot
against their brethren, &
to circumuent by politique
stratagems their harmelesse
associates▪
            
            If these prosper, no man is
able to endure their pride,
their disdaine, their curiosity,
their statelinesse. If they bee
afflicted, the whole Countrie
shall ring of their impatience,

Lord, without the which, I cannot
please thee, without the which
I cannot hope for any good, nor
haue any euidence of these things
which are not yet euident, without
the which I cannot come to

this mercy vnto mee, without
the which I desire not to be, without
which I cannot bee, but a
Cimmerian wretch, a stranger
vnto thee, an Atheist, a profane
person, an Infidell, a cast away,

O Lord in the deepe, in the land
of obliuion, in the place of the
damned? Shall the dead praise

blessed plant of Paradise, O

be God, God began to be a
Man in subiection and humilitie,
and man to be God in

            For if God were humbled as
much as hee might be in that
he became Man, was not
Man exalted as much as hee
might be, in that he became
God? Herein vndoubtedly
appeared the wisdome, and
power of our God that his
Sonne in obedience to the
Father beeing abazed to the
lowest degree of humiliation
for vs, should by his owne
power (and not as Enoch and
Elias were by anothers power)
be exalted to the supreme
height of exaltation in the
sight of all the world both of
men and Angels.

brought them by the power
of his sufferings into the place

that thus Descended, is the

accompted but a most despicable

death, the punishment
due for our transgressions, euen
he that in the entrance
of this bottomlesse sorrow
had his soule heauy vnto the
death, and made strong cries,
and teares to bee deliuered,
and in the progresse thereof,
had clods of bloud breaking
from him, and when he was

               And this the power and
mighty hand of our God hath
wrought for vs to the glory
of his great name, which be
praysed and blessed for euer.

diuine, and humane natures

By Receiued vp, wee conceiue
not a momentany but by degrees
of time a locall motion
ascending from an inferiour
place to an higher, and by
Glory, is meant that hee was
exalted aboue these visible
heauens, and receiued throgh
the spheares, the cataracts of
heauen opening vnto him, euen
that hee might sit at the
right hand of God in great
Maiesty and highest glory for
euermore in the heauēs of the
blessed. The circūstāces of this
article of our Christian faith,
is most euidently in all the
particulars set down in holy

               it.
            
               The place where he was receiued
vp, was mount Oliuet
neere to Ierusalem, the cittie
where he was so abased, euen
there (there I say) was hee taken
vp into the glory of the
father in the sight of his cursed
enemies.
            The manner of his ascent
was,Act. 1. a cloud receiued him vp.
The heauens stoope downe
to doe homage vnto the heire
of heauen and earth. For by
the same power whereby he
made all things in the begining,
hee also lift vp himsele aboue
all things that are created.
            His passage naturall without
either change or diffusion
of his natures. His Session also
actuall. For according to his
true naturall being, hee sits at
the right hand of God, and
according to his personall being
he is euery where.
            The time of his ascent was

to the confirmation hereof
For as the truth of his ascension
is irrefragable, so the effects
thereof are vnutterable.
            For first, by his ascention
he hath opened heauen vnto
vs, that was shut against vs,Eph, 1.
and hath Made vs sit together
with him in heauenly places.
            
            Secondly, hee hath taken
possession of heauen for vs in
our nature,Ioh. 14. and in our names
as he told his disciples before▪
Saying, I goe to prepare a place
for you, and I will come againe,
and take you vnto me.

the superexcellency of which
place of happines we cā in no

but in possessing it in the other

                  •
               ee might haue entered himselfe,
but could not haue

brought vs in with him.
            Let vs then stand as it were
vpon the poynt of the promontorie
of Nebo, and looke
into the holy land, and revew
the lowest step in this
Iacobs ladder which is Christs
exinanition in the flesh: and
see how the power of God
hath made it knowne vnto
A
                  •
               gels, by celestiall vision,
and vnto men by degrees of
holy Christian faith, vntill it
hath brought vs vp vnto the
supereminent glory.
            Goe (I say) from his humanitie
in the flesh to his diuinitie,
a glimpse whereof was
seene in his transfiguration
on the mount, from his passion
on the crosse in his humiliation,
to his power in his
resurrection, from his minoritie
in respect of his Father,
to their qualitie in the height
of glory. Not that the deitie
in his ascent could bee exalted,

but that our nature in the
person of the Sonne of God
was first raysed vp from the
dead, and then receiued vp in
to euerlasting glory.
            When therefore we reade
that Christ was receyued vp
by a cloude, wee vnderstand
the cloudes of obsequiousnesse,
not any helpe it
afforded him (as the fierie
chariot did Elias) wee
conceaue the clouds seruice,
not any ayde it yeelded,
the cloudes ministery not any
assistance that it occasioned.
            For the matter or subiect
that ascended, is 
                  •
               properly
the humane nature of Christ,
for the deitie is neither contayned
in place, nor subiect
to motion.
            So the auncient Fathers
spake, The Sonne of God had of
ours whereby hee hanged on the

crosse, and of his owne, whereby
he ascended into heauen. For
the humane nature ascended,
and the ascent was
wrought through the power
of the diuine nature.
            And this is the cause that
Tertullian calleth Iesus the sequestrator
of God and man,
for of either party he had, that
was committed vnto him,
and he keepeth the pledge of
the flesh in himselfe the earnest
of all mankinde. For as he
hath left vnto vs the earnest
of the spirit, so he hath taken
from vs the earnest of the
flesh, & carryed it into heauen
as a pledge of the whole family
which hereafter shall bee
brought thither also.
            Thus is Christ our treasure
in heauen, and assuredly
where our treasure is, there
will our hearts be also.
            If Christ bee our treasur
                  •
               
               
let vs follow him in heart,
where hee is in body, let
vs follow him with paces of
loue, because his returne in
the iudgement day will bee
terrible.
            The hand writing that
was against vs is now cancelled,Gen. 1.
the curse was, Earth thou
art, and to earth thou shalt returne.
            
            But the blessing is purchased,Luc. 23.
               This day shalt thou be with
me in Paradise.
            
            Christ therefore in this
life by his grace doth ascend
vnto our hearts, when the
feare of the Lord of hoasts receiueth
therein plantation,
hee descendeth into our
hearts when wee take his
counsels to heart, hee issueth
from our hearts when
wee runne afrer him in our
affections in the sweete perfume
of his pretious oyntements

feeling our owne defects,
and againe, he ascendeth
aboue our hearts, when
by the eyes of holy fayth wee
see as with an Eagles eye
the prey a farre of (as Stephen
               Act 7.
did) euen Iesus standing
at the right hand of
God.
            Let the sanctified soule
come hither, and see it selfe
in heauen three manner of
wayes whiles it is on earth.
First, in conuersation, for,
Our conuersation is in heauen,
saith the Apostle.Phil. 3.
            
            Secondly, in our affe
                  •
               ctions.1. Ioh. 4.
               For they that abide
in charitie, abide in
God.
            
            Thirdly, by right of
possession. For Christ is ascended
to prepare vs a
place.
               Ioh. 14.
            
            Let the oppressed, and
distressed soule come hither,

and looke vp, Seeing wee
haue an high Priest which is
passed into the heauens, Iesus
the Sonne of God, let
vs hold faste our profession.
            For wee haue not an high
Priest that cannot bee touched
with our infirmities,
but was in all partes tempted
like as wee are, without
sinne.
            And albeit▪ wee reade
that Moses, and Samuel,
Noah, Daniel, and
Iob those holy men
were not powerfull to
preuayle with God in some
cases for others, yet no
where can it bee found
that our Lord Iesus Christ
had euer the repulse for
his chosen.
            For hee is the Sonne, in

                  •
               hom the Father is well

                  •
               leased.
            
               Let the curious questioner
come hither, and if hee
aske,Mat. 28. How is Christ with
vs vnto the end of the world,
as he promised, if he be receiued
vp in glory.
            I answer, that hee who
Was before Abraham,
               Ioh. 8. is
with vs by his grace, and
power of his holy spirit,
that liue in the faith of Abraham.
            
            His departure hence into
heauen beeing for our exceeding
great Comfort, and
benefite.
            For where should an aduocate
bee, but before the
Iudge pleading his Clyents
cause? where should a Captaine
bee, but fighting with
the enemies without the
Citie.
            And the father of a great
family doth not alwayes reside
at home, but trauelleth

into a farre country about his
affayres, to prouide for his
houshold.
            So Christ himselfe testifies,Ioh. 14.
               That vnlesse he depart the Comforter
should not come.
            
            Not vnlike the glorious
sunne of the firmament,
which when it is furthest
from vs in locall distance, it
is neerest vnto vs in power,
and effect, as appeareth in the
Summer season. For then
the beames of the Sunne
are more p
                  •
               ercing, albeit
it bee further of, because
then they are direct,
and perpendicular, which
in the Winter though the
body of the Sunne bee neerer,
yet the rayes thereof
are oblique and aside: Semblably
the bodyly presence
of Christ on earth wrought
not so effectually in his Apostles,
and other the faithfull,

as his holy spirit did after
his departure, which hee
powred out on them in great
measure, as hee promised,
for then were their hearts
throughly resolued, their
willes fully purposed, and
their zeales feruently onflamed.
            Yea let the most Seraphicall
and most Cherubicall
soules that liue, come hither,
and see what the Angels of
heauen admire at, who beholding
Christ Iesus ascending
with this glorious conquest
of his redeemed church
say but by way of admiration.
            Who is shee that looketh
foorth as the Morning,Cant. 6. bright
as the Sunne, pure as the Moone,
terrible as an Armie with ensignes.
            Nay blessed soules to
which of the Angels sayde

God at any time, as hee doth
to our Lord Christ Emanuell:
thou art my sonne: And againe,
I will bee thy Father
and thou shalt bee my Sonne:
yea, the Angels are commanded
to adore him, and the
son is bid to sit down at the
right hand of the Father in
the glory of heauen.
            Lastly, l
                  •
               t the simple
and honest soule come hither,
and learne not to seeke
Christ on earth in a Wafer
Cake (as the Popelings
doe) but as the Apostle
counselleth in heauen,
saying:
            If you bee risen with
Christ seeke those things that
are aboue where Christ sitteth
at the right hand of
God,Col. 3. and where hee must
bee vntill the times of the
restitution of all things which

God hath spoken by the mouth of
his holy Prophets since the world
beganne. Set therefore your
mindes on heauen, and heauenly
things, and not on earth, and
earthly things.
            Heauen is now opened,
enter thou into the holy of
holyest: for thou art, O my
soule, past the vtter and inner
Court. Thy Mediator
is in heauen, pray thou here
in earth, that hee may heare
in heauen, and speake for
thee.
            Our 
                  •
                flesh is in
heauen in the person of
Christ, whereby wee see
that the glory wee haue won
by Christ, is greater then the
disgrace and curse, that the
malice of the diuell, brought
vpon vs by Adam.
            
            The diuels malice
                  •
               , and
our sinne cast vs out of Paradice,
but Christs loue and

sufferings for sinne, makes vs
sit in heauenly places with
him.
            In a word, our triumph
is in heauen, who would not
fight the battaile manfully against
the flesh, the world, and
the diuell, being assured by
the captaine of the victorie.
            Wee may also hence perceiue
how God tenderly,1. Cor. 5. and
louingly dealeth with vs, euen
as Moses sayth hee dealt
with his owne people the Israelites.
            And how was that? euen
as the Eagle, sayth hee
doth with her young. The
Eagle couereth her young
with her winges, so God
doth with the winges of his
safe protection. She sometimes
perceiuing her young
ones dull, and drooping,
gently peckes them with her
becke, to stirre them vppe,

so God by afflictions doth
quicken his children, yea
sometimes the Eagle taketh
away her young ones meate
and flyeth vp into the ayre,
to entice and prouoke
them to practise, and endeuour
to soare on high-euen
so God the Father hath
receiued vp Christ Iesus our
heauenly Manna into glory,
that wee should learne
to aspyre and soare vpwards,
that where, hee is,
there wee might bee
also.
            And to this ende the
two Angells tolde vs at
his receiuing vppe into this
glory, that hee should in
the same manner descend
to iudgement in the ende
of the world, which wee
exp
                  •
               ct with patience, nay

               Apoc. 22. 
               Come quickly, and

wee doe nothing more seriously,
while wee are on
earth. but call to minde in
holy meditations the Lords
death, and shew it to the
eyes of our faith vntill his
comming againe, in partaking
of his blessed body &
bloud in the Sacrament; that
by the power thereof wee
may bee established, that we
turne not this great grace into
wantonnesse, nor neglect
our Lord Iesus, who is thus
exalted into the highest glory.
not for himselfe, (for he
had that glorie before the
world was) but for vs his
redeemed people: so that now
here is the exaltation and supereminent
height of faith,
euen euerlasting life.
            The Being whereof is
called Glorie, and our Estate
there Glorification. To this
doe all the goldly aspire, that
they may bee where Christ

Iesus is, to beholde his Maiesty,
and his glory in the
Kingdome of GOD the father.
            The Metropolis of which
Kingdome is the Heauen of
the blessed, the Confines are
Eternity, the chaire of Estate
is the thrones, the houses of
the Courtiers are the visions
of Angels and Saints, God
is there as the King, Christ
as the Prince, the Church as
the Queene, the Virgines as
the Handmaides, the Nobles
are the Patriarkes and Prophetes,
the Notaries are
Euangelists, the Prelates are
the Doctors of the Church,
the Souldiers are Martyres,
and the Subiects are all the
blessed.
            In which Kingdome are
all things to bee desired.
            Desire you riches?
Glorie & riches are in his house.
Desire you gold? The Citie

it selfe is of pure gold? Desire
you honour? O God,
               Apoc. 21. 
               such
honor as this glorie haue all thy
saints: Desire you pleasures?
At Gods right hand are pleasures
for euermore. Desire you
knowledge? In Christ are al
the treasures of wisedom, and
knowledge. Desire you Libertie?
Ierusalem which is aboue
is free. Loue you peace?
My people (sayth GOD)
shall sit in the beauty of peace,
and in the Tabernacles of my
protection. Desire you dainties?
You shall be satisfied when
his glory shall appeare. Desire
you wine? You shall bee filled,
with the plentie of this house:
and shall drinke of the riuers of
gladnesse. Doth Musicke delight
you? Here Cherubin &
Seraphin continually doe crie,
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of
Saboth.
            
            In a word, what delectable
thing soeuer can come

into mans imagination. It is
here in full aboundance to be
found: For God hath spoke
it, Come, and I will shew thee
all good. O wretched
sonnes of men, whose teeth
are sette on edge, with the
crudities of this world, that
they cannot taste of the delicacies
of that other world.
            
               For the Fathers haue eaten
sowre grapes, and the childrens
teeth are set on edge, as Ezechiel
speaketh.Ezech. 16. Wee must
therefore abstaine from the
rawe and vnwholesome
thinges of this Life, if wee
meane to confirme our
teeth, and conforme our
taste to sauour Heauen, and
these glorious thinges of
God.
            The best of Gods people
that euer were in the
world, could expresse the glory
of this place, but by Negatiues,
albeit they had an

extraordinary inspection into
it. Aske the Prophet Esaias,
and Saint Peter the Apostle,
they will tell you,
That the things which eye hath
not seene, neyther hath eare
heard, neyther came it into
mans heart, are which God
hath prepared for them that
loue him.
            
            And Saint Augustine
sayeth, That the things which
God hath prepared for them
that loue him. Our faith cannot
conceyue, our hope cannot
comprehend, our charitie
cannot apprehend: for it surpasseth
our thoughts, our vnderstanding
our desires.
            Let this bee our comfort,
that this glory may be
obtayned: expressed, or conceyued,
it cannot be.
            
               Augustine sayeth, that he
can tell sooner, what is not
there, then what is
there.
            
               When the Queene of Sheba
came to Solomons Court and
heard his wisedome, saw the
house which hee had built,
obserued his dyet, viewed
the dwellings of his seruants,
noted what seruants robes, &
the manner of their service,
and recounted the whole
burnt offerings which were
offered in the house of the
Lord euerie day. The text
sayth, that shee stood amazed,
and there was no Spirit
in her, and when shee came
to her selfe, shee vttered these
words.
            It is true that I heard in
mine owne land of thee, O King,
howbeit I beleeued not the report
vntill now I see it, but the
one half was not told me, for thou
hast more wisedome and prosperitie
then I heard by report.
            Right so, O my soule,
shalt thou say, when thou
commest into this heauenlie

Court, and beholdest and
knowest God, as he is known
and seest the new Hierusalem,
the Feast of the Lambe,
the Mansions prouided, the
milke white roabes of the
Saintes, their attendants vpon
God, and the continuall
Alleluiah sung by the quire
of Heauen, thou wilt say:
O it was not the least particle
of this glorie, that wee
heard of beneath, when we
were in the earth, for this glorie
farre surp
                  •
               sseth all that euer
wee heard or could imagine,
neyther indeed could
wee beleeue the same, but
now O King of Heauen assuredly
they are fully blessed
that alwaies stand before thee
and behold this thy Maiesty,
and surpassing glory.
            Hence was it, that Holy
men of God oft sighed, and
earnestly desired when they
meditated of this glory to be

with Christ. I desire to bee
dissolued, and to bee with
Christ, sayeth Paul. Aye mee
that I am constrayned to dwell
with Mesech,
               Psal. 120. sayeth Dauid.
And in another place.
            When shall I come and appeare
before the presence of the Lord,Psal. 42.
If I haue found grace in thy
sight, O Lord, shew mee thy
face, sayth Moses.
            And to this purpose God
sendeth his dearest children
bitter pilles of affliction ofttimes
in this life, to weane
them from the pleasures of
this world.
            The world troubleth
mee, saith S. Augustine, and
yet I loue it, what would I
doe, if it did not afflict me?
Surely it would befoole vs,
as it doth too many, who rather
then they would forsake
any part or parcell of the
World, they will desperately
and diuelishly forsake

their God, and the glory of
heauen, and in their hearts
wish God to keepe it for him
selfe, and let them enioy
their pleasures and pastimes in
this present life.
            O blinde and barbarous
folly of the sonnes of Adam,
who hath bewitched you?
Would you see the inuisible
things of God? They are
seene sayth Paul, by the visible
God, being considered in
his workes. Christ is receyued
vp in glory,Rom. 1 ascend thou
by these degrees vnto
Christ, O my soule, that he
hath reuealed vnto thee.
            Say vnto thy selfe,
when thou viewest the
world, and the glory thereof
both in the frame of Heauen,
and in the fabrique of
the earth.
            If O Lord, thou grantest
vnto vs such goodlie
thinges in this our prison:

what hast thou prepared for
vs in thy pallace of Heauen.
If here thou affoordest so liberally
thy blessings, both to
friendes and foes, what hast
thou prouided in heauen for
friendes onely?
            When thou beholdest the
surpassing beauty of the heauens,
say, O my soules, How
delectable are thy dwellings, O
Lord of Hosts, my Spirite fainteth
for desire to dwell in the
Courts of thy house for euermore.
For all Nations are before
thee, as nothing, and they
are accounted lesse then nothing
and vanity.
            
            When wee consider again
that there are three principall
places in this vniuerse,
to witte, Hell, the World,
and Heauen.
            The first vnder the earth,
the second aboue the earth,
the third aboue the visible
heauens. The first a place of

darkenesse, the second a place
mixt both with light & darknesse,
the third is altogether.
light. The 1. a dungeon of despayre,
the second a vale of
teares, the third a Paradise of
incomparable delights, and
delicacies, whose heart desireth
not after those waterbrookes?
whose soule seeketh
not after those ioyes of Heauen,
where is the fulnesse of
ioy? and happinesse for euermore.
            For there is health without
sicknesse, youth without
age, fulnesse without famine,
plenty without penury, g
                  •
               ory
without infamy, peace
without warre, and in a word
all good without euill.
            Now therefore O yee
sonnes of men, Marke Sayth
Saint Augustine, Heauen is to
bee solde, and God requires
no other price for thee to buy
it, but thy selfe, it is worth

so much as thou art, giue
God thy selfe, and thou shalt
haue it.
            But obserue, thou must
not present thy selfe to God
in this exchange a worldling,
a sinner, a cast-away, but
thou must become iust,
good, holy, and worthy of
the same, not of thy selfe,
but beeing iustified, sanctified,
and bettered by the holy
faith, and Spirit of thy
God in Christ Iesus, in
whom wee all are accounted
worthy, so shalt thou by his
merites obtaine a Kingdom,
where the fire dooth not
burne, nor the ayre infect,
nor the water drowne, no

where there is no commet
to presage thee euill, no
thunder to terrifie thee, no
lightning to daunt thee, no
thunderbolt to consume thee
no tempest to affright thee,

Christ Iesus, vnto, and into
this glorie, and bee not discouraged

long distance from you, or

to liue in, the Wombe, this
Earth, the Heauens. In the

monethes.
            In the earth a place

of greater extent, and a longer
season, some seauentie
yeares.
            And lastly, in Heauen
a place of extent, without limit,
and for terme without
time, euen for euer and euer.
            And as the second place
farre exceedeth the first, both
in largenesse of Extent, and in
continuance of time, so the
third place of our most happie
being, incomparably surpasseth
the second in both;
for it is without limmit of locall
scite, and without all determinatiō

of dayes.
