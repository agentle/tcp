whych are my disciples be knowne
by my cognisaunce in lyke maner,
whych is loue comminge oute of a
pure herte,i. Timoth. i. and a good cōsiēce, and
a fayth not fayned.
            And as Christ hym selfe dyd inculke
& beate in nothyng so moche,
as pure loue and feruēt charite, so
dyd the Prophetes & Apostles in al
theyr sermons & wrytinges, aboue
all thinges exhorte men to mutual
loue, yea & yt vnfayned as we maye
se in theyr prophecies & Epistles, in
somoch that S. Paule sayth,
                  
                     •
                  . Cor. xiii. that
though he could speake wt the tonges
of mē & aungles, & yet had no
loue, he were euē as soūdyng brasse
or as a tinglyng cymbal. And
though he could prophecie & vnde
                  •
               
               stond
al secretes & al knowledge,
and had al fayth so that he coulde
moue moūtaynes oute of theyr places

& had not loue, he were nothīg,
And though he bestowed al his goodes
to fede the poore, yea & though
he gaue his body euen to be burnt,
& yet had no loue it profyteth hym
nothynge.wtout charite nothīg pleasethe God. The excellencye of thys
christen loue muste nedes be great
& inestimable, seynge that wtout it
no thing is acceptable in the syght
of God, though it be iudged of the
world to be a worke of neuer so hye
and singulare meryte.
            Of this loue christ dyd prophecy
that it shoulde waxe colde in y• hartes
of many nowe these last dayes,Mat. xxiiii.
& that wickednes should abound &

chrystē loue towarde God and our
neyghbour reygneth but in the hertes
of a few. And that they haue no
thynge lesse than that true & workyng
fayth, which the holy scriptures
cōmēd so hyghly in euery place.
For the christen fayth worketh by
charite,
                  
                     ••
                  ll
                     •
                  . v. sayeth saynt Paule. Nowe
in asmuch as the fayth, wher of so
many hoste nowe a dayes, worketh
not this charite or loue in them, it
is manifest & an euident argumēt,
that theyr fayth,
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . ii. as S. Iames calleth
it, is a dead fayth, ye is, a fayth
in name but not in dede. Yf there
were true & liuish fayth, thā would
it worke loue in theyr hertes, both
toward God & theyr neighboures.
Agayne,Roma. xv. if ther were such a law as
is the fulfyllynge of the loue,i. Timo. i. than
wold it whan tyme requireth,Psal. i. and
an occasyon is gyuen, shewe forth
it selfe by eternall operacyon. Who

can iustly affyrme y• he loueth God,
& yet worketh not his wyll, nor yet
walketh not in ye waye of hys moost
godly cōmaundementes, he y• sayth
I knowe hym, & kepeth not his cō
               maundement
sayeth saynte Ihon,i. Ioh. ii.
is a lier, & the trueth is not in him.
But he that kepeth his worde, truly
in him is ye loue of God perfecte.
Agayne thys is ye loue of God that
we kepe his cōmaundementes. Beholde
S. Ihon sayth,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                that the loue
of God is in none, but in them only
whiche do his wyll. Neyther do
Christes sayenges dyffer from this:
If ye loue me,Ioh. xliii. sayeth he, kepe my cō
               maundemētes.
He that hath my cō
               maundementes
& kepeth thē, he it
is that louethe me. If ony man loueth
me,Ioh. xv he wyll kepe my word. He
that loueth not me, kepethe not my
wordes. If ye kepe my commaūdementes,
ye shall abyde in my loue.

Ye are my freendes, yf ye do theyse
thynges y• I cōmaunde you. Christ
sayeth here playnely,He louethe Christ that kepeth hys worde. that whosoeuer
hath an herty & precordial loue
toward hym, kepeth his cōmaundementes:
but yf any do the contrary,
surely he loueth not christ. How
than may theyse men be recounted
& iudged to loue Christ, whan they
go not about to fulfyll one poynte
of his worde?
            Hys worde is that they shoulde
loue him wt all theyr herte,Exod xx. Deut. vi. Mat. xxii. Philip. iii. mynde,
soule & strēgth but in ye stede of him
they loue them selues, theyr carnall
pleasures & wordely vanyties, the
ende wherof is dampnacion.Deut. v.
            
            His word is that they should honour
& reuerence Gods moost holy
& blessed name,Of swerīg 
                     •
                  ote. but they omittynge
the iuste honour of it, blaspheme it,
rayle on it, & wickedly sweare by it
to ye great defasynge of gods glory,

so muche as lyeth in theyr power.
For thorowe theyr wickednesse the
name of god is styl blasphemed,Esai. vi. railed
vpon,Eze. xxxvi. & euel spoken of,Roma. ii. as the holy
scriptures saye. Yf christen princes
do not shortely fynde some remedy
to exyle & banysh thys moost detestable,

Certes it is to be feared, yea
we may be certayne, that God wyl
powre out vpon vs his vengeaūce
& plage vs greuously, although we
haue not wanted, nor yet dayly do,
dyuers tokens of hys fearce anger

shoulde sanctify the Sabboth day,

despyse Gods word, are lyke to the

than to be in the seruyce of god eatyng

& vncleanly wordes, hurting greatly
the chaste eares of other.
            
               
And as for theyr pastymes, they
are such as rather moue & entise to
dishonesty than honesty. What shal
we nowe saye?Mat. xxiii. Is not the loue of
many colde, accordinge to Christes
prophecy? All seke theyr owne & not
that which is Iesus christes.Philip. i
                     •
                  . They
loue the glory of men,Ioan. xii. more thē the
glory of God. Thus se we that they
haue no loue towarde GOD. For
though they say y• they knowe god,
yet wt theyr dedes they denye hym,
for so much as they are abhominable
& disobedient,Titum. i. and vnmete to all
good workes.
            Nowe seynge that theyr loue is
so colde toward God, what is to be
thought of theyr loue toward their
neyghbour? which necessarely folowethe
of the loue of God.Note. Can floudes
of water cōtinually flowe oute
of a place, where there is no heade
sprynge? Neyther can ye true & christen

loue towarde our neyghboure
be in that herte, whiche is wtout all
loue of God.i. Ioh. v▪
                S. Iho
                  •
               
               ̄ sayeth, whoso
euer loueth hym that begat, loue
hym also whyche was begotten of
hym. It foloweth therfore that for
asmuch as they loue not god, as we
haue heard before, neyther do they
loue his creature. For yf they dyd
loue the creature of God. I meane
theyr neighbour surely, they would
expresse it by externall operacion &
outward dedes. Colde is that fyre,
yea rather there is no fyre, which cō
               tayneth
not in it y• vertu & strēgth
of burnyng. Sēblably cold is that
loue, yea rather it is no loue whiche
contayneth not in it the vertu and
strength of workynge. The preest &
Leuyte (as we read in the gospel of
Luke) sawe a man which was robbed
& woūded so greuously that he
was left half dead,Luke. x. yet they moued

with no cōpassion toward him. passed
by, & helped nothyng his miserable
state. But a Samaritane commyng
that waye, & seynge the woū
               ded
mā in so great misery, sorowe &
payne, was streyght wayes moued
with pitie, & commynge vnto hym,
bounde vp hys woundes tenderly,
powred in oyle & wyne, & layd hym
vpon his beaste, brought hym into
an Inne, and made prouyson for
hym. Nowe chaunsed it. y• all they
thre seynge this man in suche miserable
case, were not alyke moued to
helpe this mā?To lo
                     •
                  e y• we haue toward god, maketh vs to loue our neyghbour The preest & Leuite
were mercylesse, the Samarytane
was mercyfull. Uerely in the Samaritane
was y• loue of god, whiche
excited & moued him agayn to shew
loue towarde his neyghbour. But
in the preest & Leuyte was ther no
loue toward god, therfore had they
no pytie & cōpassiō vpō theyr neighbour.

So y• where the loue of God
wanteth, ther can the loue of oure
neyghboure haue no place. And to
saye y• trueth, I thynke surely that
accordinge to Christes prophecy, y•
loue of manye was neuer so colde,
For whan was there euer so many
fayre wordes,Mat. xxliii. Of dissimulacion. Psa. xi. & so much dissimulacioon?
who can at this daye vnfaynedly
know his frende frō his 
                  〈◊〉
               ?
al trueth is vtterly decayd among
the chyldren of mē. Euery one speaketh
lyes to theyre neyghbour, theyr
lyppes are deceytfull, they speake
one thynge & thynke an other.Iere. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . In
theyr mouthe they speake peace wt 
theyr frend, & yet secretely they lay
in wayte for him,Iere. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . They stretch out
theyr tonge as a bowe of lying, and
not of trueth. As the folowers lay
snares to take byrdes, so do they
laye snares & trappes to take men.
And as the trappe is full of byrdes

so are theyr houses full of disceyte.
Nowe is the tyme come that Christ
speaketh of in the holy gospel. The
brother (sayeth he) shall betray the
brother vnto the deathe,Math. x. y• father y•
sonne, & the chyldren shall aryse aagaynst
theyr fathers & mothers, &
shal putte them to deathe.Mat. xxvi. Manye
are become ryght Iudasies, that is
frendes in pretence, & extreme enemyes
in theyr workes, so y• almoost

& adulterers God shal iuge,
Therfore can not we escape, except
we repent, & leaue this great abhomynacion
of fylthye & vncleane lyuynge.
            Thus se we euydentlye that the
loue of oure neyghbour is colde in
y• hertes of many, euē as we hearde
before of the loue of God. For who
can loue his neyghbour & dissemble
with him, be vnmercyful vnto him,
couyt his goodes, & abuse his wife,
doughter or mayd. These be manyfeste
tokens, not of loue, but of hatred.

So yt we maye perceyue y• prophecye
of Christe to be true, whiche
sayth,Mat. xxii
                     •
                  
                that in the last dayes, iniquite
shal abound or be plenteous, and
the loue of many shall waxe colde.
            Some men wyll meruayle peraduenture
howe it cōmeth to passe
yt the loue both towarde God & our
neyghboure shoulde thus decaye in
these last dayes, seyng that God is
nowe no lesse beneficial, gentle, boū
               teous,
and mercyfull to vs, than he
hath ben in tymes paste to our predecessors.

saye, deserueth lyke loue.The

                   decayeth. Certes so
ofte as I consyther with my selfe ye
great decaye of christen religion, &
ye better subuerciō almoost of al godly
lyuīg, me thīke yt two thīges are
the chiefe & principall causes. The
fyrst is, the want of yt knowledge of
our selues. The second, the want of
the knowledge of God. For the first

poynte of wisdom by the cōmon cō
               sent
of all learned men, is ye knowledge
of our selues.Nosce te ipsum. Nowe yf we do
not knowe what we are of our selues,
verely we can neuer know god
arighte, nor yette haue anye delectacion
or pleasure in hym. And yf
we do not delyght in hym,
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  
                how can
we loue hym? For who loueth that
thyng wherin he hath no pleasure?
Therfore ye next & moost redy way
to make vs for to loue GOD, is to
lerne to knowe our selues.Math, ix. Who felyng
hymselfe sycke & sette in great
daunger of his helth, desyrethe not
the helpe of a Phisicion? Yf we dyd
knowe y• so many of vs as be borne
of the seed of Adam,Ioh. iii. Ephe. ii. be borne verye
flesshe of flesshe, vnpure, vnhalowed,
abominable before GOD, the
sonnes of wrath, wrapped in infynite
errours, set round about with
corrupt affecciōs, not able to thīke

a good thought of our selues,ii. Cor. iii. Roma. vii. moch
les of power to worke any goodnes
breathing nothing but the fruytes
of synne, vnable eyther to thynke,
lust or employe oure selues to any
good thynge,The knowlege of our selues maketh vs to fly to god▪
                but that is vngodly,
croked vnequall, & vnpure, so that
we se nothyng but ye fearce wrath,
the greuous iudgement, ye extreme
vēgeaūce of God, sinne, deth, hel, desperaciō,
laid out & prepared for vs
accordīg to our desertes, yf we had
this knowledge, I saye, of oure selues,
thā would we moost hūbly fal
downe before our LORDE God, comfessyng
how beggerly & miserable
we are of our selues, sekynge at his
goodnes, grace, fauoure, peace, remission
of synne, tranquilite of conscience,
& all confortable thynges yt
shoulde make vnto oure saluacion,
yea than would we cōfesse that our
destruccion commeth of our selues

and that all our helpe commethe of
God only.

moost parte of mē wāt this knowledge
of them selues, therfore stand
they well in theyr owne conceyte,
please them selues well, make much
of theyr owne actes, be they neuer
so vnpure. These Iusticiaries thīk
themselues ryghteous, as y• proude
& arrogant Pharise dyd in the gospell
of Luke,Luk. xviii. & therfore haue they
no part of christes deth.Mat. ix For Chryst
sayeth: I came not to call the ryghteous,
that is, such as iustify them
selues, & thīke yt they be made sufficientlye
ryghteous by theyr owne
good dedes, merytes and desertes,
but synners to repentaunce. And
this want of the knowledge of thē
selues, makethe that they can not
feale the goodnes of God, nor perceaue
wherfore christ serueth, wherfore
he was borne, why he dyed, for

what cause he rose agayne.marke what y• knowledge of our selues doth. And
therfore is the loue of God colde in
thē. For yf they dyd knowe thē selues
perfectely, & were perswaded yt
theyr whole saluacion dependeth altogither
of the goodnes of God the
father thorowe Iesus Christe oure
LORDE & sauiour, thā woulde they
with all theyr herte loue God, plese
God, delyte ī God, & seke ye glory of
god aboue al thing. Yea thā should
this theyr loue towarde God be so
feruent & mighty in operaciō, that
euen of very loue agayne, & with a
wyllynge spirite, they shoulde loue
theyr neyghbour euen as them selues,
& employe al theyr diligence to
accōplysshe Gods moost holy wyll,
& that not of feare,i. Ioh. i
                     •••
                  
                but of loue. For
perfecte loue casteth out feare.
            And would God that al prechers
woulde vse this trade & maner in
theyr sermons, that is to saye, fyrst

teach men to know thēselues, that
they maye perceyue theyr owne misery,
wretchednes and damnacion.
Secondly declare vnto them that
ther is no way to escape this great
daunger, but only to flye to Gods
mercye, & there to seke remedy thorow
Iesus christ. Yf they dyd thus
surely it would kyndle in mens hertes
a meruaylous feruente loue towarde
God, & an vnspekable redynes
to walke in the LORDES pathe
wayes, and so hertely to loue theyr
neyghbour, that they would wyshe
no lesse kyndenesse to theyr neyghbours

            For whan they consithered y• great

that whan we were in a dampnable
state, he freelye of hys owne

mere goodnes saued vs, & made vs
heyres of eternall glory, they could
none otherwyse do but loue hym agayne,
& employ them selues to accomplysshe
that thinges that he cō
               maundeth,
whiche is to loue oure
neyghboure, and to walke in a new

vnkyndnes for kyndnes? Who
hateth, where he is loued? Mē therfore
hearynge this vnspekable loue

               ¶Gabriel the Aungel and Embassadour
of god speaketh.
               
                  WHerfore are ye sadde o
ye men mortall? Wherfore
do ye walke as persons
desolate dismayd
& altogyther conforteles?
Wherfore do ye sygh, wepe, sob
and take thought. Wherfore do ye
wrynge your handes, & teare your
heere? Whye rather do ye not reioyce?
Why do ye not eleuate and
lyfte vp your heades, walkyng plesaūtly?
Why do ye not loke wt smylynge
countenaunces? Whye do ye
not putte oute of youre hertes all
thought & care? Why do ye not so cō
                  pose
& set youre selues, that all the
gesture of youre body maye frāckely

& wyth a lustye courage, declare
youre ioye, myrth, gladnes, felicite
and pleasaūce? Ther is, beleue me,
not one cause of sadnes: but of gladnes
many ye & innumerable. For
God is nowe nomore an enemy vnto
you,The great loue of god toward vs but a dere frende. He is become
of a cruell iudge, a mercifull
sauyour, & of an austere and fearce
LORDE, a bounteous and gentle father,
of an extreme reuenger, a tender
forgyuer, to be shorte, he is now
become the very same vnto you, y•
a moost tender, moost gentle, moost
louynge, moost bounteous, mooste
kynde, moost benefycial, moost liberal,
most benygne father is to y• his
natural sonne, whome he moost int
                     •
                  erlye
loueth, and tenderly inhalseth
aboue al the other. Howe therfore
can ye be sadde? Howe can ye
any otherwyse than reioyce and be
mery, seynge that al doloure, all so

rowe, all care, all grefe, all payne, al
perrell, all trouble, all daunger, all
disquietnes, all hatred, all malyce,
all emnite, all maliuolence, all euell
wyll, all wrathe, all displeasure, all
desyre of vengeaunce, and all that
euer is cōtrary to your ioye & pleasaunce,
to your health and cōforte,
to your rest and tranquilitie, is vtterly
extinguysshed & so put awaye
for euer and euer, that you whiche
are of Gods faythful cōgregaciō, obediēt
to his word, & redy to accomplysshe
his moost holye and deuyne

maye be made inherytours of eternall

God ye father thorow Iesus Christ,
that these synguler benefytes may
not at any tyme seme to be shewed

vnto ingrate and vnthankeful personnes.
               Me thinke I se you nowe begin

of these moost pleasaunt and

to me is no vulgare delectacion &
smale pleasure.
               But that you maye reioyce vnfaynedlye,
& knowe that ye in dede
haue an vrgente & weyghtye cause
to be glad, yea and that with a contynuall
myrth, and suche a ioye as
ought to be immortall & neuer dye:
I wyl reherse to you in what damnable
state ye were in,The knowldge of our selues maketh vs to fle vnto christ for socoure. before these

of all goodnes, bent to al myschefe,
the sonne of perdicion, a fyre brand
of hell, a vessell of yre and wrathe.
All these thynges dyd God tell before
to Adā,Rom. ii. that he myghte be prudent,Ephe. vi,

yea rather theyr eyes should be opened,

of faythful vnfaythfull, of spirituall,

of God the sōne of the dyuell, of the
heyre of glory the heyre of damnacion.Psal. xlviii.
Alas whan man was in honour
he perceyued it not, and therfore is
he nowe becomme euen lyke vnto a
brute beast.Gene, vi. He is altogyther wythout

the spiryte of God, he is all carnall
and fleshelye, therfore can not
gods spiryte abyde in hym,i. Cor. ii. neyther
can he perceyue those thynges that
pertayne to the spirite of God, yea
& that is more to be lamented, not
Adam alone is fallen into this dāpnable
state,Rom. v. but also al his posterite.
For thorowe this his faulte & wycked
synne,Gene. iii. all the earth with the inhabitātes
therof are accursed.All we are dāpned in Adam. So
that so many as come of thys olde
Adā, are dāpned, cursed & throwen
from the fauour of God. This one
transgression of Gods cōmaundement
hath made you al subiecte to
the yoke & tyranny of Satan,ii. Cor. v. and
bonde to euerlastynge damnacion.
Adam is youre father, and you are
his childrē. Loke therfore in what
case he is, in the very same are you.
Adā is carnall,Ioh. iii. therefore are ye carnall.
Adam is wicked,Ephe. ii.. therefore are

ye wycked. Adam is the sonne of
wrathe, therfore are ye the sōnes of
wrath. Adā is a lyer & nothing but
vanite,Psal. xv. therfore are ye liers and no
thyng but vanite. Adā is captyue
& bonde prisoner to Satan, synne,
deth & hell, therfore are ye captiues
and bond prisoners to Satan, syn,
death and hell. Howe can it otherwyse

of thornes, or fygges of briers?
So lykewyse euery good tree bryngethe
for the good fruyte: but a corrupt
tree bringeth forth yll fruyte.
A good tree can not bryng forth yil
fruyte, nother a corrupte tree good
fruyte. Euen as it is impossible for
a sower crabbe tree to brynge forth
sauery and swete apples, so is it impossible
for a synfull man drowned
and buryed all in synne, I meane
Adā, to beget any other thē synnefull,

vngodly and wicked chyldren.Luke. vi
A good tree oute of the good treasure
of his herte,Math. xii. brīgeth forth that
which is good. And an yll man out
of the yll treasure of his herte, bryngeth
forth that which is yll. Nowe

he brought forth, mu

this one mā Adā, euel was brought
forth vpon all men vnto dāpnaciō.
By the dysobedyence of hym were
ye all made synners,Ephe. ii. and by nature
the sonnes of wrathe. For this one
mānes faulte dyd synne enter into

and so came death vpon all men,Rom. v. in
so muche as all ye haue synned.Psal. l. Ye
were therfore begotten in synne, cō
                  ceyued
in synne, & brought forth in
synne. None of you al are pure, but
euery one is polluted wyth vngodlynes.Rom. iii.
Ther is no differēce, all haue

synned, and want the glory of god.
Ye are corrupte and become abhominable
in youre studies,Psal. xiii. there is
not one that doth good, no not one
for the LORDE hath loked from heuen
vpon the children of men, for
to se yf there were anye that hathe
vnderstandynge or seakethe after
God. But all are fallē from y• true
waye, they are become all togyther
vnprofitable,Rom. iii. there is not one that
doth good no not one. Their throte

What remedy? What shyfte wyl ye

Whyther wyll ye go from hys spyrite.
Whyther wyll ye flye from his

Your syn hath made God angry w^

of the flesshe is death. Yea the
