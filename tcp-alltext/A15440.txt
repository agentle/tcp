                presently suppressed by the tyrannie of the Duke of Alba, and Spaniardes.
            
               
                  MOste Soueraigne Lorde, your▪ Maiesties most obedient and lamē
               ting subiectes of the low Countries, as they haue often pondered with thē selues, the natural affection and fatherly good inclination, which your Maiesty hath (since the time that your grace by the power of almighty God receyued the dominion and regiment of the sayd countreis) always and continually shewed: so haue they had a sure hope and vndoubted affiaunce, that your Maiesty as well vpon their daily complaynts and lamentations, as vpon the pitifull declarations and remō
               strances of some christian Princes and Potentates vnto your Maiestie, mercifully haue considered of our pitifull and most miserable

suppressiō, wherwith we by reason of the great and vnsupportable force, arrogancy, and wicked regiment of the Duke of Alba are suppressed, and mercifully haue regarded the most miserable ruine and destruction of these your naturall low countreys, who alwayes haue béen most faithful and obedient, both to your Maiesty, and also your Graces predecessours. Not doubting but that your Maiestie would gréeuously haue béen moued, that hée vnder pretence of protecting and defending the Romish religion, vnder the colour of your Maiestyes name, should presume to frustrate & breake all the priuileges, customes, and rightes, wherunto your Maiesty and your predecessours haue sworne, persecuting your faithfull subiects in body and goods, and destroying your countreys, in none other sorte, but as if he had declared himselfe to be an open enemy of your Maiesty and the subiects of the same.
            Therfore haue they always earnestly attended, that your Maiesty no longer suffering the sayde force, woulde haue prouided some conuenient meanes for the safegarde of your countreys, and deliuerance of your poore and suppressed subiects, and haue a respect to the dutifull office of a kinge, whom the almightie God, the kinge of all kinges,

hath placed and ordeyned as a protectour of the righteous, and a fatherly pastor of the people vnder your subiection, to defend and preserue them from all force and violence: and likewise to remember the manifolde and faithfull seruices, which your sayd coū
               treys and subiects, haue from time to time most faithfully done to your Maiestie and your predecessours.
            But they now (to their extreme gréefe) considering that all their former supplications are as nothing regarded and in vaine, and that al other the remonstrances of sundry Princes and Potentates, haue sortid no such effect as might haue turned to their comfort and consolation, and they in their consciences assuring themselues, that your Maiesty hath no reasonable occasion vpon euill will or displeasure▪ so to alienate and turne your selfe from your lamentable subiects: can not but vndoubtedly suspect, that through malyce and false information of some, who hauing more regard to their priuate lust and appetite, than to the seruice of your Maiesty, haue daily laboured to bring your Maiesties countreys into your displeasure. Wherin they haue alwayes most manifestly and vnfainedly pretended and trauayled, not onely by letting and defending that our humble supplications and faithfull

warnings should come to your Maiesties eares, misconstruing the same to the worst, and peruersly accusing them to your Maiesty, therby to bring the cuntrey into discention and commotion, & so vnder your name to suppresse and make desolate the same, & so with the goods and blood of your subiectes to quench their gréedy & vnsatiable apetite.
            This is that (O most soueraigne Kinge) which your saide subiects doo, and haue not without occasion estéemed to be the greatest calamitie that might happen vnto them, as considering that the way and meanes wherby they might complayne and shewe their griefes to your Maiestie, as to their bountifull and naturall Protector (so by God appointed as a refuge in their extremitie) is by the vngodly dealing of their ennemies taken away from them: a thinge which all wayes hath béen permitted to vnreasonable creatures: namely to suffer them in their extremitie and néede to sue for remedy and redresse.
            And therfore, although they had resolued and taken in hand with patience to attende the time of redresse, thinking that your Maiestie would at last haue opened your eares and eyes to heare and see their miserable estate, from which your Maiestie by reason of their saide euill willers is nowe letted.

But now considering in the ende their suppression, the longer the more to encrease & to become more vnsufferable, tending not onely to their damage and destruction, but also of your Maiesties heritage and countreys, which in times past haue florished in all prosperitie, and now come to ruine: they could not for the faithfull obedience and aliance sake wherin they are bounde to your Maiesty and their natiue countrey, but now once againe by writing, request your Maiesty to consider and weigh the originall occasion of the desolation of your countries, & by whose means the same is come to passe, and consequently execute the office of a true King, in defending the righteous, and deliuering your countries from this tiranny & oppression.
            And first we humbly beséech your Maiestie to call to mind and consider, that these your countries in times past hauing bene deuided amongst sundry Lords and rulers, are since by mariadges, agréements, & mutuall treaties, in time, and orderly by lawfull succession and conueniences come vnder the house of Burgondie, and afterwards, by meanes of mariages contracted with the most famous house of Austria, and consequētly allied with the most mighty kingdome of Spaine
               ▪ yet alwayes with expresse

condition, that euery and singular the countries and prouinces should possesse and enioye their owne policies rightes and liberties in times past accustomed, without that any prouince or countrie should be burdened of the dominion of the other, or by any meanes be depriued of their customes or liberties, but be bound ioyntly to liue one with another vnder one Prince and head, as many children vnder one father, to the intent with one accorde to defend their Prince & common weale against all straū
               gers and foraine force.
            Also the Princes of the countrie willing as fathers to shew and declare their loue & affectiō to euery one, did at their solemnisation and entring into their dominion & rule, by a solempne othe, bynd themselues to vse and kepe eche countrie in their rightes and franchises, without suffring that any of them should be enfringed or deminished, or that the one Prouince should haue dominiō or rule ouer the other, much lesse be subiect vnto any foraine dominion or power: vpon which conditions he is accepted and taken as a supreme Lord and Gouernour ouer ye countries, and theruppon receaueth the othe of obedience and faithfulnesse of his subiectes.
            Of which the premises néedeth not any

further or larger rehersall, whilest that vndoubtedly your Maiestie doth sufficiently remēber, how that the Emperour Charles, of most noble memorie, following the presidentes of his predecessours, and acknowledging that the sayd othe of solempnisation is the onely and right foundation, vppon which doth consist aswell the might, & authoritie of a Prince, as the faith and obedience of his subiects, did in his life time, and presence of your Maiestie, cause your Maiestie to receaue the sayd countries vnder ye sayd othe, and sware your Maiestie to the ioyfull income in all the landes and most of the townes, as next successour and onely heire of his emperiall Maiestie: and afterwardes the same Emperiall Maiestie departing out of these countries, and your Maiestie receauing the full dominion, and administration of the Land: did once again, in presence of the Deputid of the countries then assembled, rehearse and strongly confirme the saide priuileges. So that in all times past the sayd countries haue enioyed and bene ruled by their former priuileges & liberties.
            Out of which hath followed such faithfulnesse and obedience of the subiects towards their Prince, and such vnitie and loue amongest ech other, that the countries by

God his prouidēce, haue florished with most happie prosperitie, the Princes then adorned with all honour and high dignities, and greatly redoubted and feared of their enemies.
            And because it néedes not to rehearse any thing out of the old histories, being notwith standing explenished with many presidēts, it hath appeared in all the warres of the Emperiall Maistie, what earnest care hée had to the defence and mayntenaunce of his countries in rest and quietnes.
            Likewise your Maiestie can well remember that he taking his leaue of these countries, did specially and earnestly recōmend the state therof vnto your Maiestie: Yea your Maiestie being at his arriuall burdened with gréeuous warres and extréeme charges, hath by experience found that all your subiectes both great and small, euerie one to his state and abilitie, haue bene readie to venture both life and goods in seruice of your Maiestie. Wherin aswel the Lords and nobles, as commons, haue so acquited and behaued themselues, that your Maiesty hath vanquished & ouercome your enemies, gotten great praise & renowne of al kings, and potentates, and made a fynall end of al warres and discentions, wherewith many

yeares before your auncetors and coūtries were troubled.
            Now if it might please your Maiestie, (which your lamentable and faithfull subiects do most humbly require) to enquire of and consider the originall occasions of the alterations of such good & quiet prosperitie, into such miserable commotions and extremities, wherwith the countries are now suppressed: your Maiestie shall find them to spring out of the malice and enuie which some (being about your Maiestie) do beare to the prosperitie and welfare wherewith God almightie hath blessed your countries and subiectes.
            Which enuie and cancred malice, being further incensed and stuffed with vnsatiable auarice and vnmeasurable prodigalitie, hath brought them to such crueltie and tiranny, that they altogether forgetting all affection and seruice which they did owe vnto the countrie wherin they haue gotten great honour & benefites, haue (to the great preiudice of the seruice of your Maiestie and common wealth of these countries) procured by all meanes and practises this most haynous fyre of commotion, to thintent to aspire to the dignitie surpassing the states of the land, yea of your Maiestie.
            And knowing well that to compasse that

deuise, it was a matter impossible, the customes and liberties of the countries remayning in force, which do altogether contrary their wicked pretence: considering besides, how diligent and faithful they of ye said countries were euery one in his vocation (according to their othe) to stand to the maintenance of the same: they attempted in peruerse maner too interprete too your Maiestie the doings and procéedings of the Lordes, gouernours, and states of the land, tending to the maintenance of ye said rights, and liberties, in such sort as if they tended to disobedience or rebellion towardes your Maiestie.
            Amongest which, specially some being spirituall persons, haue by all meanes attempted and sought, vnder pretence and shadowe of religion to confederate with other foraine prelates, and so by secret attempts and practises, to bring the countrie in hatred of your Maiestie, to thintent that they with their confederates which are by oth allyed not with your Maiestie, but with straunge rulers and countries in Italie & els where, specially with the Pope of Roome, might here beare rule and gouernaunce, &c. and as possibilitie and commoditie serued, to enlarge and confirme the same.
            For when they first perceiued that in all

the countries here abouts, yea ouer all Christendome, their rude and manifest abuses, and errours, by reason of the negligēce and auarice of the priestes were discried, & specially when it began to gréeue the chiefe & notablest persōs, yt they which ought onely to meddle with instructing of the people, in the faith and feare of God, and to execute his seruice with all fidelitie, according to ye example of the Prophetes and Apostels, did in steade therof, not onely contrarie to God his commaundement, but also to the decrées of the former Popes, and to all ordinaunces of the old counsels, yea against all statutes and vsages of Princes and countries▪ take vppon them to deale in worldly and Ciuill pollicies: yea also in matters toutching warfare and rule of countries, séeking to suppresse all degrées, and to reserue ye generall gouernement to themselues, taking in hand to bring all estates in disdaine and hatred of the Princes, aswell the subiects of your Maiestie, as of diuers other kinges, & Potentates, accusing them slaunderously with sedition and rebellion: whereby they haue stirred and prouoked, in all countries, troubles, and discention, warres and bloudshed, setting ye subiects at discord with their rulers, and the rulers against the subiects, & generally turned all things vpside down,

and brought in execrable confusion and errour, not estéeming who was endamaged, so as they might atchiue the accomplishmēt of their rule and dominion, and bring all thinges vnder their rule and aucthoritie.
            And to that intent, haue they sought, to plant in this countrie the inquisition, deuised and inuented in Spaine by certaine Jewes, and Renegados, by that meanes to breake all priuileges, rightes, and auncient customes, and to make frustrate all sworen contracts, vsages, and counselles, and so to get a full power and dominion ouer all your Maiesties faithfull seruants, which stand to the oth which they haue made to your Maiestie, not acknowledging any foraine Lords, spirituall or temporall, which might séeke by false accusations to impute vnto your subiectes, heresie and rebellion, to the intent therby to attayne to their purpose,
            For better accomplishing wherof haue they by force vrged and brought in the new Bishops, contrary to all landrights, and sworne priuileges, to the emparing of your Maiesties aucthoritie: chusing them not for vertue, prudence, or learning (being most of them, of the most rude and vnlearnest sort) but onely for that they take them as faithfull and true assistents, in the executing of their tiranny and crueltie.
            
               Their sayd vngodly enterprises and consequences of the same being the longer the more espied, haue the most notablest Lords, Gouernours, and Gentlemen, with the townes and countrie, giuen intelligence & knowledge to your Maiestie by continuall supplications, remonstrances and other possible meanes, how much the aucthorite of your Maiestie should be empared, shortned and deminished, by the said Inquisitors and Bishoppes, being most of them straungers and outlanders, by othe bound vnto foraine Princes, and (as they pretend) exempt of your iurisdiction, and by the same haue alleaged the euident impossibilite to bring in such inuocations, and newelties, but that it would tend to the vtter ruine & destruction of the whole countrie: seing that it was most apparant that the bringing in therof was but a borowed cloake to shadow their doings, in abusing of your Maiestie, & suppressing of such as would controle their wicked and most notorious procedings and abuses, which they themselues can scarce conceale. Of which the number in these coū
               tries is so great and manifold, and dayly doth more encrease: that if your Maiestie would haue ben ruled by their persuasiōs & counsell in executing of rigour and extremities, they would haue made your Maiestie

a kyng without subiects, and your subiects without rulers, as is most notorious by the innumerable number of those, which in these countries haue vnder pretence of religion bene executed and murthered aswell wt fyre, & water, as with ye sword: besides an infinite multitude which are fled out of the countrie bearing with them all occupatiōs & notable sciences to ye instructing of others, & vnspeakeable preiudice of your Maiestie and countries.
            Whereupon your Maiestie was in the end occasioned to a myld moderation of the placardes, by the same declaring that your meaning was not to bring in the Inquisition: which likewise was by the Duchesse of Parma, and the Lords and Gouernours of the countrie in the behalf of your Maiestie, solemply promised to all the Townes and subiects, and accordingly published by open proclamations, by commaundement of the Maiestrates. But shortly after, al that was ouerturned by meanes of the aforesaid persons, who in déed séeme to haue firmely persuaded your Maiestie, that suche was to the deminishing of your Maiesties reputation and dignitie, vniustly alleadging, that your subiects would withdraw themselues from the duetifull obedience of your Maiestie. So that it is euident that your Maiestie vpon

their informations, was moued to send the Duke of Alba out of Spaine into these Countries, to the intent with armes and force to compell your Maiesties subiectes, to that which they of themselues haue with all humilitie and obedience at all times offred.
            And notwithstanding that the aforesayd Lordes and Townes of these countries had good occasion to thinke that they should bée greatly wronged through force of forayne souldiours, and rule of a straunge Gouernour, not being of their Countrie, nor of your Maiesties kinred or descent, but such a one as did beare towards them a most cancred hatred, had meanes sufficiēt to preuent his comming into the countrie: yet because hée came in the name of your Maiestie, and to make euident that they had not rebelled or declined from the obedience of your Maiestie, trusting to their conscience and right, haue willingly and honorably receiued him with all such as it pleased your Maiestie to sende with him, opening to him the gates of the Townes, deliuered into his hands the fortresses and strong holdes, and entertayned garrisons, onely for yt hée declared, that such was the will and pleasure of your Maiestie to be thereby assured of the fidelitie & obedience of your subiectes, which were accused to your Maiestie as rebels and traytours.

Therfore, reason would haue required, that the aforesaid Duke of Alba should by all meanes and diligence haue informed your Maiestie of such your subiects true obedience and inclination: and before hée had procéeded to the execution of rigour, taken good and full information of their cōplaints, and chiefly touching the bringing in of these new Bishops and Inquisitors, contrarying God and all rightes, and that vpon good and true report thereof made to your Maiestie, redresse and remedie might haue ben had. But now cleane contrarie wyse, so soone as hée was receyued and was in possession of the force and rule of the Coūtrie, hath without kéeping of any order of Iustice, or hauing regard to the landrightes and priuileges whereunto your Maiestie is sworne: not onely put to death and chased away the most part of the Lordes and Gouernours of these countreis, by your Maiestie elected & placed, but also generally declared all the priuileges and liberties to be forfaited, and the Countrie to be vsed as a country newly conquested by force of armes, to the vse of him and his associates, and so consequently freely to deale with the lyues and goods of your subiectes, as their lustes and appetites shall require.
            And if possibly might be layd before your

Maiesties eyes the excessiue force and not beard of cruelties which here haue ben vsed since the beginning of his gouernement, by spoyling, robbing, chasing away, and desolating: by apprehending, taking, banishmēt, and confiscating of goods, yea by burning, hanging, headding, hacking, racking, & most horrible and not before heard of tormentes and murtherings of the Subiects of your Maiestie, aswell Noble as innoble, poore as riche, yong as olde, widowes and orphanes, men, women, and yong maidens, of what state, qualitie, or cōdition soeuer they were: we doubt not but that your Maiestie would be amased to heare the rehearsall thereof: yea and would be gréeued at the same, that vnder your name such vnnaturall crueltie and tyranny should be vsed▪ as neither Phalaris, Nero, Pharao, Herode, or any other Heathen Tyrant could haue inuented the lyke, as now is vsed towards your faythfull subiects, which with their liues and goods haue alwayes laboured to kéepe the Crowne on your Maiesties head, agaynst all your enemies.
            And that your Maiestie would also haue taken remorse of so many innocent infants chased awaye out of their natiue Countrie into straung lands: so many poore widowes and orphanes, and also vpon the lamētable

crye of the whole Countrie which now are suppressed by this most horrible tyrant.
            For there is none which could defend or preserue his goods from their auarice, their wyues or daughters frō their filthy lustes, or their lyues from their bloudthirstinisse. Nobilitie, Richesse, manhood, or good seruice done in tymes past, could nothing preuaile, if once hée was entred intoo hatred of them. And without taking regard to the Iurisdictions or ordinary courses of the countrie, hath stopped the Iurisdictions of al Iustices, either in ciuill or criminall causes which in any wyse concerne the confiscations pronounced in his bloudy Counsell, in such sorte as neyther spirituall or temporal persones, widowes or orphanes, hospitalls, Spittels, Lazarus houses, or other whiche had good and deuable reuenues, amongst ye confiscated goods, could get any payment or satisfaction. But the Duke of Alba hath gotten all into his hands without any mind to discharge any the premisses, notwithstā
               ding the diuers and earnest solicitations & requestes to him made in that behalfe by the States of the Countries, delaying the poore agréeued subiectes with dilatorie and vnfounded apostillations, the one alwayes contrarying the other, and without sending ouer the matters to the prouinciall Counsels

or ordinary Iustices, to the intent to make them dispaire of any satisfactiō to be made by the court, where by proces they haue ben sōmoned to their excissiue charge, and vpon summes of small value haue bene forced to greater charges then the principal hath amounted vnto, not suffering any law full transport to be made of any one debte for the other. To consider what number of honest woomen and yonge maydens they haue with force and violence rauished & that the one after the other: yea misused some euen to the death. Howe often haue they compelled the husbande to remaine wt the wife, and the father with the daughter, to force thē with their eyes to beholde their most vilanous filthinesse, and made them as instruments to the accomplishinge of their luxurious luste, vsing such vnnaturall and beastly fashions, that wée are in a manner abashed and astonied to declare the same to your Maiestie. Howe often hath it happened, that the husband séeking to defend hys wyfe or daughter of their rauishement, that they haue all togither as furious curres, run out of the house togither crying Spania, Spania, murtheringe a number of the poore commons. How many women great with childe haue they ript vp the bellies off, and murthered the frute in their wombes.
            
               Haue they not fleyed and pulled off ye skinns of some men being aliue and headdid their drommes with the same skin? others haue they not tosted with small fyres, nypped thē with red burning tonges euen to the death, and consequently murthered a number and made them dye a hundreth deathes? Howe many women haue they chased from their husbands, and children from their parents: yea what is there vnder the heauens so honest or holy which they haue not defiled and troden vnder foote? Uerily amongest all other Nations, yea amongest the cruelest, ye buryinge of the dead, hath alwayes bene permitted and reuerenced.
            But this Tirant in the despyte of God and nature, is so obstinate and peruerse, that hée hath caused to be taken out of the graue the carcasses of the dead, and conueyed vnder ye gallowes, vnder pretence because some of them dying without shrifte, & others without houseling had forfaited his goods which hée tooke as confiscated. What is there amongst men more holy and honest, then is the state of Matrimonie being the only and true foundation of all mutual loue & friendship, the originall of loue, the bond of peace, and the direct way of all dealings amongst men: whereof this Tyrant maketh so little accompte, that hée seuereth the mē frō their

wyues, and the wyues frō their husbands, being ioyned togither in the congregation before God and his Angels, cleane contrary to the commaundement and institution of almighty God and rightes, & all vnder pretence that they were ioyned togither in the way of heresie: but to saye trueth, it is onely in spoyling manner, to match the beautifull and riche Matrones with his Souldiours & ruffians, and finally by his crueltie burst in sunder the original bande tending to the intertayning of all mutuall loue: murthering and killing the women which in time of extremitie had reléeued their husbands, & the childrē for succouring the necessitie of their parents, yea those which had onely with a letter cōforted any of them. And to the ende that nothing shuld by him be left vndefiled, hath hée troden in most despitefull manner vnder foote the most holy Sacramēt of Baptisme, whereby wée are incorporated in the body of Iesus Christ and cōmunion of God his Church, willing and commaunding that those children which were Christened openly and lawfully according to the institution of Iesus Christ, in the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoste, should once agayn be baptised, vnder pretence that they were Christened as heretiques, and repugnant contrarie to all godly and naturall rightes,

ordonances of the church, & decrées of Counsells.
            Furthermore it néedeth not to rehearse to your Maiestie, the gréeuous exactions inuented by him, one after an other, and with out measure doth vrge of the poore commōs, as the hundrethes, twenties, yea the tenth penie, of all goods, mouables and immouables, of all goods bought and sold, demaunding, yea & vrging by execution contrarie to ye aduise & counsell of al estates in these coū
               tries, not of the cleare gaines of ye same, but the tenth, and twentie penie of the capitall some of all sales. Whereby not onely all trades and trafficques, are abandoned out of the land, but likewise the subiectes of the same, depriued from the getting of the liuing, of them, their wiues, and children. And notwithstanding that the states, haue at sundry times done their endeuour largely to infourme the said Duke of the inconueniences which might follow vppon the said demaund: and requested that he would in their behalfe aduertise your Maiestie therof: would not hearken to them, but shaked them of without any comefort: although he was by intercession of the counsel & states of the land therunto most earnestly instanced, and so therby caused the decay of all marchandise, compelled the inhabitants

through misery to flée away into other countries. And yet it is apparant, that when any necessitie is towardes for payment of the souldiers, no money is to be had, in such sorte that the Spanish souldiours are at afterdele in their payment xxviij. monethes, and the Dutche moste of them constrayned to go a begging from doore to doore: of which some haue by famine and misery perished. Notwithstanding the great sommes which the states haue leuied and paid to the paying of the said souldiours, & yet neuerthelesse haue his garnisons consumed, and eaten out the most part of the townes, & suppressed the same with the Seruitio, which they haue bene forced to minister to the said Spanish souldiours, and those which haue giuen most money, as well to him, as to Don Frederico, or any of theirs, haue bene the first that were discharged of the sayde bondage of Seruitio. With which garnisons he hath most vexed ye townes cituated within the hart of the countrie: leauing the borders and other places of importance without any garison, whereby in some places, thinges are come to alteration: besides that by reason of lacke of paye, his Spanish souldirurs are fallen into a most licentious and vnspeakable order of life, threatning, beating, robbing, spoyling, and by all maner of

cruell exactions vsing your subiects: wherby is manifest, that vnder pretence of your Maiesties name and religion, he setteth nothing but to fill his gréedie and bloudthirstie appetite, being to the contrarie most notorious that he hath so little regard to the seruice of our Maiestie, as to the maintenance of the common weale of the low countries, which he suffreth vtterly to perish and goe to ruine.
            But what néedeth it with wordes to expresse this, as if he had not sufficiently manifested whereunto his procéedings haue tended, shewing it being blinded with his most vnsatiable presumptiousnes & desire of vaine glory: as in a token of a Tropheum or signe of victory in his notorious procéedings, as before rehearsed, hath caused to be erected within the castell of Andwarpe, a brason Image standing vpon the nobilitie and states of the countrie. We leaue now vnrehearsed what his meaning was thereby, but when, or where, hath it bene séene that any Tirant in his life time hath caused any such Image to be erected. We find that the Romaine Emperours and Kynges, which in a maner had brought the whole world vnder their subiection, haue sometimes caused to be erected Images of brasse, and stone: as at this present the Popes of Roome who

pretend to be God his vicar, yet it is done by ordinaunce and consent of the counsell, & commons, or at the least by their aduise and suffrance: but that they in their life time haue done such, is not to be foūd by any exā
               ples or Cronicles, considering it to be a manifest token of madde arrogantie and insupportable pride: we find onely that Nabucho donozar who caused him self to be honoured as a God, set vp the like Image, commaunding all men to knéele and bowe vnto the same: yet durst he not do it but by consent of the chiefe and nobles of his countrie.
            But this Tirant doth aswell in his presumpteous arrogantie as in execrable tiranie surpasse al other tirants: who as though he would not onely aduaunce himselfe to the roome of the kyng, but likewise in God his place: hath without the aduise, counsell, or ordinance of any, in his life time erected this proud Image, to the defacing and emparing of your Maiesties dignitie, shewing therby his force and tyranny wherwith hée hath subdued and brought vnder foote these countries.
            And in like maner he hath not bene afraid following the example of the tirant Herode: to place himselfe vpon the market place of Andwarpe in your Maiesties stoole & cloth of estate: which neuer had ben touched by any

Liuetenant before, sitting there representing the absence of your Maiestie, as an Idoll, and vnder pretence of publishing of a pardon: which neuer Quéene, Duke, or any Gouernours or Gouernaunts of these countries haue done the like: tending to the manifest disestimation and abasing of your Maiesties honour and dignitie.
            These procéedings, most soueraigne king are become so apparant and euident vnto al the world, that all straunge nations, and Potentates, haue a terrour and execration therat▪ insomuch as euen the Duke of Alba his souldiours, and seruants, do protest and say, that they can not esteeme such for good, much lesse that the seruice of your Maiestie, and welfare of the countrie, should therin consist.
            Besides that we can not thinke that your Maiestie being therof sufficiently and truely infourmed, would permit such forces and violences, for it was neuer heard that any King or Potentate, hath so vnmercifully dealt with his subiects: your Maiesties auncetours of most famous memorie, haue in most milde and gentle maner behaued thē
               selues towardes their subiectes, that they haue therof giuen a most laudable example not onely to their successours, but also to other Christian Princes, Dukes, & rulers,

that whensoeuer any discention was risen betwéene the subiects and Magestrates, by reason of misgouernement, & taken armes in hand: and being againe brought vnder obedience by their Lordes and rulers, were neuer molested with these examples of crueltie, but by expresse capitulation frō word, to word, confirmed all their priuileges and liberties, and the same to enioye their full effect.
            So as wée shoulde greatly wrong your Maiestie, if we should persuade our selues that your Maiestie were so farre diuerted from the example of your predecessours, & from the duetie of all other Christian Princes and Potentates, that in steade of ministring right and Iustice to your obedient subiects, and giuing audience to their most pitifull complaints, shuld send such a tirant in such sort cruelly to murther thē, destroying the countrie, and burthening your subiects with most intollerable slauery, seruitude, and thraldome.
            And now the sayd Duke presenting vnto vs his fained pardons, vnder the name of your Maiestie for our rebellions and misdemeanours (as he termeth them) we coulde not accept the same without depriuing of your Maiesties dignitie.
            Knowing well that your Maiestie will

not, before hauing heard the iustnesse of our cause condemne vs of rebellion. Where is there any that iustly hath infourmed your Maiestie of our dealings, or when did euer your Maiestie giue eare vnto any, but such as were our manifest enemies? Reason requireth both partes to be heard, before sentence should be pronounced. And therfore in the Cronicles of Alexander the great, is much cōmended: who whensoeuer he heard any parties, leaned with his head vpon his shoulders with one of his eares closed, and being asked why he so did, aunswered that the later partie ought aswell haue audience as the first, which order hath alwayes bene had in estimation of all nations, as being conformable to all naturall rightes. So as no offendour, what gréeuous crimes so euer he had committed shalbe iudged or condemned, but that he shall first aunswere vnto such accusations as are alleged against him.
            Now most mercifull & soueraigne Lord and King, we doe most hūbly prostrate our selues vnder the foot of your Maiestie, most hartely requesting the same, that it woulde please your Grace to bend towards vs one eare, and (as in a ballance) equally to weye our estates. Your Maiestie hath by postes, letters, and other meanes ben informed of

this present estate, and our mouthes haue ben closed vp, our tongues pearsed with red burning Irons, and our lippes seared vp with burning tonges, because we shuld not giue our necessitie to vnderstād. The waies haue as yet ben taken from vs, so that our lamentable cryes could neuer come vnto, or pearse the eares of your Maiestie.
            How then can your Maiestie condempne vs of rebellion (which always we haue had in hatred) because that the Duke of Alba doth séeke to bring vs vnder his subiection with his letters of pardon, and wée nothing estéeming of the same: which he perceyuing and that with force hée cannot (by God hys prouidence) preuayle, we cannot therfore accept his said letters as being directed to vs who neuer strayed from your obedience, except it were that we would take & acknowledge the Duke of Alba for our King: for him onely haue we resisted & not your Maiestie, whom we with life and goods (so long as it shall please God to permit vs ye same) will faithfully serue and obeye. And therefore his pardō doth nothing touch vs, which tendeth onely to the Townes which haue ben seduced from the Kings obedience. But we marke his intent, knowing that eyther hee would be king himselfe, or else that wée by entisemēt of his subtile pardons shoulde

condempne our selues. For wée receyuing pardon, must acknowledge our selues gilty of commotions and rebellion agaynst oure King, of tumult and sedition, yea of heresie and declyning from the Christian faith, and in fyne, to the depriuinge of the honour of God and the Kings maiestie. This is hys seeking, that by receyuing of his false & fayned pardōs, we shuld by our subsignations & seales confirme the same, to the intent that hée hereafter might thereby defende and excuse himselfe of tyranny before your Maiestie and all other christian Princes and Potentates, saying, that if we had not founde ourselues culpable in these gréeuous offences for which we were punished and tormē
               ted, we would neuer haue receyued any remisse or pardon.
            Wherein wée take God, the searcher and knower of all hartes, and your Maiestie to witnesse, that if wée haue committed any such offences, as by the sayd pardon are layd to our charge, that wée doe altogither refuse all pardon, but desire as the moste wickedst and vylest creatures on earth, to make satisfaction for our offences with our bloud, and doe not refuse, O most mercifull King, one after an other, to suffer most extreeme torments, if it may be found that wee haue offended in such order as is presumed.
            
               And do request the Duke of Alba, (if any petition will take place with him) that all such as come to him for pardon, acknowledging the pretended offence, that hée without shewing of mercy, doe entreat them in such sorte as their offences (according to righte) haue deserued, commending him therein in gyuing or mayntayning any fayth or credit with him as one so vnfaithfull to God & his King, as hath not ben abashed so greatly too abuse and contempne their Maiesties.
            But what is it, it shall not be found that euer we haue thoght any such matter, much lesse in effect shewed the same. We haue alwayes bene faithfull and seruiseable to our King, and sought to serue God, the father of our Lord Iesus Christ in spirit and truth, according to his word and commaundment, so farre as our féeble nature would permit, euen to the last droppe of our bloud.
            But considering that the Duke of Alba in stead of executing equitie and Iustice, and hearing of their complaintes and gréefes, & persecutinge of your maiesties promises, hath contrary to all right and reason, & our rightes and priuileges, suppressed vs wyth most cruell tyrannie, destroyed oure Countries, and vsed vs more seuerely, then euer Jewes or Turkes haue done against their vanquished enemies. And in the meane space,

hath hée accused vs to your Maiestie, and al other christian Potentates with false accusations of rebellion and heresie: and we neuer could come to our aunswer, or receyue any comfort in the vniuersall world. So as by necessitie we haue ben forced to take the armes in hande, and by all meanes possible sought to defende our poore natiue Country from such execrable tyrannie: and rather wc one accord to spende our lyues, then to fall into the handes of such a Tyrant: wherein wée meane to persiste, except that it please your Maiestie with mercyfull cares to attende to our complaintes, and minister to vs Iustice against such oppression and tyrā
               ny. For God be thanked, we are not so il instructed in his word, but that we know very well, that aswell our lyfe as death consisteth in his handes, & that this death which no man can escape, is but as a ready path too the lyfe euerlasting.
            Therefore, séeing our death maye bée a pleasure to other, wee chuse rather to dye an honorable death in the behalfe of the liberties and common weale of our Country, thē to fall into such seruitude, and become footestooles vnto most arrogant aliants, who alwayes haue hated vs. For at the least wée shall thereby leaue to our successors suche a good fame, as it may be sayd, that their Predecessours

had rather with renowne to dye with honour, then lyue in all bondage and shame.
            Wée contende for the libertie of our consciences, in defence of our wyues and children, our bloude and goods, that is to saye, whether the Duke of Alba with his complices shall according to his selfe will bée a Lord and Gouernour, or that wée to the behoofe of your Maiestie, O most Souerayne King, shall defende it from him. We know that the limites of our liues are set, and shal not by the pardon of the Duke of Alba surpasse the same. Therefore wée onely desire your Maiestie, that it may please the same to weye and consider our cases, and not to suffer, that wee by accepting such pardones, should for euer be reputed as rebels to God and our King, which we neuer thought.
            For wée are fully perswaded, yt although wee had receyued those pardons, yet would it nothing haue preuayled for safegarde of our lyues, for thereby the Duke of Alba might haue had the better action against vs the proceeded with most seueritye, & might had better haue answered for himselfe, if we and confessed our selues gilty of rebellion, both against God & the King his Maiestie. For then no mā would haue moned vs, although we had bene slayne and murthered

as disturbers of the peace and common wealth and not worthy to lyue.
            And although it were not so, yet it is apparant by all the Duke of Alba his proceedinges, that he meaneth to obserue no faith with vs, for seeing that he hath openly perpetrated the othe which the Duches of Parma, with all the Lordes and gouernours of the countrie, in the name of your Maiestie, had sworne so solemply to these townes: yet hath he in these latter warres, sufficiently expressed his peruerse meaning in diuers townes, as at Mons in Henauld hath he cō
               trary to his othe, caused a number of Burgeses to be hanged, at Naerdon he hath executed his crueltie in such a sort as in a town of like bignes hath not ben hard of: and now at Harlem hath he or at ye least in his name, Don Frederico assured the souldiours of their liues, & therunto certaine Lords as pledges they bound themselues: and yet hath he euē to the young paiges, caused them to be murthered one with another, and their naked carcasses to the scandale of all women, and virgins, left lying vpon the scaffold a day & a night. And such as had consented to the deliuery of the towne, and were entred into his seruice, hath he caused to be caried to the Galies, and vpon the Fuycke before Harlem when he had promised the souldiours

their liues, suffred them to perish with hunger, saying: that he had assured them of their liues, and not of meate and drinke. As also the Burgeses of Harlem, whom he had assured their liues, hath he compelled to be Myners before the towne of Alkmar, where they are by the inhabitants slayne: which doth passe all barbarous tiranny and crueltie, and is a most manifest token wherwith he séeketh to maintaine his vntrue procéedinges.
            So that it is euident that he meaneth not to obserue any othes or promises, but for a small time: to the entent he might the better haue his will of others, and because hée might the better hereafter defend his case, against your Maiestie, and other Princes, doth produce this pardon, for if we do accept the same we must néedes acknowledge our selues giltie of such offences, as he layeth to our charge▪ and is not bound to the obseruing of any othe: for by the counsell holden at Constance, it was aboue ij. hunderd yeres enacted that no faith is to be kept with heretiques.
            For wheras he doth in his pardon subtilly alleadge that such offēces as haue bene committed, were done more vpon euill suggestin, and euill will, then of their owne nature and enclination. This is but a subtill

pollicie, wherwith he ment to disceaue the simple, and bring them vnder his yoke: and to furnish himselfe of power to suppresse all such as he thinketh good, and that without reproch of any, séeing that it standeth in his iudgement who hath offended, the premisses or not.
            But once consider most soueraigne King, how that the righteous GOD hath deceaued this subtile dealer in his procedings, for in this pardon wherin he pretendeth most gréeuously to accuse vs, he doth by expresse wordes confesse, that he can by no meanes thinke that we could not haue bene so altered or chaunged, but vppon euill suggestion or els we shuld haue continewed in al faith and willingnesse, which we alwayes haue shewed to your Maiestie.
            For if it be so, that we before this last offence (as he termeth it) haue shewed to your Maiestie all obedience as he himselfe witnesseth? Why hath he then vsed such crueltie and persecution? Wherefore hath hée in such sorte distroyed the townes, burned the the villages, and places: murthered the inhabitants, and spoyled thē of all their goods, hath not he by his souldiours by fyre consumed Catwicke vpon Zea, Sandwicke and Alfen, & that long before these transgressions, wherof he complayneth, were begone. Did

not they pretend to set fyre on the towne of Vtrecht, which was so well addicted vnto them, haue not they in Rotterdam, where as they were receaued as fréends, cruelly murthered a number of Burgeses, was not foūd by Pacheco a bill of innumerable number, aswell of the nobilitie, as most substantiall commons in sundrie and diuers townes, which by commaundement of the Duke should haue bene murthered, if matters by Gods prouision had not altered. And wherunto tended the demaund of the tenth penie, to none other end but that we should at his handes buy our goods, which he pretended to be confiscated: whereby it appeareth that he and his adherents are sworne enemies vnto your Maiestie: whilest he doth in such sort execute his tiranny, murther, burning, and with such force and seruitude, doth agréeue vs your subiects, whom he himselfe doth alleage to haue bene most faithfull vnto your maiestie. So as through necessitie we haue ben compelled to enter into armes to resist his force and tiranny: which his seruants could not denie, who diuers times haue sayd that they would so long vexe and trouble this countrie and inhabitants therof, that in the end they should be forced to rebell, and so haue occasion to bring it vnder subiection, & spoyle the same of all their

substance: which is to be approued by some letters, wherby was written, that this it was for which they longed. It is very trew most soueraigne King, that the Duke doth heare alleage, as that your subiects would neuer had rebelled, but vpon suggestion of certaine euill disposed, which euill disposed are none other then the Duke himself, with his bloudy counsel, and sanguine adherents, which of meare set, euill will, and vnsatiable auarice, haue sucked the sweate & bloud of your subiects, & of long time so earnestly persecuted, and gréeued to the vttermost, that they for defence of themselues, their wiues, children, and all that which in this world they do estéeme of, haue bene forced to take armes in hand: Therfore where as he presumeth that he hath so louingly dealt with other townes, take example by Tourn
                     •
                  y, Valencien, Lysle, Jpre, Maestricht, Deuenter, and likewise by Machlin, Oudenard, Dermonde, and Naerden, where they haue by murthering, robbing, hanging, rauishing of women, and with diuers outrages persecuted the poore commons.
            Besides this hath there bene murthered at Bruxels at sundry times aboue CC. and xxx. Burgeses, and that long before the beginning of these warres, as also in a commotion at Gaunt, which happened amongst

the Spaniards, where of the commons haue bene slaine LX. or LXX. besides an infinite number of men and women▪ which at sundrie times haue bene murthered, which we leaue to enlarge here séeing those their procéedinges are accompted mercifull dealings besides other most wicked insolences vsed in the said townes.
            And therefore hée néedeth not to threaten vs, that if wée do not accept his pardon, that no rigour which may be deuised, shalbe left vnexercised towardes our persones, by desolation, honger and sword, in such sorte, as no remembrāce shalbe left of them present. For wée are certaine, that here about hée hath sought as much as is to him possible: and would vndoubtedly haue vsed further crueltie (whereof hée boasteth so much) if the feare which hée hath, that the Coūtries would not any longer abyde his crueltie, had not letted him.
            Hée doth not so much estéeme the seruice of your Maiestie, nor regardeth your heritage & countries, as that hée would abstayn from ruining and destroying the same: yea vtterlye to roote out the reliques and memories thereof, so farre as it were to him possible, as the burning & desolating which hée before these warres, hath vsed, doe sufficiently beare witnesse. But wée truste that

the almighty God will neuer suffer y• your Maiestie should permit your Countries altogither to fall into the force of suche a Tyrant and destroyer.
            For, whereas hée here alleadgeth that we haue put on armes agaynst your Maiestie: that wée vtterly denie. For wée proteste before your Maiestie, yea before God & hys Angells, that our meaning or pretēce was neuer such. For wée wil aduētur our selues and all that wée haue in this world, as likewyse we haue don towards your Maiesties predecessours, with lyfe and goods to stande to ye defēce of your maiestie against al your enemies and ill willers.
            But this wée will acknowledge before the vniuersall world, that (being thereunto extremely constrayned) wée haue taken armes in hand agaynst the tyranny and abuses of the Duke of Alba and his cōplices, to deliuer our lyues and goods, wyues and children from the bloudthirstie hands of his ministers: and if hée doo preuayle agaynste vs, rather chuse to dye an honorable death, and leaue a fame to our successours, then to yéelde and bowe to such a tyrant, and suffer our countrie to liue vnder vnsupportable slauerie. So else we should be abashed and ashamed too shewe our faces in any other Countries, as hauing neglected the seruice

of your Maiestie. And therefore haue all the Townes ioinctly and seuerally taken in hande and sworne the one after the other, to abyde al sieges, if néed bée, to the vttermost, though to the losse of their lyues and goods: yea rather set fyre of our owne howses, thē to yéeld to the force of this Tyrant.
            For wée are well assured, that at the hāds of such a Tyrant, as regardeth no othe, and hath so often and cruelly threatned vs, there is no more to be looked for, but that he wold rather colour the riuers and streames with our blood, and to behange the countrie with our bodyes, to satiate his bloudthirsty luste and appetite.
            Therfore we prostrate our selues before the féete of your Maiestie, desiring the same for GOD his sake, who hath set ye Crowne vppon your head, and gyuen the Scepter into your hande once to bowe your eares to our reasonable complayntes. Wée doe not desire to be dissolued from the obediēce of your Maiestie, but onely that we may haue our consciences frée to Godwarde, to heare his holy worde, & to follow the same, to the intent to giue an accompt at the daye of Iudgement of our soules, & that we may atcheue such discharge for our miserable natiue Countrie, which alwayes hath donne such faythful seruice to your Maiestie, from

the yoke and bondage of forayne Nations and Spanish Souldioures, and to suffer the Countrie to enioye those liberties, priuileges and customes, as your Maiestie, and the most puissant Emperour Charles, your Maiesties most noble father (of famous memorie) haue to youre Subiectes solemply sworne.
            Then will wée at the commaundement of your Maiestie lay downe our weapons & armes, and will venture body, goods, and all that wee haue in the world, in the seruice of your maiestie by water or by land, where & whensoeuer your Maiestie shall commaund the same: and your Maiestie shall finde that wée are not altered or abastarded from you, but rarher that wée doe excell in faythefull seruice, all our predecessours, which hereby wée do promise and sweare to your maistie, beséeching euē as wée doo faithfully meane it, so to take mercie of our soules.
            Desiring that this our declaration and othe be openly published and declared to all Kings, Potentates, Lordes and Nations, to the intent they may knowe that we are no Rebelles towards our King, for wée neuer learned such of our predecessours: But that wée of méere force and necessitie haue bene constrayned to take on armes agaynst the enemies & vsurpers of his maiesties name.
            
               Requesting therfore all christen Princes and Potentates, yt they wilbe moued with a pytyfull compassion of our miseries, (and much doubting that this our supplication & declaration shalbe kept back and suppressed as other our former Requestes haue bene, & not come to our Kings handes:) that they will thereof informe his Maiestie, to the intent our iust cause maye come to light, and that his Maiestie may be acquited of the innocent bloud which this Albanish Tyrant doth shedde. This wée hartely desire, and wée all will pray vnto almighty GOD, for their prosperitie to remain for euer.
            FINIS.
