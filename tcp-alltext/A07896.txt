            ¶The Argument.
            
               
                  PAlunor, a
Scholler longe
time in Scienna,
no lesse seene in
Science, then in
secreates of Nature,
commeth to Padua, and hauing
by Fortune, found to his
content, a place meete for his purpose,
not onely applyant to his s
                  •
               
               rious
studies, but also prospectiue
in eache kinde of pleasure: he endeuoreth
himselfe to his wunted
exercise, in so muche that he was
renowned for a Poet, but how? not
as our Poets, that prefer the praise
of women: but hee onely was a

Poët more to contemne looue,
then by any way to commend it.
And therefore he was of women
vtterly abandoned, insomuch that
the women gaue him this name,
Poeta Puella, a Maidenlie Poët.
And beeing one day walking for
his delight, in a pleasaunt plotte
not far frō his lodging he was descried
by a Lady named Caliphia;
who of long time had heard of his
contempte, and wrong oppinion
in looue. And beeing desirous
to vse some conference with him,

                  〈◊〉
                that bothe time and place fitted
so well, she addresseth her selfe no
lefse to salute him: then hee seeing
her pretence, prepared to counteruaile
such courtesie, which beeing
by bothe performed; shee with a
sweete and sober voice, began to
say. Sir, if my sudden approche
might bee no preiudice to your

learned practises, or otherwise my
demaund not vnto you disdainefull:
I then would craue your
doome concerning a doubt which
yet resteth
                  •
                vnresolued, and the
case not so curious as I am perswaded
to haue solution by your
skill. The Scholler heerat somewhat
abashed, more to see her person
in his presence, whom hee
knew to be the prize of Padua,
then for anye dispaire he had in
disclosing her demaund: with
courteous and colde communication
reaunswered to bee at her
commaund; reuerently beseeching
her▪ not to conceale anye cause
which shee deemed his learning
could define. Which courtesie
she so well accepted, that turning
to such as were in her company:
shee willed them to walke aside,
till shee by signe, gaue showe to

haue them come. And beeing
bashfull, began so sweetely for to
blushe: that the blood brought
to her beautie a farre better
fauour then
before.
And thus her tale
beginneth.
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶A Delicate Discourse
betwixt a Lady, and a
Scholler of Scienna.
            
               Ladie.
               
                  
                     I Haue desired
of long time, to haue
heard your oppinion,
but sure my hope neuer
hapt so well as my
wyll did wishe, tyll now at this instant,
when least I lookte, it is my
chaunce to gaine my desire. And
therefore not refusing opportunity so
well offered, nor your courtesie proffered,
know you Sir in bréefe, my demaunde
is this. Whether Learning
may liue without Looue, or Looue
liue without Learning: Loe this is
all, it is no difficult demaunde, and
yet sure it is doubtfull to me, therefore
I beséeche your opinion heerin.
            
            
               
               Scholler.
               Madame, as your reason dooth
craue no rashe reply, so are the causes
to be scande according to their
vertue, the c
                     •
                  mmodity of the one
contemnes the discommodity of the
other: and sure▪ they bothe are not to
be spared, yet may the one be vtterly
reiected, and that is Looue. For touching
the nature of ye same, although
by a naturall instincte, men haue rather
giuen themselues thereto then
otherwise: the thing of it selfe is but
a vaine desire, a pleasaunt flame or
furie kindled by affection, a bitter
sweete: or rather as I might terme it

                     ••
                  perefanion Cacone, a swéete euill

                     •
                  auste with a sower sappe: the commoditie
whereof cannot be so commended,
but the abuses thereof more
vtterly abhorred. For why? as the
thing it selfe ought to be preferred as
moste sacred and profounde, so the inexecrable
vices lincked there vnto,
and the mischéefes so many which
thereof ensueth: maketh the delight

more odious then honorable, so that
there is no comparisō, but that Learning
may better liue without Looue,
then Looue without Learning. For
as Looue is generally rather thought
a vice, more then a vertue: so Learning
from his originall is thought
the onely touche, that tryeth such vanities
to be rather detested then desired.
But now as touching Learning
and the swéete commoditie thereof▪ I
say that it is the Key of the Common
wealth, the onely Loadestone of mās
                     •
                  
life, the Nurse and Foster mother 
                     〈◊〉
                  
Science, the sure supporter and vpholder
of vertue: yea and the stronge
                     •
                  
and trustie Tower, that serues to
                     •
                  
garde & gouerne Princes. Sure, if I
should say so much of Learning, as if
libertie would permit I could be wel
contēt to discourse: my tongue should
not waxe so wearie, as your eares
woulde bee desirous to heare the
depthe of suche a tale. For to
Learning, is not onely the charge
of the Common wealth committed:

but also there dependeth therevpon
the deuine direction, and sauegarde
to mans soule. Without learning
there could be no Lawe, without
Lawe no L
                     •
                  ue, yea and without
Looue no life: So that Learning by
Lawe dooth rather maintayne Looue,
then Looue by Lawe maintaine learning.
Beside, I could tell of a number,
which by learning haue béene aduaunced
to honnor, whereas yet by
Looue I haue heard of very few. For
what was euer with the Romaines
so much in estimation as Learning?
allwayes the Senate was supplyed
with singuler Schollers, they regarded
not the value but the vertue: so
that Learning found there more liberty
then Looue.Heere was wunne wealth by wisdome. A simple Shéepeheards
sonne, by Learning hath prooued
a Praetor, yea or rather Dictator
of Roome. How many Clownes
haue béene brought to the like honnor
by Looue? if none, then Madame
you are to be loouing subiect to Learning,
to whom I giue the Soueraignetie.

And as for Looue, this I
pronounce, it is generally vice,
though a perticular vertue, and sure
a very méere vanitye; better to be
wanted then wished: for by authority,
aswell sacred as prophane, there is
lefte to vs a memorie of the manifolde
mischeifes, that thereby haue
chaunced. And therefore (Madame)
my aunswer is this, Learning excelleth
Looue, if to the contrarye you
thinke your selfe able to defend my
argument: you here haue libertye to
prooue at your pleasure.
            
            
               Ladie.
               I thanke you for it, but I perceaue
if I were so ignoraunt, that I could
not my selfe define on such a doubt: I
were much the better to referre my
want to your wisedome, for you argue,
but you will not allowe: either
you déeme me too simple to compare
with your skill, or my wit too weake
to counteruaile your wisedome. But
Sir, surmise you now dispute with a
Dame, and not a Docter: as I am

not altogether a Sophister, so thinke
me not so ignoraunt: but that I can
sounde the depthe of a greater doubte
then I haue yet demaunded. And
whereas you rather infer the praise
onely to Learning and not to Looue:
I wil prooue that Looue in a publique
weale, is to be allowed abooue Learuing,
and Learning more better to
be spared then Looue. Firste consider,
that Looue is no particuler propertie:
but that the same is generall
and common to all liuing creatures,
but of humanitie moste honoured.
Secondly consider the originall from
whence Looue taketh his beginning.
And lastely,Philosophie in a woman. scanne the sence according
to the simple meaning: and then
tell me how great a matter is included
in this little woord Looue. You
wil not deny, but by nature men are
learned to looue, and by Looue, Nature
had her beginning. How can it
then bee chosen, but Looue héerein
was Schoolemaister to Learning:
séeing the originall was Looue

by Nature? which brought foorth
Schollers though not traynde in
Schooles.
            
            
               Scholler.
               Not so, for as Looue at the firste
was rather Subiect vnto Nature,
then either Nature or Looue a subiect
vnto Learning: so time héerein
was to be preferred before either.Theology.
For time brought foorth Nature, and
Nature engendred Looue, of Looue
came Lawe, and of Lawe Learning.
So that I saye, learning had his orriginall
from the beginning, and
Looue by the diuine substaunce of the
Deity, gaue aide to Nature: which
after made Looue a Schoolemaister,
and Learning a Scholler. But how?
that men ought to looue Learning,
and not Learning to like of Looue.
For why? the discommodities thereof
are so daungerous: as that Patriarkes,
Prophets, Princes, yea
and the moste notable Philosophers,
doo vtterly estéeme it as an enemie
to all vertue.
               
                  How many Princes, and other of as
great power, haue (by prophane and
sacred authority) béen seduced by this
deceitefull Looue? I reade of Sallomon,
Dauid his Father,Genesis. yea Abraham
and Lot, whom though all these
were chosen Uessels of the Lorde, yet
could they not but doate vpon this
vaine desire. And therfore, these haue
left behinde them, a staffe to leade the
ignorant, least as they did, they féele
the scourges of Follie. And yet Abraham
forgot Gods promise, & doated
vpon Agar: Dauid earnestly repented,
and Salomon when he perceiued
he had sinned, asked mercy of the
Lorde. Therefore I must appropriate
to them, that looue: thus saying.
Dulce bellum in expertis, Warre is
swéete to those that neuer felt it. And
so Madam is Looue, but his sauor is
sower.
            
            
               Ladie.
               You haue made a longe protestation,
but I pray you tell me, if Looue
had not béene liked of such holy fathers:

whether had they hazarded
theyr soules or not, for so swéete a
sinne?
            
            
               Scholler.
               I déeme that although by Nature
they sinned, hauing a lust rather to
flesh then faythe: yet by repentaunce
theyr sinne was but small, and that
theyr sinnes left vs a sacred Testimony,
to eschew so vaine a delight as
Looue, which in the ende is repentaunce.
As sayd Demostenes, when he
at Corinthe desired Layes of Looue,Whereof arose th
                        •
                     s Prouerbe.

his person,Non lice
                        •

buie repentaunce so deare. Loe Lady,
how little was looue estéemed, allthough
Layes offered her selfe for a
summe, which was then the thirde
Thirioletta or Harlot of the worlde.
How thinke you heerin?
            
            
               Ladie.
               Marie very well, for as I remember,
the moste wisest, learnedst, yea
and moste Poets and Philosophers,
were made by Layes a laughing

stock, who heareing one day great
prayse spoken of the Philosophers
and Schoole of Athens: as one sodenly
breaking out in laughter, she replied
thus. Are these (quoth she) they
whom you reporte for their learning
                     Layes had more.
so much renowned:Schollers then euer had Socrates.
                   and come to Corinth
to learne of Layes? Now certainely
(quoth shée) I am the Philosopher,
and they are my Pupils or
Schollers: for all theyr studie could
neuer comprehend, what I in Corinth
haue giuen them to vnderstand.
How thinke you now to Layes?
was she not as skilfull in Learning
as in Looue?
            
            
               Scholler.
               In neither of bothe.
            
            
               Ladie.
               Why? she was beautifull.
            
            
               Scholler.
               Yea, but more bountefull: for shee
was better learned in luste then in
                     Layes was Daughter to one of the préests of Apollo.
                  
looue, or els she had béene the onely
Dame and delight of Pirrhus. But
she learned Looue, and all her delight

was to traine her Disciples with the
like. So, that her learning prooued
luste, her beauty a wrimpled brauerie,
and all her Doctrine none other
but destruction. If I should stande
vppon authoritie, I could recite a nū
                  ber
through her folly brought to miserie:
& sure at y• time when she liued,
there were other twaine, Lamia the
Concubine of Demetrius, and Flora
béeing an Italian, farre more of honor
then either Layes or Lamia. And
therefore (Madam) you cannot ascribe
any lawde vnto Layes: s
                     •
                  eing
that by luste, she was bothe enemie
to Looue, and foe vnto learning. For
there is neither Poet, Orator, nor
Philosopher: but vtterly abhorreth
Layes, with her adherents in all their
laboures.

                     〈◊〉
                   her, his Learning did loathe
her. And therefore I hope this example
may make you content not to
striue any further.
            
            
               Ladie.
               Nay Sir, you shall not so shake me
off, séeing you by common Courtizans
doe rather gaine glory, then by
loyall looue vsed of constant Ladyes:
I will now requite your example
with the like, although I might rather
blushe then to boaste thereof.
Yet séeing we stand vpon example
hetherto, onely vpon prayse and disprayse
of Looue: I purpose now to
wade a little farther, and either to
prooue Looue Soueraigne of Learning,
or Learning superior, and
looue his Subiect. I am sure you are
not ignoraunt of Flora, for that I
heard you name her of late, the life
of whom, though I wish not to commend:

so will I not condemne her
wisedome, in the subtill Schooling
and Nurtering of her Pupils or
Schollers.
               
                  FLora was of byrthe noble, of nature
gentle, of personage beautifull,
and of Looue liberall, in so
much that ouer the place where she
dwelt, she set vp this scrole or prescripte.
Except King Prince,
                  A large title. 
                  Dictator,
Praetor, Consull, Censor or Questor,
heere is no place for any to enter.
As for Emperor or Keyser, they
were not then knowne, this was her
vse, she neuer set her honour like
Layes to salery: for Laies would commonly
haue her hyer before hande.
Now Flora had this fetch, she as not
respecting Goulde or Siluer, gaue
her selfe to be gouerned by her Loouer.
And so by this meanes she got
treasure infinite, for why? this was
her common phrase, béeing one day
demaunded the cause by Noble men,
why she refused to aske what she
would haue, she aunswered thus.
               
                  
I cōmit my selfe (quoth she) to Princes
and Noble men, that according to
my beautye, I may be pertaker of
their bounty. For (quoth she) by the
Gods whom I doo serue, there was
neuer man gaue me so little, but that
I had more then I lookt for, or double
to my demaund. There ought
(quoth she) no sage woman to set her
selfe to sale, for all things in y• world
are rated at a price, except Looue, and
y• is not to be payed but with Looue:
so that none ought to demaund duety
for the amorous pleasure she dooth to
a man, but for the Looue she beareth
vnto him. This was ye opiniō of this
Courtezan, who though she were cō
                  mon,
it was not so much for coyne as
courtesie. She sought to none, yet
was she sought of all. The learnedst
thought no shame to be her Schollers.
Then Ergo Looue was héere
more regardant then Learning whē
Consuls & Censores left all for lust &
Looue of Flora. Whether was Wit
or Wisdome héere best Scholler?

Witte wan Looue and wealth, and
Wisdome loste wealth and gaynde
Luste.
            
            
               Scholler.
               Sure Madame, you scan the sence
contrary, for though Flora found such
fortune, as that the wisest and wealthiest
were bondmen vnto her beautie:
yet she neuer held Learning in
subiection. Learning still had liberty
to triumphe ouer Looue, although the
learned were snared by her subtilty.
So that if Looue haue conquered any,
blame the Booke bearer, and not
the Booke: for Learning it self neuer
yet hath nor will bende to beauty,
I stand vpon this oppinion.
            
            
               Ladie.
               Of trothe I beléeue you thinke your
selfe in your study, or els you would
not speake so obscure: but what figure
you take I know not, but wel I
note all your woords are per Allegoriam.
But Sir according to my Lodgicke,
I will approoue, that as long
as the Learned are liuing, they enioy

Learning, and the benefit thereof:
you cannot seperate them a sunder,
for conquere one and take bothe. Euen
as a man should say, take my
heart and take my life, naming two
when one would suffise. Therefore
Sir, I say that if Loone subdue the
Learned, shee then is conqueror of
bothe: vnlesse you will make a distinction,
touching the person of the
one, and the property of the other,
and that you cannot, for that they
bothe are so faste lincked as nothing
can sunder them: therefore you erre,
if to the contrarye you conster the
case.
            
            
               Scholler.
               Well, then I perceaue you will
haue it: either to what perfection you
please, or els you wyll not giue ouer.
And therefore as I remember,Cornelius Suetonius. 
                  Cornelius
Suetonius sheweth a notable
example, to the vtter abollishing of
Looue, which you tearme amorous
or pleasaūt pastimes: and for because
that you will not be perswaded, that

Looue can any way be reiected rightfully:
I will now by example prooue
it to be so odious, as you your selfe
shall confesse it hath varyed from the
lawes of Nature: and this is the example.
               THe Tirant Nero, who not onely
longe time moste
                     •
                   inordinately
and beastly, spoyled a number of
Uir
                     •
                  ins and chaste Ladyes:A moste horrible acte of Nero. bothe against God. and the Lawe of nature. but also
finding a beautifull Boye, more pleasaunt
in his eyes then any other
Uirgin or woman: caused his secrets
to be spoyled, thinking thereby to
haue him transformed to his owne
pleasure, by such a Metamorphosis as
of a man to haue a woman. Not long
after he married him, naming him
Sporus, endowing him with such secret
duties, as to a Wife are due by
dowry. Héere was lust more thē law
of Nature, and yet it was Looue. But
I hope you will not allow this, séeing
that Nature was héere a foe vnto
her selfe, in kindling so great a fire
in Nero, as could not be quenched

without such a cursed coniunction.
This Luste of Nero quite extinguished
the glory of Looue, and makes
the same so odious to the eares of
such as reade this tragedy: that men
rather séeke by reason to brydle such
fiery affections, then to be found acquainted
with such pestilent passions.
So that Cornelius and Suetonius
doo leaue their Learning, to be a
Lampe or Loadstone vnto our liues,
that though we séeke to be rather
thralle to Looue, then by Learning
to haue liberty: yet theyr counsell is
héerein to be ruled by Learning, and
not to raunge beyonde reason: so
that Learning is héere vtter enemy
to looue.
               Furthermore, sithe I am so farre
entred, I will yet make a farther
discourse of the vnnaturall Looue of
a Father to his owne Childe: that
the terror of the tale may giue light
as in a Glasse, to beholde how vnchaste
and inconstant Looue, is for
the moste parte.
            
            
               
               Ladie.
               Beginne your tale, I attend the
same with dilligence.
            
            
               Scholler.
               WEll Madame, then know you
when Diophes was Kinge of
Egipt,
                  Herodotus. whose substaunce, treasure
and reuenues, were vtterly consumen
and spent, to maintaine a sumptuous
woorke, which he had then in
hande: the number of whose workemen,
was not so f
                     •
                  we as one hundred
thousand. Who labouring long
tyme vppon a pyle (as the Author
affirmeth) wasted so much wealthe:
as that he was not onely destitute,
but also desperate to comprehend the
same.A father compelleth his owne daughter to liue laciuiously. And séeing by no meanes possible
the same could be finished but
onely by the meane of money, which
then he did want: He commeth to his
Daughter, and commaundeth her
earnestly to giue her selfe to sensuall
prostitution, menacing her not onely
to pitch a great price vpon her honor:
but also to embrace euery one that

brought to her commodity. Which
soone after she fulfilled, no lesse with
regarde to her owne profit, then also
to performe her promise to her father.
For looke how many dealt or
had dalliaūce with her, of euery such
she demaunded a Stone: whereby at
last she gathered such a gayne, that
the price thereof builded the Piramides,
a certaine hill which beareth on
the top one hundreth and fiftie foote.
This Looue you must néedes confesse
was neither good nor godly: and therfore
Learning in this place had béene
better then Looue. For then the excessiue
expence of the father, had neuer
sought the sale and the spoyle of
his owne séede: but héere was Luste
and no Learning, which forced folly
bothe in Father and Daughter.
               Farther more as I remember,A straunge kinde of loouing. 
                  Lodouicus
Vartomanus writeth of a
straunge and wonderfull wooing or
looue making: which in a prouince in
India named Tarnassery, is commonly
vsed, and thus it is.
               
                  WHat time as any young man
becommeth amorous of any
Dame: he commeth to her, and
taking a péece of woollen cloathe
which he dippeth in Oyle, he clappeth
the same to his naked arme, and
setting fier thereto: he protesteth by
his Gods to endure no lesse torment
for her whom he looueth, then that
which in her sight she séeeth him to
receiue: signifying therby, that there
is no torment or martirdome that
may be ministred to a man, but that
he is able to abyde the same for her
sake. But what thinke you Madame?
wrought Looue or Learning first the
effect? If it were Looue, what néede
he then to scorche his skinne? If it
were Learning, as it cā be no other,
vnlesse Diuine inspiration put it in
his head, which if it were, yet was it
Learning, although applyed leawdely,
to a more lasciuious Luste.
               How thinke you Madame? haue
you examples enowe, or wyll you
any more?

               My sence is almoste surprised with
these detestable, yea or rather diuelish
discourses: for amongst all these
euils, although I confesse they haue
béene contributores to Cupid, there
hath not yet beene any without spot:
and yet the bad is as good as the best
to reasō with you. But leauing them
as they are, not yéelding any whit
to Learning: What thinke you now
Sir? of such Dames whose vertues
haue béene vaunted of the wisest,
praysed of Philosophers and Poets:
yea, and so lamented of the learnedst,
as that neither Pen nor Poet was
able to discourse the Looue and loyaltie,
which in their liues they ought
to their husbandes? ne like case, to
Recorde the reuenge with lyuing,
with theyr Husbands losse, they vsed

time as the death of her Anthonius,
was once to her reuealed: no myrthe,
no meate, no delight, was so much
desired of her as death Whom when
Octauius Caesar had perceiued, and
sawe by her passions, that she could
not preuent the same without perill

yea and so circumspectly conducted,

brought she to passe her will? she approoued
a straunger torment, then either

                  Allemaigne, when for treasō her husband
was by the Emperor Claudius
Marcello condemned to be deuoured
of Lions: she sued vnto the Emperor,
to participate the torment of her
Husband. And when she sawe no intercession
would serue, neither for
his suretie of life, nor for her selfe,
who desired to accompany him to
death: shée brake into such a furie,Augustino de panchio. as
not regarding the torment, she spake
the moste vyle and reprochefull

Emperor Claudius. Yea, and if his
Garde had not béene, shee had slaine
him. Which the Noble Emperor

not onely pardoned her Husband and
her selfe, but also gaue them largely
for to liue.

preferres Looue, or els there had

And therefore Learning hath made a
Register, and vollume of their vertues,
wishing others to immitate the

heard what a valliant exployt was
by Coclius atcheiued: What (quoth
he) shall Mutins he mewed vp in the
Senate, and heare such fame ringe in
Rome of Coclius? No. And with that
woord, he departed to the Campe of
his enemy, where he by his endeuor
shewed such a Looue to his Countey:

as neuer was the like since the death
of Curtius.

to passe with out prayse: I should
sure ecclipse the honour that by him
was doone to Roome, and also wrong
much the Knight, who for his Coūtry
counted his lyfe to be as nothing.
These and such other examples are
ryfe in memory, and therefore I but
giue notyce of theyr noble nature.
But Sir, how many were in Roome
of your profession, that for the publique
weale, would put himselfe in

And how if I named Marcius,
Regulus, Manlius, Coriolanus, yea,

               The liberallest that euer was,
was Esau, for he solde bothe his inheritaunce,

and also the blessing of
God, to his brother for a messe of
Pottage. I neuer knew a more liberall
gifte vpon so little gaine. And
as for the strongest that euer was:
I confesse that Sampson was he, for
that he was almoste inuincible, if he
had not fallen in his faithe.

                     •••
                  ,
Liberallest, and Strongest that
euer was, is Iehoua, the onely maker
and creator of all thinges, who by
his wisdome made the worlde, and
in the same hath not onely planted
and placed all kinde of creatures:
but also made man, to be the onely
Lord of all creatures els liuing. So
that who may compare with his

wisedome? or who can comprehend
a woorke of such woonder?
               As touching now the Learnedst
that euer was, I likewise affirme
that the Learning and Lesson, which
he first taught our Father Abraham,
was so profound, 
                     〈◊〉
                   of so great importance:
that all the Diuines in the
world, could neuer define the misterie
thereof.
               Thirdly, you confesse him to be th
                     •
                  
Loouingst that euer was, and I mus
                     •
                  
néedes allow it. For what greater
Looue could he showe to man: then
firste to make him, béeing nothing
but slime, like to his moste glorious
and diuine Image. Secondly, when
man had transgressed, and was by the
Law condemned, how Loouingly sent
he, according to his promise, his onely
sonne our Sauiour, to paye our
raunsome, and to deliuer vs from
deathe and damnation. What Looue
was euer like to this? and yet this
Looue was meant to man, before the
beginning of the worlde.
               
                  And now touching his liberallitie,
what Prince in the world from the
East to the West, hath power to doo
the like? Firste, he hath giuen vs
the world frankely to liue in, and all
the creatures therein contayned, to
be at our com
                     ••
                  ndement: he féedes
vs, he cloathes vs, he prouides vs
h
                     •
                  rbor, he hath giuen generally all
the world, and all things therein.
What can be more wished? or who
euer was so liberall? Lastely, the
strongest that euer was, like case
he is: for at his woorde, bothe Heauen
and the Earth shall faile, the
Mountaines fall, yea, and the Seas

                     ••
                  ell abooue the toppes of the same.
So that our God is inuincible, and
his woorkes not to be wondred at,
but praysed.
               And therefore Sir, now confesse
your selfe subdued, for Looue héere
got the vpper hande of Learning:
how say you? can you denie this?
haue I not prooued it bothe by Philosophie,
