                chanon of Marten abbey, translatour of this boke.
            NOt longe agoo, after I had translated into our englysshe tonge the boke called Regimen sanítatís Salerni, I hapned being at London to talke with the printer, and to enquire of hym, what he thought, and how he lyked the same boke: and he answered, that in his mynde: it was a boke moche necessarye, and very profitable for them that toke good hede to the holsome teachynges, and warely folowed the same. And this moche farther he added therto, that so farforthe as euer he coude here, it is of euery man very well accepted and allowed. And I sayd, I pray god it may do good, and that is all that I desyre. And thus in talkynge of one boke and of an other, he came forthe and sayde: that if I wolde take so moche peyne as to translate into Inglysshe the boke that is intitled De medicina guaiací, et morbo gallico wryten by that great clerke of Almayne Vlrich Hutten knyght, I shulde, sayd he, do a verye good dede. For seinge hit is

soth, as this great clerk writeth of this medicine Guaiacū, (For he hym self hath had the verye experience therof) how nedefull and howe beneficiall to the common wel

                  •
               d that I hadde bethoughte me and well aduysed his wordes, I answered: If I thought it wolde do good, I wolde take the peyne with all my verye harte, and hit were moche greatter: and yet (sayde I) I feare me, it be as moche or more than I am able to accomplysshe. For I doubt whether I may come to the clere vnderstonding therof or not: It is in ernest a matter straunge inough to translate, not onely for the names of herbes and other diuers thynges therin conteyned, but also for the phrase and eloquent style. But what so euer aunswere I made hym, I finally determyned to translate the sayd boke, as I haue done in dede, not so well I am sure, so playnly, and so exquisitely as many other coude, if they wold vouchesafe to take the peyn: but yet I trust I haue not moche erred from the true meanynge of the auctour. And I saye not the

contrarye, but somme wordes haue I lefte barely englysshed, and some nat at all, but they be suche, as are by those names in latine vsually knowen to phisitions, without whose counsaylle (specially those that be approued and knowen to be syngularly lerned in physike) I wolde counsaylle noo mā to be to bold either to practise or receiue any medicine.

            IT hathe pleased god, that in our tyme sycknesses shuld aryse, whiche were to our forefathers (as it maye be wel coniectured) vnknowē. In the yere of Christ. 1493. or there about, this pestiferus euyll creped amongest the people, not only in Fraunce, but fyrst appered at Naples, in the frenchemennes hoste, (wherof it toke his name) whiche kept warre vnder the frenche kyng Charles, before hit appered in any other place. By whiche occasion the frenche men puttynge from them this abh

And therfore he also was sought from ferre countreyes, with great resorte of men, offryng gyftes habundantly at his chappelle, whiche is in Vestrike. And bycause the name of sayncte Euager was not knowen among

                the common people of Almayne, they called it Fyacres sickenes for Euagers. Not enquerynge what the

So well these thynges do agree, whiche these mens myndes that declare god (as they thynke) do preache vnto vs. Than began the phisitions busynesse, whiche serche not what shulde take away this disese, but what was the cause therof, for they myght not abyde the syght of it, moche more they abstayned from touchynge. For whan it fyrste began, it was of suche fylthynes / that a mā wold scarsely thynke this syckenesse, that nowe reygneth, to be of that kynde. They were

byles, sharpe, and stondynge out, hauynge the similitude and quantite of acorne
                  •
               , from whiche came so foule humours, and so gret stynche, that who so euer ones smelled it, thought hym selfe to be enfect. The colour of these pusshes was derke grene / and the syght therof was more greuous vnto the pacient than the peyne it selfe: a

               d yet their peynes were as thoughe they hadde lyen in the fyre.
            ¶ This disease (not longe after his begynnyng) entred into Germania, where it hath wandred more largely than in any other place: whiche thynge I do ascribe vnto our intemperaunce.
            ¶ They whiche than toke counsayle of the sterres, prophisied / that euyl not to endure aboue .vij. yeres, wherin they were disceyued, if they ment of this disease and all the iuel that cometh therof: but if they mēt it of the forsaid most fylthye kynde, whiche cometh of hym selfe / & not only of enfection, but through the corruption of the ayre, or the ordinance of god: than were they not disceyued. For it taryed nat longe aboue the .vii. yere. But the infyrmitie, that came after, whiche remayneth yet / is nothynge so fylthye. For the sores at som tymes beth

            ¶It is thought this kynde nowe adayes to growe in any person, but through infection by defilynge of hym selfe, which thing especially happeneth by copulation. For it appereth manifestly, that yonge chyldren / olde men, and other, whiche are not gyuen to the bodily lust, beth very seldome enfected therwith. And the more that man is gyuen to wantonnesse, the sooner he is infected. And as they lyue, that beth taken therwith / so other it shortely leaueth them, or longe holdeth them, or vtterly consumeth them. For it is very easy vnto the Italians and Spanyardes, and to su

            ¶The causes of this disease. Capitu. ij.
            
               THe phisitions haue not yet certenly diffined the secret causes of this disease, although they haue long & peynfully wt great variete serched therfore, but in this thing al do agre, which is very euident, that through som vnholsom blastes of the ayre, which were at y• time / the lakes, foūtaines / flodes, & also the sees were corrupted, And therof the erth to receiue poison, The pastures to be enfected, venemꝰ vapors to come down frō the ayre, which liuinge creatures (in drawyng the breth) receyued. For this disese was foūd in other bestes like as ī mē. The astrologers fetch ye cause of this īfirmite from the sterres / saying, yt it ꝓcedeth of ye cōiūctions of Saturn & Mars, which was not long before, & of .ii. eclipsis of the son, & they do affirm, yt by th
                  •
               se signes they might perceyue many colerik, & fleumatike infirmities to folowe / which shuld long continue, & slowly depart, as Elyphācia / lepre, tetters, & al yl kynd of scabbes & boils, and what so euer euils deformeth & vnfasshioneth the body, as the gout, palsey / sciatica / ioynt ache, & other lyke dāgers. And that these thinges shuld chāce rather in the north part by reson of this signe Aquarius, wherin fel the fyrst ecclypse: And in the west part by reason of this sygne Piscis / in the whiche felle the

last eclyps. But the phisitions affirme this syckenes to come of yll and habundant humours, as of coler blacke advst yelowe and fleume salt or advst, and that of one of these alone, or of certayn, or els of al these mingled, whose sharpnes streking out to the outward partes of the body / burneth and dryeth the skynne, and fylleth it ful of scabbes, but that whiche cometh of rawe heuye and grosse humours / they say is driuen into the ioyntes, and causeth greatte peine in them, and to arise knobbes & swellinges, & knottes to gether, and the skynne to ryuell. And moreouer the heed to ake, wherby ye beauty of the body is clene altered & gone. Some breuely cōcluding say, that this infirmite cometh of corrupt, burnt, & enfect blode. And al these thynges were in doubtful disputatiō, ye nature therof not yet knowen, but now it is knowē, they be also apꝓued. for in myn opiniō this sicknes is no other thing / but a postumatiō, & rotting of vnpure blode: the whiche after it beginneth to drie, it turneth into swelling & hard knobbes, the which thinge ꝓcedeth of the lyuer corrupt. ¶ To knowe more of the nature or qualities of this infirmitie shulde be very tedious & hard to iuge. For we se in our time, what diuers concertatiōs / & opiniōs haue bē to boldly disputed:

and what peyne the phisitions haue taken therin, sens the begynnynge therof. The phisitions of Germaynie, for the space of ij. yeres, meddled with suche disputation, and yet whan I was but a chylde, they vndertoke to heale me: but what profite cam therof, the ende hath shewed, not withstondynge they were bolde to medle with strāge dregges and spices, and to myngle and minystre many thynges / whiche they shulde not haue ministred. And I remembre / they forbode me to eate peasen. For in some places there grow certeyn wormes in thē with wynges, of the whiche hoggeflesshe was thought to be in

               ected, bicause that best specially was deceas

            ¶Into what disese the french pockes are tourned. Ca. iii.
            THe peynes of this dysease all redye rehersed are estemed in maner as no peines: for this disease tourneth it selfe into great inconueniēce and peyne that naturally it

hath of hym selfe: In so moche that all maner of syckenes, hauynge or causynge any peyne in mannes ioyntes, semeth to be conteyned therin. For fyrst there is sharpe ache in the ioyntes / and yet nothynge appereth: afterwardes the gatheryng to gether of humours causeth the membres to swell, but after that suche vyle matter is waxed harde, that a man shall fele the vehemente peynes therof. This is the fyrste commyng therof. For it semeth to edifye and fortifye a castelle, there to rest a longe season, and thens to disperse and caste into euery part of the bodye all maner of ache and peynes. And the longer the sayde swellynges tarye fro rottynge
                  •
                and rypynge / the more peyne shall the pacient suffer. And aboue all other peynes of this infyrmitie, this is the violē
               test, and that troubleth man moste. I my selfe had suche a lyttell knobbe, and swelling aboue my left hele in the inner syde, the whiche after it was indurate and harde, by the space of .vij. yere, coude by no power of oyntementes or any maner lappynges and cherysshynges be made softe / or caused to putrifie and rotte, but contynued stylle lyke a boone, vntylle that by the helpe of Guaiacum it vanysshed away by lyttel and

lytel. This thing as touching womē resteth ī their secret places, hauing in those places litle prety sores ful of venomꝰ poison, being very dāgerous, for those yt vnknowingly medle with thē. The which sicknes gottē by such infected womē, is so moch the more vehemēt & greuous, how moch they be inwardly poluted and corrupted. By this the senowes (at somme tymes) do slacke & wax hard again, at somtime they shrinke, & some time the sicknes turneth it self into the gout, or into the pal
                  •
               ey or īto apoplexi & infecteth many one with lepre. For it is thought, that these infirmities be very neighbours one to an other. And yt for many resons, which are comē to both euils. They that be takē with pockes, of
                  •
               en times becom lepres, and often times through the sharpnes of their peynes they shake and queuer as men in a fevre.
            ¶After all this ther buddeth out & appere smal holes & sores, which turne thē self into cākers & phistuls, or cōtinual sores: & the more they putrifie, the more thei diminishe ye bone. And whā the bones be putrified & corrupt, the paciēt through longe cōtinuāce of siknes, waxeth lene, for the fleshe consumeth awey / & ther remayneth but onely the skyn to couer the bones withal
                  •
                & through this

many a one chāseth to be thisiques, the whiche inwardly be full of corruption. Beside all this, out of this infirmitie floweth an other, whiche some men do calle cacesia / the whiche fylleth a mans flesh & also his skyn full of water: Somme haue sores in theyr bladder, & oftē tymes many mens lyuer & stomake is vtterly consumed by this infyrmite. And in this thing their opinion is fals that say that the gathering to gether of humours & swellinges, wrinkels, and knottes come not of the nature of this infirmite, but that it chanced only to those that haue bene rubbed and anoynted with oyntmētes made with quick siluer. I am sure, the most part of the phisitions of Almayne be of this opinion, but yet they haue ben disceyued in this sickenes, as they be in many other. For I knowe it for a suretie, there be some, that haue had these infirmities & sicknesses, whiche were neuer noynted with quicke siluer, as I haue had experience in my father Vl riche de hoten.

               VVhan the phisitions were thus amased, the surgiōs came forward in the same errour, and putte to theyr handes: and first they beganne to burne the sores with hote yrons. But for as moche as it was an infinite labour / to touche them all, they wente aboute to aduoyde them by oyntementes, but dyuerse men vsed dyuers oyntementes, and all in vayne, except he added quicke siluer therto, they bete for this vse the pouders of mirre, of mastique / of ceruse, of beyberies, of alam, bolli armenie, cinaber / of veermelon, of corall, of burned salte / of rusty brasse, of leddrosses, of rust of yron, of Rosen, of Turpentyne, and of al maner of best oyles, oyle of bey / oile of pure roses & terebinthiū, oyle of gyneper, of greatte effect, oyle of spike / swynes greace, fatte of oxe feete and butter, made specially in may, talowe of gootes and hartes, virgins honye, pouder of rede wormes dryed into duste, or consumed with oyle and beaten, camfere, enforbiū & castory: & with .ij. or .iij. of these foresayde thynges myngled to gether / they anoynted the sicke mans ioyntis, his armes,

his thyes / his backe bone, his neckebone, with other places of his bodye. Some anoynted them ones a day, some twyes, som thryes, some foure tymes. The paciente was shutte in a stufe, kept with continuall and feruent hete, some .xx. and some .xxx. hole dayes: And some were layd in a bedde within the stewe / and anointed, and couered with manye clothes, and were compelled to sweate. Parte of them at the seconde anoyntynge beganne to faynt meruaylously. But yet the oyntment was of suche strēgth & effect, that what so euer disease was in the hyer part of the body / it drew into the stomake, & from thēs vp into the brayn, & thēs the disese auoyded both by the nose and the mouthe, and dyd putte the pacient to suche peyne, that excepte they toke good hede, theyr tethe fell out, all theyr throtes, theyr longes / their roffes of the mouthes, were full of sores, their iawes did swelle, their teethe were lensed, and contynually there auoyded the moste stynking skome and mater, that coude be, and what so euer it rāne vpon, by and by it was polluted and infected / wherby theyr lyppes so touched gathered sores, and within forthe their chekes were greuously peyned. Al the place, where

And yet in the mene time taking what so euer thing was thought to withstōde & resist it. For we vsed bathes & herbis lapped about thē, & drīkes & coresies, And for this we had arsnicke, inke, calcantū, verdegres, or aqua fortis, which wrouzt in vs so bitter peyn / yt they myght be iuged very desirous of life, yt had not leuer dy thā so to ꝓlōge theyr life, but tho curingis were most bitter & peinful, which were made with oyntmētes, And was also so moche ye more dāgerus bicause the ministers of it, knewe not ye operation therof. For ye surgions only dyd not vse it, but euery bold felow wēt about playing the phisition, gyuing to al maner of mē one ointmēt, either as he had sene it ministred to other, or as he had suffered it him selfe.

were suffred to practise on all persons what they wold while the phisitiōs were done as ī an vniuersal errour & ignorāce. And so without order or rule, with tormēt of heate and sweat plētie, al were cured after one faciō, without regarde of time, habite, or cōplection. Nother these ignorante anointers had not so moche knowledge, as with laxes to take away the mater, whiche caused the euyl, or to diete them, or appointe any diuersite of meate: but at length the matter must com to this point, that they shulde lose their tethe, for they were losed, their mouth was all in a sore, & through coldnes of the stomak & filthy stench, thei lost appetite. And although their thirst was ītollerable, yet foūd they no kind of drink to help the stomak, many were so light ī their brain, that they coud not stōd, & som were brought into a madnes & not ōly their hādis trēbled & shoke therwt, but also their fete & al ye body: som mūbled ī their speking as lōge as they liued, & cowd haue no remedy.

And whan the lyme was dissolued, and after a lyttell reste laye in the botom: I toke awaye the skome that swom aboue, and mouinge not the lyme / powred oute the clerest water / and kepte that for my pourpose / whan I wolde occupie it: I toke a sponge or a lynnen clothe / and depped hit in the water, somme tyme rolled, as I moughte, and often tymes warmed and moysted my sores therwith, wasshynge and wypynge away all the fylthynesse. Thanne I toke a peece of clothe, so moysted, and lapte it aboute my sores. And with this water my peynes were eased. and the swellynge swaged, the sores were clensid, and the heate and enflamations dryuen

awaye. whiche thynge is to be meruaylled at, seing the nature of lyme otherwise is to kendle. I founde nothynge lyke this: And me thought I was well holpen therwith, and had auoyded the distruction / that was at hande. In so cruel assautes of this disese I vsed also cassia, if I wolde be laxatiue, and dyd often tymes sweat / & let go bloode drawen oute with gourdes. And whan I was in Italy monysshed, that to eate in the mornynge the quantite of a walnutte of rasins terebinthia, shuld be of great efficacite to amende the fautes of the bloode, what maner of thyng it is I knowe not / and to make the bely lanke, and helpe the stomak, whiche bothe thynges I founde trewe, I vsed the same. They sayde also, that it dyd helpe no lyttell thynge the synowes, and strengthed the ioyntes and membres. And by this meanes and abstinence of meate and drynke, and good dyete, I auoyded many thynges / whiche moughte haue vtterly distroyd me in so longe & iniurious seson, for the mooste parte wandrynge abrode in the worlde, and through pouerte dryuen to moche aduersite, neuer at rest and quietnes, but alwayes vexed and troubled. And haue so preserued my selfe, that all thoughe my

legges were eaten with so many depe and greuous soores, yet was there not one synewe hurte / nor one bone perysshed. And if at any tyme the disease toke my face, no euylle happened in my mouthe and tongue, so that the inwarde partes were preserued: For I voyded awaye those thynges, that myghte hurte my stomake, and with a rare helpe defended my lyghtes and lounges: and by these helpes I moughte suffer and dryue forthe this dysease, but clerely putte hit awaye I coude not: whiche thynge was the easynge of peyne, and nat the cuttynge away of the cause of payne, the differryng of euyll, and not the takynge away therof. A better remedy came of Guaiacus, ye of that onely came helthe, which I do intend nowe to discribe.
         
         
            ¶The discription of Guaiacum and the fyndynge therof, and name. Cap. vi.
            
               IF we ought to giue thankes vpwarde vnto god, bothe for good and euylle: howe moche are we bounde for the gyfte of Guaiacum? ye howe moche doth the gladnes and ioye of his benignite towarde vs, passe the sorow and peyn of that infirmitie? The vse of this wod was brought to vs out of an ylond namyd Spagnola, this ylonde is in the west nigh to the contrey of Amerik set in that place where the length of Amerike, stretchynge into the northe / doth ende: and was founde af late dayes amonge the newe londes, which were vnknowen by the olde tyme. All the inhabitauntes of that ylonde somtyme be diseased with the french pockes, lykewyse as we be with the mesels, & small pockes. Nor they haue no other remedy for it but this.
            ¶A certayne noble man of Spayne, being tresaurour in that prouince, was greuously troubled with that infyrmitie: And after the people of that londe hadde taught hym that medicine, he broughte the maner and vse therof into Spayn, shewing of what power & vertu it was in those partes. The phisitiōs wold not alow it, ꝑceyuyng that theyr profyt wold decay therby / not withstanding

at lēgth they toke in hande to cure with the same wood, but with such arrogācie, attributyng so moch to theyr preceptes and order, that excepte they were obserued, they affirmed / this woode shulde be spende in vayne. Whiche thinge I meruayle they coude perswade to any man, and make hym beleue it. seinge it is playnly knowen / that in that ylande were neuer phisitions. And yet hath this woode Guaiacum alwayes bene there vsed. But in this cure what besynes is mete for the phisition, I wyll here after declare. Nowe I wylle speke of the thynge intended. They haue gyuen it this name Guaiacum. For so the Spaniardes wryte it with latyne letters / folowynge theyr owne maner of sounde: whiche worde the people of that ylande pronounce with open mouthe Huiacum.
            ¶And Paulus Ritius shewed me at the citie of August / that he harde say of a Spanyarde / whiche had ben in that yland, that the fyrste syllable Gua, of this name / was nat pronounced of the Spagnolenses with G, but that his owne tonge dydde requyre it so to be wryten. And they of that Ilonde sounde it with, V, puffed out, as though it were Huiacum, a worde of .iii. syllables

with them / and not Guaiacum. We maye gyue vnto it some excellent name, callynge it lignum vite / as Philo the phisition called his dregges the handes of god: and thi

                daye the phisitions with great boste calle their cōfections manus Christi, apostolicū / gratia dei, Antidotum, Paulium, and many other such superstitious names. They say it groweth lyke an ashe with vs in height / & is rounde / bryngyng forth a nutte moche like a chesse nutte: his tymbre is oyle and fatte, in colour like boxe, but somwhat blackyshe. And they iudge that the best, that hath most blacke: but that whiche is lyke to boxe, differeth from that / whiche is blacke. For this is with in / and thother without: or to speake more playnely, the blacke is as hit were the harte and marowe. The wodde is meruaylous heuy / for the leest pece of hit, caste into the water, synkethe streyghte to the botome. There is no wodde so harde / as it. For hit is so harde, that hit wyll not cleue: nother hitherto haue we sene any, that was chyned. And they that selle it say, it wyll in no wyse yane or chappe.

for what purpose it serueth: This gōme is somwhat black / & shortly after it is fallē away, it is verye harde. The barke is not so thick, but is meruaylous hard. which tokens wel marked, I thynk he that shal coūterfete this woode / can not deceyue the byer. For be it a man may be deceyued in the coloure, howe is hit possible all these thinges to be in one / a fatnes, smellinge, somewhat like rosen / suche weyght as no wodde hath beside? Than the gōme that cometh from it / whā it flameth? such hardnes that may scātly be cut? And the lest pece cast into the water wyl nat swym aboue? And the tast ones knowē wyl neuer suffer a mā to erre, which as it is to al men vnplesant, so is it to me ye very plesant. They say it cōtinueth not after it be sodden / but paulleth / in the sommer after .iij. dayes, & in the wynter somewhat later. And therfore we must chose the fattest and weyghtiest therof. For that which is olde / is lyght and leane. Vpon this description lette the phisitions, if hit please them, drawe out the causes of suche efficacite by theyr longe disputations, as for me I more reioyce, that it is, than I serche what maner of thynge it is. Howe be it I graunt them worthy of moche thanke / that shall

Somme wolde, that lyght water and clere shulde be gotten for this purpose. Some admytte all maner swete water indifferently, bycause in sething what so euer it be, it is purified. All wold that good diligence and hede shulde be taken in time of sething, that it rūne nat ouer / or boyle to fast, & they byd that the potte be close stopped, that nothynge brethe out: but whā the skom is perceiued to ryse, it must be softely opened, and the skomme taken out, and so couered agayne.

The colour of this decoction is somewhat lyke muddye water, whan hit is somewhat troubled. Wete lynnen in it, and it wexeth grene of a meruaylous shewe.

And I wolde nothynge shulde be added vnto suche a thynge, beinge of suche power, where as it nedeth not. For what nedeth a man there to bestowe his labour, where as no nede is: And to say the trouth the relesse of Guaiacum is not so greuous that it requireth to be tempred with hony: Yea were it not for my maysters the phisytions all men wolde be contented therwith. Howe be it what nedeth me to name phisytions, whan I speke onely but of tryflers? For they that be connnynge and expiert, as is O moste noble prince, Stromer thy phisition (and throughe frendeshyppe myne also) and thy other phisition Coppus, suche I saye, vnderstode and knewe, howe hit is not conuenyente, eyther to meddle it with vnknowen thynges, and myngle theym / or elles to adde oughte vnto these thynges, whiche as yet are not perceyued to lacke oughte.

Verily to make my cause good with the, excellent prince, and to defende my selfe agaynst them, that by this occasion mought accuse me, as one that spake wordes more snappysshe than besemed me.

Therfore if he be cured in wynter, or in Autumne, he muste soke, that he haue fyre in his chaumber, erely in the mornynge speciallye before daye: for than is the colde feruente: he muste cause the cleftes of the wyndowes, if any be, to be stopped with playster, or other lyke matter: and vppon the chaumbre doore muste he hange carpettes, or other lyke thynges, within and withoute, that no colde or ayre entre into the chaumbre / or comme oute. whanne he is thus ordered, his meate muste be dymynisshed. Fyrste the fourthe parte of that he was wonte to take, and than the thyrde parte, and shortely after the one halfe, that he maye lerne to beare hunger
                  •
                and his wyne muste be well watered. Thanne muste he take a pourgacyon,

other with regarde that hit be suche a one as shall be thought sufficient to cutte awaye the cause, or take awaye the matter, that norissheth the disease, other such a one withoute any regarde at all, as maye emptye the hoole bealy. For that thynge, as I perceyue, onely is requyred, whiche thynge done, thanne maye ye thervppon begynne this worke after this maner. The docoction whiche was fyrste sodden and is strongest, must be ministred vnto him twise a day mylke warme, a gobblet or cyat ones in the mornyng at .v. of. the clocke, or ther about / and agayn at nyght, at viii. of the clocke, we call a ciates, a cuppe that wyll receyue half a pound, wherof we may gather, seing .viii. pounde of water is required to the sethynge of one pounde of wod, & the one halfe therof muste be consumed in the sething, that so there muste .iiii. pounde remayne, and muste drynke therof twyse a day, that the decoction of one pounde of Guaiacum is suffycient for foure dayes. For hit is nowe a commen maner with phisitions, to measure theyr syquores by weyghte, and they haue cleane caste vp the names of measures. It muste be dronke at one draughte withoute any brethe takynge,

After he hath dronke, lette hym reste more than .iiii. houres, and let hym the fyrste .ii. be couered / that by the helpe of heate this medicine maye be digested abrode into the membres, and the pacient maye swete out that that noyeth. whiche thyng to do howe profytable it is, I wyll declare whan place cometh. And it shall not hurt, if he be close couered one hole houre before he drynke, that he may be hotte.
            ¶Some wyll not in any wyse he shuld rise frome his bedde in fyue houres after he hath taken his ciates of drynke.
            ¶He must take his meate in the myddaye, and not before, and than as lyttell as may be, for this medicine aboue all thynges requireth an emptye bealy. And therfore he muste eate, nat to fyll his emptynes, but to beare vppe the lyfe, not to gather strength but to kepe hym self frō feinting. Nother is there any ieoperdy to be feared. For Guaiacum hath great strength in it selfe both to refresshe, and also to comforte, not suche as be full / but onely those that are emptye. Ye they saye, that none faylleth, eate he neuer so lyttell, so that he drynke faythfully this decoction. In the meane tyme, he shall not be anoynted in the out syde, excepte he

haue soores or swellynges. And for this there is a whyte oyntment made of Cerussa, rose oyle of rosis, with camphire, whiche is layde on with a lynnen clothe. Some anoynt them only with the skom of Guaiacum, or els drye it into pouder, and caste it vppon them. And besydes this skomme / there is nothyng of this decoction occupied in the out parte. Some be healed in shorte tyme / and some in longe. The moste parte in .xxx. dayes. They commaunde hym to be pourged agayne the .xv. daye.

haue kepte one order of eatynge equallye through out the .xxx. dayes: and truly the stronglyer a man abideth to hunger, the better and more quyckely he shall be healed. And although the desyre of eatyng growe dayly more and more, yet must he remembre to absteyne, comfortynge him selfe with the suretie of helth, if he so do. For the bodye beynge so wasted and emptied, not only with hunger / but also with sweat, ye being longe tyme as a deed bodye, through the greuousnes of this euyll, shall hyghe faste to the appetyte of meate and drynke.

Wherfore, feryng the colde, bycause wynter than begonne, I intended to kepe in other .x. dayes: but I was compelled by the phisitions counsell to go abrode, and put it in auenture / which thyng happed not amysse. Howe be it the soores that I had than, were not depe in the fleshe, or swollen outwarde: but onely in the hier parte of the skynne, and lacked nothynge els but skynne to couer them with: whiche they had scantly the .xl. daye after I went out. And I that tyme, in very sharpe wynter, made my iourneye frome Vindele into Fraunce. The causes of this slowe healyng I dyd coniect this to be. The phisition suffred me to eate more mete (as I after perceyued) than I shulde haue done, and also

he sodde my drynke thynner than he ought. For I occupied nat fully .v. pounde of this wodde, where as other o

For so moche as he oughte not to haue loked what my body was thanne, but what maner body it was wonte to be, and agayn the nature of this medicine is suche, that it wyl suffer none to faynt for lacke of strengthe. Wherfore be they neuer so weke, they ought not therfore to ministre the lesse, but rather somwhat the more. For it dothe nothing sodenly, but werketh helth by lytel & litel. And therfore I alow best that decoction, that was longest at the fyre / and is comme to a lyttell of moche wode: so that I wolde counsaylle them, to the intente hit mought be the stronger, to sethe hit often tymes to the thyrde parte.

Not withstandynge I dispyse not the phisitions, that dispute of the daungers, that maye chaunce to drye and hotte bodyes, if they be dryuen to this strayte dyete / bryngynge for them Galen and also Hipocras, whiche seme in many places to be agaynst this exquisite dyete in fedynge. But of these that vsed Guaiacum / I sawe as yet none in ieoperdye, and I gather at this tyme preceptes and monitions out of experience, & not doctrine out of bokes. And also I my selfe am of drye and hotte complexion, and yet this hūger brought me nother into a ptisike nor etike: whiche thyng they seme to feare.

            ¶In the tyme of this cure, the pacient muste forbeare all busynes, and cutte away all sadde thoughtes, and rest from al care. And therfore they commaunde reste and

Let the sicke person here syngers and minstrelles, and gyue hym selfe to sportes, pastymes, and musike, and some tyme delyte hym selfe with mery talkynge. But to company with woman, howe moche he muste eschew that, I wyl shewe hereafter. I toke great pleasure in redynge & makynge mery thynges.

the onely comforte / not to se other eate, nor to see meate, nor to smell the sauour therof. Neuer the lesse whan any perceyueth hym selfe to faynt, and wexe feble for lacke of meate, I wolde not that he shulde by and by receyue meate or straunge confection, to comforte and brynge agayne his strengthe, but to refresshe his spirites with odours & and pleasant smelles: for euen with the sauour and smelle of suche odors Galenus thynketh the spirite and lyfe to be nourysshed and comforted.

For I playnly knowe / that in an oynion was sometyme suche vertue

Of these som prefer orenges: other prefer cotonia mala. Vineger is also praised / but specially vineger made with roses: and musterde is wel alowed. For these thynges, saye they, do refreshe the wyttes, and susteyne the strengthes. As for cynamom / nutmegges, styracke / citrous / saffron, a gisoflower, muske, camphire / and suche costly ware, I leue to deinte felowes, But cummin, anesse, coryander, lauander, amarake, roses, mynt, rue, rosemary, violettes, sage, castorye, with other growynge

amonges vs, none of the phisitions that haue any iudgemeut, improueth: but they affirme these to be good for this purpose. And I oftentymes do vse such helpes to the great comforte of my helthe. The sycke man may also vse rubbynges, so that they be softely done, by all the tyme of his saide lyinge: whiche as they are for other thynges profitable, so I beleue they wolde not hurte in this thynge. Lette his heed be rubbed with a warme clothe, and combed with an yuory combe.

and agayne with abstinence and hunger to drawe out and emptie the holle body: But what saye ye therto? In that rude countrey where this Guaiacum groweth / are no phisitions: no straunge nor ferfetched wayes nor rules of phisike: But perchaunce men vse there some herbe or rote to purge with, and all do vse one thynge / not to take away the grefe, but that whan the bely is emptied Guaiacum may the better worke. wherfore in this my counsell is, that ye tourment not your belye with thynges costely prepared / and speciallye to auoyde the compositions made of many thynges.

as well as his owne nayles. This phisition whan I was wrytinge these thynges, and takyng my iourney from Frankeford, wher he was wrytynge his recipe, was asked of a certayne frende of myn, what he thought of Guaiacum: I haue not sene it / sayd he, but what so euer it be, the weyght / the colour, the sauour, must be consydered in quā

Thou arte deceyued sayde he, it is no newe disease, seinge Plini wryteth therof. Than I, beynge desyrous to knowe, what he knewe in Plini, that I knew not, asked him, what name Plinie gaue vnto this disease? Mentagram sayde he, quía vexat mentem, that is to say, bycause hit vexith a mannes

Than sayde I / why and do not other infirmities and sycknes than tourmēt and vexe a mans mynde? or doth not frensyes, madnes, the fallynge euyll, and other rauysshynges of the wyttes this thing more than the frenche pockes? As he was interpretynge I can nat telle what: good olde man, quod I, lerne agaynste an other tyme to answere more wysely / and specially in suche thynges as apertaigne to mans helth.

Which thing Paulus Ricius, a phisition of pure iugement and hygh erudition, approueth, and more ouer affirmeth / that he knoweth by playne experience, that no nation is more apte vnto this dyete. But if we had not sene some restored vnto helthe through the helpe of Guaiacum, and nowe shuld begyn to proue hit: we oughte not beleue, that god were so moche sette agaynste vs, that he wolde eyther kepe this helthfull medicine from vs, or defraude vs of the vertue therof, seynge it was brought frō Spagnola into Spayn, and had the same vertue there, whiche hit hadde at home: excepte a man wylle saye, that Guaiacum disdayneth to be caried vnto vs / his nature fyrste not chaunged, or whan it commeth to the Germaynes / that than it suffreth that great and myghtye power and strengthe of his, to be taken from hym, and no where els. And it is playnely knowen, that with vs his helpe is very present, and peraduenture more presente than els where. And our men, as they be moche gyuen to surfetynge, so can they, if nede require, abyde very longe and strongly bothe

hunger and thurste. And more ouer as our bodyes abunde with heate, so are they very stronge. For after the iudgement of Aristotle, they that inhabite cold countreys, haue moche naturall hete in them, and they that haue moche heate, for the most parte are of great strength. And bycause the Almayns vse moche eatyng and drinkyng, Ricius the phisition was demaunded of late, what he thought, whether it were best to remyt som what vnto them in this cure of this sklēder & thinne dyete, & he sayde: No by sayncte mary, not thus moche, but rather handle them the strayter, lette these great belyes vsed in eatynge and drynkynge be dryuen to a moche thynner dyete than these thynne and leane Italians. And he shewed me hym selfe, that he hadde punysshed with hunger one of these fatte felowes .x. dayes lenger than he ought to haue done, bicause he wold haue nothynge remayne that myght let the operation of Guaiacum.
            ¶This thyng and suche other I do gladly reherse by Ricius, and do make often mention of Stromer, that suche as shall rede this boke may vnderstond, whom I cal good and right phisitions, and how vnworthy I thynke these comen tormenters of mē of the dignite of this title & name. And that

straunge countreyes may knowe, that Germaynie hath some good and excellent phisitions. And that I delyte as moche in the lernynge and amitie of them, that be good and well lerned, as I hate these vnlerned and foole hardy felowes, whiche after they be for theyr moneye ones made doctours, streyght professe / that they can reuyue the deed, and restore lyfe to them that are buryed. But I wylle retourne vnto these .ij. whiche be of an other sorte, of the whiche two Stromer, whan I asked hym the laste yere a medicine to pourge me with, sayde / Do not vexe thy stomake with medicines in this age of thyn / in whiche nature is able of her selfe to do all thynges moche better. For as he is very scarse in pourynge in of medicines / so bryngeth he all sycke people vnto a verye strayte rule of dyet. Wherfore whan he had taken in hande to cure one in the cytie of August after these wayes, and he said, that he feared, leste he coude not absteyne hym selfe from women: Seing than (saide he) thou haste decreed to dye, thou hast no nede of my helpe, & so forsoke hym, and lefte him to his intemperancie.

            ¶what tyme is beste to take herevnto. Capilo .xiiii.
            
               IT semethe for somme causes that folowe, that it is better to proue this cure in sommer than in wynter. Fyrst bicause (as Galene sayth) the moisture in sommer increasethe and runneth in all the body, and dothe goo and comme: and therfore the pestilent humours maye lyghtly be seperated from the good, and they may be expelled and banysshed: and these that be holsome & good kept. Secondely bycause all diseases in wynter do fasten their rotes deper and take surer holde / and in sommer contrarye wyse, the humours be styll mouynge, and the body is apte vnto all chaunges. But these considerations appertayne generally vnto al diseses: But as concernynge this our cure of Guaiacum, for as moche as a great parte of hit stondethe in dyete and sufferaunce of great honger, therfore it is moste expedient to begynne in sommer. In that season a mā may better awaye with this dyete thanne in wynter, whan men are very hungry. For if the body, beynge hotte and boylynge of it selfe / as it is in sommer, shulde moreouer be loded with meate / hit wolde lyghtely be dissolued into diseases. But in the wynter it

woll not so
                  •
                / for so moche, as Hipocrates saythe / that in wynter a mannes bodye inwardly aboundeth with naturall heate, and outwardly lacketh it, for so moche as than in auoydeth and fleeth from the sharpenes of the cold, wherwith the body outwardly is compassed / into the inwarde partes, as vnto a stronge holde and castell: and there closeth it selfe vppe: but contrary wyse in sommer the same naturall heate in mannes body foloweth, as Aristotle thynkethe, the nature of the ayre, and therfore puttethe forthe it selfe, and fleeth out to the extreme partes of the bodye. But so i
                  •
                is, that the very nature and propretie of this medicine is / to reduce into the body, and bryng home agayne suche naturall heate as is loste. And therfore this it semeth vnconueniente to go in hande with, or putte in experience this cure in the winter. For thā is it thought daungerous, whan the hete of the outward partes is drawen vnto the inwarde partes, le

               te the outwarde lymmes be forsaken and lefte emptie of their strengthe and power / specially in them that be colde of nature, whiche otherwyse in the wynter lose theyr heate, and haue their bodyes slayn through the violence of colde, and be lyke vnto deed

folke.
            ¶But here maye we not passe ouer that, whiche Coppus admonysshethe, sayinge, Guaiacum moueth a manne to sweatte, castynge out the euyll humours, that be noyfull to the body: Therfore saythe he, the sommer is moste apte for this cure / whan the humoures are more subtylle / and the skyn thynner. And in the wynter the wayes and poores, by the whiche the sweate shuld haue his course, and be expelled: are stopped, and the humours gathered to gether, and clodded. But on the other syde for so moche as in this cure done by Guaiacum, the sycke are greued with nothynge more, than with thurste it is thought, that the syck may worse absteyne from drynke in somer than in wynter. wherfore in Spayne, and where the heate is vehement, they durst not hytherto proue this experyment in the sommer. Furthermore in wynter (after the mynd of Alexander Aphrodisius) there ingendreth on man through moche eatynge. (For than haue men moche better appetite thanne in other seasons) an humour called pituita, that is fle

and kepte. These thynges we haue spoken as touchynge the tymes of feruente heate and feruent colde, and nowe we wyll speke of the other two seasons that be betwyxte bothe, of the whiche two, Autumne semeth the worste of bothe. For than is there great abundance of all maner syckenes, and the humours waxe worse and worse, bycause this tyme of the yere is vnegall and without order, alwayes chaungynge and inconstant / bryngyng in many kyndes of diseses. For as Celsus affirmeth, Autumne kylleth many a one.
            ¶Furthermore the french pockes are very noyfull to the synowes, and the sayd author teacheth, that wynter and Autumpne be not mete nor apt tymes vnto medicines / for the resolution of the synowes. But these are the reasons of them that dispute generally and speake not onely of the vse of Guaiacū. Wherfore this I thynke, that sommer (at the lefte wayes in Asmayne) may be beste taken: but that is that parte of sommer / that begynneth whanne vere endeth, as in Maye, for than there is not here so moche heate, but the sycke maye well abyde and suffer thyrste: And in wynter the colde is very feruent, and lykewyse in vere and Autumne

the colde is sharper, than the sycke may abyde in this cure. For it is one of the chiefe poyntes for hym that is restored by Guaiacum, with all diligence to eschewe colde. And as for suche incommodities / as maye happen in the sommer, to the intente they may the lesse be feared, I haue spoken of before, and shall repete them agayne, whan place shall be. And neuer the lesse at this tyme I do affirme, that this drynke of Guaiacum dothe meruaylously stere vp the naturalle power and strengthe, and hath power and myghte to quycken and to make lusty the body / whiche for lacke of natural heate is weake and consumed: Which thinges if they were not as I haue sayde, and had not Hipocrates in a certayne place / if I well remembre me, sayde: that Vere and Autūne are the most aptest times to let blod and minister medicines: verily the counsell of Celsus shuld than haue semed best, whiche saythe: that Vere is the holsomest tyme to go to phisike / & next vnto that wynter, and that is very dangerous, & Autumn mooste daungerous of all.

            ¶And nexte vnto this the vse of wyne is knowen moste pestilent, an muste be auoyded in this cure. For it loseth the ioyntes of the body, and hurteth the synowes. And for as moche as it hath vehement power to enter into the lymmes, and shake al the body / it is thought, that this decoction of Guaiacum shall not profyte in his body, that vseth wyne, but shall rather put hym in ieoperdy and feare of deathe, whan these thynges Guaiacum and wyne, which are most contrary, mete and come to gether. Therfore some there be, that monyssheth to absteyne from wyne an hoole moneth after the tyme of this cure be paste, for so moch as this medicine kepeth his course of workynge many dayes after it is dronken. And therfore left any thynge shulde stoppe or set it, they take away the vse of wyne, and he that fleeth the voluptuous pleasure of the body muste take hede, that he gyue no place to glotonie. For the olde prouerbe witnesseth, that hunger neuer begetteth adulterye. And agayne it is sayd / that Venus waxeth cold without brede and wyne. Aelianus wryteth, that Zaleucus the lawyere of Locrense, forbede

sycke men wyne vnder payne of dethe with out the phistions coūsel. But be it the nature of Guaiacum might suffer this voluptuous act, & dyd not abhorre wyne? yet dothe the phisitions bokes with ful mouth make mention that they are veri hurtful & greuous vnto that body, whiche is take, with this sickn

               s, and principally for the ioyntes. Wherfore Celsus reporteth, that there were some that were vexed with ache in theyr limmes, whiche through one yeres abstinence from wyne and women haue bene safe all theyr lyfe. And the same Celsus concludeth / that suche as are borne chaste / or be gelded, or chyldren, or euer they fall to womans company / and lykewyse women, excepte them that haue theyr flowers stopped, are seldom tempted with this disease. And Alexander in his problemes sayth, that suche as drinke water onely, are quycker in all senses than other. For wyne stoppeth the wayes of the mynde / and dulleth the senses. And Cicero sayth / that for so moche as wyne profiteth the sycke but selde, and hurteth very often, it is moche better not to gyue it, than vnder the hope of doubtfull helth to runne into open ieoperdie. And Venus, in what so euer state a man be, coldeth the bely, & dryeth it,

if Aristotle be true. For in suche couplyng / the naturall heate departeth, and throughe the euaporation that than is made / drynes is caused and ingendred.
            ¶Lo sobernes and chastite two holy ordynances of lyfe, be the principall obseruation in this thynge, the highest precept / the chief poynt of helth, whiche diligently kepte, no ieoperdye can ryse. For be it they tary the medicine or vtterly stoppe and lette it, yet they putte not a manne in ieoperdye of his lyfe / whan they be neglected.
         
         
            ¶That salte muste be eschewed in this cure. Capitu. xvj.
            AMonges all the thynges that muste be auoyded / somme men do meruayle, why salt is forbiddē to be vsed for the space of this dyete, consyderyng there is other tymes nothynge more holsome for mannes bodye: and they say, that they can nat perceyue, howe any hurte shulde comme therof in this disease. The whiche commeth all together of the

corruption and putrifaction of the bloode, seinge onely salte moste of all thynges preserueth and defendeth from both these. And more ouer the nature of salt is to make fast and drye vppe, to bynde and clense: whiche proprete were thought moste metest and necessary to be ministred, to plucke vppe this disease by the rotes. Fyrste bycause the bodye infected with the pockes, is loosed and shaken: secondly bycause the humours procede and flowe out from one mater: Thirdly, whiche is the chiefe poynt of al, bicause the corrupt and infecte bloode is yet within the bodye vnpourged. For this syckenesse is no other thynge / than a certayne order & state of the body changed through the trouble of the bloode: Euen as it hapneth in a cytie, whan a sedition & partakynge entreth into a commen welthe, and the cōmen people be moued in theyr myndes: than are all thynges skattered abrode withoute order, and moued out of theyr places, nothynge hangeth to gether, nothynge standeth, nothynge abydeth, no quietnes, no peace, but all ful of trouble, vnto the whiche chaunge of the body, motion of membres, and shakynge of ioyntes, with all suche troubles, there muste come some sadde and wyse father,

a man of hygh auctoritie in the comen welth: for his godlynes and good deseruynges towarde all men (who as Virgyll sayth) maye gouerne and rule with wordes theyr hartes / and quiete theyr stomakes. So in lyke maner is it in salte / whiche as I sayde, through fastnyng, dryinge, bynding, and purgynge / dothe put to quietnes thynges, that are moued, dothe vnite and knytte thynges that are broken, doth bynde to gether thynges that are plucked aparte, doth make caulme and quiete thynges, that are troubled: and bryngeth quietnes and sauegarde vnto all thynges: yea howe greatte a thynge and howe necessarie thoughte Plinie salte to be, sayinge without salte a mans life can not indure? And therfore say they, how can that hurte in this syckenes / whiche in other diseases conserueth all thynges? And for as moche as in this cure we muste take hede, that no corrupt humours be abundāt, and salte resolueth and clenseth all fylthye moystnes / and also kepeth down and restrayneth the flowynge of the body: it is thought we shulde be more plentuous of salte herein than els where. Not withstandynge these reasons / we muste haue an other consideration herein. And fyrste of all as moche as

appertaynethe vnto this disease, howe the sycke muste forbeare salte meates, not all maner, but onely suche as are very sharpe: Lette it be asked of the phisitions, whiche haue longe before tyme prosecuted that matter to the vttermost: for this tyme, seynge the medicine of Guaiacum is specyally intreated of, we may say, that though al phisitions knowe the vse of salte, excepte it be very lyttell, to be noyous and hurtfull in all other passions of the synewes, and in suche diseases as sprynge of corrupte bloode, and of yelowe and blacke colour, or salte fleume, for so moche as with his tartnes, it sharpeneth coler, and burneth the bloudde, and with his na

               iue dryenes causeth the humours and nutrimēt of the body to dry vp, and by that meanes distroyeth all thynges, that shulde helpe vnto helthe. Yet neuer the lesse aboute the administration of Guaiacum they forbede vtterly all maner vse of salt, for the same consyderation they forbede all sharpe thynges, and moreouer all thynges penetratiue: and amonges these, spices, and wyne. For so moche as all suche through theyr sharpenes and persynge power, do open all poores and entreyes / and go depe: whiche violence runnyng through the body,

cum can haue no place to worke. If these resons do not satisfie those mens myndes / I wyll saye vnto them, as the philosophers saye of the stone Magnes, if it be anoynted with garlycke, it draweth not yron to hit, so lykewyse Guaiacum hath a certayne secret vertue / and can n

               t tell whither it be as yet knowen, to abhorre specially the vse of salt, and whiche power is loste if salte ones come vnto it. And this haue we spoken of the forbearynge of salte in this cure. Nowe wylle we speake of the sklender fedynge and hunger, wherwith the body muste be weakened and made leane, whervppon all the matter of this dyete hangeth.
         
         
            ¶Of sklender fedynge, and hūger, necessary in this cure. Ca. xvij.
            ALthough we spake before of the smalle and thyn fedynge, that the sycke muste vse, and how his meat must be diminished, & he brought to hunger / yet we thynke it very necessary to warne you ones agayne of the same thynge, in this place: not onely bicause

this medicine requyreth a voyde and an emptye bodye / from all maner fulnes / but also bycause I wolde declare / t
                  •
               at in olde tyme the
                  •
               e was a lyke maner to cure the like. And we may also rede in Diodoro, that the Egiptians dydde heale theyr sycke other with fastynge or els with vomyt. For they affirme, as he recyteth / that sycknesses are ingendred specially of the superfluite of meate: And therfore they thought that way of curynge to make moste vnto helthe / that taketh awaye the fyrste causes of the disease. Let not therfore these dronkerdes, these intemperate felowes, gyuen to surfetynge / be greued with this dyete, whiche as Persius sayth, delyteth only in delitious fedynge, and may lyue scantely halfe a daye without meate: whose bealy as the prophet saythe, is their god, and all theyr mynde and lyfe is nothynge but fedynge. Let suche felowes, as I sayde, ceasse theyr grudging against this dyete / seynge that therby so excellent and so good a thyng is obteyned, and so great an euyll is auoyded with so lyttell labour. And let them not than in this thing speake of the great ieoperdye, whiche maye comme of weakenes, through longe abstinence: as who saith, that he may faynt, that

eateth after this maner. For Plinie saithe, that none dyeth for lacke of meate before the .vii. day: and may continue vntyl the .xi. day. And al be it he wryteth, that in his time there was a woman in Germani, which lyued sometyme full twentye dayes withoute meate: and sometyme .xxx. And that he sawe a man, whiche continued .vij. weakes without meate, drynkyng euery seconde day onely water. Plinie also sayth, that he knoweth for a suretie / that the Scythians hauynge certayne herbes in theyr mouthes, abyde hūger & thyrst somtyme .xij. days. And some also say, that the christen philosopher Amonius / neuer eate but only tosted bread / whiche thynge if any man greatly meruaile at, lette hym remembre / that this is also wrytten in the storyes, that certayne of the mages lyued ones by meale and herbes only. And that Diodore writeth, that the olde Egiptians meate was herbes and rotes. And Hesiodus monyssheth / saying, we shuld lyue & eate Malus & asphodelo. And Plato writynge of the lawes maketh mention, that Epimenides was contented sometyme so to lyue. If any man wyl set these thinges before his eies, & cōsider thē, thā shal he perceiue, yt we liue very deinteously in this diete

and do take in a maner more than nedeth. But if it were a very harde thynge to absteyne so from meate, what is he that loueth hym selfe so lytell, but he wolde to get his helthe, suffer this griefe? or that hadde not leuer suffer .xxx. dayes hunger, than to be s
                  •
               cke as longe as he lyueth? or had nat leuer passe ouer so many dayes with stronger hunger / that he may lyue the resydue of his lyfe holle and sounde of bodye / than to auoyde this lyttell griefe, and to be tourmented all the dayes of his lyfe with intollerable sorowes, and to haue runnynge frome hym stynkynge and fylthye matter? I haue tolde you: that this is no new maner of curynge: for alwayes the best phisitions haue commaunded abstinence to the sycke. Of the whiche nombre is Asclepiades, who, as Celsus saythe, wryteth, that the moste soueraygne remedy agaynste the feuer is, as he hath proued it, to diminysshe the strength of the pacient with moche watche and abstinence, in so moche that at the fyrste begynnynge of the syckenes, they shulde not so moche as wasshe theyr mouthe.
            ¶Abstinence, sayth Eusebius, both kepeth the bodyly helthe / and the shamefastnes of mynde. Wherby it appereth, that lyttel and

perate fedynge is profytable to the flesshe and the soule, as wytnesseth Timotheus, whiche being on a season with Plato at supper, hauynge before hym suche meate as he was wonte to haue / tourned towarde his frendes & sayd: They that Plato receiueth to souper, shall be well at ease longe after, meanynge that after moche eatynge of dyuers and aboundant costly dysshes, deynteously dressed, there folowed euyll and rawe digestion, and greatte grefe of the stomake. Wherfore afterwarde whan it chaunced him to mete with Plato, he sayde vnto hym: Ye Plato do ete this day rather for to morowe than for the tyme present.

Why (quod the gentylman) are ye sycke? Naye (quod the abbotte) I am not sycke, but I haue no maner appetite vnto my meate. I go ther

that thou gyue me a rewarde for my medicine, and made hym pay .ii. hōdred crownes / and sente hym awaye in good helthe, with suche an appetite, that he coude haue eaten both beanes and lekes: where as before he refused all maner meate / were it neuer so deyntie: And so was he well ordered / seing he sought not mete with hunger, but hunger with meate. But paraduenture we haue spoken more than ynough of this thynge: therfore lette vs go vnto other matters: But fyrste I muste telle you (to make an ende of this chapiter) that Guaiacum requireth not a bealy that is replenysshed with varietie of meates, or troubled with wynde in the inward partes / but purified and clensed from all rawnes and grosnes of humours.
         
         
            ¶Howe hunger may easely be suffred. Capit. xviij.
            ANd this scarsenes of mete can nat onely be borne, but also maye easely be borne, and that through the vertue of Guaiacum: whiche after the bodye is ones brought downe, doth bothe preserue the life

and also causeth that the sycke shal not nede to eate any thynge at all. Therfore dydde I not without a cause gyue warnynge, that the syck shulde absteyne from meate as moche as may be. And if he wax feble or faint, he may not be holpen with meate, but with the swete sa

Whiche thynge howe it shulde chaunce in any manne, I can not telle: for in me there happened no suche thynge at all, that I neded any maner help: Than I wolde counsayle hym to vse these thynges, whiche Plinie thynketh easeth hunger, and quencheth thyrste, whan they be very fy

Gellius sayth, that Erastrate dydde write / that the Scythians / whan they for somme cause muste nedes suffer hunger, do thruste together their bely and binde it round about very straitly with brode

               wadlyng bondes, thynkyng that by suche pressynge to gether of theyr bealy, hunger may be putte away / or the easelyer borne. For seing, as he saith, hunger cometh of emptynes, and is caused of the voydnes and holownesse of the intrayles / and of the bealy, than whan the bealy is gyrde in harde, so that the emptynes is fylled / & the holownes ioyned, there can be no hunger where as these thynges be not, and vtterlye forbearynge of meate / may lightly be born. But why say I, vtterly forbearynge of meate / whiche can not be in this cure? I may wel calle it honger / what so euer it be, that any abydeth. For it maye be suffred well and easely / though a manne take nothynge in the worlde to helpe it. But vnto these deynteous sycke persones what thynge can be lyght? whiche can not onely suffer no hunger, but also not to haue a stomake vnto meate, they thynke it intollerable. For the whiche if at any tyme they be sycke, we mought praye god, that they neuer recouer / consyderynge they esteme hit a

greatte grefe to bye helthe with a lyttell sufferynge.
            ¶Of these maner persones if I speke some what largely, I do it after myn accustomed maner, specially whan I perceyue many of my countrey men the Almaynes, to erre in this behalfe.
         
         
            ¶The prayse of temperaunce in spite of ryotte. Capit. xix.
            BVt I beseche almyghty god / that this nation maye ones knowe it selfe. Whiche thyng I do not desyre so moche, bicause it is vncomely, that the people that rulethe all the worlde, shulde so lyue, as for that, that suche intemperancie and ryotte is an occasyon to vs of great euyls, and also to be greatly dispised. If other people shulde eate and drynke as moche as they coude, they thinke they shulde passe the lawe of nature: but whan we cromme in so moche / that we can nat beare it, we loke after laude and prayse. What meneth these stryues and contentions of our valyant drynkers? Whanne he that

drynketh is receyued with triumphe, whan it is glorye to ouercome in drynkynge, and no shame to be dronke and cast it vp agayn. O countray, o empire. As for the Poloniās, or if there be any other that passethe vs in dronkennes, I regarde them not, but this nation I say ought to remembre them selfe, and haue regarde to theyr dignitie: excepte it seme, that other nations are comen vnder this em

               ire, not for the reuerence and opinion, whiche they hadde of our noble forefaders, but to dispise and mocke vs. Verily it muste nedes be, that they were far other men / that had such honour gyuen vnto them than we be, that are thus dispised. Is there so moche as a chylde in Italy, that knoweth vs by any other name, than by the name of dronkerdes? Seinge that thanne other strāge nations do speake sooner of our vice than of our humanitie or vertue: shall

Or shall we not thynke / that it is more shame to vs to lose the tytle and profyte of the empire, that hath ben a glorye to receyue, whan it was offered vnto vs? Or that sober men and reasonable wylle be content to be vnder the rule and dominiō

               tte vs at the leste wyse haue so moche wytte as to care for our bodely helth, whiche must nedes be troubled and brought to naught in suche festynges, surfetynges, and drinkynges: about the whiche, as the satirike poete sayth, leapethe and skyppeth in greatte companies of al kindes of diseses. But Germanie hathe loste his wytte and vnderstondynge, and hath forgotten it selfe, not all Germanie, but many in Germanie. These be they that drawe their dyners vnto soupper, and theyr suppers in to farre nyghte. These be they, whiche through theyr mysorder, haue caused a straunge poete, but yet nat an ylle poete / for he semeth to hate yl men, to write to the greatte sclaunder of this countreye / sayinge: Bacchus sytteth at the deyse, And Appollo is caste out of all company. For al the lyfe there is nothynge els but drinkyng,

that is, they set more by drynkynge than by wysedome. Howe be it these dronkerdes / that erre throughe madnes and lyghtnes, mought lyghtly be dispised: but these that with theyr deynteous fare, and nyce and wanton apparell cast them selfe heedlonge into the mydmayne see of voluptuousnesse and pleasures. These I saye, be worthy to be hated of all the worlde. These be they, that lye vpon theyr pyllowes of downe heped to gether, that consume what so euer may be gotten by lande or see, not to susteyn theyr lyfe, but to delyght their swete

               outhes, that muste weare the fyneste lynnen, that muste be robed in purple, that reioyse, to be wrapped in softe myes skynnes, not so moche to kepe them from colde, as for delicacie and wantonnes. These be they, that may not touche commen clothe, whose skyn can nat suffer but the fynest and softest thing that may be gotten: that take theyr counsel in quaffynge and in theyr counsels quaffe, that meddle with no sadde matters, but lede all theyr lyfe in feastynges.
            ¶These thinges ar not vsed (I say ageyn) through all Germanie / but specially, which thynge is to our great shame and rebuke, amonge the chiefe and the nobles of Germanie:

whiche pamperde vp dayly with all maner deyntie fare, exercisynge dyners and suppers meate for popes, in them they bankette, in them they brynge one to an other, and therin haue suche pleasure / that they had leuer dye, than to be plucked from hit. They haue none other care, but to fylle the bealy: by whom Salust if he had suspected such bestes euer to com in Germanie, might well haue spoken this his sayenge: Many men gyuen to fedynge and slepynge, haue passed euen as straungers theyr holle lyfe, without knowlege and lernynge. But let a man caste with hym selfe what opinion the Romaynes had in these dayes of the people of Germanie: and thanne sette before his eies, what a monster, and howe ha

                  •
                nor knowlege our fant, but do accuse god of crueltie. And thoughe hit be we our selfe, that gette and bye with great cost and expenses the sedes of all our syckenes / and norysshe with all oure harte our owne

mischiefe and distruction / cherysshynge our euyls with the lost of our holle patrimonie: yet whan we be ones downe / and sette vppe with quosshens and pyllowes heped rounde aboute vs, not able to moue hand nor fote: than we blame nature, and saye, we maye thanke god of all our euyls and peynes. For no glottons do otherwyse, than they dydde, whiche Iuuenall speaketh of, whiche beleue, that god in his fume and wrathe dothe cast these diseases vpon theyr bodies: and therfore calle them the gonne stoones and weapons of god. But wolde to god we wold returne to our oten porage, and be couered as we were in tyme paste, with wollē garmentes, so made that euery lymme and part of vs mought be sene, & to waxe wery of this sylke, & hate these garmentes so full of playtes. For what other thynges are all these, but fyrste the wastynge of our patrimonie, and than the purchasyng and incresse of all euylles and diseases? Verily our ancetours / beynge verye nyggardes in this thynges, dydde great actes and excellent thynges with hyghe glorye. But whan dyd we, that to fulfyll our pleasant affection receyue venom in the stede of meate / any thing worthye the honour and glorye of Germanie?

It was farre better for vs to be called and counted barbarous, whan our lyuynge was homely and rude, than nowe to haue in this ryottous lyfe, and this shame / the laude and prayse of wyttes and good lernynge.
            ¶What wolde great Charles say nowe, if he came agayn to vs, and saw our princis in theyr vtter garmentes of sylke: seinge that he hym selfe wore a shert of habergyn? Or what wolde one of the Othons say, whiche stretched out and enlarged theyr vertue and valyantnes in duste and durte

                whan oure men anoynte them selfe with straunge and costly bawmes?
            ¶There is a notable execration of Chrysyppus agaynst them, that vse oyntmentes voluptuously to the pleasure of other. The deuyll take these delycate felowes, saythe he, that haue sclaundered so good a thyng: the people that were wanton and gyuen to pleasure vsed it in tymes paste. But it was neuer thought / that the Germayns shulde euer come to this poynt, to smell of oyntmentes and bawmes. And nowe we cal for pomāders, muskeballes, dam

               ske pouders, and all maner sauers / as thynges necessary to our lyfe: and thynke it greate honour to vs to smelle of suche strange sauours. Nother

is hit women only that are in this faut, but men, specially princis and priestes.
            ¶Solon forbade oyntmentes to be solde in a cite of Grece: And the Lacedemones expelled them from theyr citie, sayinge: that they corrupted and marred theyr oyle.
            ¶And Lycurgus toke away from the same Lacedemones bankettynge, feastynge, and costely dyners. And Socrates (as Xenophon saythe) dydde grenously rebuke suche ryottous abundance.
            ¶Truely the olde Germayns mynded no such voluptuous plesures, and they thought it a very straunge thynge / to lyue any thing wantonly or nycely. I haue hard some olde men say / that whan they were yonge men, it was a suspecte thynge to weare a gowne: whan we now a dayes do honour and worshyppe purpull. And therfore we may well crye, O corrupted and wretched worlde. They were couered with the skynnes of wylde beastes, and laye in their feldes vnder the skye / and were made stronger with contynnall labour, where we that be wantonly and nycely clothed, and take our plesure vnder oure gaye gylted houses, be through all kyndes of ryotte and voluptuous pastymes vtterly weaked, and of all

manly strēgthes depriued. And may any mā thynk, that this maner of lyuing can lightly haue an ende, seing the chiefe & principal exā
               ple therof cometh fro them specially, that be called prestes? What they be in dede god knoweth, and they onely / to whom it hath pleased god to gyue trewer eyes to se with. These do not vse al maner pompes and excesses in thinges appertainyng vnto the seruice of god, but euerye one of them muste swymme at home in his house in all maner of costly and deynteous dyshes and cuppes, and they calle eatynge and drynkynge lyuynge: or if they do not so call it, yet verily they so esteme it. And therfore seing they do soo, other menne thynke they maye doo the same.
            ¶And this the laudable and naturalle custome and fascion of Germanie is banisshed. For we be so farre gone, that we excede all other nations, be they neuer so euyll, in suche abundaunce and voluptuous pleasures. It had more becommed vs to haue dryuen these thynges out from the myddes of vs, and as Diogenes dydde to the Tartis and fyne manchettis / so to haue sayde to this straunge ryottous maner: O gueste go and gette the hens quickely. Ye the examples of

straunge nations ought ones to haue taught vs. And seinge to bankette and surfet most largely is nowe adaye counted moste kyngly, why do we not here the answere of Menedemus the philosopher, whiche he made to Antigonus, askyng hym whither he shuld go to a deynteous and costely f

The wordes also of saynt Paule ought to be writen in our hartes, sayinge: Meates are gyuen to the bealy, and the bealy to meates: but god shall make an ende of bothe.

But they nowe do the same thynges, whiche ought to be our gides into the kyngdome of god / priestes, chanons, bysshoppes, and prelates, in so moche, that it is nowe come into a prouerbe through out all Germanie:

               e. If we wyll please and delite our taste, or as though the great price of our garmentes dyd increase the qualities of the mynde. But I wyll ceasse to speake more of this man, leest I shulde seme to couet myn owne glory. If I had fyrst told you this one thing me thynketh it is not so goodly a thynge to be borne of this my stocke and familye, in

the whiche be somme causes besydes this, wherof I maye glorie, as to be borne his neuewe, that thus hath lyued. Our predecessours, and suche as I my selfe haue sene olde men, whan I was but a chylde / whan they dyd kepe, in their mete, drynke / and clothyng suche temperance, they were of good lykynge of body, and through great labour were hardned agaynst hunger and thurste, heate and colde, where as we at the fyrste frost, sheuer and shrinke together both hand & fote: & as sone as wynter beginneth we be treble furred, and be shut vp in our hot houses, out of the which we go not vntyl mydsommer / whan the sonne & heate bourneth and parcheth all thynges. And as I saye, where as nowe scantly the .x. person of the noble men can be founde in Germania, but he hathe eyther the gowte in his fete, or in his handes, or is greued with the dropsye, sciatica, or lepry, or is tourmented with this frenche euyll, whiche bryngeth these greattest euyls with hym.
            ¶But at the last let vs retorne & enter into that lyfe, whiche is metest for this nation & empire of Germanie, and which euen they, whome I tolde you lyued wantonly, can be well contented to here praised. For I thinke there is not one of these, that gyue them

selfe to suche delycate & ryottous lyfe, but he hateth the same in other, excepte he be so blynded through intēperancie, that he loueth these vnthryftie manered Sardanapales, and Heliogabalos, or dothe hate the persimonia of many, whiche be of the contrary facion. Truly vertue semeth very amiable euen to them that dothe lyttell folowe or regarde hit.
            ¶ It was an olde meate of Catos, poradge made with chese and egges. And Plinie rehersethe, that gruelle made with otemelle grootes was ones the meate of the verye and true Germaynes, as it is yet of many vnto this daye. But we fede vppon straunge and beyonde see victuals, thynkynge that we haue so moche nede of them, that euerye house holder hathe decreed to selle these thynges, that growe with vs, to bye the other with: whiche one thynge hathe enryched the Fuchers: whiche in the meane season, that we thus nouryshe our bodies, haue all the money, and lyke wyse all the excellent goodly places in Almayne. For they beinge the ministers of our voluptuous lyuing, are so increased, that there is no prince in Almayne able to compare with them in ryches. So farre be we gone, and so lyttell

perceyue we, what thynges Germanie deuoureth and consumeth. Wherfore I thynke that he was of excellent wysedome (if any suche was) that feared in tymes passed, leste suche voluptuous and delycate lyfe shulde enter into Germanie: wherof (as euery mā may playnly see) spryngeth so moche pestylence, and so many diseases: and ageyn perceyued, that they shulde lyue quietly / that coulde be contented to lacke suche pleasures and delyciousnes. For they that dresse oure herbes, & lyue with them (as there be some trewe Germaynes yet remaynynge) they are of good helth and bodily lykynge: but they that be spyce fyngered, and belche synamom, and smelle all of cloues, and haue all theyr pleasure in goodly araye, these be they, that are subiectes to all kyndes of diseases and euyls. Howe properly therfore dydde the Satirike Poete calle the gowte Ryche? For it medleth not with them that are poore, and drynke no wyne, but hit is a companion for ryche men, dronkerdes, surfetours and delycate lyuers: which (as the same poete sayth) to gette swete morsels, leue no place vnserched.
            ¶And so, thoughe this countreye brynge forth that that is necessarye for the lyfe, yet

as though nature had vtterly forsakē them, they ron vnto strāge thinges, fetchyng their garmētes, theyr meatis & medicines frō Hercules pyllers, from the ilonde of Taprobana, from the ryuer of Ganges, and frome places farther of than these, euen almooste from the heed of Nilus.
            ¶The wrathe of god lyghte on these deed mens heedes, ye fyrst receyued these euyls in to Germanie. For they haue done a thynge vnworthy for the grauite of the Germains Truely they, oure forefathers, were none suche: the which preferred the labours and peins of Hercules aboue the flesshely lustes, aboue the delycate meatis and softe beddes of Sardanapalus. But O lorde Chryste, howe delycate, howe holsomme fedynge is breadde made of rye or whete, and gruelle made of millio, oriza, ptisana, and otemele porage? Adde thervnto so many kyndes of herbes, and so many dyuers garden spyces, as anyse, coryandre, cynomum, fenell, musterde, neppe, oynions, lekes, garlyke, and specially if we wyll beleue Plinie, persley hath a singular good grace, to season meates with. And for drynke we haue ale and biere. And for the ryche men there is wyne, whiche is the pure and cleane drynke of the

erthe, as Appollonius iudgeth: so that it be vsed scarsly, whether it grewe in France, or vpon the bankes of Rhenus. We haue also of our owne beestes flesshe bothe tame and wylde, whiche are not of vnpleasant taste. We haue fruites of trees, not to be dispised, howe ryche is Germanie, howe plenteous of all meates, howe abundantly dothe hit ministre all thynges necessary for the lyfe of man? Wherfore my chiefe desyre & vowe is, that they neuer lacke the gowte, nor the frenche pockes: that can nat lyue without pepper: And I pray god / they may ones be brought to extreme hunger, whiche nowe serche in all places, not for meate to lyue with: but for delycates and deintees, wherwith they may stere vp their swete mouthes and prouoke theyr appetites. Howe iustely dyd Galenus enuie helth to suche felowes, whā he forbode al phisitiōs from the curing of dronkerdes, & of them that are gyuen to the bealy? If such at any tyme were sycke, for they by and by (sayth he) throughe intemperate lyuynge hepe vppe agayne gros
                  •
               e and vndigested humours, so that they be clensed and purged in vayne.
            ¶The necessite of nature is lyghtly contented, sayth Hierom. Colde may be expelled

with course clothynge, and hunger with lytell meate.
            ¶ Whan Anaxerses the kynge of Perse was brought to that necessite, that he eate drye fygges and barly breade, than he beholdynge his fortune, and suche a greatte chaunge, sayde: O what pleasure is this / that my regall abundaunce kepte me from? By the whiche example we may know, that they onely lyue in knowlege of theyr owne lyfe that lyue scarsely and soberly: And on the other syde, they that be gyuen to the norysshynge of theyr bodyes, and the pouryng in of all thinges, be as men erryng in darkenes, and perceyue not theyr owne lyfe, so farre are they from the lyfe of pleasure. Howe be it within short space, whan they be ones fallen into diseases, than they begynne to fele and perceyue, what lyfe they haue chosen, and what is the reward of the same. For as Persius sayth, whan the harde and stony goute, the braunches of their olde surfetynge, hath broken their ioyntes: than they mourne, that they haue passed theyr dayes so grossely, and consumed theyr lyfe so fylthely, and be so sorye to late of theyr lyfe to comme.

all the syckenes, that the Germayne haue? seing we may yet remembre, that this pestilence and mischiefe of the bodye dyd enter with that ranke and riottous lyfe. For here we do nowe so gyue our selfes to whores & pleasures, that we seme to stryue with other straunge people for the maystry of fylthye lyuynge, as menne do in games for the beste wager. And for this purpose we haue certayne ministers very experte. These gette and conueye vnto vs from the fardest partes of the worlde prouocations of glotony. These brynge in from farre, with meruaylous delyght / both to eate, to drynk / & also to clothe our selfes with. Wherin seing they haue longe and many dayes contynued, to theyr owne (as I sayde) great aduantage: they haue made some so delicious, that whā they be here in Almayne, they muste drynke wyne of Corse, they must haue meates out from Italie: and contrary wyse, whan they be at Rome, they vse wyne of Rhene, or that whiche Neccarius bryngeth forthe. O peruersed custome of lyuynge. O myschieffe / worthy to be hated of all men: euen so moche the more that they be bysshoppes / whiche do these thynges, and are the rynge leaders thervnto.

            ¶Aristophanes reproueth the tables of the Syracusanes, and the voluptuous aboundāce of the Sibarites. If at that time he blamed suche thinges, what wolde he say, if he nowe lyued / aud sawe our bankettynge and feastynge, our quaffynge and drynkynge? Therfore as many as coueyte vertue and knowledge, lette them take hede and harken to Pythagoras, whiche saythe: that a man, that ryseth aboue man, can nat tast or atteyne any hygh thynge, that is to say, as longe as a man lyueth vnchastely and dissolutely, he shall neuer do any great thynge with wytte or mynde. The moste holsomest fedynge for man (sayth Plinie) is one maner meate, the heapynge of dyuers tastes is pestiferous, and sawces are worse than that.
            ¶Persius well perceyued these thynges whan he thus spake in great mode: Thou woldest haue lyttie ioyntes, and a hole bodye in age. Ye but the full dysshes, and the fatte denteous, wyll not suffer the goddes nor Iupiter to graunt thervnto.
            ¶And Cicero bryngeth in Cato saying: that a libidinous and intemperate youthe, maketh

age very feble. And he aduyseth and counsayleth vs to eate & drink so moch as may susteyne the bodyly strength, & not oppresse it, thynkyng that nothing can be so vnfrendely vnto the mynde of man, whiche he callethe an heuenly reward and gyft, as voluptuousnes is. Nor as longe as luste and pleasure bereth rule, Temperance can haue no place: Neither vertue may beare any stroke, where luste and pleasure reigneth. And therfore he iudgeth, that we ought to gyue great thankes vnto age, whiche causeth that we lyste not to do that thynge, whiche we ought not. For voluptuousnes, sayth he, beinge an ennemye vnto reason, stoppeth and letteth all good counsel, and blyndeth the eyes of the mynde, and medleth nothyng at all with vertue. And therfore he thinketh, that olde men are happy, whiche whan they lacke feastes, full dysshes, and the cuppes ofte walkynge, they lacke also dronkennes, rawnes of stomacke, and be not combred nor vexed with dreames, whiche maner of thynges, accompany them that are gyuen to suche wantonnes. For Hierom sayth, that diseses come of to moche eatynge.

The same Ioseph preyseth the continēcie of the Phariseis. He that wolde ones haue hadde vs distroyed, I thynke hath desyred / that this custome of liuyng

Or if there be any vse therof amonge other nations, I pray god that this nation neuer knowe it, or se it. And Christe sende our countrey men this mynde, that they may call home agayne the frugalite of their elders, & facion them selfes to their honest sparynge.

Socrates hatyng the tauerne haunters, and such as haue al theyr delyte and pleasure in theyr throtes, sayd: Many men lyue to the intente to eate and drinke, but I eate and drynke to lyue.

They say, that a syke man may be recouered only

by this dyete and order of lyfe, whiche is prescribed in this cure of Guaiacū, though he neuer drinke of this decoction of Guaiacum, nother receyue any other medicine. And I my selfe haue sene them, that haue promysed, that they wolde sethe the shauynges of Iuniper, and of oke, or asshe, or pine tree, or al these together, and they douted nat, but that they wold with these helpe men of suche diseases, as well as with this decoction of Guaiacum. Where vnto (all thoughe I suspecte theyr malicious intent) yet I pray god sende them as good fortune as they wolde wysshe. For what coude be a greater commodite vnto this nation, than to haue such a remedy growyng in our own woddes / which must els be fet from so far? But I greatly feare, leste they go in vayne about this their rashe promise, both bycause I thynke this to be a greuouser disease than may be put away with hunger, without any other medicine ministred, specially after it hath fastned his rootes depely, as for the most part it is wont to do. And also if these trees, whiche I spake of, coude do any suche thinge, theyr vertue and power I thinke shuld not so longe haue gone vnknowen, seinge they growe here amonge vs. Neuer

For what other thynge hath a phisition to do, but dayly to fynde out somewhat / and to knowe by experience, and to serche what wyll helpe euery griefe and sickenes? But this thynge I wolde all shulde be admonished to beleue / wherof I spake before / that the helpe of frugalite and scarsenes, as hit is great in other diseases, so is it, and that specially, in the frenche pockes: but yet not so great that it may amende the bloude that is infected and corrupted throughe the venome of this disease, without suche medecines, as haue their power & strēgth to do it. As by example. If two kepte warre together, and the one of them obteyned of me / that I shulde not helpe his aduersarie: veryly I may impute vnto hym, that I hurte hym not / but that I haue holpe hym, I may in no wyse. And lykewyse the absteynynge from meate and drinke, as it doth nat take away the disease, so dothe it not norysshe. As one myght say, that he nother bounde a persone whan he myght, nother losed hym whan he might not.

For that entreth so depe that it can not lightly be plucked vp, & spredeth so brode / that it can not with a lyttell thynge be brought to gyther, but it so infecteth the hole body, on which it ones catcheth hold, that it can nat be taken from any part alone / but whan it is dryuen oute from the hole, as at one brayd or plucke. Beleue me, that haue proued many thynges herein to my great hurte, if any man moughte haue auoyded this euyll with sobre and scarse liuyng / I had auoyded it longe syns. For by the space of .iii. hole yeres I kept my body as lowe and as leane as coulde be / in so moche that in that space I felt no grefe of my disease, but yet I was not cleane rydde from it. Never the lesse go to ye noble promysers / sethe ye asshe / make ye redy Iuniper and pyne tree, and take boxe to, if hit please you, and horne beame, and plane tree, and ye shall gette ryght great thanke of all men, if throughe your diligence we may haue here at home, that we muste elles seke so farre of.

               oydeth very lyttell and harde, and that with moche ado, and that is not onely by cause he eateth litel but also by cause the nature of this medycine is to dry & bynde. How be it I haue harde say, that this thynge hapneth nat to euery man a lyke. For some say that anone after the begynnynge they were lose belyed, and some were so continually: Whereof I did meruayle. For in these .xl. dayes it neuer wente from me so moche as ones, but as it was compelled. For in this diete it may be kepte to the .v. or .vi. day. without any ieoperdie: And than in the mornyng

the shauynge of this Guaiacum soden in water must be dronken to the mayntenaunce of halfe an vnce. And if it moue not at the fyrst, it must be geuen agayn the next day, & so the thirde day, and if it help nat, so ye muste than poure in clysters vndernethe or suppositoryes prepared for ye nones. For the bely muste nedes be losed. And if a man wyll lose hym selfe by drynkynge or eating Cassia, I thynke he dothe not moche amisse so that this be done but ones, and that mornynge lette hym not drynke Guaiacum: I wolde not that he shulde be eased with vomitis: for they make the bodye colde: and (as Plinie sayth) they be euyll for the eyes, and speciallly for the tethe. There be many thynges in this cure, that stoppe the bealy. Fyrst bycause the body is emptied in the begynnynge with a pourgation, and than bycause there is lyttell meate receyued. But as this place is closed and shut from eiections, so is there somewhat in the meane season, other by sweatynge, through the strengthe of Guaiacum that expelleth thynges hurtfull and superfluous, or els in the vrine, the whiche is more moyste than that cometh of the meate. And one thynge is greatly comfortable, that in the tyme of this cure there

chaunceth no swellynge / nor there are no peynfull throwes or aches felt / nor the taste cometh not bytter, nor there ryseth no lothynge of meate, nor vapours breathe not lyghtly ascendynge from the stomake to the heed, as in other diseses. And that the paciēt is pourged, it is easely perceiued by making of water: nor to the intente that shulde be done / none other prouocacyon shulde be soughte. Nowe wyll I speake a lyttell of sweatynge.

            IF the pacient can not sweat, somme thynke, that meanes shulde be sought to prouoke hym therto. And therfore they caste on hym many elothes, and lette hym lye thre or foure houres couered hotte. And though this amonge all thynges that we suffre, be one the hardeste: yet I felte euen to the very feyntynge, that so chanceth no fayllynge, all they that were cured with me, indured it moste greuously, and they sayde, that this

            ¶And I thynke verily, that as well in this cure as in other, the phisitions of my countrey do many thynges fondly, whiche ought not to be done. For as this medicine of hit selfe causeth one to sweate, euen so hit wyll not abyde compulsion. Wherof this may be a dewe profe, that I perceyued my selfe no sooner to sweate, whanne I was couered with thre or foure furres, than whan I had to wrye me but one couerlede. But this I wold ye shuld vnderstande, that the pacient muste nedes sweate, and if it wyll not come naturally, than it must be prouoked meanly. For I allowe nothynge that is forced.

therof, made it smaller than they shuld haue done, I was the longer er it wrought on me. And I haue harde physitions say, that according to the cōplexiō of the bodies it worketh sooner and slowlyer. And this is sure and certayne, whiche thynge Stromer ofte affirmed vnto me, that if they, the whose wyt is more subtyle, and are ryghte attentiuely g
                  •
               uen vnto studye / happe to falle sycke / theyr diseases shall be more vehement and longer continue. And many thynke, that it skylleth greatly, as well in this disease / as other, in what placis of the body the syckenes shulde chaunce, for the ryghte parte is more healeable than the left: Bycause, saith Alexander, by larger exercyse the matter is stopped, and made more apte to heale. Also they saye, it is more harder to heale the vttermoste partis, bycause they be farre of from the bodye, it is longe er they can be nourysshed and fedde. And there it is to be taken hede, whether the grefe doth ascende or discende. Celsus sayth, that what so euer grefe gothe downewarde, is the more curable. And agayne. All grefe, whiche procedeth vpwarde, is worse for the medicyne to come vnto. And that suche diseases, that chaunce in our secrete partis / as they are

moste peynefull and sharpe, by reason of inflamation (whervnto those partis are specially subiectes) so are they forthewith and soonest healed. Whiche as in all other medicines they maye be moued, so for the newe vse brought vp of Guaiacum, I wote not whether it be alway so or no. But this lette euery man take hede of, that where so euer the grefe be, and with what so euer kynde of the pockes they be peyned, that they prepare well Guaiacum / and after they haue dronke so long therof that it be spredde and rounne into the veynes: thanne ye maye be sure theyr ache lytell and lytell goth away: And otherwhyle the ache commeth agayne / and is more sharpe and peynefull: and goth away agayne. For after it ones begynneth to swage, and than waxeth soore and peynfull, it endureth not longe. And they that haue soores, shall haue the flesshe eaten away about the soores of a greatte breadth: And that is a token, they begynne to heale. For vnto me it chāced, as it neuer did afore, that about the .xxv. daye my legges weare eaten so bare, that ye myghte haue sene the bone the breadth of a mannes nayle, whiche thynge putte me in great feare: but without any difficultie, within a fewe days after

the flesshe grewe and was restored agayne. And by this I perceyue well, that the nature of this medicine is to purifie & clense the soores vndernethe, and vnder the fleshe to proue and shewe fyrste the vertue therof. Hytherto haue I sene fewe or none, whose soores were cleane healed, that were kepte close tyll they helde. And therfore I haue harde many experte therin saye, that than Guaiacum maketh an ende of his operation, whan the pacient returneth to his meate and in euery thynge taketh agayne his olde custome of lyuynge. I tolde you before / that it was necessary for me to kepe in, tyll the .xl. daye. All thynges welle pondered / I perceyue, that this medicine requyrethe a longe season to worke perfectely. For the nature of this medicine is not to breake, or plucke away the blondde, but by lyttell and lyttell to amende and purifie hit (in whiche blondde beinge corrupte, resteth al the force and strength of this disease) and to expelle and diuide from the body the hurtefull humours, thht are norisshementes of this disease, from some in theyr vrine and sweatynges, and from other som in theyr sieges.

               , and secondly by the passages of the vrine it purgeth: by whiche meanes it fetcheth out and voydeth marueylous foule fylthynesses. And than the handes and feete waxe meruaylous colde, in so moche that they seme to haue no heate in them at all. Wherof phisitions saye this is the cause, that than this medicine draweth the heate from the vtter partes to the inner: the whiche inward partis after they be warmed and made hotte, thā the hete spredeth it self into the vtward partis. For this, without any doubt is proued, that theyr lymmes, that be healed with Guaiacum be moste hotte. And .vi. or vij. wynters nexte folowynge my legges and fete wolde be so colde, that I coude neuer gette them warme inough, thoughe I wrapped them in neuer so many clothes: nowe they waxe so warme, that with a verye thynne hose or suche lyke garment / I putte away the colde. These thynges thus vnderstande and knowen, we muste comme to this poynt, that is, to knowe the operation of Guaiacum / and agaynst what sycknesses it helpeth.
         
         
            
            ¶What power Guaiacum is of, and what sycknesses it helpeth. Cap. xxiiii.
            THe mooste principall and the chieffest effecte of Guaiacum is to hele the frēche pockes cleane / pluckyng them vppe by the rootes, but specially whan a man hath ben diseased with them of a longe tyme. For I haue sene them, that many a day laye soore peyned with the pockes, sooner and better restored vnto theyr helthe, thā they, on whom the scabbes beganne newly to appere. Not that on those, newely diseased any thynge shoulde be lefte vnhealed, but that the curynge goth forwarde more hardly, and the disease stycketh faster and is more greuously plucked out. For Guaiacum doth resolue and destroy meruaylously swellynges / getherynges to gether of yll matters, hardnesses / bumpis, and knobbes. Fluxions or runnynges it vtterly taketh awaye / eyther consumynge or tournyng the same an other way. It causeth the soores to impostume, withoute any maner of grefe. And if any thynge lye hydde within, it rooteth it oute.

And so of some (as it dyd to me) it maketh the bones bare, of some hit sheweth the synowes, and breaketh the veynes, or eateth moste depely in, and it healeth these partis that be infected with this disease, and with suche stynche and fylthynesse / that the sauoure canne not be abyden. And therfore the phisitions saye, that the vertue of this medicine is to heate, to drye, and to amende the fautis of the bloud and of the lyuer: but it worketh all these thinges with suche a temperance, that indifferently, whether the cause be hotte or colde it easeth the patientis. Wherfore with the drynes therof it restreyneth the flyxe, destroyenge the hurtfull humours that flowe oute, or els plu
                  •
               keth vp by the rootes the cause of theyr begynnynge, and restorethe agayne the good disposition of the body. It dothe extenuate fleme / and the poores or passages of the vrine, that chaunce many tymes by pervnctions to be shutte, and also other in this disease hit openeth, ye and prouoketh & compelleth the vrine to make and haue way. For the whiche skylle some thynke it helpeth them that haue the stone, and that it compelleth the stones to issue out of the bladder. I haue experience, that hit

greately minysshe blacke colere. And therfore it maketh a man more gladsome, and quencheth anger. Vndoubtedly hit hathe a greatte vertue agaynste Melancolye. And hit taketh awaye runnynges and droppynges, and it lyghtneth his heuynes, by heatynge (as it may be thought) the brayne. It is sayde, that hit amendeth soores, whiche were before yll healed, howe so euer they came, and cuttethe agayne the scarres. It amendeth the leannes, whiche hath longe contynued in the body. And therfore whan this cure is done, mē waxe very fat al their lyfe after. They saye it hath a meruaylous vertue ageynst the stynkyng of the mouth, & doth amende the griefe of the brethe, whiche also cometh through the fa

               te of an
                  •
               yntynge. It helpethe the inwarde parte
                  •
               , and specially the stomacke, the whiche hit holle reneweth, and maketh the brookynge as good as euer it was before. His effecte is excellent for the membres that be fallen awaye and diminisshed, it increaseth them and fylleth them vp, it stretcheth forth the synowes, that are shronke, and those that be loose it fastneth and maketh stronge. It is also proued, that suche partis as throughe this disease be made deed & without felyng,

are ageyne quickened and brought to theyr olde felynge and lustynesse
                  •
                I sayde before / that as touchynge the bealy it varied. For some it dydde bynde, and some it made laxe tyll they were weary. And agayne some it dyd bynde in the begynnyng, and afterward it losed them, and made them lanke belyed. And that the verye shauynges broken as small as coude be, to the mountenaunce of halfe an vnce, was gyuen in drynk to ꝓuoke a siege. I haue also sayde, that the measure therof is not gyuen after the proportion of his strength, that receyueth it. For hit maketh not one weaker whan it is mynistred. And now this one thyng I affirme, that if it be .iiii. tymes sodden, yet is not all the vertue gone out. Wherin I do not beleue other men, but I my selfe haue proued it. Howe be it I denye not, but the fyrste brothe is moche stronger. Some there are, that stedfastly beleue, that it is very good for fistuls and cankers, and for the partes that be eaten with cankers. Certayne hit is, hit helpeth them that fetche theyr wynd with pein, and can not breth, if that fault com through this sickenes, or through an oyntyng.
            ¶And for as moche as I haue shewed before, what euyls come wt this syckenes, it 
                  •
               ere but labour in vayne to repete them / 

whiche all it taketh awaye, distroyeth, and vanquyssheth, as I before tolde: and that (if they be olde) very lyghtly. And in lyke maner it helpeth the gowte. For I my selfe haue sene two restored to helth, which were sore vexed in their feete: but yet the phisitions saye, that it helpeth onely those, that haue gotten the gowte through colde, whiche thynge I leue to them to complayne of. It is also an helthefull remedy for the palsey, and especially whan it is new and lately be gonne. For than it quencheth and driueth it awaye: whiche thynge I do wryte vppon the reporte of faythfull and sadde mē, that haue knowlege therof. For as for me, I dyd neuer hytherto se any that was so delyuered.
            ¶Ricius told of a leper, the which though he were not cleane delyuered by this medicine, yet was he made moch better and cleaner, and suche a man as men myghte suffer his company: so that Ricius iudgeth, that this medicine is able to hyde and stoppe leprosye, though it can not take it clene away. But if this cure were vsed ones agayne or often, than he beleued, that the great hurte of that disease shulde be put of for a longe tyme. And more ouer he had great hope,

that if this syckenes were thus preuented in the begynnynge, it myght vtterly be purged and clensed, and the syke restored. And for as moche as this medicine hath vertue to drye vp, some go aboute to minystre hit for the water betwyxte the fleshe and the skynne, whiche is called the dropsye, the ende wherof we loke for. It is well knowen to be profytable agaynste the fallynge euyll, as the phisitions saye, if the disease be of a colde kynde. I haue sene them that were inwardely diseased and greued with manye other syckenesses, that were of an euyll and corrupted stomacke, and coulde but badly digeste, and whan they wolde recouer them selfes from theyr long feblenes and sycklynes, and repayre agayne theyr strengthe and helthe, haue prepared them selfes vnto this cure, the phisitions not aduysynge them the contrary. And Ricius approueth the same in many. For so moche as he knewe (as he sayde) that a hoole man, or but lyttell acrased, myghte come vnto this cure without any hurte: and he dyd perfectly beleue, that the good lykynge of the bodye was kepte, preserued, defended, and confirmed therwith. Let it nowe contente you, to haue harde spoken these thynges

of the helpes of Guaiacum, of the whiche if any man wyll aske me the causes, I wyll sende hym to the phisitions that be expert. For as for me, I professe no suche thyng. Neyther yet dyd I begynne this boke / to thentent that I wolde by and by gyue a reson of these thynges that I wolde wryte, but this thyng I promysed what so euer I founde of Guaiacum, and perceyued by experience, other in my selfe, or in other, and what so euer I had eyther sene or harde of other, that wolde I faythfully and truely putte in wrytynge, leauynge an occasyon to many after me, to declare the thyng as it is worthye. And nowe that all menne maye knowe, what Guaiacum hath done in me / I wyll shewe in what partes of my body, and after what fascion I was diseased.
         
         
            ¶What diseases this remedy hath taken from me. Cap. xxv.
            BY this one chaunce hit is knowen, that we ought not to dispeire in ani bodily disease; though we be brought neuer so nere to deathes dore. For howe many were

we, after the phisitions had gyuen vs vppe, that were restored to helth through the sodeine and (as a man wolde say) the heuenly helpe of Guaiacum?
            ¶I knewe one / my very sure frende / whiche whan he saw me so bytterly vexed with this siknes, that for pein I could nother rest by nyght, nother eate by day, aduysed me to kylle my selfe, seinge there coulde no remedy be founde, and my body semed to droppe awaye in fylthy matter, to my great peyne and sorowe / and no hope at all of recouerye: sayinge to me, It becommeth the to be delyuered frome this euyll, whether hit wyll or not. But he hadde forgotten, that we were christians, and remembred to wel, that we were frendes and louers. For hit is our parte to beholde all thynges in them that wytnessed in tymes past, whom we now calle martyrs, vnto the worlde, our sauiour Christe manfully sufferynge for his sake great tourmentes and peynes: Howe be it if any thyng maye cause a man to longe for dethe, truely it is the tourment of this sycknes. For I vtterly deny, that euer the father of Licinius Cecine, suffered any suche sorowe or peyne, whan he flewe hym selfe with the iuise of Papauers, Or that euer

any other, whiche dyd lykewyse, felt so intollerable euyls, as this syckenes causeth. For this pestilence besydes all his vexatiōs and tourmentes, (whiche passe farre all other) onely with his fowlenes and lothelynes is able to make one wery of his lyfe.
            ¶Whan Speusippus the philosopher was ones plucked and drawen with the palsey, that he dispeyred to escape, and then mette with Diogenes, and bad hym well to fare and good helthe: Diogenes (they say) answered, sayinge: And thou lykewyse farewell in no meanes, seinge thou art such one and canst be content to lyue.
            ¶The same Diogenes, that was wont to be so styffe a philosofer, what trow ye wold he haue sayd, if he had beholde & sene me, whā I was lykewyse vexed, as they yt had the palsey: and besydes that was so lothe som both in 
                  〈◊〉
                & sauour, that al were greued with me, & som did hate me? And yet I dyd lyue and had som hope / although I had ben oftētimes deluded and mocked through the gret promysis of the phisitiōs. And left any man shulde thynke that my disease was eyther lyght, or in one parte onely: I wyll shew in what takyng I was. Fyrst I could do nothynge with my lefte foote, for there

had this euyll dwelled .viii. yeres and more, and in the mydlegge, where the shynne is couered with fleshe very thynne, there were soores inflamed through the inflamation of the flesshe, rottynge with greatte ache and bournynge, and as soone as one waxed hoole, an other brake vp. For there were many, here some and there somme / whiche could by no help of the phisitiōs be brought to gether in one. Ouer them was a knobbe so harde, that a man wolde haue thought it a bone, and in that was excedynge peyne and ache, beatynge and pryckynge without ceassyng. There was also very nygh to the ryghte ancle aboue, a certayne swellynge and gatherynge / whiche was also harde like a bone, and was the oldest of all / wher in remayned the remenantes of this pestilence fresshe and newe rysen.
            ¶Whan the phisition went about this with yron, with fyre, with hotte yrons, or with any other instrumēt, they profited nothing: somtyme it was swollen very vehemently, with great peyne and akynge, somtyme it aswaged and was gentyller. And it greued me lesse whan my foote was holde towarde the fyre / and yet wold it not suffre to be couered with moche geare: it ranne so that a

man wolde haue thoughte hit wolde neuer haue ben stopped. And as often as I wolde reste or stonde vppon my foote, my peyne was intollerable: than vpwarde the calfe and the knee were meruayllous colde, and as thynges deed. The thygh was cleane worne away & cōsumed to extreme lennesse, and the skynne was so thynne, that there semed nothynge els lefte to couer the boone with. Moreouer the ioyntes were so louse, that longe tyme I had moch adoo to stonde hilone: and to be shorte: the one of my buttockes was but a thynge wethered awaye. In my lefte shulder there was suche peyne that I coulde not lyfte vp myn arme: the extreme partes of my shulders were weke and woxen verye styffe: in the myddes of the brawne of myn arme there was a swellynge as moche as an egge, and as for the reste of myn arme euen to the verye hande, was cleane worne away. And on the ryght syde a lyttell vnder the lowest rybbe, there had I a sore, whiche was not in dede peynfull / but it boyled out certayne fowle and stynkynge matter / and issued very fylthyly after the maner of a fistule with a narowe mouthe outwarde, and inwarde it was of a large holownes. And aboue hym there was

also an other as though a bone hadde bene bredde there vpon a rybbe. And to conclude I dyd playnly feele a streme and issue come downe behynde from the toppe of my heed vnto all these. And where it began the leeste touche in the worlde made my heed to work as though the brayn panne had ben broken
                  •
                nother myghte my face be tourned backewarde, but as it was tourned with the hole bodye. This one thynge yette wolle I not passe, wher from if Guaiacum had delyuered me, and done nothynge els, yet oughte I to haue lauded and preysed his vertue greatly, and that is noone slepe, whiche I coueyted so deedly, and was so moche gyuen therevnto, that almooste in .vi. yeres space there scaped not one daye / whan the phisitions cryed out vppon me, sayinge: that was the cause of all my diseases, and yet I coulde not refrayne my selfe from it. But nowe is that gone so far from me, that I trowe if I shuld enforce my selfe to slepe in the daye tyme, I coulde not. With all these, and so great euyls all though I was so maystred, that all men dispeyred my helth yet my good angell (I beleue) wylled me to tary and loke for somwhat. And lo through the helpe of Guaiacum I am bolde nowe to

               
                  •
               yne / and to drawe brethe agayne. Whiche mynde god gyue to all good men, that they neuer ceasse to hope and truste. As for me I repent my selfe in nothyng: and if by any meanes longe lyfe myght be graunted vnto me, I haue greatte hope that I shulde lyue hoole, sounde, and lusty. And of this disese, and of the remedy of Guaiacum / I haue wryttē these thynges that cam to my minde very faythfully, truely, and as my lernyng wolde suffre me: and here wolde I make an ende, if I thought it not necessary to admonysshe them, that shall rede these thynges, howe after this cure, the sicke muste be ordered, as touchynge the order and maner of theyr lyuynge, which thyng I wyll performe and that breuely.
         
         
            ¶As touchyng the ordre of lyuyng after this cure is paste what is to be obserued. Ca. xxvj.
            I Gaue warnyng before, that after this cure is paste, and the pacient is departed owte of the cloyster of this medicine, wherin he was close kept he must vse consequently

in his lyuing a certayn dyet and order by the space of .iii. or at the left .ij. hole monthes. And nowe that we be come to the very propre place to entreate of the same thynge / I say that it is so necessary to be done, that who so euer hath recouered his helthe, except he afterwardes take good hede, diligently obseruynge many thynges, and lyue for a space vnder a certayne rule, as though he were yet shut vp: I say playnly that his helth shall not longe endure. And therfore thre monethes are appoynted vnto suche as were eyther greattely consumed and lowe brought in theyr syckenes, and hadde many issues, and auoyded moch, or els were sore hurt in there synowes and lymmes, or be so weakened, in their body, that a lyttell tyme can nat be sufficient to gether vp perfitely: their crōmes agayne. And on the other side, they that be stronge and not so farre gone, nor broken, vnto suche, ii. monethes after their settyng out ar ynough as it is thought. But by cause I wolde prouyde surely for them that wyll folowe me, I wyll aduyse them to obserue and kepe this prescripte very longe, and to begynne with, they shall absteyne them selfes longe tyme frome the flesshely acte: Bycause they that be recouered

through Guaiacum, haue theyr bodies very tender and vtterly weake as yet, as thoughe they had bene lately newe borne? And therfore if they shulde haue the company of woman, wherby the newe gotten strength is weke and grene, and not yet ryped: it wolde by and by dissolue and destroy the strengthe and myghtis of all the membres for euer. And for as moche as the vse of carnall copulation bryngeth into peryll not one membre by hym selfe but al the hole bodye at one choppe: What other thynge may we saye, he pretendeth, that medleth carnally with women (beinge so febled) thā wyllyngly to 
                  •
               lee hym selfe, or at the lefte spedily to distroy his naturall strength, and playnly caste his helth away?
            ¶And if some be forbodden the companye of women, whiche be neuer the lesse of good lykynge in body, and haue no disease at all: Howe moche ought they to auoyde and flee it, that thus haue lost theyr helth & myght, and must labo
                  •
               r al that they can to repayre the same agayne? And if before, xiiii. yere of age none is stronge inough vnto that act, bycause his strength is not full furnyshed to putte so ieoperdous a thynge in experience: How than ought he to beware & take hede / 

that is thus newe borne agayne, and hath so yonge & tender a body, that he offer not hym selfe to be rasshely plucked and toore
                  •
                before he haue receyued his strength, and is well hardned therin.
            &The nexte poynt here vnto is this, that though they shall haue a gredye and sharpe appetite to meate, beinge emptied with continuall hunger, yet they muste resyste the same, and as moche as maye be to behaue them selfe very soberly and scarsely in their fedynge. And therfore they muste fyrste vse verye lyttell meate, and afterwarde some what more, goinge forth by lyttell and lyttell, so that there maye be a good space er that they come to theyr olde custome of eatynge, exercysynge them selfe softely, begynnynge no newe thynge hastely or sodenly, vtterly absteinynge fro al wynes except it be fyrste delayed with moche water, and be also of hit selfe smalle and of good sauour and clere, and yet so, very moderatly: Let hym also, that is cured, be well fensed agaynst the violence of the ayer, and specially in those tymes that be greuous with colde wynde and rayne, or els let hym goo forth abrode very seldome. He maye take meate twyse aday, but at euentyde very lytell:

and all that tyme he maye neuer folowe his appetite, but muste auoyde fulnes, as the greattest euyll, that can be. He must also aboue all thynges forbeare fysshe, and feade vpon yonge and tender flesshe, suche as is of lyghte digestion, and nouryssheth purely: whiche they be ye maye knowe by the phisitions teachynges. And these thynges must haue place, in the sayde two or .iii. monethes, for other thynges whiche shall be further obserued, maye be serned more playnly in the thynges folowyng. For now I wylle aduyse and monysshe with fewe wordes, not onely them that are recouered by Guaiacum, but other as wel from what soo euer disease they be delyuered, if they tender their good helthe and welfare, and desyre to be longe in prosperitie, whatte thynges they shall folowe. And here hit is chiefly to be noted (howe be it all doth now knowe it) that this one thynge is it that maketh this sycknes to be very greuous, bycause there is great difficultie in dyetynge. For whan this disease is ouercome, hit is not one onely that muste be obserued in the order of our lyuynge, but many thynges: and dyuerse muste be reckened vppon. In so moche as what so euer thynges there

be, whether they be with or agaynst all the diseases, whiche I sayde before folowed this syckenes, he that is recouered, muste sette them before hym: endeuorynge hym selfe with all diligence to obteyn them / that make with hym, and to auoyde them that be ageynst hym. Wherfore he muste be allwayes very carefull in his lyuynge, that all thynge may be done ordinately. Not withstondynge if this medicine haue saued any, there is for them great comforte, bycause they that are expert therof, plainly thynke, that after the pacientes haue ones receyued their helth, & the tyme of obseruation, which foloweth this cure be past, nothinge that is not contrary to theyr olde maner of liuyng can putte them in any daunger, so that they vsed not before to liue without order vtterly. For that same order shal serue hym, that is thus restored, as shall serue them, that neuer had the sycknes. Wherfore they think it not so moche to be regarded, what a man eateth, as howe moche he eateth: And ther fore no kynde of meate to be forborne, no choise of meate to be hadde, concernynge the qualitie of fedynge, nothynge to be cared fore, but that whiche is knowen to apperteygne to the commen conseruation of

helthe, and to the vniuersall auoydynge of all maladies and diseases. Wherin that that Celsus teacheth, perchance shall not be the leeft, whiche is, that euerye man take hede, lefte whyle his bodye is in prosperitie, the aydes and succour ageynst aduersite be consumed and wasted.
            ¶Helthe is preserued (as the same Celsꝰ sayth) by dyet, by medicines, by oyntynges, by frictions & rubbynges, by baynes, by exercyse, by caryage aboute, by clere and pleasant readynge: whiche thynges howe they ought to be considered fully and holle, I leue you to aske of hym. Here wylle I breuely touche a fewe thynges, and suche as apperteyne to dyete. This I thinke they muste fede pleasauntely and moderately / and take suche meates and drynkes as be of lyghtest digestion. For as Paule saythe, The chiefes
                  •
                poynt of education is, that the meate be suche as wyll lyghtly digeste and nourysshe well, not slowe in digestynge, nor clammye / nor plentuous in superfluities: and the drynke to be smalle wyne / whyte, pure, and a lyttell delayde with water. And Celsus saith: Se your meate be nat fatty, clammy, nor wyndy. And by his coū
               sell ye muste absteyne in all suche diseases

from all maner salte meates, sharp, sowre, and bytter. For the same reason I thynke, wherof I made mētion before. And Paule saythe, In eatynge, the greattest fawte is satietie and fulnes, For al though the bealy digeste well / yet the veynes to moche replenysshed, laboure soore / they swelle, they breake / they be stopped and fylled with wynde, and playne it is, that the worst diseases of all comme of sacietie. He thynketh this onely to be auoyded, that no man fylle hym selfe. And I iuge the same but not onely, for I wolde more ouer nothynge to be dressed deinteously, nothynge to be sa
                  •
               ced curiously, and that many dysshes of dyuerse kyndes be nat sette before vs / nother wyll (as these ryche menne vse) sixe. or .vii. or sometyme .x. meases at one soupper to be brought in: For a man wolde not beleue, howe moche these thynges hurte, not onely the stomake, but also the holle digestion. And therfore I wil repete agayn this thing whiche is spoken of the same author: Varietie of meates is greatly to be auoyded, specially whan contrarye operations and vertues be in them. For whan they be so thruste in, they resist digestion. And the same thynketh Galene, and A
                  •
               icene / and as many

as be of pure iudgement in phisicke.
            ¶Cato (as Tully wryteth) commandeth so moche meate and drynke to be receyued, as may refresshe the strength and power of the body, and not oppresse it. Wherfore by the counsell of Xenophon, we muste make for the most parte a small dyner, that there may be a place for the supper.
            ¶Playnly this disease is of that sort, that Galenus thynketh to come of fulnes: whiche thynge is thus to be vnderstande, not that I thynke all that lyueth in surfetynge, streight way to be caste into the french pockes (al though suche shall not escape diseases, no not most greuous) but if any haue ben vexed before with them, and than healed, eate & drynke intemperately, he must nedes fall agayn into them. And therfore the meate that is receyued, let it nother be dyuerse nor moch, that the stomake be not loded, and digestion letted. And agayne let it be (as I monysshed) easye in digestynge. Plinie sayth, All maner sharpe meates, all that is to moche, and all that is hastely receyued be harde in workynge / and harder in somer than in wynter, and harder in age than in youthe.
            ¶It is wryten in Tully, he that medleth

                this cure is done, we muste prouyde, howe the bodye, that hath hytherto bene emptied and made leane, maye be brought ageyn vnto his olde state, therfore peraduenture those meates muste be vsed / that increace and fylle the body, not with noyfull humours, but suche as Celsus rehersethe in the .iij. chapter of the fyrste boke.
            ¶Plinie also sayth, The bodies growe and increace with swete and fatte meates and with drynke: they diminisshe and go downe with drye, leane, and colde meates and thurste. But this muste be wysely vnderstonde, for those thynges whiche I haue often before monysshed. But seinge Galenus warneth vs in all thynges to take hede to the bealy, For what so euer, sayth he, is corrupted, in that it is a cause of rot vnto al the body, and so of diseases: I thynke hit beste to take those drynkes and meates, as Celsus teacheth, which
                  •
                do bothe norysshe and make the bealy soft.

And if nother of these be regarded, or to late proued, than peraduenture he muste go to phisike, whervnto if the sycke be compelled, I can gyue hym none other commaundement, but euen the same whiche I haue oftentymes spoken, that he commytte hym selfe to a sober and lerned phis

            ¶As concernynge meates, whiche be holsome, and whiche vnholsomme, and howe euery kynde of meates helpeth or hurteth, excepte a man declare it to the vttermost, it were better speake nothynge thereof: And therfore
                  •
                I wolde haue the authors redde, as Celsus, whiche entreateth shortly of the kyndes of meates. And Paulus which handleth at large in .xxiiij. chaptres the natures and vertues of meates: or els Galenus whiche by him selfe is sufficient for all, pretermyttynge nothynge in the bokes of nourysshementes. And so wolde I nowe haue made an ende of feadynge, if there had not chanced to come to my mynde certayn thynges worthy to be noted. And fyrste I wyll admonysshe you of egges. There is no meate (sayth Plinie) lyke egges that noryssheth in syckenes, and lyeth not heuy, and that is in stede of wyne and meate bothe. And Aui
                  •
               ene affirmeth, that the yolkes of egges of a henne, of a partrige, or of a phesaunte do passe all meates for them that

haue theyr bloud diminished or theyr harte faynted. Alexander Aphrodisens thynketh that it conteyneth in it selfe the qualites of all the elementes, and to conclude there is in an egge a certayne shewe of the worlde, bothe because it is made of the foure elementes, and agayne bycause it is gathered rounde in sphere fascion, And hath a lifely power. Egges fryed manye doo forbydde: amonge the whiche are Paulus and Galenus. And dothe not alowe the foode of herbe
                  •
               . And many other do forbyd the same, although Marcꝰ Cato praiseth brassicā aboue the mone. He that eateth dayly his fylle of ptisana, his nutrimente Galenus thinketh can by none other meates be hyndred. And the same thynge wolde I say (saythe he) by beanes: if they fylled not with wynde. Of the vse of milke both in meates and also in medicines, Paule dothe intreate verye goodly. Alexander saythe, mylke is lyghte in digestynge, and nouryssheth well. For that may lyghtly go into bloudde, that is made of bloudde, and in a maner hit is bloud made whyte.
            ¶Of manye thynges I haue shewed you a few, but yet he that desireth to haue helth, ought, saythe Paule, to knowe howe great

power wyne hathe. And the same saythe, if wyne frete anye man, he muste drynk colde water. And the nexte daye drynke the iuise of wormewode, and walke vppon it: he must rubbe his body and wasshe it, and than refresshe hym selfe with lyttell meate. Wynes that were lately must, and also wynes that be to olde must be auoyded, sayth Galenus. For these heate to moche, and the other nothynge at all. That fedynge faythe Paule, that kepeth a man bare and sklender is moche surer for the helthe, than that whiche maketh one fat. But for as moche as lyttell meate gyueth nother strength nor stedynes vnto the bodye, therfore he after addethe sayinge, Suche meates as are of a meane nature, are the chiefe nourysshementes of all. For they ingender bloudde of a meane substance. And as such are most metest & cō
               uenient for our bodies, so be they that bring forth yll humours moste noyfull, and therfore muste they alwayes be auoyded. This saythe Paule. And he teacheth more ouer / that rye breadde nouryssheth more than all other, and that wheaten breade is of harde digestion and wyndy, and that barly breade is of lyttell strengthe. He that wyll knowe the vttermooste of fedynge, lette hym rede

this Paule and Galenus as I sayde
                  •
                we in this countreye neuer vsed annoyntynges, in Italie they haue vsed them, but nowe they be almooste lefte. And Galene cōmendethe rubbynges of the body aboue all thynges, inculcatynge oftentymes and many thinges therof, and specially in his bokes of preseruynge helthe. And the same doth Asclepiades hyghly a
                  •
               ance, and Hippocrates also very greatly, whose saying this is which was after hym repeted of many. Through rubbynge, if it be vehement, the bodye is made harde, if it be softe and easye, the bodye is made softe, if it be moch, it diminissheth, if it be meane, it fylleth.
            ¶In our days that high lerned man Erasmus Roterodamus, vsynge thus dayly and specially in the mornynge at his vprysynge, thinkith therbi that he preserueth his helth, the weakenes of his body (whiche is verye great) not withstondynge. And hathe warned me diligently, that aboue al other thinges I and all other studentes shulde vse the same. I folowe the counsell of my frende, and fynde ease therin. Somme forbydde wasshynges and all maner bathes, and they saye, that they be vnholsomme for all suche as be recouered from this disease.

I thynke by cause they mollifie the synowes, and lose them, and therfore they wyll not that water shulde touche them: and yet they do not, sauynge for that, improue sweattynges, water hurtethe the synowes though it be warme saythe Alexander: not bycause it is warme, but bicause it is moyst. Paule commendyng warme wasshyng saith thus: It taketh away werynes, it shaketh downe fulnes, it heateth, it mitigateth, hit mollifieth, it disperseth, it prouoketh slepe
                  •
                and maketh all the body fatte. And is very commodious and agreable both to man and woman yonge and olde, so sayth Paule. Not withstondynge the Italianes nowe a dayes wasshe not but very seldome, wherof I doo not meruaylle, seinge in tymes paste they vsed it dayly as wrytynge testifieth, & also the tokens of the b

            ¶In exercises Galene teacheth, that mesure muste be kepte and obserued, sayinge, Immoderatenes I reproue euery where. He lykewise sayth: As exercise before meat is ye chiefest thyng to preserue helth, so is al maner motion after meate most noyful. For the meat is scatered out of the bely before it be digested, and therof gadreth many grosse

and rawe humours in the veynes, wherof all maner diseses are wont to be ingendred. Paule aduyseth vs, so longe to exercise our selfe, vntyll the body begynne to swelle and waxe reed, our motions stronge, equall, and easye, and the swette seme to be mixed with vapour: than fyrste to reste, whan any of these begynnne to chaunge. They monysshe also to gyue reste and quietnesse vnto that membre, whiche was lately restored to helthe. And Hipocrates saythe: The remedye of the foote is reste. Wherof Alexander gathereth that that, which is heled again must nedes haue reste. For motion (saythe he) causeth flowynges of the superfluous matter, whiche may reyse and styr vp inflamation. The worst thynge that can be to hym that hath akynge knees, is to ryde, saythe Celsus. He also thynketh hit not good for them that be gowtie. The old men exercised them selfe also in voyce that they moughte synge and also rede more clerely.
            ¶I sayd I wold entreate of these thynges, as occasyon gaue, not moche regardynge any order, but as euery thyng, worthy to be noted, shuld com to mynd. And therfore let no man loke for any greatte thynge here, if there be any that wolde knowe, I haue shewed

in what authors what thynges he shall fynde. But loo here commeth an other to mynde, he that wyl preserue his helth, must take hede (saythe Galene) to .ij. thynges specially: one is, that the meate be agreinge and mete for hym: an other is, that there folowe good brookynge, and clensynge of those superfluities, that are lefte of the meate. It is recyted by Paule, that the olde men thought it was sufficient to defend and preserue helth: if the bourden of the bely & bladder were dayly vnloded wel & without faulte, accordynge to the portion of the meate and drinke receyued. Galene as concernynge the vse of Venus, hathe lefte nothynge vntouched, affirmynge that acte to be an ennemy vnto the helthe of all them that are drye of complexion, and specially of them that are also colde. For Venus (sayth he) is vnhurtefull onely vnto them that be hote and moyste, and be aboundant of sede. And ageyne he saythe: They that haue theyr bodies well tempered and without fault, ought not vtterly to absteyn from Venus, as they that be cold and dry ought. Also Paule sayth: drye copulations hurteth all men, and moste of all if colde be ioyned to dryeth: so that they onely / whiche be

hote and moyste, may vse it without ieoperdye. As labours are profytable vnto helth, so are also copulations if they be vsed with mesure. This one thyng ought all to know, that al they that haue had the frenche pockes ought with grea
                  •
                care, for loue of their synowes to auoyde carnall copulation. Paule iudgeth it well done to exercyse children, that through the labour of body and mynd, they may be brydeled and restrayned from the violence of bodily pleasure. Hipocrates compareth that act vnto the fallyng sycknes. Alexander Magnus was wont to say, that copulation and slepe were two the greattest tokens of mortalite.
            ¶The holsomes also of the ayre muste be loked vppon, which is a good post of helth. That ayre, sayth Paule, whiche is infected with euyll vapours, puffynge out pestilent blastes, or is nygh vnto a synke or draught, or is mustie / or is kepte in a vallie, compassed roūd about with hilles hurteth al ages. And the beste ayre is most holsome. For vnto a temperat body a tēperate aire is profitable, sayth he, and a distempred is for hym that hath a contr
                  •
               ry temperature. Sicknes is nothyng els, sayth Galene, sauyng a motion without nature. Thā he sayth: The phisitions

vnderstōde hym to be hole, al whose mēbres be according to the cours of nature: & contrarywise thā to be syck, if any part go out from his nature. It is forbidden by the doctrine a
                  •
                the phisitions, that no mā drink streight vpon chafyng. They say also, that al sodayn changes are dangerous. This is also admitted for trouth, that contynuall idelnes is most contrary to good helth. And cōtrary wise, Meane exercyse is great aide & socour. Galen saith, depe rest of the body is the greattest euyl that can be for the preseruyng of the helth, as moderate labour is the greattest good. As perteynyng to slepe, whan it ought to be taken and howe moche Paule teacheth abundantly, and also what commodities folowe, whan it is well taken in tyme. With noone slepe there is none that holdeth. For suche as be of a sad nature, or be troubled with thought and care / the phisitions iugeth very good to cal for som maner pastimes & mirthe, to finde out by some meanes, wherby the hart may be chered, & the sadnes of mynde eased. Pensi
                  •
               enes saith Paule, must be dryuen away with the swetenes of soundes.
            ¶He that is in good helth (sayth Celsus) & at his owne libertie nedeth to care nother

for medicines nor oyntmentes. Which thing as I do allowe, and wolde not them that be of good lykynge and helth to be bounde greatly to any maner rule of lyuynge: so thynke I it nedefull for them, that haue ben sycke, or haue syckely bodyes, or do folowe suche kynde of lyuynge, that they can nat well defende the bodyly helthe, to haue a rule of lyuynge, to order them selfe by. For Galene monyssheth, that a lawe and rule of lyuynge is in no wise superfluous. For dyete, sayeth he, is a verye medicine.
            ¶These thynges that I haue here wryten, moste noble prince, I repute moste profytable to this pourpose, bothe by myn owne and others experience, and also by the teachynge of them that were hyghly lerned.
