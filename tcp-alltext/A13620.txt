                  36 Te eſſe puto infra omnes infimos homines, I repute thee to bee the moſt villayne of all villaynes.
                  37 Qui huic aſſentari animum induxeris, That couldeſt finde in thy harte to flatter ſuch a fellow as this is Valla. lib. 5. Eleg. cap. 66. ſheweth the difference betweene theſe three verbes, aſſentor; adûlor and blandior. Aſſentari, is to flatter any body, affyrming his ſayinges, and

vpholding his yea and his nay, or praiſing him to much, or els many tymes otherwyſe then the truth is, to the ende to get ſome profite and aduauntage thereby, & it is properly in wordes. And therefore this kinde of flattery, called Aſſentation, is not in any brute beaſt, but onely in man. Plaut. Extempló, quaſi res cum ea eſſet mihi, coepi aſſétari, mulier quicquid dixerat, idē ego dicebam. Anone, as though I had had to doe with her, I began to ſooth her, and to hold her vp with yea and nay, and whatſoeuer ſhee ſayde, I ſayd the ſame. Idem. Aſſentandum eſt quicquid hic mē
                        
                           •
                        ietur. whatſoeuer lye this folowe ſhall make, wee muſt ſooth or vpholde it, and ſay as he doth Terence himſelfe in y• ſecōd Scene of the ſecond Acte of this ſame Comodye, doth beſt of all declare the nature of this verbe Aſſentor, aris: where Gnato ſayeth thus: Hos confector, hiſce ego non paro me vt rideant, ſed his vltiò arrideo, & eorum ingenia admiror ſimul: quicquid dicunt, laudo, id rurſum ſi negant, laudo, id quoque. Negat quis, nego, ait, aio. Poſtremò imperaui egomet mihi omnia aſſentari, is quaſtus nunc eſt multo vberrimus, ſuch menne doe I follow at the tayle, or at the hard Heeles, or the Elbow (for that is conſectari) and among ſuch perſous I doe not ſo faſhiō my ſelfe, that they may laugh at mee, but contrartwyſe, whatſoeuer they ſey or doe, I ſhewe them a mery countenaunce of myne owne ſelfe, and alſo make a great marueyling at their high wils, Whatſoeuer they

ſay, I commend it, and if they denye the ſame agayne, that alſo I commend, if a man ſay nay, I ſay nay alſo: if he ſay yea. I ſay yea to.
                  And for a concluſion to be ſhort, I mayſter, & rule mine owne ſelfe, to vphold his yea and his nay, & to ſooth him and to ſay as he ſayth in all manner thinges, for that is the next way now a dayes to get money ynough.
                  
                     Adûlari is to flatter an other man in hūblinge himſelfe, and beyng ſeruiſeable about him, and to labour by ſuch faſhions to winne and get his fauour, whether it be by voyce, & wordes, or els by geſture of the body, or by any other way, or meane, whatſoeuer it bee. Nonius Marcel. ſayth thus: Adulatio eſt proprié canum blandimentum quod ad homines conſuetudine tranſlatum eſt, Adulation properly ſignifyeth the fauning and 
                        •
                     raping of Degs vpon their maiſters, from which property by tranſlation it is applyed onely to men by vſe of ſpeakinge, and not by the proper ſignification of the word. Where note, that Adûlor is a verbe deponent and gouerneth a Datiue caſe. Valer Max Diogenes Syracuſis, cum olera ei lauanti Auiſtippus dixiſſet. Si Dionyſio adulari velles, iſta non eſſes: Im
                           •
                         inquit, ſi tu iſta eſſe velles, Dionyſio non adûlaris, Diogenes in the Citty of Sarragous (when that Ariſtippus had ſayd vnto hym, as he was waſhinge herbes for a Salette theſe wordes. If thou wouldeſt ſeeke fauoure of Dyoniſius the tyraunt, and flatter hym, thou ſhouldeſt not eate ſuch meate as

that) he aunſwereth and ſayd agayne: Nay it thou wouldeſt eate ſuch meate as this, thou ſhouldeſt not neede to flatter Dyonyſius.
                  
                  Yet Cornelius Tacitus ioyned the ſame verbe deponent with an accuſatine ſaying, Tigillinum aut quem alium adulatus eſt. He flattered Tigil linus or ſum other man. There is alſo read Adulo, as, aui, are, an actiue, or tranſ

Albeyt the dictionaryes take adulat there, for lambit or bibit, as who ſhoulde ſay in Engliſhe, ſhee ſweeted her lippes, licking and ſucking vp my bloud. And Cic. lib. 1. off. vſeth the paſſiue of the ſame, Cauendum eſt, ne aſſentatoribus patefaciamus aures neue adulari nos ſinamus. We muſt beware that we open not our eares to flatterers, nor ſuffer our ſelues to be won, or ouercōmed with fauninge, or humble behauioure of others towardes vs. For there Cicero doth manifeſtlye put a difference betweene aſſentatiō and adulation

The Poet Lucrecius, vſed Audûlo, as, aui, as a verbe neuter abſolutely, that is to ſay, not ioyning any caſe with him in that verſe: Longe alio pacto gannitu vocis adûlant. And Linacre in the place of Val. Max. aboue cited readeth thus. Diogenes Saracuſis, cum olera ei lauaoti Ariſtippus dixiſſet. Si Dionyſic adulari velles, iſta non eſſes: Imò inquit, ſi tu Dionyſium non adulares, illa non eſſes: But I find not the latter in any examplary yt I haue hetherto ſeene, but the commentaries reade, Si Dionyſio non adulares, that it be a verbe neutre, gouerning a Datiue, where Oliuerus noteth yt many verbes be neuters in o, and deponents in or, and of the ſame ſignification, as populo and populor, impertio impertior, adûlo and adûlor. &c.

                  4 Dum haec reputo, praeterij imprudens villam. Whyle I recounted theſe thinges in my mynde I was gone paſt my houſe in the countrey. Villa properlye is a ferme houſe, or, a manour houſe, or any other houſe made and ſet without the City to dwel in, and to haue huſbandry occupied, deriued as Varro Li▪ 1▪ de re ruſt. Cap. 2. ſayth a vehendo of carying: for that the huſbādman carieth in thither ſuch fruits as come out of the ground: and ſemblably caryeth them out agayne, when they muſt bee ſolde. In Villa, moſt commonly are twoo partes, the one that the Farmer, or hynd, or whatſoeuer perſon els, (occupying the huſbandrye, belonging vnto the ſame) dwelleth in, and there maketh, or, keepeth all manner inſtrumentes appertayning to huſbandrye, as corne, cartes, yokes for exē &c. and that was called by the latine men of olde tyme Villa ruſtica. The other part is that which the Lorde, or, owner reſerueth and kepeth for

himſelfe to dwel in for his pleaſure, and that was called Villa vrbana, becauſe it was in all poyntes as goodly, and as well appoynted, as becommeth a houſe ſtanding within the citty to bee (and was more pleaſauntlye builded, and more goodly decked and better furniſhed with all implementes of houſholde, and kept more nete and cleane, then for a houſe of the country. Varro. li. de re ruſt. Fructuoſior certè fundus eſt propter aedificia ſi potius ad antiquorum diligentiam, quam ad horum luxuriam dirigas aedificationē. Illi enim ad fructū rationem faciebant, hi ad libidines indomitas. Itaque illorum villae ruſticae erant maiores, quam vrbanae, quae nunc ſunt pleraeque. Of a verye certayntye a mans ground is the more fruitfull and profitable for the houſing that is builded vppon it, yf a man order and faſhion the buildinge and framing and ſetting vp of it after the diligent faſhion of men of old tyme, rather then after the prodigall exceſſiue and ouer ſumptuous faſhion of men that are now a dayes. For the men of olde tyme made their buildinges in the coū
                     try, as was moſt conuenient for the fruites of the ground to bee receiued thereinto, and now a dayes they build for pleaſure, that is neuer ruled by any reaſon, nor neuer ſatiſfied, therfore their Villae ruſticae were bigger and larger thē manye Villae vrbanae that are now a dayes.

                  33 Edico tibi. I tell thee openly. Edico, edicis, edixi, edicere, edictū, is properly to proclaime, & perteineth only to princes, officers, and rulers, and thereof hoc edictum edicti, edicto, is the commaundement geuen or proclaimed by any prince, ruler, or officer. But heere edico, is takē for clarè dico, & clarè proloquor To ſpeake or pronounce out aloude wythout any feare or diſſimulation. For e. and ex. in compoſition haue much that ſignification, as eruo, is to get or to myne a thinge out of the earth, or any other place, where it is hard to come by. Egero is to caſt out, efferro, is to bring out, expello, is to thruſt out, Eloquor is to ſpeake out aloude, and ſo edico heere is to ſpeake out aloude. And in the ſame ſignification did Terence vſe edico

Veſtrum tam ſuperbum to be put abſolutely, that is ſubſtantiuely, as Veſtrum tam ſuperbum .i. veſtram tantam ſuperbiam.

                  47 Magis oportunus, nec magis ex vſu tuo nemo eſt. There is no man more meete for it, nor no man more to your commodity. Oportunus .i. Idoneus, meete for the purpoſe. Heere note that three negations do no more to the Senſe, nor haue no more ſignification nor ſtrength, then two, as Nunquam mihi nec obfuiſti, nec profuiſti. Thou neuer diddeſt mee neyther harme ne good. Cic. in tuſc. quaeſti. Neſcierunt nec vbi, nec qualia eſſent, They knew not neyther where nor what thinges they were. Ibid. Nihil nec diſputare, nec ſcribere praetermiſi. I omitted nothing, neither to diſpute and reaſon nor to wryte. Note alſo that two or three negations doe ſometimes deny with more vehemency. Pl. li. 18. cap. 4. Oculorum vitia fieri negant, nec lippire eos qui cum pedes lauant, aqua inde ter oculos tangant. It is a ſayinge that they ſhall neuer haue Diſeaſes in their eyes, nor ſhall not bee bleare eyed, which when they waſhe their feete, touche their eyes thryſe

with the ſame water. Examples bee innumerable, and Budaeus hath noted the ſame largely and copiouſly in his Annotations vppon the Pandects of the Ciuill lawe.

Of the ſignificatiō of theſe two words frugalitas, and frugi ſaith thus: Sed quià nèc qui propter metum preſidiū relinque, quod eſt ignauiae, nec qui propter auaritiam clàm depoſitum non reddit, quod eſt iniuſtitiae: nec qui propter temeritatem male rē geſſit, quod eſt ſtultitiae frugi appellari ſolet, eas tres virtutes, fortitudinem iuſtitiam, & prudentiam, frugalitas cōplexa eſt ergo frugi hominem bonum, et virtute praeditū intelligimus, Cuius cōtrarium eſt nequè, cuius ſignificatio vna eſt, quòd ſit libidinis intemperans, altera, quod ad nihil bonus ſit, ſed planè malus. But for becauſe that neither hee, which for feare forſaketh his garriſon, which to do is a poynt of daſtardneſſe or cowardneſſe, nor hee that for auarice or courtous deſire and loue of goods, mony or any other thinge, being

which is vntrue and vnrighteous dealing, neyther hee that for temerity or willfull raſheneſſe and lacke of diſcretion, hath had euill luck and miſaduēture or miſfortune in his matters or affayres (ſpecially in battaile) which is a token and the property of fooliſhneſſe, becauſe that no ſuch perſon is commonly or vſually called in latin frugi. Therefore this latin worde frugalitas, in ſignification conteyneth & betokeneth as much as all theſe three vertues: that is to weete, hardyneſſe, righteouſneſſe, or true and vpright dealing, and alſo prudence or much knowledge & experience of thinges. So it followeth, that when wee ſay in latin Frugi homo wee vnderſtand thereby a good and honeſt man, and endued with manhoode and vertue.
