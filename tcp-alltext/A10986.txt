            ¶ The firſt Tale of the Emprice is of the gude tre that grew in the Burges Gardine, and for the Imp that grew beſyde it he gart cut the greit tre.
            
               
                  IN Romes Toun remanit ane riche Burges
               Quhilk had at welth all mirth and merines
               With fair biggings, quhilk was baith braid & hie
               With gay gardings, yat was pleſand to ſe
               Of alkin flouris he had thairin ane part
               That was to get about in euerie art.
               To tell thair Names I neid not now tak tome
               Few was ſiclyke, ſa pleſand in all Rome.
               In this Gardine thair grew ane Nobill trie
               Quhilk euerie ȝeir brocht furth frute gude plētie
               Sine by all this the frute that on it grew
               Was ſa done ſweit, and of ſa greit vertew.
               Quhat man that had ony ſair Maladie,
               As is Liper, Erces or Popplecie.
               Sa ſone as he of this frute gat ane taiſt,
               Of all ſeiknes he wald be haill in haiſt.
               And ſa it chancit vpon ane haly day,
               This Burges went in his Garding to ſay
               His Oriſouns, and behalding this trie
               Ane gay ȝoung Imp behynd it quyetlie
               He ſaw growand, quhilk was proper and fair,
               Incontinent he callit the Gairdnair.
               He ſaid gude freind ſe ȝe be wonder ſure,
               And of this Imp daylie that ȝe tak cure,
               For I beleue to haue ane better tre
               Of that ȝoung plant and better be ſic thre
               Nor is the auld, quhilk I can not auance
               That pith Inlaikis, ſap ſapour and ſubſtance.
               Howbeit this tre be far growin it abone,
               
                  
The Gairdnar ſaid. Maiſter it ſall be done.
               Within few dayis to ſchaw the for certane
               To ſe this plant the Burges come agane,
               Quhilk as he thorht, was not half ſa pleſand
               As it was quhen, the firſt day he it fand.
               To the Gairdnar he ſaid how can this be
               My tender plant, appeiris not to me
               Half ſa pleſand, as it was the laſt day.
               He ſaid Maiſter, now tak tent quhat I ſay
               Na wonder is, this auld tre is far mair
               And fra the ȝoung takis all ſubſtance and air.
               Be the reſſoun the branches ar ſo braid.
               Sa the ȝoung plant is ſa vnliklie maid.
               For gif this plant gat the ſubſtance and air
               That this tre gettis, belyue it wald grow mair,
               Nor is the auld for eild almaiſt is deid,
               The Burges ſaid thairof I wait remeid.
               Cut doun the bewis and branches of the auld.
               Quod he Maiſter, I ſall do as ȝe haue tauld.
               And ſa he did, ſyne efter in ſchort ſpace
               To ſe the plant, agane come the Burges,
               And ſaw richt weill, that the ſame tender plant

               To the Gairdnar he ſaid how chancis this
               My tender plant it dois miſthriue I wis.
               Schaw me the caus thairof without leſing,
               He ſaid Maiſter. I ſuppois of ane thing,

               Co alkin thing that euer grew thairout.
               And als the rane it may not cum it neir

Thir twa wanting, thair is na tre ean thrine
               The Burges ſaid, that ſall we mend beliue.
               Cut the auld clene, and quite doun be the rute,
               For I ſuppone we ſall get better frute,
               Of this ȝoung tre, nor of the auld was had,
               The Gairdnar did as his Maiſter him bad.
               Cuttit the auld, and leit the ȝoung ſtand ſtill,
               Sa he obeyit his Maiſters minde and will.
               Efter ſchort time as this was done and wrocht,
               Baith auld and ȝoūg periſcht and come to nocht

               Quhilk to cut doun, it was ane greit pietie.
               And quhen the pure perſauit it was cut doun,
               Thay curſt waryit, with mony maleſoun.

               And haldin furth fra all gude companie,
               This was the Law that time of this Cietie.
               This foirſaid Knicht quhairof I ſpak of air,
               Was growin in age, ane auld man and ane hair
               His rampand rage of ȝouth he had compleit,

               And ſa ſcho did, ane man of tender age
               In luſt is bour for to win vaſſalage.
               Quha had ane quyer Chalmer in the toun.
               Sa euerie nicht efter this Knicht lay doun,

               To hir ȝoung lufe ſcho went quhair that he lay
               And ſa ſcho did, als oft as euer ſcho liſt,

               So it befell vpon ane wynter nicht

               Vpon hir Name he cryit ofter nor thriſe,
               Scho anſwerit not, than he begouth to riſe,
               Socht all the hous be na way culd hir find.
               And wiſt not weill gif ſcho was out or in.

               Paſt to the ȝettis, all oppin he thame fand,
               But mair auiſe he cloſit thame fra hand.
               In ane windo that oppinnit vp to the gait
               Mekill of the nicht thair ſat he at the wait,
               And quhen it was about the thrid Cok craw
               Makand hir hame, his awin wife he ſaw,

               Neuer the les becaus the ȝettis was lokkit,

               Than ſaid the Knicht, O thow woman vnclene

Than ſaid the wife, my Lord quth

               Thairfoir gude Lord I pray ȝow hartflulie
               Tak na ſuſpect, nor think na fault in me.
               For I had neuer ſic thing in my thocht

For verie ſturt in hir minde was richt wo

               To hir Chalmer than ſcho paſt ſone within,

               And cryit aloude that euer I was borne,
               Into my Cude, ſen I had bene forlorne.

               That is the caus I will not pas my way.
               For gif I did than ane caus it wald be,
               Of greit diſcord, and Inammitie:

               For ſa lang time as God will len me life,

               Sa ſcho began with all erpeditioun,
               As ſcho beſt culd to ſay furth hir Sermon.
            
            
               
                  IN this Cietie that now is callit Rome,
               Quhilk in pai dapis was heid of criſtindome
               
                  
Thair dwelt ane Knicht, the ſuith ȝow for to ſay
               Had bot ane Sone, and he had Douchters twap
               This Knicht was geuin to Halking & Hunting
               Greit Tornamentis, and to ſwift hors rinning.
               To merynes and all kind of pleſour,
               That micht hald vp and furth ſet his honour.
               Sa euerie ȝeir ſa greit riches he ſpent,

               His daylie cheir, and expens did decres.
               In that meane time thair was ane Emprour

               That his compair was not vpon the ground.
               That in ſo muche, he had in his treaſoure
               Of Gold ſiluer, the quhilk fulfild ane Towre.
               Quhilk gold & Towre, thocht he it had at large
               To ane greit Knicht to keip he gaue in charge.
               This vther Knicht quhome of we ſpak of air,
               That had ſpendit his rent and mekill mair.
               On Idill gammes, as Hunting and Halking.
               Lait ſitting vp, and out of time ſpending.
               To ſic pureteth, he grew and greit thirlage,
               That he behuid to ſell his heritage.
               He callit to him his Sone quhilk was his Air,
               And all the caſe to him he culd declair.
               This is the caſe, but dout my Sone

               It is better tak fra the Empreour
               Part of his Gold, his Siluer and treaſour.
               Than ȝe to ſell ȝour land and heritage,

               In Halking Hunting and in Tornament,
               Quhil at the laſt the Gold was gane and ſpent.
               In the meane time, the keipar of the Towre
               Quhilk had in charge all this Gold & treaſour
               Perſauit the hole, and the Gold ſtollin away,
               He was ſorie, and wiſt not quhat to ſay.
               
                  
Into all haiſt paſt to the Empreour,
               And ſchew how theifis had ſtollin his greit trea ſour

               Quhen that this Knicht the Empreour ſa hard ſay

               And ſaw thair was na mater to debait,
               He vmbethocht him ſelf of ane conſait,
               Thinkand richt weill that thay wald cū agane

               Not lang efter as I befoir haue ſaid,
               This vther Knicht, quhen the Gold ſpendit had
               He and his Sone agane went to the Towre,
               To ſteill mair Gold than fra the Empreoure.
               Sa the Father firſt in the hole he went,
               And in the Twn he fell Incontinent.
               In to the nek, and thair ſtak as ane ſtane,
               Conſidderit weill that his Fortoun was gane.
               Said to his Sone cum thow fordwart no way,
               For at this time, I am tane for the pray.
               Cum thow fordwart thow ſall not faill to die,
               And nane of vs ane vther may ſupplie.
               Than ſaid the Sone, gif ȝe may not eſchaip,
               
                  
Than ar we baith but dout tane in the raip.
               God vs defend Father that ſa no be.
               Bot at this time ȝe get ſum help of me.
               And gif I nocht may help ȝow now my ſell,
               In haiſt I will baith help and ſeik counſell.
               The Father ſaid I ſe is na remeid,
               Bot with thy ſword thow mon ſtrike of my heid
               And quhen thay find my deid body heidles,
               Than ſall ȝe all of this ſchame be ſaikles.
               Sa nane ſall knaw quhat perſoun did this deid
               Nor in quhais breiſt this bargane did inbreid.
               Than ſaid the Sone now Father be the Rude,
               Zour counſall is baith honeſt Juſt and gude.
               For gif ſa chancit, in this caſe ȝe war knawin,

               Sa ſuld we not eſchaip the cruell deid,
               Sa I think beſt that I ſmite of ȝour heid.
               And euin with that, as he had ſaid the word,
               Out of the ſcheith anone he drew his ſword.
               His Fathers heid he hint of haiſtelie.
               And in ane gutter he keſt it neir hand by,
               Quhē this was done thā paſt he hame his way
               To his awin hous vnto his Siſteris tway.
               Schew thame the caſe, and all the mater haill.
               Quha ſair did weip priuelie and bewaill.
               Sone efter this the keipar of the Towre,

               Than in he come, and ſat doun on ane bink,

Than ſaid the Knicht I wait that can not be.

               Scho ſaid gude Lord I cry ȝow heir mercie,
               For it was I that cuttit doun the trie.

               To mak ȝow blyith, and to comfort ȝour fleſche
               That was the caus I gart this fire on mak,
               Onlie for ȝow, and for nane vthers ſaik.
               Quhen the Knicht hard it was the ſamin tre.
               Onto his wife he ſaid richt angerlie:

               Quhen that ſcho ſaw hir huſband diſcontent,

               And ȝe it takis agane ouir crabitlie.
               For I beleuit to win thairthrow gude deid

Nor for gude minde ſit outrage for to thoill.
               Than ſcho began to weip and mak murning,

               He was ſa heich and prydefull in his thocht,
               All vther men he ſet thame clene at nocht.
               This King he thocht all Rome for to deſtroy,
               The Romanis ſla, and efter to conuoy
               To his Kingdome, the deid banis of thir two,
               Peter and Paull, with mony Relicks mo.
               To waiſt that toun, and put it all to ſack,
               Bot his purpois was ſum thing put abak.
               Intill his face was ſa diſfigurait,
               In ſic ane ſort, that euerie kinde of ſtait,
               Abhorrit ſa, his vgſum foull viſage,
               That nane couet to tuitche his perſonage.
               Sa handillit was with ſic Infirmitie,
               With Lippernes, ane fouller nane culd be.
               Zit his nature rais on him with ſic rage,
               To haue wemen he gaue ane greit curage.
               Sa callit he his Steward quyetlie,
               And ſchew to him his counſall ſecreithe.
               Saying my freind, this thing I wil ȝow ſchaw
               All wemen kinde abhorris me as ȝe knaw,
               
                  
That I can get of thame na companie,
               Quhilk gif I had, war greit pleſure to me.
               He ſaid my Lord and pleis ȝour Nobill grace,
               Howbeit ȝe be deformit in the face:
               Ze haue aneuch of gude money and gold,
               For to conduce the faireſt on the Mold.
               Thairfoir I ſay ȝe neid not in na ſort
               Of fair wemen to wanc the greit comfort.
               Than ſaid the King ſe for na coiſt ȝe ſpair,
               To get me ane that is bricht freſche and fair:
               Howbeit ȝe gif ane thouſand Crownes thairfoir
               And or I want ȝe ſall gif mekill moir.
               The Stewart ſaid I ſall do that I may,
               To fill ȝour will, and ſa he come his way.
               Thinking in minde blindit with couetiſe
               Thir thouſand Crowns may I get on this wiſe
               Win to my ſell, and to my wife alone,
               And ſa hame wart to his wife is he gone.
               Quha was richt fair, bowſum with all bewtie,
               Verteous and gude, richt pleſand for to ſe,
               Prudent, perfite, with countenance richt glaid,
               With couetous hart to hir thir wordis he ſaid.
               O my gude wife, my Souerane Lord the King
               Hes chargeit me with ane richt ſecreit thing.
               To haue wemen he is richt couetous,
               At his pleſure, and wonder deſirous.
               Quhilks for na coiſt he ſayis he will not want,
               And charges me ane thouſand Crowns to grāt
               To ony perſoun that will the ſame reſſaue,
               Botfor ane nicht with him hir for to haue.
               Thairfoir in minde my ſelf I haue compeſt,
               Betuix vs twa, I think this be the beſt
               The thouſand Crowns to purches to our ſell.
               
                  
Sa ȝe will vſe, and follow my counſell.
               Scho ſaid gude Schir ȝour counſall I will do
               Sa to na ſin nor ſchame it turne me to.

               And thair all nicht ly with him quyetlie,
               At his pleſure, as he thinkis beſt to be.
               That it is ȝe, thair is na man ſall ken,
               Bot I alone, the quhilk abone all men

               Allace ſcho ſayis gude Schir is that ȝour will,
               By ȝour bodie, my womanheid to ſpill:
               With ane Lipper, and ſa deformit in face,
               Schir change ȝour minde for him that gaue all grace
               I wait it is nouther ȝour thocht nor mind

               O my gude wife howbeit he Lipper be

               And foull of fleſche, and alſo foull of blude,

               Wald ȝe that I committit ſic ane ſin,

               Incontinent without mair auyſing,
               With ſorie hart he ſaid vnto the King.

               Incontinent he paſt fra his preſence,
               And neuer ſaw the King fra that time hence.
               Quyte of his Realme fra thame he did him dres
               That Ilk rewaird he gat for gredynes.
               This being done, the King in all his dayis,

               Not regarding Goddis Law nor conſcience

Than ſaid the ſone Father remane a time,
               Quhill I reprufe hir of the cruell crime
               Scho laid on me, and falſlie on me brocht,

               Be ony way that culd deuiſit be.
               And that alone be the greit foirthocht feid
               Of the Emprice. Imagining my deid.
               That was the caus Father I durſt not ſpeik,

               Bot God is Juſt, howbeit he thoill a time,

               In time of derth, penuritie and ſkant,

               And left hir bird but help or ȝit reſkew.
               
                  
Still in the neſt quhilk thairfra culd not fle,
               Bot thair on force for to ly ſtill and die.
               Thairfoir the male thocht he had mair kindnes
               To the ȝoung Rauin, that in neid and diſtres
               Out of perrell it nureiſt and vpbrocht
               Nor the Female that flew and fed it nocht.
               Thairfoir the Male ſayis that he ſuld poſſeid
               His a win ȝoung bird that helpit it in neid.
               Rather than ſcho quhilk in neceſſitie,
               Left it alone but help in point to die.
               Than the Female alledgis this agane,
               That in the birth of hir bird had mair pane:
               Mair laubour, forrow, and penuritie,
               Mair hounger than the Male had be ſic thre.
               Thairfoir of him ſcho aucht to haue mair mirth
               That had of him ſit ſorrow in hir birth.
               For this Jikcaus my Soucrane Lord the King
               Thir Rauins cryis, and for nane vther thing.
               Deſiring ȝow to Judge be ȝour wiſdome,
               Quha this ȝoung bird ſall bruik in time to rum
               Thairfoir will ȝe on this thing giue ſentence.
               Thay will na mair cum in ȝour grace preſence
               Than ſaid the King becaus that the Female
               Left hir aidin bird into ſit neid and bale,
               And in na fort wald nureis it nor feid,
               Bot fra it fied quhen that it had maiſt neid.
               I think alwayis with reſſoun it ſuld ſtand,
               The bird ſuld be at bidding and commaud:
               With the Male Kauin, and in his companie,
               Becaus he fed it in neceſſitie.
               And quhair that ſcho alledges hir agane
               To haue mair ſturt, ſorrow trauell and pane
               In his clekking, furth bringing and his birth,
               
                  
I ſay to ȝow all that was turnit in mirth,
               Sa ſone as ſcho hir a win bird quick culd ſe,
               Scho quyte forȝet hir greit aduerſitie,

               And Inſtrument of all generatioun,
               I ſay alſo in time of hir greit neid,
               He did his bird with pane nureis and feid:
               Quhen the Female it left into the neſt,
               In greit hounger, and als with cald oppreſt.
               Thairfoir I giue diffinitiue ſentence,
               That the Male Rauin ſal ay haue ſtill preſence

               Of the ȝoung bird, quhair euer he gang or fle.
               And the Female his fellowſchip ſall want it,

               This being done, in ſchort time efter than,

               Quhen the Empreour this tail hard til him cald
               Into his minde was muifit monyfaid.
               In that ſame time Lodwik come throw yt hall,
               And vpon him the Empreour ſone did call.

Quhilk I ſall preif on him in plane battail:
               On his bodie and thairaf ſall I ſtand,
               Defend it now, gif thow dar tak on hand.

               Of hir Father, in oppin audience.
               And how that he aſſignit the fechting day,
               And vnto hir in this maner can ſay.
               Now Florentine my Ladie fair and gent,
               It me behuifis to wirk with auiſement:
               With ȝow alwayis for ſa the mater ſtandis.
               I can not chaip vndeid of Gwydois handis.
               For quhy gif I had nayit to him battall
               Than had I ȝald my ſelf all criminall.
               And of the crime grantit my ſelf gyltie,
               Thairfoir forte was to counterfute mellie.
               Alſwa Gwydo is wonder ſtout and ſtrang.
               In fait of armes he hes bene vſit lang.
               
                  
I neuer knew in na companie heir,
               Bot Alexander to fecht can be his peir.
               For I am waik and febill of perſoun,
               And to his ſtrenth hes na compariſoun.
               Gif I him meit in feild quhat ſalbe than,
               Without refuge I am bot ane deid man.
               And ſa on me ſall ly the caus and blame,
               And ȝe for ay ſall thoill ſclander and ſchame.
               Than Florentine to Lodwik this can ſay.
               Sen ſic ane chance is cum betuix vs tway.
               And I feill ȝow diſpairit in ane part.
               And in this cace ouir waik ſpretit in hart.
               Zit not the les quhair twa Illis dois approche
               I think it beſt fra the greiteſt to foche.
               The firſt Ill is, fra ȝe ȝow gyltie grant,
               Than ſal I ay baith welth and worſchip want
               And ȝe alſo be put to cruell deid,
               And I for ay my life in langour leid.
               The ſecund is, gif ȝe to battell boun,
               Ze ar ſa waik and febill of perſoun.
               And Gwydo is ſa ſtrang and als hardie,
               That ȝe dow not ganeſtand him ſtraikis thre.
               And ſa alwayis I can find na remeid,
               How euer it go thair is to ȝow bot deid.
               Thairfoir heirin ȝe ſall my counſall do,
               Ze ſall but let my Father ſone pas to:
               And ſchaw to him on ȝour maiſt humbill wiſe,
               That ȝour Father vpon his deid bed lyis.
               Quhairof thair is new writings cum ȝow till,
               Deſiring him, gif that it be his will:

               And in meane time with ȝour Father to ſpeik.
               
                  
Be the reſſoun he lyis ſa wonder ſeik.
               And for to ken his perfite latter will,
               That in all pointis the ſame ȝe may fulfill.
               And for to ſpeik with him twa wordis or thre,
               Furth of this warld or he depart and die.
               And that ȝe may his benneſoun obtene,
               With his awin mouth, ſine ȝe to lowk his ene.
               And quhen ȝe haue obtenit his licence,
               To Alexander in all gude haiſt pas hence.
               And ſecreitlie to him the mater ſchaw,
               How all thing ſtandis, perfitelie let him knaw
               And him require into this extreme cace,
               That he wald cum and to ſupplie ȝour place.
               Contrair Gwydo, with him in battell fecht,
               Becaus ȝour ſelf to do the ſame hes hecht.
               This counſall than it pleſit Lodwik weill,
               Euin as ſcho ſaid, ſa did he euerie deill.
               Licence obtenit, and als prolongit the day,
               To Alexander Lodwik tuik his Jornay.
               Small reſt he tuik, bot raid on day and nicht

               Quhen the King gat of Lodwik knawlegeing
