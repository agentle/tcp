                     RIGHT HONORABLE:
                  
                  AS the God of Nature hath Decked that Great Man the World with diuers ornaments, it being in nothing more admirable then in variety; so hath the same God inriched that little World Man, with sundry endowments, he being in nothing more profitable to the Church, then in Diuersity: For to some he hath giuen to be Apostles, to others to

                     be Prophets, to others to be Teachers; and all this for the gathering together of the Saints, for the workes of the Ministry, for the building vp of the body of Christ. So

                     that wherein one is Defectiue, another is Excellent, that the Church of Christ may bee perfectly instructed in all things, by the mutuall labours of each fellow member.
                  
                  
                     Hence it comes to passe that some men abound with variety of Tongues; others with interpretation of Languages, some with the smoothnes of Doctrine, and others are acquainted with the knotty study of Polemicall Theologie: there being nothing commodious for that Mysticall body of Christ, which cannot be supplied by one member or other. And albeit this renowned Kingdome of great Britaine flowes with multitudes of most pregnant wits, (as once did Canaan with

                        , hoping my labours (albeit vnpollished with Eligancy of stile) shall not bee altogether vnprofitable to the Church. The insolency of the Romish Foxes, (as in all places of this Land, so more especially) in those parts, where your

                     hath Command and Mansion, and my selfe Residence

                     and Imployment, hath forced me to the search of this subiect. The setling of weake, and confirmation of sound Protestants, hath pressed it to the Presse. The bonds of Respect and Duty, wherein I am obliged vnto your Honor, bind both my selfe, and it vnto your Noble Selfe; vnto whose Patronage I Commend it, and vnder whose Name I commit it to the wide World.
                  
                     The Motiues that induce me to Dedicate this small Treatise to your Honor, are.
                  
                  
                     First the Externall Nobility of your Birth, being so Noble a Branch, equally springing from two Illustrious Stems. Secondly, the Internall Nobility of your Grace, manifested by your so sincere affection to Religion, wherein with Timothy, your Honour hath beene instructed from your Child-hood; and to the true Professours whereof, your Lordship hath vouchsafed alwayes a gracious countenance. Thirdly, your purpose to visite other Kingdomes abroad; where doubtlesse occasion will be offered vnto your Lordship, to maintaine that Truth wherein you haue beene bred, and to oppose that Falshood which you cannot but detest. 
                           〈◊〉
                        I presumed to preferre this part of my
                     
studies, vnto your Honorable Patronage, that it might remaine with your Honor as an Antidote against the Poyson of Popery, and Infection of the Romish Locusts. Lastly, that hereby I might render vnto your Honor some testimonie of thankfulnesse, for those manie vndeserued Fauours, which Your Lordship hath beene pleased to conferre vppon mee; that as I remaine bound vnto Your Honor for euer: So heereby I might free my selfe from the staine of Ingratitude.
                  
                  Accept therefore, (I most humbly beseech your Honor) this pleadge of his vnfained thankfulnesse, who shall continually pray to God to blesse your Lordshippe with aboundance of Honor, Wealth, Grace, Prosperity in this World, and the full Fruition of Eternall Glory in the World to come,

                  To the Christian Reader.
                  CHristian Reader, the audacious and frequent practise of the Masse-Priests, in offering their blasphemous Sacrifice; with the vnsufferable impudency of the Romish Laity, both in conference to iustifie, and by presence to communicate therein; (more especially in our Northerne parts, where I am Resident) hath constrained me to wade into this abstruse Mystery, not intending to make it the Worlds common obiect; (as may appeare by the stile,) but rather to furnish my selfe with Defensiue and Offensiue armour; matter of answer and opposition in case of encounter. What intention had vowed mine owne, intreaty of Friends, and desire of the Common good, hath made thine. If thou know the Author, censure not his youth (seeing the scantinesse of yeares is supplied by the largnesse of Industry) but if thou finde any fruite worth gathering, taste it thankfully, rendring God the glory, me thy Prayers. The solidity of the matter I hope, thou canst not impeach; the plainnesse vsed in Penning, with the Faults escaped in Printing, I hope thou wilt winke at, Iudge me
                  
                     Thine in any Christian seruice:

                     What's become of all those Christs the Priests haue made?
                     Do those hoasts of Hosts abide? or doe they fade?
                     One Christ abides, but all those flie;
                     One Christ liues, but all those die;
                     One is true, the rest a lie.
                  
               
            
            
               
                  
                  MELCHIZEDECHS Antitype. Or The eternall Priesthood and All sufficient sacrifice of Christ.
                  Hebr- 10. 12.
                  But he hauing offred one Sacrifice for sinne, sitteth for euer at the right hand of God.
                  THe Authour of this Epistle writing 
                        Caluine in the argument of this Epistle. vnto the beleeuing Iewes which had receiued the doctrine of Christ, intends not to persuade them that Iesus was the Messiah foretolde by the Prophets to bee the Sauiour of the world, for of this they were already satisfied: but his scope and intent is rather more fully to informe them concerning the offices of Christ, which

he prooues largely and exactly to be three: Propheticall, Kingly, and Priestly. These hee layes downe generally in the three first verses of this Epistle. For Chap. 1. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 1, 2. first hee shewes that whereas the Lord had spoken obscurely and vmbratically by his Prophets touching the Christ, yet now hee spake personally by his Sonne, who was the Messiah himselfe and the great Prophet of his Church. Secondly, he shewes that Vers. 2. 3. 
                     Iesus was our Lord and King appointed by his father as heire of all things, by whom he made the world; in whom alone the glorie and maiesty of the father is to be contemplated, who sustaineth all things by his mightie word, each creature obeying his command. Thirdly, that the same Iesus the sonne of God was the Priest which offered that all-sufficient sacrifice Vers. 3. for remission of the sinnes of all that beleeue in him.
                  Thus the Authour hauing layd the ground worke of his subsequent matter doth in the sequell of the Epistle polish euery particular part with sundry arguments, still building vpon that foundation which he had laid. But because the Iewes thought it strange that the Gospell should take place, and be preferred before the Law, therefore the Authour first declares 
                        
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . the excellency of Iesus Christ shewing him to be not onely man but God, farre aboue all Angells, and consequently worthy of a great deale more honour then Moses.
                  
                  Hauing handled his Propheticall and Regall offices, hee comes in the fourteenth verse of the fourth The difference between Christ and 
                           〈◊〉
                        . chapter to his Priestly office; and comparing him with Aaron, layes downe diuers differences betweene

                     Christ and Aaron; who differed:
                  First in person, the one being onely man, the other as well God as man.
                  Secondly in qualitie, the one being sinnefull, offered sacrifice, not onely for others but for himselfe also; the other being Choris hamartias, without sinne offered himselfe for vs.
                  
                  Thirdly in order; the one being of the Leuiticall order; the other after the order of Melchisedech; and consequently the one was temporarie; the other eternall.
                  Fourthly in the manner of sacrificing; Aaron offered the blood of beasts, but Christ offered himselfe, yea his owne blood.
                  Fiftly in efficacie; the sacrifices of Aaron being in themselues of no vertue, not able to cleanse sinne: but the sacrifice of Christ was effectuall purging all beleeuers from all their sinnes.
                  Sixthly in the reiteration; for Aaron and his sons were bound to reiterate their sacrifices euery day: Christ offered once for all.
                  
                  Seauenthly, Aaron entred into an earthly tabernacle without the people, but Christ into a heauenly with all his faithfull members.
                  Then the Apostle shewes what Analogie and proportion The agreement between Christ and Aaron.
                      there was betweene the Priest-hood of Christ, and that of Aaron; which agreed.
                  First in election, for as the Leuiticall Priests were elected to their office: so was Christ ordained of his Father.
                  Secondly, they did offer sacrifice with blood, so did Christ.
                  
                  
                     
Thirdly, they did it in behalfe of the people, so did Christ.
                  
                  Fourthly, they prayed for the people, so did Christ.
                  
                  Last'y, they entred into the Sanctum Sanctorum, Holy of Holyes; so did Christ.
                  The Authour in the ninth chapter hauing compared the carnall rites with the spirituall; the 
                        〈◊〉
                     Tabernacle which was corruptible; with the glorious tabernacle of Christs humane nature which was and is incorruptible; the blood of beasts with the blood of Christ; shewing that these were but the shadowes, whereof Christ was the substance, in whom we inioy all things spiritually, and by whose blood al things are sanctified vnto vs: in this chapter he shewes the insufficiencie of the Leuiticall oblations to be imployed by their frequent reiteration, and the perfection of Christs sacrifice by the single act: wherefore the Hebrewes should not rest in the Leuiticall sacrifices, which being types of Christ had their perfection in him, who hauing offered one sacrifice for sinne, sitteth for euer at the right hand of God.
                  
                  This text doth diuide it selfe into two parts. The text diuided.
                  
                  An Agent and his Actions.
                  The Agent in this relatiue pronoune, Autos, He.
                  
                  His Actions are two. The first done and past. The second present and in doing. The first, hee offered one sacrifice for sinne, where we haue.
                  First the subiect of his action, He offered a sacrifice.
                  
                  
                     
Secondly, the singularitie of this subiect. One sacrifice.
                  
                  Thirdly, the end of both; for finne.
                  
                  His second action is expressed by three predicaments.
                  Situs. His gesture He sitteth.
                  Vbi, His place, at the right hand of God.
                  
                     Quando. His time; how long, for euer.
                  
                  In the first is intimated his Maiestie; in that hee sitteth.
                  
                  In the second his Omnipotencie, at the right hand of God.
                  
                  In the third his Eternitie; in that hee sitteth for euer.
                  
                  In the first action you haue Christ in the state of humiliation. In the second in the state of exaltation. In the first he is dying for sinne; in the second 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     ouer sinne. And first of the first, Hee hauing offered one sacrifice for sinne.
                  
                  In the handling of which words this Method shal be obserued.
                  First I shall shew who was the Priest that offered. Secondly, what was the sacrifice which was offered. Thirdly, the scope and end whereunto it was directed.
                  
                  This Priest was Christ, the eternall sonne of God, one with the Father, 
                        〈◊〉
                     of all things, and by whom all things doe subsist, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, a perfect man without sinne, full of grace and truth. He it was that tooke vpon him this function to be a Priest, and to offer an all-sufficient sacrifice to expiate for the sinnes of the elect. And herein did Christ 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      mainely differ from the Leuiticall Priests

in that they were onely the persons offering sacrifice, and not the sacrifice it selfe; but Christ was both the Christ both Priest and sacrifice. Priest and Sacrifice: for there could no sufficient sacrifice bee found for the sinne of man, but onely Christ; and none worthy to offer the sonne of God, but onely himselfe.
                  But seeing Christ in the vnitie of his person had entertained a dualitie of natures, consisting of Deitie and Humanitie, hence arises a question.
                  Whether the Priestly office of Christ belong vnto Quest. Answ. his Godhead or to his manhood, or to both? The answer is, that Christ is this Priest according to neither nature separately or diuided, but according to both natures ioyntly, as he was both God and man. See this confirmed, How much more shall the blood of 
                     Heb. 9. 14. 
                     Christ who by the eternall spirit, offered himselfe to God, purge our consciences from dead works to serue the liuing God. By which eternall spirit we are to vnderstand his eternall Godhead, concurring with his manhood to make him a perfect Priest. Why Christ as Priest was to be God end man.
                  
                  The reasons why the Priestly office of Christ did require that he should be both God and man are these. First as he was a Priest, so was he to be a Mediatour; but he could not be a Mediatour except he were God and man; for Opera Christi Mediatoris sunt The andrica: The workes of Christ which concerne his Mediatourship 
                     
                        
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . 
                     proceede from both natures.
                  
                  Secondly, because he was to be a Priest after the order of Melchisedech, so that he must bee apator and 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      
                     ametor, without father, without mother, as Melchisedech was. Now he was not without father but as hee was man, nor without mother but as he was God.
                  
                     
Thirdly, because hee must be both God and man that reconciled in one God vnto man, and man vnto God.
                  Lastly, because no creature could satisfie Gods 
                        〈◊〉
                     but onely God, none ought but onely man; wherefore the Godhead of Christ did giue unto his manhood efficacie and merit to deserue at Gods hands remission of our sinnes: for the manhood of it selfe without the Godhead hath no vertue or efficacie to be meritorious; So it appeares that Christ Iesus was the High Priest for his elect, according to both natures:
                  Concerning the Priesthood of Christ there are three things obseruable.
                  First, that albeit Christ was a Priest, yet he did not arise out of the Priestly stocke of Aaron, he was not of the tribe of Leui, but of the Princely stocke of Why Christ did not arise out of the Priestly stocke of Aaron.
                      
                     Dauid, being borne of the tribe of Iudah, aud that for these two reasons.
                  First, to shew that hee was not a Priest after the order of Aaron, but of a new order differing from the Leuiticall as the Anti-type from the Type, the true Priesthood from the figuratiue.
                  Secondly, he arose of the Regall tribe of Iudah, that so like Melchisedech hee might bee not onely a Priest but a King, Yet notwithstanding in the priesthood of Aaron there were many resemblances of Christs Priesthood 1. In that the high Priest was annoynted with oyle, so was Christ spiritually: God 
                     Psal 45. 7. 
                     euen thy God hath annointed thee with the oyle of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes. 2. In the sumptuous apparrell which the high Priest put on: a type of the rich

and 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      of 
                        〈◊◊〉
                     . 3. In the speciall parts of the high Priests attire; as the Ephod, the shoulders whereof had two Onix stones whereon were engrauen the names of the twelue tribes; to represent Christs carrying all the elect on his shoulders; supporting them in this life against the world, the flesh, and the diuell. Next the brestplate of iudgement wherin were set twelue stones hauing engrauen on them the names of the 12. tribes of Israel; and with these did he appeare before God in the Sanctuarie; representing thereby that Iesus our High Priest being in his heauenly Sanctuarie, beares in memorie all the elect before God; and vpon this ground the Church in the Canticles prayes that she 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        8.6. might bee set as a seale vpon his heart, and as a seale vpon his arme. Then the Vrim and Thummim; the first whereof signifies Lights, the second Perfections; Col. 23. representing in Christ. 1. The light of wisedome, for in him are hid all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge. 2. His perfection, wherein he excelleth all creatures. Lastly, the Priest had a plate on his forehead whereon was engrauen Holinesse to Iehouah; representing the holines of Christ wherewith he doth appeare before his father for the redemption of his people.
                  In the second place we are to obscrue the eternity Christs priesthood how 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 110.4. of Christs Priesthood; for it is saide, Thou art Priest for euer after the order of Melchisedech. Now the Priesthood of Christ is said to bee eternall, not that Christ shall for euer offer sacrifice for the sinnes of his people; but that the vertue and efficacie of his sacrifice doth extend it selfe vnto eternity in the

saluation of all beleeuers: in that by the merit of this oblation of his death and passion hee hath purchased for all his members eternall glorie. So that the eternitie of Christs Priesthood consists not in the continuation of his Sacerdotall acts, but in the eternall effect of his sacrifice vpon the elect. For when Christ shall at the last day iudge the world, and shall inuest the soules and bodies of all his Saints with glory and immortalitie, then shall cease the Propheticall, and Priestly offices of Christ, and onely his Regall or Kingly office shall remaine: for the Saints in glorie shall haue perfect knowledge, and shall need no information from him as a Prophet; nor shall neede the sacrifice or intercession of Christ as a Priest, but shall yeeld all obedience in thought, word, and deede vnto him as their King.
                  
                     Quest. But how can the sacrifice of Christ beeing (but finite and temporarie) be of infinite and eternall merit?
                  
                     Ans. The act of Christ vpon the orosse, offering himselfe a sacrifice for the sinnes of his Saints was a finite act, and temporarie, lasting but some certaine houres, and so consequently could not be of it selfe of 
                        〈◊〉
                     and eternall vertue: but if we consider that with his manhood there was inseparably vnited his Godhead which was of eternall and infinite efficacie; and Christs sacrifice was accepted of his father, not Math. 3 17. onely as the sacrifice of the sonne of man, but also as the sacrifice of the Sonne of God his onely begotten Son, then we mustneedes confesse the sacrifice of Christ to be of infinite and eternall merit. Here then is the solution of this doubt. Albeit the Manhood of Christ

onely was the sacrifice for our finnes which did satisfie Gods wrath, yet the Manhood of Christ alone was not sufficient: for the Dietie must concurre (though not in suffering) yet in giuing vertue, power, and officacie to merite eternall life at the hands of God.
                  Thirdly, wee are to obserue the parts of Christs Priesthood which are two.
                  First, Satisfaction or Expiation for our sinnes, 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      whereby Christ hath payd the price for our iniquities, and hath giuen himselfe an all-sufficient ransome for vs. From which satisfaction ariseth our reconciliation whereby God is well pleased with vs in his 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and wee in Christ are made the Sonnes of God.
                  
                  Secondly, 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , and that consists of two 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      things.
                  First, in that he makes request for vs before his father, not that he doth kneele before him to pray for 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      vs, but that hee doth continually and incessantly appeare before him by the merit of his righteousnesse making intercession for vs: for as Christ did vnite his eternall righteousnesse vnto his humane nature at his birth, and continued it vntill his death; so his humane nature endued with perfect righteousnesse appeares before God the Father in heauen after an ineffable manner making request for vs.
                  Secondly, in that hee doth offer our prayers and thanks giuings to God, making them acceptable in 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      himselfe, Christ is that Angell spoken of by S. Iohn, The golden altar is his Godhead, signifying Purity and Merit, his incense is his righteousnesse, which beeing

                     an offering of a sweet smelling sauour in the nostrills of his Father, makes the prayers of the Saints acceptable to the father.
                  These things being thus made plaine touching the 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      Priesthood of Christ, the Thesis or point of Doctrine followes, That there neuer was, nor euer shall be any Priest that could or shall hereafter offer a perfect satisfactorie sacrifice for the sinnes of the redeemed, but onely Christ Iesus the son of God. For if any creatures could haue satisfied for the sin of man, and reconciled him vnto God, he would neuer haue layd so heauy a burthen vpon his onely Son, as to endure the shame of cursed Iewes, and (which was tenne thousand times more) the infinite wrath of his heauenly Father for the transgressions of mankind. And indeede Christ onely was sufficient for this office if we consider these particulars.
                  First, he that was to offer such a sacrifice must bee Reas. 1.
                      God and man, after the order of Melchizedech, without father, without mother; which should be King of Salem, and authour of eternall peace; who was so but onely Christ?
                  Secondly, hee that offered such a sacrifice was of Reas. 2.
                      no lesse worth, merit, aud dignity with God then the sacrifice it selfe; seeing (as Ireneus speakes) The sacrifice receiues its efficacy and value from the Priest that offers it.
                  
                  Wherefore the sacrifice that was offered for the sinnes of man, beeing of infinite worth and excellencie, according as the sinne of man was of infinite deformitie, and deserued infinite punishment; so must the Priest likewise bee of infinite desert at the hands

of God that must offer so great a sacrifice. Hereupon it followes that the humane nature of Christ beeing perfectly holy of it selfe, yet not infinitely holy, could neuer haue beene a sufficient sacrifice for our sinnes, had not the Dietie beene vnited to it, so to make him an infinite Priest, that hee might giue infinite merite and efficacie to his oblation. But a creature of infinit desert could not be found. Not Angels who are finite in being, and whose holinesse is but deriued from God, his Sanctitie being the fountaine and theirs the streames. 
                        〈◊〉
                     man for he had corrupted his wayes, and was become abhominable, and had neede of a Mediatour to stand betweene God and himselfe. None there for was sufficient for this function, none worthy of this Priesthood but Christ Iesus the Sonne of God.
                  
                  By the ground of this reason, wee may obserue a Differences betweene a sacrifice aud a Sacrament. 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           
                         in 5. cap. 
                        
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . maine difference betweene a Sacrifice and a Sacrament: a Sacrament doth not receiue it efficacie and vertue from the minister, but may be administred effectually to a beleeuer, albeit it be by a wicked Minister; but a sacrifice is either accepted or reiected for the worthinesse or vnworthinesse of the person 
                        〈◊〉
                     . As appeares euidently in Cain and Abel, their 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 4. sacrifices both sufficient for matter, but God imbraced Abels, because he offered with a righteous heart, and abhominated Cains, because he was wicked. The people of 
                        〈◊〉
                     and Iudah because their 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        was full 
                     
                        
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . 
                     of blood, and their hearts full of 
                        〈◊〉
                     , therefore were 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     sacrifices an abhomination vnto the Lord, 
                        
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . and for their wickednes did the Lord 
                        〈◊〉
                     his owne ordinances.
                  
                     
The third reason why Christ onely is that Priest who can offer a perfect propitiatorie sacrifice for the sinnes of mankind, is because he that offered that oblation 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 7. 3. was to haue neither archen emeron, nor zoes telos, beginning of dayes, nor end of life; but what creature is there which was not framed in time by the God of eternity; seeing in the beginning God made the 
                     Gen. 1. 1. 
                     heauen and the earth, and all things therein, where then shall we find any Priest to parallell eternity, but onely Christ Iesus the Sonne of God.
                  
                  Fourthly, there was and is but one Mediatour betweene 
                     
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      
                     God and man, which was the office of the Priest, but this Mediatour is onely Christ Iesus. For albeit there bee appointed ministers of Gods holy word to present the prayers of the faithfull before God, and to impetrate for them, yet this is not for the worthinesse of their owne persons and in their owne names, but in the name and for the 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      of Christ do they make request for the whole Church of Christ. And to this purpose Saint 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     in these words, If the Apostle had

                        These 
                     
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      
                     things haue I written vnto you, that you should

                         by my prayer obtaine pardon for your sinnes (
                        〈◊◊〉
                      
                     placeth the Bishop to be a Mediatour betweene God and the people) what good or faithfull Christian 
                           〈◊〉
                        abide him, who would behold him as the Apostle of Christ, and not rather as Antichrist? By which words of Saint Augustine, it appeares to be a point of 
                        〈◊〉
                     to place any creature as a 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      God and man, but onely hee who 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      God and man Christ Iesus.
                  
                     
Fiftly and lastly there is but one that could offer this Sacrifice, because as the Priesthood was peculiar to Christ alone, so the act of offering this sacrifice according to the order of that Priesthood did properly and personally appertaine to Christ. Now Christ had such a Priesthood as no creature was capable of, and therefore the Apostle cals it aparabaton ierosunen, 
                     
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      such a priesthood as could not passe from him to any other creature, no not to the father or the holy Ghost; therefore was it translated from Aarons order to Christ, where it resteth, and from whom it cannot be translated or remooued by succession, or any other wayes; and seeing he hath translated the Leuiticall Priesthood, and bound it to his owne person, hee hath thereby made the new Testament vnalterable, and his priesthood vnchangeable. Wherefore seeing there is but one onely that is God and man, after the order of Melchisedech, without father, without mother, king of Salem and Prince of Peace. Seeing there is but one that is of equall dignitie, with this all-sufficient sacrifice. Seeing there is but one that hath neyther beginning nor end of dayes. Seeing there is but one Mediatour betweene God and man. And seeing the priesthood was tyed to one particular person, and all these agree onely vnto Christ; it followes therefore that there is but one onely priest who was worthie and able to offer this perfect satisfactorie sacrifice; and that was Iesus Christ.
                  The first vse of this point is for confutation of the 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      doctrine of the Church of Rome; for you haue heard that Christ is Priest not according to his humane nature onely but also according to his diuine,

which the papists veterly deny; making him to bee a 
                        Fulke on the 5. Heb ver. 6. priest onely as he was man; but altogether vniustly; for in the office of priesthood there are two things necessarie. Ministerie and Authoritie. In respect of the Ministeriall part Christ performed that office as man; but in respect of Authoritie of entring into the Holy of Holyes, and presenting vs before God and reconciling vs vnto him, which was the principall part of his priesthood, he did performe it as the Sonne of God; as the second person in the Trinitie, co-worker with the Father in the creation of the world: wherefore that he might be a priest able and worthy to make attonement with God he was God; that his reconciliation might extend to men, he was man; and so being God and man he is a perfect mediatour between God and man; and an high Priest for euer after the order of Melchizedech.
                  
                  But the Papists hold Christ to bee a Priest onely in Obiect. his humane nature, because they thinke that onely in his humane nature he was annoynted.
                  I answer, that if this annoynting be onely taken for

                      the collation of the gifts and graces of the Spirit; it is true, onely the humane nature of Christ was annointed. But by this annointing is also vnderstood the ordaining of Christ to be the Mediatour and Sauiour of the world, and in this sence not onely his humane nature but also his diuine was annoynted to this end. For the humane nature of Christ albeit it was pure and spotlesse, yet could it neuer haue wrought our redemption without the assistance of his Godhead, for as he was man, so he was borne, hee fasted, he suffered, he dyed; but to rise from the graue,

                  Secondly, seeing Christ onely is that Priest that can offer an al-sufficient sacrifice for the sinnes of his Vse 2.
                      elect, this then demonstrateth the sacrilegious blasphemie of the Romish Priesthood, that they dare presume to arrogate that office to themselues, which is onely peculiar to Iesus Christ How dare such presumptuous priests once vndertake to offer a sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead, seeing the offering of that sacrifice caused the Sonne of God to sweat clods of water and blood, to endure the infinite wrath of his infinite father, and had he not beene corroborated by the dietie, his body had beene vanquished by death, and captiuated by the power of the graue; if the Sonne of God could not do it but with so much difficultie; proud are the sonnes of 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      the Priests of Rome, who seeme to doe it with such facilitie. But I would argue Socratically with them by demanding some questions.
                  1. First, he that was to offer this sacrifice was to

be God and man without sinne: I demaund whether any of them be God and man; if not then they cannot offer this satisfactorie sacrifice, neither are they after the order of Melchizedech. If they say that euery one of their priests is God and man, oh how doe they blaspheme? how doe they proclaime themselues of the spawne of Antichrist? who takes vpon him to be God, and exalts himselfe aboue all that are 
                     2. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 2. 4. 
                     called Gods.
                  
                  2. Secondly, the Angell told Daniell, Dan. 9. that Christ should take away sinne by his sacrifice, and the Eph. 5. 2. holy Apostle sayes, Christ offered himselfe an oblation and sacrifice to God of a sweet smelling sauour. So that this sacrifice could be offered of none but Christ. Are they so many Christs?
                  3. Thirdly, there was but one high Priest at once among the Iewes, to signifie that there was but one high Priest that could take away our sinnes by offering a satisfactory sacrifice. But are not they innumerable?
                  4. Fourthly, hee that offered this sacrifice was to be of no lesse dignitie and worth then the sacrifice it selfe, seeing a sacrifice is accepted for his sake that offers it. But dares the masse priest say he is himselfe of equall dignitie with the sacrifice he offers: or that it is accepted for his sake? No not for his eares.
                  Lastly the sacrifice that the Priest offers in the masse, either is the same that Christ offered or another; if it be another, then it is not propitiatory, seeing the true satisfactory sacrifice was but one according to the text, hauing offered one sacrifice. If it be the same, why then doe they make the sacrifice of Christ imperfect

and weake by their so often reiteration; yea, why doe they make the Scripture false which sayes,, Hauing offered one sacrifice once for all. And as the Leuiticall sacrifices being so frequently repeated did shew that they were in themselues imperfect, and could neuer 
                     Heb. 10. 1. 
                     make the commers hereunto perfect; so doth the often repetition of the sacrifice of Christ argue the imbecility thereof.
                  
                     Obiect. But the factors of the Church of Rome will say, that Christ may haue deputies on earth in his stead to offer sacrifice.
                  
                     Ans. I answer hereunto two wayes. First, I say Christ is not bound to offer any more sacrifice at all; for the oblation of himselfe vpon the crosse did consummate mans redemption, and put an end 
                        〈◊〉
                     all typical sacrifices of the law, and to his sacrifice which he was to offer for mans reconciliation? wherefore seeing Christ is not to offer any more sacrifice, what needes he a deputie to offer sacrifices, where neither seruice is required nor expected, what need is there of a substitute?
                  2. I answer by the way of admission; let vs grant that Christ is yet to offer sacrifice, or to continue his begunne sacrifice, which is most erroneous. Yet we must consider Christ two wayes. 1. as God. 2. as a Mediatour. As hee is God with the Father, and the holy Ghost, he hath Kings and Magistrates to bee his deputies on earth: therefore they are called Elohim Gods. But as he is a Mediatour he hath neither deputie nor vicegerent, neither king to rule ouer his Church, nor priest to offer sacrifice for him.
                  
                     Quest. If they aske what wee doe then with Ministers

in the Church of England?
                  
                     Answ. I answer, wee make them not Mediatours and sacrificing priests (as Parmenian the heretick and the papists doe) but we haue them for such purposes as Christ hath commanded, namely, to administer the word and sacraments, to vse prayer and discipline in the Church, which is no part of the office of Christs eternall priesthood, or chiefe sacrificers dignity,
                  Plainely then doe appeare vnto vs the blasphemie and sacriledge of the Priests of Rome in establishing their massing priesthood, for while they seeke to maintaine their owne glory, they robbe Christ of his; endeauouring to confirme the multiplicity of their priests, they ouerthrow the singular priesthood of 
                        〈◊〉
                     Christ.
                  
                     Quest. But heere may bee demanded a question whether the title priest may properly be assigned to a Minister of the new Testament?
                  
                     Answ. I answer, howsoeuer it bee crept into the Church, yet (as learned Fulke) it is not a proper title for the ministers of the Gospell, in regard, that wee haue but one Priest Iesus Christ; for the office of the Priest is to offer sacrifice which doth not appertaine to the ministers of Christ Iesus, neither is the name priest any where in the new Testament ascribed vnto the Ministers in respect of their office.
                  But how then shal we answer to that place of Paul, 
                     Rom. 15. 16. 
                     That I should be the Minister of Iesus Christ, to the Gentiles ministring the Gospell of God, that the offering vp of the Gentiles might be acceptable beeing sanctified through the Holy Ghost. Where the word 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        to 
                           〈◊〉
                        ; ministring the Gospell, signifies as much

as sacrificing the Gospell; and so Erasmus translates it, explained by the word following, namely, that the offering of the Gentiles; where it appeares that a sacerdotall action is attributed vnto Paul, being a minister of the Gospell; and therefore that the title priest may as lawfully and conueniently be ascribed to him. So Origen, Sacrificale opus est 
                           〈◊〉
                        Euangelium, It is a sacrificall worke to preach the Gospel. 
                     Origen, in epist. ad Rom. lib. 16. 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . I answer vnto the place alleadged out of the Romans (as Caluin on the place) that the Apostle speakes there Metaphoricall alluding to the priesthood of Aaron and the Leuiticall oblations, that as the priest did offer the oblation that was brought vnto him vnto the Lord: so Paul had a carefull desire by the preaching of the Gospell to subdue the affections of the Gentiles, and so to offer them (as it were) a pure and acceptable sacrifice vnto God. So Origen and other of the fathers tearme the preaching of the Gospell a priestly or sacrificall worke; not absolutely but comparatiuely and by way of similitude.
                  
                     Obiect. But here may bee obiected these testimonies of Scripture, 1. Pet. 2. 5. 9. Reu. 1. 6. Reu. 20. 6. by which place it appeares that there are priests of the new Testament which ought still to offer sacrifice vnto God.
                  
                     Answ. Vnto these places I answer, that if you consider who these are that are here spoken of, you shall finde them not to be onely the Clergie, but all faithfull Christians which haue not a materiall or externall priesthood but a spirituall and an internall, and so they doe offer spirituall sacrifices as I shall

shew when I come to speake of the sacrifice that Christ offered. So that these places of scripture doe prooue the 
                        〈◊〉
                     priesthood not to bee lawfull, nor the title of priest properly to appertaine to the ministers of the Gospell, but onely that all Christians should be spirituall priests to offer spirituall sacrifice to God.
                  The third and last vse of this point, is that which Vse 3.
                      the Apostle makes, Seeing wee haue not a high Priest, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our in 
                           〈◊〉
                        : but was in all points tempted like as we are, without sinne: let vs therefore come boldlie vnto the throne 
                     Hebt 4. 15. 16. Heb. 10. 19. 20. 21. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 
                     of grace, that we may obtaine mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of need: and againe, Hauing therefore, brethren, boldnesse to enter into the Holyest by the blood of Iesus; By a new and lining way which he hath consecrated for vs, through the raile, that is to say, His flesh: And hauing an high Priest ouer the house of God: Let vs draw neere with a true heart in full assurance of faith, hauing our hearts sprinkled from an euill conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Seeing Christ Iesus whom the Father had deereed from all eternity, did from euerlasting giue himselfe a Sacrifice for our transgressions, and when the fulnesse of time was come, by vertue of his priesthood did offer vp himselfe and offering of a sweet smelling sauour vnto God for vs; Oh then let vs with wonder admire the infinite oue of God that spared not his owne sonne; the infinite compassion of his Sonne, that spared not his owne life, but shed his blood plentifully for our saluation. Let vs with boldnesse, confidence, and assurance flye vnto our high Priest Christ Iesus, who

is entred into the Sanctū

                        〈◊〉
                     before his father & making request for vs. The children of God therefore ought with much alacritie to cherish themselues in all their worldly troubles and affliction, seeing they haue such a high Priest as hath ouercome the gates of hell, the strength of the graue, and the power of sinne, that they shall neuer preuaile against his elect. Let not Satan terrifie thee, for our Sampson hath slaine the deuouring Lyon; hee that is the strongest of all hath bound that strong man, and spoyled him of his weapons. Let not death cause thee to startle, for Christ triumpheth ouer the graue, Oh death where is thy sting, oh graue where is thy victory? 
                     1. Cor. 15. 55. 1.

                        . 2. 1. Let not the multitude of thy sinnes affright thee, for if any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the Father Iesus Christ the righteous. But let vs bee assured, that the head being entered into the most holy place, will at length draw all the members after it, to make them pertakers with it of glory and immortality. Thus much for the first part who was the Priest.
                  
                  Now followes the second, what was the sacrifice? In the declaration whereof for our better vnderstanding I shall propound to my selfe this Methode.
                  First, to speake somewhat of a sacrifice in generall, and of the kinds of sacrifices.
                  2. To shew what this particular sacrifice was.
                  3. To shew the necessity of this sacrifice.
                  First to speake of sacrifices in generall.
                  Sacrifice was instituted by God for the vse of man after his fall; for it is thought that if man had not sinned, there had neuer beene any institution of sacrifice. The persons imployed in sacrificing were

men; for as the Apostle vnder the Gospell, would at 1. Cor. 14. 34. 1. Tim 2. 12. no hand permit a woman to execute the publike misteriall function, because she was not first in creation, though first in transgression; so from the beginning in the Church of God the act of sacrificing hath bin practised onely by men; for the better shadowing foorth of Christ the Messiah whom in that action they represented. The action of sacrificing was accounted so sacred and so honourable, that before the promulgation of the law the chiefest persons were imployed in it, and vnder the law onely those who were separated from the people and set a part for that end and purpose. Yea among the Infidels (who did apishly imitate, and heathenishly abuse that sacred ceremony) sacrifice was offered onely by some choice persons; yea pleraque sacra a solis regibus 
                           〈◊〉
                        consueta,

                      the most of their sacrifices were offered of 
                        〈◊〉
                     kings alone. And of that iudgement was Clemens Alexandrinus, who sayes, that the Egyptians (who exceeded all the heathen in aboundance and variety of sacrifices) did not commit their mysteries to euery one amougst them, &c. but to those onely which nere to come to the gouernment of their kingdome; and to the Priests, of such as were approoued for education, learning, and linage. 
                     Rex idem hominum Phoebique sacerdos. And so the word Cohen signifies both a Prince and a Priest; to intimate that the priestly office did not

                     imployed in the act of sacrificing. Now what a sacrifice is. By a sacrifice is sometime in What a Sacrifice 
                           〈◊〉
                        . scripture vnderstood the act of sacrificing; sometimes the thing ordained to be sacrificed; and 
                        〈◊〉
                     both

these concurre to the making of a sacrifice; it may therefore be thus defined.
                  
                     A sacrifice is a sacred and religious action instituted

                     by God whereby we offer some externall thing vnto the true God, which wee know will be acceptable vnto him. I called it a sacred religious action instituted by God, because it was a part of Gods worship prescribed vnto the Fathers before the writing of the law in Sinai, and taught by them vnto their children from age to age, and after the deliuering of the law commaunded expresly to the people of Israel. Againe, it was a sacred and religious action, because it was to bee performed holily and religiously to Gods glory, the edification of the Church, and the saluation of the person offering. Againe, I say it is the offering of some external thing: as Abel of the firstlings of his flock, &c. 
                     
                        Gen. 4. 4. For it must be some outward visible thing animate or inauimate. I speake of the sacrifices of the law, and not of the Gospell, which I shall shew to be as well internall as externall. I say moreouer that it must be offered to the true God; and therefore all sacrifices offered by the Heathens vnto their Idolls and fained gods are improperly called sacrifices, in regard that it can neuer be called sacred which tends to the dishonour of the true God. Furthermore I say there must bee ioyned with this, Knowledge; for there can be no acceptable sacrifice vnto God, which is done ignorantly, without the knowledge of Gods holy will, the Apostle sayes whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne. And without faith it is impossible to please God; 
                     Rom. 14. 23. now faith cannot subsist without the knowledge of that which we doe beleeue. Lastly I say it must bee a

thing acceptable to God. Therefore the price of a whore, the price of blood, a dogs head, swines blood, and the like, though they were offered yet are they abhominable, because they are forbidden, yea whatsoeuer is unseemely or vndecent is not acceptable.
                  The Leuiticall sacrifices were of two sorts Ilastika 
                     The leuiticall sacrifices of two sorts. expiatory, or Eucharistika Gratulatory. In the expiatory, propitiatory, or satisfactory sacrifice (for these different titles belong all to one thing) the Iewes had respect vnto their sinnes, and by the laying their hand on the beast, and slaying it before the Lord, they did in act confesse that they themselues had deserued death eternall for their sinnes, but by the blood of Iesus Christ the immaculate lambe who was to dye for mankind, they were assured to receiue remission of their sinnes, and freedome from eternall death. This sacrifice was called Catat, that is sinne, or a sacrifice for sinne. So Paul alluding hereunto saith, that God 
                     Zanch. de sacrificiis Iùdeorum. 1. Cor. 5. 
                              〈◊〉
                           .
                      
                     hath made him sinne for vs who knew no sinne, that is to say, God made him a sacrifice for sinne. It is also called Ilastikon, or expiatory from the end for the which it was instituted, namely to represent the sacrifice which should expiate and satisfie for our sinnes, which was Christ himselfe. So that this sacrifice was called Expiatory, not properly but Metonymically, as hauing relation to the Messiah. Vnto his sacrifice were referred that offering which was called 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      of Olon and chauo, because it was allburnt in the fire, and the priests had no part of it; or else it was so called Or Gnolab.
                      of Holah, which signifies to ascend, because it being wholy consumed in the fire, did ascend vp vnto God in the smoake. Vnto this

Expiatory sacrifice were also referred those oblations which were offered for the cleansing of lepers, for the purification of women after childbirth, for touching of dead bodies, for the sanctifying of Priests for all these pollutions had respect to the pollution of sinnes.
                  The other sacrifices were Eucharistica; or offerings of thanksgiuing, whereby they did testifie their thankfulnesse for benefits temporall or spirituall; this kind of sacrifice was called Zebach Schelamim, 
                           〈◊〉
                        pacificorum; a peace offering, because it was offered by them that had (beeing reconciled to God by the former sacrifice) receiued remission of their sinnes, and were at peace with God: as also because thereby they testified their gratitude to God for all his fauours, which the Hebrewes did comprize vnder the word Peace.
                  And to this sacrifice were referred the meate offerings and drinke offerings, the first fruits and the tenths all which were testimonies of their thankfulnes.
                  And indeed all sacrifices may be reduced to these two heads. Either Ilastika, or Eucharistika, Expiatory, or Gratulatorie. For according vnto Gods affection towards man, such were mens 
                        〈◊〉
                     towards God. Now God is either angry with vs and so punisheth vs; or is well pleased and so blesseth vs; and all the effects of God vpon euery man are either blessings or cursings; when hee is angry, hee sends cursings; when hee is well pleased, hee sends blessings; wherefore hauing stirred him vp to wrath by sinnes, the Iewes offered Ilasticke sacrifices to appease his wrath; hauing appeased his anger and pleasing him

by obeying his commandements, they obtained his blessings and fauours to their bodies and soules, wherfore they offered Eucharisticke sacrifices to testifie their thankfulnesse to the Lord.
                  Now in both these kinds of sacrifices had the Iews respect vnto the Messiah, fixing the eye of their faith vpon Christ that was to come, both in him expecting saluation by the satisfactory sacrifice of his death, and in him rendering thankes vnto Iehouah for all his blessings, which they were made partakers of through the Messiah.
                  Thus much of a sacrifice in generall, and of the kind of sacrifices among the lewes.
                  The second thing I propounded is to shew you what this particular sacrifice is which Christ offered for finne.
                  
                  As there was vnder the law a double sacrifice Ilasticum 
                     Christ offered a double sacrifice. and Eucharisticum, Expiatory and Gratulatory: So is there vnder the Gospell this double sacrifice offered by Christ: for when he had finished his Propheticall office here on earth, he then entered vpon his Pontificall or Priestly office, which was to offer sacrifice for all beleeuers. And albeit this expiatory sacrifice was first in order of nature, as making way for the Eucharisticall, whereby it might be acceptable to God, hauing satisfied for sinne by his death, and so reconciling God and man: yet in time his Eucharisticall sacrifice was offered before his Expiatory; and the reason hereof is alleadged by a most famous Diuine, whose words are these, Although the

                     Father was first to be appeased by the Ilasticall sacrifice of Christ

sinne, and of punishment beeing obtained, then should haue followed the sacrifice of thanksgiuing for all benefits obtained by Christs death and passion; yet Christ offers his sacrifice of thankesgiuing, as if hee were already crucified. For so he was indeed in Gods decree and in his determination; and in this respect hee is

                        , The lambe slaine from the beginning of the world.
                  This Eucharisticall sacrifice of Christ was in the Lords Supper, which was not vnworthily euer after Why the Lords Supper was called by the Fathers the Eucharist. in the Church of God by the Fathers tearmed by the name of the Eucharist. Yet vnderstand mee; I doe not say that the bread and the cup were this Eucharisticall sacrifice that Christ offered, but the thanksgiuing which he offered to his father. For before hee brake the bread and gaue the cup to his Disciples; it is the opinion of all ancient and moderne writers, that lifting vp his eyes vnto heauen, in the name of all the elect that were, are and euer shall bee in the world, he gaue thanks to his heauenly Father for all his blessings of nature, grace and glory, but especially for that remission of 
                        〈◊〉
                     and redemption from eternall death purchased by that sacrifice of his body vpon the crosse. So that in these two sacrifices of Christ all the Leuiticall sacrifices had their full perfection and accomplishment. Therefore the Apostle sayes (
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 5.2.) that Christ gaue himselfe 
                           〈◊◊〉
                        , an oblation and a sacrifice: by an oblation vnderstanding a gratulatory offering, and by sacrifice an expiatory host for sinne. And that the 
                        〈◊〉
                     sacrifices had their consummation in Christ appeares in that figuratiue casting the open

and doues out of the Temple, as Theophylact. on the 21. chapter of Math. obserueth, saying, Iesus eiiciendo boues & columbas, praesignauit non vltra opus esse animalium sacrificio, sed oratione, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     casting the oxen and doues out of the Temple, signified that there should no longer need the sacrifice of beast, but of prayer.
                  But it is demanded, Which of these two sacrifices it is that the Apostle speakes of? The text it selfe cleares this doubt, you heard before that the Eucharisticall sacrifices were for mercies and blessings receiued, and the Ilasticke or Expiatorie sacrifices were for sinnes committed; so that when the Apostle sayes, this sacrifice was for sinne, it plainely appeares that hereby is meant the Expiatory sacrifice of Christ offered to appease his Fathers wrath.
                  This sacrifice is no other then Christ himselfe, dying vpon the crosse for the transgressions of mankind. Origen speaking of Christ, sayes, Ipse est hostia Sancta Sanctorum. He is the most holy sacrifice for his holy ones. Which the Apostle Saint Peter confirmes. 1. Pet 1. 18 19. Ephes. 5. 2. saying, For so much as ye know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as siluer and gold: But by the precious blood of Christ, as of a lambe without blemish or without spot. Christ himselfe was this sacrifice, who so loued vs, that he gaue himselfe for vs an offering and sacrifice of a sweet smelling sauour.
                  
                  But according to which nature was Christ the safice 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . for sinnes?
                  Onely according to his humane nature, as appeares, 
                        Answ

                         for 
                           〈◊〉
                        ; by which words (the

body of Christ) we are to vnderstand the whole humane nature of Christ, for there the part is put for the whole; so that Christ the man consisting of body and soule was the sacrifice for our sinnes, and as we in soule and body had transgressed against God, so Christ both in soule and body was to suffer punishment, and to make satisfaction for our offences. Compare The whole manhood of Christ thy sacrifice. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 53. 10. this place of the Hebrews with the words of the Prophet Esa. and you shall easily discouer this truth, Yet it pleased God to bruise him, hee hath put him to griefe: when thou shalt make his soule an offering for sinne, he shall see his seede, he shall prolong his dayes, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. What the Propheticall Apostle Paul attributes to the body, the Euangelicall Prophet Esa. attributes to the soule; so that both these being essentiall parts of man, make the whole humanitie of Christ to bee the sacrifice for our sinnes. And as the Tree of life did represent the Godhead of the Messiah: so did the Animate sacrifices Why the manhood of Christ must be 
                           〈◊〉
                        sacrifice. Reas. 1. of the Leuiticall law shadow out his Manhood.
                  
                  And the reasons why this sacrifice that Christ offered should be his manhood are these.
                  1. Because that in the same nature the offence was made, in the same nature was the sacrifice to bee offered, and the satisfaction to bee performed, for otherwise Gods iustice could not be appeased: but in the nature of man was a transgression committed, therefore in mans nature must a sacrifice bee offered and satisfaction made. And for this reason the Angels that fell from God had no benefit by the Incarnation of Christ, nor by his death and passion, because he tooke not vpon him their nature, neither in

their nature did he offer sacrifice.
                  2. Secondly, the death of the beasts in the Ceremoniall law did figure out the death of that sacrifice which the Sonne of God was to offer vnto his Father for mans Redemption. So that in that nature wherein Christ dyed, in that nature he was to sacrifice: but Christ as he was God could not dye; for the Godhead is apathes, and cannot suffer; but according to his humanitie he dyed truely, and not fantastically, and in shew onely, as Marcion and the Manichees heretically thought. And indeed considering Gods eternall decree of sending his Sonne to be 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        flesh, it was necessarily required that hee should dye and shed his blood to appease his Fathers wrath, and to procure forgiuenesse of sinnes for all beleeuers: for Heb. 9. 22. according to the words of the Apostle, choris haimatekchusias ou ginetai aphesis, without blood shedding is no remission. So it appeares, that the humane nature of Christ consisting of soule and body was the Alsufficient sacrifice for the sinnes of all beleeuers.
                  3. The third thing propounded is the necessitie The necessitie of the 
                           〈◊〉
                        of Christ. of this sacrifice. Adam being seduced by his wife, and eating the forbidden fruit brought vpon himselfe and all his posteritie three euills.
                  First, hee was by his transgression guilty of 
                        〈◊〉
                     before God.
                  Secondly, he was depriued of all his grace of integrity and righteousnesse which God had conferred vpon him in his creation.
                  Thirdly, he was driuen out of Paradise, to signifie his banishment from the celestiall Paradise. Wherefore it was necessary that there should bee a sacrifice

offered for man.
                  First, that his sinnes might be remitted whereby he was turned from God.
                  Secondly, that he might be restored againe to the state of grace.
                  Thirdly, that he might be re-united and reconciled vnto God, and inherit eternall life.
                  These three were effected by the sacrifice of Christ.
                  For first by this Sacrifice our sinnes are pardoned, and the guilt of all our iniquities is washed away by the blood of Iesus: hee was that promised fountaine which should be set open for Iudah and Ierusalem to 
                     Zachar. 13. 1. Rom. 4. 25. 
                     wash in. This appeares by the words of Paul, Traditus est in mortem propter offensas nostras, He was deliuered to death for our offences.
                  
                  Secondly, by this sacrifice wee are made pertakers of his grace, whereby wee are comely in the eyes of God the Father, for hee thereby imputed his righteousnesse vnto vs, and communicated that life of grace which was radically in himselfe the head, vnto all his faithfull members: for by him it is that wee all receiue grace for grace.
                  
                  Thirdly, hereby are wee entitled againe vnto the kingdome of heauen lost by our first parents: for 2. Cor. 5. 1. 
                     when this earthly tabernacle is dissolued, we are put inro possession of that building of God not made with hands which endures for euer in heauen. All these three are contained in one verse. Christ Iesus is made vnto 
                     1. Cor. 1. 30. 
                     vnto vs of God, righteousnesse, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousnesse in the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, 
                           〈◊〉
                        in the communication of his grace; and Redemption in the saluation of our soules and bodies.
                     
By this that hath beene spoken wee may note that the beginning, middle, and end of mans happinesse is from the sacrifice of Christ; by him wee are deliuered from the bondage of sinne; by him wee are in the liberty of grace, by him are wee estated in glory.
                  By him we haue our fetters knockt off, and our filthy rags cast away; by him we are arrayed with rich apparrell of holines and innocencie; by him wee are brought into his fathers presence and are accepted of God Almightie. Through him we haue our Iustification; through him we haue our Sanctification; through him we haue our Glorification.
                  
                  Seeing then the saluation of all beleeuers is perfectly wrought and consummated by the sacrifice of Christ, here may arise a question.
                  
                     Quest. Whether there be any sacrifices to bee offered by Christians vnder the Gospell or no?
                  
                     Answ. I answer, there are not any Ilasticke or propitiatory sacrifices to bee offered for attonement with God; for to that end Christ hath offered himselfe once for all. But as you haue heard that all Christians are spirituall Priests, so they haue spirituall sacrifices to offer still vnto God; which sacrifices are these.
                  First, a broken and a contrite heart, The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart 
                     Spirituall sacrifices. Psal. 51. 17. 
                     oh Lord thou wilt not despise, without this sacrifice all others are abhominable in the sight of God.
                  Secondly the offering vp of beleeuers per leitourgian ministrornm, by the seruice of Gods ministers; of this Paul speakes, That I should be the minister of Iesus
                     
Christ to the Gentiles ministring the Gospell 
                        〈◊〉
                     God, that Rom. 15. 6. the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, 
                        〈◊〉
                     sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
                  
                     Thirdly, al manner of prayer and supplication. Let Psal 141. 2. my prayers be directed before thee as 
                        〈◊〉
                     incense, and the lifting vp of my hands as the euening sacrifice.
                  Fourthly, all praise and thanksgining which wee Heb. 13 15. giue vnto God. By him therefore let vs offer the sacrifice of prayse to God 
                           〈◊〉
                        , that is, the fruits of our

                     sacrifices.
                  Fiftly, our almes and reliefe of the poore, are spirituall Heb. 13. 16. sacrifices, To doe good and to distribute forget not for with such sacrifices God is well 
                           〈◊〉
                        . And Paul calls the beneuolence of the Philippians sent by Ep phroditus, an odor of a sweet smell, and a sacrifice

                     acceptable well pleasing to God.
                  
                  Sixtly there is the sacrifice of righteousnesse or iustice, Offer to God the sacrifices of right 
                           〈◊〉
                        : 
                     Psal 4. 5. Psal. 51. 19. and againe, Then shalt thoube pleased with the sacrifices of righteousnesse.
                  
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     there is the slaying of our sinnes, and offering them vp dead vnto the Lord with there signation

of our selues to Gods seruice, I beseech you therefore 
                           〈◊〉
                        by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a liuing sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable seruice.
                  
                  Eighthly, the bodily death of the Martyrs inflicted on them by bloody tyrants is a spirituall sacrifice. Thus Paul calls himselfe a Sacrifice. Yea if I bee offered vp a sacrifice for the seruice of your faith. And I take it in this sense, it is the Prophet Dauid speakes Phil. 2. 17. Psal. 116. 15. 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           . lib. 4. c. 15 saying. Precious in the sight of God is the death of his Saints. Thus did that holy Polycarpe the Disciple of Saint Iohn, call his death which hee indured for the Ang. tom. 5. lib. 22. cap. 10. de ciuitate Dei. testimony of Iesus a Sacrifice. And so Saint Augustine speaking of the Martyrs hath these words. The Gentils dedicated Temples, consecrated Priests, erected altars, and offered sacrifices to their gods. We Christians dedicate Temples to our Martyrs, not as to Gods, but to their memories as to dead men; whose spirits liue with the Lord. Neither doe we erect alvars whereon we sacrifice to the Martyrs, but to one God theirs and ours. Wee offer sacrifice, at which sacrifices those Martyrs as men of God are named in their place and order; nor are they 
                           〈◊〉
                        by him that offers the sacrifice, for the sacrifice is not made to them but to God, although it be in the remembrance of them, for he is the minister of God and not theirs; and the sacrifice is the body of Christ, which is not offered vnto them, for they themselues are that body. In the latter end of which words Saint Augustine shewes that the whole Church which is the mysticall body of Christ (whereof the Martyrs are a part) is a gratefull sacrifice acceptable vnto God.
                  
                     
Lastly, the sacrament of the Lords supper is a sacrifice (but not after the manner of the Papists) but onely figuratiuely. So the bread and cup are called Dial. cum 
                           〈◊〉
                        Iudeo, p. 201. & 269. edit. Comel. the sacrifices of Christians by Iustine Martyr; because they represent the sacrifice of Christ, and were instituted in remembrance of it. So Dyonisius calls it Sumbolike ierourgia☐ Symbolicum Sacrificium. Eccles. Hiera. cap. 30. a Symbolicall sacrifice. So Saint Augustine, Quod ab omnibus appellatur sacrificium, signum est veri 
                     Aug. lib. 10.

                        . 5. de ciuitat. 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . That which by all men is called a sacrifice, is but a signe of the true sacrifice. And that immolation which is in the hands of the Priest, is called the passion, death, and crucifixion of Christ: not that it is so indeed and in truth, but onely by the way of remembrance. So that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper may be called Sacrificium 
                           〈◊〉
                        , a Recordatory Sacrifice, wherein vsing the signes and Symbolls of his body and blood, with true faith, and thankfull hearts we celebrate the memoriall of the death and sacrifice of our Sauiour Iesus Christ. Wherefore the Fathers called it an vnbloody sacrifice, because it was not a proper sacrifice, but onely mysticall and figuratiue.
                  And indeed this makes it not to bee properly a sacrifice; because in a sacrifice we giue vnto God, but in a Sacrament wee receiue from God; but in the Lords Supper wee giue not the body and blood of Christ vnto God, but receiue it from the minister as from Christ for the confirmation of our faith, which makes it to be properly and truely a sacrament: but a sacrifice it is called improperly and by representation. Thus you see what was the sacrifice offered by

Christ, and what are the spirituall sacrifices of euery Christian.
                  Now followes the third branch of this first part The end of Christs sacrifice. of the text. Namely, the cause why Christ offered this sacrifice, or the end whereunto this sacrifice was directed, which is said here to be for sinne.
                  But this man hauing offered one sacrifice for sinne.
                  Here we are to note that albeit the Angels had sinned Note. as well as man, yet it was not for their sinne that Christ offered sacrifice (for they had no benefite by his incarnation, death, or passion) but for the sinnes of mankind; and withall we are to obserue that albeit Christ was a man endued with true humane nature, yet in regard he was not a sinnefull man but a lambe without blemish and without spot, a lambe for his innocencie 1. Pet. 1. 19. of nature, and without blemish for integritie of conuersation, therefore hee needed no sacrifice to be offered for him to purge his sinne, as all men els doe, but onely offered in behalfe of all beleeuers.
                  Therefore we may safely affirme that Christ receiued no benefit by his owne sacrifice in respect of remission Christ teceiued no benefit by his owne sacrifice. of his sinnes; for seeing hee was without sin, he needed no sacrifice to bee offered for himselfe. Wherefore the actiue obedience of Christ to the law did appertaine both to the elect, and to himselfe: to the elect that the law might be fulfilled by Christ for them, to himselfe, for as hee was a creature after the image of God, so was hee bound to obey the law of his creatour: but his passiue obedience appertaineth onely to the faithfull, seeing he had not sinned: therefore he deserued no punishment, and hauing not 
                        〈◊〉
                     needed no sacrifice to bee offered for

himselfe. This appeares by the word of the Angell Gabriel vnto Daniell. And after threescore and two

                           〈◊〉
                        , but not for himselfe. Thereupon worthily did the Councill of Ephesus stablish this Canon, Si quis dic it Christum pro se obtulisse 
                     Concilium Ephe sinum. 
                     sacrificium, & non magis pro nobis solum; Anathema 
                           〈◊〉
                        . If any man shall say that Christ did offer an oblation for himselfe, and not rather for vs alone, let him be accursed.
                  
                  For vs then it is that Christ offered sacrifice and for our sinne.
                  
                     Quest. But what sinne?
                  
                     Answ. All sinnes of the elect, originall and actuall, of omission and commission; of weakenesse and wilfulnesse; before their conuersion, and since their conuersion; whatsoeuer is anomia, a transgression of the law, is by this sacrifice of Christ expiated; yea the sinne against the Holy Ghost albeit it be not at any time actually pardoned, yet there is so much merit and worth in this sacrifice as to deserue the pardon of it, if the party com̄itting it could come to repentance. Not that that sinne can bee or is at any time pardoned, because of the incredulitie and impenitencie of the sinner, but that the sinne in it selfe considered cannot be so great, but the mercy of God is able to pardon it; and the merits of Christ in this sacrifice are of such sufficiencie as to deserue remission and giue satisfaction for it.
                  Now whereas it is said to be a sacrifice for sinne, it offers to our obseruation three things.
                  First, the heinousnesse and abhominablenesse of Obser. 1.
                      sinne; euery sinne be it neuer so small is both so odious

in the eyes of God and iniurious to his diuine law, that nothing can expiate it but the death and sacrifice of the Sonne of God: why then shall any Christian take pleasure in sinne, which drew Christ Iesus from his 
                        〈◊〉
                     one of Maiestie, and fastned him to the crosse, which caused him to shed his precious blood, and to giue his life as a ransome for the sons of men. As the burthen of our sinnes were well nigh vnto Christ 
                        〈◊〉
                     , so let the practise of them be vnto vs detestable. Let vs neither extenuate their number nor their nature; for the smallest sin though but once done is committed against a God of an

                     maiestie, and deserues an infinite punishment, and could not be satisfied for, but by the infinite sacrifice of the Sonne of God Christ Iesus.
                  Secondly, we may obserue heere the insufficiencie of all other sacrifices both before and vnder the law, 
                        
                           〈◊〉

                      for they were not able to

                        〈◊〉
                     but one true Ilasticke and propitiatory sacrifice for sinne, which Christ Iesus offered when he gaue his body vpon the crosse for our redemption. And therefore doth the Apostle

                     this sacrifice of Christ

                     sweet sauour. And againe, Exod. 29. 18. The offerings that are made for the consecration of the Priests are called sweet sauours vnto the Lord.
                  
                  
                     Answ. I answer, these sacrifices are to be considered two wayes, either in themselues, or as they haue relation to Christ. As they were considered in themselues, Amos 5. 21. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . Isa. 1. 13. 14. 
                           〈◊〉
                        66. 3 so they had no sweet sauour in the nostrills of God; because they were but earthly things, and of a finite vertue; and therefore doth the Lord often complaine against those that reposed confidence only in the outward ceremony of sacrificing, whose oblations were an abhomination to him. But as these offerings had relation to the sacrifice of Christ, and were offered by faith in his sacrifice, so they were acceptable vnto God, and God did smell a sweet sauor in them; not for themselues but for the Antitype Christ Iesus who was figured by them; and therefore it is said that By faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice 
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        6. 6. 
                     then Cain. Not but that Cains might in value equall Abels, but because Abel offered by faith in Christ, and Cain without faith: And as the Leuiticall sacrifices of the law were onely accepted in Christ, so and no otherwise are our spirituall sacrifices of the Gospell, yee also as liuing stones are built vp a spirituall house, an holy Presthood to offer vp spirituall 
                     Heb. 11. 4. 
                     sacrifice, acceptable to God by Iesus Christ. By which it appeares that all our sacrifices and seruices are to be presented before God, onely in the perfection of this al-sufficient sacrifice of Iesus Christ.
                  Thirdly, obserue we here the perfection of this sacrifice, Obser. 3.
                      in that there was nothing in sinne, but the

contrary might bee found in this sacrifice. In sinne there is imperfection, in this sacrifice perfection; in sinne disobedience, in this sacrifice obedience; in sin carnall delight and pleasure, in this sacrifice vnspeakable torture and torment; in sinne pride, in this sacrifice humilitie; in sinne enuy, in this sacrifice loue; in sinne mans destruction, in this sacrifice mans restauration; in sinne death, in this sacrifice life. So that wheresoeuer sinne had made a breach, this sacrifice of Christ makes it vp, giuing full satisfaction for euery default.
                  
                     Quest. But here will arise a great question which of late hath troubled the Church of God, and it is this. Seeing here it is 
                        〈◊〉
                     downe indefinitely that Christ offered one sacrifice for sinne; Whether did Christ offer a propitiatory sacrifice to satisfie for the sinnes of all men; as well reprobates as elects.
                  
                     Answ. The Arminians are of opinion that Christ 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        Molin. Anatom. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . by the sacrifice of his death obtained remission of sins, reconciliation and saluation for all and particular men. Nor doe they doubt to say, that by the death of Christ, reconciliation was obtained for Cain, Pharaoh, Saul and Iudas, not as they were reprobates but as they were sinners: for God (say they) doth equally intend and desire the saluation of all men; and the incredulitie of man is the cause that remission and reconciliation is not applyed to all. They hold moreouer that the end which God propounded to himselfe in deliuering his Sonne to death was not to apply the benefit of remission to some particular men; nor doe they 
                        〈◊〉
                     that Christ was appointed to death by his Father before God thought of sauing men. One

of them sayes, That reconciliation being obtained, 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , pag. 21.
                      there was yet no necessitie of application; that is, after saluation and reconciliation for almes was obtained, there was no necessitie that any one should bee saued; because hee will haue the decree of sending Christ in order to goe before the Decree of sauing those that beleeue; therefore that God intended to send his Sonne, when as yet hee had not intended to saue them that beleeue. And the 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      would haue this to be the end why God sent his Son, namely, to make the saluation of men possible, and to lay open a way to himselfe whereby hee might saue sinners, without any preiudice to his Iustice; (by this meanes say they) God hath gotten power of sauing man, because without the death of Christ, by which the iustice of God was satisfied, God could not bee willing to saue man.
                  But the Truth bids vs be of another opinion. Wee doe acknowledge that Christ dyed for all men; but we deny that by the death of Christ saluation and forgiuenesse of 
                        〈◊〉
                     is obtained for all men: or that reconciliation is made for Cain, 
                           〈◊〉
                        , Saul, Iud 
                           〈◊〉
                        . Neither doe we thinke that remission of sinnes is obtained for any one whose sinnes are not remitted; or that saluation was purchased for him whom God from eternity hath decreed to condemne. We deny that election is after the death of Christ, seeing Christ doth euery where affirme that he dyed for his sheep, and for those whom his Father gaue him.
                  And when we say that Christ dyed for all, wee take it thus, that the death of Christ is sufficient to saue 
                        〈◊〉
                     doe 
                        〈◊〉
                     ; 
                        〈◊〉
                     and that it is sufficient

to saue all men that euer were, are, or 
                        〈◊〉
                     bee if they did beleeue in him; and that the cause why all men are not saued is not the insufficiency of the death of Christ, but the incredulity of man.
                  Whosoeuer therefore shall say that Christ offered his body an expiatory sacrifice for the sinnes of euery particular man, as of pharaoh, Cain and Iudas; hee doth by this doctrine openly mocke God: for Christ is imagined to obtaine that from his Father which he knew would neuer profit; as if God should grant to his Sonne the saluation of that man, which from eternity he decreed to condemne: for if Christ obtained reconciliation and remission of sinnes for Cain or Iudas, whether considered as reprobates or as sinners, yet he knew this reconciliation and remission should neuer be applyed vnto them; and therefore their doctrine is as if Christ should say vnto his Father, I pray thee receiue to 
                           〈◊〉
                        those whom I know thou 
                           〈◊〉
                        neuer receiue into 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and whom I know certainly to be condemned. For Christ as God knew full well the secrets of election.
                  Surely these men doe their endeauour that Christian Religion should be made a mocking stocke. Can God at one and the same time loue and hate a man? Loue him because he giueth his Sonne for him, and would haue reconciliation obtained for him: hate him because from eternitie he decreed to condemne him. Can God be so vniust as to punish one offence twice? For once Christ (as the Arminians teach) sustained the punishment of 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      and Iudas, and for them made satisfaction vpon the crosse, yet for the same sins doe the same persons suffer eternall death.

                           〈◊〉
                        . 
                     Christ

                        fus offere a not his body vpon the crosse to bee a propitiatory or

                         for the sinnes of any
                     
                     reprobate, but onely for the sinnes of the elect, which haue in times past, doe at this present, and shall hereafter, beleeue in Christ and attaine to true repentance. This Rom. 3 25. benefite then of Christs sacrifice is onely confined to beleeuers, as the Apostle manifests, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood; whereby it appeares that there is no propitiation without faith, and consequently no obtaining of reconciliation.
                  And the same Apostle in the same epistle affordeth Rom. 8. 33. 34. a strong testimony for the confirmation of this point, for he sayes, who shall lay any thing to the charge, &c. which place tells vs, that they for whom Christ dyed cannot be condemned, nor can any thing be layed to their charge: but the reprobates are condemned, and something is laide to their charge; therefore Christ dyed not for them: neither did he make satisfaction for their sinnes; but onely for such as beleeue in him; and for these alone doth hee also make intercession, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou 
                     Ioh. 17. 9. 
                     hast giuen me. So that the Ocean of Christs loue in offering of sacrifice and applying it, is bounded within the shoare of beleeuers, not extending it selfe vnto any reprobate; wherefore the Scripture, which is the best expositer of it selfe, shewes that when it sayes, 1. Ioh 2. 2. 
                     Christ was a propitiation for the sinnes of the whole world; meanes not of all men in generall, but makes it plaine by restraining it to some onely, This is my blood which is shed for many for remission of sins, and Math. 26. 28.

                     of many. By this it is plaine that all men haue not

benefite by Christs sacrifice, neither is the guilt of euery mans sinnes washed away by the 
                        〈◊〉
                     of this lambe of God, but onely of the elect in Christ who haue, doe, and shall beleeue in his holy name. Away then with the erroneous innouation of the Arminians, teaching satisfaction for each particular man. And away with that 
                        〈◊〉
                     conceit of most common people, concerning 
                        〈◊〉
                     Redemption, whereby they are apt to say, that all men shall be saued, and God forbid that any man should goe to hell; thus out of

                     and Sacrifice of Christ with the end of both of them beeing thus largely and sufficiently explained, I shall thinke it necessary now to draw all that hath beene formerly spoken to this Corrolary which I will lay downe as a generall doctrine collected out of the three parts of the first branch of the text, and it is this: That Iesus Christ the eternall 
                     The Corrolary or generall doctrine. 
                     Sonne of the euer-liuing God, as God and man was the onely Priest that offered on the crosse his whole humane nature, soule and body, a true and perfect Expiatory sacrifice to satisfie for all the finnes of all true 
                           〈◊〉
                        ; where by hee wrought their perfect reconciliation with God, and obtained full remission for all their offences. The which position in euery particular hath beene so fully prooued that it needs no further confirmation; wherefore it shall be necessary to make some application to our selues. The vses to be made of this doctrine are diuers.
                  
                     Vse 1. First, it teacheth vs to consider the true

and proper nature of sinne, which is so contrary to the 
                        〈◊〉
                     essence of God, so opposire vnto his sacred law, so odious and abhominable in his eyes, so noxious and dangerous to the soule of man, that all the creatures in the world, men and angels, gold and precious iewells, could not appease the wrath of God, or be a propitiatory sacrifice for the atonement and reconciliation of mankind, but onely 
                        〈◊〉
                     Christ, God and man, the eternall Sonne of his Father. Oh then how are most men too blame that esteeme their 
                        〈◊〉
                     as things not worthy regarding, not worthy excepting against; and how are all men to bee condemned, that either for a little gaine, or a small deale of perishing pleasure, will make no scruple to pollute, 
                        〈◊〉
                     to wound and slay their soules with wilfull and knowne wickednesse? Alas, alas, sinne is so hainous in Gods account that all the world is not able to satisfie for it; but onely the eternall Sonne of God, and that by being a sacrifice, and powring foorth his precious blood. Well then did sinne draw Christ from the bosome of his father? Did sinne cause him to take our nature vpon him? Did sinne nayle him to the crosse, piercing his hands, his feet, his side? Did 
                        〈◊〉
                     take away his blood, and with his blood, his life? Did sinne make him a sacrifice, burning in the flames of his fathers wrath, and crying, Eli, Eli, 
                           〈◊〉
                        , My God, my God, why 
                           〈◊〉
                        thou for saken me? was sinne the procuring cause of all this his 
                        〈◊〉
                     ? Cursed then be that man that shall eyther 
                        〈◊〉
                     and delight in sinne, or shall extenuate and lessen his sinne, esteeming it 
                        〈◊〉
                     or slender cause why God should cast a man into hell; or (as sinne 
                        〈◊〉
                     the

heart of Christ shall not bee pricked and pierced at the heart with sorrow and repentance. Put thy sinne in one ballance and the price that was payd for it in the other; and thou shalt soone finde the one to be of infinite weight to presse thee downe to hell, and the other to be of infinite pretiousnesse to recouer thee to heauen. This is the first vse of this point for information to teach vs that if Christ were offered a sacrifice for our sinnes; sinne then is not to be 
                        〈◊〉
                     as a slight and slender thing.
                  
                     Vse 2. The second vse of this point is for instruction, to teach vs what loue God the Father hath expressed vnto vs mortalls in that he sent his Sonne to bee a sacrifice for mankind. God commendeth his loue towards vs, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ dyed 
                     Rom. 5. 8. 
                     for vs.
                  
                  Great, yea infinite surely was the loue of God, in that when we had reiected him, and giuen heede to the entisements of the Serpent, when we had raced forth his image out of our whole man, and instead thereof had imprinted therein the feature of the Diuell; when we had rebelled against our maker, trampling his law vnder our feete, destroying our owne soules, yet that there should remaine within his bosome a more then fatherly affection towards vs, insomuch that he gaue his onely sonne, that euery one 
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 3. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 
                     that 
                           〈◊〉
                        in him might not perish, but haue euerlasting life; this is loue indeede, farre transcending the loue of any creature, which ought to beget in vs true thankfulnesse and a holy retorsion of loue againe. For, but that God had so much compassion on Adam, as to make vnto him, that promise of the

blessed seede, he and we in him, had beene hopelesse and helpelesse, not 
                        〈◊〉
                     to get forth of that pit into which we were plunged: so that the Lord may say 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 13. 9. vnto Adam, Perditio tua ex te ô Adam, saluatio ex me, Oh Adam thy destruction proceedes from thy selfe, thy saluation only from me and from my loue. Should not the consideration of this loue of God plentifully powred out vpon vs, without any desert on our part, prouoke vs to loue him with all our heartes, withall our strength, withall our power. Why do men loue riches more then God? why doe men loue pleasure more then God? why do men reioyce more in temporall honour, then in God? Because they call not to minde the loue that God hath shewed to mankind, in sending his sonne into the world to be a sacrifice for our sinnes. Hath God so manifested his loue, and shall it be so buried in obliuion? Psal. 50. 22. 
                     O consider this yee that forget God, least I teare you in peeces, and there be none to deliuer you.
                  
                  Here as God the father hath manifested his compassion, so God the Sonne Iesus Christ hath declared his prompt and ready affection to vs poore sinners, in that sponte of his owne free-will, he was pleased to take vpon him that arduous and paineful office of priesthood, and to effect that stupendious worke of our redemption. That he that was verbum increatum, the Word increate, should become verbum incarnatum, the Word incarnate: Here was loue without parallell, without compare: Especially if wee consider that he could not take vpon him the shape of a seruant, but he must infinitely humble himselfe; and in humbling himselfe he must die for vs, and in

dying for vs, he must die not for the righteous but for sinners; and if the wordes of Christ be true, that greater loue there cannot be then that a man should lay 
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        14. 15. 
                     downe his life for his friend; how great then is that loue when God shall lay downe his life for his enemies? If Christ hath thus loued vs, let vs labour to loue him againe, and if wee will giue an euident demonstration of our loue to Christ, let vs expresse it by this, euen by our care to keepe his commandements; for so sayes Christ, If yee loue me, keepe my commandements. Thus so often as wee meditate on the Priest-hood and sacrifice of Christ, whereby wee receiue remission of sinnes, and reconciliation, wee should in them as in a glasse behold the incomprehensible compassion of God our father, and the vnspeakable loue of Christ our Sauiour.
                  The third vse of this point is for consolation vnto 
                        Vse 3. all Gods elect, who are sanctified with the grace of Christ, hauing the eyes of their vnderstandings illuminated, and being renewed in the spirit of their minds, are become new creatures; for to them hath he made an atonement and reconciliation, by his sacrifice and oblation which hee offered vpon the crosse, once for all.
                  
                  Whosoeuer thou art therefore, that fearest the Lord, and art begotten againe to a 
                           〈◊〉
                        hope: albeit, thou findest in thy selfe many failings and infirmities, and that the burthen of those 
                        〈◊〉
                     which thou diddest commit in the dayes of thy vnregeneration, and non-conuersion doe so oppresse thee, as that thou art weary and heauy laden; yet lift vp the eyes of thy faith vnto Christ, hee was the Priest

that offered vp his humane nature, an al-sufficient sacrifice for the sinnes of all that beleeue in him; he felt the sharpe wrath of God against him, but it was for thy sinnes, that thou mightest be freed from the wrath to come, he hath borne thine infirmities, he was broken for thy transgressions; the chastisement of thy peace was layd vpon him, and by his stripes thou art healed; he put himselfe in thy roome, and by the punishment of his soule and body, did free thy soule and body from eternall damnation.
                  If therefore thou be stung with sinne, Christ is the brazen Serpent exalted on the crosse: list vp the eyes of faith vnto him, and thou shalt be restored. It was for thy sake that Christ Iesus was made a Holocaust or sacrifice, that he might abandon all enmity, and consummate a perfect peace betweene thee and God. Wherefore feare not thy sinnes, but reioyce in thy Christ; and let thy soule be ioyfull within thee, say vnto thy soule as Dauid did, Prayse the Lord, ô my soule, and all that is within me, prayse his holy Name; because hee hath of his tender compassion, on thee conferred the riches of his mercy, and incorporated thee into the mysticall body of his sonne Christ Iesus, by whose most holy sacrifice God is so appeased that I dare runne boldly vnto the Throne of Grace, and with confidence in his name assure my selfe of eternall life.
                  But vnto all wicked men, which liue without feare, and die without repentance, (albeit their outward profession be more glorious in shew, then was the profession of the most strict Pharisie, but doing good workes in hypocrisie and dissimulation) I

will say concerning the benefit of Christs Sacrifice, as Peter sayd to Simon Magus touching the guifts of 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 8. 21. 22, 23 the Holy Ghost, You haue neither part, nor lot in this matter; (that is in the sacrifice of Christ,) for your heartes are not right in the sight of God. Repent 
                           〈◊〉
                        of your wickednesse, and pray God, if perhaps the thoughts of your hearts may be forgiuen you: for I 
                           〈◊〉
                        you are in the gall of bitternesse and band of 
                           〈◊〉
                        .
                  
                  Oh you wicked and vngodly men, 
                        〈◊〉
                     not your soules, feede not your selues with vaine hopes, and dreaming expectations of future happinesse, for vnto heauen can you not come, but by the sacrifice of Christ, and till you leaue your sinnes by 
                        〈◊〉
                     and reformation, and be changed from your miserable state of nature, to the comfortable state of grace, you can haue no part norportion in Christs sacrifice; for that was onely offered for them that were elected before all time, and shall be called in time to the sauing knowledge of the Lord Icsus Christ.
                  Wherefore if any man desire to come to heauen, and there to enioy the felicity of Gods glorious Kingdome, let him then by a true 
                        〈◊〉
                     faith apply the sacrifice of Christ vnto himselfe, Let the

                        Vse 4.
                  
                  The last vse of this point is for consutation of that most blasphemous doctrine; and damnable heresie of the Church of Rome, concerning the sacrisice

of the Masse established by Canons in the cursed Councill of Trent, and is now taught, and beleeued by all Papists. The words of which Canons are 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        . these, If any man shall say that in the Masse, there is not offered vnto God a true and proper Propitiatory Sacrifice vnder the formes of bread and wine: or shall deny that by this sacrifice is effected, that those which come vnto God with a true heart and vpright conscience, do obtaine mercy, let him be accursed.
                  
                  The other Canon hath these words, If any man shal say, the sacrifice of the masse to bee onely a sacrifice of praise and 
                           〈◊〉
                        , or a bare commemoration of the sacrifice of Christ vpon the crosse, and not propitiatory; or shall say that it is profitable onely for him that 
                           〈◊〉
                        it, and not both for the quicke and the dead; for their sinnes, punishments, and satisfactions, let him bee accursed. This diuelish and most hereticall doctrine as it hath beene already confuted by the Scriptures (which are as the ancients stile them the touchstone of truth, the pillar of faith, a strong army against heretickes) so shall it also appeare to bee vnknowne to the Fathers of the Primitiue Church, and gain-sayd by diuers of then owne Writers.

                     wee shall somewhat more then ordinarily relye vpon the

                     of Writers, it is to be borne with, in regard that it is the best course (

                     of antiquity, and the testimony of their

                     shall I 
                        〈◊◊〉
                     , because it falls so patte in the way, that I must eyther remooue

it, or leape ouer it; as also, because herein consisteth the most principall part of Diuine Seruice in the Church of Rome; and vnto them it is the badge and cognizance to distinguish betweene the good and euill Christian; and in going thereunto, or not going, a man workes his owne saluation or damnation; as also because it compriseth in it the doctrine or the practise of the most points of controuersie betweene them and vs.
                  The Methode which I shall follow in this ensuing confutation shall be this.
                  First, I shall shew that the pretended sacrifice of the Masse hath no foundation either in the Scriptures or practise of the Apostles, or was knowne to the Fathers of the first sixe hundred yeares after Christ.
                  Secondly, I shall shew how the Masse got entrance, increase, and continuance in the Church of Rome from the time of Gregorie the great, vntill these 
                        〈◊〉
                     dayes.
                  Thirdly, I shall answer vnto the Obiections of our Aduersaries.
                  Lastly, I shall lay downe arguments confuting them, and establishing the Doctrine now taught in the Church of England.
                  And for the first of these.
                  If this sacrifice of the Masse haue any ground in Scripture, the Papists will be sure to alleadge whatsoeuer may seeme to make for their purpose. Let vs then lay in the ballance of the Sanctuary their wrested Scriptures, and see how they prooue the matter in hand.
                  
                     
First, they alleadge the words of our Sauiour to 
                        Allegat. 1. Ioh. 4. 23. the woman of Samaria: The houre commeth that you shall not worship the father neither in this mountaine nor at Ierusalem, but the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth. What prooue they from hence? to adore, say they, is to sacrifice; which Answ. sacrifice, say they, is the sacrifice of the Masse. But who can be so blind as not plainely to discerne, that by worship is meant all spirituall seruice, and that after the materiall sacrifices the spirituall sacrifices shall succeede. And Saint Augustine vnderstands it of inward

                     and spirituall prayer. Wouldest thou pray in a Temple? pray within thy selfe (saith he) changing this outward and materiall Seruice to inward and spirituall. Chrysostome expounds Christ to

is palpable when he saith, That it is perspicuous by the testimonies of Christ himselfe, and of Paul the Apostle, and of the ancient Fathers, that Christ instituted the sacrifice of the Masse, and was the Authour thereof. Wherefore hauing recited the institution of the Sacrament out of the 22. chapter of Luke, and the first of the Corinth. the eleuenth, vpon these words: Doe this in remembrance of me; hee concludeth, that by those words Christ gaue commandement to sacrifice; for to doe signifies to sacrifice according to that of Virgill.

And the greeke language wherein the Euangelist Luke, and the Apostle Paul writ, vseth not the word Poiein to sacrifice. Wherefore Christ instituting there not a Sacrifice but a

                     as they were seruing the Lord. I know in the greeke Church the Lords Supper was called leitourgia, a liturgie or seruice, but that is kat exochen, because it is the clearest badge of our Christian profession, and a speciall worke of Gods seruice. So the Apostle calls the almes of the Saints leitourgia, a liturgy or seruice, in both which places the word is vsed Rom.

                  But what is the meaning of the former place. Leitourgounton, As they were ministring, Oecumenius tells vs, Truely the same that (

                     The second sayes, He speaketh nothing of what kind Caietan. in loc. their ministring was, but in as much as hee had spoken before of Prophets and teachers, he would in finuate vnto vs, that they serued God in teaching and prophecying. Among these and all ancient expositers there is not one can be found that did euer dreame of finding the
                     
Masse in this place of Scripture. But let vs further grant that the word doth signifie that they were celebrating the holy Sacrament: yet what can they from thence collect to prooue the sacrifice of the Masse? yea but, say they, Leitourgein signifies to sacrifice.
                  Nay, but properly to execute a publike charge either in spirituall or temporall affaires. Wherefore Suidas calls Leitourgia, he demosia huperesia, a publike of fice or charge; and so is called quasi ta leita ergazein; to 
                     Rom. 15. 16. 
                     doe some publike worke for the people; or suppose wee should yeeld they were sacrificing, why not sacrificing the Gospell according to that place which formerly I haue quoted and expounded to bee nothing els, but by preaching the Gospell to make the sacrifice of Christ to be knowne to their hearers; and by the sword of the spirit the word of God to kill and slay mens sinnefull lusts, that so they may bee offered vp to God a pure and vnspotted sacrifice.

                  Secondly, in that none of them were euer mentioned by any of the Fathers that liued 500 yeares after Christ. Lastly, in that in the masse of St. Iames many sentences, yea whole clauses of Paules Epistles are wouen in and inserted, albeit St. Iames was beheaded before Paul writ any Epistles.
                  Fiftly, they alledge for the maintenance of their Allegat. 5.

                     altar, whereof they haue no power to eate which serue in the Tabernacle. Now say they, if they had an altar, then had they also a sacrifice, and if a Sacrifice, what, but that of the Masse?
                  
                     Ans. I answere, let vs learne what this Altar is, and wee shall soone know what the sacrifice is. The scope and meaning of the Author is to prooue that as the beasts were burned without the campe which were offered for sinne-offerings for the people; so Christ suffered without the gates, being made a sinneoffering for his elect; and as the Priest that serued in the Tabernacle had no part of that sinne offering, so they that trusted in the ceremonies of the leuiticall Law, and thought to be made perfect by legall sacrifices; they had no part in Christ, and that because they did make frustrate the Crosse of Christ, which was the visible Altar, whereon hee was offered without the gate.
                  And thus, and no otherwise, hath their owne 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . glosse vnderstood it, saying, We haue an 
                           〈◊〉
                        that is the Crosse vppon which Christ was offered, of which
                  
                  
                     〈12 pages missing〉
                  
                  
                  
                     Christs sacrifice. And (saith he) according to this second manner, it is proper to this sacrament that Christ is immolated or sacrificed therein. Thus these great and learned Doctors, pillars I may call them of the Church of Rome confesse the same with vs, that Christ is not really, properly, and truely sacrificed in the Eucharist, but Metonymically; because therein is a representation of the death of Christ, and a commemoration of his passion; and an application to euery particular beleeuer of the benefits of Christs redemption vnto himselfe by faith.
                  And here we are to take notice of the reason, why the Fathers tearmed the Sacrament by the name of a Sacrifice; and why they called it an vnbloody Sacrifice.
                  
                  Seeing the whole outward seruice both of the Iewes and Gentiles consisted principally in sacrifices, it seemed hard and harsh to those that were conuerted either from the one side or other, and like to giue much offence, if the Church should wholy abolish all sacrifices; because these Prosolites newly conuerted to Christianity did not beleeue that religion could subsist without sacrifices. Least therefore they might exasperate or prouoke either the one or the other, the Christians applyed themselues both to heare and speake of altars and sacrifices; and for that the Apostles had taught them that all externall sacrifices had their end in Christ, they therefore durst not giue any approbation to the continuance of Iewish sacrifices, much lesse to Heathenish: therefore they called the Lords Supper, their prayers, their seruice, their almes, and well-nigh euery religious actions

a Sacrifice, the Table of the Lord, an Altar, the Bishops, and Pastors, Priests. And thus the Fathers called the Supper of the Lord, the true Sacrifice of Christ, because of the truth of representation, and truth of the effect thereof to the faithfull, because also August. 
                           〈◊◊〉
                         Deil. 10. c. 20.
                      that the Church doth therein truely offer her selfe to God, as August. de ciuit. Dei. lib. 10. cap. 20.
                  Thus the Lords Table was called by the Fathers an Altar, not properly, but by a signe and allusion; Auth. libr. de cultur. agr. Dom. in August: and hereupon sometimes it is called an Altar, sometimes a Table. The Table of thy spouse hath holy bread and an 
                           〈◊〉
                        Cup. And Augustine, None say so 
                           〈◊〉
                        such as receiue life from the Lords Table. Againe he calls August. cont. lit. Petil. lib. 2. c. 47
                      it an Altar (Ad Bonifa. Epist. 90.) saying They rushed in vpon him with horrible 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and furious cruelty with clubs, and such like weapons, as he stood at the Altar, breaking downe the wood of the Altar most barbarously. And some of the Fathers deny that they haue any Altar properly; which doubtlesse they would neuer haue done, had they acknowledged a Propitiatory sacrifice in the Sacrament. Our Altar is an earthly gathering together of such as do apply themselues to prayers.

                     Arnobius sayth, The heathen did accuse the Christians, because they did not build them Altars. About the 400. yeare Altars began, not for sacrifice, but for the honour and memory of the Martyrs; as the Councill of Carthage doth record, cap. 11. Concil. 5. Carth.
                  
                  Now how do the Fathers call it an vnbloody sacrifice? In two respects, first thereby to distinguish betweene this representatiue Sacrifice of the Sacrament, and the bloody sacrifices of the law, and the

bloody Sacrifice offered by Christ himselfe vpon the Crosse; by which very distinction it appeares that Zanch. de cultu. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . the Fathers dreamed not of Transubstantiation or the presence of any humane or 
                        〈◊〉
                     blood, in the Sacrament, for then doubtlesse they would neuer haue vsed that distinction. And me thinkes that distinction being admitted by the Church of Rome, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     and ouerturneth the reality of a Propitiatory 
                           〈◊〉
                        : For Christ cannot be sacrificed except hee be slaine, and he cannot be slaine without shedding of blood, and if his blood be shed really vpon the Table after a corporall manner, then how is it an vnbloody Sacrifice: wherefore it is first called an vnbloody Sacrifice to distinguish betweene the bloody sacrifices of the Iewes, and of Christ himselfe; it being not a resacrificing of Christ, but onely a figuratiue representation and a mysticall commemoration of the sacrifice of Christ.
                  
                     Secondly, it was called an vnbloody Sacrifice, because it was Eucharisticall and a sacrifice of prayse and thankesgiuing, as for all blessings in generall, so especially for the worke of our redemption by Christ. And this is manifested by a notable saying of Saint 
                     In tem. 3. ex lib. 
                           〈◊◊〉
                         Petr. 
                           〈◊〉
                        cap. 19. Augustine, Hold it firmely, and doubt not that the only begotten sonne of God, which was made flesh for vs, offered himselfe for vs a sacrifice of a sweet smelling sauour vnto God, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost, in the time of the ancient Law, liuing sacrifices were offered; and to whom now with the Father and the holy Ghost, one onely God, the holy Church dotb not cease to offer bread and wine throughout the whole world. For in those carnall sacrifices there is a

figuring of the flesh of Christ, which hee was to offer for our sinnes, and of the blood which he was to shed for the remission of sinnes: but in this sacrifice there is a commemoration and thankesgiuing for the flesh of Christ which he hath offered, and of the blood which he powred out for vs. Obserue here, first he calleth it bread and wine which is offered: Secondly, hee shewes the end, only for commemoration and thanksgiuing.
                  
                  So that none of the Fathers did tearme the Eucharist or Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in that sence which the Papists doe, to bee an vnbloody sacrifice; because Christ without shedding of 
                        〈◊〉
                     was really, properly, and personally offered; but because it was both a representation of that substantiall and great sacrifice which Christ offered on the Crosse; as also because it was a sacrifice of prayse, thanksgiuing, and commemoration.
                  
                     And heereupon some of the learned Papists as Gropperus and others being ashamed of this grosse 
                     Gropperus. 
                     and 
                           〈◊〉
                        opinion of the Romanists, haue confessed the Masse to be nothing but, Onely a remembrance of the passion of Christ, in a publicke congregation of Christians, where there is a generall thankesgiuing for the benefit of our redemption; but that Sacrifie of Christ vpon the Crosse, to bee offered to God, and to remaine in the presence of God in the time of the Supper, that when a man despaires of his owne worth, hee may apprehend the price of our redemption (to wit) the body of Christ by faith, and offer it to God, betweene the wrath of God and his sinnes, for the obtaining of that pardon which Christ hath both merited and procured.
                  
                     
Thus haue wee at length, brought this first part of our confutation to an end, in which is plainely prooued, that the Popish Sacrifice of the Masse, hath no foundation either in the Scriptures, or Apostolicall constitutions; or was either knowne vnto, or named by the Fathers for the space of 600. yeares after Christ; as also that the Fathers vsed the word Sacrifice in a farre different sence from that of the Church of Rome.
                  
                  The second part followes wherein wee shall demonstrate The second generall part. how, and by what degrees the Masse was brought into the Church, and how it increased; and first shall I shew the meaning of the word Masse, and how it was vsed in the Ancient Church.

                      themselues are not certaine of the antiquity of the word Missa, the Masse; yet they finde it no ancienter then Pope Leo, and Saint Ambrose his time; so their Azorius Iesuit institut. moral. part 3. lib. 10. cap. 18. As also Massonius

But the word Missa when it is vsed by the Fathers, signifies nothing but a publike meeting to the Communion, and prayers; or a dismission of the assembly, or the forme of their religious worship: For the first of these it 
                        〈◊〉

                     gathered together, to serue God publikely (as Georg.

                  Secondly, the word Masse was vsed for the forme of religious seruice vsed by, and in the Church, and

signified the same with

answere was returned, Kaloi k'agathoi; none but such as are good and honest.
                  
                  The second, was Missa Fidelium, the Masse of the Faithfull, which was the whole ceremony and celebration of the Lords Supper: Then all things being finished, they had liberty to depart.
                  Thus it appeares that the word Masse is not so ancient as our aduersaries pleade, Ierome who was the Pastor of Rome, and of no small credit with them, neuer vses the words; Ambrose once onely; Augustine but twise, and neither of these in that sence in which the Papists vse it. And whereas they obiect that place of Ierome one the 11. chapter of the Prouerbes, it is not thought to be his, because therein is mentioned Gregory, who liued about 200. yeares after Ierome; but the best learned do ascribe it to Bede, as they do the Sermon of Saint Augustine de tempore, to Ambrose or Hugo de Sancto Victore.
                  
                  But from the name, let vs proceede to the thing it selfe.
                  Albeit, that about the time of Saint Gregory, there hapned such an alteration of the Canon of the Masse; of the manner of seruice; of vestiments; of the bread; of priuate Masses; of prayers vnto Saints; and so continued till Charles the great, insomuch that the Church of Rome had cast off her ancient simplicity, and Matron-like habit, and became like a garish Curtezan, yet this sacrifice of the Masse was not as yet allowed of generally in the Church. Not in Gregories time, for Bellarmine himselfe confesseth he could finde nothing in his writings for confirmation of this their sacrifice. For the corporall reality

of this sacrifice, which our aduersaries defend vpon an imagination of a Transubstantiation of the bread into the body of Christ, seemes to be sufficiently Greg. tom. 1. Moral. l. 14. c. 31.
                      confuted by that disputation held by Gregory against Eutiches the Hereticke, who denied that Christ had a true humane body, against whom Gregory obiected 
                        〈◊〉
                     saying of our Sauiour to his Disciples, who after his resurrection made a doubt of that which

                      spared not to maintaine, namely, that it was not the same body wherein he was cruified, but onely a shadow of a body, and so his humanity was but kata Phantasian, not really, but onely in appearance; But Gregory obiects the words of Christ. Handle me, and see for a spirit hath not flesh

                     and bones, as you see me haue; behold my hands and feete, that it is I my selfe.
                  
                  By the same testimony of sence, may Christians now discerne bread to be bread after consecration, by which the Disciples discerned Christs flesh to be flesh after resurrection; they were to beleeue because they did see and feele it to be the flesh of Christ, wee haue the benefit of foure sences, seeing, handling,

                  And here we may note what was the faith of the Church of England about those times of St. Gregory, by an ancient Homily written in the Saxon tongue, and appointed to be preached throughout England in euery Church vpon Easter day.

                  About the 1000 yeare they beganne to ordaine Priests, with these words, Accipe potestatem missas celebrandi, & sacrificium offerrendi pro viuis & mortuis. Take power to celebrate Masses, and to offer Sacrifice sor the quicke and the dead. Then had priuate Masse gotten some life, wherein the Priest alone did communicate for himsefe, and for

those who had payed him a good price to be remembred when hee receiued the Sacrament, that intentionally the vertue of his communicating might profit them to saluation. Then began the circumgestation; or carrying about of the host with the adoration or worshipping of it. Then began they to ascribe to it the power of healing, and working of miracles.
                  And about this time did the Church of Rome giue vnto the Sacrament that great and as yet vnrecouered name of taking away the cup of the Lords Supper from the Layity, that is, like Arithmeticians they had liberally studied addition, making many things essentiall to the Sacrament of the Supper, which were not; so now they might put in practise Substraction by with-holding the one halfe of the Elements (wherwith Christ institutes and the Apostles and Primitiue Church celebrated the Lords Supper) from the lay people.

                     at all; meaning no true Propitiatory sacrifice. For (as he vrgeth) if he offered himselfe to his Father in his last Supper, then should he not haue perfected his sacrifice with one oblation made, as Saint Paul teacheth, but with a double oblation twice made, once in the Supper, and once vpon the crosse, which were most repuguant to the holy Scripture.
                  But from the time of the Laterane Councill, this doctrine of the Masse tooke such roote, and spread it selfe so farre and so fast that the greatest part of Europe is darkned with the darke shade thereof; growing by degrees from an action of thanksgiuing to an Eucharisticall Sacrifice, and from thence to a Propitiatory sacrifice by way of Mystery and Commendation; and from thence to a true, proper, and reall Propitiatory sacrifice, equall with, nay farre more effectuall then the sacrifice that Christ himselfe offered vpon the crosse. And this dangerous and blasphemous doctrine crept in the more easily by the ignorance of these latter ages both in the Church and Commonwealth, caused by the troubles of the Church of Rome; as also by the corruption of languages, which was in this last thousand yeares, occasioned by the mixture of diuers nations together in seuerall kingdomes, and especially Italy; and this heresie beeing crept into the Church was fostered and nourished by the coldnesse of mens deuotion, the couetousnesse of the Priests, and the 
                        〈◊〉
                     of the Bishops. The

coldnesse of mens deuotion was such, that whereas in the feruent zeale of the Christian Church, the Supper of the Lord was celebrated euery Lords day, yea in some Churches euery day, and great multitudes resorted and thronged thereunto, yet in processe of time, men began so to neglect the Lords Table, that there was this law enacted to compel them to a more carefull respect of communicating, That such lay people as did not communicate at the least euery feast of the Natiuity, Easter and Whitsontide should bee held for Infidells.
                  
                  This law was afterward ratified by Charles the Carol. Mag. lib. 1. cap. 138. 182. 167.
                      Great; and vrged vpon the people.
                  But hereby it came to passe that the profits of the Priests were much curtalled, because the people brought not so many offerings as in former times; wherefore the Clergie thought to vse a speedy remedie for this disease; and therefore began to teach them, that the Sacrament was not onely profitable for the saluation of the Communicants, but also for all their friends, and kindred liuing and dead, which the Priest should remember secretly with himself at the time of celebration; and this they called Vim 
                           〈◊〉
                        , the force & efficacie of the Masse. This broght in store of gaine to the Priests purse, as Diana did to Demetrius and his companions; and as the Pythonisse did vnto her Act. 10. 25. Act. 16. 16. masters; no maruaile then if they stand to maintaine that which maintaines them.
                  This doctrine of the Massing sacrifice they cunningly built vpon two foundations, which were layd both at this time, the better to keepe the people in awe, and to cause the more respect vnto their sacrfice.
                  
                     
The first was Transubstantion; for after it was taught that the bread and wine was changed substantially into the body and blood of Christ, then what reuerence was too great for this sacrifice? who could doubt that it was Propitiatory?
                  The second was Purgatory; for then (might the people argue) if our friends departed out of this world doe abide the scorching flames of Purgatory; and that wee our selues must thither too; and if the holy sacrifice of the Masse hath such vertue as to ease the soules therein; then let vs out of charitie to our friends pay some portion of money to the Priest, for the cessation of their paines; and out of loue to our selues when we dye, let vs leaue grounds and goods to the Church that Masse may be sayd for vs when we are dead. Thus you see how the sacrifice of the Masse got footing: vpon what ground it stood, and so continues.
                  But God that still prouideth for his Church, will, and hath caused light to breake out of darknes, that albeit the darknes of Fgypt bee palpable, yet light shall shine clearely in Goshen; and to this end hath sent diuers of his seruants to deliuer truth out of prison, and to manifest the light there of vnto his people.
                  Their owne tongues are against them; and some of their owne brood hatched about the time of the Laterane Councell, disclaime this point. As you haue heard Aquinas speaking in this case, pag. 71. so heare whether he be not still the same, who sayes, It

                     behooneth that there euermore should remaine some representation of the passion of our Lord. In the old teament
                     
this principall sacrament was the Paschall lambe; whereupon the Apostle sayes, Christ our Paschall Lambe was offered. And in place thereof hath succeeded the Eucharist in the new Testament, which is a Memoriall of his passion past and suffered, as the other was a prefigurer and 
                        〈◊〉
                     of his passion to come.

                      the Masse or Eucharist for no other thing then a Sacrifice of praise. And this was at that time one of the questions disputed by the Albigenses and Petrus Brutis, who was burnt at Tholosa where hee taught

                      publikely that it was not a Propitiatory. All these sacrifices (saith he) which were vsed vnder the law, were nothing but 
                           〈◊〉
                        of this great sacrifice, which was to destroy sinne, But since the comming of Christ wee vse not any other Sacrifice, but that of bread and wine which he hath ordained, & is like vnto that which Moses in the law called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         and sacrifice of prayse; for therein we prayse God for the benefit hee hath bestowed vpon vs, sauing vs by his onely Sonne, &c.
                  
                  Alexander Hales seemes to crosse the Masse in diuers 
                     Alex. Hales. 
                     of his assertions: for he speakes thus, Iesus Christ hath offered a double sacrifice, a spirituall and corporall, the spirituall that is a sacrifice of deuotion, and loue towards mankind, which he hath offered in spirit; the corporall, the sacrifice of the death which he vnderwent vpon the crosse, which is represented in the sacrament. (Marke he confesseth no realitie of a sacrifice, any otherwise then by 
                           〈◊〉
                        ). The spirituall figured by the incense and perfume which was made vpon the inner 
                        〈◊〉
                     ; the corporall which hee offered in his flesh, two wayes, that is to say, sensibly vpon the crosse,

and insensibly vpon the altar. (Obserue he tearmes it an insensible offering, not grosse vnder the formes of bread and wine.) That sensible sort being shadowed out by the sacrifices of beasts; but the insensible by the sacrificing of things that are insensible, as fruits, bread and wine, both the one, and the other vpon the vtter altar.
                  Here he maketh one Propitiatory, for such were the sacrifices wherein beasts were offered with the shedding of their blood for sinne; figuring out the singular sacrifice vpon the crosse offered by the Messiah the Lord Iesus Christ. The other Eucharisticall onely, for such properly were those of fruites, bread, &c.

                      scripture seems not much to dissent from the former; for writing of the Sacrifice of Christ that it is not to be iterated, preoccupates an obiection thus. You will say the sacrament of the altar is euery day offered vp in the Church. But the answer hereto is, that this is no reiterating of the sacrifice, but an ordinary remembring and calling to mind of the onely Sacrifice offered vpon the crosse, wherefore it is said, Math. 26. Doe this in remembrance of me.
                  
                  That most learned Arrias Montanus, vpon Luk. 22. Arrias

                      thus writes, This is my body: that is, My body is sacramentally contained in this sacrament of bread: and straight way he addes (like another Nicodemus Christs nightly disciple) The secret and most mysticall manner whereof, God will once vouchsafe more clearely to vnfold vnto his Church.
                  
                  Thus hath the light of truth appeared from the

beginning of the Primitiue Church vntill these our dayes, albeit (till within this hundred and odde yeares) it hath from the time of Gregory shined more dimmely, and since the Laterane Councell seemed well nigh to be quite extinct,
                  But at last the Sunne of righteousnes communicated his light vnto these 
                        〈◊〉
                     , which haue illuminated our Horizon, such as Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Caluine, Beza, Iewell, and many famous Martyrs in queene Maryes dayes as Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, Bradford, Philpot, &c. which (albeit it pleaseth the Romish Factors to brand them with the title of Heretickes) haue so dispelled the darkenesse of superstition, and discouered the Mysterie of Antichrist, that all the world may point out which is the purple and scarlet Whore, Babylon the great, the mother 
                     Reu. 17. 5. 
                     of harlots and abhominations of the earth; whose shame, her children, louers and friends would saine conceale, but God hath layd it open, and will dayly more and more, before men and angells, till the time come, when she shall be cast downe, burnt with fire, and made desolate for euermore.
                  Thus haue I let you see briefly (and I doubt more briefly then so ample a matter doth require) how the sacrifice of the Masse crept into the Church, and how it hath continued.
                  How first it was celebrated in a most plaine and simple manner.
                  Secondly, it began to admit some encrease of ceremonies, especially the offerings for the dead, which was but a gratulation and thankesgiuing for them, vntill 200. yeares after 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
                  
                     
Thirdly, prayers for the dead, got entrance into the Supper about 400. yeares; then came in Purgatory and redemption of soules thence by Masses, though not generally taught nor authorized by any Councill.
                  About the 780. yeare Gregoryes Masse was publikely taken vp in the Churches of Italy, whereas before Ambrose his Masse was of more generall vse.
                  Fourthly, the disputations of Transubstantiation began about the yeare 840., but were not fully concluded till the Councell of Lateran by Innocent the third, anno 1216. After which came in the offering of the body and blood of Christ vpon the altar. And after that, there followed the enclosing carying about and adoration of them. Thus grew the Church of Rome from euill to worse, till it came to that miserable state wherein it now is.
                  And as the Romanists are Innouatours in respect of the Sacrifice of the Masse, so are they also in respect both of the Canon & of the Ceremonies of the Masse: for whereas they boast that the forme of the Masse in respect of the Canon is so ancient, as that they deduce it from the Apostles, and to this end alleadge the Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy of Dionysius, some of their owne writers doe question the veritie and antiquity of that book, doubting whether it be spurious or no; and that the Canon hath admitted diuers additions by seuerall and sundry Popes appeares by their owne Polidore Virgill, whose words bee these.

                     All the Mysteries were deliuered by Christ to his Apostles barely and plainely, sauouring more of piety then outward shew; for Peter was went onely to consecrate by
                     
saying the Lords prayer; after this these 
                        〈◊〉
                     were enlarged by Saint Iames, by Saint Basill; Coelestine

                      added the entrance of the Masse, beginning with this 
                        〈◊〉
                     , Iudge me oh Lord. Damasus added the Anno 577.
                      confession which is made by the Priest before hee ascend vnto the Altar; some ascribe it to Pontianus; Gregory 
                     Anno 600.
                      added the 
                        〈◊〉
                     which followeth the Entrance; and that Lord haue mercy vpon vs, should bee repeated ninetimes, with the Antiphonie after the Epistle, Gospel, and communion. Telesphorus added the hymne of Anno 129.
                      glory to God on high. Gelasius added the conclusions of Anno 493.
                      the prayers [as vpon Christmas day, because thou didst giue thine onely Sonne, &c. as is set downe in the book of Common prayer and vsed at the administration of the Communion by the Church of England] Ierom added the Epistle and Gospell, and that all men should stand vp at the reading of the Gospell; 
                        〈◊〉
                     they borrowed from the Church of 
                        〈◊〉
                     ; the singing of Anno 336.
                      the Creed was added by Pope Marke the first? which Damasus afterward renewed; Gelasius added the Antiphony which they call Tractum, with the hymnes and prefaces which goe before the Canon, which are nine in number; the tenth to the honour of the Virgine Mary the mother of God Pope Vrbane added. Aaron first burnt frankincense on the Altar according as God commanded Moses; and Pope Leo the third commanded the same to be vsed in the Church, which also the Anno 800.
                      Heathens did vse. The washing of the hands was a ceremony taken from the custome of the Iewes, and from the Gentiles, whose vse was to wash their hands when they sacrificed. Xystus the first appointed that in the preface, Anno 170.
                      Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabbath, should bee

sung. Whereby it appeares that the Canon of the Masse was neither all composed by one man, nor was digested into that forme wherein now it is. Which appeares by this that Pope Alexander the first who

                      before Gelasius and Syricius in memorie of the passion of Christ caused these words to be added, who the day before he suffered, vnto these words, this is my body; whereby it is 
                        〈◊〉
                     that that was the beginning of the Canon. Leo'1. afterwards added, therefore this

                      and this holy sacrifice and immaculate host; Gregory annexed three prayers which are these, Dispose our dayes in thy peace, and deliuer vs from eternall damnation; and cause vs to be numbered among thine elect. So others added other things; after the Canon is ended, then is said the peace of God; then was appointed that the Priests should kisse one another by Innocent the first, Anno 408.
                      and that the people should kisse the pax by Leo the second. Anno 682.
                     
                  
                  Now for the ceremonies of the Masse, most of them were borrowed from the Iewes and ancient Idolatry of the Romanes instituted by Numa Pompilius their second King about 700. yeares before the incarnation of Christ.
                  As their shauing of Priests, which the ancient Idolatrous Romanes vsed after the forme of the Babylonians, or of the Herculean Priests, called for the same cause Stephanophores, as bearing a crowne vpon their heads; these were by the Heathenish Romanes Curio saeerdos qui in sua cura, id est in sua parocbia sacris

They vsed also a vayle to couer their heads, called an Amice first inuented by AEneas; which also our Masse Priests vse; and they will haue it to represent the vayle wherewith Christ was couered, when the Iewes mocked him in the house of Caiphas. Or the Diuinity of Christ hid vnder the humanity.
                  Adde vnto these the Stole, the Manuple, and the Zone: which three (saith one) do represent the three cords wherwith Christ was bound, and led before the High Priest. Or by the Zone (saith Biel) were figured the rods wherewith Christ was whipped; by the Stole laid a crosse, the crosse that Christ carryed on his shoulders; The Manuple carryed on the left arme represents the band of loue wherwith Christ was holden.
                  Another interpreteth the Zone or Girdle wherwith the Aulbe is trussed or tyed together, to signifie the band of the charity of God.
                  
                     
The Stole put vpon the Amice on the necke of the Priest in forme of the crosse to figure the obedience of Iesus Christ vnto the death of the Crosse.
                  The Manuple carryed vpon the left hand to figure the eternall felicity of Iesus Christ.
                  Another saith the Amice figureth Faith; the Stole humility of obedience; and the Manuple the watchfull and hearty deuotion of the Massing Sacrificer. Thus are they vncertaine among themselues of the figuratiue representations of their Sacrificall Vestments.

                  First, before the Procession went young children, then the Priests clad in white Vestments, singing hymnes, prayses, and songs vnto their gods; after followed the High Bishop (called by them Pontifex Maximus) which title was after giuen to all the Emperours of Rome that were not Christians (as appeares by their coynes and Sculptures) then the ancient Senators of Rome, and their wiues and children, with crownes on their heads.
                  In the Procession was carryed commonly the Pagent or shrine of Iupiter or Anubis oy some of the Priests clad in white Vestments, their heads beeing shauen, and hauing a crowne vpon their heads. This crowne was in such repute, that the Emperour Antonius Commodus himselfe being the High Bishop caused his head to be shauen, and to be crowned to beare the shrine of the god Anubis.
                  
                  Before the shrine went a Torch-bearer, carrying a taper light in his hand: when Procession did passe through the streetes, there were appointed certaine places for station; during which solemnitie, the Temples were set open, the Altars and Images perfumed with Incense; the shoppes being shut, the Halles of Iustice closed, and the prisoners vnchained. What

more exact Analogy and proportion can there bee then betweene the Procession of the Idolatrous Romanes, and that which is now in vse among the Idolatrous Romanists?
                  After the sprinkling of Holy-water, and the procession were finished, Numa instituted the sacrificer Ouid. lib. 4.

                      his family. For when Numa had instituted diuers orders of Sacrificers; as Bishops, Augures, Sauliens, Feciaux, Curions and others, he ordained also meanes for their maintenance, and commanded out of the common treasurie, meanes for their prouision; and many priuate persons following his example did the like; so that benefices became rich by foundations; some of which benefices were at the bestowing of the Prince or the Common-wealth, or of the Colledge of Bishops: Others were at the presentation of some priuate Patrons, and their Successours, by whom they were first founded. They had beside these, that which was offered at the Altar; and the first fruites when any of these benefices were voyde; they had also Annuals, Legacies, and Bequests which were giuen by the dead that the Priest might pray for them, as appeares this day by the ancient monuments of the Heathen Idolators.
                  They had also amerciaments, fines, confiscations, Cicer. in orat. pro domo sua ad Pontifices. as the house of Cicero when he was banished, was confiscate to the Colledge of the Priests, and dedicated specially to the sacrifices celebrated in the Temple of the Goddesse Libertie. By which it appeares

that the Idolatries and Superstitious ceremonies of the Church of Rome, are not new in themselues but borrowed from the old Idolators of Heathenish Rome, practised before the incarnation of our Sauiour Christ.
                  Neither can I here omit the ancient custome of the Romanes, which being paralelled with this of our aduerfaries differs nothing from that vsed in the now Romish Church. For in the time of Numa Pompilius

                      the Idolatrous Romanes, (after the mysteries of their worshippe were finished) did communicate within the Temple little Cakes consecrated to the honour of their Gods to whom they did offer their sacrifices.
                  These little round cakes or hostes were eaten by the Sacrificer and the assistantes, standing and not siting.
                  The Flower whereof they were made, was called Mola; from whence is deriued this word Immolare to Sacrifice.
                  These little cakes were diuers according vnto the diuersity of their gods and goddesses, and had on them the Images of those gods or goddesses, to whom they were dedicated. From whom our superstitious Aduersaries haue beene bold to borrow their Idolatrous practise of offering a wafer cake with the Picture of Christ vpon the Crosse, which cake is no longer or it was, but (as they teach) is really transubstantiated into the very body of Christ.
                  Nor must I here forget to set before the eyes of the Christian Reader, the behauiour of the Masse-Priest, while he is offering his sacrifice. First he makes three

crosses vpon the round host to signifie the threefold Doctrine of Christ, by the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost; in pronouncing these words, Haec dona, hoec munera, hoec sancta sacrificia illibata. Other Masse Glossers interpret the third Crosse to signifie the treason of Iudas. Then followes fiue crosses more to figure the fiue dayes of respite betweene Palme-Sunday, and Good-Friday. Or otherwise the fiue wounds of Christ.
                  Of which fiue crosses, the three first are made to signifie the deliuering of Christ vnto the high Priest, Or to figure the price which Christ was sold for, to wit, three times ten which make thirty.
                  The other two crosses are made separately the one vpon the host, the other vpon the chalice alone, to play the two persons of Christ and Iudas, then hee stretcheth out his armes to figure Christ stretched on the crosse. Which done he maketh three crosses to represent the threefold estate of such as haue benefit by that sacrifice, namely, those in Heauen, on earth, in purgatory.
                  He smiteth afterwards his breast, to play the part of the Publican repenting in the Temple: But this smiting must be with the three hinder-most fingers; for the thombe and the fore-finger are reserued to consecrate and transubstantiate the Host into the body of Christ; moreouer he smiteth his breast three times, to figure the three-fold offence of thought, word, and deede. Then he eleuateth the host to be adored. Then he lifteth vp his voyce to represent the person of the theefe, or the Centurion which confessed Christ in his passion.
                  
                     
Six other crosses are againe made, three vpon the chalice couered, to represent the three houres that Christ hanged on the crosse aliue; and the other three on the chalice vncouered (with the round host lifted vp againe) to figure the three houres that Christ hanged on the crosse dead. Then he kisseth the chalice, and maketh two crosses to figure the water and blood that issued out of the side of Christ.
                  Then the Priest must take the couering cloath off from the chalice, and couer it with the patyne, to figure the breaking of the vaile of the Temple in the middest at the death of Christ. This done, the host is put from aboue the chalice and is couched vnder the corporas to figure the burying of Christ.
                  The Priest hauing thus acted the parts of Christ, of the holy Theefe, of Iudas, then acteth the person of the Centurion in singing the Pater Noster, by the seauen petitions whereof Durandus would signifie the seauen weepings of the Virgin Mary, or the seauen graces of the Holy Ghost, or the seauen Beatitudes, or the seauen deadly sinnes. This song finished, the Priest keepeth silence to signifie the silence, or rest of Christ in the Sepulcher.
                  Who sees not here a Masse of fopperies, and willworship in this sacrifice of the Masse? shall not God say vnto our Masse-mungers, as he did vnto the Israelites.

wee now become Innouatours.
                  
                     Answere. I answere wee are not Innouatours because we abolish these Popish Idolatries, and keepe our selues to the practise of the Primitiue Church, but they are Innouatours, that haue brought these superstitions into the Church.

                        〈◊〉
                     as they pleade Antiquity; I answer, first Antiquity or continuance of an euill is no ground for a tolleration, and idolatry in religion is not to be permitted though neuer so ancient; for by the same argument may the Turkes

                     their Mahometan Alcoran, which they haue possessed about 900 yeares; vnder the which law they haue subdued nations, conquered Realmes and Empires.
                  By the same reason might the Israelites iustifie the sacrificing of their children vnto Moloch in the valley of Tophet, a most detestable Idolatry, yet pactised well nigh the space of 1200 yeares, till it was quite abolished by that good King Iosiah.
                  
                  The Brazen Serpent, a thing commanded by God himselfe, possessed by the Israelites for the space of 2 Kings 18. 4. 900. yeares, vnto which the people had burnt incense from time to time; yet neither the long continuance, nor the generall practise of such an Idolatry could preuaile with Hezechiah for tolleration. Could the people of Israel be excused for committing

Senatours of Rome, when they pressed him with the antiquity of their Pompilian religion, which they had obserued for the space of 1000. yeares.
                  Againe, the Masse is not so ancient as our aduersaries pretend, neither in respect of the Canon, nor in respect of the Ceremonies, least of all in respect of the Sacrifice. The Canon being patched together by sundry Popes, who haue added their parts and parcels at seuerall times. The Ceremonies as the diuers garments, holy-water, wax-tapers, the Offertory Prayer for the dead, Procession, & the like, crept in also by degrees, one after another as their owne Histories declare sufficiently. And the sacrifice not acknowledged by any till within these 400 and odde yeares, about the time of the Lateran Councell, vnder Innocent the third.
                  Now let the indifferent Reader iudge of the impudencie of our Aduersaries who bragge so much of antiquitie, endeauouring to deduce their Masse from the Apostles time, against their owne consciences, and the credit of all hystories. For hereby clearely is declared the induction not onely of the Ceremonies but also of the very Canon of the Masse; all which do not sauour only of Innouation, but also of Iudaisme and Gentilisme; the badges of a false and superstitious Sacrifice.
                  The third part of this confutation followes, wherein The third generall part, of 
                           〈◊〉
                        confutation. we shall giue answer vnto some of the maine and principall arguments wherewith they endeauour to establish their battered and shaken imposture, and to oppugne the inuincible truth of God and his Church. So that wilfully they ouerturne the very

                     principles of nature, the order of all things, the humanity of their Sauiour, the truth of the Sacrament, the truth of Scripture, the foundations of all 
                        〈◊〉
                     ; confusedly iumbling heauen and earth together, rather then they will admit of a tropicall speech in our Sauiours consecration.
                  And first for the maintaining of the sacrifice of the Argum. 1. Psal. 110. 4. Heb. 5. 6. Rhem. annot. Heb. 7 sect. 8. Bellar. cap. 6. Hoffmeist. asser. sacrif. Missae. Masse they alleadge. That Christ is a Priest for euer after the order of Melchizedech; but the proper act of Melchizedechs Priesthood did consist in sacrificing vnder the formes of bread and wine. Ergo. The eternity of Christs Priesthood standeth in the sacrificing of his body and blood in those formes by those Priests whom hee hath promised to continue in his Church till the worlds end. Rhemist. annot. Heb. 7. sest. 8. Bellar. cap 6. Hoffmeyst. assert. sacrific. missae.
                  
                  And that Melchizedechs Priesthood consisted in oblation of bread and wine, they would prooue by these Reasons.
                  First, from the word, He brought forth. The Hebrew Bellar. c. 6. Translators of Doway. pag. 56. annot. on Gen. 14. & pag. 57.
                      word is properly applyed to the bringing forth of a sacrifice; as Gen. 4. The like word is vsed to signifie Cain and Abels sacrifice.
                  Secondly, because Abraham had no need of bread and wine to refresh himselfe, being returned with so great spoyle from his enemies, and so hauing sufficient to refresh himselfe with, it is likely Melchizedech brought them forth to offer to God.
                  Thirdly, as Melchizedech is said to be the Priest of the High God, so it was requisite that the Scripture Bellar. cap. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . also should make mention of his sacrifice; but this sacrifice is not mentioned else-where.
                  
                     
Fourthly, from the phrase of the words, Melchizedech brought forth bread and wine, for hee was the Priest of the most high God; the scripture alleadging this as a reason of his bringing forth bread and wine, Bellar. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . because he was a Priest, and did it to sacrifice.
                  Fiftly, Christ is said to bee a Priest for euer: but this Priesthood cannot remaine, except his sacrifice remaine: therefore seeing the sacrifice of Christ on Bellar. ibidem. the crosse is done, he must haue another sacrifice daily to be offered in the Church, and that is the sacrifice of Melchisedech in bread and wine.
                  Vnto these we answer seuerally.
                  First, concerning the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Iaza or Iaksa, which they say signifies properly to bring forth a sacrifice; this is false, for it properly imployes as much as proferre, 
                     Zanch. de cultu dei externo. Exod. 3. 10. Exod 8. 18. Psal. 135. 7.
                      to bring forth; as if he should say, Exire feeit & adferri panem, hee made bread and wine to bee brought forth, and the word is vsed in this sense most commonly: as, That thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel forth of Egypt. So the bringing forth of lice. Exod. 8 18. The bringing forth of the winds, Psal. 135. 7. The bringing forth of water out of the rocke, and the like. And where it hath any relation to a sacrifice, there it is ioyned either with the word sacrifice or oblation, restraining the generall signification thereof to the speciall act of offering or sacrificing.
                  Wherefore whereas many of them reade it obtulit, he suffered: they corrupt the text, for it is protulit, he brought foorth; and vnto this haue we the consent of all the Fathers, who note that it was rather a Munificent act of his Regall office proceeding from his

bountie and liberality, then any Sacrificiall act of his Priestly function.
                  Therefore Ierome translates it Melchizedeck proferens panem & vinum; and Cyprian, protulit panem. And 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        Gen. Cyp. ad Caecil. 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                        
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           .
                      thus doth Rabbi Salomon expound this place, saying, that Melchizedech did testifie by this gift and good hansell, that he tooke it not in ill part that his posterity were slaine by Abraham.
                  
                  Thus also Tertullian and Epiphanius render it, with whom consent some of their owne Writers. Caietan 
                     Caietan. in Gen. 14. Sic Lyra 
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . saith, Nihil hic dictum est, &c. Nothing is here said of sacrifice or oblation, but of bringing forth, which Iosephus saith was done to the refection of them that had gotten 
                     Andrad. defensfidel. Trid. lib. 4.
                      
                     the victory, Andradius also doth herein forsake his friends, and acknowledgeth this to bee the true exposition; for in the defence of the Councell of Trent against Chemnitius, he hath these words. Wee need not Chemnitius to striue about the word offering; seeing that both in the best corrected Latin coppies, and also in the holy Fathers, which apply this place vnto the holy Eucharist, It is proferens brought forth, and I in iudgement agree with them which say that Melchizedech refreshed Abrahams souldiers, wearied and fainted with long fight.
                  
                  Vnto this doth the Romish translation consonantly accord, where the word is Proferens, bringing foorth, and not offerens offering; which 
                        〈◊〉
                     the Papists are bound by the Councill of Trent-sess. 4. not to reiect vpon what pretence soeuer.
                  The Chaldee Paraphrast saith, he brought, or caused to be brought; and the Greeke hexenegae, hee

                     brought foorth. Ambrose, 
                           〈◊〉
                        in refectionem; and

                     Hugo Cardinalis seems to hold himselfe satisfied with that sence, affirming that the Hebrew Doctours had so expounded it. And thus also Erasmus and Sigonius doe take it: for which they are reprooued by Posseuine 
                     Posseu in. biblio. Select. l. 4. c. 14.

                  And it is to be obserued, that when any of the Fathers translate it obtulat, he offered, they referre it to 
                        
                           〈◊〉

                        〈◊〉
                     
                     Abraham, returning from the warre, and offered vnto him bread and wine. They say not that he offered to God, but to Abraham, and it had beene idolatry in Melchizedech to haue offered to Abraham religiously: wherefore he offered onely ciuilly; that is, hee made proffer of bread and wine to refresh himselfe and his souldiers.
                  Secondly, whereas they say Abraham had no need thereof, in regard he had taken a greet spoyle from the enemies, &c.
                  I answer, it appeares not that Abraham had refreshed himselfe by the spoyle taken from the kings, because in the refusall of the profer made vnto him by the king of Sodome, he protests that hee would not take any thing, saue onely that which the young men had 
                     Gen. 14. 23. 
                     eaten; where he reiects all the goods, excepting onely what the young men had eaten; whereas doubtlesse had hee tasted any refreshing in the spoyle, he would haue mentioned it, as being a thing properly taken by him; and therefore (as a late Diuine obserues) 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . Synops. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . it was Gods prouidence to send Melchizedech
                     
that he should be refreshed rather at his hands, then by the king of Sodom a wicked Infidell.
                  But suppose Abraham had refreshed himselfe and his souldiours with the spoyle, yet what knew Melchizedech that; wherefore in curtesie, and to expresse his inward a acrity, hee declares it by his outward liberality and bounty; and thus much may bee collected out of the words of Iosephus, who sayes, That Melchizedech ministred to Abraham and his host victualls 
                     
                        Lib. 1. Antiquil. c. 11. 
                     and great aboundance of things necessary; and after the feast began to prayse him and blesse God who had subdued his enemies vnto him.
                  
                  Thirdly, whereas they say, that Melchizedech beeing the Priest of the high God, it was necessary that his sacrifice should be mentioned, but no sacrifice is mentioned but his bread and wine.
                  I answer there is mention made of his sacrifice implicitely, for in that he is said to be a Priest, it presupposes his offering of sacrifice; neither is it of necessity that his sacrifice should be mentioned, seeing he might be a Priest, albeit the matter of his sacrifice be not nominated; and doubtlesse many things concerning Melchizedechs Priesthood were concealed according to the saying of Paul. Of whom wee haue many things to say, which are hard to be vttered, because ye are dull of hearing; yet Paul shewes whereby hee Heb. 5 11. declared himselfe to bee a 
                        〈◊〉
                     , namely, in blessing Abraham, and receiuing tythes of him.
                  But suppose the matter of his sacrifice be not specified, must it therefore needs follow that hee sacrificed bread and wine?
                  Fourthly, they ground vpon the phrase (for he was)

alleadging it as a reason why hee offered bread and wine, for he was (say they) because he was the Priest of the high God.
                  
                  But herein they discouer their owne ignorance; for the Hebrew saith (and he was) or (but he was); So the Greeke hen de iereus tou theou; and the Chaldee 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . in Gen. 14.
                      Paraphrast; Et erat minister coram Deo, And he was a minister before God, whereunto Caietane assenteth, saying, And where as it followeth in the vulgar translation; for he was the Priest, as though this were the cause of the offering, which is not in the Hebrewes (vt causa sed vt separata clausula) as a cause, but as a disiunctine participle; as if hee would say, Melchizedech was a king, which appeares by this plentifull feasting of Abraham and his souldiours; and hee was not onely a King, but also the Priest of the high God; so that in this one verse is comprised both the Regall and Sacerdotiall office of Melchizedech; and vnto each of them is ascribed his proper act; for hauing named King of Salem, he sayes immediately brought foorth bread and wine, noting therein his Regall 
                           〈◊〉
                        . Then mentioning his Priesthood he sayes, and he was the Priest of the most High God; and immediately shewing wherein he declares his Priestly office sayes, and bee blessed him; in the former is expressed his Kingly, in the latter his Priestly function.
                  Fiftly they say, the Priesthood of Christ cannot be eternall except there remaine a sacrifice, and there remaines no sacrifice but of bread and wine, because the sacrifice vpon the crosse was finished at Christs death.
                  Vnto this we answer by denying the falshood of

this argument in diuers points.
                  First, we say the Priesthood of Christ may remaine eternall, though the Sacrifice remaine not eternally in sacrificing; for (as I haue shewed formerly) the eternity of Christs sacrifice is not to bee iudged by the eternity of the act of sacrificing, but by the vertue and efficacie of the Priest and Sacrifice, which are so Heb. 10. 14. meritorious as to procure eternall saluation vnto all beleeuers for whom it was offered; and in this sense the Priesthood of Christ is said to be eternall.
                  Againe, we affirme that the Sacrifice of Christ shall remaine for euer; not in offering, but as hauing 
                     Heb 7. 24. 
                     beene offered; so the humane nature of Christ which was our Sacrifice shall for euer remaine hypostatically vnited to the Deity.
                  
                  Againe, it is not necessary that Christ should haue an externall Priesthood here on earth that should offer bread and wine, and bee after the order of Melchizedech; for in the time of the law there was an externall Priesthood after the order of Melchizedech, yet euen then was Christ a Priest after the order 
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . Synops, papis. 
                     of Melchizedech; and as he had a sacrifice in fore, so now hath he in fuisse.
                  
                  But we demand here, if the proper act of Melchisedechs sacrifice consist in bread and wine, why doth not Paul mention it: for in the historicall relation of Melchizedechs meeting of Abraham. Heb. 7. 1. he mentions Pareu, in 7. cap. ad Hebr. those things wherein hee was a type of Christ, but neuer so much as names the bringing foorth of bread and wine, as nothing appertaining to his Priesthood.
                  And if the Church should continue a sacrifice after

                     Melchizedechs order, and haue no direction from Christ or his Apostles, it may soone erre in the maine point of Christian religion. Ho sius and after him Bellarmine saith, That this mystery was too great for the Hebrewes to conceiue; but by their leaue, the Apostle tells them of things as strange in a manner; of a man without Father, without Mother, without beginning or end of dayes. And if there had beene any difficulty, of whom might they haue beene more clearely and plainely instructed then of the Apostles? and why were not the Hebrewes as capable of this doctrine as any nation among the Gentiles?
                  And doubtlesse had the substance of the Eucharist consisted in the offering vp of Christ vnder the forms of bread and wine, both our Sauiour aud his Apostles would haue spoken clearely of it, for as Saint Augustine to this purpose. Let no man alleadge vnto me the

                     things that are spoken darkely or figuratiuely, faith must be builded vpon that which is cleare, and not subiect vnto diuers interpretations.
                  
                  I will conclude this answer with shewing two things.
                  First, wherein Melchizedech was a type of Christ; aud in what respect Christ is said to be a Priest after 
                        
                           〈◊〉

                           of Christ not kata pantos, but kata 
                           〈◊〉
                        . the order of Melchizedech.
                  
                  Secondly, the absurdities which will ensue vpon their doctrine.
                  1. He was a type of Christ in his name Melchizedech, which signifies king of righteousnesse; so was Isay 9. 6. Christ.
                  2. In that he was king of Salem, that is, King of peace, so is Christ the Prince of peace.
                  
                  
                     
3. In regard of his double office exercising publikely the sacred functions both of King and Priest; so did Christ.
                  
                  4. In that he is said to be apator, and ametor, without father, without mother; so Christ was without father as man, without mother as God.
                  5. In the eternity and continuance of his office, for there is no mention made of his death, that therein he might be a type of the eternity of Christs priesthood.
                  6. In the excellency of his person, beeing greater then the Patriarch Abraham; which appeares in blessing him. So is Christ aboue all men in regard of his humane nature, it being perfectly sanctified by the Godhead, and made the head of the Church. So that the bringing forth of bread and wine was no type of the Priesthood of Christ, albeit I deny not but it was a type of his Regall bountie and munificence, typifying the spirituall refection which Christ our King affords to all that warre against the enemies of their saluation.
                  Secondly, obserue here the absurdities that will follow hereupon.
                  They say the order of Melchizedechs sacrifice consists Vbique offertur sub sacerdote Christo, quod protulit Melchizedech quando benedixit Abraham. Aug. de ciuit. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . li. 17. cap. 17.
                      properly in sacrificing bread and wine; & their Priests offer after the order of Melchizedech: hereupon it will follow that either Melchizedech offered vp the body of Christ vnder the formes of bread and wine, as they doe; which no man euer affirmed; or they offer onely bread and wine as he did, and that they will neuer confesse; or else the sacrifice of Melchisedech, and of the Romanists being different, they must needes bee

of different orders; and thus they wound themselues with their owne weapons; for if they will ground their sacrifice vpon Melchizedechs offering bread and wine, they must needes then confesse that in the Masse is offered nothing but bread and wine; and indeede the Fathers typically applying Melchizedechs bringing forth bread and wine to refresh Abraham and his souldiours returning from the slaughter of the kings, vnto the Sacrament of the Eucharist, make an apt and fit comparison; for so Christ by the bread and wine in the Sacrament (being eaten with faith in the thing represented) nourisheth all beleeuers, refreshing them in the skirmish against their spirituall enemies.
                  But Bellarmine thinkes to shake vs off, and to make vs loosen our hold by telling vs, That the sacrifice of the Masse, and the sacrifice of Melchizedech agree in the outward symboles and formes, though not in the substance, and that is sufficient; for the representation is in the accidents not in the substance, and that was but the type or Symbole, and therefore the substance may be diuers.
                  What hath Bellarmine aduantaged himselfe by this excuse? hereupon it will follow, that they who consecrate bread and wine onely doe more properly imitate Melchisedechs sacrifice, then the Masse-Priests who say they consecrate flesh and blood vnder the formes of bread and wine. In the one there is the forme and substance of Melchizedechs sacrifice; in the other the accidents alone.
                  Againe, if Melchisedechs sacrifice doth represent the sacrifice of the Masse, it must represent it as a sacrifice; but the Masse is no sacrifice but in respect of

the inward substance, for the outward formes are not the sacrifice, but the body of Christ vnder those formes: ergo Melchizedechs sacrifice must represent the Masse in the substance which is the body of Christ.
                  
                  Thirdly, types and shadowes differ from the body in outward symboles onely, but agree in substance, as St. Paul shewes, Christ to bee the same spirituall 1. Cor. 10. 4. meate and drinke to the Israelites and vs, but to be sundryly represented by diuers Sacraments or representations; wherefore the sacrifice of Melchizedech and that of the Masse, (if it were a true resemblance of Christs sacrifice) should differ in externall forme, but agree in substance.
                  Againe, if Melchizedechs Priest-hood be eternall by the offering of the body of Christ by the Priests of Rome, then it would follow, that either these Priests shal say Masse and offer this sacrifice after the consummation of this world, and the day of iudgement; or else Christ shall make choyce of some others, who may offer this sacrifice in Heauen, or else this sacrifice must cease, and so not be eternall; any of which no man of a sound minde or firme iudgement will admit.
                  Lastly, if Melchizedechs Sacrifice of bread and wine, were a type of the Masse, then should it be (as the Church of Rome holds the Masse to be) a true propitiatory 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead, otherwise why should they so much labour to reduce their sacrifice to the sacrifice of Melchizedech, and so to make it more excellent then the Leuiticall sacrifices, the excellency whereof

cannot consist in the resemblance of the formes of Melchizedechs offering, but also in the vertue and efficacy. But no man euer sayd that Melchizedech offered a true Propitiatory sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead.
                  Thus much shall serue for answere vnto their first Argument.
                  The second Argument is taken from the Paschall 
                     Argum. 2.

                     Lambe; and it stands thus. The Paschall Lambe was a figure of the Eucharist; but the Paschall Lambe was first sacrificed, ergo in the Sacrament of the Eucharist there is a sacrifice.
                  We answere, what if we should grant them the whole argument, they cannot glory much in their purchase, for what would be concluded, but what is already granted, namely, that in the Eucharist, there is a sacrifice, to wit, Eucharisticall, or at most 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      by way of representation or recordation. But let vs grapple with our aduersaries a little more closely.
                  First wee doe confesse the Paschall Lambe and the Eucharist to haue some analogy and similitude; as that they both represent Christ crucified; as also they were both to bee eaten; the one with sowre hearbes, the other with sorrow and repentance; thirdly in the end, for remembrance of deliuerance, the one corporall, the other spirituall. But againe, there were many dissimilitudes, the Passeouer was eaten with blood, the Eucharist without materiall blood. The Passeouer was eaten at Euen, the Eucharist is administred in the Morning; of the Passeouer nothing was left, but of the Eucharist, is left and reserued by

the Papists; the Passeouer was eaten in their houses, the Eucharist in the Church; seeing then they agree not in all things; why may they not disagree in the matter of a sacrifice.
                  But to speake precisely, we cannot grant the Paschall Lambe to be a Type of the Eucharist, albeit this succeeded in the roome of the other; but properly and 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . aduersmissae sacrif. c. 4. Iohn 19. 372
                      directly to be a Type of Christ; according to the Euangelist, That the Scripture should be fulfilled, not a bone of him should be broken; and if the Typicall Passeouer was fulfilled in Christ, wee are not to seeke any other Antitype, wherein it should be accomplished. Furthermore it was not a Type of Christ in all things; for then as Zanchius obserues Zanch. de cult. Dei extern. Christ should haue beene fleade, and had his skinne pulled off, scorched in the fire, and his bones burnt, after the lewes had eaten his naturall flesh, as they did with the Paschall Lambe; but as the Lambe was sacrificed, and eaten in remembrance of their deliuerance out of Egypt, so Christ was sacrificed on the Crosse, and eaten in the Sacrament for a remembrance of our eternall redemption by his meritorious Sacrifice.
                  Vnto the assumption we answere: It is not probable that the Paschall Lambe was sacrificed; because sacrifices were brought vnto the Priest, and offered by none but a Priest on the Altar; but the passeouer was slaine by the housholder and all his family (as Lib. 1. 
                        
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . 
                     Philo Iudeus affirmes) without any Altar; now if our aduersaries will haue such an exact correspondency, why then should it not be as lawfull for a lay person to consecrate the host, as for a maister of euery family

to slay, dresse, and eate the Paschall Lambe; or for a multitude to consecrate and not one Priest alone.
                  Againe, it was not lawfull for an vncleane person to offer sacrifice till he had separated himselfe for some certaine season, according to the prescribed time of the ceremoniall Law; but no mans vncleannesse ought to exclude him from he

                  Againe, the Iewes after the edifying of the Temple sacrificed not out of Ierusalem; yet were they accustomed in all their remouings from place to place, to eate the Paschall Lambe in the moneth appointed;

                  But Bellarmine to proue the Passeouer alleadgeth Marke 14. 12. 
                     Marke 14. 12. When they sacrifice the Passeouer. But we must obserue that it is called a sacrifice Katati, after a sort, because it was slaine as the other sacrifices; and because it was a spirituall sacrifice: for the word Zebach which signifies a sacrifice killed, is often vsed about the ceremony of the Paschall Lambe, because it was killed as other sacrifices; and is vsed also sometimes largely for a spirituall sacrifice, as Psalme 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 17. 
                     The Sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.
                  
                  But let it be granted that the Paschall Lambe was a Sacrifice, yet no otherwise then Eucharisticall for the remembrance of the great and admirable deliuerance of the Iewes out of Egypt. Yea, if we grant

it to be propitiatory it helpes them not, but rather disaduantageth them in their practise; for if they will haue the Paschall Lambe to be a figure of the Masse, how comes it to passe that the former was offered with blood, this without, the one by the whole family, the other onely by the Priest; of the former nothing was to be reserned, but they reserue the host to be kept in the pyx; the former was not to be carried forth of the house; but the host is carried about in the streetes to be worshipped and adored.
                  Neither do the fathers compare the Paschall Lamb to the Eucharist or Lords Supper but onely in these three respects; first, that as the Iewes did eate the one, so do Christians the other. Secondly as the Paschall Lambe did represent Christum moriturum, Christ which was to die; so the Lords Supper doth represent Christum mortuum, Christ which hath dyed. Thirdly, as the one was in commemoration of the bodily deliuerance of Israell out of Egypt; so is the other in commemoration of our spirituall redemption out of the iawes of Satan.
                  Touching the first, namely, the eating of the Paschall Lambe, and the feeding on Christ in the Sacrament; Chrysostome speaks, Hoc mysterium tradidit, &c. Chrys. hom. 83. in Math. 
                     Hee deliuereth this mystery, when the Law was to cease, and he dissolueth their principall solemnity, to wit, of the Paschall Lambe; and cals them to a terrible Table, saying, Take eate, this is my body. Where note that he calles it a Table to be trembled at, not because of the reall presence of Christ there, as the Papists expound it, but because of worthy or vnworthy communicating.

                  Secondly, they compare it to the Eucharist in representing Christ. Tertullian, Our Lord hauing declared that he desired to eate his Passeouer (for it was indignity 
                     Cont. Marcion lib. 4.
                      
                     for the Lord to desire any thing but his owne) gaue and distributed it to his Disciples, and made it his body, saying, this is my body, that is a figure of my body. Thomas their owne Angelicall Doctor sayth, Seeing Christ our Passeouer is offered let vs feast, feeding

                     on Christ not onely Sacramentally, according to that of St. Iohn, If you eate the flesh of the sonne of man, &c. but also spiritually by enioying his wisedome.
                  
                  Lastly, they are compared, in respect of commemoration. Lyra. Exod. c. 12.
                      So Lyra. All whatsoeuer Moses hath written hath relation to Christ, and therefore in the sacrificing of the Lambe there is a double sence; the one is the state of the people comming out of Egypt, & this is the litteral and first sence; the other is the fore-shewing and shadowing out of Christ, who was to be crucified; and this is the first in intention, though last in accomplishment. By which allegations, it appeares plainly, that the ancients seldome or neuer call the Paschall Lambe a sacrifice, and in what respects they compare it to the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper.
                  And thus much for answere vnto the second argument.
                  
                     
The third argument which is alleadged by the Romanists, Argum. 3.
                      and whereupon they most depend is grounded on the prophesie of Malachy, chap. 1. 11. For from the rising of the Sunue, to the going downe of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in euery place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering; for my name shall be great among the Heathen, saith the Lord of Hoasts. Seeing the sacrifice of the Masse is so generally offered among all Gentiles: therefore it must needs be that pure oblation foretold by the Prophet Malachy. And that this Sacrifice may the better appeare, Bellarmine alleadgeth these reasons.
                  First, from the signification of the Hebrew word Mincha, which properly betokeneth an externall Bellar. cap. 10.
                      Sacrifice made with oyle and incense, and therfore cannot be vnderstood of Spirituall and internall sacrifices.
                  Secondly, it is called a pure offering, such as cannot be polluted; but prayers may be polluted, onely the sacrifice of the Masse cannot bee defiled by the illnesse of the Minister.
                  Thirdly, the Prophet speaketh of such an offering as was not in vse among the Iewes, saying, I will not accept any offering at your hands, but spirituall sacrifices Verse 10.
                      were in vse among them.
                  Fourthly, the Prophet speaketh directly to the Priests, Thus saith the Lord of Hoasts vnto you, oh ye Priests; and reproouing their sacrifices, bringeth in a Verse 6.
                      new kind of offering, which a new Priesthood should offer to God, which cannot be meant of spirituall sacrifices.
                  
                     
To these we answer: That the intent of the Lord by the Prophet is to oppose the Gentiles against the Answere. Iewes, and shew the difference betweene the Leuiticall sacrifices which they defiled, and the spirituall sacrifices which should bee offered not by one nation onely, but by euery people vnder the new Testament. Wherefore the Prophet doth comprehend the whole 
                        
                           〈◊〉

                           〈◊〉
                        Dei externo. seruice of the Christian Church vnder these three heads.
                  1. The knowledge of God by the preaching of the Gospell.
                  2. Inuocation or calling vpon the name of the Lord by prayer.
                  3. Liberality towards the poore in workes of charity.
                  The first is shewed in these words, From the rising of the Sunne to the setting of the same, my name shall bee great among the Gentiles.
                  
                  The second in these words, and in euery place incense shall be offered to my name.
                  
                  The third is signified by the word Mincha, or a pure oblation; for as Zanchius obserues by the names Ibid. of bread and wine all beneficence and liberalitie is signified in the Scripture. So Iacob calls the Present, hee Gen. 33. 11. 1. Sam 25.27. sent his brother Esau Mincha; and Abigail the present she brought to Dauid by the same name. But I tye not my selfe precisely to this exposition of Zanchius vnderstanding by Mincha, Beneficence, or Liberality.
                  Therefore I answer to Bellarmin that if he will haue Mincha vnderstood properly and not 
                        〈◊〉
                     , then it would follow that the Prophet did speake

in that place of the Iewish ceremonies which should bevsed among Christians, but with more purity then among the Iewes: but the Papists confesse that hee speaketh not of Iewish sacrifices, but of the sacrifices of Christians.
                  Againe, if he will haue Mincha to bee vnderstood Metaphorically, then the Masse is but figuratiuely a sacrifice, and not properly; at most it will bee but flower or bread without any Transubstantiation, as Mincha was. And whereas Bellarmine inferreth that because Mincha signifieth properly an offering of flower or bread with oyle and incense: therefore it cannot be vnderstood of the spirituall sacrifices of Christians, how vnschollerlike (and therefore how vnlike himselfe) doth hee argue? Who knowes not that many things are spoken figuratiuely, being applyed improperly from their natiue significations to signifie things which indeed they are not, I am a doore (saith Christ) I am the vine; if these things be vnderstood literally and not Metaphorically, we shall make but a bad construction. But an example like this of the Prophet Malachy, may bee that of the Prophet Esay, where speaking of the Church of Christ among the Gentiles he faith, And they shall bring all your brethren 
                     Esay 66.20. 
                     for an offering to the Lord out of all nations vpon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, vpon mules, and vpon swift beasts, vnto my holy mountaine Ierusalem saith the Lord; as the children of Israell bring an offering in a cleane vessell to the house of the Lord. What must all Christians be properly slaine and offered as sacrifices to the Lord or figuratiuely? or must they be brought to the terrestriall, or to the spirituall and celestiall Ierusalem?
                  
                     
But Bellarmine vrges that the Prophet speakes of a pure offering which cannot be polluted, but spirituall sacrifices may be defiled by the offerer.
                  I answer, No holy action, as prayer, preaching, mortification, prayses, Almes-deeds, and the like, are sacrifices but onely as they are offered in and through Iesus Christ, so that in respect as they proceed from vs simply, they may bee defiled by our inherent corruptions, yet being offered through Christ they are pure and holy; for as our Sauiour telleth vs, it is the

                           〈◊〉
                        to God continually. So the Heb 13.15.

                        Pet. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . 5. Apostle Peter calls the faithfull, An holy Priesthood to offer vp spirituall sacrifices by Iesus Christ. So that our spirituall sacrifices being offered on Christ our Altar cannot be contaminated by our sinnes.
                  Thirdly, whereas Bellarmine would perswade vs that the Prophet speaketh of such an oblation as was not in vse among the Iewes; we deny it, for he speaketh not of any new kind of oblation, but makes a difference betweene the impurity of the Iewish sacrifices, and the pure offerings of Christians, the one being offered with disdaine, the other with true faith in Christ. And it appeares that the Prophets reproofe extendeth it selfe as well vnto the people as to the Priests, verse 14. Cursed be he that 
                           〈◊〉

                     voweth, and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing. Thus the people were blamed for bringing polluted bread, for offering the blind, the lame, and the sicke

for oblations to God; and the Priests were blamed for accepting of such impure sacrifices.

                      of Ireneus, Iustine Martyr, and Augustine, who haue applyed this place vnto the bread and the cup in the Eucharist or Lords Supper.
                  We deny not that it may be applyed vnto the Sacrament of the Supper, but therefore it followes not, that thereby is giuen sufficient ground for the instituon of a Sacrament; and yet admit this were a sufficient foundation whereon to build the institution of the Eucharist, yet not therefore of the sacrifice of the Masse, seeing (as I shall hereafter shew) there is irreconcilable difference betweene the holy Supper of our Lord Christ, and the blasphemous sacrifice of the Idolatrous Masse; and doubtlesse these Fathers that applyed this place vnto the Eucharist, neuer dreamed of any true reall Propitiatory sacrifice which should be offered by the Minister in the administration of the Sacrament, as appeares sufficiently by all their writings.
                  Moreouer (as one well obserued) if our aduersaries Sadeel deuni. Christi sacrif. will haue this place vnderstood literally, then must the Priests of Rome not be after the order of Melchizedech, but after the order of Aaron; for the Prophet speaking of the same sacrifice, chap. 3. vers. 3. sayes that Christ at his comming shall purifie the sonnes of Leui, they shall be Leuiticall, but onely purified: but they will not grant themselues to be after the order of Aaron, but they are there called Leuites by the way of allusion (say they) assimulating them vnto the priests of the Law: but if they admit of a figuratiue 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     
in the persons offering, why not as well in the sacrifice offered?
                  I will conclude this answer with laying before your eyes the common consent first of the Prophet Dauid, and the Euangelist S. Iohn the Diuine, and the Apostle Paul; then of the Fathers of the Church in succeeding ages.
                  
                     Dauid vnderstands it of prayer and supplications, Let my prayers come before thee as the incense, and the 
                     Psal 141. 2. 
                     lifting vp of my hands as the euening sacrifice, where the Prophet vseth the same word Mincha, which is vsed by Malachy; the one place giuing most cleere light vnto the other; for by incense is plainely meant praier, and by the pure oblation the lifting vp of the hands.
                  Thus the beloued Disciple of Christ expounds what is meant by this incense: And another Angell came and stood at the altar, hauing a golden censer, and there was giuen to him much incense, that he might offer 
                     Reu. 8. 3. 
                     it with the prayers of the Saints vpon the golden Altar. This Angell is Christ (as is shewed formerly) the censer is his humanity, the incense is his righteousnes, wherby our spirituall sacrifices of prayer and prayses haue their acceptance in the eyes of God. This place of Malachy may also seeme to be expounded by that of Paul. 
                     1. Tim. 2. 8. 
                     I will therfore that men pray euery where, lifting vp pure hands without wrath and doubting.
                  
                  Thus haue we the consent of Scripture; let vs see also the agreement of Fathers. Tertullian citing this Tertul. con.

                      place expounds it of spirituall sacrifices, which being pure, hee opposeth to the impure sacrifices of the Iewes; and in his booke against Marcion, he expounds

it of glorifying, and praysing God, and of prayer proceeding Contra Marc. l. 3. pag. 212. & l. 4. pag. 223.

The Prophet Malachy signifies nothing hereby, but that neither definitiuely at Ierusalem nor any other place, but in euery region, the Gentiles shall offer the incense and sacrifice of prayer (to di, euchôn thumiama) vnto God which is called a cleane sacrifice, not by blood, 
                     Tertul. aduers. Iudeos. 
                     but by godly actions. Tertullian also expounds it of the preaching of the Gospell among all nations. And so Hier. in Esa. ca. 52.
                      
                     Hieronim. vpon Esay saith, The sound of the Apostles is gone throughout all the ends of the world, euery where there is sacrifice offered to God: And herein is accomplished the word of the Prophet, namely in this, that God is purely preached, and purely called vpon in euery place. Theodoret expounds it of the abolishing the Iewish Theod. in 1. Mal sacrifices, and of the seruing of God in spirit and truth, as our Sauiour af firmeth in his speech vnto the woman of Samaria.
                  
                  And whereas they obiect some Fathers who haue vnderstood it of the Eucharist, wee haue alleadged both the same Fathers and others with them expounding it otherwise.

                     offerre Deo, sicut Salomon ait, qui miseretur pauperis foeneratur Deo. Christ giuing counsell vnto his Disciples to offer vnto God the first fruits of his creatures, not as of any necessity in God, but that they might not be vnfruitfull or vngratefull, tooke that which by creation is bread, and gaue thankes, saying, This is my body, &c. teaching that in the new Testament, there is a new oblation; which the Church taking from the Apostles offereth throughout the whole world vnto God, the first fruits of his gifts in the new Testament, to him that giueth

whatsoeuer food and nourishment we haue, which Malachi foretold.
                  There is no question but Ireneus here speakes of the Lords Supper: but is there one word which can intimate any Propitiatory sacrifice? No, hee calls it an offering in two respects.
                  First, that wee might not seeme vngratefull vnto God, but should offer the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiuing.
                  Secondly, that we should not be vnfruitfull, and therefore should offer vnto God our first fruits, according vnto the ancient Custome of the Christians, who were wont at the celebration of the Lords Supper to send their offering, whereof part was taken to furnish the table with bread and wine; a second part was distributed to the poore; and a third part went to prouide necessaries for the Church: so that here is mention made of an Eucharisticall, but not of a Propitiatory sacrifice; of the offering of fruits and things without life, and not of the reall offering of our Lord Iesus Christ; of a solemne thankesgiuing for good things receiued, and not of any atonement or pacification of Gods wrath for sinnes committed. And what this incense is whereof Malachi speaketh, Ireneus 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , saying, Euery where incense and pure sacrifices 
                     
                        c. 33. 
                     are offered to my name; Saint Iohn in the 
                           〈◊〉
                        hath called the prayers of the Saints, the offering of incense.
                  
                  
                     And againe, In as much as the Church offereth in

                        c. 34. and singlenesse of heart, her offering vnto God is by good right reputed a pure and vndefiled sacrifice, as Saint Paul saith to the Philippians, I was filled hauing

receiued of Epaphroditus the things which you sent, an odour of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God, for it behooueth that we offer vp 
                        〈◊〉
                     sacrifices to God, that 
                        〈◊〉
                     all things we may be found thankefull. And this offering hee further makes plaine by that which followes, saying, We offer vnto him, not because he standeth in 
                        〈◊〉
                     , but that we may be thankefull vnto him for his gifts, and so by this meanes sanctifying the creature: for as God hath no need of any thing proceeding from 
                        〈◊〉
                     , so hau we need to offer vnto him, according to that which Salomon saith, Hee that 
                        〈◊〉
                     the poore, lendeth to the Lord.
                  Now in all this place which they make so sure a ground for their sacrifice of the Masse, where is one word of sacrificing Christ, or of any Propitiatory host? yea rather doth not Ireneus directly specifie a sacrifice of thank 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and of charity, in as much as that which is giuen to God, is giuen to the vse of our neighbour, and that which is giuen to the poore is sacrificed to God.
                  Secondly, they 
                        〈◊〉
                     that of Iustine Martyr, 
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        Martyr 
                           〈◊〉
                        . cum Tryp. where he calleth the bread and wine the sacrifices of the Eucharist. His words are these, We are truely made the Priests of God, according to that which he witnesseth himselfe, because that throughout the whole world there are offered vnto him pure and

                        , He tooke bread to make the Eucharist in remembrance of his passion. But to what end? To offer for a propitiatory sacrifice? No, but he declares the reason, Vt gratias agamas Deo tum pro eo quod mundum cum omnibus, hominis gratia condidit: tum ob id 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                     
                     
quod ab omni in qua fuimus malitia nos liberauit, ac principatus potestatesque perfecta occiderit occidione, per eum qui de consilio & voluntate eius factus est patibilis, That we should render than kesvnto God, as well for that he that created the world, and 
                        〈◊〉
                     that is therein, for the vse and benefit of man: as also for that hee hath deliuered vs from all the malice whereunto wee stood subiect, and hath slaine with a perfect slaughter the principalities and powers which did oppresse vs, by him who by his will and counsell was made to suffer.
                  Out of which words the most subtle Papist is not able to prooue either directly or by consequence that Iustine alloweth in the Eucharist any Propitiatory sacrifice, but onely Eucharisticall and of thankesgiuing. And therefore Langus is condemned by the Index expurg. pag. 75.
                      Councell of Trent to bee raced, because hee hath not expounded this place after their manner.
                  Thirdly, they 
                        〈◊〉
                     that Augustine expoundeth Cont. aduers. leg & proph. l. 1. c. 20.
                      this place of the sacrifice of Melchizedech, and applyeth it to the Eucharist. Wee grant it. But the words following declare that both the sacrifice of Melchizedech (if it may be granted that he sacrificed bread and wine) and the Lords Supper are both but sacrifices of prayse and thankesgiuing, his words be these. Ecclesia immolat Deu in corpore Christi sacrificium laudis, &c. The Church sacrificeth to God in the body of Christ the sacrifice of prayse, seeing the God of Gods hauing 
                           〈◊〉
                        , hath called the earth from the sunne rising vnto the setting thereof: for this Church is the spirituall Israell, 
                           〈◊〉
                        from the carnall Israell, which serued God in the shadowes of sacrifices, in which was signified and 
                           〈◊〉
                        forth this singular sacrifice, which Israell according
                     
to the spirit now offereth. Out of the house of this Israel he hath not taken any calues; for in it are offered, and sacrificed vnto God the sacrifice of prayse.
                  Where we see manifestly that Augustine shewing the difference between the sacrifices of the Iewes, and of the Christians declares the Iewes to haue onely the shadowes of the sacrifice of Christ, but vs to haue the true sacrifice, which wee celebrate with praise and thankesgiuing. And he addeth afterward, saying, In euery place incense is offered to my name; And Saint Iohn expoundeth it in the Apocalyps, the prayers of the Saints. 
                     Ibid.
                  
                  Thus haue wee hunted them out of their chiefest starting hole, euen this place of Malachi, clearing it from all pretence of the sacrifice of the Masse both by consent of Scripture and of the Fathers; as also freeing the obiected testimonies of the Ancients from their corrupt expositions.
                  The fourth argument follows. And it is Bellarmines, 
                     Argum. 4.
                      who argues thus against vs for the maintaining of his Sacrifice. If the Fathers had thought that the Eucharist 
                     Bellar. l. 1. de 
                           〈◊〉

                     were a Sacrament onely and not a sacrifice also (meaning Propitiatory) they could not haue spoken otherwise of the Eucharist then of Baptisme; but the Fathers neuer call baptisme a sacrifice, or say, that to baptize is to sacrifice. Therefore the word Sacrifice was vsed by the Fathers in a proper sence.
                  Whereby he doth clearely grant that the word Sacrifice attributed by the ancient Fathers vnto the Eucharist, may be interpreted Metaphorically, if once it could be shewed, that the same Fathers haue applyed the same word Sacrifice vnto the Sacrament of Baptisme.

Otherwise their Iesuite Suarez, would not so Suarez

                  Seeing then the parallell of Baptisme may giue our aduersaries their demanded satisfaction, we desire August. tom. 4. expos. ad Rom. pag. 1185.. vsq ad 1187.

Vnto them that sinne voluntarily, after they haue obtained the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinne, sayth, Illud ad Hebreos diligentius qui pertractant, sic intelligunt, vt non de sacrificio contribulati per paenitentiam cordis accipiendū sit quod dictum est (non adhuc pro peccatis relinquitur Sacrificium:) sed de Sacrificio de quo tunc loquebatur Apostolus, id est, Holocausto dominicae passionis; quod eo tempore offert quisque pro peccatis suis, quo eiusdem passionis fide dedicatur, et Christianorum fidelium nomine baptizatus imbuitur, vt hoc significaret Apostolus, nempè, non posse deinceps eum qui peccauer it, iterum baptizando purgari., &c. That it is not to be vnderstood of a sacrifice of a troubled spirit by repentance, but of that sacrifice wherof the Apostle spake, that is, that the Holocaust or burnt offering of the Lords Passion, which euery one offers at that time for his sinnes, when he is dedicated by faith in the same passion, and being baptized is endued with the name of a faithfull Christian, that the Apostle might signifie thus much; That he that sinned,
                     
                     could not afterward by baptisme bee purged. And let Sal. les. in Heb. 10. disp. 19.

                  And to the end they may rest sufficiently satisfied, they may be contented to consult with their learned Reader of Spaine, who renders the reason why most of the fathers did call Baptisme a sacrifice; which they did (sayth he) Metaphorically, that is, figuratiuely his

And how could our aduersaries doubt that the fathers Riber Iesu. com. in Heb. 6.

Where we see their owne Doctor agreeing with Augustine, and we consent with them both in this that the Eucharist may bee called a sacrifice, as a Picture may be called by the name of the thing which it representeth.

                     Argument which they alleadge followes, Argum. 5. Esay 61. 6. and 66. 21. & 56. 7.
                      and it is grounded on the words of Esay, But yee shall be named the Priests of God. Againe, And I will also take of them for Priests, and for Leuites sayth the Lord. And, Them will I bring vnto my Holy mountaine and make them ioyfull in the house of Prayer, their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shalbe accepted vpon mine Altar. This (say they) must bee vnderstood of the Christian Church, wherein the Prophet Esaias fore-telleth, that there shalbe externall Priests, Altars, and Sacrifices, whereby must needes be vnderstood the sacrifice of the Masse.
                  We answere, first by deniall of the consequence; for, because the Prophet sayth, there shall be in the Church of Christ, Priests, Altars, Sacrifices, therefore it must be an externall Priest-hood, materiall Altars, proper sacrifices; this is a plaine Non sequitur.
                     
For who sees not that the Prophet expressing the VVorship of God vnder the Gospell alludes vnto the ceremonies of the Law; and by an externall Legall Priest-hood, and sacrifice, figuratiuely intimates that which is Spirituall and Euangelicall.
                  Now from things that are spoken Metaphorically and allusiuely, to inferre a proper and direct conclusion is no good forme of arguing: For it is the opinion of their greatest Schoole-man,

                     non esse argumentatiuam. That Symbolicall, Metaphoricall, or Allegoricall testimonies prooue nothing. And if wee will not vnderstand these and the like speeches figuratiuely, but litterally, then must all Christian Churches be raced downe, and we must be constrained to build Ierusalem againe, to reedifie the Temple, to erect a new Altar, to seeke Priests out of the Linage of Leui, according vnto the words of the Prophets, and so there should not in euery place be offered a pure oblation, (according to that of Malachie) but onely at Ierusalem; nor of any of the Gentiles, but onely of the Iewes. Wherefore when Esaias sayth, Ye shall be called the Priests of God, Hee meanes not the Masse-Priests of Rome; but hee speakes of the godly whom Peter calles a Royall 
                     1 Peter 2. 9. 
                     Priest-hood.
                  
                  And it is to be obserued that all those who are not Priests in this sence, the Prophet calls them strangers, and accounts them as the sonnes of Forrainers: For all that are not holy to the Lord, being called to the sacred Priest-hood of the new couenant, are deemed but as men without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth 
                     Eph. 2. 12.
                     
                     of Israel, Strangers from the couenants of promise, hauing no hope, and being without God in the world; but this our aduersaries note not.
                  Againe, the Prophet doth not establish the Iewish rites and ceremonies, but by them shadowes Esay 19. 19. forth the Christian worship. So Esay prophecied that there should be an Altar in the middest of Egypt, and a publicke profession of true Religion, but it cannot be spoken of the Romish Altars, or Massing-Sacrifice. So prophecying of the spirituall worship of the Church of Christ, he sayes, All the flockes of Cedar shalbe gathered together vnto thee, the Rams of Nebaioth shall minister vnto thee, they shall come vp with acceptance vpon mine Altar, and I will glorifie the 
                     Esay 60. 7. 
                     house of my glory. Who is so ignorant as once to iudge, that these things are properly spoken, and litterally to be vnderstood? or once to thinke that that there should be any bloody sacrifices of beasts and cattell in the Church of Christ? St. Iohn in his Apocalyps mentions in Heauen, an Altar, Incense, Censers, Temple, Arke of the Couenant.
                  What sound Christian abhorres not from so grosse an interpretation, as to thinke these things to be materiall, and so to be litterally vnderstood? and not rather that the Prophet, Apostle, and Euangelist speake allusiuely, both in the names and things, comparing, the spirituall worship of the Church Militant, and the glorious state of the Church Tryumphant vnto the ceremoniall worship of the Leuiticall Priesthood. And that the former places are thus to be interpreted the consent of the Fathers will manifestly declare.
                  
                     
                     Cyprian sayes, All Christians do offer vnto God a

All the rest of the Antients agreeing hereunto in the exposition of the former places; so that from them the Papists can collect no pretence for either sacrifice or Priest-hood.
                  In the next place they assault vs with those proofes 
                        Argum. 6. of Daniel chapt. 8. 11. and chapt. 11. 31. and chap. 12. 11. where the Prophet (say they) foretelleth that Antichrist shall cause the dayly sacrifice to cease which (say they) is the sacrifice of the Masse.
                  Herevnto we answere by shewing two errours in this Argument.
                  First, in that they apply the places to the times of Antichrist.
                  Secondly, that they by a false consequence will haue this iuge sacrificium, dayly sacrifyce, to be the sacrifice of the Masse.
                  For the first, he who should cause the dayly sacrifice to cease is not Antichrist, but was vnderstood of Antiochus Epiphanes, hee was that little horne foretold chap. 8. 9. who came of the stocke of Seleucus

                     Nicanor, who was one of those to whom the fourth part of Alexanders mighty Monarchy was diuided. For the Goate spoken of in this Chapter, is the Grecian
                     
                     Monarchy; that one horne was Great Alexander, which horne, being broken by death, there arose foure hornes: the Monarchy was diuided into foure parts, whereof Seleucus Nicanor had one, (of whose stocke came forth this little horne, Antiochus Epiphanes) he raigned in Syria; Ptolemeus another, who was created King of Egypt. Antigonus had the Kingdomes of Asia; and Cassander commanded Greece, and Macedony.
                  
                  And that Antiochus Epiphanes was of the stocke of Seuleucus Nicanor, appeares by his pedigree, for he was the sonne of Antiochus the Great, who was the sonne of Seleucus Callinicus, who was the sonne of Antiochus Theos, who was the sonne of Antiochus Soter, who was the sonne of Seleucus Nicanor; and he is called a Little-horne, because he was the yongest of his brethren, and so most vnlikely to attaine the Kingdome, but being left a pledge vnto the Romans at Rome he escaped thence, and returned into Syria, where (his brother Seleucus surnamed Philopator being vnfit for the gouernment) hee obtained the Kingdome.
                  In his second expedition against Ierusalem, hauing taken the City, he caused the bookes of the Scriptures to be burnt, the dayly sacrifice to cease for the space of two thousand and three hundred dayes, which make six yeares, three moneths and a halfe, and caused an Idoll of the Gentiles to be set vp in the Temple, and worshipped of the Iewes, which was the abhomination of desolation prophecied by Daniel; which Idoll stood in the Temple a thousand two hundred and ninety dayes; which make three

yeares six months, and odde dayes; so that hee began his raigne in the 137. yeare of the Grecian Monarchy (the beginning whereof was reckoned from the

This was in the 348 yeare after the Babilonian captiuity, and 152 yeares before the natiuity of Christ. And this is sufficient to cleare this place of Scripture from the misinterpretation of our aduersaries, who against all reason would haue it applyed to the times of Antichrist.

                  I do not deny but that Antiochus was a type of Antichrist, for as the former set vp an Idoll in the Temple, so this latter sets vp images in the Church; the one burnt the Scriptures, the other conceales them from the lay people; the first hindred the dayly sacrifice, and this latter hath conuerted the great sacrifice of Christ into an abhomination, in that the Priest must offer a propitiatory sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead, greater abhomination then this was not in the dayes of Antiochus.
                  
                  Secondly, let vs grant that this prophesie is to be fulfilled in the dayes of Antichrist; yet how shall it be prooued that this Iuge sacrificium, dayly sacrifice, is the sacrifice of the Masse? Let this bee first prooued, and wee shall soone yeelde the cause. In the originall there is no mention made of a sacrifice, but the word Iuge, daily, without any substantiue; must there needes be vnderstood sacrifice? why then doth Ierome call it Iugem cultum, the dayly Worship of

But let vs grant it is to be vnderstood of the Eucharist, and that this is called a sacrifice; but how any other then Eucharisticall, or of thankesgiuing? but let it be granted to bee vnderstood of the Lords Supper, and it is called a Propitiatory sacrifice: how any otherwise then by representation? how any otherwise then of commemoration? Thus the ground whereon they build, shrinkes from them, as refusing to become a foundation for such a tottering fabricke.
                  But against this interpretation of our Antagonists, let vs oppose Socratically, and by the way of interrogation, desiring them to answer to these demands.
                  First, why doth not the Apostle Saint Paul. 2. The. 2. and Saint Iohn the Apostle and Euangelist. 1. Ioh. 4. 3. Reuel. 17. and 18. in their description of Antichrist, make mention of this place of Daniel, or of taking away for a time this Iuge sacrificium, dayly sacrifice; or hindering the sacrifice of the Masse? Doubtlesse, had Daniell spoken of Antichrists taking away the sacrifice of the Masse, the Apostles would not haue either forgotten, or willfully pretermitted so great a matter. But by their forgetfulnesse, we may conceiue the Masse not to be worth remembring; or by their voluntary omission, we may iudge it indigne and vnworthy to be spoken of.
                  
                     
Secondly, I demand how Christ is euer with his Church vnto the end of the world? Turrian answers for all the rest, Christ is with vs in the mystery of the

                     Masse; but then I require againe, whether Antichrist shall take away the Masse for a thousand two hundred and ninety dayes? Turrian and with him Vega answer, saying, Gabriel that cannot lye, saith that Antichr ist shall abolish and put downe the continuall sacrifice; and what other thing is that but the Masse, say they. See now how our subtle aduersaries haue entangled themselues; for how can Christ be euer with his Church in the sacrifice of the Masse, when the sacrifice it selfe of the Masse (by their owne confession) shall bee abolished by Antichrist for the space of three yeares and six moneths?
                  
                  Thirdly, I demand whether that Iuge sacrificium, dayly sacrifice be meant properly or Metaphorically? if properly, then the sacrifice of the Masse is Iudaicall; then ought it to bee offered onely in one place, and that euery day, morning and euening, which our Romish Priests obserue not. If Metaphorically, why then doe they vrge the verity and reality of a Hilasticke or Propitiatory sacrifice? or why doe wee not agree and consent that it is Propitiatory by resemblance?
                  Lastly, if Antichrist shall abolish the sacrifice of the Masse for the space of three years and sixe months, then I demand, how shal there remaine in the Church of Rome a continuall and constant succession neuer to bee interrupted? Seeing by their owne consessions, hee shall make interruption both of sacrifice and Priesthood.
                  Herein are our aduersaries contrary to themselues,

as they are alwayes contrary to the truth.
                  Diuers other arguments are alleadged by them, but these are the principall; and seeing their strongest testimonies are so infirme and weake, I thinke it wil be supervacaneous and vnnecessary to trouble my selfe in giuing answer to those which are more friuolous, hauing the lesse pretence and shew of reason.
                  Wherefore thus much shall serue for the third part of this confutation, namely the answering of their obiections.
                  
                     
                        Argument. 1.
                     The fourth and last part now followes, wherein wee shall lay downe arguments sufficiently proouing our owne opinion, that in the Masse there is not a true reall Propitiatory sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead, and therefore not lawfull to be vsed in the Church of God. And this is prooued.
                     First, that sacrifice which is al-mighty, al-sufficient, and absolutely perfect, in respect of the desired end cannot be reiterated by men; But the sacrifice of the the immaculate Lambe Iesus Christ vpon the crosse was almighty, al-sufficient, and absolutely perfect in respect of the desired end which is the saluation of the faithfull. Ergo. The al-sufficient and perfect sacrifice of Christ cannot be reiterated in the Masse.
                     The Maior is confirmed by the words of the Apostle, The law which had a shadow of good things to come, 
                        Heb. 10. 1. 2. 
                        and not the very image of the things, can neuer, with those sacrifices which they offered yeare by yeare continually,
                        
                        make the commers thereunto perfect; for then, should they not haue ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged, should haue had no more conscience of sinnes. What doth the Apostle conclude here? He opposeth the Gospell to the law; our Soueraigne Priest Christ Iesus, against the Priests of Aaron; his sacrifice which had no need to be renewed, against their sacrifices repeated euery day; the holinesse and effectuall sanctifying power which was in his sacrifice, against their weakenesse and disability to sanctifie. Verse 9. Hereupon he concludeth, Hee taketh away the former to establish the latter, the sacrifices of the law, to establish his owne sacrifice.
                     Now how could this conclusion be good, if this sacrifice should be reiterated? seeing the often repetition argues weakenesse and impotency: therefore the Apostle so often vses these words once offered, to note the al-sufficiency of Christs sacrifice in the single and vnrepeated act of offering; hee hauing annihilated, and disanulled all other sacrifices whatsoeuer.
                     Wherefore the blood of Christ shed personally by himselfe, being of sufficient vertue and merit to purifie, cleanse, and redeeme all beleeuers, it must necessarily follow, that there needes no reiteration, but we may content our selues with that onely sacrifice offered vpon the crosse.
                     The Minor is so plaine and Orthodoxe that hee deserues not the name of a Christian that shall deny it.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 2.
                     Secondly, he that offereth a true Propitiatory sacrifice

for sinne must be of more value then the sacrifice it selfe; but the Priest is not of more value then the body of Christ. Ergo, the Priest in the Masse cannot offer the body of Christ.
                     The Maior is true for the gift is not accepted for it selfe, but for the worthinesse of him that offers it, as Ireneus affirmes; wherefore albeit Cains sacrifice was not of lesse worth in it selfe then Abells, yet the person of Cain being vnworthy, because of the wickednesse of his heart, his offering was reiected, but Abell beeing more worthy then his oblation in regard of his faith, the Lord had respect vnto him and to his offering; so Christ as Priest was God and man, and therefore of more merit and efficacy then his humane nature which was the onely sacrifice; for without the merit of the Godhead by which the humanity was offered, the sacrifice of Christ could not haue beene of infinite value and desert.
                     Wherefore he that presumes to offer the body of Christ truely and really vnto God the Father for a Propitiatory sacrifice for sinne; blasphemously sayes in effect, that he is of more value, worth and merit then the sacrifice he offers.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 3.
                     Thirdly, 
                           〈◊〉
                        lawfull sacrifice is grounded vpon expresse words of Scripture, whereby it may appeare that God hath instituted such a sacrifice: but there is no command in scripture for the sacrifice of the Masse. Ergo. The sacrifice of the Masle is not lawfull.
                     The Maior proposition is prooued by the words of

Christ, Invaine doe they worship me, teaching for doctrines 
                        Math. 15. 9. 
                        the commandements of men. Where our Sauiour sharpely reprehendeth the Scribes and 
                           〈◊〉
                        for teaching those things to belong to the worship of God, which were of their owne inuention, and not by Gods expresse command; for this is a true Thesis. Nothing ought to bee accounted of the substance or essence of Gods worship, but what God himselfe hath expresly commanded in his word. And for this very thing did God reprooue the Iewes; because they worshipped in Tophet, offering such kind of sacrifices as hee neuer appointed; for I spake not vnto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them forth of Egypt concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices; but 
                        Ier. 7. 30. 31. Verse 22. 23. 
                        this I said commanding them, Obey my voyce, and I will be your God, &c.
                     
                     Where first God condemned them for doing what they were not commanded, as offering their children vnto Molech in the vally of Tophet.
                     
                     Secondly, God shewes them wherein he will bee worshipped, namely in that which he expresly commandeth.
                     Therefore albeit God had commanded the sacred action of sacrificing as a part of diuine worship, yet because the Gentils in their sacrifices did not follow the prescript forme of the law of God, therefore were their sacrifices abhominable, and no other then I dolatrous.
                     The Minor proposition is perspicuous; for let all the Gospells and writings of the Apostles bee strictly suruayed, and there can neither the name, nor sacrifice of the Masse be found; for the sacrifices of the law had

their precise and prescript forme enioyned; why then if God would haue an externall sacrifice to remaine vnder the Gospell, hath hee not left vs directions for the manner? And whereas our aduersaries pretend a command in these words Do this; hereunto we haue already answered page 56.
                     Wherefore the sacrifice of the Masse hauing no ground in the new Testament, wee must needes account it fictitious, a humane inuention, and therefore to be reiected.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 4.
                     Fourthly, that sacrifice wherein there is no shedding of blood cannot bee Propitiatory. But in the Masse there is no shedding of blood. Ergo, the sacrifice of the Masse is no Propitiatory sacrifice.
                     The Maior proposition is grounded vpon the words of the Apostle, Without blood shedding there can be no remission of sinnes; and in the legall sacrifices, all that were Propitiatory were liuing creatures, which were slaine by the Priests.
                     The minor is true according to the common consent of our aduersaries, who make the Masse to be sacrificium incruentum an vnbloody sacrifice, and albeit the blood of Christ be powred out, yet it is not shed for them, in behalfe of whom it is offered, wherein they doe directly contradict themselues.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 5.
                     Fiftly, that doctrine which is contrary to it selfe is

not to be embraced in the Church. But the doctrine of our aduersaryes touching the sacrifice of the Masse is contrary to it selfe. Ergo, it is not to bee imbraced.
                     The Maior neither Protestant nor Papist will deny.
                     The Minor is prooued.
                     For our aduersaries teach that the body of Christ in the Masse is an externall sacrifice, and is truely offered vnto God the Father vnder the formes of bread and wine. And yet they teach the body of Christ to be inuisible in the sacrifice; wherein they are contrary to themselues; for no externall sacrifice is an inuisible sacrifice; neither can a sacrifice be visible (which they affirme of their sacrifice) when the thing offered is inuisible.
                     Wherefore if they will make it an externall offering, the sacrifice it selfe must be visible, but here is nothing visible (according to their Tenent) but the Altar, the Priest his ceremoniall and mimicall actions, his many hundred crossings, the accidents and outward formes; which are no part of the sacrifice. Here then their doctrine implyes a contradiction to make it a visible sacrifice, and yet the sacrifice is inuisible, it is an externall oblation, yet the matter offered is internall and cannot be discerned. Howsoeuer though no man can perceiue the matter of their sacrifice, yet euery man may perceiue the manner of their iugling.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 6.
                     Sixtly, if the sacrifice of Christ was perfectly finished

vpon the Crosse, then is it vnlawfull for any Priest to presume to offer againe this sacrifice. But the offering of the sacrifice of Christ was perfectly finished vpon the crosse. Ergo, it is vnlawfull to presume to offer this sacrifice againe in the Masse.
                     The consequence is euident. For hee that goes about to offer that sacrifice which was perfectly finished vpon the crosse, cannot but by his reiteration preiudice, and call in question the perfection thereof; for as Chrysostome speaketh, he that hath a soueraigne medicine, which by once applying is perfectly able to cure a disease, and shall often apply the same, doth derogate from the vertue thereof: so he that shall reiterate the all-sauing sacrifice vpon the crosse, by the frequent reiteration, charges it with impotency, and imbecility.
                     Wherefore whatsoeuer pretence our aduersaries may vse, they by their Massing sacrifice, doe no lesse then robbe the al-sufficient sacrifice of the Crosse, and with irreligious blasphemy derogate from it, the meritorious power to saue all that beleeue.
                     The Minor is manifest by the words of our Sauiour, he cryed Consummatum est, It is finished. What Ioh 19. 30. is finished? The Ceremoniall law was abrogated; the Morall law was fulfilled; the sacrifice of Christ was perfected; the saluation of mankind accomplished. And God forbid that against so many euidences of scripture any man should affirme the sacrifice of Christ vpon the crosse not to be perfectly finished; as though he had left any part to bee supplyed by the Masse-Priests, which hee himselfe was not able to effect.
                     
                        
Wherefore if Christ hath on his crosse cancelled the hand writing which was against vs; if hee by his crosse hath reconciled vs vnto his father; if he on the crosse did once sacrifice himselfe for all beleeuers, then God forbid any man should 
                              〈◊〉
                           in ought saue the crosse of Christ, God forbid any Christian should seeke for a Propitiatory sacrifice in the Eucharist, which hath no vertue in it to procure pardon for sinne vnto any soule; but onely faithfully receiued to seale the remission purchased by the bloody sacrifice of Christ vpon the crosse.
                     But our subtle Antagonists thinke to auoide the Sadeel. aduers. miss. sacrif. c. 3.
                         force of our argument by this cunning distinction; There is say they two degrees of remission of sinnes.
                     The first that God would for his part, and as much as in him lyes, be reconciled to men.
                     Secondly, that he would receiue them into fauour, they working by faith and repentance.
                     The first degree (say they) is in the sacrifice of Christs death on the crosse.
                     The second is in the sacrifice of the Masse; and for the confirmation of this distinction they adduce 2. Cor. 5. 19. the saying of the Apostle, God was in Christ reconciling the world vnto himselfe, not imputing their trespasses vnto them; and hath committed vnto vs the word of 
                              〈◊◊〉
                           .
                     
                     But our aduersaries, by this distinction thinking to auoid us, haue giuen vs the greater aduantage. For this latter degree of remission of sinnes is nothing els but the application of the sacrifice of Christ vnto all men; as if they should say, that, then are wee made partakers of that great benefite of Christs sacrifice,

when we doe receiue him with a true faith. And for this end was the sacrifice of the Masse instituted:
                     Vt cruenti sacrificij salutaris virtus, in remissionem Synod. Trid. corum, quae quotidie committuntur a nobis, peccatorum 
                           〈◊〉
                        ; That the sauing vertue of the bloody sacrifice may be applyed vnto vs, for the remission of those sinnes which are dayly committed by vs.
                     From hence I conclude, that if the application of a Propitiatory sacrifice bee not the sacrifice it selfe, (for he that confounds the thing and the application of that thing, shewes but weakenesse of iudgement) and that in the Masse there is an application of the great Propitiatory sacrifice offered by Christ, it must needes follow, that in the Masse there is no Propitiatory sacrifice it selfe, true, and reall, but onely an application of the great and al-sufficient sacrifice offered by Christ. Therefore the Apostle sayes, that God hath committed to vs (his ministers) the ministery of reconciliation.
                     
                     From which words I collect these two obseruations:
                     First that the Pastors of the Church of Christ are Ministers of application of Christs sacrifice; but not of sacrificing Christ himselfe.
                     Secondly, that this application is made not by sacrificing of Christ, (as our Romanists dreame) but by teaching, admonishing, and exhorting, with the administration of the Sacrament according to the institution of Christ.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument 7.
                     Seauenthly, if Christ be truely and really offered

in the Masse, then in the Masse he is really slaine: But in the Masse he is not truely and really slaine, ergo in the Masse Christ is not reall offered.
                     The Consequence appeares by this, that the offering of Christ, and the slaying of Christ are neuer seperated in the holy Scripture: For it was not with Christ, as with the beast vnder the Law, which were first slaine and then offered vppon the Altar; but Christ, in the instant of his death was offered a sacrifice of a sweet smelling sauor to his Heauenly Father.
                     Let the Scriptures be examined, and iudge whether euer they speake of the Sacrifice of Christ, but thereby is meant his death. For this he did once when he offered himselfe: How much more the blood of Christ, which by the eternall spirit offered himselfe without spot 
                        Heb. 7. 27. Heb. 9. 14. 28. 
                        to God, So Christ was once offered to beare the sinnes of many. These and all other places of the new Testament which speake of the offering of Christ are to be interpreted of his death: Wherefore to say Christus 
                              〈◊〉
                           est, Christ is offered, is nothing else but to say, Christus mortuus est, Christ is dead, or Christ is slaine, Wherefore if Christ be truely and really offered in the Masse, he must be truely and really slaine.
                     Our aduersaries answere. That there is a Sacramentall immolation of Christ in the Masse, because by the power and vertue of Transubstantiation the body of Christ is consecrated and made to subsist by it selfe, and the blood of Christ is consecrated and made to subsist by it selfe, and so though they are seperated locally and in appearance, yet they are not seperated propter concomitantiam; by concomitance they are both ioyned together.
                     
                        
By this their distinction they thinke to vp hold their Masse by which they ouer-turne it. For first, in that they say it is a Sacramentall immolation, herein they speake more truely then they are aware. wherein wee consent with them; for if it be Sacramentall it cannot be proper, reall, and externall, seeing that which is Sacramentall, is so relatiue hauing reference vnto that substance, whereof it is a shadow or resemblance. Againe, for the body and the blood to be framed seperately, and yet by concommitance not to be seperated; who heares not a contradiction in these words?
                     The Minor our aduersaries themselues confesse; they will not say Christ is slaine really and truely in the Masse, least their Priests should, become Christochthonoi, Christ Killers. Yet how can they auoid the suspition of treason against the life of Christ, when they seperate his reall body from his blood; for it is greatly to be feared that they who powre out his liuely blood, and breake his reall and substantiall body are guilty of the death of our Lord and Sauiour.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 8.
                     Eighly, If Christ be dayly sacrificed in the Masse, then Christ doth daily satisfie for our sinnes; but Christ doth not daily satisfie for our sinnes, ergo Christ is not dayly sacrificed in the Masse.
                     The consequence is plaine by euidence of Scripture; for wheresoeuer and whensoeuer Christ was to be sacrificed, it was for the satisfaction of his Fathers

wrath for sinne. Who gaue himselfe a ransom for all to be testified in due time. Hee was delinered to death 
                        1. 
                              〈◊〉
                           . 
                              〈◊〉
                           . 6. Rom. 4. 
                              〈◊〉
                           Eph. 5. 2. Rom. 4. 18. Gal. 1. 4. 
                        for our offences. Who loued vs, and gaue himselfe for vs, an offering and a sacrifice to God, of a sweete smelling sauour. If when we were enemies, we were reconciled vnto God by the death of his sonne, &c. Who gaue himselfe for our sinnes, that he might deliuer vs from this present euill world. By these and diuers other places of holy Scripture, it is plainely prooued that satisfaction for our sinnes is the end of Christs sacrifice, and in naming the one: wee suppose the other.
                     The Minor is prooued because Christ did perfectly satisfie for the sinnes of all the elect, appeasing fully the wrath of God by his sacrifice vpon the Crosse; and now ceasing from making any further satisfaction, he onely sitting at the right hand of God, maketh intercession for vs. For to satisfie the wrath of God is, to doe that for vs which wee should haue done, and to suffer that which we had deserued, namely death; and so Christ should againe yeelde obedience to the Law, and suffer death againe; but the Apostle sayth, Christ being once dead, dyeth no more; neither is Almighty God so vniust, as to require satisfaction of him that hath perfectly satisfyed already.
                     But our aduersaries say that Christ is sacrificed in the Masse to apply vnto vs the satisfaction which Christ hath giuen for vs on the Crosse. But so in applying satisfaction he makes satisfaction; for Christ cannot be sacrificed truely, but hee must truely die, and he cannot die, but to make satisfaction. Againe,

if Christ ought to be sacrificed againe, that the fruite of his sacrifice may be applyed vnto vs, then ought he as well to be incarnate againe, in the wombe of the Virgin, that the fruite of his incarnation may be applied vnto vs; to die, to be buried, to rise againe, that so the fruite of his death, Sepulture, and resurrection may be applyed vnto vs.
                     Lastly, the application of the benefit of Christs sacrifice, by reiteration of his sacrifice is not found in Scripture. But there is a double meanes, one internall, and that is the efficacie of the Spirit of God, which powerfull applies 
                           〈◊〉
                        vs the vertue of Christs sacrifice; the other is externall, namely, the Preaching of the word and the Sacraments, which two concurring together, beget faith in the soule, which particularly applies the benefit of Christs oblation to the beleeuer.
                     In a word, let them consider what applicari, to be applied signifies, and they shall easily perceiue that the sacrifice of Christ is applied vnto vs, when Christ is offered, not to God (as in the Masse) but to vs, as in the holy Eucharist; Christ freely giuing his body to be eaten, his blood to be drunke, and that spiritually by faith.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 9.
                     Ninthly, if in the Masse Christ be offered vnto God by the Priests of Rome, then hee is not the onely Priest of the new Testament.
                     But Christ is the onely Priest of the New Testament.
                     
                        
                        Ergo, he is not offered by the Priests of Rome, in the sacrifice of the Masse.
                     The consequence is true, for if there be a true and reall sacrifice in the Masse, there must needes follow a true and reall Priest-hood which offereth this sacrifice, and so Christ is not the onely Priest of the new Testament.
                     The Minor is denied by our aduersaries, but is proued by vs.
                     First, there is no other proper externall Priesthood vnder the Gospell, but that which is after the order of Melchizedech; of which order there is no man worthy, but onely Christ, as is sufficiently declared.
                     And whereas our aduersaries vainely boast their Priest-hood to be after the order of Melchizedech, herein they are contrary to Scripture, which makes this not to be a common Priest-hood, as Aarons was, but personall, belonging onely vnto Christ; wherefore the Apostle sayes, that Christ because he continueth for euer, hath [Aparabaton Hierosunen] such a 
                        Heb. 7. 24. 
                        Priest-hood as cannot passe from one to another. Where the Apostle plainly shewes that such as were mortal, and consequently not eternall, were vncapable of that order of Melchizedech; such are the Priests of Rome, mortall as those of Aaron were, and thereof vnto them cannot this Priest-hood be diuolued.
                     They thinke to cut vs off with this distinction: Christ is the primary or principall Priest; but men may be secundary and lesse principall, by whose ministery Christ may offer himselfe vnto God. I demaund then, was not Christ euen vnder the Law a

Priest after the order of Melchizedech? and were not the Priests of Aaron being compared to Christ that was to come Secundary Priests? were they not therefore Types and figures of the Priest-hood of Christ? wherefore when the primary or superior Priest was come, the Priest-hood of Aaron vanished, and the Apostle would haue no legall Priesthood to remaine. But where hath he substituted any other secundary Priests instead of the former? Certes the Scripture hath not appointed any.
                     Againe, by the same reason that the Apostle disanulles the legall Priest-hood, hath he also excluded all other externall Priest-hood vnder the Gospell, for he opposeth him that is immortall against those that are mortall, God and man, against those who are meere men: Now if the Priests of Rome be no freer from mortality, or fuller of deity then the Priests of Leuy, they are then by the same reason both excluded, for Cui ratio & perfectum medium conclusionis conuenit, eidem ipsa conuenit conclusio. To whom the true reason and perfect medium of a conclusion doth agree, to the same also the conclusion it selfe may be applied.
                     Againe, Christ is plainely manifested to be the only Priest of the New Testament, (and so alone able to offer the sacrifice of propitiaton for our sinnes,) by that figuratiue entring alone of the high Priest once a yeare into the Tabernacle.
                     Againe, he that offers a true propitiatory sacrifice, effectuall in it selfe to procure pardon for 
                           〈◊〉
                        , must needes be a Mediator of the new Testament, therefore Heb 9. 7. Heb. 8. 6. is it sayd of Christ, But now hath hee obtained a
                        
                        better ministry, by how much also he is made a Mediator of a better couenanant. And for this cause he is the

                        of the new Testament, that by meanes of death, &c.
                     
                     By which places and the like it is euident, that hee that was to be the Priest of the new Couenant was also to be the Mediatour betweene God and man; and that there is no Mediatour but onely Christ appeares 1 Tim. 2. 5. by the words of Saint Paul; For there is one God, and one Mediatour betweene God and man, the man Iesus Christ.
                     
                     Wherefore if they say they are Priests of the new Testament, they may as well say, they are Mediatours, and if Mediators, then Redeemers of the Church.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 10.
                     Tenthly, if Christ in the Sacrament be giuen vnto vs to bee receiued with truth, faith, and humble reuerence, then Christ is not offered vnto his Father by the Priest in the Eucharist, much lesse in the Masse. But he is offered vnto vs in the Eucharist.
                     
                        Ergo. Christ is not offered by the Priest vnto his Father.
                     The hypotheticall connexion appeares by the nature of those things which are opposite, for the end of Christs institution of the Supper was to exhibite himselfe vnto all beleeuers Spiritually, to be receiued Sacramentally, for the sealing and confirmation of their faith; and not to bee offered vp by any mortall vnto his Father.
                     And whereas they obiect that God gaue vnto the

Israelites sacrifices which they should offer vnto God. We answer that this exception is plaine heterogenes of another nature; for their sacrifices were corporall and externall, ours spirituall and internall.
                     The assumption is prooued by the words of Christ, Take, eate, this is my body which is giuen for you. Taking 
                        Math. 26. 16.

                           . 10. 16. doth presuppose a giuing; it is called The Communion of the body and blood of Christ. That is the communicating, and distributing of the blessed body and blood of Christ, whereof all beleeuers in common are made partakers.
                     They affirme the Eucharist to be not onely a Sacrament, out also a Propitiatory sacrifice; were deny it vpon this ground; because all expiatory sacrifices properly so called haue their complement in the most perfect and absolute sacrifice of Christ Iesus, which he offered himselfe vpon the crosse.
                     But say they, Christ sacrificed himselfe in the Eucharist, which appeares by these words, Datur, frangitur, effunditur; is giuen, is broken, is powred out; where our Sauiour speakes in the present tense, and not, shall be broken, shall be giuen, shall be powred out.
                     
                     We answer, first some of their owne writers haue denyed that Christ offered any Propitiatory sacrifice when he instituted and distributed the Eucharist, see p. 84. And he himselfe saies that his time was not fully come; namely, wherein he should be offered.

                         following, doth so render, and so is it in the Canon of the Masse.
                     Moreouer, our Sauiour might so speake not to signifie

a present sacrifice, but to intimate that his body Canon 
                              〈◊〉
                           
                         was already broken, and his blood shed in Gods determination, and his owne resolution, in which sense he is called, Agnus ab origine mundi occisus, The lambe slaine from the beginning of the world, because God had appointed him from the beginning to be the Sauiour of the world. And why might not Christ speake in the present tense, hauing respect vnto their 
                           〈◊〉
                        , whose property is to make things past, and to come to be truely present.
                     But the direct answer is, that in the words of Christ there is an Enallage temporis, the present time being set for the future; and this kind of speech is frequent in the scripture: as, Woe vnto that man by whom the Sonne 
                        Math. 26. 24. Esay 9. 6. 
                        of man is betrayed; for shall be betrayed. Vnto vs a sonne and borne of, &c.
                     And thus their owne Cardinall expounds it, saying. Euangelistae in voce praesentis effunditur; & Paulus Caietan in. 1. Cor. 11.
                            in frangitur, futuram in cruce effusionem & carnis frnctionem significarunt, &c. The Euangelists in the word (is powred out) being of the present tense; and Paul by the word (is broken) did signifie the suture effusion of his blood, and the breaking of his flesh vpon the crosse. And so Gregory de Valentia vpon these words Greg. de Valen. Iesuit. lib. 2. de sacr. Missae. c. 3. Hug. Cardinal. in Math. 26.
                         [This is my body which is giuen for you] saith, That is,, which shall be offered by mee slaine vpon the crosse. So Hugo Cardinalis vpon Math. 26. Fregit, id est, frangendum in cruce signauit, He brake (that is) he signified it to be broken vpon the crosse.
                     
                     Now who sees not the blasphemie of our peruerse aduersaries, who against the light of holy scripture, and (I thinke I may safely say against the light of

their owne conscience, dare affirme that Christ in the Lords Supper offered his transubstantiated body vnto his Father an expiatory sacrifice for the sinnes of the elect, how can they reconcile this doctrine, and the words of the Apostle, Christ offered himselfe once for all? which they can neuer effect, till they prooue Heb 9. 28. the action which Christ performed in the night before he was betrayed to bee eadem numero, the same indiuiduall action which hee did the day following; for if hee offered himselfe for sinne in the Sacrament, and offered himselfe for the same sins vpon the crosse; How can this bee true, Hee offered himselfe once for all? who sees not by their doctrine a double offering of Christ? Who perceiues not double dealing in the matter?

                     The eleuenth argument. That sacrifice which is not of diuine institution is not lawfull in the Church. But the sacrifice of the Masse is not of diuine institution.
                     Therefore the sacrifice of the Masse is not lawfull.

                     The Minor is true; for as Martin Luther exacteth of our aduersaries a demonstration of their sacrifice from the institution of Christ, wherein (as hee obserueth) We reade that Christ did distribute this sacrament vnto his disciples, but that he offered it vp in forme of a sacrifice we cannot find.
                     
                     
                        Hereunto their Cardinall Bellarmine answereth, That this manner of argument from scripture 
                           〈◊〉

                         (as thus it is not expressely set downe is scripture. Ergo it was not done) is ridiculous among schoole-boyes.
                     But if he wold take the aduise of Suarez, or stand to his owne answer, which elsewhere he himselfe hath deliuered, he would not so slightly reiect that forme ofarguing.
                     For first Suarez a Iesuite of his owne society, that hee might prooue the receiuing of the bread and the wine in the Eucharist not to bee any essentiall part of this sacrifice reasoneth negatiuely from Christ his institution thus. It is very likely that Christ instituting this sacrifice did not make it of the essence of this sacrifice

                        for the Priest to receiue, for the Euangelists negatiue authority proones it; it being probable that they relating the history of so great a mystery would not haue pretermitted so essentiall a rite thereof; who doe expresly signifie that Christ did consecrate the Eucharist, but that hee himselfe did take it they doe not report; and immediately hee

                        addes, If the Priests receiuing of the bread and wine be of the essence of the Eucharist, it ought to haue bin cleerely and plainely deliuered by the Euangelist.
                     From hence may bee collected thus much. That wbosoeuer is not expressely related by the Euangelist concerning the institution of this sacrament is not essentiall or absolutely necessary thereunto.
                     This is Suarez his confession, and as much as Luther and we desire, for if the Euangelists haue not layde downe any institution of a sacrifice, nor so much as named a a sacrifice in the Eucharist, wee ought not to embrace it; this therefore argues the malice of our aduersary Bellarmine, who calls this a ridiculous manner of reasoning in vs, which is vsed by a Doctour of his owne order not inferiour to himselfe in learning and iudgement.
                     Secondly, let vs appeale vnto the iudgement of the Cardinall himselfe, who answers in another case after the same manner; for hee reciteth the Liturgies that passe vnder the name of Saint Iames, because all things (saith he) contained in those liturgies, and in the 
                        Bellar. de Euch. l. 4. c. 13.
                         
                        liturgies of other Fathers, are not taken from the example or precept of Christ.
                     
                     Thus doth the Cardinalls argument frame it selfe: whatsoeuer in the seruice of God is not by prescript precept, or direct example of Christ confirmed, is not lawfull or warrantable; see now the partiality and philautia of the Cardinall; for what hee thinkes commendable in himselfe, he accounts ridiculous in another.
                     The Liturgie of Saint Iames is not lawfull, because it contains many things not taken either from the example

or commandement of Christ, yet we may not say, that the Masse is vnlawfull because it cannot be prooued by either example or commandement of Christ. Note here the Cardinall requires greater authority for the confirmation of a Liturgy then of their Massing sacrifice.
                     Wherefore, when they vrge the lawfulnesse of this their sacrifice, let vs reply Orthodoxally in the Cardinals owne words, Shew vs either example or commandement from Christ, and it shall 
                              〈◊〉

                     For in this tempestuous night of opposition and contention, wee haue nothing to steere our course by; but by the compasse of Scripture, and the Load-starre Christ, in whom wee are to obserue dicta & facta, his words and his actions in his institution.
                     It is not vntrue that some Romanists haue thought that Christ did name the word sacrifice or oblation Suar. Iesuit.

                         when he spake vnto his father, albeit it be not mentioned by the Euangelist, for they thought it necessary in consecration that Christ should haue vsed the words offering or sacrificing. But that had beene strange forgetfulnesse in the 
                           〈◊〉
                        to haue omitted, the maine thing which must authorize this sacrifice; and how did the spirit of the truth, lead them into all truth; if this were omitted which is the maine part of Gods seruice, and the chiefe solace of a Christian soule?
                     But we will not 
                           〈◊〉
                        them to so strict a taske as to finde in the institution of Christ, the very words of a sacrifice or oblation; it shall auaile them to proue any word tending to that purpose. Bellarmine brags

of the probate of the point, and vseth this argument. Christ offered himselfe vnder the forme of 
                        Bella. l. 1. de missa cap. 12.
                         
                        bread and wine vnto his father, and bid his Apostles do this in remembrance of him, therefore the Church may offer a sacrifice propitiatory according to Christs command, laying, Do this.
                     
                     Who sees not here a Paralogisme, or petitio principij? For he takes that for granted, which is the life of the cause; and hee supposes that Christ offered himselfe vnder the formes of bread and wine, which can neuer be proued, and therefore is vnlikely to be granted by vs, for if it can appeare that Christ at the institution of the Eucharist or Lords Supper did 
                           〈◊〉
                        his body into the bread and wine, and so did offer it vnto his father, wee shall soone yeelde, and the controuersie shall haue end. But can any man beleeue that Christ carried his whole body in owne of his hands? that he gaue it to be eaten to his Disciples, which saw him present at the Table, and heard him speaking to them, both while they were eating him, and afterward? that the same sonne of man should at once both

As though there could be any diuision of a materiall substance, but by bounds of place; or as if quantity were not both bounded and measured by place alone: Or as if that sinite body, which is in two places at once, were not first diuided in it selfe.
                     So that we demaund of Bellarmine, as once Paul did in another case, Is Christ diuided? The Papists do 1 Cor. 1. 13. not say as once of old, Behold here is Christ, or there: but which is much worse, Behold Christ is both here and there, and euery where, in his true humane nature; thus they blush not to teach impossibilities, that the selfe same body should be all here, and all not here; all visible and all inuisible; all vppon the Table, and all in Heauen; all eaten and all vneaten; all in England and all at Rome.

The actions of Christ the Scripture mentions to be foure, Hee tooke bread, He blessed it, He brake it, He gaue it. Not any one of Suar.

                         these can seeme to import a sacrifice. And whereas our aduersaries haue divided their sacrifice into fix actions, in the which of them, this sacrifice should consist, Suarez makes it doubtfull.
                     The first action is the taking of the bread, before consecration and the heauing it vp which they call the Eleuation of the host; this is not essentiall to the Suar. ibidem. Bellar. de missa. l. 1. c. 27.
                         sacrifice by the Iesuites owne confession, because it cannot be prooued neither by Scripture nor the tradition of the Church that Christ did vse it. Albeit herein he dissents from Sotus a learned Doctor who with others thought it to be vsed by Christ, and in some sort to 
                           〈◊〉
                        to the substance of this sacrifice.
                     The second action is the Consecration of the Host in the words of Christ, Hoc est corpus meum, This is 
                        Suar. ibidem 64.

                         most ancient Fathers, that those are not the words of consecration; but that the words of consecration were before those words, when Christ prayed and blessed the bread, and the cup; and therefore hee alleadgeth the perpetuall practise of the Church, from the age of the Apostles whose custome was to consecrate by prayer or benediction; as also the Liturgies of St. Iames, Clement, Basil, Chrysostome, do declare the same, being backed with the iudgement of many learned Schoole-men, to whom hee adioynes the Diuines of Colein, all agreeing consecration rather to be in the prayer or blessing of Christ, then in these words, This is my body; which hee rather accounts to be the institution then the consecration of the Sacrament.
                     The third action after the words of consecration is the Oblation vsed by the lifting vp of the Host, in these words, Be mindfull, ô Lord, &c. Concerning Suar.

Others say, it is of the essence, but not the whole essence, as Scotus, Gabriel Biel, Soto, Canus: these Suarez quoteth but differing from them all, for he affirmes it to be no essentiall part of the sacrifice, with whom agrees Bellarmine, because say they, it is not

expressed in the Scripture, neither yet is it probable other wayes, that this kinde of eleuation, or lifting vp was vsed by Christ in the institution; onely herein these Iesuites differ: Suirez will haue this eleuation to be an Ecclesiasticall rite, but Bellarmine to be Apostolicall.
                     The fourth action is the dipping of the consecrated Host into the cup; which Canus makes to bee of the substance of this sacrifice; which Suarez againe Suar.

                     Thus haue we largely and sufficiently prooued by the testimonies of our aduersaries that the sacrifice of the Masse was not instituted by Christ, and therefore (by the confession of their owne Iesuites) not to be admitted into the Church.

A true and a reall sacrifice requireth a true and reall death, or destruction of the thing sacrificed.
                     Which assertion is true in all Propitiatory sacrifices, wherein there was alwayes a destruction of the offering or sacrifice, and that by death and shedding of blood; that therein they might bee perfect figures of the great sacrifice of Christ vpon the crosse, wherein his body did shed blood, suffered death, sustained destruction, though not totall and perpetuall, yet partiall and for a season, in so much, that although hee was not consumed, yet there was in him for a time a cessation or ceasing to bee a liuing man as hee was before.
                     Our aduersarie then hauing vouchsafed vs this ground worke, we will make bold thus to build vpon it.
                     Euery thing really and properly sacrificed for propitiation doth suffer a real destruction of the substance; But the body of Christ doth not in the sacrifice of the. Masse suffer a reall destruction.
                     
                        Ergo. In the sacrifice of the Masse the body of Christ is not really and properly offered.
                     The Maior being graunted by the Cardinall, the Minor prooues it selfe thus.
                     If the body of Christ doth in the Masse suffer destruction (which to say were blasphemy) it must eyther be in whole or in part; if in whole, how come we to finde the same Christ, the same body and blood the next morning againe in the Masse? If but in part, or for a time (as it was during his beeing in the graue) then would follow that the Church for a time hath no Christ perfect God and perfect man.
                     
                        
                        Now Bellarmine affirmes that the Priests eating of the consecrated elements (which are made the body of Christ) is the destruction of the sacrifice; his words are these, Consumptio seu manducatio, quae fit a sacer dote quôd fit essentialis pars 
                           〈◊〉
                        , inde probatur, quia in tota actione missae nulla est alia realis destructio Bellar. de missa. l. 1. c, vlt. prop. 
                              〈◊〉
                           . victimae praeter istam: requiri autem realem destructionem supra probatum est, The Priests consumptionor eating of the Host is prooued to be of the essence of the sacrifice; for in the whole action of the Masse there is no destruction of the sacrifice but onely this; and that there must be a reall destrustion of the sacrifice I haue already prooued.
                     But herein how is hee constant to himselfe, who sayes, The substance of the sacrifice must suffer destruction: and yet hold againe, that the Priest consumes not the body of Christ by eating it, for it suffers no diminution, but onely the formes of bread and wine.
                     
                     Who sees not here a most palpable contradiction? for he will haue the body of Christ to be the substance of this sacrifice, and this sust ance must be consumed, or els it is no sacrifice; and yet when it comes to the push, the body of Christ suffers not destruction but only the formes. Is not this to make quidlibet ex quolibet? Is not this to make it a sacrifice and no sacrifice? Is not this to say the body of Christ is the substance of this oblation and not the substance, because it is not consumed?
                     Againe, if a Propitiatory sacrifice be as Bellarmine defines it: That which doth pacifie the wrath of God for the remission of sinnes.
                     
                     I demand then how remission of sinnes is procured?

                           〈2 pages missing〉
                        
                        
mentall presence of the Lords body and blood there is a true, reall, and actuall application of his death (quo ad meritum, in regard of the merit of it) to all that receiue with faith. But the Iesui te will haue a proper death of Christ in the Eucharist, euen as he is truely, really, substantially and corporally present; and yet see how he thwartes and crosses himselfe in the last words, saying, Christ in the Eucharist dyes not.
                     
                     Hence we may frame this Argument. After the same manner that Christ is in the Eucharist, after the same manner hee dyes in the same [for an actuall and corporall presence requires an actuall and corporall death as a sacramentall presence, a sacramental death onely] But in the Eucharist (by our aduersaries owne confession) Christ dyes not properly, actually, or bodily.
                     
                        Ergo, in the Eucharist, hee is not properly, actually, or bodily present.
                     Thirdly, note how contrary this doctrine is vnto it selfe. The body of Christ (saith he) and the blood of Christ are consecrated apart and seuerally, yet they do not subsist apart, least there should be an actuall, and reall effusion of the blood of Christ.
                     
                     But I demand, if it be so that they are consecrated and made apart, then when the Priest hath consecrated the body of Christ first (for hee cannot consecrate both in an instant) doth not that body subsist without blood, till hee hath made and consecrated the blood also? This is strange in the sacrament that the body of Christ and his blood should admit for a time, such an actuall separation as is betweene that which hath a being, and that which hath no being.
                     
                        
Lastly, note how enigmatically he tells vs of those things which are separated by consecration, and yet are indiuisibly conioyned, that they cannot be separated; contrary to the institution of Christ, who tooke the bread, and the cup seuerally, consecrating them asunder, to figure vnto vs that actuall and reall separation of the body and blood of Christ vpon the crosse.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 13.
                     The thirteenth Argument is this. That which is a Bellar. de missa l. 2. c. 1.
                         Propitiatory sacrifice for sinne, must appease and pacifie the wrath of God (this Bellarmine affirmeth.) But the sacrifice of the Masse doth not appease the wrath of God.
                     
                        Ergo, The sacrifice of the Masse is not Propitiatory.
                     The Minor is thus prooued.
                     That which doth appease Gods wrath must bee of infinite value. But the sacrifice of the Masse is not of infinite value.
                     
                        Ergo, The sacrifice of the Masse cannot appease Gods wrath.

infiniti valoris erat, non enim aliter poterat tolli peccatum & compensari iniuria Deo facta. If Aaron, or any other high Priest had offered a sacrifice, which by it owne vertue had taken away sinne, there had beene no need to haue offered any more, because all sinnes were already taken away by the former. Thou wilt say that sacrifice did take away those sinnes which were committed before it was offered, but when afterward new sinnes were committed, why may not new sacrifices be offered? No, that were but in vaine, for if by it owne proper vertue it did take away sinnes, it was then of infinite value and merit, for otherwise sinne could not bee taken away, nor the iniury done vnto God recompenced.
                     First, here he disableth the Leuiticall sacrifices, because of their often repetition and reiteration.
                     Secondly, he prooues our Maior Proposition, that nothing can appease the infinite wrath of God, and so satisfie his iustice, but that which is of infinit merit and desert; therefore all the Angells in heauen could not haue wrought mans redemption by satisfying for the sinne of Adam, but Christ himselfe: nor he, had he been meere man and not Theanthropos, God and man, for no finite creature can bee of infinite desert before God; wherefore it was necessary that the Deitie of Christ should giue efficacie, vertue, and desart vnto the humanity by the Hypostaticall vnion: which desart should be infinite, euen as the Godhead of Christ was.
                     The Minor appeares that the sacrifice of the Masse is not of infinite value or desart, by the testimony of

Theologorum, & probatur apertissimè ex vsu Ecclesiae; nam si Missae valor infinitus esset, frustra multae missae, praesertim ad rem eandem, offerrentur: si enim infiniti valoris est, certè ad omnia impetranda sufficeret, quorsum igitur aliae.

                        pro omnibus peccatis praeteritis & futuris remittendis; The vertue of the sacrifice of the Masse is finite; this is the common opinion of Diuines; and it is prooued plainely by the vse of the Church, for if the vertue or value of the Masse were infinite, it were in vaine to offer many Masses, especially for one thing; and if it were of infinite value, surely it would be sufficient to procure pardon for all sinnes, and then what needes any more Masses. And it is confirmed by the sacrifice of the crosse, which is not reiterated, because that it alone 
                           〈◊〉
                        of infinite valour or merit, and procured satisfaction for all our sinnes past, and to come
                     In these words, the 
                           〈◊〉
                        pleades our cause; for herein I note especially two things.
                     First, that the often repetition of the sacrifice of the Masse, argues that it is but of finite value and merit.
                     Secondly, that the sacrifice of Christ vpon the crosse, was onely of infinite value, desert, and merite to make satisfaction, and to procure pardon for all sinnes past and to come.
                     Wee may demand then in the Cardinalls owne words, Quorsum igitur missae? What need haue we of Masses? Seeing Christ hath accomplished our redemption by offering himselfe once for all.
                     
                     But whence proceedes this insufficiencie of the

masse? if it be the same body, and consequently the same sacrifice (as they teach) how hath it lost its vertue, that it should not be infinite in the Masse, as well as on the crosse? Bellarmine alleadgeth three reasons hereof, but so weake and infirme, as can no way beseeme a man of so great learning.
                     The first is taken from the sacrifice it selfe which is offered; for in the sacrifice of the crosse the very naturall being of Christ in his humane body was destroyed; Bellar. de missa l. 2. c. 4.
                         but in the sacrifice of the Masse, the sacramentall being of Christ onely is destroyed. But this hee affirmeth himselfe to be no cause why the one should be finite and the other infinite.
                     The second is taken from the person offering; for in the sacrifice of the crosse, the person offering is the Sonne of God immediately by himselfe; but in the sacrifice of the Masse, the person offering, is the Son of God, by the hand of the Priest. As though a mortall man could by his infirmity disable the sacrifice of Christ, and diminish the extent of that infinite oblation.
                     The third reason is taken from the will of Christ; for albeit he could by one oblation obtaine all things of God for all men, yet he would not, but the benefits of his passion, should bee obtained in a certaine measure; and if any man desire a reason hereof, it is not for vs curiously to search into it; but his will is a sufficient reason.
                     These grounds, alas, how weake are they for a Christian to build his faith vpon?
                     How shall a man bee established by such tottering foundations?

                        Argument 14.
                     The foureteenth Argument is taken from the end of a propitiatory sacrifice, and it is thus framed. A true propitiatory sacrifice doth procure remission of sinnes.
                     But the sacrifice of the Masse doth not procure remission of sinnes.
                     
                        Ergo, The sacrifice of the Masse, is no true propitiatory sacrifice.
                     The Maior is by Bellarmine himselfe affirmed, in Bellar. l. 2.

                        , to be the appeasing of Gods wrath, and the remission of sinnes. And vnto this the typicall sacrifices of propitiation in the ceremoniall Law had respect; for thereby, through faith in the 
                           〈◊〉
                        , who was the Antitype, they hoped for condonation, and were assured of remission of sinnes.
                     
                        
The first proposition, then hauing the common consent of all men, we must proue our assumption. Which our Romanists thinke a Herculean worke, Hic labor, hoc opus est.
                     
                     Now to prooue the sacrifice of the Masse, not to be auaileable to procure the pardon of sinne, we alleadge first the testimonies of our aduersaries, that so there owne tongues may fall vpon them, as the As Suarez relateth

Others directly affirmed the contrary, some hold the obtaining of this grace to be infallible; Others againe, that it is vncertaine, as Durand, Canus, Corduba.

                         reporteth) which (say they) may be pardoned without grace. Others againe are of opinion, that it is not efficatious for the pardon of any sinne, but onely, to gaine release of 
                              〈◊〉
                           punishments, the guilt whereof had beene formerly pardoned. Some thinke this is wrought by the vertue of impetration and prayer; others by the power of satisfaction and redemption.

                     How then can this sacrifice be thought fit to be vsed in the Church, which is so lacerated, and 
                           〈◊〉
                        in peeces, by the seueral opinions of so many Doctors

of great repute, who contend so stoutly for it?
                     Againe, the Apostles speakes plainly hereof, Heb. 10. 18. saying, Where remission of sinnes is, there needs 
                        Heb. 10. 18. 
                        no more sacrifice for sinnes. But who dares deny that absolute and perfect remission of offences, was purchased vnto all beleeuers by the sacrifice of Christ offered on the crosse once for all? Our aduersaries themselues dare not, nor doe not deny it, yet will they not relinquish their sacrifice of the Masse.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 15.
                     The fifteenth Argument. The Apostle sayes that Christ needes not to offer himselfe often, but now once 
                        Heb. 9. 26. 
                        in the end of the world hee hath appeared to put away 
                        Heb. 10. 14. 
                        sinne by the sacrifice of himselfe; and againe, By one offering he hath perfected for euer, them that are sanctified; From these testimonies of Scripture, I frame this Syllogisme; If Christ once in the end of the world was sacrificed to put away sinne; and by one offering hath perfected them that are 
                           〈◊〉
                        , then he is not offered in the Masse. But Christ once in the end of the world was sacrificed to put away sinne, and by one offering of himselfe once for all hath perfected them that are sanctified. Ergo, Christ is not offered in the Masse.
                     
                     
                        Bellarmine answeres, that the Apostle there speaketh Bellar. l. 1. c. 
                              
                                 〈◊〉
                              . de missa. of the bloody and painefull sacrifice of Christ vpon the Crosse which was sufficient once to bee done; but this taketh not away the vnbloody sacrifice, which is but a continuance of the former, whereby

the fruite and efficacy of the former oblation is applied vnto vs.
                     But wee are to obserue, that the Apostle by these words, excludes and cuts of all iterations of the sacrifice of Christ; for otherwise, if Christ should now be often sacrificed really, though after any manner, the difference of the Apostle could neuer stand, betweene the Leuiticall sacrifices which were often repeated, and the sacrifice of Christ, which was once offered.
                     Secondly, that is but a false distinction of a bloody and an vnbloody sacrifice, as they vnderstand it, otherwise then the fathers did; for there can be no proper vnbloody sacrifice of Christ; neither could hee be offered vp otherwise then by dying: Therefore he is not offered vp in the Eucharist because therein hee dyeth not.
                     Thirdly, we neede not inuent a new kind of sacrifice, which may apply vnto vs the efficacy of Christs death, seeing to that end Christ hath appointed the preaching of the word, and the administration of the Sacraments.
                     
                        Bellarmine replyeth: first though the death of Christ be applyed by the Preaching of the word, and Ibid. resp. ad 
                              〈◊〉
                           . 2.
                         administration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; yet it may be applyed also by the sacrifice of the Masse, which in this behalfe is not superfluous, no more then Baptisme is, by which also Christs death is applyed. Secondly, that the Apostle speaketh of the bloody, and painefull sacrifice of Christ vpon the Crosse, it appeareth by the words following, For then he must haue often suffered.
                     
                     
                        
But we cut off Bellarmines answere, by affirming; That albeit both the Eucharist and Baptisme doe apply the death of Christ vnto vs, yet is not Baptisme superfluous, because it is of Christs institution, so is not the Masse. Againe, they apply Christs death diuersly; baptisme as the seale of our regeneration; the Eucharist as a signe of our redemption; the one signifies our sanctification by the washing of Christs blood; the other our iustification by the sufferings of the same Christ our Sauiour; the one for our initiation into the Church; the other for our confirmation: so that neither of them are superfluous; but the sacrifice of the Masse is superfluous, because the remembrance and shewing forth of Christs death is sufficiently performed without a sacrifice. Wherefore the comparison holds not, that the Masse may as well be vsed to apply the vertue of Christs death, albeit the Eucharist doth the same, as baptisme, seeing baptisme is of Christs institution, the Masse is not; and baptisme, and the Lords Supper, though they both apply the death of Christ, yet in diuers manners, and for diuers ends.
                     But the Papists pretend the same to be the end of the Masse, which is of the Lords Supper.
                     And whereas Bellarmine sayth, the Apostle speakes of the bloody sacrifice of Christ, it is true, for he neuer once dreamed of an vnbloody sacrifice which could neuer haue any existence, in rerum natura. For if you marke the Apostles words, hee quite knockes this vnbloody sacrifice of the Papists on the head, saying, Not that he should offer himselfe often, &c. 
                        Heb. 9. 25. 26. 
                        For then must 
                              〈◊〉
                           often haue suffered. Intimating

that there can be no proper offering, or real sacrificing of Christ, but by death and suffering. Wherefore where there is no actuall death of Christ, nor reall suffering, there can be no true and proper offering; and Christ hauing but once died really, he could but once be really offered.

                        The sixteenth Argument is taken from the words of Christ, who being on the Crosse cryed out, Consummatum est, It is finished. Giue vs leaue to demand,

                        what was finished? Let one of their owne friends speake. Why, now was finished, whatsoeuer God had determined, whatsoeuer he had commanded, whatsoeuer the Law and the Prophets had foretold concerning Christ; whatsoeuer was necessary and conducible for mans saluation; the oblation was offered; the types fulfilled, the shadowes abolished, the Scriptures were verified, and the great sacrifice, [quo solo Deus placari potuit] by which onely the

                        of God was pacified, is now perfected.
                     In which words obserue, first, that whatsoeuer was necessary for mans faluation was now accomplished; what neede then haue we of Masses? Secondly, that Ferus sayes, The sacrifice of Christ was finished. How dares any man then renew it in the Masse? Thirdly, he sayes, The sacrifice of Christ on the Crosse, onely could 
                              〈◊〉
                           Gods wrath. How then comes the sacrifice of the Masse to be propitiatory?
                     
                        Bellarmine answeres, that these words, It is finished,

                        . But this answere

will not serue the turne; for the prophecies were not all fulfilled, when hee spake these words; for after this time two prophecies were fulfilled: First the not

                        breaking of abone foretold, Exod. 12. 46. Secondly, the pearcing of him with a speare, prophecied Zach. 12. 10.
                     But let vs admit for good Ferus his wordes, Quoniam fuit in opere consummationis, ideo dixit consummatum est, because they were in the act of consummation, or ready to be consummated, therefore he sayd, It is finished. And let vs admit for good the first part of Bellarmines answere, that the prophecies were fulfilled; yet let vs a little pause before we grant the second.
                     For whereas he sayes, All things necessary to mans saluation, were not finished; it is true if hee meane some speciall actes 
                           〈◊〉
                        did concerne Christs person, as his resurrection, and assension, without which our redemption could not bee perfectly consummated. Againe, if he vnderstand it of some indiuiduall actions of religion, which were to be performed for the saluation of such particular persons as should beleeue afterward, it is true, they were not finished, because the persons whom God had appointed, and decreed to vse as meanes for the conuersion of others, were to liue in future ages, and had not as yet beeing, and consequently could not at that time finish those acts, whereunto they were destined of God; but if he vnderstand by these words, [All things necessary for mans saluation, are not finished] all the specificall acts of religion, as Prayer, Preaching, Administration of the Sacraments, &c.

and whatsoeuer of that kind which is necessary to mans saluation is not finished; this is false, for that they had their institution from Christ before his death, and so in the species they were finished. Or if thereby the sacrifice of Christ was not finished; this is false; for both it, and the saluation of man by it was finished; as appeares by the Apostles vsing the same words, saying, With one offering, teteleioken, consummauit, he hath consummated for euer such as are sanctified. 
                        Heb. 16. 14. And whereas he sayes that if all things necessary for mans saluation were consummated, then the sacraments and all doctrine should bee superfluous; this is false for the institution of them might be consummated, although the exercise of them in future ages were not finished.
                     Againe, the perfection of Christs sacrifice abolisheth not the vse of doctrine and Sacraments, which doe represent vnto vs the death and sacrifice of Christ, but it abolisheth all other sacrifices of Propitiation; for if they be but memorialls of Christs death they are superfluous; the word and sacraments beeing sufficient to that end; and if they be more then memorials, as auaileable to forgiue sinnes, they are blasphemous, and make Christs sacrifice imperfect.
                  
                  
                     
                        Argument. 17.
                     The seauenteenth argument is taken from the falshood of the Canon of the Masse, and it is thus framed. Such as is the Canon, such is the sacrifice. But the Canon of the Masse is false.
                     
                        Ergo, the sacrifice is false, and consequently not Propitiatory.

The falshood of the Masse appeares in diuers things.
                     1. In the ancient Church when the Lords Supper was celebrated, the Christians vsed to bring their agapai, which were the bread and wine for the reliefe of the poore, and the maintenance of the Ministry; and when they had laide downe these oblations (which were neuer accounted a Propitiatory sacrifice) they prayed for the prosperity and preseruation of the Church: which in the Canon before the consecration is applyed vnto the bread and wine, and the bread and wine is offered vnto God the Father for the happinesse of the Church.
                     Secondly, in the Canon, They pray vnto God that he would accept that pure sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ, as he accepted the sacrifices of Abell and Melchizedech. In which words they become intercessours vnto God the Father to accept his Son Iesus Christ, as though he were not worthy to be accepted of himselfe. And how absurd is it to compare the most pretious sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ (if it were so really and truely) vnto the sacrifice of Abel, which was but a lambe or a goate.
                     And how vnwisely doe they pray that God would accept the sacrifice of his Sonne as hee did accept the sacrifice of Melchizedech, whereas it cannot appeare (as is formerly prooued) by the holy scripture, that Melchizedech offered bread and wine; how absurd is it then to compare the sacrifice of Christ with that sacrifice which neither was, is, nor shall be?
                     Thirdly, the Canon saith, that the Priest offereth vnto God the heauenly Father the bread of life. But where are they commanded to offer the bread of life,

seeing in the scripture there is mention made of eating the bread of life, but not of offering?
                     Fourthly, the Canon ouerthrowes the article of ascension; for it commands the Angells to carry that vnspotted sacrifice to the high Altar of heauen, and to present it before God the Father. What? Is not Christ ascended, and fitteth for euer at the right hand of God? and hath he now more need of the helpe of Anglls then when he first ascended by the whole power of his Godhead? and cannot hee appeare before his Father, but by the assistants of Angells?
                     But let me bee bold to demand three questions of our aduersaries grounded vpon these words of the Canon, Supplices te rogamus omnipotens Deus, iube haec perferri per manus sancti Angeli, &c. We humbly beseech thee, O Omnipotent God; that tbou wouldest command 
                        Heb. 10. 12. 
                        this sacrifice to be carryed by the hands of the holy Angell, vnto thy high Altar in the sight of thy diuine Maiesty, &c.
                     First, if they vnderstand it of the bread and wine transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ, how comes it to passe, that they are not taken by the Angell, and carryed immediately into heauen according to the prayer of the Church?
                     Secondly, I demand, if their doctrine bee true of their Multipresence, that the true humane body and blood of Christ be both in heauen, and in many thousand places vpon the earth at one time, what need then the Angell to carry the body of Christ into heauen, where it is already before his heauenly Father?
                     Thirdly, (if it be so as they say, that Christ in the night when he instituted the Lords Supper, did offer

himselfe, his naturall body and blood vnder the forms of bread and wine, a true Propitiatory sacrifice to his heauenly Father) I demand whether the Angell did carry this sacrifice into heauen, or whether it did 
                           〈◊〉
                        before his Father in heauen, or no? If they say no; how then was the sacrifice accepted? or how comes the Church to pray for that priuiledge, of hauing this sacrifice carryed into heauen, which was not vouchsafed to the sacrifice offered immediately by Christ himselfe? If they affirme that it was carryed into heauen, it would then follow, that Christs body was in heauen before his passion, resurrection, or ascension; and when he in his humane nature ascended into heauen from his Disciples, hee found his humane body and blood before his Father, and to haue beene there before it came thither.
                     Thus they make Christ to haue two bodies, and consequently two soules; and so Christ is not one, but two; but many; but innumerable. These absurdities doe directly result, and arise from their blasphemous Canon; which is so grosse and palpable, as deserues to be hissed out of the Church.
                     Lastly, the Canon in diuers places ouerturnes the Mediation of Christ, in that they pray to Saints and Angells making them to be intercessours; it also establishes Purgatory and prayer for the dead, doctrines so dissonant from the truth of the Scriptures, as when we see them authorized in the Church of Rome, wee may iustly call in question the vertue of their massing sacrifice.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Argument. 18.
                     The eighteenth Argument is taken from the effect of the Masse; thus. That which destroyeth the true nature of the Lords Supper cannot be a true Propitiatory sacrifice for the 
                           〈◊〉
                        of the quicke and the dead. But the pretended sacrifice of the Masse doth subuert and destroy the nature of the Lords Supper.
                     
                        Ergo, the pretended sacrifice of the Masse is not Propitiatory for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead.
                     The Maior is not denyed by our aduersaries.
                     The Minor is thus prooued. Augustine saith, Sacramentum est visibile signum inuisibilis gratiae; a visible signe of inuisible grace; so that in euery sacrament there is signum & signatum, the signe and the thing signified, both which abide whole and intire, in such sort as it is not possible that the one can be the other, or any part of the other. But the sacrifice of the Masse destroyeth the nature of a sacrament, for it taketh away the substance of the bread, which is the signe and seale of his body; it taketh away the substance of the wine, which is the symbole of his blood; and that by 
                           〈◊〉
                        and altering them, as some of them hold, or els by annihilating them, as others say; or by reducing them into their first matter; from substances into accidents, contrary vnto all nature, yea contrary to the things signified; for there ought to be resemblance betweene the signe and the thing signified; as Manna did represent the bread of life which came downe from heauen; in baptisme, water which washeth

away corporall spottes, the blood of Christ which cleanseth our spirituall pollutions; bread and wine which nourish our naturall life, the body and blood of Christ, which sustaine and feede vs vnto eternall life. But roundnesse, whitenesse, moistnesse, and rednesse, which they giue vs for signes, what analogy or proportion haue they with our spirituall nourishment? These accidents of bread and wine haue no power or vertue to feede the body, but the substance of bread and wine; they leaue those, and take away this; where then is the sacrament when the signe is abolished.
                     Againe, the sacrifice of the Masse taketh away the thing signified in the Lords Supper. Whats that? It is the body and blood of Christ, yea Christ himselfe. For the very body and blood of Christ was giuen only for them which 
                              〈◊〉
                           in him and abide in him; for them (saith the Apostle) which dwell in him by faith; and in whose hearts he dwelleth: for them (saith Saint Augustine) which are his members; and therefore the same Father saith a man may eate panem Domini, the bread of the Lord; and yet not eate panem Dominum, the Lord the bread; making a difference betweene the bread in the sacrament, and that life-giuing bread which is Christ himselfe represented by the symboles in the Eucharist. But oh what iniury is offered by the Papists in their sacrifice vnto the body and blood of Christ, which is the food of eternall life, when dogs and swine, that is reprobates and hypocrites shall bee made pertakers of it; nay, and these ex opere operato, by vertue of the very act of receiuing doe merit remission of sinnes and relaxation of punishment; nay a

Mouse, or a Dog may eate the precious body of our Lord Iesus Christ (which doth so 
                           〈◊〉
                        their greatest Doctors, that if it be demanded; Whether if a Dog or a Mouse doe eate the 
                              〈◊〉
                           Host, they doe 
                              〈◊〉
                           the very body of Christ? they are at a non plus, and know not what to answer).
                     Wee affirme and dare iustifie; That the signe of the Sacrament may be receiued of all that are of competent age in the Church; But, Res Sacramenti, the thing signified in the Sacrament, can onely be receiued by the faithfull, which are rightly of the Church: for, so saith Origen; Of this true and verie meate of this 
                        Orig. in Mat. cap. 11.
                         
                        Word made flesh, no wicked or vngodly man can eate, because it is the Word and Bread of life; because hee that eateth of this bread liueth for euer. And S. Augustine speakes plainely to this purpose, saying; The Signes are 
                        Aug. tract. 26. in Iohan. & De 
                              〈◊〉

                        common to the good and 
                              〈◊〉
                           , but the thing proper to the faithfull alone: therefore the Apostles did eate, Panem Dominum, The bread which was the Lord; but Iudas onely, Panem Domini, the Bread of the Lord, against the Lord. Doth not this take away Christ himselfe, when the Church shall giue vnto wicked men, and vnbeleeuers, and they themselues shall receiue the very substantiall Body of Christ.
                     
                     Againe, they destroy the humanity of Christ, for the which, the Fathers of the Church haue so mightily contended against diuers Heretikes: for, when without warrant of Gods word, they ascribe vnto this body, a property of being in a thousand places at once, how do they not destroy the nature of a true Humane body, which can be but in one place at one time? as is prooued, Pag. 198. Nay, doth not this Sacrifice

make Christ a dead Christ, in that they doe really separate his body from his blood, making them in consecration, and after consecration, to subsist apart; which separation was the very death of Christ?
                     And whereas Christ saith; I am with you vnto the end of the world. And; Where two or three are gathered together in my name, I will be in the middest of them. These and the like speeches, are to be vnderstood of the Diuinitie of Christ, which filleth all places: as these Speeches; You shall not have me alwaies with you; It is expedient for you, that I goe away. The heauens must containe him, vntill the restauration of all things, are to be vnderstood of his Humanity, which is circumscriptiuely, onely in one place at once. And so the Fathers vnderstand these places. Origen saith; Orig. in Mat. Tract. 33.
                         
                        It is not the man which is euery where; Where two or three be gathered together in his name; Or, yet is alwaies with vs vntill the end of the world; Or, which is in euery place where the faithfull are assembled; but, it is the Diuine power which is in Iesus. And so Saint Augustine; 
                        Aug. in 
                              〈◊〉

                              〈◊◊〉
                           ; You shall not haue me alwaies. The Church enioyed him but a few daies, in respect of his bodily presence; but, now it possesseth him by faith, and seeth him no more with these bodily eies, &c. And in another place, vpon

                        was euery where. By which words of S. Augustine it appeares, that hee conceiued the Humane body of Christ to reside in one place, and not to bee in many places at once. And in another of his writings hee De verb. Dom. Ser. 60 & de

                         hath these words; [It is expedient for you that I goe.] Although that hee be alwaies with vs by his Diuinitie: but, if he had not gone away from vs corporally, we should haue seen him daily with these carnall eies, and should neuer haue beleeued in him spiritually, &c. And for this cause he hath absented himself in body frō al the Church, to the end, that faith may be edified and builded vp.
                     
                     And to this purpose, S. Cyrill. It is meete, that all the faithfull beleeue, that howsoeuer our Lord be absent 
                        Cyr. Alex. in Ioh. l. 9. c. 21. & l. 10 c. 39.
                         
                        in body, yet he is present by his power to all them that loue him, &c. And reciprocally, no man doubteth, seeing hee ascended into heauen, that hee is absent in the flesh, though present in the spirit. What is it then? I will not leaue you comfortlesse; that is, how that after he is ascended 
                        Lib. de incarn. c. 21.
                         
                        into heauen, he is in vs by his Spirit. And againe; He is absent according to his Humanity; but, present according to his Diuinitie. Vigilius, Bishop of Trent, dissenteth not from the former, saying; The Sonne of 
                        Vigil. l. 1. cont.

                           ; but, he had not any, if you consider the nature of his Diuinitie; in regard of that, he is a creature, but in regard of this the Creator: in respect of that, hee is a subiect to be contained in one place; but, in respect of this it is not possible for him to be contained in any place. And this is the Catholike faith, & confession, which the Apostles haue deliuered vnto vs, &c. Beda saith; Christ ascending vp into heauen, after the resurrection, left his

                        Maiesty did neuer leaue them. I will conclude these testimonies with the saying of Bernard; I goe from you, saith the Lord, according to my humanitie; but, I doe not

                     But, it may be said, that the body of Christ, being now a glorified body, may bee in diuers places at once. No, so long as the humanity of Christ continues to bee a Creature, so long is it limited to one place. Theodoret speakes to this purpose; It is glorified with diuine grace, adored of the celestiall powres; but notwithstanding, a body, subiect to that limitation that it was before. And Augustine saith; The Lord is 
                        Aug. de diuer. quaest. q. 83.
                         
                        on high, but the Lord which is verity and truth (that is to say, in as much as he is God) is here also: it must needs be, that the bodie wherein he rose againe, should continue in one place, albeit, that his truth be dispersed abroad euerie where. With whom doth consent Gregory Nazianzen; We teach the same Christ, consisting of a circumscriptible 
                        Greg. Nazian. ad Theod, dial.

                        bodie, and of an incircumscriptible spirit: of a body which may be contained in a place; and a spirit which no place is able to containe. Now, against such a cloud of witnesses, with one consent agreeing, that the body of Christ is finite, and so limited to one place, and cannot be in many places at once, doth the Church of Rome contest, to maintaine this their Sacrifice, like the Vbiquitaries in ancient times, who would haue the body of Christ to fill all places.
                     But, they obiect, That Christ is God, and therefore Obiection. omnipotent, and consequently can do all things; Why then, can he not make his body to exist in many places at once? I answer; A posse ad velle non valet

And yet, I thinke, I may bee bold to say, that Christ as God, cannot doe all things, not that this implies any weakenesse in Christ; for, not to be able to doe some things, argues his perfection; as, Christ cannot lye, cannot deceiue, cannot sinne; for, so saies S. Augustine;

                           , because they cannot be accounted of as possible things; as, he cannot make an 
                              〈◊〉
                           man; nor, a Triangle without three angles, & their lines. For, this is to make a thing, to be, and not to be. Neither can he (as I suppose) make a naturall body without quantitie, or quantitie without dimensions; or, that which hath dimension, to be in diuers places at once, and yet to remaine entire in both places; for, that were ro make a contradiction true, that the whole body of Christ should be here, and the whole body of Christ should not be here.
                     Wherefore, when the Papists ascribe vnto the body of Christ, multipresence; or, vertue to be in a thousand places at one instant, what is this, but to suppose an impossibility, and to take from the natural properties of a true humane body: and thus, as they destroy the signe in the Sacrament, so by their sacrifice doe they subuert the very substance of the thing signified.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Argument. 19.
                     The last Argument is taken from the vncertainty of this Sacrifice, and is thus framed; That which is a true propitiatory Sacrifice for sinne, giues assurance vnto him for whom it is offered, of remission of his sinne. But, the Sacrifice of the Masse giues not aslurance of remission of sinne:
                     
                        Ergo, The Sacrifice of the Masse, is not propitiatory.
                     The Minor is thus proued; That which dependeth not vpon the institution of the Sacrament, nor vpon the sacramentall words (as the Papists terme them,) but, vpon the intention of the Priest, can giue no assurance of remission: For, if the Priest intend not with his minde, albeit he speaketh the words with his mouth, yet (according to their owne doctrine) he consecrateth not, and so the body of Christ is not really in the Sacrament, and consequently, it cannot be a proper Sacrifice.
                     And thus they tye the grace of God, not to his institution, accompanied with his holy Spirit; but, to the intention of the consecrating Priest; and the Son of God shall not be ours, that is, the life which is in him shall not distribute it selfe vnto the faithfull, further then the discretion of this intention shal extend. And it shall be in the power of the Priest to frustrate and send away empty, a whole Assembly of Christians, gathered together with desire to receiue saluation by this Sacrifice. Yea, howsoeuer the people are apt to depart without any benefit to their soules, for, if

the intention of the Priest be not to consecrate, or that in the act of consecration his minde bee otherwise busied in thinking of other matters, then the body of Christ are not vnder the formes of Bread and Wine; neither is it a reall Sacrifice. And neuerthelesse, if he doe consecrate, yet the people do not communicate therein, because they are not assured of the Priests intention, and therefore cannot be assuied of the Reall presence of the body of Christ. Now, where there is not assurance in the communicating, there can be no comfortable, or sauing receiuing, Rom. 14. 23. but rather sinfull, for so S. Paul saies; Whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sin. And they themseluer are of iudgment that he receiues not the body of Christ, who doth not beleeue that he receiues it: like Magick charms, wherin strong imagination and beleese workes the effect.
                     And yet obserue here, how contrary againe they are vnto themselues, when they teach; that, Opus operatum, The worke wrought, is sufficient to merit. What difference then is between the godly and the wicked? Or, what priuiledge hath the righteous more then the prophane? seeing both good and bad receiue the same consecrated Christ; performe the same worke of communicating? And for all men (that can pay well) without difference is the Sacrifice of the Masse offered.
                     Or, what comfort can the Laity of the Roman Church find in the Sacrament, when that which shold giue life to their faith, breedeth in them nothing but doubting, and vncertainty? seeing, that after they haue prepared themselues, they know not what they receiue, because they are not assured of the intention

of the consecration.
                     But here I demand of the Romanists; If the consecration of the body and blood of Christ depend vpon the intention of the Priest, so that if he intend not in the act of consecration, the Body of Christ is not then present, neither is the Bread or Wine transubstantiated. How then can the Doctors of the Church of Rome free the people from the sinne of Idolatry, which worship the creature in stead of the Creator, the vnconsecrated Elements, in stead of the true and substantiall Body and Blood of Christ? For, they worship the bread, supposing it to be the Body of Christ, when, through either the negligence, or wilfulnesse of the Priest, in not intending consecration, it remaines in its owne proper substance.
                     They thinke to falue this sore with a nice distinction, they tell vs it is materiall Idolatry, but not formall; as though Idolatry, masked vnder a couert, were not a sinne: and, because it is not voluntarie, or intentionall, therefore it were tollerable.
                     The Idolatry of Israel was neuer so grosse, as to worship any grauen Images in stead of God; but (as our Papists plead) to worship God, in or through their Images: yet, this prouoked God vnto iealousie, and drew downe his vengeance vpon these Idolaters. Is not this more palpable Idolatry, where the Bread and Wine, which are but creatures, are worshipped with Latreia, adoration which thēselues ascribe vnto God alone? And to manifest, that they ascribe vnto this Sacrifice, the same diuine worship which they ascribe vnto God, let but the Christian Reader examine the last generall Councell, held by the Church

                        of Rome, namely, the Councell of Trent, where he shall finde this blasphemous Canon; Si quis dixerit in sancto Eucharistiae Sacramento, Christum vnigenitum

consecrate not, yet they worship the 
                           〈◊〉
                        and wine with adoration.
                     But I will not here enter into the discussion of this point, whether the Eucharist is to 
                           〈◊〉
                        with Diuine worship? Least I should too much enlarge this Treatise, which hath already transcended the limites of my intention.
                     Thus hauing sufficiently satisfied (as I hope) the indifferent and impartial Reader, concerning the propounded parts of this controuersie; as namely, that the pretended sacrifice of the Masse hath no ground in the Doctrine of the Scriptures, practise of the Apostles, or writings of the ancient Fathers: as secondly touching the originall encrease and continuance of the Masse: Thirdly, of the imbecillity and weakenesse of their obiected Arguments: Lastly, of the firme and solide grounds of our dislike and opposition. I shall in fine lay before the eyes of all men a briefe enumeration of all the impieties and blasphemies of this abhominable Idoll, and so shall conclude all with a serious disswasion, from all, or any participation in that superstitious worship.
                     The Impieties of this Sacrifice are these.
                     First, it is not onely diuers from the institution of  Christ, but quite ouerthrowes it, as appeares by these particulars. 1. First, Christ instituted a Sacrament wherein he freely offereth himselfe to be receiued of all beleeuers, by faith, and to bee eaten spiritually. They turne it into a sacrifice, which is offered vnto God the Father, not beeing distributed to the people, but deuoured by the Priest, and that 
                           〈◊〉
                        , really, and materially: So that whereas the

Church should haue beene thankefull for that God hath giuen his onely sonne for her saluation, shee striues to make God her debter by offering vnto him a sacrifice; but such a sacrifice as he neuer desired, expected or commanded. 2. Christ in the Sacrament consecrated bread, and wine, which remained as signes, and symboles of the body and blood of Christ. In the Masse they consecrate the reall and substantiall body of Christ, taking away the Sacrament in that they take away the signes. 3. In the Sacrament, the vertue and efficacy is in the power of God, making it operatiue by the grace of the Spirit. In the Masse the deede done deserues pardon; and the Priest hath a portion of remission of sinnes, which may bee bestowed on whom he will. 4. The Sacrament is onely profitable for the liuing, but the Masse for the quicke and the dead. 5. The Sacrament was instituted to manifest the Communion of Saints, therefore called the Communion figured by the bread: framed of many cornes, and made into one loase, and the wine made of many grapes; so all 
                           〈◊〉
                        are one body: but in priuate Masse, the Priest consumes all the host himselfe, as though hee alone had right vnto Christ, the Layty gazing on him appearing rather to be excommunicate persons, then to haue any communion in the body of Christ, as also the Communion of Saints is abolished by the Masse, seeing any notorious sinner, who can pay for a Masse, shall haue as much relaxation of paines, as a 
                           〈◊〉
                        man. 6. In the administration of the Sacrament the Laity did pertake of the cup as well as the clergy. But in the Masse, the Sacrament is maimed by taking

away the cup from the Lay people. 7. Christ instituted, the Sacrament in remembrance of himselfe, saying, Doe this in remembrance of me. The Priest sayes Masse in remembrance of the dead. Againe, hereby they destroy the remembrance of Christs death. For as a Testament doth suppose the death of the Testator, so the alteration of that Testament supposeth that the Testator is not yet dead: wherefore the Masse beeing so much altered from the institution of Christ, which hee bequeathed as a Testament vnto his Church, doth by consequence deny the death of Christ: For it beeing sufficiently proued to be another pretended Testament, differing from the first institution, doth 
                           〈◊〉
                        require againe, that Christ should dye, recrucisying the Sonne of God; for as Paul sayth, Where a Testament is, there must necessarily follow the death of the Testator. Moreouer if Christ be offered 
                           〈◊〉
                        day how is this not rather to institute a new sacrifice, then to Doe it in remembrance of his great sacrifice vppon the Crosse. 8. Christ instituted the Sacrament, to be reuerently distributed vnto the people. But the Masse is reserued in the Pix, is carried about the Cities and Townes like a may-game. 9. Christ gaue bread and wine to his Disciples. The Priest 
                           〈◊〉
                        God vnto the people, hee being the maker of his Maker, and they eating God with their bodyly mouthes, to Christ instituted the Sacrament to confirme our Faith; they say Masse to redeeme mens soules, to cure diseases, to worke miracles.
                     The second impiety of the Masse. It commandeth  and practiseth things directly contrary to Gods

word, 
                           〈◊〉
                        inuocation of Saints, and Angels, Prayer for the dead, Adoration of creatures, Purgatory, &c.
                     Thirdly, it by consequence affirmeth that Christ 
                         is out of the fauour of his Heauenly Father, and therefore had neede of an earthly Mediator, which is the Priest, who may offer the body of Christ vnto his Father, and pray that God would accept him as the sacrifice of Abell.
                     
                     Fourthly, the Masse hindreth the seruice of God;  for God wilbe serued in spirit and truth, with an inward and entire affection; but the Masse causeth a man to rest in the outward seruice of God, as hearing, seeing, gazing, stooping, kneeling, knocking, &c. Which things of themselues are meritorious by the worke wrought; and because the Masse alone is sufficient, therefore it makes needlesse all holy exercises as Preaching, Prayer, &c. Working presumption in wicked men, who albeit they haue spent their dayes in wickednesse, yet if they haue a Masse, or can get the Priest to say Masse for them, they doubt not but to be saued.
                     Fiftly, it blasphemeth the Deity of Christ, in that  whereas God alone is to be worshipped with Diuine worship, they ascribe and yeelde that which is due vnto God alone, vnto the creature, worshipping it instead of God, as the bread and the wine in the Eucharist; and doubtlesse their Artolatreia is nothing else but Tololatreia.
                     
                     Sixtly, it derogateth from the vertue of Christs  death, making it ineffectuall, and his sacrifice imperfect, ouer-turning the Crosse of Christ, by erecting

an Altar, and reiterating that perfect and allsufficient sacrifice of Christ, which was offered once for all, whereby hee sanctified for euer, them that were perfect, hauing obtained eternall redemption for vs. And as the reiteration of the Leuiticall sacrifices argued the imperfection of them, so the repetition of the Masse argues an insufficiency in the sacrifice of Christ.
                     Seuenthly, it falsifies the word of Christ. We vsually  obserue the last speeches of dying men, as oracles, but Christ dying vpon the Crosse, shut vp all with this speech, It is finished, that is, Mans saluation is finished by this my sacrifice. And yet the Massedenies it: What is this but to make Christ a lyer?
                     Eightly, it denies the Article of Christs humanity,  in that it a scribes not vnto him those properties which are competent to all 
                           〈◊〉
                        bodies, and without which a reall body cannot subsist, as to be locally in one place at once, to be circumscriptible, to haue true demensions, &c.
                     Ninthly, it 
                           〈◊〉
                        the article of Christs session, at  the right hand of God: Who enioying a true materiall body, if hee be present in the Masse, cannot sit as a man at the right hand of his Father for euer.
                     Tenthly, it is the ground of all diffidence and distruct,  the Sacrament encreaseth our faith, while thereby wee apprehend Christ bodily absent to bee spiritually present: but the Masse depending on the intention of the Priest cannot but beget distrust in the minds of the people.
                     Eleuenthly, the Masse robbes vs of the fruite of  
                        Christs death, for the fruite of Christs death is remission

of sinnes, which is sealed vnto vs in the Lords Supper. But the Masse (by the consent of some of their greatest Doctors) is not auaileable for the remission of sinnes.
                     Twelfely, it opens the mouth of the Common  Aduersary, who despises both the persons and religions of all Christians, because the Church of Rome worshippeth a breaden God.
                     The thirteenth impiety of the Masse is this, it destroyeth  the eternity of Christs Priest-hood, who was consecrated of his father a Priest not for a time, but for euer, after the order of Melchizedech, which order was not temporall, as the Priest-hood of Rome, but eternall, not externall and visible after his assension, but spirituall and inuisible, such as could neither be supplyed by substitutes or successours. But by offering the sacrifice of the Masse, they make themselues after the order of Melchizedech, which order at the end of the world shall cease: what then shall become of Christs eternall Priest-hood?
                     The fourteenth impiety of the Masse. It maketh  the Priest of more desert then Christ himselfe. For the sacrifice is not accepted for it selfe, but for the worthinesse of the person offering. Caines sacrifice was as good as Abels, when yet it was reiected for the wickednesse of him that offered, Abels being accepted for the worthinesse of the sacrificer, so the humane nature of Christ being our sacrifice, was meritorious by the vertue of the God-head, whereby it was offered vnto his Father. But if the Priests do offer the body of Christ vnto his Father, he must needes be of more desert then the sacrifice it selfe.
                     
                        
The fifteenth impiety of the Masse. It ouerthroweth  the Doctrine of grace and iustification, which teacheth that in this life alone man hath time to worke his saluation, and to procure the fauour of God, and pardon for sinne. But the Masse is profitable for the dead, yea both to mitigate the paines, and totally to liberate out of Purgatory.
                     The sixteenth impiety of the Masse is. It subuerteth  Gods decree of Reprobation, for it is auaileable for whomsoeuer the Priest shall offer it, both for remission of sinne and liberation from punishment; who doubts not but then many a Reprobate for whom Masse is sayd, is 
                           〈◊〉
                        from eternall damnation?
                     The seauenteenth impiety of the Masse is. It robs  God of his right; for whereas it is a prerogatiue royall belonging to the Regall Crowne of Heauen, to institute Sacraments and Sacrifices, the Church of Rome hath vsurped that power, instituting this sacrifice which God neuer commanded them, neither came it into his minde; but they like Antiochus Ephiphanes, haue exalted their Idoll vpon the Lords Table: what audacious boldnesse was this in any man, to inuent without Gods command, a sacrifice to appease and pacifie the wrath of God? And what is it but an Ethelothrescta, a 
                           〈◊〉
                        diuised of their owne carnall and corrupt wils and affections?
                     The eighteenth impiety in the Masse. It establisheth  the doctrine of merit, and ouerthroweth the satisfaction of Christ; for if a man may merit by the sacrifice of the Masse, what iniustice was it in God to lay the burthen of mans wickednesse vpon Christ,
                        
causing him to satisfie by death, when men may merit by hearing or saying Masse, by offering or receiuing this sacrifice.
                     The nineteenth impiety is. Their Iesuite Salmeron 
                         is permitted to write, That the oblation of Christ 
                        Salmeron.

                        in his last Supper (which the Romanists hold to be satisfactory and Propitiatory) receiued no efficacy or vertue from the sacrifice vpon the crosse. Which all Orthodoxe Christians cannot but iudge to bee an impious Paradox. Seeing both the Sacrament of Baptisme and of the Eucharist, haue their foundation in, and vertue, and operation, from the great and allsufficient sacrifice of Christ offered vpon the crosse.
                     The twentieth impiety is in the manner of celebrating  this sacrifice. In that it is performed in an vnknowne tongue, directly contrary to the Apostolicall iniunction of Saint Paul, who willeth euery man that prayeth to pray in that language, which the common 1 Cor. 14. 14. 15, 16. people vnderstand, that the Church may be edified.
                     Secondly, in regard of the gesture of the Priest, which is so changeable, so ridiculous, so affected, more like a Player then a Sacrificer; for the Priest varieth and changeth his gesture, at least fourty or fifty times during the time of the Masse.
                     First, he boweth his body, then he rayseth himselfe and kisseth the Altar on the right side: he boweth againe, and looketh toward the host, hee ioyneth his hands, wipeth his 
                           〈◊〉
                        , listeth vp the host: then he listeth vp his eyes and boweth himselfe, and lifteth vp his eyes againe: hee boweth againe and lifteth vp the hoast aboue his forehead, vncouereth the Chalice, and holdeth it betweene his hands, keeping his thumb

and forefinger together: then hee boweth and lifteth vp the cup a little, then to his breast, or aboue his head, he setteth it downe againe, wipeth his fingers: then he spreades his armes a crosse; he boweth his body; then rising kisseth the Altar on the right side, after this he smiteth his breast: then hee vncouereth the Chalice againe, and maketh fiue crosses with the host, beyond the Chalice, on each side, vnder it and before it: then he layeth his hands vpon the Altar: the Deacon then reacheth the Priest the Paten; which he putteth to his right eye, then to his left, and maketh a crosse beyond his head with it, kisseth it, and layeth it downe; then hee breaketh the host in three parts, holding two pieces in his left hand; the other part in his right hand ouer the Chalice, which with a crosse, he letteth fall into it; the Priest then kisseth the Corporas: the Deacon taketh the Pax from the Priest, giueth it to the subdeacon, and he to the Queere; then humbling himselfe, he first taketh the body, then the blood; so hee goeth to the right horne of the Altar; then the Subdeacon powreth in wine, and the Priest rinseth the cup, and washeth his hands; hee turneth himselfe to the people, commeth againe to the Altar, and turneth to the people the second time: then bowing his body and closing his hands he prayeth to himselfe: he riseth againe, making the signe of the crosse, and bowing againe, so goeth to the Altar: insomuch that

                        Roscius-like hee seemes rather an Actor then a priest: the Masse it selfe beeing stuffed full of ceremonies borrowed from the sacrifices of both Iewes and gentiles, as Innocent the third, and Baronius themselues confesse.
                     
                        
The one and twentieth impiety, That the onely accidents  of bread and wine can nourish the body, without their proper substance.
                     The two and twentieth impiety. That the body  and blood of Christ may be made poysenous, for Bernar 
                        Platiu. darite Victor.

                        dus de monte Politiano de Domcastro, a Monk of the Iacobines order, poysoned with the Host Henry the seauenth Emperour of Germany; and Victor, Pope of Rome was poysoned with the wine he tooke in the Masse.
                     The three and twentieth impiety. That the body  and blood of Christ doe subsist apart separated one from another, both in the act of consecration and afterward.
                     The foure and twentieth impiety. That Christ is  now in the Eucharist, not a liuing but a dead Christ, in regard that albeit (as they affirme) the bread bee changed into his body, and the wine into his blood, yet neither of these (according to their owne tenent) can be transubstantiated into his soule, which is a spirituall and an immateriall substance; how then shall his soule be vnited to his body, seeing when by these words, This is my body, hee changed the elements into his body and blood, yet hee makes no mention of his soule? Wherefore the body subsisting without a soule must be but inanimate, a dead corps.
                     The twenty fiue impiety. Christ had two bodies,  one visible wherewith hee sate at Table, another inuisible, which he distributed to his Disciples vnder the formes of consecrated bread and wine.
                     The sixe and twentieth impiety. They say Christ  at his last Supper gaue his naturall body to be eaten

of his Disciples; but by their doctrine would follow, that Christ gaue his mortall body, as it was before his passion vnto his Disciples; but vnto his Church hee giues now his glorified body, such as it is sitting at the right hand of God.
                     The seauen and twentieth impietie. That the body  of Christ doth daily ascend into heauen, and descend from heauen, as Iaecobs Angells, and is contained in the hands of the Priest, is crashed in his teeth, his bones being broken.
                     The eight and twentieth impiety. That the body  of Christ being kept a long time in any vessell, will corrupt and putrifie, and wormes will bee generated of it; as Alphonsus Magnus the king of Aragon found by experience.
                     The twenty nine impiety. That Christ Iesus the  Sonne of God was not incarnate for vs, suffered not, dyed not, rose not againe, ascended not 
                           〈◊〉
                        heauen for vs, but onely bread and wine did all these things in our behalfe.
                     Or which is the last impiety. The body of Christ  was not of the seed of Dauid, sed exsemine triticeo, of the seed of wheat, was sowed in the earth, grinded in the mill, baked in the ouen, and at last torne a peeces with mens teeth.
                     Thus haue I laid open vnto thee (Christian Reader) a iust suruay and tryall of the sacrifice of the

                        Masse, which (I doubt not) appeares to thee, as it is in it owne nature, a Masse of impiety, and that Mystery of iniquity foretold by Saint Paul; which albeit it pretend the greatest honour and worship to Christ of any Ecclesiasticall seruice; yet is there not a greater

enemy vnto our King and Sauiour the Lord Iesus; nor a more hellish traytour vnto his crowne and dignity; wherein (if euer) The diuell hath transformed

It may well bee stiled a Craft, because it is a Mystery of iniquity, whereby the Church of Rome is swollen so bigge with deuouring the gold, treasure, and inheritance of the Laity that the guttes of it are well nigh bursten.

Take but away this one Pillar and their house will fall; and the fall of it will be great; for it will slay all the Lords of the Philistims.
                     
                     Now if any true Orthodoxe Christian, or soundmember Quest. of the Catholicke Church, demand of me whether it be lawfull for him to be present at Masse, albeit hee pretend that so hee keepes his heart to God?
                     I answere: No, for 
                           〈◊〉
                        the Masse is full of so

many impieties, and abhominable blasphemies, against the blessed person of the Sonne of God, ouerthrowiug both the Word and Sacraments of our Lord Iesus Christ, it is therefore vtterly vnlawfull for any Christian to be present, at it, or to communicate in that seruice. Argument of Ridley and Bradford.
                     
                     Secondly, we cannot be partakers of Gods religion and Antichrist seruice, whereof the Masse is a principall limbe; a man cannot bee a member of the Church of Christ, and of the Church of Rome, as it now stands. But he that frequenteth their Idolatrous assemblies makes himselfe a member thereof. And therefore cutteth himselfe off from being a member of the Church of Christ. Argument of Bradford.
                     
                     Thirdly, to dissemble and halt in matters belonging to Gods glory, is impious and vngodly; but they who are present at Masse, both hearing the name of God blasphemed, and seeing many abhominations, and yet hold their peace, do notably dissemble; Ergo, They sinne egregiously against God. Argument of Bradford.
                     
                     Fourthly, 
                           〈◊〉
                        of the Masse impugneth diuers petitions of the Lords Prayer; and so the practise of such is contrary to the dayly prayer they vse. How can we say, Thy Kingdome come, when nothing in the earth doth more destroy the Kingdome of Christ then the Masse? How can we pray, Thy will be done, when we do our owne wils, and the wils of Idolaters, flat against the will of God? How can we pray, Hallowed be thy name, when wee seeme to approoue the Masse which is nothing but blasphemy against the whole Trinity? How can wee pray, Deliuer
                        
                        vs from euill, which knowing the Masse to bee euill, doe runne into it? wherefore if wee meane as we pray, we must not pertake in the Masse, least wee approue of that in our practise which we condemne in our prayer. Argument of Bradford.
                     
                     Fiftly, whatsoeuer giues occasion to the wicked to be more obfirmed, and to the weake to stumble and fall, is to be abhorred: But Protestants going to Masse, and by their presence giuing allowance to it, do occasion the obstinate to be more intractable, the weake Papists to be more resolute, the wauering Protestant quite to fall. Bradfords Argument.
                     
                     Sixtly, Daniel refused to be filled with the Kings meates, which were polluted by Idolatry. And so Dan. 1. 8.

                        Iudeth likewise. The Maccabees manfully gaue their liues in defence of the Ceremonies of the Law. Ergo, we ought much more to endure and suffer all things for the maintenance of the pure word of God, and holy Sacraments. Bishop Ridleyes Argument.
                     
                     Seauenthly, God commanded his people Israel, by the mouth of his Prophet Amos, Not to seeke Bethel, Amos 5. 5. Heb. 10. 38. 1 Cor. 3. 17. 
                        nor to enter into Gilgall, where Idolatry was vsed. And againe, My soule hath no pleasure in those, that withdraw themselues, sayth the Lord, If any man prophane the Temple of the Lord, him will God destroy, for the Temple of God is holy, which yee are. All strange worship is counted whoredome by the Lord, and they that follow it, goe a whoring. But they that goe to Masse, enter into Bethel, and Gilgal, that is places of Idolatry, they withdraw themselues from the faith in their outward behauiour; they prophane their bodies, which are Gods Temples, being present at 
                              〈◊〉
                           seruice, they
                        
goe a whoring after a strange religion.
                     
                        Ergo; Protestants, going to Masse, disobey Gods command, procure his displeasure,, will cause God to destroy them, and diuorce themselues from God and his Church. Philpots Argument.
                     
                     Eightly, The Apostle directly forbids all participation with such as are Idolaters, in the eating of meat sacrificed to Idolls, shewing, that thereby the weake 1 Cor. 8. 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 Cor. 10. 14, 15, 16, 20, 
                              〈◊〉
                           
                         brethren are offended, and the partakers make themselues Communicants at the Table of Diuells: now a man cannot be partaker at the Lords Table, and the table of Diuells. But, the Masse is an Idolatrous seruice, a superstitious worship, and the Altar thereof is the Table of Diuells, howsoeuer it is to be hallowed with the inuocation of God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost; Angels, Apostles, Martyres, Confessors, Saints, and painted ouer with the lustre of religion, whereas it is indeed, nothing but a painted Iezabel, a deceitfull Strumpet with a false complexion.
                     Ninthly, God is the Creator both of soule and body, therefore he is to be worshipped both in soule 1 Cor. 6. 
                              〈◊〉
                           21. and body; Know 
                              〈◊〉
                           not that your body is the Temple of the holy Ghost, therefore glorifie God in your body and spirit which are Gods: whereas God hath giuen both, so hee requires the seruice of both. And Paul will not giue a tolleration to any man to dishonour Rom. 12. 1. God by his body: I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a liuing sacrifice, holy and acceptable vnto God.
                     
                     God will not be content with reseruing the soule

to him, when men bestow the worship of their bodyes vpon Idols. The soule and body make one man, and God will be worshipped in the whole entire man; he will not diuide stakes with the Masse; for, as he requireth the whole heart, which is the soule; so hee also commandeth the whole strength, which is the body. Againe, the soule cannot be in heauen, if the body be in hell; neither can he bow the knee of his soule to God, that bowes the knee of his body to the Diuell. The Arke and Dagon cannot rest vnder one roofe: 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           Sam. 5. 4. one man cannot be the temple of God and of Idols.
                     Tenthly, Christ would not fall downe and worship Mat. 4. 10. the Tempter, albeit he might haue reserued his heart to God. And in Eliah his time, God accounted none for his 
                           〈◊〉
                        , but such as had not bowed 
                        
                           
                              〈◊〉

                        the 
                              〈◊〉
                           vnto Baal: so God accounts none for his seruants that giue outward worship to the Idoll of the Masse, by bowing vnto it in token of adoration, by kissing the Pax, by creeping to the Crosse, by being sprinkled with holy water. Will a husband, finding his wife committing Adultery with another, admit this as a lawfull and reasonable excuse, that her heart was with her husband? No more will Christ allow our bodily presence at the Masse, although our hearts be not consenting to it. Bradfords Answer.
                     
                     And indeede, this is the difference betweene the Church of God, and the Synagogue of Satan, that the one is a chast wife and Spouse of Christ, & keeps her to her husband alone, and doth not admit others to the vse of her faith; the other plaies the harlot with many louers, and keepes not her faith nor worship to God alone.
                     
                        
Eleuently, if we must auoide an Hereticke, then much more an Idolater: But an Hereticke is to bee Tit. 3. 10. 11.

                         the participation in Idolatrous seruice. For, if S. Iohn would not abide vnder the roofe, nor haue any ciuill society with Cerinthus an Hereticke, how can a Christian ioyne in diuine worship with such as are Idolaters?
                     Lastly, the Apostle charges vs to avoide all appearance of euill. 1 Thes. 5. 22. But how doe Christians auoid the appearance of euill, when they associate themselues with Idolaters, partaking with them in their abhomination, and consenting to their dishonouring of God by superstitions, which in the Masse is done in a high degree: whereby it appeares euidently that it is altogether vnlawfull for an Orthodoxe Christian, a true protestant, a sound member of the Church of Christ, to be present at the Idolatrous sacrifice of the Masse, albeit with a pretence of keeping his heart to God.
                     Thus, hauing laid downe sound and solide reasons for our non conformity vnto that Idolatrous worship, neither in body nor soule. I shall thinke it expedient to take away all excuses of such as desire to hault betweene God and Baal; approouing the reformed religion of the Church of England, yet, shall either for feare, fauour, or hope of gaine, at any time be brought to ioyne with the Romanists in hearing or seeing of Masse.
                     
                        
First they plead; That albeit there be some faults Plea 1.
                         in the Masse, which may be mended; yet, if they doe not consent thereunto, what need they trouble themselues; for, S. Augustine saith; Communion in the Sacraments de fileth not a man, but consent of deeds.
                     
                     If there were but some small faults, or indifferent Answer. matters, or tollerable abuses in the Masse, rather shewing imperfection, then tending to open impiety, they might, for the common Peace sake, be somwhat borne with. But now, seeing it is stuffed full of blasphemies, and spotted with foule Idolatry, manifestly oppugning Christs sacred Gospel, and most Diuine institution of the Lords Supper; no man can therefore with good conscience giue consent thereunto. And Augustines meaning is (as appeares by the precedent and subsequent words) that the badnesse of the Minister, or wickednes of the Receiuers pollute not the Sacraments, nor such as receiue with faith and due preparation; but, with either wicked Minister, or Receiuers, to commit vngodly actions is that which defiles a man. Hee saith not, that men ought to refraine from Idolatrous worship, for feare of pollution. Bishop Ridlies answer.
                     
                     Secondly, they plead the examples of the Prophets Plea 2.
                         of Christ, of the Apostles; for, Eliah stood by when Baal's Priests offered Sacrifice: And a Prophet 1 King. 18. 
                              〈◊〉
                           King. 13. 1. came vnto the Altar, where Ieroboam was offring incense vnto the golden Calfe, which he had erected at Bethel. Christ himselfe refused not the Temple, albeit the Priests were growne very prophane, corrupt, and superstitious. And Paul also came into the Gentiles Temple, where hee saw an Altar dedicated

to the Vnknowne God. 
                        Act. 17. 13.
                     
                     By these examples they iudge themselues priuiledged to goe to Masse.
                     I answer; These examples doe not patronize such Answer. as partake in the Idolatrous Seruice of the Masse. For, first Eliah, when he stood by the Priests of Baal, it was not to partake with them, but to conuince them of their Idolatry, and to discouer vnto the people who was the true God. The Prophet that came to the Altar of Bethel, was sent of God to prophecie against it: neither did either of these Prophets communicate with these Idolaters, or vouchsafed the least reuerence vnto their Idols, or superstitious seruice. So Christ and the Apostles frequented the Temple, and ioyned with the Iewes in those lawful ceremonies which God had commanded them by the mouth of Moses; but for their hypocrisie they did openly 
                           〈◊〉
                        it, not imitating them in their superstitious traditions. And for Paul, it appeares not that he entred into the Idolls Temple, or went on purpose to behold their worship, but saw it accidentally, for so he saies; As I passed by and beheld your deuotions, I saw an Altar with this inscription; To the vnknowne God. And it is to be obserued, that Paul gaue no honour to their Idolatry, but tooke hereby a iust occasion to reueale vnto them the true God, and to preach vnto them, Iesus Christ. So, that these examples, rather make against such as goe to Masse, professing the contrary religion, seeing that 
                           〈◊◊〉

                        , condemne such Idolatry and superstition, then any way seeme to giue any approation of it. But such

Protestants as 
                           〈◊〉
                        resort to heare Masse, doe by their presence yeeld allowance and approbation of that Idolatrous seruice.
                     Thirdly, they plead, that except they goe to Masse, they loose their lands, liuings, and wealth, they are 
                           Plea 3. driuen to fly their Countrey, to forsake both fauour and society of their parents, kindred, friends, or acquaintance, and thereby themselues, their wiues and children are brought to beggery.
                     I answer in the words of our Sauiour; Hee that loueth father, or mother, or friends, houses, lands, riches, wife, or children more then Christ, is not worthy of him. And whosoeuer shall for feare of the losse of any of these, reuolt away from God and his truth, is not worthy of the name of a Christian, seeing hee appeares, rather to bee a louer of himselfe then of Christ, preferring his owne temporall profit, before spirituall gaine; the fauour of men, before the loue of God; the satisfying of friends, before the honour of his Sauiour; the enioying of an earthly habitation, before the purchasing of an earthly kingdome. Wherefore it is better to loose these, and win Christ; then to attaine these by apostacie and Idolatry, and loose Christ: Yea, What would it bene fit thee to gaine the whole world, by going to Masse, and to loose thine owne soule? But albeit, in the daies of persecution, the Martyres of Christ haue beene so violently pursued with cruelty, as that they were constrained to sacrifice 
                           〈◊〉
                        to God in the fire, because they would not forsake Christ Iesus, and ioyne with the Romish Idolaters in their blasphemous Masse; witnesse Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, Bradford, Philpot,
                        
                        Bilney, with many moe: yet (thankes be to God) in these our daies the Gospell flourisheth, the Sacraments are purely administred, according to Christs institution; and there is freedome by the lawes of the Realme, giuen to all sound Protestants, to serue God, according to the doctrine now established in the Church of England. And if it bee not lawfull for a man to go to Masse by eompulsion, but that he ought rather to suffer the spoyling of his goods, the losse of friends, or to lay downe his life for Christ and his truth, then to participate with them in their blasphemous seruice, and impious Sacrifice: Then cursed shall that man be, that being a Protestant, a professor of the true Catholike faith (howsoeuer our Aduersaries of Rome challenge the title) shall voluntarily, and without 
                           〈◊〉
                        , either for flattery, fashion, present gaine, or future hopes, or the fauour of great Personages be drawne to deny his Christ, and to cleaue vnto Antichrist, forsaking the Church of God, and becomming one of the Synagogue of Satan, forgoing Sion, for Babylon; Ierusalem, for Bethel and Samaria: refusing the waters of Siloam, which run

                           . 8. 6. softly, and cleauing vnto Resin, and Remeliahs Sonne: reiecting the Communion of Saints, in the participation of the Word and Sacraments, taught and administred in the Protestant Church, now established in England, and associating himselfe vnto the Sons of Belial, participating with them in their abhominable sacrifice of the Masse. He that shall thus doe, is much more vnworthy of Christ, then such as shall be constrained, or by feare forced to consent vnto their Idolatry; and doubtlesse shall finde such horrour in

his conscience, and feele such a hell in his soule, as that if God make him not a spectacle of shame and misery in this world, yet he shall surely doe it before men and Angells in the world to come.
                     Fourthly, they plead the example of Daniel, who, 
                           Plea 4. say they, was present, and worshipped the golden Image, which appeares by this, that hee was not cast into the Furnace, with the three Children his Companions.
                     I answer, that either Daniel was not present, which Answer. is most probable, or else he was not accused vnto the King: or if hee were accused, it may be the King would not heare his accusation, or put him to death for the great fauour and affection which he bare vnto him for the great seruice he did in his kingdome. And doubtlesse Daniel, that would rather bee a prey vnto the Lyons, then not pray vnto his God; had rather haue tryed the heat of the fiery Furnace, then haue vouchsafed so much countenance to Idolatry, as to worship the golden Image.
                     Fiftly, they plead the example of Iehu, who openly 
                           Plea 5. professed the religion of Baal, yet hee dissembled and meant nothing lesse, and the Lord commends him for his diligent Execution of that which was right

                        in his eies. Vers. 30.
                     Our answer is, Iehu is commended, not for his dissembling, Answer. but for his diligence in destroying Ahabs house, with the Priests, and religion of Baal, and all thar belonged thereunto; for, in other matters belonging to the seruice of God, he departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam, the Sonne of Nebat, that made Israel to sinne: wherefore this can be no excuse

for going to Masse, seeing God neuer approued of dissimulation.
                     Sixtly, they plead the command of the Magistrate, 
                           Plea 6. thus; Wee are commanded to obey our Magistrates though they be wicked, and therefore, if they enioyn vs to goe to Masse, we see not how we can doe otherwise for feare of contempt and disobedience.
                     We are bound indeed to obey wicked gouernours, Answer. but so long onely as they command nothing contrary to Gods word, their wickednesse cannot release vs, or giue a dispensation for disobedience, but if they command any thing contrary to Gods word; especially to partake in the Masse, a superstitious seruice, so directly blaspheming Christ and his seruice, so plainely opposing the doctrine of the Gospell, and so fundamentally euerting the institution of the Lords Supper: in this case obedience is a sinne; for, what say the Apostles of Iesus? their answer is; Whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken vnto you more then vnto God, iudge yee. And our Sauiour teacheth vs, to Giue vnto Caesar that which is Caesars, and vnto God that which is Gods. As wee performe our lawfull duties to men, so must we not for their sakes, neglect our duties to God, or doe any thing whereby he is dishonoured.
                     Seuenthly and lastly, they plead the example of Naman 
                        
                           Plea 7. the Syrian, who being conuerted to the true worship of the God of Israel, desired to bee dispenced with when he should goe with the King his Master into the house of Rimon an Idoll, and bow himselfe there, and that herein, God would be mercifull vnto
                        
                        him; vnto whom the Prophet Elisha answered; Goe in peace; as liking of his motion, and yeelding to it. 2 King. 18. 19.
                     
                     Wee answer; the opinions of Diuines, touching Answer. this thing are diuers; some thinke he spake onely of ciuill and politike presence, that his Master the King might leane vpon him before his Idoll; and not of Religious, for he makes open protestation, that hee Zanch. in Eph. 5 Perkins on the 2 Commandement.
                         would neuer worship other God then the God of Israel; to the which the Prophet condescendeth. But howsoeuer, the gesture it selfe is indifferent, to stand when the King stands, or bow when the King boweth: yet this gesture being clothed with such circumstances, seemes not to be approoued. That he should do this.
                     First, in a Temple.
                     Secondly, before an Idoll.
                     Thirdly, in the time of publike seruice.
                     Fourthly, by one professing the true God;
                     This seemes not so probable. And both those famous As appeares Zanc. l. de redemptione. And Perk. Case of Conscience, Book. 2. ch. 12. Diuines departed from this answer, cleauing vnto that which was more sound in their latter workes.
                     Others thinke, he speaketh of the time past; as if he should say; Herein, that I haue bowed iu the house of Rimmon, &c. The Lord be mercifull vnto me: vsing the future, for the time past.
                     Others (and that more truly) expound the words of Naaman thus; That Naaman professed it a sinne to goe in to bow with his Master in the house of Rimmon, and therefore prayeth twice for mercy for it, professing, he will neuer worship any but the true God:

neither doth he onely pray for sinne past, but in the sence of his owne weakenesse desireth mercy that 
                           〈◊〉
                        may not bee drawne from his purpose, and withsll stirreth vp the Prophet to pray for him that God would giue him grace and strength, and for pardon if at any time hee should against his purpose bee drawne into his former sinne: and in this sense the Prophet bids him goe in peace: as if hee should say, I will pray that God would keepe thee in thy godly resolution, and for mercy and pardon if thou shouldest be drawne aside, and so farewell.
                     
                     The words of the Prophet Elisha, Goe in peace: are Willet. 
                              〈◊〉
                           . also diuerssy expounded. Some thinke the Prophets words 
                           〈◊〉
                        no grant made vnto his petition, but rather a prohibition, not to trouble himselfe about those matters; as if he should haue sayd, Content thy selfe, require no such thing, it would trouble thy conscience, but goe in peace, keepe a good conscience, and labour 
                        Polan. Syntag. tom. 2. l. 9. c. 30.
                         
                        for the peacetherof; (& so as Polan. obserues) the words of the Prophet are, Tantum dimittentis abeuntem, non concedentis postulatum; onely a valediction, and not any concession or granting of his request.
                     Againe, it appeares not by the words of the Prophet that he gaue any tolleration or dispensation vnto Naaman: for Naaman makes in one verse two petitions; one for permission to goe into Rimmons Temple; the other for two mules load of earth to carry home with him to offer sacrifice vpon, vnto the Lord.
                     Now the Prophet makes the same answer vnto both,

and therefore doth either condescend to both or deny both: but grant them both he did not, for the one was cleane contrary to the law, to giue Naaman leaue to sacrifice in Syria who was not a Priest, whose office it was alone to offer sacrifice; and moreouer Ierusalem was the onely place appointed for that action. This request therefore the Prophet can by no meanes be thought to haue granted.
                     
                        Ergo, nor the other. And vnto this sence I doe adhere, for that the Prophet neither could nor durst giue any liberty to Naaman to be present at the Idolatrous worship of the Syrian Rimmon.
                     
                     I am not ignorant of the opinion of some that the Prophet answers dispensando, by the way of dispensation, AsPaulus Burgensis. though not generally, yet in that case, onely to goe into the Idols Temple, and to bee present at Nichbl. Lyra in locum. their Idolatry. But Lyranus will haue it declarando, by declaring it to be lawfull for Naaman to bee present in the Temple of Rimmon at Idolatrous seruice and sacrifice, so it were onely for ciuill respect vnto the king his Master; and of this opinion seemes 
                           
                              〈◊〉

Tripart. l. 6. c. 35.
                         of his Idols, and when the doore-keeper sprinkled his gowne with the Idols water, as the Pagans vsed, Valentinian forthwith gaue him a blow on the eare.
                  
                  
                     
                     Conclusion.
                     Thus hauing sufficiently refelled their strongest arguments, and giuen answer to their chiefest pleas, the conclusion shall bee this. Seeing the Romish Masse hath quite ouerthrowne, and thrust the Supper of the Lord out of the Church; (the holy Supper being an assembly, a body of the faithfull, vnited and knit together in one spirit; strengthening our faith, 
                           〈◊〉
                        our charity, kindling our zeale; wherein is celebrated the memory of the death and passion of our Lord by a plaine and open rehearsall of the cause, manner, and benefits of the same; whereby the faithfull are taught to acknowledge and call to mind the greatnesse of their sinnes, and to admire and magnifie the great and vnspeakeable mercies of God; whereby they are stirred vp to renounce and forsake themselues, to giue themselues wholy vnto God, to dye vnto their lusts, and concupiscences, and to liue vnto Christ, who hauing once deliuered himselfe to the death of the crosse for to giue them life, did yet further vouchsafe to giue himselfe to them in this sacrament, as spirituall meate and drinke to feede their soules vnto eternall life; and herein all the faithfull doe communicate together in the bread and in the cup; in the body and in the blood of our Lord, being taught thereby that they are diuers members of one mysticall hody, whereof Christ is the head; being quickned, mooued, and gouerned by one Spirit, euen the Spirit of Christ, liuing one life, and hauing their hearts vnited one to another by loue.
                     
                        
Herein wee are seriously admonished of our bond and obligation to God the Father for sending his Son, and God the Sonne fulfilling the will of his Father; the remembrance of whose death wee shew forth till he come; who (as verily as the Minister giueth vs the bread and wine to be receiued with our hands, which being eaten and drunken, are conuerted into our substances and become nourishments of our bodies) giueth vs his body and 
                           〈◊〉
                        to be receiued with faith, that we may eate and drinke them spiritually, and that they may be turned into the life and substance of our soules, making vs one with Christ, and Christ one with vs.
                     This was the holy Supper of the faithfull in the ancient Church, and this is ours; with the rest of the reformed Churches. But in the Masse there are no footsteps of the holy Supper; but all things are so changed, as if the Lords Supper were abolished, and the Masse were come in the stead therof; for in the Masse there is a Prieft in a strange garment, his face fixt vpon an Altar, with a Clarke standing behind him, muttering in a strange language, interlarded with signes, lifting vp a wafer in an affected and ceremoniall superstitious sort; causing it to be worshipped; dipping it in the wine, eating it alone, persuading the people, that by thus much as hath beene done, beeing at their request, and bought with somepiece of money, he hath sacrificed Christ for them. What shewing foorth of the Lords death is there till he come? Nay is there not an abolishing of the perfection, value and efficacy of Christs death and sacrifice? Is their not 
                           〈◊〉
                        in robbing the lay-people of the cup? Is not the Masse

ful of abhominable blasphemies and grosse impieties? Are not the deaths and sufferings of Saints and Martyrs rather reckoned vp then the death of Christ represented? Is there not rather a breach of charity then any Symbole of loue, when the Priest eates all himselfe, the common people being excluded from it? where is there any communion betweene the members, (or signification of our engrafting into Christ?) The scriptures neither authorising, nor the Primitiue and Apostolicall Church practising, nor the Fathers in the first 600. yeares acknowledging any such Propitiatory sacrifice, as the Church of Rome both offereth and adoreth; but in turbulent ages it grew from a Sacrament to a sacrifice; from a Sacrifice of prayse to a Propitiatory sacrifice by way of representation; from thence in times of ignorance, carelesnesse, and Politicall contentions to a reall and proper Propitiatory Sacrifice.
                     And seeing God our heauenly Father hath spread a table for vs in this wildernesse, while others starue for foode, let euery true Christian say with the Prodigall sonne, I will arise and goe to my Father; Let vs all Luk. 15. 18 remember that exuberant and superaboundant refreshing, which we shall receiue from the table of God our Father, where Christ himselfe is the refection and sustenance of our soules, that our soules being nourished by faith in our Mediatour and sacrifice, Christ the Lord, both soule and body may bee saued by him in the day of iudgement,
                     Oh that God would open the blind eyes of such as are ensnared with the allurements of the Romish Church, and deceiued with the false complexion of

that painted Iesabell, beeing poysoned with the cup of her fornications; that so (if they belong vnto the 
                           〈◊〉
                        of grace) they may escape out of Babylon, and be saued.
                     And for vs that haue beene borne of the Church, and brought vp in her bosome, vnto whom God hath reuealed the purity of his word, and exhibited his holy Sacraments without maime or alteration; let vs neuer disclaime our Spirituall mother, making our selues bastards by becomming the children of a Scarlet coloured Whore; let vs neuer become Apostates from the truth, staining 
                           〈◊〉
                        soules, and wounding our consciences by Idolatry.
                     If we be Iewes, that is, the Israel of God; let not vs pollute our selues with Romish Samaritans; Let vs not communicate with them in their impious Mystery or Mysticall impiety, of their Massing Sacrifice; least wee runne vpon our owne ruine and destruction.
                     But let vs abhorre it, as beeing Antichristian; let vs renounce it as most blasphemous against God, and against his Christ.
                     Let neirher prosperity, nor aduersitie, hope of profit, or feare of losse draw vs to pertake in that Idolatrous seruice, least while we seeke the world we loose our soules; and while wee feare the face of man, we bereaue our selues of the fauour of God.
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        our aduersaries perseuere in their superstition, they are blind leaders of the blind; but let euery Christian Ioshua, say couragiously, I and mine will feare, will serue, will worship the Lord of heauen and earth, and not make to my selfe As Auerroes vpbraided the Christians. a breaden god, or adore

the creature in stead of the Creator.
                     Let vs not for feare of the Popes Anathema's excommunicate our selues from the society of Gods Saints: but rather to say with vndaunted resolution in the words of Paul. We are ready not onely to be bound, but dye at Rome for the name of the Lord Iesus. And albeit these are the dayes wherein the enemies of the Gospell thinke to preuaile, yet fortifie your selues with courage in your profession, start not a fide like a broken Bow; forsake not Christ to take part with his Aduersaries, but stand for your Sauiour, as hee hath stood for you, fight for your Sauiour as hee hath fought for you, dye for your Sauiour, as he hath dyed for you, that you may receiue the reward of immortality with the rest of the holy Saints and Martyrs in the kingdome of heauen for the infinite merit of our eternall Priest, and Al-sufficient Sacrifice Iesus Christ the righteous. To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost, three distinct persons, but one glorious and euerliuing God be ascribed Honour, Maiestie, Power and Dominion for euer.
