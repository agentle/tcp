               To the Chriſtian Reader.
            HEre haſt thou (gentle Reader) the making of holy water, and ſuche other of theyr ſuperſticious trumpery, faythfully trāſlated into thy mother tong, whereby thou maieſt ſee, what a derogacion it is againſt our onlye Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. They haue, & do yet make me beleue, that they do it in remēbraūce of the ſhedding of Chriſtes bloude, but when they make it vpon Sondaies, then they can ſay, they make it to dryue Deuils away. If this be not blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, & hys precious blud, I know not what is blaſphemy. They ſay to Salt, I

                (Chriſten Reader) that they be ſo loth that theyr ſeruice ſhuld be in Engliſh, for whoſe hart would not melt (if he had ani ſparke of knowledge in gods truth) to heare ſuch charming againſt God and his truth. For god hath cō
               maunded, whatſoeuer he biddeth vs do, that obſerue and do, and not oute own imaginations, contrarye to hys

For if ye may make at your pleaſure ſuch chinges to driue diuels away, & to heale both body and ſoule, what neede haue ye of Chriſt, of hys death, of hys reſurrection, in whyche conſiſt our whole ſaluation.
