               And the one deſir'd the other,
               along with him to goe:
               The other denayd, and to him ſaid,
               
                  I would you had not ſaid ſo.
               
            
            
               Beeing demaunded why,
               that he that wiſh deſir'd?
               Why ſir quoth he my reaſon is,
               becauſe I am almoſt tyr'd?
               And are you tyr'd quoth he,

               Then truely ſince with all my hart,

               But ſeeing you are weary,
               now let vs take repoſe:
               Heere let vs ſit and reſt vs,
               and to you Ile diſcloſe:
               Some Vices in the Country,

               If youle attend good Sir quoth hee,

               from whence I came are more:
               More hatefull vices, name you one,
               Ile name you halfe a ſcore:
               Iſt posſible (quoth he)
               the Citty ſo ſhould flow?
               With Vice in ſuch abundance,
               
                  I would you had not ſaid ſo.
               
            
            
               But now ſir for the Country,
               becauſe I muſt begin?
               Ile firſt ſpeake of the Mizer,
               that lump, that heape of ſinne:
               This vrchin is a Farmer,
               whom many men doe know:
               He ſcrapes and hoards the Diuell and all
               
                  I would you had not ſaid ſo.
               
            
            
               Though Barnes and Racks be full,
               though Chiſts be cram'd with Coine:
               And though he nothing wanteth,
               yet muſt he needs purloyne:
               His Tennants Rents heele raiſe,
               his Neighbors heele vndoe:
               By remouing of their Land markes,
               
                  I would you had not ſaid ſo.
               
            
            
               And if a Neighbour hath,
               neere him a pee
                     •
                   of ground:
               Heele neuer leaue by right nor wrong,
               till it to him be bound:
               If true meanes cannot get it,
               he then to Law will goe:
               And wrong a poore man for his owne,
               
                  I would you had not ſaid ſo.

               To the ſame Tune.
               
                  THere are ſome in our Parriſh,
                  that too much are to blame:

                  they to the Church ere came:
                  But doth the Alehouſe haunt,
                  and ſo themſelues vndoe:
                  O Lord ſure quoth the other againe,

                  of truths a number more:
                  Which ſhame makes me conceale,
                  but yet I greeue therefore:
                  For many doe offend,
