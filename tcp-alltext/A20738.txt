                     Homer ſhevveth, that God throvveth his ſhielde in the vvarre, to defende the Prince from harme, and that he appoynteth to euerye gouernour, a peculiar God for his protection.
                  Hovv God plagueth them that conſpire againſte theyr Prince, this Hiſtorie declareth at the full. For of all them, that coniured againſt Caius Caeſar, not one did eſcape violent death. The vvhich this Author hathe a pleaſure to declare, bycauſe he vvould affray all men from diſloyaltie tovvard their Soueraigne.
                  The greateſt ſeruice that men can doe, is to ſaue theyr Countrey from daunger. The Romanes gaue him a crovvne that ſaued one Citizen. Then hovv many crovvnes deſerueth he, that helpeth to ſaue a number?

                  Then ſeeyng this Authoures onely purpoſe is, to extoll the princely rule, and to procure the ſafetie of the people, I haue preſumed to make a preſente of hym to youre Honoure, that you being in caſe to do the like good, maye receyue the ſame triumph of your deſert.

Uncomely contumely of

euery trifle, and foule contempt of law and right, did euer play a part. This euil growing great, manifeſt inſurrections wer made againſt the ſtate, mightie and fierce armyes were rayſed againſt the countrey, baniſhed mē ſtriuing for reſtitutiō, or magiſtrates contending among themſelues, for offices at home, or army abroade. Some there were, in power like princes, and as Monarkes, made leaders of ſeditious armies: ſome would not leaue the army that was deliuered them of the people: ſome without authoritie, would leuie ſtraunge ſouldiers againſt their enimies, ſtriuing whether of thē ſhould firſt get the Citie, in word againſt the cōtrary factiō, but in déede againſt ye countrey: for they inuaded it, as an enemy. Cruell murders were vſed in ſome, in others proſcriptions to deathe, baniſhments, conſiſcations, & torments intollerable, ſo as no kinde of crueltie was left undone, till Cornelius Sylla, one of the mightie Captaines of rebellion, fifty yeares after Gracchus healing euil with euil, made himſelfe a Monarke for a time: the which kinde of officers, they called Dictators, vſed in moſt daungerous times, and commonly giuen ouer after ſixe monethes were ended. But Sylla, being in déede Dictator by force,
                        Dictator, vvas he that ruled alone, yet at the battell he might not be on horſebacke. perpetuall, yet in ſpeach pretending to be elected, when he had his fill of that rule alone, was the firſt man, (as I thinke) that durſt fréely giue ouer a Tiranicall power, affirming he woulde aunſwere for his doings, if any woulde accuſe him: and in the ſighte of all ſortes, as a priuate man, many times he went to the common place, and returned home againe without hurte. Suche a feare was there yet of his aucthoritie, in them that beheld hym, or an aſtoniſhmente, of the reſigning of it, or a reuerence, that hée offered to aunſweare for hys doyngs, or ſome other curteſie and conſideration, acknowledging his Tyranny to haue bene profitable to the countrey.
                  Thus a while ſedition ceaſſed with Sylla, and there was a remedie of the euils that Sylla had done: but after hym it began againe,

The lawe of landes was pronounced, and the firſte officers appoynted to ſée it executed, was Gracchus hymſelfe the lawmaker, and a brother of hys name, and Appius Claudius hys father in lawe. So muche dyd the people feare, that all the laboure of the lawe ſhoulde bée loſt, vnleſſe Gracchus and all hys familie hadde the execution of it. Gracchus was maruellouſly magnifyed for thys lawe, and accompanyed of the people to his houſe as a preſeruer, not of one Citie or Countrey, but of all the nations of Italy. Thys béeyng done, they that had the day, returned to the landes in the Countrey from whence they came for that purpoſe, but they that loſt the day, remayned diſcontented, and talked that Gracchus ſhoulde not eſcape blame when he ſhoulde bée out of office, that durſt violate a Magiſtrate of ſo greate authoritie, and gyue occaſion of ſo manifeſt ſedition in Italy. Nowe was it Sommer, and the tyme of chooſing Tribunes at hande. It ſéemed that the ryche woulde ſo laboure, as the office ſhould bée gyuen to ſome of Gracchus greateſt enimies. The tryall béeyng at hande, and hée afrayde that hée ſhoulde not bée elected Tribune for the yeare to come, called people out of the Countrey, to gyue voyce in the election, but they béeyng occupyed in Sommer buſineſſe, and the daye drawyng nygh, hée was

When the daye was come, the two firſte companyes choſe Gracchus, but the ryche men cryed, that it was not lawfull for one to bée Tribune twyce togyther. Rubrio a Tribune, to whoſe turne it

                           The contention béeyng greate, and Gracchus hauyng the worſe, he deferred the diſcuſſing tyll the nexte daye, and béeyng vtterlye diſcouraged, although yet in office, he remayned the reſt of the whole daye in the common place, beſéechyng euerye man to bée hys helpe, as though he ſhoulde ſtreyghte haue bin deſtroyed of hys enimies. The poore men were moued wyth compaſſion, and conſideryng that they were not vſed indifferently as Citizens, but rather as ſlaues to the luſt of the ryche, and fearyng for Gracchus ſtate, who ſuffered for theyr ſake with lamentation, they all broughte hym to hys houſe at nyghte, and bade hym bée of good chéere agaynſte the nexte daye.

                               yet he had deuiſed a ſhift and a ſubtiltie for it, and that was this, that a man might ſweare to the words of the lawe ſo farre forthe as it was lawfull, and ſo for the time the Countrey people mighte be ſente home, and after it might be well proued that it was no law, which by violence and by the thundering of Iupiter was made contrary to the order of the Countrey. Whē he had ſayd thus, euery man was ſilent for feare of entrapping, and the ſuddayneſſe of the time: wherefore he aroſe and went to the Temple of Saturne, where the common treaſourers ſhoulde ſweare. Himſelfe ſware firſt, & ſo did his friēds: other Senators did the like for feare. Only Metellus would not ſweare, continuing
                                 Metellus refuſeth the oth. in his former ſentence without dread. Apuleius the nexte day ſent a Sergeant to pull him out of the Courte, but the Tribunes defended him. Then Apuleius and Claudius ranne to the Countrey multitude, affirming that they neither could haue lād, nor law take place, vnleſſe Metellus were baniſhed: wherefore a decrée of his baniſhmente was made, and a Proclamation from the Conſull, that no man ſhould ſuccoure Metellus, neyther wyth

fyre nor water: and one only day was giuen him for deliberation of the matter. The people of the Citie were offended, andThe moderatiō of Metellus.
                               wente aboute Metellus with their weapons: he thanked them for their good will, but ſaid, his Countrey ſhould not be brought into trouble for him. So Apuleius pronounced the decrée of his exile,
                                 Metellus banished. and Marius confirmed it. Thus was the moſt worthy man of the Citie baniſhed, after the which Apuleius was Tribune the third time, and for his fellow, one Gracchus a runnagate was appoynted,
                                 Gracchus the runnagate, vvho vvas aduanced by Marius.

The election of the Conſuls being at hand, Marcus Antonius was choſen for the one, without any ſticking: for the other, Glaucias and Memmius contended. Memmius was of more eſtimation in the Citie. Glaucias and Apuleius feared themſelues, and ſente certayne men with waſters into the aſſemblie, whiche layde vpon Memmius, and kylled
                                 Memmius killed. him. Thus was the ſolemne aſſemblie diſturbed, no regarde being had now of law or iuſtice, nor reuerēce of God or man. The people was gréeued at it, and the nexte day gathered togither to diſpatche Apuleius, but he got the company of his new multitude of Countreymē, with Glaucias and C. Sapheius a treaſourer, and tooke the Capitoll. The Senate commaunded they ſhoulde be taken and diſpatched, but Marius vnwilling to it, did for a ſhew arme men very ſlowly. Some there were that did cutte away the water that wente into the Temple, wherefore Sapheius that could not abide the lacke of water, perſuaded thē to ſet the Temple a fyre, but Glaucias and Apuleius yéelded themſelues firſt, and after ſo did Sapheius. And where euery man called vpon their execution, Marius ſhutte them in the Senate houſe, as to deale with them more according to lawe. But the people perceiuing this to be a delay, pulled the ſtaues of y• roofe of the Tēple, and neuer left throwing vpon them, till they had killed all thrée,
                                 Sapheius, Glauclas and Apuleius killed. whereof one was a Queſtor, an other a Tribune, and the third a Pretor, and all at that time clad with the robes of their office. With them alſo was ſlayne a greate number of the people, entangled with their ſedition, and in it the other Tribune, that was thought to be ſonne to Gracchus, the firſt day of the entring

After Apuleius and the reſt were killed, the Senate and the people decréede to call home Metellus, but P.

When the Uſurers hearde Aſellius make mention of the olde law, they were gréeued, and kylled him after this manner: It was his turne to make oblation in theSacrifice to Iupiters childrē. common place to Iupiters children, the multitude ſtanding about the ſacrifice, one of the former threw a ſtone at him, and hit him, wherefore he flong downe the veſſell of ſacrifice, and ranne toward

Theſe murthers and ciuill diſſentions hapned yet now and then, but afterward Captaynes of ſedition with great armies contended togither by law of warre, their Countrey ſtāding as a pray to them that could catch it, the beginning & procéeding whereof

                           Greate lamentation was made throughout the whole Legion: wherefore theſe Captaines on their knées prayed hym of pardon. He hardly and at length graūted, and came to this only, that anye 120. that were moſte buſie, ſhoulde bee taken by lotte, and twelue of their Captaines of bandes, be put to death: for one of the twelue, whiche was not preſente, nor a medler in thys Mutenye, he cauſed hys accuſer to ſuffer for hym.
                           After this ſorte was the ſedition at Placentia appeaſed. Caeſar went to Rome, and the people for feare choſe hym Dictator, neyther the Senate allowing it, nor none officer pronoūcing it: but hee, refuſing that dignitye, eyther as odious, or ſuperfluous, ruling onely eleuen dayes (as ſome ſay) appointed Conſuls for the reſte of the tyme, hymſelfe, and Seruilius Iſauricus.

people deſiring alſo a cutting off of debte, bycauſe thynges bare no price, by reaſon of the wars and ſeditions, he denyed it them, but he appointed Purueyors of victualls, whiche in ſtéede of the debte, ſhoulde take order betwene the creditours and ye debtore. When he had done this, he ſente all hys army to Brunduſe in the

The people followed him, and prayed hym to be at one with Pompey, for now it was very euident, that he that ouercame woulde be a ruler alone, but he went on, and lefte nothing that was to be done with power and ſpéede.
                           
                              Pompey al this tyme made Ships, and ſtill gathered greater armies, and more money. He tooke fortie of Caeſars ſhippes, in the Ionian ſea, and wayted for his cōming. He exerciſed his people, ryding and running among them, and doing euery labor beyond his olde yeares, whereby he got much loue, and euery man came to ſée Pompeys exerciſes, as to a ſpectacle.

Which of theſe do you thinke wil beare to be depriued y• things they haue enioyed, vnleſſe you wil fyll all with warres, that are deſirous to heale youre countrey that is nowe moſt féeble wyth diſeaſe.

had, or that they looked to haue of Cities and Countreys? Thys laſt night did ſhew vs an Image of this matter, for whē you did intreate for the offendoures, they on the contrary ranne aboute with threatnings. Do you thinke they can abide to ſée Caeſars body violated, torne & vnburyed (for theſe things by law are wente to be done againſte Tyrants) whiche haue ſerued in the warres with him, and to haue the gayne gotten by the victories of France and England confirmed vnto them, when he that was the gyuer of them, is ſo deſpightfully handled? what thinke you the people of Rome will do? what thinke you the Italians? what hate ſhal you haue both of God and man, if you do ſo defile your empire, enlarged from the Oceane ſea, to the people vnknowen: for you ſhall not lacke reproufe and blame for this youre inconſtancie, more than they that thinke you worthy honor, that killed a Conſull in the Counſell houſe, an holye man in an holy place, Senatoures being the doers in the ſighte of the Gods, and diſhonor him, that of his enimies is moſt honored: from theſe things as vnlawfull and not in your power, I do warne you to refrayne. Then thys ſentence I giue, that Caeſars actes and decrées doe remayne firme and ſtable, that the offenders be prayſed in no wiſe, for it is not godly, iuſt, not conſonant, Caeſars actes being ratified, that of mercye onely you will pardon them for their friends and kinſfolkes ſake, ſo as they do ſo accept it, and will of thē confeſſe it in thākeful part. When Antony had ſaid this, with great contention and vehemency the decrée was made, all other being ſilent and content: That there ſhould be no action for Caeſars death: That all his actes and decrées ſhould be confirmed, ſo as they were commodious for the citie. And this, with much adoe, did the friends of theDecrees. offendoures cauſe to be added for their ſafetie, that they were not more kepte for iuſtice ſake, than for profite. Antony gaue place vnto it.

                                 France inuaded his Countrey with enimies armes, and Pompey, a ſingulare fauourer of the people, had ſuffered, as euery man

knoweth: after hym a nūber of good Citizens wente into Iberia & Libya, & were deſtroyed. We at his deſire gaue him ſecurity, and as it ſhould ſéeme, afrayde of himſelfe, ſeking to make his Tyrāny ſure, we ſware vnto it. If he had required vs to ſwere not only to confirme the things paſt, but alſo to haue bene hys ſlaues in time to come, what woulde they then haue done that nowe lie in wayte for our liues? I ſuppoſe verye Romaines indéede, wyll rather chooſe certaine death, as they haue oft done, than by an othe to abyde willing ſeruitude. If Caeſar hitherto haue gone aboute nothing to make vs ſeruile, we confeſſe we haue broken our othe: but if neyther offices in the Citie, nor prouinces in y• country, nor armies, nor dignities of the church, nor aſſigning of inhabitance, nor other honours be left to vs, or had the cōſent of the Senate, or the allowance of the people, but did all by his owne commaundement: if his ambition was neuer ſatiate, as Syllas was, who, when he had ouerthrown his enemies, reſtored to vs the common wealth: if he making another armye for a long time, toke awaye our election for fiue yeares, what libertie was this, when no hope coulde appeare? what ſhould we ſay of the peoples chiefe officers, Seſetius and Marullus, were they not with contumely thruſt frō the ſacred & inuiolate offices? and where the lawe and othe of our aunceſtours do not ſuffer any actiō to be made againſt y• Tribunes, yet Caeſar baniſhed them and ſhewed no cauſe: whither thē haue offēded againſt the holy Tribunes, we, or Caeſar? being a ſacred and inniolate man, to whom, not willingly, but of neceſſitie, we graunted theſe things, nor before he came agaynſt his country in armour, and had killed ſo many noble Citizens. The office of the Tribunes can not be holy nor inniolated, to the whiche our fathers in time of common welth dyd ſweare without cō

forefathers neuer had néede of anye. But if any other wil aſpire to tyrannie, there is no fayth, no not with an othe, between the Romames and a Tiranne. Thus we ſpeake now in perill, and will euer ſpeake it for our country. For being in honoure and ſafety with Caeſar, we preferred the honour of our countrey before our owne: wel they vſe calumniation againſte vs and ſtirre you for the habitations. If here be any preſent, eyther y• hath, or ſhalbe appointed to thoſe inhabitance, I pray you do ſo much at my requeſt as giue a token of your ſelues. Many dyd ſo: then ſayde he: Oh well done (good men) that you be come to do as other do, and it is conuenient that you which indifferentlye doe trauayle and laboure for youre countrey, ſhoulde receyue equal reward of the ſame. The people of Rome did appoint you to Caeſar againſte the Engliſh and French men: it is therefore reaſon, that hauing done good ſeruice, you receyue as good rewards. But he bound you with oths and vnwillingly led you againſt the Citie: he led you likewiſe againſt the beſte Citizens in Libya: likewiſe againſt your wils. If your trauayle had ben only in this, paraduenture you would haue bin aſhamed to aſhe recompence: but the ſeruice that you did in France and England, no enuie, no time, no obliuion of man, can put out of memorie: and for theſe, the beſte recompence which the people was wont to giue to the old ſouldiers, not taking away mens landes or houſes that had not offended, nor giuing to one that was an others, nor thinking they ought to recompence with iniuſtice, nor when they had conquered their enimies, to take away all their land, but made a particion, and appointed ſome of their ſouldiers to dwel there, as a garriſon for the cō

                              Octauius, Caeſars ſiſters nephew, was made of Caeſar generall of the horſemen for one yeare, and this honor Caeſar vſed to gyue to his friends from yeare to yeare.

Hauing bin now ſixe monethes in Velona, about the euening, it was told that Caeſar was ſlayne in the Senate houſe, of them that he loued beſt, and might doe moſt with hym.

After thys, his friendes ſente to hym from Rome, wiſhing him to goe to the hoſt of Macedonia for his ſuretie, in the which place, after it ſhuld be knowen, that it was no common fact, he might be a terror to his enimies, in reuenging of Caeſar, and diuers of the Captaynes promiſed him, that if he woulde come to them, they woulde ſée hym ſafe.

Being come to Rome, his mother, & Philip, and their friendes came vnto him, and againe prayed him, not to diſſente from the Senate, bycauſe it was decréed, that there ſhoulde be no queſtion of Caeſars deathe. Further, they feared Antony and his power, who neyther came himſelfe to méete Caeſars ſonne, nor ſent any man to receyue hym, all the whiche Octauius tooke very temperately, and ſaid, it wasIn deſire of Octauius.

                                 Caeſar had made of him in ſo great matters, ſéeing he himſelf was wont to contemne all maner of perill. Then turning to his mother,

                           This word (quoth he) did winne Achilles immortall fame, but much more the déede, and that he ought to reuenge Caeſar, not as a friende, but as a father: not as a fellowe Souldiour, but as a Generall: not dying by lawe of warre, but murthered

wickedly in the Senate houſe. For this ſpéeche, his mother, from feare, turned to you, embraced him, affirming he only was worthy for Caeſar.

for the ſtrikers as killers of a Tyrante, Caeſar had bin iudged a Tyrant, to whome, neyther glory, nor honor, nor eſtabliſhmente of his actes had bin made, neyther Teſtament, ſonne, or ſubſtāce had bin ſtayd, nor his bodye bin thought worthy buriall, no not as a priuate man, for the law doth commaund the bodyes of Tyrants to be caſt vnburied, their memorie to be raced, and theyr goodes to be made common, all the which I fearing, did contend for Caeſars immortall glorye, and for his publike buriall, neyther without perill nor enuie of mine owne perſon, of men fierce and full of bloudſhed, and as thou mayſt know, conſpiring agaynſte me, and of the Senat that could euill beare thy fathers gouernement: but I thought rather to offer my ſelfe to peril and trouble, than to ſuffer Caeſar to be diſhonored and vnburyed, the beſt of all other men, moſt fortunate in his affaires, and of all other vſing me moſt honorably. By theſe mine onely perils, thou haſt preſently theſe ſingulare benefites of Caeſar, his bloud▪ his name, hys dignitie, and his ſubſtance, for all the whyche, thou oughteſt rather to giue me thankes, than to reprehende me for anye thyng done for the appeaſing of the Senate, for the recompence of ſuch as had deſerued, or for other commodities and conſiderations, ſéeyng thou art yong in reſpect to me: therefore this ſhall be ſufficient, for that thou ſpakeſt héerein. Thou doeſt glance at mée, as though I were deſirous of rule only, which I neuer coueted, and yet haue bin thought not altogither vnworthy of it.

Many other actions of iniurie were put vp againſte him extraordinarily, and they grew infinit, in ſo much as Pedius and Pinarius, to whom Caeſar had giuen a portion of land, complayned of Antony for thēſelues and for Caeſar, as they that ſuffered wrōg by the Senates decrée, affirming he ought to reiect onely matters of deſpight, and al other of Caeſars doings he ſhould confirm. He anſwered, that things done peraduēture, had ſome contrarietie with the Senates decrée, and (quoth he) the decrée may be written contrary to the meaning. For where only obliuion of iniuries was graunted, there was no alteratiōs of the former procéedings, neyther for his ſake, nor to be playne, for anye of their ſakes, rather than a deuice to apea

Yet he ſayd he would fauour them, whē they had diuided with Caeſar. Thus did Antony anſwere Pinarius, who ſtreight made diuiſion, leaſt their partes ſhoulde be conſumed in ſutes, not for themſelues but for Caeſar, whom not long after they muſt gratify in all.

                           Now were the playes of Brutus ſhewed in moſt ample manner.The playes diſturbed. When certaine hyred men, did cry that Brutus and Caſsius might be called home, and the reſt of the Theatre did agrée vnto them for their pardon, the other ruſhed in by heapes, and marred all the playe, and quenched their inſtant requeſt. Brutus and Caſsius vnderſtanding that Caeſar had daſhed their hope in the ſhewe, they determined to goe to Syria and Macedonia by force, as prouinces appointed to them before Antony and Dolobella.
                           
                           This being euident, Dolobella alſo went into Syria, and made haſt by the way, to make money in Aſia. Antony deſired much to haue the army of Macedonia, as very fit for the maintenāce of his power, being in vertue beſt, and in power moſt, (for they were ſire legions) beſide other number of Archers, Darters, and light armed, with many horſemen and other greate furniture for the warre, al the whiche he feared ſhould follow Dolobella into Syria, going againſt the Parthians, whether Caeſar had appointed them.

Wherfore Antony required his armie of the Senate, that he myght puniſh the Geetes, bycauſe they were firſt appointed againſt thē of Caeſar, & ſo that all was nowe quiet wyth the Parthians. The

Senate ſuſpected this rumor, and ſente to vnderſtande the certainty of it.
                           
                              Antony, to deliuer them of feare and ſuſpition hereof, decréed
                                 Antony deuiſeth to ſtoppe the creation of a Dictator. that for no cauſe it ſhould be lawfull to create a Dictator, nor that any man ſhould take it, though it were giuen him: and if any man did perceyue anye to contemne this order, it ſhoulde be lawfull to kill him whereſoeuer he were mette. By this meanes he did temper the hearers, and practiſing with Dolobellas friend to giue him one legion, he was choſen captaine of the army, & Lieuetenant of Macedonia. Hauing now what hée would, he ſent his brother Caius in al haſt to cary the decrée to y• army.
                           They that wente to vnderſtande of the Geetes being returned, affirmed that they ſawe no Geetes in Macedonia, but they added (either ſaying true, or being taught of Antony what they ſhold ſay:) It was to be feared, if the army were taken away, the Geetes would ouerrunne Macedonia.

And if anye manne dydde affraye them from that mynde, it was not doone for deſire and care of my life, but for a reſpecte onelye that they woulde not ſéeme to perſecute their ennimies, but to diſpatche a Tyran. Who then can thinke that I doe forgette Caeſar my benefactour, or haue more eſtéemed his enimies than him, or woulde willingly forgyue them his death, that haue ſought mine, as this new Caeſar
                                 
thinketh? How then commeth the obliuion of his deathe, and their aduancemēt to prouinces: for this he obiecteth againſt me, and not the Senate? Heare you then how it hathe come to paſſe. Caeſar being ſlayne in the Senate houſe, euery man was afrayd, and I moſt of all for Caeſars friendſhip, and ignorance of the facte, for I neyther hearde of the comuration, nor vnderſtoode howe manye were of the conſpirancie. The people was in tumulte, and the ſtrikers with the ſwordplayers tooke the Capitoll, and made themſelues faſt, and the Senate was of their ſide, whyche is nowe more euident, bycauſe they decréed honors to them, as to the killers of a Tyrant, and if Caeſar were a Tyrant, then muſt we haue bin deſtroyed ſtrayght, as friends to a Tyrante. So I béeyng troubled with tumult, with feare and ſorrow, coulde not vſe reaſon, nor bée without perplexitie, as you maye perceyue, if you will conſider, for on the one ſide, was néede of boldneſſe vehemente, and on the other diſſimulation extreame. Firſte thys was to be done (the reſidue eaſlie followyng) to take away the honor to be gyuen to the ſtrikers, againſte th

                                  whiche I onely ſtandyng, reſiſted both the Senate, and them, and broughte to paſſe with greate payne, vſing eindente courage, onely offering my ſelfe to that perill, ſuppoſing that wée, Caeſars friendes, ſhould be in ſuretie, if he

                                  were not condemned as a Tyrant. The lyke feare troubled our enimies and the Senate, that if he were not iudged a Tyrant, they ſhoulde be accompted manquellers. And for thys contention, I thoughte it beſt to gyue place, and to allow obliuion of hys death, in ſtead of honor to be giuen to them, that I mighte wynne of them, as muche as by neceſſitie I coulde. And this was the manner of my doings, that neyther I dyd ſuffer Caeſars name to be aboliſhed, nor his ſubſtance to bée confiſcate, nor his adoption (in the whiche this man nowe moſt gloryeth) to be diſſolued, nor his teſtament to be fruſtrated. Hys bodye I cauſed to be buryed princely, and honoures due vnto him before, to be conſecrated as immortall, and all his actes and decrées to be kept firme and ſure, and hys ſonne and our friends the Captaynes and the Souldioures, to be in good ſafetie, and to liue in honor in ſtead of rebuke.

The whyche I haue not done of that purpoſe, but to turne the courſe to the contrarye. For when I hadde brought the Senate to that that was profitable to vs, and allowed the killers to remayne in quiet, I did ouerthrowe the Obliuion, not by decrée nor ſtatute (for that I coulde not) but by an earneſt iealouſie of the people, bringing Caeſars bodye to be buryed in the common place, and cauſing hys woundes to bée ſéene of the multitude, ſhewyng his veſture bloudy and mangled, and declaring his vertue and beneuolence to the people, wéeping when I made the mourning Oration. I called hym by the name of a kylled God. Theſe were my wordes and workes, whereby the people was ſo prouoked, as in ſtead of Obliuion, they tooke fire, and wente to the quellers houſes, and in the ende drone them out of the Citie. Howe thys was contrarye to the Senate, they béeyng gréeued wyth it, it was euidently ſéene. For they accuſed me firſt of ambition, and appoynted prouinces to Brutus and Caſsius, Syria, and Macedonia, whyche were full of greate armyes. And leaſt they ſhoulde ſéeme to make haſt before theyr tyme, they gaue them pretence to prouide grayne for the Citie. Wherefore a greater feare dyd yet trouble me, for lacke of an appoynted armye, as menne naked to ſyghte wyth ſo manye well armed, my fellowe béeyng a man ſuſpected, and diſagréeyng from me, and one of the conſpirators agaynſte Caeſar, and appoynted to bée héere at the daye of hys deathe. For theſe thyngs béeyng in great trouble, and ſéekyng with ſpéede to diſarme oure enimies, and to arme oure ſelues, I kylled Amatius. I thoughte good to call home Pompey, that by thys meane I mighte ioyne the Senate agayne. Yet not much truſtyng them, I perſuaded Dolobelia to aſke Syria, not of the Senate, but of the people, by a lawe to bée made: and in hys ſute I furthered hym, of a friende to make hym an enimie to the ſtrikers: and that it ſhoulde ſéeme verye

vnfytte for the Senate to denye me Macedonia, ſéeyng they hadde graunted Syria to Dolobella, for otherwiſe woulde they not haue graunted mée that prouince, nor delyuered me that armye, excepte they hadde firſte graunted to Dolabella the ſame, to goe agaynſte the Parthians: nor they woulde not haue taken from Brutus and Caſsius, Syria and Macedonia, vnleſſe they hadde appoynted ſome other prouinces to them for theyr ſuretie. Néedes muſt they appoynte one for another, but what manner ones, Cyrene and Creta, voyde of armies, whyche they oure enimies, in contempte, haue lefte as vnprofitable, and by violence, haue entred the other, whyche wée tooke from them. Thus was oure armye putte from oure enimies to Dolabella, by deuice and ſleighte, and exchange of other prouinces: for where warre was not, there muſt thinges bée done by lawe. This béeyng thus broughte to paſſe, and oure enimies gathering another armye, I hadde néede of the ſame my ſelfe, that was in Macedonia, yet wanted occaſion to require it. When the fame came that the Getes woulde inuade Macedonia, whyche not béeyng beléeued, eſpies were ſente to vnderſtande the truth, I decreed, that no man ought to aſke the Dictatorſhippe, nor to take it though it were gyuen hym. By the whych thyng they béeyng chiefly allured, appoynted me the armye, and then dyd I thinke my ſelfe equall with mine enimies, not theſe that be euidente, as Octauius thynketh, but other moe in number, greater in power, and not yet appearing. When I had done this, one of the ſtrikers remayned ſtill hard at our ſides, Decimus Brutus. He béeyng a gouernoure of a greate countrey, and a mighty armye verye bolde, I deuiſed to take hys prouince from hym, yet wyth a regarde of the Senate, promiſing to delyuer Macedonia voyde of armye. The Senate takyng the thyng euill, and perceyuing ſome deuice to bée hadde, what and howe greate matter was written to Decimus, you knowe, and to ſtirre the Conſulles agaynſte mée, wherefore wyth the more boldeneſſe dyd I practiſe to wynne that prouince, not by the Senate, but by the people and lawe, and to haue the armye of Macedonia come to Brund

He declared this to be done by all coniecture, to diſpatche hys perſon, whiche matter béeyng quietly heard, cauſed muche adoe and indignation among the people. A fewe that were grounded vppon reaſon, were glad that Antony myghte doe Caeſar good, and alſo hurte at hys pleaſure, bycauſe hée was terrible to the ſtrikers, and if hée were once diſpatched, they myghte wyth the more ſecuritie, doe theyr feates, bycauſe the Senate chiefly fauoured them. Thus the wyſer ſorte did thinke: but the multitude ſéeyng that deſpight and hynderance was dayly offered to Octauius, they thoughte it not vnlike to be a calumniation, and yet ſuppoſed it not good

nor honeſt, that Antony beyng Conſull, ſhoulde bée in daunger of hys perſon. Octauius Caeſar with greate anger and furie wente among them that were of thys opinion, and cryed, that hée was circumuented of Antony, for the frendſhyppe that he onely had with the people, and ranne to Antonyes houſe, and there he exclaymed

And with that, he brake in at the dores, but béeyng kepte backe, he ſware, and rebuked them that kepte the gates, bycauſe they ſtopped hym from making further tryall wyth Antony.

                           It was euident in the ende, that they woulde bend againſt Antony, and bycauſe they had no army, and coulde gather none wythout the Conſuls auctoritie, they deferred all till the newe election.

                           He thanked them for the honoure, but referred the matter to the Senate, & them that wolde haue gone by heaps for this purpoſe, he forbad, and ſtaied them that would haue ſent Ambaſſadours, that the Senate (quoth hée) maye take order for it of themſelues, vnderſtanding of your offer, and my refuſall. They hardly beeyng contented this waye, and the Capitaines conſtruing it as men had in ſome ſuſpition, he declared vnto them, that the Senate dyd not rather encline to him for good will, than for feare of Antony, and want of army, til we (quoth he) haue diſpatched Antony.

                              The prouince of Fraunce we did not appoint to Antony: the people did by lawe, Cicero being preſent, in ſuch ſort as manye other be giuen, and heretofore gaue the ſame to Caeſar in like maner. Part of the decrée is, that Antony ſhould make warre vpon Decimus if he would not giue place vnto him, and that the army prepared againſt the Thracians, (who ſtirreth not) ſhoulde be led againſt him, if he reſiſted. Cicero doth not iudge Decimus an enemye that maketh warre againſte the lawe, but Antony, that obeyeth the lawe. If he condemneth hym, hee condemneth them that made the lawe, whome hee ought by perſuaſion to pacific, and not to prouoke by contumelie. Neither ought he to credite that place to Decimus, whō the people haue banniſhed for murder, & diſcredite Antony, to whom the people haue giuen it by law. It is no good counſel to make diuiſion with the people, eſpecially in daūgerous times, nor to forget, that this belongeth chiefly to the people, to iudge of friendes and foes: for by the auntient lawes, the people only is Lord of war and peace, in the whiche at this time notwithſtanding they haue not appointed, nor commaunded, nor vſed their priuiledge ouer vs. But (he ſaith) Antony killed certain Souldiours, being general and appointed therevnto by you. Neuer was there Captaine generall, that was charged wyth that offīce. For the lawes haue not thought it méete, that the Captaine ſhould be ſubiect to the Souldiours: and there is nothing worſe in a campe, than diſobedience, by the whiche ſome conquerours haue bene ouerthrowen. None of them that were puniſhed, haue complayned, nor none of their friendes or kinſfolke. But Cicero hath accuſed, and finding fault at their death, inſtead of ſuch honor as hath ben wont to be giuen to ſuch executers, he wil haue Antony exclaymed an enimy.

to ſuche inconuenience hath enmity caried Cicero. He accuſeth Antonies Tyranny alſo, and murder of ſouldiours, wheras they that ſéeke miſchiefe to their countries, euer do pleaſe their armies, and not ſo puniſh thē. And bycauſe he can accuſe Antony of none other matter of Tiranny after Caeſars rule, go to, I wil aſke him queſtions of euery thing. Whom hath Antony killed vnharde, as a Tyrant, who now him ſelfe vnhard is in daunger to be condemned? whome hath he vaniſhed? whom hath he caſt out? hath he bin ſo to euery particular man? hathe he layde traynes for vs all at once when (O Cicero) he decreed forgetfulneſſe of all things done? or that no man ſhoulde proſecute the murder? or that a ſearch ſhoulde be made of common Treaſure? or when he called home Pompey, your Pompeis ſonne? or when he wiſhed he might be recompenced of the common, for his fathers ſubſtaunce? or when he diſpatched the counterfayte Marius? whom then you al prayſed and now only, in that Cicero will not, you diſprayſe? or when he determined that no Dictator ſhould be created or ſpoken of: or when he ordayned that he that would, ſhoulde dye for it. Theſe were the things that Antony did to vs in two monethes, when he alone remayned in the Cittie after Caeſar: when by and by the people purſewed the ſtickers, when by and by we were afrayde of things to come. When, if he woulde haue taken his occaſion and haue bene vmuſt, he coulde not haue had a better, yet hée dyd not vſe hys power to the contrary. What did not he alone rule, when Dolobella was gone into Syria? What dyd not he vſe hys army preſte, to al purpoſes in the Citie, whyche you appointed to hym? did he not watch the Citie? was not he himſelf garded by night for feare of his enimies? had he not occaſiō by Caeſars death, his friend, and benefactour, and moſt deare to the people? Had he not another, more nere whē his body was laid for of mē, of whom he neyther baniſhed, nor put to death any but rather fauoured them as much as by reaſō & honeſty he coulde, not enuying them? Theſe you ſée. O Romaines, be the greateſt, and moſt doubtful matters that Cicero hathg athered againſt him, and to hys accuſations he ioyneth deuination:

as thoughe Antony woulde haue broughte ſo greate an armye, againſte the Cittie, but that hee was afrayde of Octauius Caeſar, that preuented hym wyth an other armye. If to entende onely ſo, bee the parte of a manne that is an ennimye, why doeth hee not counte hym one that came and encamped in the Cittye, and gaue you no warnyng of it? If Antony woulde come, howe hapte it hee came not? was hée afrayde of Caeſars thrée thouſande vnarmed, he hauyng thirtye thouſand well armed? They came onely to Caeſar for to helpe to a pacifycation betwéene them, but when they ſaw that warre would follow, they forſooke hym. If he were afrayde when hée had thyrtie thouſande? howe came he hither with one thouſande? with the whyche goyng to Tibure, howe manye dyd wee ſende vnto hym? howe manye of vs wente to bee ſworne of hym, that were not ſworne before? what prayſes dyd Cicero make of hys good gouernemente and vertue? howe woulde Antony, if hee hadde knowen thys, haue lefte wyth vs the pledges that nowe bee without the Senate houſe, hys mother, hys wife and hys young ſonne, whyche lamente and feare nowe, not of Antonies doyngs in the common wealthe, but for hys ennimyes power.

                              Thys haue I ſpoken to the hearers, without enuye or emulation. But for them that inconſiderately and vnaduiſedly ſéeke to trouble▪ you for priuate grudge or diſpleaſure, I ſhall beſéeche the Judges not to bée to quicke nor ſwifte againſte ſo greate men, and leaders of ſo mightye armyes, that they doe not force them to make warre againſte their wyli, remembryng Marcus Coriolanus, and the late Caeſar, whom, bringing an armye likewiſe, and offring verye good conditions of concorde, wee raſhelye condemned as enimye, and of neceſſitie made him to bee ſo indéede. Let vs beare wyth the people, that while earſt did ſtirre againſte the ſtrykers of Caeſar, that we ſéeme not, to hys reproch, to giue them prouinces of nations, nor prayſe Decimus, bycauſe hee deſpiſeth the peoples lawe, and condemne Antony, bycauſe hee receyueth Fraunce by the peoples order. And it behoueth them that bee of good iudgement, to redreſſe them that goe aſtraye, and the Conſuls and Tribunes to prouide for the daungers of the preſent ſtate.
                           
                           Thus dyd Piſo ſpeake in defence, with cries and ſharpe wordes, and was the onlye cauſe why Antony was not iudged a rebell. Yet coulde he not obtayne that hee ſhoulde haue the prouince of Frenche Celtica. For the friendes and kinſefolke of the killers for feare did lette it, leaſte the warre ſhoulde ceaſſe, and hee bee at one with Octauius, and they both reuenge Caeſars deathe. Wherefore theyr practiſe and deuiſe was to kepe Antony and Octauius ſtyll at debate.

                           Thus Cicero ambitiouſly and vniuſtly dyd appointe his determinations, not for anye ſo great priuate enmitie, but as it ſhoulde ſéeme, by deſtinye that was determined to trouble the ſtate with mutation, and bring himſelfe to ſome euill happe in the ende.

when no man would be hir ſuretie, Lepidus wayted many times at Balbinus dores, and comming where he ſate in Judgemente, and being ofte repulſed of the officers, at length (with much ado) he ſpake thus:
                           The accuſers do confeſſe mine innocencie, affirming, that

Haue reſpect vnto the chaunces of the worlde: and to me, that attende vpon thée, giue this grace, that eyther my wife may goe to Caeſar vpon my ſuretie, or I be bounde to goe with hyr.
                           Whiles Lepidus ſpake this, Balbinus conſidering the mutation,
                                 Cicero the ſon. deliuered the wife of hir bonde.
                           Yong Cicero was ſent of his father into Grecia, foreſeing what would come. From Greece he went to Brutus, & after Brutus death, to Pompey, & with both was honoured with the place of a Lieutenaunt. And after them, Caeſar, to cléere himſelf of Ciceros iniurie,The Bishops of old Rome vvere Magiſtrates & Iudges of religion. made him ſtraight the Biſhop, and not long after, Conſul, and Preſident of Syria. And whē 
                              Caeſar ouercame Antony at Actio, he was yet Conſul, and Caeſar wrote to him of it, which Letters he readde to the people of Rome, and ſate in that ſeate of Juſtice, where his fathers head was put.

They watching for his mony, a ſtorm ryſing, put him into a boate, that they might ſayle with the more ſafetie: but it chaunced, that he in the boate was ſaued beyonde all hope, and they drowned with theyr ſhippe.
                           
                              Publius, a treaſurer of Brutus, and of the familie of Anteny,
                              Publius. was requeſted to forſake Brutus, which bicauſe he would not do, he was proſcribed: yet he returned, and was a friende to Caeſar, and when Caeſar came to him, he woulde ſhewe him Brutus picture, for the which he was prayſed of Caeſar.
                           
                           Theſe things, beyonde hope, happening to the proſcribed men, both in daunger and ſafetie, many moe being omitted, I thought chiefe to be declared.
                           When matters had thus paſſed in Rome, all the places about, for theſe troubles, were ful of enimies, & great warres fell out:

In Libya of Cornificius againſt Sextius: in Syria of Caſsius againſt Dolobella: in Sicilia of Pompey, where great affliction was among the Citties for this captiuitie. I will ouerpaſſe the leſſe: the greateſt, that appeared more worthie than the reſt, in Loadicea, Tharſus, Rhodes, Patareans, and Xantheans, and euery of them, which from the beginning in order I haue gathered to write, were theſe.

And for this cauſe they made war one againſt another.

Caſsius and Brutus beyng yet Pretors in the Citie, were aſſigned alſo of Caeſar to prouinces, Caſsius to Siria, and Brutus to Macedonia. And bycauſe they coulde not goe to their prouinces before their time, nor abide the hate of the Citie,Brutus & Caſſius. they wente away, being yet in office: and the Senate, in conſideration of them, appointed them Purueioures for prouiſion, that in that meane time, they ſhoulde not be thought to flée away.

You the Rodianes louers of libertie, preferred Dolobella before vs, he ſéekyng to take the ſame from other: and vs (whome now you ought to fauour,) you pretend, you will not deale with ciuill warre. It were ciuill, if we did couet vnlawfull power: but now opē warre is made of peoples rule, againſt Tirannes ſtate: and you that haue popular gouernment, do forſake the ſame: and of them that do labour for their lawes, and beare good will to the Romanes, and be condemned to death without iudgement, that be preſcribed & confiſcate, you haue no pitie at all. But you anſweare, you will vnderſtand the Senates minde, which is now deſtroyed and can not helpe it ſelf. For ye knew the Senate had decréed to Brutus and me, that al the inhabitants betwéene Ionia and the Eaſt, ſhould obey our cōmaundements Thou makeſt a rehearſal what you haue done for vs at our wāts, for with good will you haue receyued reward againe. But you forget, that you denie help to vs, that ſuffer iniurie, for the ſauing of our liberty, whom you ought, if there had bene no friendſhip betwirt vs, but would now haue begon it, to haue ayded the cōmon cauſe of Rome, few beyng of the Dorean libertie. You bring foorth alſo leagues (lacking other matter) that Caius Caſar the firſt author of Tirannie did make with you, and ſay, that the Romanes and Rodians ſhould help one an other in their neceſſities. Helpe you then nowe the Romanes that in greateſt cauſe be in moſte perill. Caſsius a Romane borne, and a preſident of the Romanes, dothe chalenge that league, accordyng to the decrée of the Senate, in the whiche it did commaunde, that all the dwellers beyonde Ionia, ſhoulde obey vs. Brutus dothe

It is the peoples publike decrée, that the Rhodianes ſhoulde help the Romanes, euery one as they haue neede. If we be neyther officers nor Romanes, but you take vs to be fugitiues, ſtraungers, and condemned (as they name vs that haue proſcribed vs) and that you haue nothing to do with vs, but with Romanes (O Rhodianes) and their leagues, then may we make warre with you as ſtrangers, and frée from confederacie, excepte you obey vs in all that we require. Thus Caſsius, as it were dallying with Archelaus, ſent him away. 
                              Alexander and Manaſſes, Captaynes of the Rhodianes, with their thrée and thirtie Shippes, ſayled againſt Caſsius to Myndo, to preuent him in the ſea, hauing hope, lightly to ouercome him, bycauſe they made that voyage into Guido agaynſte Mithridates, when they had happy ende of the warre: and vſing rowing for a ſhew, they ſayled the firſt day to Guido, and the next,

The Romaines were heauie, and abode by it, and when they ioyned with them, ouerlayde them like a fight on foote. Caſsius with the multitude of his ſhippes did ſo beſet the enimie, that they could not compaſſe, nor retire at their pleaſure, but onely aforehande giue a charge, and retire againe: and that commoditie was taken away by the ſtreightneſſe of the place. For their commyng vpon the Romanes great ſhippes with their ſharpe ſtemmes, dyd no good, bicauſe the Romanes ſtoode vnmouable againſt their light veſſels. In the ende, thrée of the Rhodianes, with all the men in them, were taken, two were broken and ſonke, the reſt ſore beaten, fledde to the Rhodes.

Whyche matters wente after this ſorte:
                           
                              Pompey was the yonger ſonne of Pompey the greate, béeing
                                 Pompey the yonger. not accompted of Caeſar for hys youth like to archieue any matter, and remayned in Spayne. He, in companye wyth a fewe théeues, roued on the Sea, and was not knowen to be Pompeys ſonne.
                           The number of the Roners increaſing, and hauing a good bande, he confeſſed he was Pompeys chylde. Wherefore all the remnant of hys fathers and brothers armye reſorted to him, as to a familiar Captayne.

But he béeyng armed for the lyghte attemptes, ſuddaynely ſette vppon hym, and troubled hym, and tooke Cities both ſmall and greate, for the whyche cauſe Caeſar ſente Abnius Pollio to ſuccéede Carina, and to warre with Pompey, whyche at the

time that Caeſar was killed, did trie their power: after the which Pompey was reuoked of the Senate, and then he went to Maſsilia, to heare what was done, who being choſen Admirall as his father, he gathered all the Shippes he could get togither, and kept the Seas, but would not come to Rome. And when the thrée mens power began, he ſayled into Sicelie, and beſeeged the Captayne Bythinicus, that woulde not receyue him, till Hirtius and Fannius (condemned by proſcription, and fledde from Rome,) cauſed that place to be giuen to Pompey. Thus Pompey was Lord of Sicelie, hauing a Nauie and Iland nigh to Italy, and a great army, both of them he had before, and alſo of them that fledde from Rome, both bond and frée, and ſuch as the Cities of Italie ſent him, that were giuen in pray to the Souldioures: for theſe did deteſt in theyr hearts, the conqueſt of the thrée men, and as much as they could, ſecretly wrote againſt them. And as many as might get out of the Countrey, being nowe no more of their Countrey, fledde to Pompey, being at hande, and moſt accepted to the Romaines of that time. There came alſo to him Seamen from Libya and Iberia, ſkylfull in the water: in ſo muche, as Pompey was full of Captaynes, Shippes, Souldioures and money. Of the whyche when Caeſar vnderſtoode, he ſente Saluidienus with a Nauy, thinking itSaluidienus. to be an eaſie matter to put Pompey from the Sea: and he paſſed through Italy to help Saluidienus from Reggio.

The hope conſiſteth in the vertue of you that be Souldiours, and in vs whom you ſée aboute this ſeate, ſo many, and ſo great men of the Senate: and alſo, in the plentyfull furniture of all thyngs whiche you ſée, of victuall, of armure, of money, and of Shippes, of confederates of Nations and Kyngs, that of neceſſitie, they by reaſon muſte bée ready to be willyng and agrée, whome the prouiſion and common cauſe hath ioyned togyther. Whereof the twoo men our enimies do calumniate vs, you know throughly, and for that do you ſerue with vs willyngly. Therefore nowe it is fitte to declare the cauſe, whiche ſhall chiefly ſhew, that wée haue the beſte, and moſte iuſte pretence of this warre. We, that haue made Caeſar great, by folowyng hym and leading you in the warres, did continue hys friendes to the ende, ſo as it ſhall not appeare, that he was entrapte of vs for any enimity. In maters of peace, he is to be blamed, not of vs his friendes, in the which we haue bene honored, but by lawes, and order of the common wealth, whereof now no law, no rule of the beſt, nor peoples power remayneth: all the which our fathers framed, when they expelled the kings, and by othe confirmed, neuer after to receyue other: to the which othe, their poſteritie, of the ſame minde, conſenting, and puttyng from them the execrations thereof, they could not longer endure to ſée one man, though he were a friende and beneficiall, that did conuert to himſelſe the publique treaſure, the armies, the elections of officers frō the people, the gouernments of nations from the Senate. Yet he was a law in ſtéede of lawes, and a Lord in ſtéede of the people, and a Prince in all reſpectes in ſteade of the Senate. The whiche peraduenture you doe not perfitely know, but only conſider his valiantneſſe in the warre. But now you may eaſily learne it, by ye things only that touched your ſelues. You the people, in the warre, do obey your Generalles as your Lords. The ſame condition you receyue of vs agayne in peace,

the Senate prouidyng, that you be not deceyued, your ſelues being Judges and lawmakers, accordyng to your companies and ſocieties, creatyng Conſulles, Tribunes and Pretors, and by your voyces iudging ye greateſt things, puniſhing or preferring them, as they thought you worthie puniſhment or preferment. This retribution (O Citizens,) hath brought your authoritie toThe authority of the people. highe felicitie: for you haue preferred the worthy, and they being preferred, haue rendred like thanke to you. For this worthineſſe you made Scipio Conſull, when you teſtified for him in the

What néede I to rehearſe many things that you already knowe, but that, fince Caeſar bare rule, you coulde create, neyther Conſull, Pretor, Tribune or Officer, nor coulde teſtifie for any mans vertue, nor receyue mutuall teſtification for your ſelues. And to ſpeake of the chief, no man gaue you thankes for any office, for authoritie, for iuſtice or correction. And that that was moſte to be lamented of all other, you could not helpe your Tribunes, when villanie was done them, that you ſhoulde not retayne your power continual, and make it ſure and inuiolable: but your ſelfe ſee them, that ought to haue bene vntouched, and their authoritie inuiolate, and their ornaments ſacred, to be cō

For, the Tribuneſhip is yours, not the Senates. Yet yée could not plainly accuſe that man, or bring him to iudgement, bycauſe of hys mightie armies, whiche belonging to the publique ſtate, he chalenged for hys priuate pleaſure: the whiche entendyng to be reuenged of the reſte of his Tyrannie, coniured agaynſt his body. The ſentence did neceſſarily procéede from the beſte, the ſeate was done of a fewe. So ſoone as it was done, the Senate decreed it a common agréement, and that openly, that the rewardes for killyng Tirannes might be put in vre. Antony ſtaying that, vnder a pretence of tumulte, and we not thinkyng our ſelues worthy rewarde to the Citie,

rather than by it, to helpe our countrey, this was ſtayed, bycauſe they would not any contumely ſhould be ſhewed to Caeſar, but only a releaſement of his Tyrannie, euery man decreeyng a for getfulneſſe, as a thing of moſte ſuretie, that no matter ſhoulde bee made of the murder. Antony by litle and litle withdrawing the people from vs, the Senate gaue vs great offices of prouinces and armies, commaunding all the lande betwéene Ionia & Syria to obey vs: whether puniſhing as offendours, or honoring ve, with ſolemne purple, with maſes and Sergeants? by the whiche reaſon, they called Pompey from baniſhment, beyng a yong man, and not acquaynted with the thing, but onely bicauſe he was Sonne to Pompey the great, who trauayled for the peoples rule: and bycauſe he was ſecretely in Spaine to auoyde tyrannie, they reſtored him to the value of his fathers goodes, by the common treaſure, and made him ruler of the ſea, that he mighte haue ſome authoritie, beyng of the peoples faction. What other acte or token of the Senate do yée require, than that all this was done by their ſentence? onleſſe it be not inough to confeſſe it by worde, but to do it & ſay it, and togither with their ſayings to rewarde you with great gifts, bicauſe whē they ſay it, they can performe it. Now you know how men be hādled: they be proſcribed without iudgement, & their goodes be publicate, they be killed without ſentence in their houſes, in theyr porches, in the Temples: of Souldiours, of ſeruants, of their enimies: drawen from their priuie houſes, and purſued in euery place. Where ye law permitteth a man that will, to flée into the common place, where neuer no enimies head was brought, but only armour & ſhippe ſtems, now the heds of Conſuls, of Pretors, of Tribunes, of Queſtors and of Gentlemen be brought, and a rewarde appointed for the euill. This is an inſurrection moſt cruell that euer was againſt all ſortes, a ſodaine ſlaughter of men, and a ſtraunge hate of women, children, fréemade men▪ and ſeruaunts: ſo farre and to ſuche a change is our citie turned. The authors of all this miſchiefe, be the thrée men, whiche afore other haue proſcribed their brethren, their vncles, anſwearyng one an other, our Citie (menne ſay) was taken of the wilde & barbarous. Yet the Celtes cut off no

What like thing did Tarquinius, whom, for ye iniurie done to one woman, & that procéeding of loue, & being a king they baniſhed, and for this only act, could neuer abide a kingdome. And whiles theſe thrée (O citizens) do thus, they terme vs ſeditious, & ſay they wil reuēge Caeſar. They do proſcribe thē yt were not preſent whē he was killed, of y• which, here be many whō you ſée, being cōdēned for their riches or houſes, or for fauoring ye peoples gouernmēt. By ye which reaſon, Pōpey alſo was proſcribed wt vs, beyng far of, in Iberia, when we did ye déede, bicauſe he is deſcēded of a father yt loued the peoples ſtate, & for yt he was called home of ye Senate, & made admirall of ye ſea, he is of theſe thrée men cō

And they yt with al they haue done, cānot yet performe theyr promiſe to their Souldiours, we that haue done no wrong haue performed our promiſe to you, & reſerue to do more, when time ſhould ſerue. Thus God hath ſhewed his helpe to vs doing iuſtly, and with God, you haue now to conſider men, whō you ſée here your Citizens, whō you haue ſéene your Pretors, your Cōſuls many times with prayſe, now you ſée thē fleyng to you, as to well doers, & louers of the people, taking our part, & wiſhing wel to the reſt yt we ſhal take in hand.

Macedonia they haue conſumed: now only they haue from Theſſalia, which how long can it ſerue them? Therefore when you ſée them offer to fight, then thinke they chiefely be forced by hunger, and doc chooſe death rather by their handes. Let vs contrarywiſe foreſée, that hunger may fight for vs, that we may take them the féebler and more conſumed,

Let not vs be carried with affection before due tyme: nor thinke flowneſſe, or quickneſſe to be experience: nor haue oure eie vppon the ſea backewarde, which miniſtreth to vs ſuche foode and ſeruice, when we ſee that victorie is ours without daunger, if you will abide, and not diſtruſte: that thoughe they come forth and prouoke vs, not ſtronger than we, as the worke yeſterday ſhewed, but for auoyding further feare, that all the courage, which I deſire you to kéepe, you may ſhew forth, when I ſhal require you at once, and the perfect rewards of victorie, when the gods ſhall haue giuen their ſentence of vs, by our perfect déeds, I will giue vnto you.

They dydde not gather ſo greate an armye that they mighte inhabite the Deſerte of Thracia, by making of their walles, but they made all that defence, for fearo of your comming vppon them: and now minding to kéepe in, for yeſterdaies ouerthrow, when the elder, and the more expert of the Captaines for very deſperation, kylled himſelfe, whiche is the greateſt declaration of their miſerie. Therefore when you ſhall prouoke them, and they not aunſwere, nor come from their hilles, but truſte in their holdes, in ſtéede of their handes, then you (O Romaine men) enforce them againe, as ye forced them yeſterday, thinking it ſhame to giue place as fearfull, and prouoked to refraine, and to be holden the worſe men for their kéeping in. For we come not hither to liue in the playne, nor if we

tarryed, it woulde ſuffiſe vs, but the ſpéedy attemptes are to bée giuen in warre of the wiſe, that we may the longer continue in peace. The tymes and the trauaile we muſte foreſée, of whom, you cannot complayne, for yeſterdayes aſſaulte and attempte. When you are required, then ſhewe your vertue to your capitaines, be not grieued with yeſterdayes ſpoile, for riches is not in that we haue, but in that we got by conqueſt, for that we loſt yeſterday. For it remaineth ſafe with our enimie, the which and their own, they muſt yéeld vs, when we ouercome them: & if we wil go forth to get that, then muſt we ſet forth to the ſight. Yeſterday we tooke again of theirs ſufficiētly, & happily more ſuſficient of our owne, for they haue brought togither all that they haue by violence ſpoiled oute of Aſia, and you comming as from your Countrey, haue lefte at home the moſte precious things, and onelye broughte neceſſaries. And if you hadde anye thyng of eſtimation, you compted it your Generalls, all the whyche, we be ready to giue you, for thys victorye, and for the recompence of this loſſe. For your ſake we will giue rewards of victorie, to euerye Souldioure fyue thouſand drams, to a Capitaine of a bande fyue tymes ſo muche, and to a Tribune double ſo muche as a Captaine.

When Cleopatra was gone home, he ſent his horſemen to ſpoyle the Palmirians, a Cittie not farre from Euphrates, a lighte offence beeing obiected to them, for a faſhion, bicauſe dwelling in the confines of the Romanes, and the Parthians, they ſeemed to bee of doubtful faith, for they were merchants, and brought and fetched the wares of India and Perſide, to the Romanes: but in very déede it was to enrich his horſemen. And when the Palmirians had vnderſtanding of it, they conueyed away their goods, and garded them with Archers, wherin they excelled. The horſemen finding the Citie voyde, went away emptie and vnhurtfull. Of thys occaſion the warres of Parthia ſéemed to ryſe, many of the tyrannes of the countreye of Syria reſorting to them.

                              My deſire and intent was (O ſouldiour fellowes) to haue reduced the common wealth, to that ſtate y• our anceſtors left it, bycauſe I ſawe the office of the thres men tourned into Tirannye, and not amended after the death of Brutus and Caſsius, by whome they made their pretence of warre. For Lepidus being remoued from their Collegeſhip, & Antony occupyed in far parts, this man alone dothe here what he liſteth: the lawes bée onely pretences, and ſhades. I ſeeking remedye for theſe incommodities and minding to haue reſtored the commō wealth, I required that the ſouldiors, hauing their due rewardes, the power of one might haue bin aboliſhed, which bicauſe I coulde not do, I wente aboute to doe it by force and power. Then thys man accuſed me to the army, as one that pitied the antiēt inhabitance: of the which accuſation being ignorant, & not beléeuing it when I hearde of it, bycauſe I was ſure you receyued landes by my diuiſion: yet many beléeued that falſe accuſation, and ioyned with him to make warre againſt vs, which one day they ſhal find to be done againſt themſelues. For I am witneſſe, that you following the better part, haue labored for thē, aboue your ſtrength. Yet we be ouercome, not of the eunimye, but of hunger, and as it were forſaken of our Captains. It ſhould haue become me to haue abiden the vttermoſt for my country: & therby in the ende haue had the prayſe of my good wil: but I can not for you, whoſe ſafetie I preferre before my glory. Therfore I wyll ſend Ambaſſadors to the victour, and I will require him to puniſh me only, and let you go, & that he would giue you y• forgiueneſſe, which I do not aſke for my ſelfe. You being Citizens as he is, & ſometime his ſouldiours, not nowe offending, but hauing a iuſte cauſe of war, be ouercome, not with fight, but with

Lucius hauing pitie of thoſe noble men that were equall in dignitie with the other, praiſed them, and ſaide he woulde ſende other Ambaſſadors to him: and
                                 Lucius goeth to Caeſar.
                               bycauſe he thought none ſo fit as hymſelfe, he woulde go alone without an Heraulte. When it was tolde Caeſar that Lucius was comming to hym, he went ſtraight to méete him, and they bothe came in ſight, accompanied with their friends, in the habite of a General. Then Lucius ſending aſide all hys friends, wente on with two Sergeants, ſignifying what he meant: and Caeſar following

                              If I had made this warre with ſtraungers, I would haue bin aſhamed (O Caeſar) to haue bin ouercome, and more aſhamed to yéelde myſelfe: from the whiche ignominie, I woulde eaſilye haue deliuered my life: But bicauſe I haue dealt with a Citizen of lyke authoritie, and that for my country, I thinke it no

ſhame for ſuch a cauſe to be ouercome of ſuch a manne, which I ſpeake, not that I refuſe to ſuffer any thyng that thou writ put vpon mee, beyng come to this campe, wythout an Herauld, but to aſke pardon for other, iuſte and commedious for thyne eſtate. Whych, that thou mayſte vnderſtande the more playnly, I wyll ſeparate theyr cauſe from mine, that after thou ſhalt vnderſtand that I am the onelye cauſe, thou mayſte exerciſe thine anger vppon me. Thinke not that I will inuey againſte thee licentiouſly, which now were oute of tyme, but wyll onelye tell the truth, which I cannot diſſemble.
                           
                           
                              I tooke thys warre agaynſte thée, not that I woulde bée a Prince, if I hadde diſpatched thée: but that I myghte haue broughte the Common wealth to the rule of the Senate, whyche is nowe taken awaye by the power of thrée, as thou thy ſelfe canſte not denye.
                           
                           
                              For when you begunne it, confeſſyng it vnlawfull, you ſayde it was neceſſarye for a tyme, Caſsius and Brutus beyng alyue, who coulde not be reconciled vnto you. They being taken awaye, the reſte, (if any reſt there be) being afraide of you, and takyng armes, not agaynſte the Common wealth, and youre tyme beeyng ended, I requyred that the oppreſſed Senate myghte be reſtored, not regardyng my brother before my Countrey. For I hoped to haue perſwaded him at his retourne, and I made haſte to doe it in the tyme of myne offyce. If thou wouldeſt haue doone ſo, thou ſhouldeſt haue hadde the glorye alone, but bycauſe I could not perſwade thée, I wente to the Cittye, and thought to gette it by ſtrength and force, being a Senatoure, and a Conſull.
                           
                           
                              Theſe were the onelye cauſes of this warre, not my brother, not Manius, not Fuluia, nor the landes diuided to the Souldyoures, that wanne the fielde at Philippi: not the pitie of the olde poſſeſſioners caſt out of the landes: for by myne authoritie, ſome were appoynted to landes for my brothers

Legions, the olde owners ſpoyled. But thys calumniation thou dyddeſt deuiſe, that thou myghteſt putte the faulte of the warre from thy ſelfe, to me, and the newe inhabiters. And by thys arte, wynnyng the heartes of the olde Souldyoures, thou haſt wanne alſo the victory: for it was perſuaded them, that I woulde putte them out by violence. Theſe deuices were to be vſed, when thou madeſt warre agaynſte me. Nowe béeyng Conqueroure, if thou bée an ennimie of thy Countrey, make mée an enimie alſo, that coulde not remedie it, béeyng lette by famyne. And thys I ſpeake fréelie, gyuing my ſelfe (as I ſayde) into thy handes, ſhewyng what I thought of thée before, and nowe alſo, béeyng with thée alone. Thus much of my ſelfe.
                           
                           
                              Now, as concernyng my friendes, and the whole army: if thou wilte beléeue me, I wyll gyue thée moſt profitable councell. Doe not vſe them hardly for my cauſe, and matter: and ſéeyng thou arte a man, and ſubiect to vnſtable fortune, make not thy friendes the flower to venture, for thée, if they ſhall ſée examples gyuen of thée, nothyng to be hoped, but to the Conqueroures. And if thou reiect all my councell, as of thyne enimie, I maye not bée aſhamed to craue pardon of thée, that thou wouldeſt not exacte puniſhmente of my friendes for my faulte or miſſefortune, but rather turne all vppon mée, whyche am the cauſe of all theſe troubles: for I haue lefte them behynde me of purpoſe, leaſt if I ſhoulde ſpeake theſe things in theyr hearyng, I ſhoulde ſéeme to ſéeke myne owne cauſe. To thys Caeſar aunſwered.
                           
                           
                              When I ſawe thée come to mée withoute an Heraulde, I came apace out of my campe, that thou myghteſt fréelie doe that myghte bée for thy good. And ſéeyng thee acknowledgyng thy faulte, thou commytteſt thy ſelfe to my power, I néede not confute the thyngs whyche thou haſt obiected

But now, ſéeing without any condition thou giueſt thy ſelfe, thy friends and army to vs: al anger is taken awaye, al neceſſitie of truce is cutte off. For nowe I muſte conſider, not ſo much what you haue deſerued, as what is ſeemly for mee to doe, whyche I hadde rather doe, eyther for Gods cauſe, for my cauſe, or for thy ſake (O Lucie): neither will I deceiue

Receyuing the watch worde, they did not leaue the wented watches, for ſo Caeſar commaunded that they ſhould kéepe watche ſeuerally.

When he hadde ſacrificed, he ſate in the Generals ſeate, and commanded euery one to lay down their armour, which beeing done, hée commaunded the old ſouldiors to drawe nighe, that he mighte reproue their vnkindneſſe, and make them afraide, yet his meaning was knowne well ynough.

He ſente thrée others to Stilida in the furdeſt parte of the Sea to abyde occaſion. He commaunded Taurus to goe to mount Silatio, that is a mountaine againſt Tauromino. Whiche hée did, beyng both fitte for the fight, and for the paſſages. The army by land followed, & was ſcouted with light horſemen: the nauy, with Brigandines and Foyſtes. Caeſar came from Vibone and prayſed the order, and returned to Vibo. Pompey placed garriſons on the coaſt of Sicelie, and kept his nauie at Meſsina, to helpe when néede were. To Lepidus came out of Africa the other foure legions, with whom, Papias a Capitayne of Pompeis met, and by a pretence of friendſhip, deſtroyed them. For they thought hée had bene ſente of Lepidus to conduct them and gaue place. Two of y• legions periſhed in the ſea, if any eſcaped by ſwimming, Tiſienus killed them on lande. Caeſar, ſayled from Vibone, into Strongile, one of the Aeolian Ilāds, ſending foyſtes to eſpie the coaſt, and perceyuing many ſhippes aboute Pelorus, Milis, and Tyndaride, he thought Pompey had bene there. Therefore he left Agrippa his Lieftenaunt, and went agayne to Libon. Frō thence he wente againe to Taurus campe with Meſſala and thrée

He had in his company an Aegiptian, after ye maner of a Soothſayer, who, eyther to pleaſe Cleopatra, or to ſhew the very truth, tolde Antonie then, that hys fortune was obſeured by the fortune of Octauius. Therefore hée aduiſed him to go furder off. For, ſayth he, whē thou art abrode, thy nature is noble and coragious, but when thou art with him, it is deiect and afrayde of his. Antonie, whether by this motion, or his owne inclination, was content to leaue all there to Octauius, and to go towarde his olde loue of Aegipt, yet carying his new wife with him into Graecia, pretending an earneſt deſire to reuenge the iniurie that was done to Craſſus, which was after this ſorte:

And the Kyng feared, that if his men ſhoulde lye in the fielde all Winter, they would forſake him. Wherefore he deuiſed this policie. The noble men of the Parthians ſuffered the Romanes to carrie awayeCraſt of the Parthians.

When Antony hearde of this, he cauſed to be enquired, whether theſe men dyd ſpeake by the Kings conſent, which they aunſwered to be. Then he ſente to the King, that if he woulde reſtore the Captiues and enſignes, he would depart. The King ſayd, he would ſende them to him, if he would depart quickly. Therefore Antony made vp, and retired. At his going away, he did not ſpeake to the Souldyoures as he was wont to doe, being very elaquente that way, whereat many were offended, committing the matter to be done

Being in his way, one Mardus, well acquainted with the Parthian maners, whoſe faith the Romanes had proued before, tolde Antony it was beſt for him to goe ſo, as hée might haue the hilles on his right hande, and not to hazarde hys army laden with armour to the Parthian archers and horſemen in the playne way. Antony conſulted with his counſell, pretending yet not to be afrayde of the breache of peace, and accepting

the counſell as compendious. Antony required ſuretie of Mardw, he had him bind him, till he came into Armenia. So béeyng bound, he brought him two dayes quietly.

Therefore he wiſhed Antony to loke to it, for they were not faire off. Antony ſette his men in order, and by and by the Parthians came vppon him, whome he receyued with his ſhotte. So there was muche hurte done on both ſides, till the French horſemen brake vpon them, and put them by for that day. Antony being taughte hereby, went on with a ſquare battel, fencing the ſame thoroughly with the ſhotte. The Horſemen were commaunded to gyue repulſe to the enimie, and that done, not to cha

He tolde him that Moneſis, for good will to Antony, had ſent him to ſhew, that vnder the hilles which he ſaw before him, nexte vnto the which the playne way did ioyne, the Parthians lay in ſecrete, to beguile him againe by their faire words. Therfore if he woulde ſaue himſelfe and his hoſt, he ſhoulde not leaue the way by the hilles, where in déede he ſhoulde finde laboure and thirſt, but the other way he ſhould not eſcape Craſſus miſfortune. This ſaide, he went his way. Antony communicated this wyth his friendes, and with Mardus, who affirmed it to be moſt lyke the truth. Therefore he ſayd it was beſt to go by the hils, though it were paynefull, and ſhoulde lacke water one daye.

So they were compelled both to march, and to reſiſt the enimie. Now was the foreward come to a floud, whiche was very cléere, but ſalt, that whoSalt vvater. ſoeuer dranke of it, was full of payne.

In this parte hee ſheweth the conqueſtes that they made of other nations: vvherein they vvente ſo farre, that at laſte they fell dovvne, beeyng ouerpreſte vvith their ovvne vvayght. To theſe tvvo kindes of conqueſts, a thirde is to be added, vvhen a man conquereth himſelfe, as Alexander did in conteyning from Darius moſt faire vvife and daughters, and Caeſar, in ſparing to puniſh his greateſt enimies. To vvhom Cicero ſay de, that in other victories, fortune, policie, and ſouldiours, might claime a parte, but in this, he alone ſhould haue al the glorie. And vvhen Darius died, and vvas holpen therto, by Polycrates, he ſayd, for thy paines Alexander ſhal giue thee thanks, but the Gods immortal, ſhal giue Alexander

By ſuch maner of conqueſt, your honour ſhall attaine to moſte ſure triumphe, the guide of vvhoſe Chariot, ſhal be Grace giuen from aboue, that ſhal neuer fayle you. Hovv vvorthy this author is to be read inStephanus in his Greeke addition to the Greeke Preface. theſe matters, his teſtimonie may be ynough to proue, that vviſheth him to be read in the ſame, afore all other. Then may it pleaſe your Honour to accept him at the hands of your moſt humble ſeruaunt, that cōtinually prayeth for your increaſe of fame and honour, to the ſeruice of your Prince, and the glorie of God.

                     BEginning to write the Hiſtorie of the Romaines, I haue thought it neceſſary to declare fyrſt, the borders of the nations that the Romanes ruled. In the mayne Sea, the moſte parte of the Brittaines is theirs. And goyng to the ſea, by the pillers of Hercules, and ſayling aboute theſe pillers, they beeTheſe pillers or hylls of Hercules be in the ſtraightes of Gades, beyōd the vvhiche it vvas thoughe no mā could go.

The order of the whiche, is after the order of the time in the which they were done, though that many other things happened by the way.

And generally, he lefte nothing vndene or vndeutied that coulde be done, to ſtirre vp the greateſt motion among all men, from the Eaſt to the Weaſt. For either they made warre, or ſent ayde, or robbed or vexed their neyghbours. This warre was variable, and in the end brought the Romanes to greateſt dominions, for by this, their rule ſtretched from the Weſt, to the floud Euphrates. It was not eaſie for me to deuide it by ſeuerall nations, being done togither, and one wrapped with another. Thoſe that could be ſeparated, be told particularly.

He aunſwered, he would ſhortly giue him all Attalus Kingdome, for whoſe ſake he had inuaded Aſia before. When he had ſaid thus, he ſente to Rome to accuſe Attalus and Nicomedes, and to call them into iudgement: but Attalus wente with his armie into Bithinia, to

                           Pelopidas came agayne to the Romanes audience, once more accuſing Nicomedes of the things that were done of old, and prayd the Romanes to be Judge. Theſe things that now be done (ſayde he) he hath done in your ſight. Mithridates Kingdome he hathe diminiſhed, the Sea he hath ſhutte, ſpoyles he hathe carryed away. This néedeth no debating or conſultation, but we once agayne pray you, eyther to correct that is done, or to help Mithridates do that, that hath ſuffered the wrong, or laſtly (O Romanes) not to forbidde hym to reuenge himſelfe, but let them two trye it out. This aunſwered Pelopidas.
                        
                     
                     It was certayne that the Romanes fauoured Nicomedes, and for a faſhion heard their controuerſies: but ſomewhat they were moued at the wordes of Pelopidas. 
                        And bycauſe Mithridates was yet in league with the Romanes, and ſtoode in doubt what to aunſwere preſently, and hauing with wiſedome conſidered the matter, they aunſwered thus. Neyther will we haue Mithridates
                           The Romanes aunſvvere. ſuffer any thing wrongfully of Nicomedes, neyther ſuffer warre to be made vpon Nicomedes, for we thinke it not good for the Romanes, that Nicomedes ſhould be hurt. When they had thus ſayde, and Pelopidas woulde haue made aunſwere to their ſentence ſo doubtfull, they wente from the ſeate. When Mithridates ſawe that he was manifeſtly iniured of the Romanes, he ſent his ſonne Ariarathes with a great army, to reigne in Cappadocia, and he expelled Ariobarzanes, and had the kingdome. Pelopidas commyng agayne to the Romane officers, ſaid thus:
                     
                        What Mithridates hath borne at your hāds (O Romanes) being ſpoiled of Phrygia and Cappadocia, you haue heard. What hurt Nicomedes hath done him, you ſée, & let it paſſe, we appealing to your amitie and leage. And as though we were the accuſers, and not accuſed, you aunſwere, that you thinke it not profitable for the Romane ſtate, that Nicomedes ſhoulde be hurte, as though he were iniured. You (O Romanes) are the cauſe that things be done in Cappadocia, againſte the ſtate of Rome. For thorough youre contempt

of vs, and your ſubtill aunſweres, Mithridates hathe done thys, and now he ſendeth Embaſſadoures againſte you to youre Senate, to whome he ſendeth you worde to aunſwere: and that you attempt nor begin any thing to kindle this warre, withoute the common conſent of the Romanes.

The fugitiues tolde him, there was a ſide of an hill that might be ſcaled, where the Temple of Iupiter Tabyrius was, with a weake wall. He put his army in the ſhips by night, to other he gaue ſcaling ladders: He commaunded both to goe with ſilence, till a fire was made from the Temple, and then with a crye as loude as coulde bee made, ſome to aſſaulte the towne, and ſome to force the Porte, and they with ſilence drewe nighe.

The Rhodians defended themſelues manfully, till the engine brake for waight, and a viſion of Iſis was thought to caſte a greate fire vpon it. Mithridates deſpairing

of this enterpriſe, ſayled from the Rhodes.
                     
                     Being at Patara at ſiege, he cut down the holy woode of Latone

                         to make engins, till he was feared with a viſion: then he left the woode. Leauing Pelopida to continue the warre in Lycia, hée ſente Archilous into Grecia, to winne it by force or friendſhip ſo much as was poſſible, and committing many things to his Captains, he trayned and furniſhed his army, and paſſed the time with his woman of Stratonicede: He ſate in iudgement of them that were thought to watch him, or make any mutinie, or helpe the Romaines. And whiles hée was thus occupied, theſe thinges were done in Grecia. Archelous ſayling with a great nauie well victualled, he tooke Delos that was reuolted from Athens and other places, by violence and power, killing twenty thouſande men, of the whiche the moſte were Italians, the places he appointed to the Athenians, by the whyche, and by other meane they extolling Mithridates, and greatly prayſing hym, he brought them and other to his friendſhip. He ſent the holy money of Delos to them

And not he alone in Athens, nor Critias that was before him, and they beyng profeſſours of Philoſophie with Critias, were tyrannes, but in Italy they of Pythagoras ſchoole, and in the other Grecia, they that were called the ſeauen Wiſe men, when they had rule, theyPhiloſophers Tirannes. tooke vpon them and vſed tyranny more cruellye, than y• vnlearned tyrannes. Therefore there is a doubt and ſuſpition of other Philoſophers, whether for vertue, or for pouertie, or for lacke of experience, they comforted themſelues with Philoſophie: Of the whiche now, many being priuate & poore, & couering néede by ſapiēce, they ſpeake bitterly againſte rich men and Princes, not for cōtempt of riches, and rule in their opinion, but rather for enuy being caried there vnto. But they that bée ſlaundered of them, do more wiſely contempne them. This one maye thinke to bée ſpoken of Aristion the Philoſopher, as by occaſion of matter

                     Thys béeyng often done, and come to knowledge, Sylla hauyng regarde to the matter, founde it thus written, To morrowe, the footemen ſhall come vppon the face of youre labourers, and the Horſemen ſhall ſette vppon the ſydes of the Romanes. Therefore he layde an ambuſh ready, and when the enimie had thought to haue come ou y• ſuddayne, he more ſuddaynelye dyd ſette vppon them, kylled many of them, and droue the other into the Sea. And thys was the ende of thys attempte.

He ſente for more power out of Chalcidonia, and other Ilandes, and armed hys mariners, as he that woulde hazarde all, Archelous hadde a greater armye than Sylla, and nowe it was muche bigger. At midnighte he iſſued wyth lyghtes, and burned one of the greate engines, with all that belonged to it, Sylla in tenne dayes made another, and ſette it where the other was, and Archelous erected a Tower agaynſt them on the wall.

In the meane ſeaſon Mynio and Philotimus of Smyrna, and Clisthenes, and Aſclepiodotus, Leſbians, alA conſpiracte bevvrayed. fréendes to the king, and Aſclepiodotus, ſometime captayne of the ſtraungers, did make a conſpiracie againſt Mithridates. Of the which Aſclepiodotus was the bewraier: & for the more credite, he brought to paſſe, that the kyng, vnder a bedde, hearde what Mynio ſayde. The cōſpiracie being bewrayed, they were cruelly killed. The like ſuſpition was vpon many moe. The Pergameneans doyng the like foure ſcore of them were takē, and other, in other cities, Mithridates ſending ſearchers to euery place, who finding out his enimies, killed a thouſād ſixe hundred men, the accuſers of the which, not lōg after, were ſoone puniſhed of Sylla, ſome killed themſelf, & ſome fled to Mithridates into Pontus. Now had Mithridates gathered an army of .lxxx. M. the which Dorilus did leade into Grecia to Archelous that had .x. M. left. Syllas had his army
                           Orchomenus at the floud of that name. nigh to Archelous at Orchomeno, & when he ſaw ſo great a nūber of horſemen, he digged many pittes in the plaine, x. foote broade. And had his army in order to receyue Archelaus. And when the Romanes did fayntly come to y• fight for the multitude of horſemē, he rode about, & exhorted them, & beſide threatned thē. But whē he could not ſo bring them to the matter, he lept of his horſe and tooke the Enſigne & ranne to the enimies with his garde, crying:The boldneſſe of Sylla.

And when the victory began to appeare, he mounted on horſe agayne,The victory of the Romane

There dyed of the enimes aboute fiftéene thouſande, whereof the moſt part were horſemen, & among them Diogenes, that was Archelous ſon. The footemen fledde to the Campe, and Sylla fearing leaſt Archelous woulde flée againe to Thalcida, he hauing no Shippes, all that night he ſet watches in y• playne, and in the day, not fully a furlong frō 
                        Archelous, he caſt a trench (he not comming forth,) & exhorted earneſtly his army to finiſh the reſt of al this battel, ſeing their enimies durſt not come out, and brought them to the trēch of Archelous. The like mutation was among the enimies, for neceſſitie the Captaynes running aboute, ſhewing the preſente daunger, and rebuking them, if they woulde not defende theyr Camp againſt their enimies that were fewer than they. Force and crye being made on eyther ſide, there was great might ſhewed on both parts. The Romanes couering themſelues with their ſhields, did now digge downe a corner of the Campe, but the defendours put them backe with their ſhorte weapons, and none durſt enter, till Baſillus the Captayne of that legion firſte lept in,The valiantnes of Baſillus.

And Archelous was hidde in a Fenne, where getting boates, he ſayled to Chalcida, and gathered togither all the reſt of the Kings army with diligence.This garland or crovvne vvas called Vallaris, vvhich vvas giuen to him that firſt ſcaled the trench.

Flaccus being vnexpert in the warres, a man of the Senate, of good will, and beloued of the army, named Fimbria, wente with him.

Sylla ceaſſing a while, ſayd, Archeloe, if Mithridates doe deliuer vnto me all the Nauie which thou haſt, and deliuer our Captaines, Embaſſadours, priſoners, fugitiues, and ſlaues fledde frō vs, and let go the Chians beſide forth, and all other that he hath made Captiues in Pontus, and take his garriſons from euery place, except thoſe which he had before the breaking of peace, and defray the charges of the warre whereof he hathe bin the cauſe, and conteyne himſelfe within the limits of his fathers dominions, I truſt to perſuade that the Romanes will no more remember what he hathe done.

                         (O Romanes) are you moſt to be blamed, bycauſe you will be corrupt with money. The warre being broken by youre Generalles, what ſoeuer I haue done in defence, it hathe bin rather of neceſſitie, than of will. When Mithridates had ſayde thus, hee ceaſſed. Sylla thus aunſwered. Although thy comming is for peace, and yet doeſt renue other matter, I will not refuſe to ſpeake briefely of it. When I was lieutenant of Cilicia, I ſette Ariobarzanes into Cappadocia, by decrée of the Romanes, and thou diddeſt obey. Thou ſhouldeſt then haue ſpoken againſt it, and not wrangled afterwarde, or ſwarued from the order. Manius

The iniuſtice is indifferente to you both, and by this thou doeſt confeſſe, that thou gotteſt it vnlawfully, by giuing of money. Manius, both in this, and other things done for money, was reproued of vs, and the Senate diſſolued all that he had done, by reaſon whereof, they woulde not make Phrygia tributarie vnto them, béeyng gyuen vniuſtly to thée, but lefte it frée. Then by what reaſon doeſt thou vſurpe the things that we haue taken by warre, and wyll not yet haue thée to rule? Nicomedes accuſeth thée and Alexander for woundyng hys bodye, ſendyng Socrates Chreſtus into his Kyngdome. He to reuenge this, inuaded thy Realme. If he dyd thée wrong, thou ſhouldeſt haue ſente Embaſſadoures, and haue tarried for aunſwere. If thou dyddeſt make ſpéedy reuengeance on Nicomedes, why dyddeſt thou inuade Ariobarzanes that hadde

done thée no wrong, for when thou hadſt begunne with him, the Romanes were compelled by their couenantes to reſtore hym, and béeyng reſtored, to defend him. Thou madeſt warre, béeyng thus perſuaded, and in hope, that if thou didſt ouercome the Romanes, thou ſhouldeſt reigne ouer all, making theſe pretences of thy purpoſe, of the whyche we haue thys coniecture, that before there was any warre, thou madeſt league wyth the Thracians, Scythians, and Sauromatians, and ſendeſt to the Kings thy neyboures. Thou madeſt Shippes, and gatheredſt maiſters and mates, and the time doth bewray thyne intente. For when thou hardeſt that Italy was reuolted frō vs, wayting for our trouble, thou didſt inuade Ariobarzanes, Nicomedes, the Galatians, and Paphlagonia. Thou dydſt inuade Aſia our lande, and when thou hadſt got it, what didſt thou againſt the Cities, ouer which thou madeſt ſlaues and fellowes in debt, rulers, by giuing of libertie, and releaſſing of debt? and agaynſt the Grecians, of whom, for a ſmall occaſion, thou didſt kill ſixetéene hundreth? or the princes of Galatia, whome being at a feaſt with thée, thou didſt murther? And the Italian nation, in one daye thou didſt kill and drowne, with their wiues and childrē, not ſparing them that were fledde into the holy places. Howe greate crueltie, how great impietie and extremitie of hate, didſt thou ſhow agaynſte vs, gathering euery mans mony? Thou didſt ſayle into Europe with greate armyes, we forbiddyng all Kyngs of Aſia, to enter into Europe. When thou wert come, thou didſt ouercome Macedonia oure prouince. Thou tokeſt from the Grecians theyr fréedome. Neyther didſt thou repente thée, or make Archelous the meane for thée, tyll I hadde recouered Macedonia, and delyuered Grecia from thy violence, and ſlayne a hundreth and ſixtie thouſand of thyne army, and taken thy Campes with theyr munition. Therfore I maruell now thou doeſt iuſtifye thy ſelfe in thoſe thyngs, which thou deſireſt to be forgyuen by Archelous, whyche I being farre off, thou didſt graunte, but being nigh, thou doeſt call into queſtion whoſe tyme is paſt, thou making warre, and we reſiſting mightily, and will reſiſt thée to the ende.
                     
                     
                        Sylla ſpeaking this with anger, the King was afrayde, and

graunted and confyrmed the conditions made by Archelous, and deliueryng the Shyppes, and all other things, he went into Pontus his fathers Kingdome onely. Thus the firſte warre betwéene the Romanes and Mithridates ceaſſed.

He anſwered, if thou art a friend to Lucullus, I will giue thée very great thanke, if thou béeſt his enimie, I will not deliber of it. Thus aunſwered Pompeyus, and the Barbarians woulde haue had the King to haue killed him. The King ſayd, he would not hurte vertue that was deſtitute of Fortune: Preparing continually to fight, and Lucullus refuſing it, he ſought a way to come vpon him on the hill. There was a certaine Scythian, named Olcabas, that hadde bin a long fugitiue with Lucullus, and bycauſe he hadde ſaued many at the fight of horſemen, hée was admitted to Lucullus table, and priuie to his counſell and ſecretes.

Theſe being diuided into bands and companies after the Italian diſcipline, he tooke them to be trayned of his men of Pontus. Lucullus comming towarde them, Mithridates helde all his footemen, and halfe his horſemen vpon an hill. The reſte of the horſemen Tigranes ledde, and méeting wyth the Romaine foragers, was ouercome: after the whiche the Romanes foraged more ſafely, euen in the places next Mithridates, and encamped there.

For Italy being rebelled, & they moleſted, & the ſea being full of théeues, & they with famine oppreſſed, they did not thinke it good for them to take another ſo great a warre in hande, till they were deliuered of thoſe incommodities.

For they y• had loſte their liuyngs and countries thorow the war, and were fallen into extreame pouertie, left the land, & ſought commoditie by y• ſea: and firſt with brigandines & foiſts, then with little galleys they roued, the Archpirats being their leaders as generals of an army, vnwalled Citties they ſpoiled, them that were walled,The myshappes of the Rouers. they vndermined or beate downe, or got by ſiege & deſtroyed.

                     The Carthagies being prouoked to fight, of Syphax kyng of Numidia, they called home Aſdrubal wt part of his armye, wherby the Scipios did eaſily gette the reſte of Spaine, and mayne Citties yéelded fréely. For they were apte to gouerne armyes, and alſo by perſuaſion, to winne Cities to their obedience. The Carthagies, compounding with Syphax, ſente Aſdruball into Spaine wyth more menne, and wyth thyrtye Elephantes, adioyning other two Captaines to them, that is, Mago and Aſdrubal, Gyſgons ſonnes.
                     After that tyme, the Scipios had ſharpe warre, and yet were ſuperiors, of the whiche, manye ſouldiours of the Carthagies and Elephants were conſumed, till the winter beyng come, the Carthagies

Cneus Scipio, not knowing the chaunce of hys brother, ſent hys ſouldiors to fetche artillerie, wyth whom

Whiche Cneus vnderſtanding, came foorth in haſte with the light harneſſed to helpe hys men, wherof the former being killed and putte backe, Scipio was driuen into a Tower, the whiche they ſette a fyre, and burned hym and hys companye. Thus the two Scipios were killed, men certainly of great worthineſſe & greatly loued and lamented of the Spaniards, that had committed themſelues for their ſakes, to the Romaine obedience.
                     When this was knowen at Rome, the Romanes tooke it very grieuouſly, and ſent Marcellus, which a little before was come out of Sicilie, and with him Claudius, wyth a nauy and ten thouſande footemen, two thouſand horſemen, and mony and victuall ſufficient to make warre in Spaine. Of the whiche, no notable thing being done, the Carthagies encreaſed very much, for nowe they had wellnigh gotten all Spaine, the Romaynes béeing dryuen into a little ſtreight, ſo as they were caſte to the Pyrene hils.
                     The whiche when they at Rome hearde, they were more grieued and afraide, leaſt, whiles Anniball waſted thoſe Regions, whiche were at the ſides of Italie, the other army ſhoulde inuade another way: therfore thoughe they woulde neuer ſo muche, they coulde not leaue Spaine, fearing the warre of Spaine woulde ſtretch to Italy. Therefore they appointed a day to determine a Generall for the war in Spaine.

But Viriatus that had eſcaped from Galbas crueltie, andThe policie and hardineſſe of Viriatus.
                         was then with them, put them in remembrance of the Romanes falſehoode, and tolde them how oft they hadde bin deceyued by colour of promiſe, and that all the Romanes army was nowe lyke vnto the deceytefulneſſe of Galba and Lucullus: but if they woulde be ruled by hym, he woulde tell them how they might all eſcape ſafe. They béeyng moued with hys wordes, and conceyuing good hope, choſe hym theyr Captayne. Therefore when he hadde placed all the horſe in the front of the battell, as though he woulde fyghte, he commaunded the other, ſo ſoone as he tooke hys horſe, to diuide themſelues, and by diuers pathes to flée ouer the hylles, as well as they could, to Tribola, andTribola. there to tarry hym tyll he came.

And when by coniecture, he thoughte them that were gone, to be come to a ſure place, at midnighte wyth moſt ſpéede, by dyuers hard wayes, he got to Tribola. The Romanes coulde not ouertake hym, partly for the weight of their armoure, partly for the ignorance of the way, and partly for the diuerſitie of theyr Horſes. Thus Viriatus ſaued hys men that were in deſperation of themſelues. Thys policie wanne hym greate fame ouer all the places aboute, and ſo they came vnto hym in great numbers.
                     He kepte warre wyth the Romanes thrée yeares togither, and it is well knowen, that this warre muche troubled the ſame,

and in the ende, was very daungerous vnto them. And if there were any other ſtirre in Spayne, that was the cauſe that it continued the longer. Vettilius followed, and came to Tribola. Viriatus layde an ambuſhe in an hyll, whyther when he knewe thatTraynes on the Romanes.

They that be hard and ſeuere, haue their ſouldyoures ready and obediente at all aſſayes: the whiche though he has thus inſtructed, yet he durſt not bring them into the fielde, till he had exerciſed them with much labour. Therefore going dayly by one field or another, he made diuers Campes, one after another, whiche being defaced, he called the Souldyoures to worke agayne, to digge the ditches higher, and to fill them againe, to make high walles, and to pull them downe againe, and he ſtode from morning till night to ouerſee the pioners. When he made any iourney, he went with a ſquare battell, that it ſhoulde not be ſcattered by any ſuddaine attempte, as had happened to other. He rode about the army, and ſometime to the hindermoſt, and bad the ſicke ſhould be borne on the horſemens horſes.

Neither did he encounter with the enimie, waying the nature and end of warre, and the ſtrength of the Numantines, leaſt they would come vpon him with all their force. Therfore he commaunded to waſt all things the corne to be cutte whileſt it was gréene, which being waſted, he muſt néedes goe further. The way that went to Numantia, by the playne, was ſhorter, and many perſuaded him to

go that way, to whome Scipio ſayd, he conſidered the way to returne,Hard vvay ſure: for the enimie was full of ſhotte, to come out to the ſight, and had the Citie at their backe, to returne ſafely againe. But we (ſaid he) being laden with victual and wéery, ſhould be farre too weake for them.

four and twenty furlongs. The encloſure was as muche, orThree myles. more, and all that was diſtributed to the Tribunes, whiche, if they were let of the enimie, they ſhould ſignifie it by day, with a redde cloth vpon a ſpeare, and in the night, by a fire, that he and his brother might aide thē that were circumuented, whiche béeing done, and they that were ſet for gard, were ſufficient to reſiſt the enimie. He commaunded another beſide that to be made, and to plant ſtakes about it, or next them, to build a newe wall, the breadth of the which was fiue foote, and the height, tenne, beſide the pinnacles and towers diſtant by equall ſpace.

Yet he did maruell that they would require him to leaue Cities in Ionia, and loſe his tributes, and not to deale with certain of Aſia, and to forgo Thracia, that had euer bin hys progenitors, whiche were things, not for friendes, but for conquerours to commaunde to the conquered. The Senate perceyuing their comming to be but an eſpiall, ſhortelye aunſwered: If Antiochus do ſuffer the Gréeke Citties in Aſia to be frée, and refraine from Europe, he ſhall be a friende to the Romanes
                        The anſvvere of the Romanes if he will. Thus the Romanes anſwered, and made none other ſhewe of cauſe.
                     
                        Antiochus minding firſte to inuade Grecia, and there to begin the warre againſte the Romanes, aſked Annibals opinion in theThe opinion of Anniball touching the vvarre. matter. He ſaide, that Grecia was eaſy to be ouercome, bycauſe of their long affliction. The war that is made at home, is moſte grieuous for dearth that followeth of it, but abroade it is more tollerable: neither ſhould he ouercome the Romanes in Grecia, ſéeing they myght haue ſufficient prouiſion and helpe from home. Therefore his opinion was, he ſhould inuade the Romanes in Italy, whether, if he went, he ſhoulde fynd the Romanes weaker, both at home and abroade. I haue, ſaide he, experience of Italy, and with .x. M. men I can take fitte places of it, and I will write to my friends at Carthage, to ſtir the people to reuolte, being ſory for me, & angry with the Romanes, & being full of hope, & hart, wyll thinke I will once againe get Italy.
                     
                     The king hearing this aduice very well, and thinking the acceſſe of Carthage to make muche for the furtheraunce of thys warre, badde hym ſend

in wayte euery where, and the war not being yet proclaymed, and many being in diſcord at Carthage, and the common wealth hauing no firmeneſſe nor certentie, which ſhortly after was the deſtruction of Carthage. Yet he ſent Ariſton a merchant of Tyrus, vnder pretence of marchandiſe, to his friendes, exhorting
                           Anniball ſendeth Ariſton to practice at Carthage.
                         them, that when they vnderſtoode that he inuaded Italy, they ſhould ſtirre the people of Carthage to be reuenged. Ariſton did ſo, but when Annibals enimies perceyued Ariſtons purpoſe, they made much adoe, that any innouation ſhoulde followe, and diligently ſought for Ariſton. He, that the friendes of Anniball ſhould not beare all the blame, ſecretely in the night, ſette vp aThe deuice of Ariſton to ſaue Annibals friends. writing at the common houſe, in the whiche Anniball exhorted all the Senate to reuenge their Countrey vnder Antiochus, and when he had ſo done, he ſayled away. When daye was come, all the ſuſpition was taken from Annibals friends, bycauſe the matter belonged to all the ſtate. The people was ful of vprore, angry with the Romanes, but not able to hurte them. And thus went the matters at Carthage.

This they did, to make Anniball ſuſpected to the king as they did in déede, by their ofte reſorting

                        Scipio aſked him, whome he thoughte to be the beſt Captayne, he anſwered, Alexander of Macedonia. Scipio ſtayed at that, and gaue place to Alexander. Then he aſked him, whome hée thought the ſecond next Alexander, he ſayde Pirrhus of Epirota, putting the vertue of a Captayne in boldeneſſe, for there can not be found a more couragious Kyng, than hée. Scipio now was gréeued, and againe aſked him whome he thoughte to bée the thirde, thinking verily he woulde haue named him: he aunſwered my ſelfe, for béeing a yong man, I ſubdued Spayne, and with mine armie paſſed the Alpes into Italy, the firſte after Hercules that ſo haue done. I inuaded it, when none of you durſt doe any thyng. I ouerthrewe foure hundred Townes, and broughte youre Citie many times into daunger, hauing neyther money nor men ſent me out of Carthage. When Scipio perceyued he dyd ſo of purpoſe aduance himſelfe, he ſmyled and ſayde, in what place wouldeſt thou haue put thy ſelfe (O. Anniball) if thou hadſt not bin ouercome of me. He perceyuing this emulation, ſayde, I woulde haue ſet my ſelfe before Alexander. So dyd Anniball continue in his lofty talke, and yet ſecretely pleaſe Scipio, as making hym better than Alexander.
                     
                     Thys talke being ended, Anniball deſired Scipio to hys lodging, Scipio ſayde he woulde come very gladly, but that it ſhould cauſe ſuſpition betwéene Antiachus and the Romanes. Thus theſe noble Captaynes ended theyr malice, when the warreMalice endeth in ſome, vvhen watter ceſſeth. was ended, but ſo dyd not Flaminius. For when Antiochus was ouercome, and Anniball fledde, and ſauing himſelfe in Bithinia, he being ſente Embaſſadour for other purpoſe to Pruſia, not being iniured by Anniball, nor commaunded of the Romanes, nor to be feared, bycauſe the power of Carthage was abated, kylled him with poyſon by Pruſias conſente, of the whyche it is ſayde, hée was warned before by an Oracle after thys ſort.

                        Aminander Kyng of the Athamanes came into league with Antiochus by this occaſion.
                     One Alexander of Maecedonia, béeing brought vp in Megalopoli, and made frée of that common wealth, fayned himſelfe to come of Alexander, ſonne to Philip: and to gyue credite to hys deuice, he named hys children Philip and Alexander, and Apamea, whome he married to Amynander. Philip hir brother going with hir to the marriage, and perceyuing that Amynander was a weake man, and of little experience, remayned wyth hys brother in lawe to gouerne the Kyngdome.
                     
                        This Philip Antiochus promiſed to reſtore the kingdome of Macedony as his owne, and by this meane, had the Athamaneans his confederates. He had alſo the Thebanes, and wente to Thebes to ſpeake to the people. Thus he very raſhly, in ſo great a war, put his truſt in the Aetolians, Thebanes, and Amynāder. Then he conſulted, whether it were better to inuade Theſſaly out of hand, or to tarrie till Winter were paſt.
                     
                        Anniball being at this conſultation, and ſaying nothing, the king cōmaunded him to ſay his opinion firſt, and thus he ſpake.
                     
                        Thou mayeſt eaſilie ouercome the Theſſalians, eyther now, or

We be come with our owne power, giuing credite to the Aetolians perſuaſion, that the Lacedemonians and Philip will take our part, of the which, the Lacedemonians be our Enimies, as I heare, and ſo be the Acheans. As for Philip, I can not ſée, that he can be any great ayde vnto thée in this warre, being on thy ſide, nor make any great power whatſoeuer part he taketh: but this is mine aduiſe, that thou ſendeſt for thine army with all ſpeede into Aſia, and not put thy truſt in Amynāder, or the Aetolians: when the army is come, to ſend it into Italy, that béeing occupyed with troubles at home, they may leaue them vntouched, and being afraide of themſelues, may not vexe other men. And now, that manner is not to be held of vs, that I ſpake of afore; for we muſt vſe the one halfe of oure na

If he will not bée broughte in, thou ſhalt ſende thy ſonne Seleucus into Thracia, and moleſt him with euils at home, that he be not profitable to thine enimies abroade.
                     
                     Thus Anniball ſaid, and it was the beſt of all, but for enuie of his fame and wiſedome, as well other, as the king himſelfe,

that Anniball ſhoulde not ſéeme to paſſe them all in the arte of warre, nor he haue the prayſe of that ſhoulde be done. All hys counſell was reiected, ſauing that Polyxenides was ſent into Aſia

                     When the Romanes hearde of the entring of Antiochus into Grecia, and of the killing and taking of the Romanes at Delus, they determined warre. Thus Antiochus and the Romanes warreThe vvarre beginneth. growing long before of ſuſpition one of another, did now firſte breake out in déede. And bycauſe Antiochus had the rule of many nations in high Aſia, and of all that inhabite the ſea coaſt, ſauing a fewe, and for that he was entred Europa, and hadde a dreadfull name, and a greate preparation, and otherwiſe hadde done many notable things, by the which he had gotten y• name of Greate, the Romanes thoughte this warre would be daungerous, and of long continuance. They had Philip of Macedome in ſuſpition, being ouercome of them not long before. And in the league with the Cartheginians, they had no great truſt, Anniball being with Antiochus. And of their other ſubiects, they had ſome dōubt, leaſt the glory of Antiochus ſhould make them ſéeke new attemptes. Therefore they ſen

                         ſhewe. And as in a greate feare, carefull for Italy, leaſt ſome diſturbance mighte happen to them, eyther by the violence, or fauour of Antiochus, they ſente a greate bande of footemen to Tarento, there to bée ready at all aſſayes, and a Nauie ſayled ouer all the coaſt. So great a feare of Antiochus was at the firſt.
                     When they hadde thus at home giuen order in all things at the begynning, they gathered theyr army againſte Antiochus. Of themſelues, they hadde twenty thouſand, of theyr confederates twice ſo many, with the whyche, they woulde paſſe into Ionia. And in thys preparation they ſpente the whole Winter.

Therefore he gathered togither the archers and dariers, and other lighte harneſſe, commaunding them to goe againſte the Chariots, and to ſhoote agaynſte the Horſes, and not the men, for the horſe in the Chariot ſtriuing with hys yoke, the reſt of the Chariot is made vnprofitable, and many times breaketh the other battels, men being afrayne of the ſithes, as it came then to paſſe. For when the Horſes were ſtricken ſo thicke, and the Chariots carried backe of the horſes, the Camels felte the diſorder firſt, being next the Cartes, and after them the men of armes, whoſe horſe for the waighte of the armoure,The Chariots vvere armed vvith

Great was the trouble, and the confuſion diuers, which beganne chiefly of theſe, and wēt through the whole battell, and for ignorāce, was more than it néeded. For in a long rowe and thicke multitude of men, with a diuers crie, and greate feare, the truth was not perceyued of them that were next the hurt perſons, and ſuſpition made euery man thinke the thing greater than it was.
                     When Eumenes did ſée the firſte ſuccéede happily to him, and the fore-ward, with the Chariots, that the Camels did couer, to be naked, he ſet his owne horſemen, and as many as he had of the Romanes and Italians againſt the contrary part of the Galatians and Cappadocians, and the other route of ſtrangers, exhorting thē with loude voice to diſpatch theſe ignorant men, being deſtitute of their defence.

The great battell of the Macedonians being ſette with the Horſemen in a ſtreight place and guadrate, and voyde of Horſemen on eyther ſide, receyued the ſkirmiſhers that fought at the front of them, diuiding themſelues, and cloſing againe. Domitius with his Horſemen, and lighte harneſſe,

eaſilie compaſſed them, as a thicke ſquare, neither fitte to gyue onſet, nor enlarge themſelues being ſo broad. They manfully abode much force, and were greeued, that for all their experiēce they could do no good, but ſtand to receyue the ſtripes & wounds of their enimies on euery ſide. Only they ſtretched forthe their pikes in ſquare manner, and chalenged the Romanes to trie their manhoode hand to hande with them, for the which they hadde ſo much prayſe: yet did they not march forth, being on fote & heauie harneſſed, and ſeing their enimies with horſe, chiefly that they ſhould not diſſolue their ſure aray. The Romanes came not vpon them, nor woulde fight with them, fearing the experience and ſtrength of ſo valiant men, but running aboute them, dyd ſhoote and dart at them, and neuer miſſed, ſo many being cloſed in ſo little roome, for neyther could they auoyde the dartes, nor approch to them that threw vpon them. Wherefore when they had endured a long time, of very neceſſitie they gaue backe, and turned their way with threats, very orderly, and fearefull to the Romanes, for neither then durſt they ſette vpon them, but hurte them as they could go about them, till the Elephants brake vppon the Macedonians battell, whiche woulde not be ruled byThe mayne battell is difordred by the Elephants. their guides, and then there orderly retiring, was altered. In this, Domitius had the vpper hand, and paſſing to the Campe of Antiochus, forced them that kepte it. Antiochus chaced the

                           Antiochus chacern one part of the Romanes to their Camp. where the Captaine that had the charge with freſh Souldiours reſiſted his violence, and to them ioyned they that 
                           •
                        edde, and were the more bolder. So the king returned, being very proude and haulte for this victorie, nothing knowing yet of that was happened on the other ſide. Attalus brother to Eumenes, wyth many Horſemen encountred with the king, through the whiche he paſſed, and hurte them, kéeping his courſe with the loſſe of a few, not caring for them. But when he did ſée the loſſe, and all the field full of his dead people, men, horſe, and Elephants, and his Camp taken by force, he fledde without ceaſſing, in he came

to Sardeis, aboute midnight, and from Sardeis, to Celaena, whycheCelaena. they call Apamea, whither hée vnderſtoode hys ſonne was fledde.
                     The next daye he went from Celaena to Syria, leauing hys Captaines at Celaena, to receyue and gather togither them that fledde, and ſent Ambaſſadoures to the Conſull for to ceaſſe war, who was burying his dead ſouldiors, and ſpoyling his enimies, and gathering the captiues. Of the Romanes that were of the Cittie, there was ſlaine, foure and twentye horſemen, and thrée hundred footemen, chiefly of them whome Antiochus ſlewe. Eumenes loſte no more but fiftéen horſemen. The Kyngs loſſe with hys confederates, was iudged to be fiftie thouſand, which could not well be numbred for the multitude: all the Elephants were ſlaine, ſaue fiftéene, which were taken. After thys victorie ſo noble, & beyonde all reaſon, as ſome thoughte, not beyng lyke, that ſo fewe, in a ſtraunge Country, ſhould ouercome ſo many, eſpecially, where the Macedonian Phalanx was furniſhed full of men, whiche for the valiauntneſſe, was terrible, and thought inuincible, the friendes of Antiochus accuſed his raſheneſſe, in falling out with the Romaines, and his vnſkilfulneſſe, and fooliſhneſſe from the beginning, that he lefte Cherroneſus and Lyſimachia oute of hys handes, full of munition and money, before theThe errours of Antiochus.
                         
                        Romanes came alande to trye it, and neglected the guarding of Helleſpont, the whiche the Romanes thoughte they could not eaſlye paſſe by force. They blamed alſo his laſt ouerſight, making his chief ſtrength vnprofitable, by plaeing it ſo ſtreight, putting his truſt more in mingled multitude of men that were freſh ſoloures, than in men, that for experience and time, were acquainted with the warre, and by the continuaunce of the ſame, were endued with valiauntneſſe and courage. Theſe ſpéeches were made of Antiochus.
                     
                     The Romanes encreaſed incourage, and thought nothing too harde for them, bothe for their vertue, and the fauoure of the Gods. This did make to the opinion of their felicitie, that being ſo few againſt ſo many, in an expedition, and in the firſt fight, & in a ſtraunge land, they ſhould ouercome in one daye, ſo many

nations ſo princely a power, both for the vertue of the hired ſoldioures, and the glorie of the Macedonians, and for the great dominion of the King, as he hadde gotten the ſurname of Great: For in their ſpéeche and talke, King Antiochus the Great, was a greate word among them. The Romanes thus gloried of themſelues. The Conſul, after his brother Publius was come recouered from Elaea, anſwered Antiochus Ambaſſadors, which required to learne, what Antiochus ſhoulde do to be a friend to the Romanes, Publius anſwered thus vnto them.

This day do I goe to ſacrifice in the Capitoll, and as many of you as loue your Country, accompany me in the ſacrifice that is made for you.

It ſhall not bée amiſſe to ſhew how the Macedonians got Syria, and raigned there before the Romanes. For Alexander the King had Syria beyonde Perſia, and was king of al y• he won. When Alexander was dead, leauing children, one very yong, another in his mothers womb, the Macedonians for the loue of Philips houſe, choſe Arideus to be their king, that was Alexanders brother, although he was thoughte not to be wel in his minde, calling hym Philip in ſteade of Arideus, Alexanders children being yet with tutors, & the mother with child diligently kept. The friends diuided the nations, & Perdiccas was y• diuider, vnder king Philip. And the kings beingPerdiccas. dead not long after, the great men were made Kings. The firſt

Prince of Syria was Laomedon of Mitilene, ſet in by Perdiccas, and

Ptolomeus ſailed to Laomedon that was ruler of Siria, and perſwaded him by muche money, to lette him haue Syria, being an entrie to Egipt, and a defence to Ciprus, the whiche he denying, he tooke hym. And he deceyuing his kéepers, fledde to Alcetas into Caria. And a certaine time Ptolomie had Syria, and when he had left garriſons in the Cittie, hée ſayled into Egipt. Antigonus was prince of Phrygia, Lycia. & Pamphilia, being left ouerſéer of all Aſia, of Antipater, when he ſailed into Europe, to make warre vppon Eumenes, that was Prince of Cappadocia being iudged to be an enimy of the Macedonians, he fled and got Media for himſelfe. But Antigonus followed and killed hym, and procéeding, was royally receyued of Seleucus prince of Babilon. But when Seleucus had puniſhed one of the Captains, & not made Antigonus of counſell, being preſent, he was angrye, and called him to accompte both of money and ſubſtaunce. Hée béeyng too weake for Antigonus, fledde to Ptolomie into Egipt.

Antipater being deade, he was by and by ſuſpected to al the other prouinces, hauing ſo much land. Therfore by the perſuaſion chieflye of Seleucus, Ptolomie, and Lyſimacus Prince of Thracia, and Caſſander, ſon to Antipater and ruler of Macedonia after his father, they confederated togither, and ſent a common Ambaſſage, requiring hym to diuide the lande and money, that hée had gotte, among them and the other Macedonians that had loſte their prouinces.

And that a marriner did ſwimme to it, and ſet it vpon his heade, to bring it dryt to Alexander, and for his good ſeruice, the King rewarded him with a talent of ſiluer, the Soothſayers counſelling Alexander to kill him, and ſome ſaye Alexander did ſo, and ſome ſaye no. And ſome affyrme, that the Mariner did not ſwimme for it, but Seleucus, and that he put it vpon his heade, to bring it dryt, and that it was a token of bothe their fortunes. For Alexander died at Babilon, and Seleucus had the greateſt part of Alexanders lands of any of his ſucceſſors. Thus much haue I vnderſtanded of the tokens of his felicitie.
                     Immediatly after Alexanders death, he was made captain of the Guarde of horſemen, whiche Ephesteon had in Alexanders time, and after him, Perdiccas. After this office of horſemen, hée was Gouernour of Babilon, and of a Gouernoure was made a Kyng, and bycauſe he was victorious in his wars, he was called

                        Nicator, and therefore (I thinke) he had this name, rather than

He was of a great and mighty body, in ſo much, as when a wild Bull did breake his bandes at a ſacrifice that Alexander made, he only ſtopped him, and with his hands only ſtaid him, therefore they put hornes vpon his Images. He builded Cities al ouer his kingdomes, ſixtéene, named Antiochia,

For there is a deſtinie of Cities, as well as of men. And this Citie ſhal be of moſte long continuaunce by the appointment of God, being begon at this houre. We, fearing this building would haue bene a brydle to vs, went about to put by the deſtinie: but that is of greter force than eyther the ſubtiltie of the Soothſayers, or the ignorance of the king: For god gaue the happy time to the army, and by that only, you may learne, and thinke we can not nowe deceiue you. For thou the king diddeſt ſet with thyne armye, and thy ſelfe diddeſt commaund they ſhould tarry. And where they haue alwayes bin moſt obedient to thée in perils and paines, they could not now holde nor ſtay at thy commaundement, but went to it, not by partes, but altogither with their captaynes as they had bin commaunded, and they were commaunded in déed, for when thou commaundedſt to the contrarye, they would not heare it: what is there then greater among men, than a king, but God,God guideth kings. who is the ruler of thy will, and thy guide of this citie in ſteade of vs, and being oftēded with vs, and al our nation here about, for how can our things ſtande, when a ſtronger generation riſeth vpon vs? This citie ſhall be happy, mighty, and long continuing. Confirme thy pardon to vs, that haue erred for feare of the loſſe of our priuate goods. When the wiſemē had ſayd thus, Seleucus was glad and pardoned them. And this muche haue I learned of Seleucia.
                     
                     
                        Seleucus being aliue, made his ſonne king of all the high landes. And although this may appeare a princely and royall acte, yet more princely and moderate was the taking of hys ſonnes loue, and the tempering of the affection therof.
                     
                        Antiochus loued Stratonica wife to Seleucus and mother in lawe to hym, and had borne a childe to Seleucus. Antiochus being aſhamed of this ſtraunge paſſion, neyther proſecuted ſo euill a thing, nor vttered it, but was ſicke, pyning away, & gladly procured his own death.
                     
                        The notable phiſition Eraſistratus, of counſell wyth Seleucus inThe maruellous loue of Antiochꝰ moſte waightye affaires, coulde not coniecture the diſeaſe, till he had perceyued that his body was ſounde in all partes, then he iudged the diſeaſe to be of the minde, by the loue or affection of the whiche, the body is afflicted. Sorrow, anger, and care, be commonly diſcouered, but loue is kepte ſecreate in a modeſt mynde. Of the whiche, Antiochus woulde vtter nothing to hym, thoughe hee vſed all gentle meanes to learne it ſecretly. He ſate by him and obſerued all the mutations of hys bodye, howe they ſtoode when any came in, and finding that at all other hys body was quiet and féeble in like ſorte. But when Stratonica the Greate came in, to ſée him, his minde was vexed with ſhamefaſtneſſe and conſcience, and he then moſte diſquiet and ſilent, and his pulſes of it ſelfe, more liuely and mouing, and when ſhe was gone, féeble againe. The Phifition therefore tolde Seleucus that his ſonne was ſicke of an incurable diſeaſe.
                     The King aſking howe, and crying out for griefe, he ſayde, the ſickneſſe was Loue, and the loue of a woman, but it was impoſſible to haue hir. Seleucus maruelling, that there ſhoulde bée anye, that hée, being King of Aſia, could not perſuade to marry with his ſonne, either for fauour, for money and gifts, and for his whole Kingdome, which ſhoulde deſcend to the ſicke prince, the whiche he woulde giue him preſently, if any would preſerue his healthe, and only praide him to tell him whoſe wife it was. Then ſaide Eraſistratus, it is my wife that he loueth. Then Seleucus ſpake thus: O good Eraſistratus, for the friendſhip and benefitesA ſingular Phiſition. that thou haſt receyued of vs, for the rare wiſedome and vertue that is in thée, wylte thou not ſaue a young man and a King, and the ſonne of thy friend and a King, vnfortunate and temperate, hiding his euill, and more ready to dye? wilt thou ſo little paſſe of Antiochus? wilte thou ſo little regard Seleucus? He framing ſtill hys matter, ſaide, It is a thing by reaſon, that cannot be auoyded, for though you be his father, you would not let him haue youre wife, if he loued hir.
                     When Seleucus heard this, he ſware by all the kingly Gods,

that he woulde willingly and gladly let him haue hir, and be a noble example, of the loue of a good father to a ſonne, ſober, and continent in affliction, and vnworthy ſuch aduerſitie. Speaking many ſuch things, he began to be gréeued that he could not be a Phiſitian to the ſicke man, but that he muſt haue néede of

                     When he perceyued the King to be ſo earneſt in déede, and not to diſſemble, he declared the caſe, and ſhewed how he founde it out, for all his hiding of it. Seleucus being maruellous glad, had yet two things to do; the one to perſuade his ſonne, and the other to perſuade his wife. When he had ſo done, he called theA rare example of a princely fatherly loue to an afflicted modeſt ſonne. armie togither, which peraduenture had heard ſomewhat of the matter. He rehearſed vnto them the actes that he had done, and the great dominions that he had gotte aboue any of Alexanders ſucceſſoures, he ſette out at length. And bycauſe it was too muche for an olde man to gouerne, I will (quoth he) diuide the greatneſſe of it, for your better aſſurance in time to come, and I will giue part to them that I loue beſt. It is reaſon that all you do ioyne with me in all thinge, who haue bin encreaſed to ſo great rule and power vnder me, after Alexander.

The armye made acclamations, that he was the moſt noble King ſince Alexander, and the moſt worthy father.
                     When Seleucus had ſaid as muche to Stratonica and his ſonne, he celebrated the matrimony, and ſent them to their kingdoms,A moſt glorious acte▪

                     Thus dyed Seleucus at .lxxiij. yeares of his age, and .xltj. of his raigne. And I thinke the ſaying was meant of hym. Make no haſte to Europe, Aſia is better for thee: for Lyſimachia is in Europe, and this was the firſt time that he ſailed into Europe ſince he followed Alexander in the warre.

Some of the rulers of the citie, ſpake againſt it, that bicauſe Italy was troubled wt ſo gret war, Annibal yet waſting of it, & Mago in y• ſides of it, hyring ſtrāge ſouldiers in Ligurie & France, it was not good to make war vpon Libya, nor to inuade another Country, til the preſent hurt were healed at home. Some thought that the Carthaginians, whyche now without feare, did ouertunne Italie: bycauſe they were not vexed at home, if warre were made vppon them, woulde ſende for Annibal. Thus it was obtained to ſende Scipio into Libya, not ſuffering him to gather men in Italy, being yet waſted by Annibal, but graunting him to leade ſuch, as would willingly goe with hym, and to vſe them that were yet in Sicelie, gyuing him leaue to prepare tenne gallies, and to make ſupply for thē,The ſlender ſetting forth of Scipio to ſo great a vvarre. and to take them that were in Sicelie.

He appointed thrée hundred of the wealthy Sicilians, to come at a day aſſigned, furniſhed with as good armour and horſe as they coulde. When they were come, he graunted them, if they would, to giue other to ſerue in their place: where with being all content, he brought forth the thrée hundred that were vnarmed, and willed them to chaunge with them, they willinglye deliuered both horſe and harneſſe: & ſo Scipio had 300.

                         night, being hurte, fled to Anea with fyue hundred horſemen, where he gathered ſome of the hyred ſouldieures that were eſcaped from the fight, and the Numidians, and called bondmen to libertye. And when he heard the Carthaginians had determined his deathe, as an euill Generall, and had choſen Hanno, Bomilchares ſonne, in his place, he made an army of hys owne, and receyued all malefactours, and ledde them where he mighte haue reliefe, and trayned them, hauing thrée thouſande horſe, and eight thouſand footemen, as hauing his truſte onely in fight. In doing this, he kepte it long hid from both from the Romanes and Carthaginians, Scipio led his army to the walles of Carthage, and boldlye

called them to fight, but none came forth.
                     
                        Amilchar Admirall of Carthage, with an hundred ſhippes came vppon the nauy of Scipio, thinking to deſtroye it in his abſence, hoping eaſily to take twenty gallies with an hundred.
                     When Scipio ſawe him vnder ſayle, he ſent to ſhut the mouth of the Porte, and that the greate Shippes ſhoulde lye at anker with a diſtaunce one from another, that the gallies might come by them, as out of a gate, when néede ſhoulde require, and that they ſhoulde faſten and tye the ſhips togither wyth their ſayle yardes, that they might be as a wall: and he came to them and furthered their worke.
                     The Carthaginians were receyued both by ſea and lande, and
                           Scipio ſaueth the Romane shippes. from the wall with ſhot and artillerie, their ſhippes were bruſed, and other being weary, went away at night. And when they were going, the Romane galleis wente out of the ſpaces, as was appointed, and ſette vpon them, and when they were too weake, they retired, one they tooke voyde of men, and broughte hir to Scipio. Then they went both to their wintring harbours. The Romanes had plenty from the ſea: the Vticenſes and Carthaginians being in want, robbed the Merchantes, till other Romane ſhippes were ſent to Scipio, whiche, in ſet places, kepte the ennimie from robbing. They were more and more in hunger. Toward the end of Winter, Syphax being neare, Maſsiniſſa deſired the thirde part

                     The Numidians (as their manner is) made ſhotte very thick one againſte an other. The Romanes being couered with theyr ſhieldes, went to the fight. Syphax came with fury vppon Maſsiniſſa,

                         expert in that coūtry, led him about with him, & made him priuy of his mind & counſel, as Cyrus vſed Craeſus king of Libya.

                        Rome, a thouſand fiue hundred. Maſsiniſſa was there with many horſemen of Numidia, and Lacamas another prince with ſixe hundred horſe. He ſet his footemen in thrée battels as Anniball did: he made a particion betwéene the bandes, that the horſemenne might paſſe eaſily by them: he made to euery bande a defence at the front with ſtrong pertches layde ouer with yron of two Cuvits long and very thicke, to kepe backe the Elephantes as an engine, and he warned them and the other footemen, to giue place to the furie of thoſe beaſtes, and to caſt their dartes vpon them as faſt as they coulde, and when they were nigh, to cutte

their ſinowes if they coulde. Thus were they placed of Scipio. The Numidian horſe he placed in the wings, being acquainted with the fight and fury of the Elephants. The Italians horſe, bicauſe they were not vſed to them, he ſet laſt of all, to be readye to paſſe by the diſtances, when the footemen had bidden the firſt violence of the Elephants. Both ſorts of horſmen, had companies of ſhotte ioyned to them, to annoy the beaſtes. Thus were his horſemen ſet. The right wing he gaue to Laelius: the left, to Octauius: in the middeſt, was both he and Annibal, to kepe their glorie, hauing horſemen attending vpon them, to helpe where nede ſhould be. Annibal had thrée thouſand, Scipio had two thouſande, and the thrée hundred Italians, whom he armed in Sicelie. When all was ready, both of them encouraged their men. 
                           Scipio called the Gods to witneſſe, before his army, againſt whom the Carthaginians had offended, as ofte as they brake their promiſe,
                              Scipio to his ſouldiours. and required hys army not to loke to the number of their enimies, but to their owne vertue, whom, being more in number they had ouerthrowen euen in that lande: and if they that ouercome, haue anye feare or doubte, muche more of neceſſitie muſt they haue that haue bin ouercome. Thus did Scipio encourage and ſtirre his fewe number. Annibal recorded to them the feates that he hadde done in Italie, as an enterpriſe of moſte

Both of them did declare vnto their ſouldiours the daunger and greatneſſe of the preſent fight.
                     
                     
                        
                           Annibal ſhewed that Carthage and all Libya was to be tryed in thys fighte, whether they ſhoulde be ſlaues being ouercome, or rule hereafter ouer all they had wonne. Scipio tolde hys, that if they were defeated, they had no ſafe returne: if they dyd ouercome, a great dominion ſhoulde fall vnto them, and a reſt of their preſent paynes, a going home to their country, and a renouine for euer.
                     
                     Thus eyther of them encouraging other, they went to the fight: Annibal ſounded firſt: Scipio commaunded to aunſwere

It is like that hée conſidereth the matter better than we, and ſéeth more in it, bycauſe he hath al before him: if wée doe otherwiſe, we ſhall offende hys eſtimation, a good Citizen, and a noble Capitayne, who prouoked vs vnwilling to ſende into Affrica, and hauyng no army of vs, did gette one himſelfe, and hathe promoted vs ſo farre as we could not hope. Therefore it is to be wondered, that you that were ſo faint at the beginning in the warre, are nowe ſo earneſt and vehement. Nowe if any man thinketh all to bée well, and yet feareth that the Carthaginians will breake thys league, it is nowe moſte like they wyll kéepe the peace, being ſo ofte afflicted for breaking of it, and that henceforth they will kéepe Juſtice better, beyng fallen on the knée, by vnrighteouſneſſe.

There was a confuſed and miſerable mourning of them that broughte both publique and priuate things, that it made the Romaynes themſelues to wéepe. The Conſulls were alſo ſtricken wyth ſuche humaine mutation, and with ſeuere manner abode the fulneſſe of the matter,

                     When it was daye, the Carthaginians being ſure from the engines, builded vppe the fore parte of the wall againe, and made many Towers vpon it, by a certaine diſtaunce. The Romanes made other engines, and erected a trenche againſt the Towers.The Carthagies trenche gotten. making fire worke of pitche and ſulphure, and threw them vpon y• enimie. And when they had burned many of the Towers, they chaſed the Carthaginians that fledde. But where the ground was ſlippery with bloud and myre, they left the chaſe of themſelues.

And when the wall was vppe, he put in foure thouſand, whiche did not much paſſe of the enimie, throwing dartes and weapons vpon them with contempt, and bicauſe they were of like heigth, they were ſure to hit them. And thus the Sommer was ſpente. Winter being come, Scipio determined to take from the Carthaginians, al the power and friends that they had by lande, and ſente ſome one way, and ſome another, & he himſelfe went to Nepheris by water, where Diogenes that fauoured Aſdrubal, lay in camp, and ſent C.

And again, they aſked one of another, if Carthage were taken in déede? They ſpente all the night in talke, howe the armour was taken from them, and how they, beyond all hope, made more. Howe their ſhippes were taken from them, and howe they made a newe nauy of olde matter: howe the mouth of the porte was ſhutte, and howe in fewe dayes they opened another, and howe highe the walles were aboute the mouth, and the greatneſſe of the ſtones, and the fire whiche manye tymes they brought againſt the Engines: and ſette out a plat of all the warre, as thoughe they hadde then ſéene it done, and expreſſed the fantaſies of their mindes with the motions of their bodyes, thinking they ſawe Scipio wyth the ſcalyng ladders, with the ſhippes at the gates, at the fyghtes euer occupied.

                         gratifie Craſſus with one night to bury his ſonne, and to conſider with hymſelfe, whither it were better for him to go to Arſaces, or to be led to him. They thus going to a place nigh hande, were in greate hope. But the Romanes hadde an heauy night, neither burying the deade, nor healing the hurte, ſome dying, and all lamenting themſelues, for all things appeared wythoute helpe.

                     And althoughe they thoughte Craſſus to be the Authour of al this euill, yet they deſired to ſée hym and heare hym ſpeake. Hée was by himſelfe with his face couered in the darke. An example

                     But when they ſawe him in vtter deſperation, they called the officers and captaines, ſhewing it was no tarrying there, but to departe withoute ſounde of trumpe and ſecreately, whiche being done, and the hurte men perceyuing they were forſaken, a great lamentation with ſorrowfull crie was made in the Camp, which ſtaide them, with trouble and feare, as thoughe the enimie had come vpon them.

For he thinking that all was not well, bicauſe of the ſodaine and ſtraunge ſpéech, gathered his men togither, and went to méete Craſſus in the way, and receiue his ſouldiors into the Cittie. The Parthians hearing the going awaye by night, did not folow them.

                     Shortly after came certaine Arabians that knewe Craſſus and Caſsius, hauing bin in their camp before the fight.
                     They ſéeing Caſsius vpon the wall, ſaide, Surenas would make them friendes with the King, and ſaue them, ſo they woulde departe with Meſopotamia, for ſo it were better to do, than trie the vttermoſt.

                     When Surenas hearde this of the meſſengers, being glad that they were in a place as beſieged, he willed the Parthians the next daye to goe with a greate crie, and require, that if the Romanes woulde haue peace with the Parthians, to ſende Craſſus and Caſsius bounde to the King.
                     They were grieued that they were deceiued, and counſelled Craſsus to leaue the long and vaine hope of Armenia, and to ſaue himſelfe, and to let none of the Carrenans knowe it. But he made it knowne to Andromachus a very falſe fellowe, whome he truſted,

                         and made him guide of the way, ſo as nothing was kepte from the Parthians, all being tolde by Andromachus. And where it is not their cuſtome to fight by night, nor no ſure thing to thē, and where Craſſus went out by night, that they ſhoulde not be too farre off in folowing the fléeing Capitaines, Andromachus ledde the Romanes this way and that waye, and at laſte putte them in a fenny and marriſh place, which ſhould be hard for the footmē to folow.
