Of presence good ynough, but so palpably affected to his owne praise,
that (for want of flatterers) he commends himself to the floutage of his own

of publicke derision) to sticke to his own particular fashion, phrase,

husband; standing in as true dread of her displeasure, as when hee first made
loue to her. He doth sacrifice twopence in Iuniper to her euery morning before
sherises, & wakes her with villanous-out-of-tune Musick, which
shee out of her Contempt (though not out of her iudgement) is sure to dislike.

                  Some tast of their abuse of this word Humor.

                  O doe not let your purpose fall, good Asper,
                  
                  It cannot but arriue most acceptable,
                  Cheefely to such as have the happinesse
                  Daily to see how the poore innocent word
                  Is rackt, and tortur'd.
               
               
                  Mit.
                  I; I pray you proceed.
               
               
                  Asp.
                  Ha? what? what is 't?
               
               
                  Cord.
                  For the abuse of Humor.
               
               
                  
                  Asp.
                  O, I craue pardon, I had lost my thoughts.
                  VVhy Humor (as 'tis ens) we thus define it
                  To be a qualitie of aire or water,
                  And in it selfe holds these two properties,
                  Moisture and Fluxure: As for demonstration,
                  Poure water on this floore, 'twill wet and runne,
                  Likewise the aire (forc't through a horne or trumpet)
                  Flowes instantly away, and leaves behind
                  A kind of dew; and hence we doe conclude,
                  That what soe're hath fluxure and humiditie,
                  As wanting power to containe it selfe,
                  Is Humor: so in euery humane bodie
                  The choller, melancholy, flegme, and bloud,
                  By reason that they flow continually
                  In some one part, and are not continent,
                  Receiue the name of Humors. Now thus farre
                  It may by Metaphore applie it selfe
                  Vnto the generall disposition,
                  As when some one peculiar qualitie
                  Doth so possesse a man, that it doth draw
                  All his affects, his spirits, and his powers
                  In their confluctions all to runne one way,
                  This may be truly said to be a Humor,
                  But that a Rooke in wearing a pied feather,
                  The cable hatband, or the three-pild ruffe,
                  A yard of shoe-tie, or the Switzers knot
                  On his French garters, should affect a Humour,
                  O, 'tis more than most ridiculous.

                  He speakes pure truth: now if an Ideot
                  Have but an Apish or Phantasticke straine,
                  It is his Humour.

like Vetus Comoedia: a worke that hath bounteously pleased me,

                  No, I assure you signior; if those lawes you speake of,
had beene deliuered vs, ab Initio; and in their present vertue
and perfection, there had beene some reason of obeying their
powers: but 'tis extant, that that which wee call Comoedia, was
at first nothing but a simple and continued Satyre, sung by one
only person, till Susario invented a second, after him Epicharmus
a third, Phormus, and Chionides devised to have foure actors, with
a Prologue and Chorus; to which Cratinus (long after) added a fift
and sixt; Eupolis more, Aristophanes more than they: every
man in the dignitie of his spirit and judgement, supplied something:
and (though that in him this kind of Poeme appeared
absolute, and fully perfected) yet how is the face of it chang'd
since, in Menander, Philemon, Cecilius, Plautus, and the rest; who
have vtterly excluded the Chorus, altered the propertie of the
persons, their names, and natures, and augmented it with all
libertie, according to the elegancie and disposition of those
times wherein they wrote? I see not then but we should enjoy

the same Licentia or free power, to illustrate and heighten our
invention as they did; and not be tied to those strict and regular
forms, which the nicenesse of a fewe (who are nothing
but Forme) would thrust vpon vs.

                  Faith, if the time will suffer his description, I'le giue it
you: he is one, the Author calls him Carlo Buffone, an impudent
common jester, a violent railer, and an incomprehensible Epicure:
one, whose companie is desir'd of all men, but belou'd
of none; hee will sooner loose his soule than a jest, and prophane
euen the most holy things, to excite laughter: no honourable

seeme to take as vnpardonable offence as if hee had torne

the most part raine, good; for the most part raine: VVhy it
should raine fortie daies after now, more or lesse, it was a rule
held afore I was able to hold a plough, and yet here are two
daies, no rain; ha? it makes me muse. VVeele see how the next
month begins, if that be better. August: August, first, second,
third, and fourth daies, rainie, and blustering; this is well now:
fift, sixt, seventh, eight, and ninth, raine, with some thunder; I
marry, this is excellent; the other was false printed sure: the
tenth and eleuenth, great store of raine; O good, good, good,
good, good; the twelft, thirteenth, and fourteenth daies, rain;
good still: fifteenth and sixteenth, raine; good still: seuenteenth
and eighteenth, raine, good still; nineteenth and twentieth,
Good still, good still, good still, good still, good still; one and
twentieth, some raine; some raine? well, wee must bee patient,
and attend the heauens pleasure, would it were more though:
the one and twentith, two and twentith, three and twentith,
great tempest of raine, thunder, and lightning.

                           Right, for what a man truly enuies in another, he could
alwaies loue, and cherish in himselfe; but no man truly reprehends
in another what he loues in himselfe, therefore Reprehension
is out of his Hate. And this distinction hath he himselfe
made in a speech there (if you markt it) where hee saies, I enuie
not this Buffon, but I hate him.

                           Stay sir: I enuie not this Buffon, but I hate him: why might
he not as well haue hated Sordido as him?

                           No sir, there was subject for his envie in Sordido; his
wealth: So was there not in the other, he stood possest of no
one eminent gift, but a most odious and fiend-like disposition,
that would turne Charitie it selfe into Hate, much more Envie
for the present.

                        Fungoso sir.
                  
                  
                     Fast.
                     Good Signior Fungoso, I shall request to know you better sir.
                  
                  
                     Fun.
                     I am her brother Sir.
                  
                  
                     Fast.
                     In faire time sir.
                  
                  
                     Pun.
                     Come Gentlemen, I will be your Conduct.
                  
                  
                     Fast.
                     Nay pray you sir; we shall meet at Signior Deliro's often.
                  
                  
                     Sog.
                     You shall ha'me at the Heralds office sir, for some week
or so, at my first comming vp. Come Carlo.
                     
                  
                  Exeunt.
                  
                     
                        GREX.
                        
                           Mit.
                           Me thinks Cordatus, he dwelt somwhat too long on this
Scene; it hung i'the hand.
                        
                        
                           Cord.
                           I see not where he could haue insisted lesse, and t'haue
made the Humors perspicuous enough.
                        
                        
                           Mit.
                           True, as his Subject lies: but he might haue altered the
shape of Argument, & explicated 'hem better in single Scenes.
                           
                        
                        
                           
                           Cord.
                           That had been Single indeed: why? be they not the
same persons in this, as they would haue been in those? and is
it not an object of more State, to behold the Scene full, and relieu'd
with varietie of Speakers to the end, than to see a vast
emptie stage, and the Actors come in (one by one) as if they
were dropt down with a feather into the eie of the Audience?
                        
                        
                           Mit.
                           Nay, you are better traded with these things than I, and
therefore I'le subscribe to your judgement; mary you shall
giue me leaue to make objections.
                        
                        
                           Cord.
                           O what else? it's the speciall intent of the Author you
should do so: for thereby others (that are present) may as well
be satisfied, who happily would object the same you doe.
                        
                        
                           Mit.
                           So sir, but when appeares Macilente againe?
                        
                        Enter Macilente, Deliro, Fido, with hearbs and persumes.
                        
                           Cord.
                           Mary he staies but till our silence giue him leaue: here
he comes, and with him Signior Deliro a merchant, at whose
house he is come to sojourne: Make your owne obscruation
now; onely transferre your thoughts to the Cittie with the
Scene; where, suppose they speake.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  SCENA TERTIA.
                  
                     Deliro.
                     I'le tell you by and by sir.
                     VVelcome (good Macilente) to my house,
                     To sojourne euen for euer; if my best
                     In cates, and euerie sort of good intreatie
                     May moou
                           •
                         you stay with me.
                  
                  Deliro turnes to his boy, and falls a strowing of flowers.
                  
                     Mac.
                     I thanke you sir:
                     And yet the muffled Fates (had it pleas'd them)
                     Might haue suppli'd me from their owne full store
                     VVithout this word (I thanke you) to a foole.
                     I see no reason why that Dog (
                           •
                        all'd Chaunce)
                     Should fawne vpon this fellow more than me:
                     I am a man, and I haue Limmes, Flesh, Blood,
                     Bones, Sinewes, and a Soule as well as he:
                     
                        
My parts are euery way as good as his,
                     If I said better? why I did not lie,
                     Nath'lesse his wealth (but nodding on my wants)
                     Must make me bow, and crie: I thanke you Sir.
                     
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Dispatch, take heed your mistresse see you not.
                  
                  
                     Fido.
                     I warrant you sir.
                     Exit Fido.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Nay gentle friend be merrie, raise your lookes
                     Out of your bosome, I protest (by heauen)
                     You are the man most welcome in the world.
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     
                        I thanke you Sir, I know my cue I thinke.
                  
                  Enter Fido with two Censors.
                  
                     Fido.
                     VVhere will you haue 'hem burne Sir?
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Here good Fido:
                     
                     VVhat? she did not see thee?
                  
                  
                     Fido.
                     No Sir.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     That's well:
                     Strew, strew, good Fido, the freshest flowers, so.
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     VVhat meanes this Signior Deliro?
                     
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Cast in more Frankincence, yet more, well said.
                     O Macilente, I haue such a wife,
                     So passing faire, so passing faire vnkind,
                     And of such worth and right to be vnkind,
                     (Since no man can be worthie of her kindnesse.)
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     VVhat can there not?
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     No, that is sure as death,
                     No man aliue: I doe not say is not,
                     
                     But cannot possibly be worth her kindness
                           •
                        .
                     Nay that is certaine, let me doe her Right:
                     How said I? do her Right? as though I could,
                     As though this dull grosse tongue of mine could vtter
                     The rare, the true, the pure, the infinite Rights
                     That sit (as high as I can looke) within her.
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     This is such dotage as was neuer heard.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     VVell, this must needs be granted.
                  
                  
                     Maci.
                     Graunted quoth you?
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Nay Macilente; doe not so discredit
                     
                        The goodnesse of your judgement to denie it,
                     For I doe speake the very least of her.
                     And I would craue and beg no more of heauen
                     For all my fortunes here, but to be able
                     To vtter first in fit tearmes, what she is,
                     And then the true joies I conceiue in her.
                  
                  
                     Maci.
                     Is't possible she should deserue so well
                     As you pretend?
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     I, and she knowes so well
                     Her owne deserts that (when I striue t'enjoy them)
                     She waies the things I doe, with what she merits:
                     And (seeing my worth outwai'd so in her graces)
                     She is so solemne, so precise, so froward,
                     That no obseruance I can doe to her,
                     Can make her kind to me: if she find fault,
                     I mend that fault, and then she saies I faulted
                     That I did mend it. Now good Friend aduise me
                     How I may temper this strange Splene in her.
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     You are too amorous, too obsequious,
                     And make her, too assur'd she may commaund you.
                     VVhen women doubt most of their husbands loues,
                     They are most louing. Husbands must take heed
                     They giue no gluts of kindnesse to their wiues,
                     But vse them like their Horses, whom they feed
                     Not with a manger-full of meat together,
                     But halfe a pecke at once, and keepe them so
                     Still with an appetite to that they giue them.
                     He that desires to haue a louing wife,
                     Must bridle all the shew of that desire:
                     Be kind, not amorous, nor bewraying kindnesse,
                     As if Loue wrought it, but considerate Dutie:
                     "Offer no loue-rites, but let wiues still seeke them,
                     "For when they come vnsought, they seldome like them.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Beleeue me Macilente, this is Gospell.
                     O that a man were his owne man so much,
                     To rule himselfe thus; I will striue i' faith
                     
                        
To be more strange and carelesse: yet I hope
                     I haue now taken such a perfect course,
                     To make her kind to me, and liue contented,
                     That I shall find my kindnesse well return'd,
                     And haue no need to fight with my affections.
                     She (late) hath found much fault with euery roome
                     VVithin my house; One was too big (she said)
                     Another was not furnisht to her mind,
                     And so through all: All which I haue alter'd.
                     Then here she hath a place (on my backeside)
                     VVherein shee loues to walke; and that (shee said)
                     Had some ill smels about it. Now this walke
                     Haue I (before she knowes it) thus perfum'd
                     VVith herbes and flowers, and laid in diuerse places
                     (As 'twere on Altars consecrate to her)
                     Perfumed Gloues, and delicate chaines of Amber,
                     To keepe the aire in awe of her sweet nosthrils:
                     This haue I done, and this I thinke will please her.
                     Behold she comes.
                  
                  Enter Fallace.
                  
                     Fall.
                     Here's a sweet stinke indeed:
                     VVhat, shall I euer be thus crost and plagu'd?
                     And sicke of Husband? O my head doth ake
                     As it would cleaue asunder with these sauors,
                     All my Room's alter'd, and but one poore VValke
                     That I delighted in, and that is made
                     So fulsome with perfumes, that I am fear'd
                     (My braine doth sweat so) I haue caught the Plague.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     VVhy (gentle wife) is now thy VValke too sweet?
                     Thou said'st of late it had sower aires about it,
                     And found'st much fault, that I did not correct it.

                     VVhy, and I did find fault Sir?
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Nay deere wife;
                     I know thou hast said thou hast lou'd perfumes,
                     No woman better.
                  
                  
                     
                     Fall.
                     I, long since perhaps,
                     But now that Sence is alterd: you would haue me
                     (Like to a puddle or a standing poole)
                     To haue no motion, nor no spirit within me.
                     No, I am like a pure and sprightly Riuer,
                     That moues for euer, and yet still the same;
                     Or fire that burnes much wood, yet still one flame.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     But yesterday, I saw thee at our garden
                     Smelling on Roses and on purple flowers,
                     And since I hope the Humor of thy Sence
                     Is nothing chang'd.
                  
                  
                     Fall.
                     VVhy those were growing flowers,
                     And these within my walke are cut and strew'd.

                     But yet they haue one sent.
                  
                  
                     Fall.
                     I, haue they so?
                     In your grosse judgement: if you make no difference
                     Betwixt the sent of growing flowers and cut ones,
                     You haue a sence to tast Lampe-oyle, yfaith.
                     And with such judgement haue you chang'd the chambers,
                     Leauing no roome that I can joy to be in
                     In all your house: and now my VValke and all
                     You smoke me from, as if I were a Foxe,
                     And long belike to driue me quite away:
                     VVell walke you there, and I'le walke where I list.

                     That brought him such a Starre? blind Fortune still
                     Bestowes her gifts on such as cannot vse them:
                     How long shall I liue, ere I be so happie,

As though he lou'd? lou'd? nay honour'd and ador'd?

                     VVell, would my father had left me but a good Face
for my portion yet; though I had shar'd the vnfortunate VVit
that goes with it, I had not car'd: I might haue past for somewhat

vertues: it makes him that hath it without meanes, esteemed
for an excellent VVit: he that enjoyes it with means, puts the
world in remembrance of his meanes: it helpes the deformities
of Nature, and giues Lustre to her beauties; makes continuall
Holiday where it shines; sets the wits of Ladies at worke,
that otherwise would be idle: furnisheth your two-shilling
Ordinarie; takes possession of your Stage at your new Play;
and enricheth your Oares, as scorning to go with your Scull.

Torture.

                           Cord.
                           No in good faith: vnlesse mine eyes could light mee
beyond Sence, I see no reason why this should be more Liable
to the Racke than the rest: you'le say perhaps the Cittie will
not take it wel, that the Merchant is made here to dote so perfectly
vpon his wife; and shee againe, to be so Fastidiously affected,
as she is?

                           VVhy (by that proportion) the Court might as well
take offence at him we call the Courtier, and with much more
Pretext, by how much the place transcends and goes before
in dignitie and vertue: but can you imagine that any Noble
or true spirit in the Court (whose Sinewie, and altogither vnaffected
graces, very worthily expresse him a Courtier) will
make any exception at the opening of such an emptie Trunk
as this Briske is? or thinke his owne worth empeacht by beholding
his motley inside?

                           No more, assure you, will any graue wise Cittizen, or
modest Matron, take the object of this Follie in Deliro and his
VVife; but rather apply it as the foile to their owne vertues:
For that were to affirme, that a man writing of Nero, should
meane all Emperours: or speaking of Machiavell, comprehend
all States-men; or in our Sordido, all Farmars; and so of the
rest: than which, nothing can bee vtter'd more malicious
and absurd. Indeed there are a sort of these narrow-ey'd Decipherers,
I confesse, that will extort straunge and abstruse
meanings out of any Subject, bee it neuer so Conspicuous
and Innocently deliuerd. But to such (where e're they sit conceald)
let them know, the Authour defies them, and their
writing-Tables; and hopes, no sound or safe judgement
will infect it selfe with their contagious Comments, who

(indeed) come here only to pervert and poyson the sence of
what they heare, and for nought else.

condition of this greene and soggie multitude: but in
good faith Signior, your Author hath largely outstript my expectation
in this Scene, I will liberally confesse it. For when I
saw Sordido so desperately intended, I thought I had had a hand
of him then.

                           I did; and had fram'd my objection to it readie, which
may yet be very fitly vrg'd, & with some necessitie: for though
his purpos'd violence lost th'effect, & extended not to death,
yet the Intent & Horror of the object was more than the nature
of a Come die will in any sort allow.

Cistellaria there? where he brings in Alcesimarchus with a drawne
sword readie to kill himselfe, and as hee is e'ne fixing his breast
vpon it, to bee restrain'd from his resolu'd outrage by Silenium

approbation?

Melancholie in him, it would make him melancholie, to see
his yeomanly father cut his neighbours throats to make his
sonne a Gentleman: and yet when he has cut 'hem, hee will
see his sonnes throat cut too, ere he make him a true Gentleman
indeed, before Death cut his owne throat▪ I must be the
first Head of our house, and yet he will not giue mee the head,
till I be made so. Is any man tearm'd a Gentleman that is not

of a Pouder, or a Ring, or to hang any three-forked Charme
about my Dogs necke, secretly conuey'd into his Collar: vnderstand

fraud or Imposture.

                     Carl.
                     Friend? Is there any such foolish thing i'the world?
ha? S'lid I ne're rellisht it yet.

                     Carl.
                     No not a whit Signior: Tut, a man must keepe time in
all: I can oyle my tongue when I meet him next, and looke
with a good slicke forehead; 'twill take away all soyle of Suspicion,
and that's inough: what Lynceus can see my heart? Pish,
the title of a Friend, it's a vaine idle thing, only venerable among
fooles: you shall not haue one that has any opinion of
wit affect it.
                  
                  Enter Deliro, and Macilente.
                  
                     Deli.
                     Saue you good Sir Puntarvolo.
                     
                  
                  
                     Punt.
                     Signior Deliro! Welcome.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Pray you sir, did you see Master Fastidius Briske? I heard
he was to meet your VVorship here.
                  
                  
                     
                     Punt.

                     Deli.
                     In good time sir.
                  
                  
                     Carl.
                     There's a fellow now, lookes like one of the Patricians
of Sparta, mary his wit's after ten i'the hundred. A good Bloudhound,
a close mouth'd Dog, hee followes the sent well, marry
hee's at a fault now me thinks.
                  
                  
                     Punt.
                     I should wonder at that Creature is free from the
daunger of thy tongue.
                  
                  
                     Carl.
                     O I cannot abide these limmes of Sattin, or rather Sathan
indeed, that 'll walke (like the children of darkenesse) all
day in a melancholy shop, with their pockets full of Blankes,
readie to swallow vp as many poore vnthrifts, as come within
the verge.
                  
                  
                     Punt.
                     So: and what hast thou for him that is with him now?
                  
                  
                     Carl.
                     O (Damne me) Immortalitie, I'le not meddle with him,
the pure Element of Fire, all Spirit, Extraction.

                     Car.
                     A scholler, Macilente, doe you not know him? a lanke
rawbon'd Anatomie, he walks vp and down like a charg'd Musket,
no man dares encounter him: that's his Rest there.
                  
                  
                     Punt.
                     His Rest? why has he a forked head?
                  
                  
                     Carl.
                     Pardon me, that's to be suspended, you are too quick,
too apprehensiue.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Troth (now I think on't) I'le defer it til some other time.

                     Gods-pretious, not by any meanes Signior, you shall
not loose this opportunitie, he will be here presently now.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Yes faith Macilente, 'tis best. For looke you sir, I shall so
exceedingly offend my wife in't, that—
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     Your wife? now for shame loose these thoughts, and
become the master of your own spirits. Should I (if I had a wife)
suffer my self to be thus passionatly caried (to and for) with the
streame of her Humort and neglect my deepest affairs, to serue
her affections? Sbloud I would geld my selfe first.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     O but Signior, had you such a wife as mine is, you wold—
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     Such a wife: Now God hate mee sir, if euer I discern'd

any wonder in your wife yet, with all the Speculation I haue: I
haue seene some that ha'beene thought fairer than she, in my
time; and I haue seene those, ha'not beene altogether so tall,
esteem'd proper women; and I haue seen lesse Noses grow vpon
sweeteer Faces, that haue done very well too in my judgemment:
but in good faith Signior for all this, the Gentlewoman
is a good prettie prowd hard-fauour'd thing, mary not so peerlessely
to be doted vpon, I must confesse: nay be not angrie.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     VVell sir (how euer you please to forget your selfe) I
haue not deseru'd to be thus plai'd vpon, but henceforth, pray
you forbear my house, for I can but faintly endure the sauor of
his breath at my table, that shal thus jade me for my courtesies.
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     Nay then Signior, let me tell you, your wife is no proper
woman by Iesu, and I suspect her honestie, that's more,
which you may likewise suspect (if you please:) doe you see? Ile
vrge you to nothing against your appetite, but if you please,
you may suspect it.
                  
                  
                     Deli.
                     Good Sir.
                     Exit.
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     Good sir? Now Horne vpon Horne pursue thee, thou
blind egregious Dotard.

                     O you shall heare him speake like Enuie. Signior Macilente,

                     Mac.
                     I Buffone, I was with him.
                  
                  
                     Carl.
                     And how is hee respected there? (I know youle deale
ingeniously with us) is he made of amongst the sweeter sort of
gallants?
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     Faith I, his Ciuet and his casting glasse,
                     
                     Haue helpt him to a place amongst the rest,
                     And there his Seniors giue him good sleight lookes,

                     VVhy say, that they should shew the frothie foole,

VVhy all their Graces are not to doe Grace
                     To vertue, or desert: but to ride both

Knight Puntarvolo man; hee's to trauaile now presently: hee
has a good knottie wit, marry he carries little on't out of the

                     O, you know him; crie you mercie: before God, I think

Europe's a huge thing within the walls.

                     Tut, (and 'twere as huge againe) I'ld justifie what I

I neuer saw a man doe it more resolute.

                     Nay indeed swaggering is a good Argument of Resolution.
Doe you heare this, Signior?

my selfe into this figure: now he, comes violently on, and withall
advancing his Rapier to strike, I thought to haue took his
arme (for he had left his whole body to my election, and I was

a gold Cable hatband then new come vp, (which I wore about

was Massie, gold-Smithes worke) cuts my brimmes, which by
good fortune (being thicke embrodered with gold twist, and

                     Beats'hem not ragged for their wretched soules,
                     And since as fruitlesse, euen as blacke as coales.

                           VVhy but Signior, how comes it that Fungoso appear'd

not with his sisters intelligence to Briske.

                           Mary long of the euill Angels that shee gaue him,
who haue indeed tempted the good simple youth to follow
the taile of the Fashion, and neglect the imposition of
his friends. Behold here hee comes, very VVorshipfully attended,
and with good varietie.

                     Nay faith Sir, the Hat's as good as any man i' this

                     Fung.
                     Do's it apply well to my sute?

                     Nay (beleeue me) I thinke I haue as good a bodie in

                     Farewell good Haberdasher, well now maister Smp let

                           Mee thinkes he discharges his followers too thicke,
O therin he faucily imitates some Great man. I warrant
you though he turnes off them, he keepes this
Taylor in place of a Page to follow him still.

                     This Bill is very reasonable in faith, harke you maister
Snip. Troth sir I am not altogether so well furnisht at this

                     Fung.
                     Marry I haue here foure Angels, and fifteene shillings
of White money, it's all I haue as'hope to be sau'd.
                  
                  
                     Tay.
                     You will not faile mee at the next Tearme with the

                     Fung.
                     No and I doe, pray God I bee hang'd. Let me neuer
breath againe vpon this mortall Stage, as the Philosopher
cals it. By this aire, and (as I am a Gentleman) I'le hold.

                           He were an yron-hearted fellow in my judgement,
that would not credite him vpon these monstrous
others.

                     VVell sir, I'le not sticke with any Gentleman for a

                     I sir, and I giue you thankes in good faith, O God how
happie am I made in this good fortune. VVell, now I'le goe

                     Carl.
                     Faith Gallants, I am persuading this Gentleman to
turne Courtier, he is a man of faire Reuenue, and his estate will
beare the charge well, besides for his other gifts of the mind,
or so, why, they are as Nature lent him 'hem, pure, simple, without
any Artificiall drug or mixture of these two thredbare beggerly
qualities, Learning and Knowledge, and therefore the more
accommodate and Gen

                           ine. Now for the life it selfe—
                  
                  
                     Fasti.
                     O, the most Celestiall, and full of wonder and delight
that can bee imagin'd Signior, beyond all thought and
apprehension of Pleasure. A man liues there in that deuine
Rapture, that he will thinke himselfe i' the third Heauen for the
time, and loose all sence of Mortalitie whatsoeuer; when hee
shall behold such glorious (and almost immortall) beauties,
heare such Angelicall and Harmonious voices, discourse with
such flowing and Ambrosian spirits, whose wits as suddaine as
Lightning, and humorous as Nectar; Oh: it makes a man all
Quintessence and Flame, and lifts him vp (in a moment) to the very
Christall Crowne o'the skie, where (houering in the strēgth
of his Imagin
                              •
                           tion) he shall behold all the delights of the Hesperides,
the Insulae Fortunatae, Adonis gardens, Tempe, or what else
(confin'd within the amplest verge of Poesie) to bee meere Vmbrae,
and imperfect Figures, confer'd with the most essentiall
felicitie of your Court.
                  
                  
                     Mac.
                     VVel this ENCOMION was not extemporall, it came
too perfectly off.
                  
                  
                     Car.
                     Besides Sir, you shall neuer need to goe to a hothouse,
you shall sweat there with courting your mistresse, or loosing
your money at Primero, as well as in all the Stoues in Flaunders.

Mary this sir, you must euer be sure to carrie a good strong perfume
about you, that your mistresse Dog may smell you out
amongst the rest; and (in making loue to her) neuer feare to
be out: for you may haue a pipe of Tabacco, or a base Violl shall
hang o'the wall of purpose, will put you in presently. The
Tricks your Resolution has taught you in Tabacco, (the VVhiffe,
and those sleights) will stand you in very good Ornament
there?
                  
                  
                     Fasti.
                     I, to some perhaps: but, and hee should come to
my Mistresse with Tabacco (this Gentleman knowes) shee 'ld
replie vpon him yfaith. Oh (by this bright sunne) shee has the
most acute, readie, and facetious wit, that—tut there's no
spirit able to stand her. You can report it Signior, you haue
seene her?
                  
                  
                     Punt.
                     Then can he report no lesse out of his judgement, I assure
him.
                  
                  
                     Maci.
                     Troth I like her well ynough, but shee's too selfe-conceited
me thinkes.
                  
                  
                     Fast.
                     I indeed, shee's a little too selfe-conceited, and 'twere
not for that Humor, she were the most to bee admir'd Ladie in

                           O hee's a fellow of a strange Nature. Now do's hee (in
this calme of his Humor) plot and store vp a world of malicious
thoughts in his braine, till he is so full with 'hem, that you shall
see the very Torrent of his Envie breake forth, and against
the course of all their affections oppose it selfe so violently,
that you will almost haue wonder to thinke how 'tis possible
the current of their Dispositions shall receiue so quicke and
strong an alteration.

                           I marry sir, this is that on which my Expectation has
dwelt all this while: for I must tell you Signior (though I was
loth to interrupt the Scene) yet I made it a question in mine
owne priuate discourse, how hee should properly call it, Euerie
man out of his Humor, when I saw all his Actors so strongly pursue
and continue their Humors?

                           VVhy therein his Art appeares most full oflustre, and
approcheth nearest the life, especially when in the flame and
height of their Humors they are laid flat, it fils the eye better,
and with more contentment. How tedious a sight were it to
behold a prowd exalted tree lopt and cut downe by degrees,
when it might be feld in a moment? and to set the Axe to it, before
it came to that pride and fulnesse, were as not it haue it
grow.

                     I must leaue him with one that is ignorant of his qualitie,

merrie, it's all one: be sure to kisse your hand often enough;
pray for her health, and tell her, how more than most faire she is:
Screw your face at' one side thus, & Protest; let her fleere and
looke a skaunce, and hide her Teeth with her Fanne, when
shee laughes a fitte, to bring her into more matter; that's nothing:
you must talke forward (though it be without sense, so
it be without blushing) 'tis most Courtlike and well.

discourse, to deliuer you a Modell of any Princes Court in the
world: 'speakes the Languages with that puritie of Phrase, and
facilitie of Accent, that it breeds astonishment: his VVit, the
most Exuberant, and (aboue wonder) pleasant, of all that euer
entred the concaue of this care.

                     O excellent: why Gallants, is this hee cannot be
Decipher'd? they were very bleare-witted yfaith that could
not discerne the Gentleman in him.
                  
                  
                     Punt.

in the carriage of his eye, and that inward power that forms
his countenance, you might perceiue his counterfaiting as
cleere as the noone day: Alas; Nay if you would haue tried my

                     'Tis an Axiome in Naturall Philosophie, What comes nearest
the Nature of that it feeds, conuerts quicker to nourishment, and doth

d'offeth off his owne Nature, and puts on theirs; as when hee

                     O Christ Maister Fastidius, if you knew how I tooke vp
my husband to day, when he said he would arrest you; and how
I rail'd at him that persuaded him to't, the Scholler there, (who
on my conscience loues you now) & what care I tooke to send
you intelligence by my Brother; and how I gaue him foure Soueraignes
for his paines; and now, how I came running out
hether without man or boy with mee, so soone as I heard on't;
you'ld say, I were in a Passion indeed: your keeper for Gods
sake. O Maister Briske (as 'tis in Euphues) Hard is the choise, when one
is compelled either by silence to die with gree

Deceptio visus, or so, ha? if you could persuade your

you can doe Signior; it may bee your Imagination will bee
brought to it in time, there's nothing impossible.

                     O yes Sir: I can tell you a thing will distract you
much better, beleeue it. Signior Deliro has entred three Actions
against you, three Actions Mounsieur: mary one of them (I'le
put you in comfort) is but three thousand mark, and the other
two some fiue thousand pound together, trifles, trifles.

                  Than it hath stuffe to feed it, and their vertue,

                  Affords no ampler Subject to my Spirit;
                  I am so farre from malicing their states,
                  That I begin to pittie 'hem: it greeues me
                  To thinke they haue a being; I could wish
                  They might turne wise vpon it, and be sau'd now,
                  So Heauen were pleas'd: but let them vanish Vapors.

            IT had another Catastrophe or Conclusion, at the first
Playing: which (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

many seem'd not to rellish it; and therefore 'twas since

it was not so great a part of the Heauen awry, as they would
make it; we request him but to looke downe vpon these following
Reasons.
            1 There hath been President of the like Presentation in diuers
Playes: and is yeerely in our Cittie Pageants or shewes of
Triumph.
            
            2 It is to be conceiu'd, that Macilente being so strongly possest
with Enuie, (as the Poet heere makes him) it must bee no
sleight or common Object, that should effect so suddaine and
straunge a cure vpon him, as the putting him cleane Out of
his Humor.
            
            3 If his Imagination had discours't the whole world ouer for
an Object, it could not haue met with a more Proper, Emiment,
or worthie Figure, than that of her Maiesties: which
his Election (though boldly, yet respectively) vs'd to a Morall
and Mysterious end.
            4 His greedinesse to catch at any Occasion, that might expresse
his affection to his Soueraigne, may worthily plead
for him.
            5 There was nothing (in his examin'd Opinion) that could
more neare or truly exemplifie the power and strength of her
Inualuable Vertues, than the working of so perfect a Miracle
on so oppos'd a Spirit, who not only persisted in his Humor,
but was now come to the Court with a purpos'd resolution
(his Soule as it were new drest in Enuie) to maligne at
any thing that should front him; when sodainly (against expectation,

and all steele of his Malice) the verie wonder of
her Presence strikes him to the earth dumbe, and astonisht.
From whence rising and recouering heart, his Passion thus

                  •
               vtters it selfe.
            
               Maci.
               Blessed, Diuine, Vnblemisht, Sacred, Pure,
               Glorious, Immortall, and indeed Immense;
               
               O that I had a world of Attributes,
               To lend or adde to this high Maiestie:
               
               Neuer till now did Obiect greet mine eyes
               VVith any light Content: but in her Graces
               
               All my malitious Powers haue lost their stings:
               
                  Enuie is fled my Soule at sight of her,
               And shee hath chac'd all blacke thoughts from my bosome,
               Like as the Sunne doth darkenesse from the world.
               My streame of Humor is runne out of me:
               And as our Citties Torrent (bent t'infect
               The hallow'd bowels of the siluer Thames)
               Is checkt by strength and clearenesse of the Riuer,
               Till it hath spent it selfe e'ene at the shore;
               So in the ample and vnmeasur'd Flood
               Of her Perfections, are my Passions drown'd:
               And I haue now a Spirit as sweet and cleere,
               As the most rarefi'd and subtile Aire;
               VVith which, and with a heart as pure as Fire,
               (Yet humble as the Earth) doe I implore,
               He Kneeles.
               O Heauen: that Shee (whose Figure hath effected
               This change in me) may neuer suffer Change
               In her Admir'd and happie Gouernment:
               May still this Iland be call'd Fortunate,
               
               And Rugged Treason tremble at the sound
               VVhen Fame shall speake it with an Emphasis.
               
               Let forraine Pollicie be dull as Lead,
               And pale Inuasion come with halfe a heart
               VVhen he but lookes vpon her blessed Soile:
               
                  
The Throat of Warre be stopt within her Land,
               And Turtle-footed Peace daunce fairie Rings
               About her Court; where neuer may there come
               
                  Suspect or Daunger, but all Trust and Safetie:
               
               Let Flatterie be dumbe, and Enuie blind
               In her dread Presence: Death himselfe admire her:
               And may her Vertues make him to forget
               The vse of his ineuitable hand.
               Fly from her Age; Sleepe Time before her Throne,
               Our strongest wall falls downe when shee is gone.
            
            Here the Trumpets sound a florish, in which time Macilente conuerts
himselfe to them that supply the place of GREX, and speakes.

                     Mary because wee'le imitate your Actors, and be out of

abilitie in Censure than wee, whose Iudgements can giue it a

and return'd to you as I was Asper at the first: but (by reason
the Shift would haue been somewhat long, and we are loth to
draw your Patience any farder) wee'le intreat you to imagine
it. And now (that you may see I will be out of Humor for companie)
I stand wholly to your kind Approbation, and (indeed)
am nothing so peremptorie as I was in the beginning: Mary
I will not doe as Plautus in his Amphitryo for all this (Summi Iouis
causa, Plaudite:) begge a Plaudite for Gods sake; but if you (out
of the Bountie of your good liking) will bestow it; why, you
may (in time) make leane Macilente as fat as Sir Iohn Fallstaffe.
