            Then harken to this mery tale
            Was neuer meryer ſet to ſale
            At Abyngton it ſo befell
            Therby a widowe late did dwell
            She had two ſonnes that ſhe loued well
            For father had they none
            At Cambrige are they ſet I wene
            Fiue mile is them bytwene
            Their ſpendinge was full mene,
            To the ſcole there did they go
            Some learning for to get you knowe
            By good mens helpe they were kept ſo
            Other finding none they had
            This life longe they ledde
            The mother founde them at borde and bedde
            And by theſe meanes were they fedde
            More than ſeuen yere
            Their mother then vpon a daie
            To Cambridhe ſhe toke the waie
            And to hir ſonnes gan ſhe ſaie
            With a heuy chere
            Sonnes I will be here anone
            And than I wot ye will come home
            
               But corne nor bread can I get none,
            The countrey is ſo deere.
            Mother then they ſayd anone
            we wyll into the countrey gone
            To goōd men and make our mone
            If wee may any thinge get,
            So longe they went from towne to towne
            In the countrey vp and downe
            That they gate in ſhort ſeaſon
            A large met of wheate
            Than anone when they it had
            Vnto their mother they it lad
            And ſhe therof was full glad
            But longe they ne let
            But at their neyghbours houſe on the morne
            They borowed a horſe to cary their corne
            To the mille them beforne
            For nothing wolde they let
            The mylner was ioly in his workes all
            He had a doughter fayre and ſmall
            The clerke of the towne loued her aboue all
            Iankyn was his name
            The mylner was ſo trewe and fele
            Of each mannes corne wolde he ſteale
            More than his Tolediſh by a deale
            He let for no ſhame
            He was ſo ſubtyll and ſo ſlye
            He wolde it take before their eye
            And make them a proper lye
            And put himſelfe out of blame▪
            
            
               To the mylner they were ſande
            In the mylle dore dyd he ſtande
            They tied their horſe with a bande
            They had harde of his name
            That one clerke to that other ſware
            Of the theefe we wyll beware

            And the meale in all
            Though he be neuer ſo wo
            And I wyl vp vnto the ſtones go
            And he begyle vs bothe two
            Foule might him befall:
            The corne vp the Milner wan

            Two myle from Abyngton
            In his herte had he care
            For the clerkes were ſo ware

               yd are
            But to his ſonne gan ronne
            Boy loke thou let for no drede

            Alſo faſte as thou may ſpede
            Or the meale be done
            
               Behinde my backhouſe dore him ſet
            For they ſhall fayle of their men
            Tho the poke faſt be knet
            I ſweare by my crowne
            The litell boye ſtint nought
            Till the horſe was home brought
            Thereof wiſte the clerkes nought
            Forſothe as I you ſaie
            The clerkes their meale vp hent
            And out at the dore they went
            Alas they ſaid we be ſhent
            By god than the milner ſware
            Than get you him no mare
            For ſome theefe was of him ware
            And hath had him away
            The one clerke ſayd to the other
            Go we ſeke hym ſelfe brother
            Thou one way and I another
            Finde him if we maie,
            But euer they drede of the meale
            That the milner wolde therof ſteale
            The poke they bounde, and ſet on a ſeale
            And their horſe than ſought they.
            The mylner laughed them to ſcorne
            And great othes hath he ſworne
            If he might haue none of their corne
            He wolde haue of their meale,
            His daughter to the mille can fare
            And his diner to him bare
            And alſo faſte he tolde hir yare
            All euery deale:
            
               How two clerkes in the morne
            Brought with them a met of corne
            And euer they warned mee beforne
            That I ſhoulde none ſteale
            But do now doughter as I thee ſaie
            Go fet mee a ſhete I the pray
            And in faithe I will do ſaie
            To get of the meale
            For nothinge wolde let
            On a whyte ſhete he it ſet
            And moche floure he out bet
            And hole was the ſeale
            With two ſtaues in the ſtoure
            They dange theron whyles they myght doure
            Till they had a pecke of floure
            Forſothe as I you ſay
            They gathered it vp than anone
            And put it in a poke full ſoone
            And bade his daughter beare it home
            Euen the ryght way
            Then the clerkes had mykell thought
            For their horſe they ſought
            That they him finde might nought▪
            
            Of all that longe day
            And whan the night drewe nere
            At the mylle they met in fere
            And bothe they made a ſimple chere
            For their goodly hackeny
            That one clerke ſayd by god of might
            Me thinke our poke is waxen light
            I thinke it be not all a ryght
            
               That lyketh mee full yll
            My heed therto dare I lay
            That he hath ſtolen ſome away
            That other clarke ſayd▪ nay nay,
            The ſeale ſtandeth on ſtyl:
            They both did to the milner ſay
            Herberowe vs to night we thee pray
            And we wyll therfore well pay
            What ſo euer thou wyll
            For we dare not to the towne gone
            Tyll we bring our horſe hoine
            If we do by ſwete ſaynte Iohn
            We mon like it yll
            The mylner ſayd by goddes might
            I ſhall barborowe you to night
            And your ſupper ſhall be dight
            Right well if wee may
            There they bare their meale bitwene them two
            And home with the mylner dyd they go
            His wife welcomed them tho
            So dyd his doughter gay
            Aboute a fyre they were ſet
            And good ale was there fet
            And therwith they their mouthes wet
            And ſoone ſouped they
            At their ſupper as they made them glad
            That one clerke nyce countenaunce made
            And priuely on the maidens foote he treade
            And ſhe tourned awaie
            Whan they had eaten and made them glad
            The Milner his daughter bade
            
               Soone that a bed were made
            Alſo faſt as you maie,
            And make it by the ſide binke
            That the clarkes may therein winke
            And ſlepe till it be daie:
            For I will to my bedde win
            And if you here any din
            It is my man dothe come in
            Forſothe as I you ſaie,
            For he is in the towne at his warke
            Whan he dothe come in the hounde will bark
            This ment the milner by the clarke
            That helde his daughter gay
            By one ſide the clarke lay
            By the other ſide his wife and he I ſaie
            And for his doughter ſo gay
            An other bedde was dyght,
            In a chamber as I weene
            Was a wall them betweene
            And a cake ſhe made ſo clene
            Thereof the clarkes had a ſight:
            Of their owne meale it was
            Hir lemman befell ſuche a caſe
            Herken ſirs howe it was
            That he might not come that night,
            For to a faire was there beſide
            On his maiſters erande for to ride
            Erly in the morowe tide
            Before any day light.
            This one clarke ſtyll he lay
            And thought on this Dam

               What is mee beſt to do,
            For by god and by ſaint Mighell
            I thinke ſo on the damoſell
            I had muche leuer than I can tell
            That I might winne hir to:
            His brother ſaid this is nought
            Of my horſe I haue more thought
            By Ieſu that mee deere bought
            Howe we maie winne him to.
            Yet lie ſtill brother I the praie
            For come there what come maie
            At the dore I will aſſaie
            If it will vndoe,

               How two clarkes came thyther,
            Vpon the monday at morne
            And brought with them a met of of corne
            On a horſe them beforne
            And bothe they were full lither.
            For the one clarke ſtode at the ſpoute
            There as the meale ſhoulde come out
            That other went euer aboute
            And let vs of our pray,
            My father did ſee it might be none other
            He rowned vnto my brother
            And bade it ſhoulde be none other
            But lede their horſe away.
            My litell brother blinned nought
            Ere their horſe was home brought
            Like two fooles they haue him ſought
            All this longe daie,
            As we at our ſupper ſate
            That one clarke nice countenaunce made
            And priuelie on my foote he trade
            But euer I tourned a
                  •
               aie.
            Vpon the poke he ſet the ſeale
            For my father ſhoulde none ſteale
            yet we had of their meale
            And of their whiteſt floure,
            For nothinge wolde he let
            On a ſhete we it ſet
            And with two ſtaues it bet
            As longe as we might doure.
            And into our backhouſe their horſe is brought
            Therof wotte the clerkes nought
            
               The clarke laught and made good cheere
            Whan he of that myght heare
            That was well done my derling deere,
            By God my ſauiour:
            Both together a ſleepe they fell,
            Of the other clarke I wyll you tell
            And of the Milners wife howe it befell
            A whyle if you will abide,
            All waking ſtyl he laye
            And in his heart he thought aye
            My felowe hath a merie plaie
            In this euen tide.
            The Mylners wife did riſe water to make
            Stilly for the milner ſhould not wake
            The right way againe could ſhe not take,
            For the houſe was ſo wide.
            But a childe in a cradell laie
            At the beddes feete as I you ſaie
            Thereby ſhe knew the right waye
            Vnto hir beddes ſide,
            The clarke laie and harde ylke dele
            And of the cradell he wyſt well
            And if thou riſe by ſaint Michaell
            The cradell ſhal awaie:
            Againe he roſe or ſhe did ſleepe
            The clarke thereof tooke good keepe
            Out of his bedde ſoone he can creepe
            As faſt as euer he maie,
            For nothing woulde he let
            The cradell away he fet
            At his beddes ſide he it ſet,
            Forſothe as I you ſaye,
            
               The good wife came anone
            And tyll her huſbande can ſhe gone
            But cradell founde ſhe there none,
            Shee did ſeeke full faſt alwaie.
            All about ſhe groped faſt
            The cradell founde ſhee at the laſt
            The Milner did ſleepe full faſt
            And wiſt not of this warke,
            By the cradell that ſhe there fande,
            She had went it had bene hir huſbande
            She lyft vp the clothes with her hande
            And laide her downe by the clarke,
            Thus that one clarke laye by the wife
            That other by the daughter by my life
            Had the milner wiſt there had ben ſtrife
            For that nights warke,
            That one clarke waked and he dyd ſay
            That by the Milners daughter lay
            I muſt to a faire gone or it be day,
            And on he did his ſarke.
            Now I pray you my hinde Lēman free
            A gowne cloath then buie you mee
            And I ſweare ſo mote I thee,
            I wyll paye therefore:
            By Ieſu he ſaide my ſweeting
            I haue but three ſhylling
            That is but a lyttle thing
            But if I had more,
            Thus the clarke he made it towe
            The Damſell her forcer to her drawe
            By God ye ſhall haue inowe

            The righte waie can he take
            Downe by the wall,
            Till he came at his brothers bedde
            Than from the cradell away he yedde
            And anone away he fledde
            On the further ſide of the hall:
            Of his ſiluer he toke good keepe
            Downe by the milner can he creepe
            And wakened him out of his ſleepe
            And ſaid wilte thou heare a good game,
            For I haue had a merie night

            With that the milner did wake
            By god and by ſaint Ihon,
            
               And alſo ſhe hath mee tolde

            The milner was the more keene
            And gate the clarke downe.
            His wife waked anone right
            Out ſir ſhe ſaid the clerkes do fight
            The one will ſlee the other to night
            But if you parte them ſoone▪
            
            The clarke wakened and had great wonder
            But he durſte them not ſunder
            Full well he ſawe his felowe vnder

            That ſtil on grounde he laie.
            Thus the milners heed was broken
            The backhouſe faſte was broken
            Beleeue mee the clarkes braſte it open

            With all their things home they paſte
            Long or any day.

            Home vnto their Dame,
            Than was her heartfull light
            Whan ſhe ſawe her ſonne in ſight
            She thanked God with all her might
            That they were comen home,

            They gaue their mother without leaſing
            And ſence they tolde her of that thing
            They let for no blame,
            Their mother ſaide if ye doo right

            For if he may get you by goddes might

            Of that ſiluer the clarkes were faine
            The one clarke hied with all his maine

               Whan they were gone theſe ſcollers bothe
            I tell you plaine this milner was lothe
            And to his bedde againe he gothe

            All the daies of their life
            That he had ben ſo mad,
            And the daughter that was yonge
            Did often ſinge a ſory ſonge

            Though ſhe ſhould neuer the clothe ſee,
            The wenche ſhe was full proper and nyce

            Thus with ſhorte concluſion
            This milner through his abuſion
            Was brought to confuſion
            For all his falſehed iwis
            And ended his life full wretchedly
            In paine, care, and miſery

            He drew him nie, and then ſoftlie,
            at the doore he knocked.
            A Damſell, that heard him wel,
            there came and it vnlocked.
            The Fryar ſayd, God ſpeede fayre mayde,
            heere lodgeth ſuch a man:
            It is tolde mee, well ſir quoth ſhe,
            and if he do? what than?
            Quod he, maiſtreſſe, no harme doutleſſe,
            it longeth for our order.
            To hurt no man, but as we can,
            euery wyght to forder.
            With him truely, faine ſpeake would I,
            ſyr quod ſhe, by my faye:
            He is ſo ſicke, yee be not lyke,
            to ſpeake with him to daye.
            Quoth he fayre maye, yet I you pray,
            thus much at my deſyer:
            Vouchſafe to doo, as goe him too,
            and ſaye an Auſten Fryar,
            Woulde with him ſpeake, & maters breake,
            for his auayle certaine.
            Quod ſhee I wyl, ſtand ye heere ſtyll,
            tyll I come downe againe.
            Vppe is ſhee goe, and tolde him ſo:
            as ſhee was bode to ſaye.
            
               He miſtruſtinge, no maner thinge,
            ſaid mayden go thy waie.
            And fetche him hither, that we to gither:
            may talke a downe ſhe goth,
            And vp him brought, no harme ſhe thought,
            but it made ſome folke wroth.
            But this officer, this fained frier,
            whan he was come a lofte,
            He dopped than, and greet this man,
            religiouſly and ofte.
            And he againe, right glad and faine,
            tooke him thereby the hande:
            The friere than ſaid, ye be diſmaide▪
            
            with trouble I vnderſtande.
            In deede quod he, it hath with me,
            bene better than it is.
            Sir quod the frier, bee of good chere,
            ye ſhall yet after this.
            For chriſtes ſake, loke that ye take,
            no thought into your breſt,
            God maie tourne all, and ſo he ſhall,
            I truſt vnto the beſt.
            But I woulde nowe, comyn with you,
            in counſaile if you pleaſe,
            Or elles not, of maters that,
            ſhall ſet your heart at eaſe.
            Downe went the maide the marchaunt ſaid
            nowe ſaye on gentill frier,
            Of this tidinge, that ye me bringe,
            I long full ſore to heare.
            Whan there was none, but they alone,
            the frier with euell grace▪
            
            
               Said I reſt thee, come on with mee,
            and out he toke his mace:
            Thou ſhalte obey, come on thy way,
            I haue thee in my clouche▪
            
            Thou goeſt not hence, for all the pence,
            the mayre hath in his pouche.
            This marchaunt there, for wrath and feare.
            waringe well nighe wood:
            Saide horeſon the
                  •
               e, with a verie miſchefe,
            who hath taught thee thy good?
            And with his fiſt, vpon the liſt.
            he gaue him ſuche a blowe,
            That backewarde downe, almoſte in ſwoune,
            the frier is ouerthrowe.
            Yet was this man, well fearder than,
            leſt he the frier had ſlaine:
            Till with good rappes, and heuy clappes,
            he dawed him vp againe.
            The frier toke heart, and vp he ſtarte,
            and well he laide aboute,
            And ſo there gothe, bytwene them bothe,
            many a luſty cloute.
            They rent and tere, eche other heer,
            and claue togider faſt:
            Till with lugginge, halinge and tugginge,
            they fell downe bothe at laſt.
            Than on the grounde, to gether rounde,
            with many a heuy ſtroke.
            They roule and romble, they turne and tumble,
            lyke pygges do in a poke.
            So long aboue, they heaue and ſhoue,
            togither that at the laſt,
            
               The maide and the wife, to breake the ſtrife,
            hied them vpwarde faſt.
            And whan they ſee, the captaines lye,
            waltringe in the place,
            The friers hood, they pulled a good,
            a downe about his face.
            While he was blinde, the wenche behinde,
            lent him on the flore.
            Many a iole, about the nole,
            with a great battill dore.
            The wife came to it, and with her feete▪
            
            ſhe holpe to kepe him downe:
            And with her rocke, many a knocke,
            ſhe gaue him on the crowne.
            They laide his mace, about his face,
            that he was wode for paine,
            The frier frap, gate many a ſwap,
            till he was well nighe ſlaine.
            Vp they him lifte, and with euell thrifte,
            hedlong all the ſtaire:
            Downe they him threwe, and ſaid a dewe▪
            
            recommaunde vs to the mayre.
            The frier aroſe, but I ſuppoſe,
            amaſed was his hedde:
            He ſhoke his heres, and from great teres▪
            
            he thought him well a fledde.
            Quod he nowe loſt is all this coſt,
            we be neuer the nere:
            Ill mot he thee, that cauſed mee,
            to make my ſelfe a frier.
            Nowe maiſters all, an ende I ſhall,
            make there as I began.
            
               In any wiſe, I wolde auyſe,
            and councell euery man.
            His owne crafte vſe, all newe refuſe,
            and vtterlye let them gone.
            Playe not the frier, now make good cheere,
            and welcome euerychone.
            FINIS.
