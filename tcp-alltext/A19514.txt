            TO THE RIGHT Reuerend Father in God, Iames, Lord Bishop of Winton, Deane of his Maiesties Chappell-Royall, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Counsaile.
            
               MY LORD:
            
            
               SHortly after his Maiesties departure from Drumfreis, to Carleel, I posted away these two little Sermons, vnder hope they might serue for witnesses of my willing affection to haue attended his Maiestie in the rest of the iourney, if the condition, either of my person, which is infirme, or of the place, which was no longer pertinent to me, could so haue permitted. How they were miscarried, I know not, belike they haue taken in the Westerne way, wherein their father and fellowes had not been accustomed to walke before them:

alway, after long wandring, they returned backe againe vnto me, but not without good tydings; for the one of them told me, he was certainly informed, to find fauour with my Lord Duke of Lennox his Grace, who still kept in mind that Welcome, giuen to his Maiesty in the Royall Chappell of the Palace of Holy-roode-house, at his Maiesties comming in. The other seemed to mee no lesse confident that he would be countenanced by my Lord Marques of Buckingham, who did likewise remember the admonition giuen to the worthy Nobles of England; as also, that hearty Acclamation of the people, who seemed to powre out their hearts with their voices, and cryes, for his Maiesties preseruation in the Church of Drumfreis, at his Maiesties going out.
            Both these I easily beleeued, when I called to mind the continual, and constant kindnesse, which through long experience I had found of the one, and that rare humanity of the other, euident toward all, and whereof it pleased his Lordship when he was here, to giue me a speciall proofe. Yet could I not presume to present such base, and vnapparelled Pilgrimes to so Noble, and high Personages.
            
               Sure I am, if they could haue ouertaken that Reuerend, Graue, & most Learned Prelate, my Lord Bishop of Ely, they had not wanted a Patrone; for I knew from himselfe, that nothing comming from the B. of Candida Casa, would be v
                  •
               welcome to his Lordship for Amphibalus sake, harbored in Mona, by Crathlint King of Scots, and protected there, with the Christians that fled with him from the bloudy persecution of Dioclesian. But when I had considered all, I thought it most kindly, since they come from the Deane of his Maiesties Chappell here, they should take their course directly to your Lordship, Deane of his Highnesse Royall Chappell there. My Lord, they are Strangers; I trust your Lordship will vse them kindly; all the fauour I craue, is, that your Lordship would once bring them vnder his Maiesties eye, there to receiue their sentence, whether they shall be committed to the Presse, that they wander no more; or then returned home againe, vntill they gather further strength, to doe for themselues. So rests,
            
               
                  Your Lordships owne in Iesus Christ, W. B. of Galloway.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            HIS MAIESTIES COMMING IN.
            
               
                  PSAL. 121. VERS. 8.
                  The Lord shall preserue they going out, and thy comming in, from henceforth, and for euer.
                  My helpe is in the Name of the Lord.
               
            
            
               THis verse containes an Oracle or heauenly answer giuen from the great King IEHOVA,Summe of this Verse. to Dauid his Deputie-King in Canaan, and it commeth this Day to another King, the Successor of Dauid, and Deputie also of IEHOVA in Brittaine, bringing with it a heartie welcome, and a most sure promise of a safe-conduct to our Soueraigne in His comming in, and going out.
            
            
               Euthymius said of the one,
                  Dauid was the heart, the tongue, and penne of the great King. to wit, of Dauid, that he was Primi Regis, & cor, & lingua, calamus, the heart, the tongue, and the pen of the first King. And who can deny this in the owne sort competent to

our Soueraigne. A King whose heart hath proued indiuertible from God,How this is also competent to our Souereigne.

                  ec minis, nec muneribus à vera fide flectiposset: a King, whose tongue doth pleade the cause of God, that they who stand about him to minister vnto him, may dayly heare, and see Regem Philosophantem, & Philosephum regnantem: a King, whose pen, though it hath not penned Canonicall Scripture, & (that Canon was cōpleted by S. Iohn) yet hath it explained Canonical Scripture, and propagated to many Kings and Nations the knowledge of God his Eternal Truth, vnknown to thē before. The present Ageadmires it, the subsequent shal be forced to acknowledge it, there reigneth this day in Brittain, & long may he raign in it, a King, who in his own degree is also primi Regis & cor, & lingua, & calamus,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , commeth this comfortable promise of protection, The Lord shall preserue thy going out, and thy comming in, &.
            
            
               This verse is to be resolued in a promise.This verse, by some of the Diuines, is resolued in a Prayer, by others in a Promise, both agreeable to the analogie of Faith, but the second most consonant to the course of this Psalme: for in the first two verses, Dauid sendeth vp his Prayer to the Lord, in the remanent sixe, the Lord sends downe his answere to Dauid, full of comfortable promises, whereof this is the last, and hath in it these circumstances to be considered.
            
               Foure circumstances to bee con
                     ••
                  dered in this verse.First, who is it that makes the promise, the Lord. Next, to whom is the promise made, it lurkes in this word, thy. He who in the beginning of the Psalme

lifted vp his eyes to the Lord, protesting that his helpe came from him, who made the heauen, and the earth, receiues this answere, The Lord shall preserue thy comming, and thy going. Thirdly, the benefit promised, is preseruation. Last, the qualities of this preseruation; these are two-fold; First, it is totall, He shall preserue thee in all thy waies both comming and going. Next, it is perpetuall, From henceforth, and for euer shall the Lord preserue thee. Thus haue we the little body of this Text shortly anatomized, both the method and matter thereof explained.
            The first circumstance then is carried in the first word,First circumstance is, who makes the promise, to wit, the Lord. 1. Sam. 2.9. Mat. 10.30. 
               The Lord. This praise belongeth to the Lord, that He, and none but He preserueth such as are his: The Lord keepeth the feete of his Saints, said Anna the Mother of Samuel. Hee numbreth the haires of our head, said our Sauiour. O what a care! O what a vigilance is this! from the sole of our foote, to the haire of our head, doth the protection of the Lord ouershaddow vs.
                  Aug.
                
               Et si sic custodiuntur superflua tua, in quant à securitate est anima tua? And seeing the Lord hath such care of thy superfluities, that a haire of thy head fals not to the ground, but by his prouidence; what great care hath he of thy soule?
            And as this is the Lords praise,All the godly reserue to the Lord the praise of their preseruation. Psal. 91.11. that he preserueth his Saints, so they reserue it vnto him, and will not giue it to any other, they know hee hath giuen his Angels charge ouer them, to keepe them in all their waies, not for any neede he hath of them, but for our comfort.

Adrichom. descrip. Hierus.(yet as Elisha said to his seruant) Feare not, for they that be with vs, are moe, then they that bee with them.

There Dauid had his residence. In the highest part of it he had the strong sort of Sion, but the Towre wherein he trusted, was higher then it. Hee had a guard of Cherethites, and Pelethites, 
               2. Sam. 23.39. with seuen and thirtie valiant Worthies to attend his Royall person; these he vsed to serue him, but abused them not to trust in them.
                  Psal. 44.6. 
               I trusted not in my bow, nor my sword. Thou, Lord, sauest me from my aduersaries. Many a time all secondary helpes failed him: his sonne Absalom rose against him; his Counsellour Achitophel betrayed him; his Subiects forsooke him; the Ziphims discouered him; in his neede Nabal refused him; yea, his owne heart fainted in him: 
                  Psal. 73. Psal. 27.10. but (saies he) God, the portion of my soule, failes me neuer: though my Father and my Mother should forsake mee, the Lord will gather me vp. Nothing can secure that soule, 
                  Prou. 18. Ambros. They can neuer be secured, to whom the Lord is not a

                  uretie. which runnes not to the Name of the Lord, as vnto a strong Towre. Omnia timet, qui Vnum non timet: he feareth al things, who feares not One. Amōg many, let the Romane Monarch Tiberius, stand for an example: he wanted no worldly pillar that might vnderprop

him; yet because hee made not the Lord his refuge, he was neuer in surety, timeo incustoditos aditus, timco ipsos custodes: I feare, said he, the passages, which are not kept, yea, I feare them who are set to be keepers of me. But the soule which trusteth in the Lord, findes rest in him, and reioyces with Dauid,
               
                  Psal. 27.1. 
               The Lord is the strength of my soule, of whom shall l be afraid?
            
            But let vs stand a little here,What a great Maiestie the Lord, Ichoua is. and for our greater comfort consider what a Lord this is, who makes the promise: he is called in the Text, IEHOVA. This name the Iewes called nomen ineffabile. No maruell, the word it selfe is easily pronounced, the Maiestie named by it, is more than can be manifested, or perceiued, it imports Him to bee that onely true subsisting Lord, who hath his Being of himself, and giues Being to all things which are.Mysterie of the Trinitie to be reuerenced. Some presumptuous Spirits, out of their idle speculations, are bold to talke of the Trinitie, as they doe of their A.B.C. As if nothing were in the Diuine Maiestie, which their narrow braine could not comprehend, or the Lord were no more, then they conceiue him to be,

Cor. 4.This name IEHOVA wee finde it in holy Scripture sometime contracted, sometime enlarged: the Lord himselfe giues this to Moses for his name, I AM hath sent thee. Neither man nor Angell can in truth speake so; for man is a mutable creature, his life is but momentanie, and he liueth, so long as hee liueth, in a passing moment onely, one goes away to giue place vnto another, the moments which are past since his first mouing, returne not againe vnto him, & those which are to come, he cannot be said to liue in them. In this name I AM there are but two syllables; before a man can pronounce the second, hee is changed from that which he was, when he pronounced the first: how then can hee say

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . The learned Doctor Zanchius hath obserued, that this name IEHOVA noteth the Being of this true subsisting Lord, in respect of all times, Camets being a note of the time past, Holem of the time present, and Iod of the time to come; but wee haue this same Doctrine better warranted by this circumloquution of the holy Ghost; IEHOVA is the Lord, who was, who is, and who wilbe:
                  Bern. in Cantica Ser. 31. 
               Solus verè est qui non praeciditur à (fuit) nec expungitur ab (erit) fuit non tollit illi esse in aeternum, nec (crit) esse ab aeterno; None can be said to be, but hee of whom, when I say that he was, it takes not away that he is, and wilbe; and when I say that he wilbe, it takes not away that he was, and he is. No Angell, no man, no creature can claime this; it is a glory proper to the Lord.

               One generation passeth, and another generation succeedeth, but the earth remaines for euer. Much more doth he remaine, 
                  Heb. 1.11 12. who hath laid the foundation, and established the pillers thereof: The heavens shall waxe old, as doeth a garment, but thou, O Lord, art the same, and thy yeres shal not faile. 
               What a great comfort we haue in this, that our God, was, is, and wilbe. Math. 22.32. O what a great Lord is our God, and what a comfort haue wee in this, that he was, and he is, and he will be! Can that people be destroyed by death, whose God is the Lord? Hee is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing. In the mysticall body all the life is in the head: so long as the head keepes life, the body, yea, no member of the body can perish. Therefore said our Sauiour,

               
                  Iob. 14.
               Because I liue, ye shall liue also. Only let our care be to be found in Him: so shall we be sure of a happy being for euer and euer.
            
               The second circumstance: to whom is this promise made.The second circumstance points at the person to whom the promise is made, and it lurkes, as I said, in this word (thy.) In the beginning of the Psalme Dauid prayed vnto the Lord; and here the Lord answeres him with a promise of preseruation. The Prayer of Saints is not powred out in vaine:
                  Iam. 5.16. 
               it auaileth much, if it be feruent. It is a sweet gradation which our Sauiour vses to that woman of Samaria, 
                  Iohn. 4.10. 
               If thou knewst, thou wouldst aske, if thou askedst, I would giue.

                  oeli, That Prayer was the key of heauen: ascendit oratio, & discendit Dei miseratio.
               Prayer of Saints is neuer powred out in vaine. Prayer goes vp, and mercy comes downe. Neither can it be otherwise, for hee to whom we pray as to our King prayes in vs, as our Prophet, teaching vs to pray, and prayes for vs, as our Priest: Orat in nobis, vt Propheta, orat pro nobis, vt sacerdos, oratur à nobis, vt Rex. And hereof comes this efficacie of Prayer, that it is Deo sacrificium, Daemonibus flagellum, oranti subsidium: a sacrifice to God, a scourge to the Diuell, a subsidie and help to him that vses it.

It fareth euen so with a

Christian, when he is ouerwhelmed with the waters of many tribulations, then hee stretches out his Prayer on high, and drawes downe grace; which vpholds him that he lye not down vnder temptation, quod corpori est respiratio, id animae est oratio;

It is a common thing to see the earth watred by the heauens, but a rare thing to see heauen watred by the earth.1. Sam. 7.6. When lsrael fasted at Mizpeh, they drew water, to wit, out of the cisterne of their heart, and powred it out before the Lord. There is a showre that ascends and goeth vpward. When thou from a contrite, and melting heart, sendst vp teares to the Lord, as witnesses of they vnfained repentance, they fal not to the ground, 
                  Psal. 56.8. for the Lord gathers them in his bottell, then doth the earth water the heauen.A notable encouragement to Prayer. If thou wert (said Chrysostome) to labour a fruitfull land, wouldst thou spare seede vpon it? what then should wee doe

               The third circumstance presents vnto vs the benefit promised,The third Circumstance is of the benefite promised, to wit, Preseruation. to wit, preseruation: The Lord shall preserue. The word Shamar imports a most tender preseruation: from it comes Shemuroth, signifying the eye-lids,
                  Psal. 77.4. because they are the keepers of the eye, as the Lord is called in the verse preceding, Shomer Itshrael,
               
                  Psal. 121.4. the keeper of Israel. If the lids of the eye open, it is to let the eye see: if they close, it is to let it rest, at least to defend it, all their motion is for the good of the eye. O what a comfort is here! The Lord calleth his Church, The apple of his eye. Qui vos tangit, tangit pupillam oculi mei:
                  Zach. 2.8.
               The word imports, that as the lid of the eye couers the eye, so the Lord preserues his owne. he that touches you, touches the apple of mine eye: so deare and tender is his church vnto him, that he feeleth the least offence done vnto it. The Church is the apple of the Lords eye, and the Lord is the couering of it. O how well are they kept, whom the Keeper of Israel keepeth! The Lord was a buckler to Abraham,
               
                  Gen. 15.1. none of his enemies could harme him; for his buckler couered him throughly.

What the power of diuine preseruation is, neuer King, since the daies of Dauid, can witnes better thē our Soueraigne; the Lord hath made his Maiestie glorious by deliuerances,
                  Psal. 144.10.

from their most miserable master, that He was The man of God. Yet being loth to discouer his owne weakenesse, spake it in such a language as for the present they vnderstood not. Let therefore Romish Rabsache raile,Romish Rabsache, and his Tulipantic Frogs not to be feared. as he hath done, against the Lords Anointed, whom he hath set ouer vs; let his Emissaries spue out their venemous and blasphemous boastings, Leo

The Tulipantic Frogs haue plotted in powder, and laid subtill subterranean snares to accomplish the malice of their heart, but all in vaine, blessed be the Lord for it; for he hath preserued, and will preserue the comming, and the going of his owne Anointed.

            Secondly,For a remedy of our diffidence. it is for a remedy of our naturall diffidence: the Word of the Lord in it selfe is as sure when it is spoken, as when it is sworne; as sure spoken once, as when it is oftner repeated, yet is not the Lord content to speake onely, but to sweare also, nor to speake once, but often, one and the selfesame thing: The reason is shewed vs by the Apostle, that hereby he may declare to the heires of promise this stability of his counsell.
               
                  Heb. 6. Gen. 21.32. As Ioseph spake of Pharao his vision, It was doubled, because the thing is established by God, and God hasteth to performe it; so is it with euery Word of the Lord, when it is repeated, it is because it is established, and GOD hastens to performe it.

Next, it is perpetuall, from henceforth and for euer. Hilarius, and Arnobius expound this too strictly: Arnobius takes it this way: Custodit introitum tuum ad poenitentiam, & exitum tuum de corpore: Hee preserues thy comming into repentance, and thy going out of the body:

               Beside that which is common to all men, the office of a King is called A going in and out before the people. But to come neerer, beside both these, which are common vnto all men, here is a promise of protection to godly Kings in the doing of their office: for this comming in, and going out, is a Periphrasis familiarly vsed by the Spirit of God, to expresse the Royall function. I am now (said Moses) an hundreth and twenty yeere old, and can no more goe out and in before you: 
                     Deut. 31.2.
                that is, I can no more doe the Office of a Gouernour vnto you. And againe, when he prayed for Ioshua,
               
                  Numb. 27.17. 
               The Lord God of the Spirits of all flesh appoint a man to go in and out before the Congregation, that they be not as sheepe without a Shepheard. This same is more cleere out of that Prayer of Salomon:1. King. 3.7. 
               I am but young, and know not how to goe in and out. Now what he meanes by this, he expounds himselfe: Giue to thy seruant an vnderstanding heart, that I may discerne betweene good and bad, and may iudge thy people. So that to goe out and in before the people, is to iudge the people rightly, and to discerne betweene the good and the euill.
            
               A godly and religious Ruler is a great blessing to a people.Of this first may appeare, what a great blessing of God a religious Ruler is, walking himselfe in the way of righteousnesse, and leading his people both by Law, and example to follow him: when hee so rules his Subiects, as onely caring how to make them subiects vnto God.

Howeuer it be, hereby properly is figured the restlesse care of conscientious Kings. They may lye (as one sayes) in beds of Iuory, trimmed with carpets of Egypt, but ouer-hanged with curtaines of care: their mindes are in a continuall motion day and night, how to go in, and out before their people. Neither is it possible that any man could be sufficient for so laborious and hard a charge:The Royall Office can not be borne out, without the Royal vnction. for it is ars artium regere hominem, were not as the calling is singular, so it hath a singular vnction accompanying it. Presumptuous men, out of their ignorant mindes, may thinke themselues fit enough for the highest places. But let men beware to vsurpe; for a Royall office without the Royall vnction, is a burden that will beare downe and oppresse the stoutest, the strongest, and the wisest.A warning to vsurpers of the Royall calling.

But a good King is like that good Iehosaphat, of whom it is written, that he went and returned through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, setting Iudges in the Land, City by City, and bringing home againe to the Lord God of their Fathers, such as had falne from him,

                  Psal. 2.8. and it is now sixteen hundred yeeres since the Lord began to performe it: for in the sixscore & foure yeere of our Lord, Donald King of Scots, and Lucius King of South Brittaine embraced the Christian faith;The Churches of Scotland and England receiued not the Christian faith from Rome.
                None of the Churches of this Ile, neither that in the South, nor that in the North, receiued the Faith from the Church of Rome. It is true indeede, at the desire of King Lucius, there was sent to him from the Bishop of Rome, Damianus and Fugatianus

               This Psalme hath two Prayers.In this Psalme are two Prayers; one for the Church, that the Shepheard of Israel, who sits betweene  the Cherubins, would mercifully looke on her misery,For the Church. and bring againe her captiuity. The other  is a Prayer for such as the Lord had appointed to be the instruments of her deliuerance,For the instruments of her diliuerance, and these are of two sorts. either spirituall, or temporall. Principally it is a Prayer for the comming of the MESSIAH, the true, and  great Redeemer of his people; and so Saint Iero

               Fiat manus tua super filium hominis, quem confirmasti tibi, id est, ipsum Mediatorem, & Saluatorem nostrum. Secondarily, it is a Prayer for all Typicall and Temporall redeemers, whome  this people expected, for perfiting their promised deliuerance,The typicall and temporall Redeemers thereof, Cyrus, Zerubb

               These two agree well together.The one of these is not repugnant to the other, nay, they agree very wel together, as the Type, and the Truth. Such as were spirituall and truely religious among that people, rested not in the temporall

promises, which were made vnto them, but by them ascended vp, and layd hold on the spirituall. Abraham contented not with earthly Canaan,
               
                  Heb. 11 9.10. hee dwelt in it, as in a strange countrey: for hee looked for a better. And heere (no doubt) the godly Iewes do in such sort pray for their deliuerance from Babel, that their desire looketh vp with an higher eye, for their redemption from sinne and Sathan by Iesus Christ.

                  Galat. 4 19. they shall not rest, nor be deliuered, till by his second appearance he perfit them; and as to them who were before the Incarnation, sure it is, so soone as the Messia was promised, the Church by faith conceiued him, she trauelled, crying for him by praier, as earnestly desirous to see him, as a woman desires in due time to see the birth of her wombe, & at length by patiēce in the fulnes of time she broght him out Abraham saw his day a far off, & reioyced that a childe was to be borne vnto him, in whom all Nations of the earth should be blessed. And (which is

the point) the godly in this verse long for him,But the neerer the time of his exhibition came, the more his Saints looked for him. and pray for his Comming, and the neerer the time drew, wherein he was promised to be exhibited, the more desirous were they to see him. All the faithfull of that age looked for Redemption in Israel. Of that number was Ioseph of Arimathea, hee waited for the Kingdome of God,
               
                  Luke 2.38. also Anna and Simeon waited for the consolation of Israel, then was Simcon content to die, when he got in his armes the promised seede of the woman, and saw with his eyes the saluation of the Lord. And thus haue we the first and principall meaning of this praier, which the Church maketh for the Messia.

Doubtlesse this is a strong bulwarke of our faith, for since we see that the sonne of God is become the sonne of man, clothed with all the infirmities of our nature, except sinne, since wee see the God of glorie humbled to the ignominie of the crosse, why shall we doubt that the sonnes of men, shall also be made the sonnes of God, and that these vile bodies of ours shall bee changed and fashioned like vnto the glorious body of Christ,

Euerie way the mighty strength of our strong Redeemer is to be admired, but specially his conquest by suffering, there did appeare the weaknesse of God stronger then man; yea, then all these Principalities, powers,

and spirituall wickednesse,
               There was neuer such a work committed to Angel or man, as that which was laid on Iesus. that were opposite to him.
            It was indeed an exceeding great worke, which committed to our Mediatour, The man lesus, and therefore required a speciall vnction to make him strong vnto it. All the Angels of heauen, all the men on earth were not able to haue wrought that worke. Such a Law was neuer imponed to man nor Angell, as was imponed to lesus, by his his Fathers ordination; & willingly accepted by himselfe.
            This was the Law of a Redeemer,The Law of a Redeemer was enioyned to him, which requires more, then the Law morall. wherewith Christ was charged, and none but hee, more many manner of wayes, then the Law morall whereunto all are subiect. The morall Law had two tables, the first commanding the perfit loue of God; the next commanding to loue our neighbour as our selues. The Redeemers Law hath also two parts,As the Law moral had two tables, so hath the Law of the Redeemer two parts. both of them commanding much more, then is commanded by the morall, the first part of the Redeemers law lookes vp to his Father, the second lookes downe to his brethren. In the first this commandement was giuen him,The first looks vp to his father and binds him to vindicate the glory of his fathers iustice & mercy. Thou must vindicate the  glory of thy fathers mercy and iustice. If man bee not punished, what shall become of the glorie of my iustice, and if all men perish vnder that wrath, which is due to their transgression, what shall become of the glory of my mercie. The Lord Iesus hath in wonderfull manner preserued them both, for in him the inuiolable strictnesse of his Fathers iustice hath beene manifested, in that he spared not his own sonne, bearing the burden of our transgression, many fearefull examples of diuine iustice hath been

seene since the beginning of the world, but neuer one like vnto this. And many great mercies in all ages hath hee shewed to his seruants, Noah in the arke, Lot in Zoar, Israel beyond the red sea, may stand for examples, but neuer a mercy like this was manifested in the world, that the Lord gaue his onely begotten to the death, that such as beleeue in him might haue eternall life. There was the riches of the glory of his mercy wonderfully declared. Thus did the Lord fulfill the commandement of the law of a Redeemer, and preserue the glory both of his fathers iustice and mercy.
            
               
               The second lookes' downe to hisbrethren, & bindes him to vindicate them from all their enemies.The other part of the law respected his brethren, concerning whom, this commandement was giuen him, thou must loue thy brethren, not as thy selfe onely, but more then thy selfe, thou shalt purchase them life by thine owne death, thou shalt saue them who haue lost themselues, thou shalt redeeme their inheritance which they haue solde without a price, and as their neerest kinsman, and first-borne of thy fathers familie (according as thou art bound) thou shalt pursue the murtherer that slue him, to wit, the Diuell, he is without all citie of refuge, reuenge thou their bloud vpō him; & like another Abraham, thou must bring home againe Lot out of the hands of that Tyrant Chedarlaomer, all this the Lord Iesus powerfully performed, for the father fortified him, and made him strong to this worke for himselfe▪ And thus haue wee seene how these words containe a prayer for the comming of Iesus Christ, the great and true Redeemer of his Church.

For a King called of God to rule his people, and set ouer them, not in wrath as the Kings of Israel, Ieroboam and his successours were, of whom spake the Lord by Hosea,
               Now it is competent also to secondary instruments raised by God for the good of his Church. 
               dedi illis regem in surore meo, but a King set ouer a people in mercie, as Dauid and Salomon, because the Lord hath loued his people. Such a King no doubt is a sonne of the Lords right hand, and for three causes so called; first, blessed art thou ô land, when thy King is the sonne of Nobles, and what greater Nobility then to be the sonne of Gods right hand,For good Kings are sons of Gods right hand, otherwise then common Christians are. not onely in regard of his personall regeneration and adoption, which way all Christians are the sonnes of God; but also in regard of that speciall vnction proper to the royall calling, whereby God separates him, and sets him vp as his Deputy, to rule others. Secondly, a good King is so called for that speciall and maruellous care the Lord hath of him, to preserue and keepe him in most desperate dangers, Many deliuerances giues the Lord to his annoynted, and rescueth his seruant Dauid from the hurtfull sword. As the Lord hath set him vp for himselfe, so in speciall manner hee preserues him by himselfe. And thirdly, a good King is called a sonne of Gods right hand,And it agrees also to them that God ha
                     •
                  h made them strong for himselfe. because his heart is rightly set to doe good in his calling, like Dauid, Ezechia, and Iosia.
            
            The other part of the description agrees also very well vnto him, for the speciall and royall vnction of

such a King as I haue spoken of, makes him strong for the Lord, and heere are two things; first, thou hast made him strong, next thou hast made him strong for thy selfe.
               All strength & dignity is from the Lord. 1 Sam. 2. Psal. 144. All superexcellencie of strength and dignity is from the Lord, the Lord brings low and exalts (said Anna the mother of Samuel) To come to preferment is neither from the East, nor from the West, but from the Lord. Yet sure it is, all whom the Lord maketh strong are not made strong for himselfe.But not alway vsed for the Lord. There are many who abuse (against the Lord) the strength, authority, and honour, which they haue receiued from the Lord. The Princes of Zoan are fooles, and the Princes of Noph are deceiued, such was Pharaoh, of whom sayd the Lord, I haue raised thee vp, that I may shew my power vpon thee; such were the Apostate Israelites,
                  Ierem.

Let them be assured, if they will not doe his will out of louing and humble obedience, God shall doe his will vpon them out of his iustice and power,Otherwise God will doe for himselfe, but against them. hee shall roll them from their station, and turne their glory into shame, Sic fiet ex

            But happy are they,Happy are they who returne to the Lord that which they haue receiued from him. who cast downe their crownes at the feet of the Lord, and returne vnto him all that they haue receiued from him, vsing for the Lord, that strength, honour, and authoritie, which they haue gotten from the Lord, these are the sonnes of his right hand, labouring to honour him who hath honoured them,
                  Ezech. 34.26. and these the Lord keepeth as a signet on his hand, vpon these shall be raine of blessings. The eye of the Lord shall watch ouer them for good, to protect and defend them in all their necessities. As they are for the Lord, so is the Lord for them, to performe to them that which he promised to DAVID,
                  Psal. 89 21.22.23. 
               Mine hand shall bee established with him, and mine arme shall strengthen him, the enemie shall not oppresse him, neither shall the wicked hurt him, but I will destroy his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. What heere is plainely promised, hath beene particularly performed to your Maiesty, compare the oracle with your owne experience, and then the Lord his constant and louing

kindnes felt in by-gone times, shal animate & incourage your Highnes still to walk before the Lord in the vprightnes of your heart,
                  Psal. 18.25. 
               for with the vpright man, the Lord wil shew himself vpright. I need to speak no more of this point to a Prince of such vnderstanding, I am sure out of these places, God hath spoken to your hart, & your royall hart hath answered him.

               O Lord I beseech thee, let thy hand be on me, and my fathers house, and not on thy people for their destruction. And againe, when Absalom rebelled against his father King Dauid, the people interponed their liues for their King,2 Sam. 18.3. they would not let him goe out to the battell, they accounted him the light of Israel, more worthy to be preserued, then many thousands of them.
            
            But now must I contract my selfe;The conclusion, wherein this prayer is applied to

                  ur Soueraigne. Since all other things requisite for your Maiesties iourney, are in readinesse, attending your Highnesse forth comming, it is also time that our prayer should betake her to her wings, and let goe to her flight, to accompanie your Maiestie, wheresoeuer yee goe. As I said in the beginning, so now say I in the end, in the name of all your Highnesse subiects of this

Kingdome: Since our hands cannot be with your Highnesse, to waite on, and serue your Maiestie, as our hearts would, The hand of the Lord be with you. That hand which preserued you in the wombe of your Mother, and brought your Highnesse safely into this world. That hand of the Lord which made your armes strong, to wrestle with the Gowrian traitor, before the hands of your seruants came neere you. That hand of the Lord, which deliuered your Maiestie from that abominable powder treason, and first reuealed to your selfe the counsell of your enemies. In a word, That hand of the Lord, which hath made your Maiestie glorious by many deliuerances, that same hand of the Lord be with your Maiestie, in this iourney and for euer.
            
               Ancient Israelites vsed it for their Rulers, and we should vse it for our King.The ancient Israelites vsed this prayer, for Cyrus, Nehemiah, Zerubabel, & such others, that were to be the instruments of their comfort, before euer they receiued any comfort from them; how much more should we vse it for your Highnesse, since we doe so abundantly enioy the fruits of your Highnesse most happy gouernment. For your Maiestie hath bin vnto vs an other Cyrus: when he came to the Kingdome, then came deliuerance to Israel from their seauentie yeeres bondage in ancient Babel; and with your Maiesties comming into the world to enioy these Scepters, wherevnto your Highnesse was borne a lineall and lawfull heire, then came our deliuerance from mysticall Babell.

                  THE LORD GRANT ME NO LONGER TO LIVE, NOR MY HEART BE SET TO ADVANCE THE GLORY OF GOD, AND TO PROCVRE THE GOOD OF HIS CHVRCH.

one, easie to be discerned. And for this cause I haue heard sundry of their ancient men blesse the Lord, for that he had sent the light of his Gospell among them to illuminate them, protesting that without it, they had died in most pitifull ignorance.
            The other fruit of singular peace is so apparant  to you all,For singular peace they enioy now being deliuered from their oppressors. that I neede not to point at it. Yee who stand here in great multitudes, beare witnes your selues before the Lord his Anointed. Tell as the truth is: Are yee troubled now with any forayes in the night? Are yee wakened from your rest by the Alarum, or sound of the drumme? Is there crying now for armour to represse the incursion of robbers? Doe yee not sit peaceably euery one of you in your owne houses without molestation of the oppressor? May ye not now, as the prouerbe is, porrectis dormire pedibus, in respect of securitie sleepe soundly? Is not that promise made by the Lord, accomplished now,

What cause haue yee then for this to blesse the Lord your God, and this happy King, whom he hath set ouer vs, and who this day sitteth before you, by whole fatherly care we enioy this quiet, and peaceable life.

            And as to you,A warning to his Maiesties Cubiculars and Domestiques. who haue that hap and honour beyond others, to bee his Maiesties Cubiculars and Domestickes, consider with your selues, what is the weight of your charge, and how the place, wherevnto, aboue others, otherwise not your inferiors, yee are promoted, bindes you to a daily tribute of daily vigilance, and attention. Remember that

word, which Dauid cried to Abner, for a rebuke to him and the rest of Sauls seruants, because they were sleeping when their master was in danger of his life by Abishai, if Dauid had not stayed him, ye are all (said he) worthy to die, because yee haue not kept your Master the Lords annoynted. If they were thus threatned, and most iustly, because they were remisse and carelesse in conseruation, euen of an euill King; what a sinne is it to be negligent in attending such a King as God hath giuen vs, it cannot but procure heauy iudgements, both from God and man. But we perswade our selues the best things of you, that conscience more then commodity, will stirre you vp to be faithfull in that calling,
                  Coloss. 3.22. 
               not with eye-seruice, as men pleasers,; but in singlenesse of heart, fearing God.
            
            Alwayes since the surest safty of Kings, is the protection of Iehoua, for his name is a strong tower, and the righteous runne vnto it; Sir, let him euer be, as you haue found him your rock and refuge. Continue still in that resolution of King Dauid, 
                     Psal. 101.3. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes, I hate the worke of them that fall away, it shall not cleane vnto me, so shall the word which Amasa (from the Spirit of the Lord) spake vnto Dauid, be established to your Maiestie; 1 Chro. 12.18. 
               Peace, peace be vnto thee, and peace be vnto thy helpers, for thy God helpeth thee. To this effect, that we may end, wee will now againe turne vs to our prayers, from which we shall neuer turne so long as we liue, and yet I am still stayed, or rather forced to stay, I would make an end, but am pearced with the sorrowfull looks of this people, who desire no ending,

not so much for delight of any thing they heare from me, as for that which they see in your Maiesty, they cannot bee satiate in looking to your face, the shorter time they haue to behold it, the stronger is their affection. O how hardly comport they to part with their Soueraigne. But deere Soueraigne, let it not be offensiue to your Maiesty, that you are compassed heere with an assembly of mourners, whose faces are watred with ouerflowing teares of their heart. Can they part with their Prince without sorrow? Can they want the light of their eyes, and breath of their nostrils, and not lament for it?
            Yet what speake I of wanting? bee of comfort, good peole, wee shall not want him, wee cannot want him, God hauing now so enlarged his royall armes, that they can reach from one end of the Isle to the other, to be at vs, to succour and helpe vs, as we neede them. Let vs therefore moderate our mourning, let our passions giue place to his royall pleasure, let our hearts with joy and cheerefulnesse send vp these our prayers. The hand of the Lord be with our most Gracious Soueraigne, the name of the God of Iacob defend him.
               
                  Psal. 20.1. The Lord bee to your Maiesty, as he was to Abraham, a buckler in this life, and your exceeding great reward in the life to come.
