            To the Reader.
            
               HEre haſt thou gentle Reader, a briefe and compendious methode of Chirurgerie, compiled by a moſt excellent Doctor, in maner of a Dialogue, wherein thou maiſt learne with eaſe the curation both of VVoundes and Vlcers, the vertue and operation of diuers Hearbes, with their preparations for Oyle, with extracting of diuers Oyles, moſt neceſſarie and profitable for all true and faithfull profeſſors in the Art of Chirurgery. And although it was not meant at the firſt, to be publiſhed vnto the view of the world, but only for mine owne priuate practiſe; yet when I remembred that ſaying of Cicero, that we are not onlie borne to profite our ſelues, but our countrie, parentes, and friends. I therefore thought it good to publiſh it for the benefite of euerie one that is deſirous of the Arte. And the rather mooued thereunto, becauſe I ſee manie that are profeſſors, and allowed in their practiſe, and yet are ſcarſe able to define of a ſimple Wound of which ſort the worlde is too full, and poore patientes buy their practiſe at too deere a price: But I leaue them to bee more carefull both in ſtudie and practiſe. And ſhal requeſt thee (gentle Reader) that whereas this booke is not altogether without imperfections and blemiſhes, yet if thou curteouſlie and friendlie accept of it at this time, it may cauſe the ſame hereafter for thy further commoditie to be ſcoured, and better amended.
            
               Farewell.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            A briefe and eaſie Practiſe of Chirurgery of Cornelius Shilander.
            
               
                  The first Lecture. Of the Definition of Chirurgerie, and the operation of a Chirurgian.
               
                  Doctor.
                  GOe to Chirurgian, tell me what is Chirurgerie?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Chirurgerie is a right orderly taking away of affectes beſides Nature, by inciſion or ſetting together, and alſo a healing of Woundes and Vlcers.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Right: but why ſay you by inciſion and ioyning togither.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  In this Arte, there are two partes, Syntheſis and Analyſis: that is, Compoſition, and Reſolution. By Compoſition Limmes diſioynted are ſetled into their former ſeate. But by Analyſis or Reſolution thinges that were ioyned are diuided as commeth to paſſe in Apoſtumes and ruptured or burſten Bones.
               
               
                  
                  Doctor.
                  I perceiue you doe briefly touch the two principall partes of Chirurgerie: but further, how doth the Chirurgian cure or heale, where Nature of Hipocrates is ſaid to bee the Phyſition or healer of diſeaſes:
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  That commeth to paſſe in a diuerſe kind of cauſe: For Nature alone is the efficient cauſe of curing, and the Chirurgian is the miniſtring or keeping cauſe, for he miniſtreth Medicines: and to the end Nature may better accompliſh her operation, he preſerueth her from the iniurie or hurt of the aire.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  I know Appollo watereth, but Nature it is that giues the encreaſe: But what is this Methodicall or right orderlie taking away, whereof you make mention?
               
               
                  Chirurgion.
                  That firſt we digeſt the matter of the Woundes or Vlcers: And ſecondarilie, that we mundifie or cleanſe the ſame being digeſted or concocted.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Wherefore, I pray you?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Becauſe it behooueth to Medicine to mooue thinges that are ripe or concocted: not alſo the rawe and vndigeſted, as it is contained in the Aphoriſme.
                  
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  How ſhal we at length euacuate or voyd out the matter digeſted?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  By Vnguents or Emplaiſters on the more declining or lower part: For thoſe thinges that you muſt drawe foorth, ought to be deriued or drawne whether they ſhal ſeeme moſt chieflie to encline.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Is this then the perfect method of Chirurgians?
               
               
                  
                  Chirurgian.
                  Not at all: but of each ones own Method, we ſhall ſpeak in their proper Lectures.
               
            
            
               The ſecond Lecture. Of the Difference of Woundes, and of their curing.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  WHat is a Wound?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  ¶¶¶A Wound is a Solution of the continuitie, bloudy and freſh or new, viz. latelie made.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What is the cauſe of the ſolution of continuitie?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Inciſion or cutting, which is made with a ſword, knife, or ſuch like weapon. Sometimes contuſion or bruiſing, which is made by things blunt, as is a ſtone, club, timber, &c. And alſo perforation, boaring or thruſting, which is done with weapons, as a Dart, Launce, or other like ſharp pointed thing.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Is not the methode of curing all theſe alike.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Yes trulie.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  I pray you ſhew it.
               
               
                  Chirurgian
                  The wound being offered to cure, the blood is not forthwith to be ſtopped, but ſuffered to iſſue foorth by little and little, till the boyling heat of the blood cauſed of anger, or ſome great trouble of mind, be quieted or calmed.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  
                     Thinke you then that the vntimely ſtopping of the blood may breed annoyance?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Yes marie: for by Wounds are things hurtfull purged out, euen in a maner, as by Phlebotomy or cutting of a vain.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  In the meane time whiles the blood iſſueth out from the wounded perſon, what muſt be giuen him being angred or ſorely mooued.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Thoſe thinges that are woont to quench the hotneſſe and Ebulation of the bloud, ſuch as are accuſtomed of the Phyſitions to be preſcribed.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  And what is that?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  The Gumme of Elennium decocted in Rhenniſh wine.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Trulie that Gumme is marueillous, for it digeſteth, mundifieth, and incarnates, and that ſpecially in wounds of the head.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  So it is that in manie green Wounds, Chirurgians are found that vſe this alone, to whome all things ſucceed according to their deſire.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  I pray you let me heare the compoſition of Emplaſtrum Sticticum, as you make it.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  It is compounded in this maner.

                  Let them be boyled to a Conſiſtance,But note, the Amoniac. Bdell. Galbanum, and Oppon. being brayed, ought firſt to be ſteiped in Vinigre for a naturall day, and after being diſſolued at a ſoft fire, muſt be ſtrain'd out.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Very well: That Emplaſt. (ſo God loue mee) is marueilous both for all Woundes and Vlcers.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Without doubt it is moſt effectual: But note, the wound is to be dreſſed euery day twiſe: to wit, the twelfth hower after the applying.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Why ſo?
               
               
                  Chirurgian
                  The vertue thereof vaniſheth away, if it ſticke any longer to the Wound.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  How ſhall we incarnate the Wound?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  By the only applying of this Emplaſter, the effect wherof is woonderfull, as well in incarnating, as in digeſting and in mundifying.
               
            
            
               
               The third Lecture Of ſtitching of the lippes of Woundes.
               
                  Doctor.
                  IS ſtitching in wounds vnprofitable then.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  If the lippes may by Emplaſters be vnited, it is vnprofitable, if not it is profitable.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  Geue the reaſon therefore.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  A Chirurgian ſhould bee a follower or Conterſector of Nature, but he followes not Nature, while hee ſtitcheth together the vtter ſurface with a thredded needle:Note. for ſhee beginneth her glewing or ioyning of partes together at the inner partes, and ſo proceedeth leaſurerly, till ſhe be come to the extremitie or outmoſt part of the wound.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Is not this manner of curing obſerued of our greene-wound Chirurgians?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  No indeed: for they ſtitch together the vtter parts, and leaue a concauitie or hollow place, wherein the bloud contained is corrupted, for one Wound they make ten: wherupon if any of the Sinewes be hurt with the needle, good God, what griefe and what bitter paine enſueth.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Cure they not rightly then?
               
               
                  
                  Chirurgian.
                  They cure rightly in ſooth: but it would more proſperouſly ſucceed, if they vſed ſticeicke plaiſters.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  I would faine heare of you their methode in curing.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Being called to a perſon that is hurt, they by and by with a thred draw together the lippes of the Wounde, an Orifice left beneath, whereby excrements may be purged: the white of an Egge beaten they take, on a light ſtuffe, they put it on, leauing it ſo for a day naturall.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Right: For this ſtops the fluxe of bloud, aſſwageth the paine, and keepeth backe Apoſtemation and Inflammation: But theſe matters finiſhed, doth all the cauſe want perill?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  No indeed: Howbeit if the ſame happens without pricking of the Sinew, if Feuers, Spaſmes, or other accidentes doe not ſpring of vntimely ſtopping the blood, the chiefe part of the labour is taken away.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  I beleeue verilie hee that hath well begun hath halfe done: but how proceed you the next day after?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.

                  The Gum of Elenium Mathiolus ſaith is a moſt excellent medicine in the fracture of the Cranium or Braine pan, which like fire, not onlie conglutinateth, but alſo mundifieth and is incarnatiue.

                  Doctor.
                  IN Woundes comming of Contuſion or bruiſing, is the way of proceeding all one and the ſame?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Not altogether: for leaſt any filth of ſtone or Wood ſticke in them, they are firſt to be waſhed with cenuenient liquor.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  With what liquor.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  With the decoction of Wine, of Mirrhe, and then further, the way of curing is all one with the former, the lippes ioyned together, the Wound is to bee emplaſtred with the white of an Egge: the next day after, it is gentlie to bee annoynted with the Eum of Elenium. And thereupon Baſilicon Magiſtrale is to be applyed, as we haue ſaid.

                  Doctor.
                  BY what method are Woundes cured wherein weapons thruſt doe ſticke ſtill.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Before all thinges the weapons are to bee drawne out, and if to the deepneſſe of the Wound there fal out a ſtraight Orific. the Wound muſt be enlarged, and the cure begun, as is ſaid, with Gum Elenium and Baſilicon Magiſtrale.
                  
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What if the Wound may not be enlarged?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Then we vſe a lotion of Wine, Mirrhe, and ſalte boyled which iniected with a Syring, purgeth out the corrupt matter, but the member ought to be placed downward, to the end it may the more eaſilie iſſue out.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  I vnderſtand: but how may you drawe out weapons,

that are hoooked or forked, without endamaging the vaines and Artiers.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Drawing forth is by drawing to, that belongeth to weapons of round and long making, or is done by thruſting from or puſhing further: by this meanes weapons with barbed heades are drawne out, for when they cannot bee drawne backe, they muſt needs be thruſt out on the contrarie ſide.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What if they may not be thruſt out?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  The Wound then muſt ſuddenly be made wider: For in caſes to make delay is nothing ſafe, or we muſt vſe an hollow and round inſtrument, which may containe in it ſelfe the foreſaid barbes deuided afore from the fleſh.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  All things deuiſed wittily ynough: But if the weapons ſticke in the bones, how muſt a man worke.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Let the place be opened with a three cornered inciſion, and let the Tripan be ſo ſet to, that in the compaſſe of the Arrowe the bone it ſelfe may be bored with deepe boaring: For moſt eaſilie then with inſtrumentes they with the bone together will be plucked out.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Truelie I confeſſe this to bee true, ſo the Weapon be not in ſome more noble part of the bodie: But if by reaſon of the Vaines, and Artiers, and Sinewes, the Wound may not be enlarged, or Tripan vſed, what ſhould be done then?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  In this & their like, a man muſt proceed with diſgeſtiues

                  Doe you beleeue that.

                  Chirurgian.
                  The bloud after it hath moderatelie iſſued out of the Wound, as is aboue ſaid, muſt be ſtayed, either by ſtitching, with the application of an Egge, or Sticticke Emplaſter: An Orific. left in the lower part, by which way the excrements may be purged out.

                  If it be without hurt of the Skull, wee Emplaſter it with the White of an Egge, and the next day doe annoynt the lippes (as is ſaid afore) with applying the plaſter of Gum Elenium, or of Betonie,

                  If that be done without ſolution of the fleſh, ſo that inwardly there be no rough ſharpneſſe of the bones, we vſe reſoluing and drying medicines, wherby the moyſture of blood between the ſkul & Dura mater may be reſolued & dried vp.

                  Chirurgian.
                  Yes vſe it, but in two caſes only.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What I pray you?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  While the pricking of Dura mater. by the Aſperities of the ſkull is felt, or while a peece of the bone ſtickes between the ſkull and Dura mater. For wheras theſe may not be concocted by the ayde neither of Nature, nor of medicine, the adminiſtring of the Tripan is requiſite.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  When muſt it be Tripaned?
               
               
                  Chirurgian
                  Sometimes the firſt day, ſometimes the ſecond, and ſometimes the third, according as the accidentes are grieuous or light.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  You ſay true: But the Skull opened, what harme ſhall the Dura mater. ſuffer of the iniurie of the aire.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  That this may be auoyded, we apply the Tripan in an hot place, cloſed vpon euery ſide, and the Aſperities or ſharp pricking ſcalles ſo ſoone as may be we take away. Then hot honey of Roſ. poured in, with Cotten we fill the emptie place and liue thereupon put, we ſtop vp the wound, and in the end with the Vnguent of Gum Elenium, and Emplaſter of Betonie thereon ſet, we heale the griefe.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What, is the cure finiſhed ſo?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Doubtleſſe ſo that the Ligature be daylie renewed, and due order of diet obſerued, the member being ſaued from Flegmon or inflammatios of blood.

                  Chirurgian.
                  In this the way of curing is like the former, ſo as they pierce not.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  No: I ſpeake of piercing Woundes.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Theſe are dangerous, yet if they admit or abide cure this way it ſhall be done: Let the wounded partie lie groueling on the bed, to the end by little and little may iſſue from the region of the ſtomacke to the outer partes, ſuch ſuperfluous ſtuffe as ought to be expelled, neither is the bloud forthwith to be ſtopped, ſo as the fluxe be not too great.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  What then afterwards?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  A fine Flamula dipped in Gum of Elenium, or the Reſin of Firre, with a little of the marrow of a Calfe, and Cumfry rootes is to be put in, and the white of an Egge is to be laid thereon, (as we ſaid before) or the Stictick Plaiſter deſcribed of vs.

                  The cure of Wounds of the bellie without hurt of the Inteſtines or guttes is eaſie, for their way of curing is al one with the former.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  How doe ye know the Guttes to be wounded?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  For that the ordure doth often void out, and the guttes ſtrent out with the Calle.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  The guttes hurt, is there any hope of health?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  If a ſmall Gut be hurt, or if through the back part of the Gut commeth, where the ſtore of ſinewes is, it is deadly: but if the great guttes be wounded, becauſe they conſiſt of fleſhy ſubſtance, a man muſt hope well of the wounded perſon.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  How do you know whether the ſmall or great guttes be hurt?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Of the place, for the ſmall guttes are ſet aboue the Nauill, and the greater guttes beneath.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  With what method then are the wounds of the guttes to be cured?
               
               
                  
                  Chirurgian
                  Let the Guttes firſt waſhed with wine of Mirrhe, bee brought into their vſuall place, and being firſt ſtitched with a thred, that ſtitch that Skinners vſe, let the portion of the Calle fallen out, on what part of the bellie it is, bee made equall in a ſound place: Let it be bound with ſome thred for that purpoſe, then let it be cut off half a fingers breadth from the knot, and being ſeared cloſe with a hot glowing iron, and ſo ſet in again, part of the thred left out: then let the Mirach and Peritonium be alſo bound together.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  How ought that to be done?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  In the firſt ſtitching let the Mirac with Peritonium be thruſt through with the needle: on the other part the Mirac alone. In the third ſtitch let the Mirac alſo be ſtitcht alone. In the fourth ſtitch the Mirac and Peritonium. In the ſixt the Mirac alone, and that by enterchangeable courſe ought to be done, ſomtimes by bath, and ſometimes by the one.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Is it ſo? what after that?
               
               
                  Chirurgian
                  The white of an Egge, without putting in of any Tent, is to be applyed, for the thred hanging out ſupplyeth the turn thereof.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  What muſt be done the day following?
               
               
                  Chirurgian
                  It is to be annointed with the Reſin of Firre, or Gum of Elenium, with the applying of Vnguentum Baſilicon Magiſtrale, and ſometimes a wound decoction is to be vſed.

                  Doctor.
                  
                     While we vſe theſe decoctions muſt nothing bee bound vpon the Wound?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Yes mary: the hearbs ſodden are ſtrayned, and with a little ſalt are applyed to the Wound.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Are there other potions otherwiſe compounded?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  There are many: for of theſe ſimples each man at his own diſcretion may deuiſe himſelf decoctions, which he may vſe with great ſucceſſe.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  You expreſſe all things ſo brieflie and plainlie, that nothing can be more. But there are others which in ſteed of theſe decoctions, do exſtract Oyles out of the ſayd Simples. Tell I pray you how that may be done.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Diuers men worke diuerſlie: but I will brieflie declare vnto you, that which herein is eaſie to done. They that extract Oyles out of flowers, doe firſt drie the Flowers in the winde, and after they are dryed: In each pound of Oyle of Oliues they put v. handfull of flowers therein mixed togither in a Stillitorie well ſtopt for two naturall dayes, are digeſted in Balneo Neptuni with a ſoft fire: namely, in the firſt degree. After theſe daies they take it out of the veſſell and ſtraine it, and if it cannot quite be ſtrained, they wring it out with a preſſe, as we were wont to doe while we preſſe Oyle out of Almonds.
               
               BALNEVM NEPTVNI.
               
                  Doctor.
                  At this firſt ſteiping of the Flowers in the Balneum, will the Oyle be perfect, or muſt this ſteiping be renewed?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  It muſt needs be renewed, but with other Flowers dried in the winde, for theſe muſt againe be ſteiped in the Oyle,

ſtrained and preſſed out, for two dayes ſpace, and beē put (as afore) in Balneum Neptuni, not aboue the firſt degree of heate, and then be preſt out and ſtrained.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  Doth this ſecond infuſion of flowers ſuffiſe then?
               
               
                  Chirurgian
                  It ſuffiſeth not: it muſt be repeated the lhird time in the ſame maner altogether as we haue ſpoken of. But after the ſecond day, the oyle that is preſt out muſt be ſet in a glaſſe Bodie well ſtopt, and in a Balneo Neptuni more hot, where it muſt remaine ſo long till the dregs be ſeperate from the Oyle, and the Oyle appeare cleare.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  So thy Neptune loue me, thou vttereſt all thoſe matters with an eaſie method, that if Peracelſus had performed the ſame, in good ſooth there would be manie, who leauing the groſſe bodies, would compoſe their medicinces of Oyles and Spirittes of the Bodies.
               
               
                  Chirurgion.
                  You ſay true: but the Oyle whereof we haue remembred is not perfect yet, vnles alſo another working be added
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Of what manner I pray you?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  This Oyle purged from his dregges, the Flegme: that is, the watery moiſture, which when it is ſeuered, it ought to be reſerued in a glaſſe, and in a cold place, that alſo muſt bee done with the help of Neptune.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  How ſay you? in a cold place: It ſhould be placed in the ſun rather, whoſe heat is ſaid to be vitall.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Away with that, that muſt be done in no wiſe, for ſo the oyle ſhould get a rank ſauour: contrariwiſe, if it be put in a colde place, it will be moſt fragrant, & wil breath forth the ſent of the flowers ſteipt therein.
               
               
                  
                  Doctor.
                  Are Oyles then in like ſort compoſed out of Herbs?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  I indeed: but that they muſt firſt of all be bruiſed together, and be chopt very ſmall, and therfore who ſo vnderſtandeth that hath gone before, ſhall eaſily extract Oyles out of Hearbes and Rootes.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Verie well: there reſteth nothing but that Chirurgians ſo do make their Oyles that they helpe the wounded, for ſo ſhall they purchaſe themſelues a name, and exerciſe this Arte with honour.

                  Doctor.
                  WHat thinke you of the ſpirite of Turpentine, is it not of greater power then the Oyles of the aforeſaid Hearbes?
               
               
                  Chirurgian
                  Yes ſurely, it is of miraculous facultie. So that if anie man had the true Spirite, it were no hard matter for him to cure all ſortes of Woundes in very ſhort time.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  Think you then the true Oyle thereof is ſeldom found?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Very many boſte that they haue it, but hetherto I haue found no man, whole Oile was not corrupt of Vulcan or the fyre.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  But Alchimiſts there are, that dream of nothing but Oyle.
               
               
                  
                  Chirurgian.
                  I feare me, they looſe their Oyle and their time and labour, for Vulcan vſeth their Furnace ouer hot, meet rather to mollifie yron, then to theſe kind of naturall workes.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  But tell me, I pray you, how you diſtil Oyle out of Turpentine, which is the moſt excellent medicin againſt wounds For I couet to heare, if you it remember thoſe things you haue learned.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  I will verilie ſhew you, and that moſt gladly; They that diſtill oyle out of Turpentine, doe firſt mingle vi. l. of Turpentine with iij. cuppes of water in a brazen veſſell, or a brazen Cucurbita with a crooked Limbeck. And before the Diſtillation they beſmeare the ioyntes with Lutum ſapientiae, to let expiration or breathing out: Which done, they diſtill with a ſlowe or ſoft fire: and immediately the Spirite with the water by drop-meale runneth out of the Limbecke into the Vial ſet vnderneath, and after that they ſee nothing more diſtilled by the help of Vulcan, they open the Cucurbita, and doe let the Turpentine coole.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  What then afterward?
               
               
                  Chirurgian
                  After that the Turpentine is cooled, they take it out of the Cucurbita, and they repeat the ſame afreſh with vi. l. of Turpentine, and iij. cups of water: And doe diſtil it as afore, and that ſo often, vntill they haue ſuch ſtore of Spirits as they wiſhed.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What auaileth it, or what vſe haue the Spirits mixt with the water?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  None, and therefore they ought to bee ſeperate from the water, that any may know their naturall force.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  
                     How great ſtore of Spirits doe come foorth in diſtillation of vj. l. of Tupentine and three cuppes of water.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  A pound with one third part of a pound, more or leſſe according as the Turpentine is pure or impure.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  You haue all at your fingers endes, and nothing is hid from you: proceed wee then to the compoſition of Oyle of Turpentine.

                  We take viij. l. or ix. l. of this Turpentine from whence the Spirits are ſeuered, and in the veſſel ſpoken of euen now, wee continually ſtirre it with a Splattor whiles it melteth through the heat of Vulcan, vntill all the water be vapoured out and doth no more aſcend.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Be there no ſignes whereby we know that the Turpentine hath boyled ynough before diſtillation?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  There are verily: while in boyling it is hard no more to knack, it is a moſt certaine ſigne that all the water is conſumed.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What is to be done after that?

                  Doctor
                  Whereof is this Lutum ſapient. compoſed?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  There are ſundry compoſitions for ſundry operations, but here it ſuffiſeth to take clay, with meale and whites of Egges.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  After that the ioyntes are luted with Lutum ſapient, as they tearme it, how muſt we proceed further?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Firſt, I reduce Vulcan to the firſt degree of heat, for being more vehement, it hindereth our operations.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  When Vulcan is ſo fitted to your intention, doe you goe on to diſtill without delay?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Yes mary: and within an houre and a halfe the diſtillation will be finiſhed. Howbeit, leaſt the time deceiue you, ſomtime you muſt let it worke ſo long, vntill that which diſtilleth ſhall appeare greene: for tha is the ſigne of perfect operation. and that no more Oyle remaines in the body of the Turpentine.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  All well done: Our Vulcan graunt that much profite to the commoditie of the Weale publike you may procure your ſelfe thereby, and that your Ople may be of ſo greate efficacie in healing woundes, that with it alone you may cure all whatſoeuer.
               
            
         
         
            
            
               ❧ The Practiſe of Cornelius Shilander touching Vlcers. THE SECOND PART.
            
               The firſt Lecture Concerning Humours and Qualities whereof Vlcers haue their originall.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  GOe to, tell what is an Vlcer.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  An Vlcer is a ſolution of the contiuitie, matterie and feſtering, but more properlie in Latin containing Pus & ſanies: For in an Vlcer is a thin matter, tearmed Sanies, and a thicke, which is called Sordis or Pus.
                  
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  And what is the beginning of this maladie?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  The Minerall of impurities, which by their ſaltiſhneſſe, ſharpneſſe, ſweetneſſe, ſowrneſſe, doeth corrode the ſkinne, through which, as an Emunctorie or cleanſing place it is expelled.
               
               
                  
                  Doctor.
                  Come they not then of Bloud, Choller, Melancholie, or Flegme.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Not ſo, for theſe parts of the bodie framed by Nature, that are authors of no euill, but only do couet what is good and perfect.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  You ſay well that they are partes: but the hot and colde qualities of theſe parts are the cauſes of Vlcers.Note.
                  
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Nay verily: theſe qualities are only the effects of impurities: for Choller, doth not becauſe it is hot, erode or fret the members, otherwiſe it ſhould ſo do alwayes, ſith it is at no time not hot, but becauſe the impuritie of Choller preuaileth in ſharpneſſe, which imprinteth in the members an heat vnnaturall.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  What is it then that doth worke?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Euen that which is ſaltiſh, bitter, tart and ſweet: theſe are ſuch as haue ſome force, as ſaith Hippocrates, which while they exceed in a man, they bring foorth effects beſides Nature, the hotneſſes, coldneſſes, drineſſes, and moyſtneſſes are of no effecacie.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What here I hetherto, it hath bene beleeued that Vlcers proceeded from the diſtemper of humors or elements.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  I confeſſe indeed that it is commonly ſaide, but this diſtemper hath wrought great miſchiefe to Philoſophie, and bewitched the eyes of manie, who ſuppoſing to haue caught the Kernell, got the rindes and ſhales.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Are there not then foure humours in man?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  
                     Yes in ſooth, there are, yea, and many more.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  How many therefore?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  So many as be ſortes of cullours: there is an humour white, dunne, yellowe, blacke, redde, greene, blew, purple, &c.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Then you ſeeme to deride the fourefolde differences of humours?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Why not deride it?
               
               
                  Doctor
                  Why not deride it? Ti's a point of raſhneſſe to hold opinion one iote againſt the Philoſophers decrees.
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Not at all: Plato is my friend, ſo is Ariſtotle: but the trueth is more my friend.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Did the Philoſophers erre then in the quaternitie of Elements, and their mixture?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  I, indeed.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  How ſo?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  It is repugnant to holie Scriptures, which is the true Philoſophie: God (ſaith Moſes) ſhope man of the mold of the earth: that is, of water and earth mixt together.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Doeth that then come to paſſe without the admixtion of aire and fire.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Who doubts it? Ariſtotles aire is found no where, and Fire is an accident, and not a ſubſtance.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Tuſh man, whats that you ſay?
               
               
                  
                  Chirurgian.
                  It's eaſie to be conceiued, if one knoweth that a fire-cole which we cal Fire, differeth from a dead cole, as they terme it, not on fire only accidētally, like as yron glowing hot, from that which is colde and glowes not. Bodies alſo are reſolued into water and earth alone, For the vapor and exhallation aſcend, and the groſſe earth, abides in the botome of the Cucurbita.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Trulie ſpoken indeed: but it is the part of Philoſophers to conſider thoſe things: For a Chirurgian it is ynough to know Choller, Flegme, Bloud, and Melancholie, with their heating and cooling qualities,
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  It is not to the end a man may haue the nature of an Vlcer throughlie knowne, becauſe a man is compounded only of water and earth, and with them alone is nouriſhed, it is behoofull to know the differences of earths and waters, for according to the diuerſities of theſe, diuers Vlcers ſpring in man.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Vnfold to vs the originall beginnings of Vlcers, for I vnderſtand not how that commeth.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  We feed on bread, hearbes and fleſh, we drinke water, Ale, or Beere, and wine. It is certaine that in theſe watery or earthy, impurities, lurke that which for their vnlikenes of Nature cannot be altered into our bodies: Whiles therfore the pure cannot by the benefite of Nature bee ſeuered from the impure,Note. there is made an interchangeable commixture of both. Mallowes with Nettles, and Arſnick with Violettes is mingled, which tempered of mutuall mixture ſo long, doe remit or ſlake their egreneſſe, till they ſhall be ſeuered.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What?
               
               
                  
                  Chirurgian
                  This earthie or watery impuritie, free from the mixture of purity is exalted by reaſon of its ſaltiſhnes, ſharpnes ſweetneſſe, or ſowrneſſe corrodeth the fleſh and ſkin, and breedeth calidities, humidities, and other accidents.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Very well: but if Vlcers bee ingendred of water and earth, how becomes their difference ſo manifold?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Becauſe the difference of earthes and waters is manifold: for the water and earth of the Nettle is one, of Arſnicke another, of Pepper another, and ſo of the reſt: of which ſome are ſaltiſh corraſiue, other ſome are ſharp pricking. &c.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Is water with earth then the Genus or generall thing from which Vlcers are deriued, and in which they are contayned?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Aſſuredly, and nothing more rrue, though it be againſt the common opinion of Philoſophers.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  You vtter Paradoxes, written of none, ſo farre as I know.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  I acknowledge thē to be Paradoxes, but ſuch as ought of none not be allowed, euen as Tartar lies in ſweet wine in forme reſolued, which in proceſſe of time is congealed, or as it were,Note. curded, and cleaues to the veſſels ſides. So in man are found impurities, which in digeſted times being congealed or feſtered, do breed in the fleſh Vlcers agreable to their Nature.

                  Doctor
                  PRoceed we now to the methode to be kept in Vlcers?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Heer like as in wounds we proceed with diſgeſtiues and Mundificatiues.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What kind of methode is this then?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  The purging and due maner of diet being let paſſe, which muſt be ſought of the curatine and dietarie parte: Firſt, we ſhall digeſt the matter, till Pus appears equally white: then we ſhall mundifie the matter ſufficiently concocted, Exſiccatiues that may drie vp the humiditie in the Vlcer not neglected. Theſe doings finiſhed, Nature her ſelfe will procreate fleſh, and bring Vlcers to conſolidation, ſo that by the Chirurgian ſhe be rightly kept from the iniury of the ayre: that is, be bound with Emplaſters that may preſerue her.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  You ſay well: for the Chirurgian is Natures Gardien or keeper, but when any Vlcer is offered to cure, ſhall wee forthwith digeſt the matter?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Yes: ſo it be ſimple: that is, ſo as no Paine, or Flegmon, or Tuwer, or Apoſtume, or Calloſitie, or Fluxe of bloud or corruption of the bone be ioyned withal: otherwiſe while it is compoundes, the ſaid accidents are firſt away to bee taken, then after, a man may proceed further by the methode wee haue declared.
               
               
                  
                  Doctor
                  By what meanes may theſe be remooued quite?
               
               
                  Chirurgian
                  Dolour or paine by medicines, Anodinae aſſwaging it, Flegmon by the vnguent of Roſh, Callouſnes and corruption of the bone by Cantiers, after Vigo: Flure of bloud by Croco Martis, Tumor, or ſwelling by Vnguentum Agrippinum, with Oyle of Tartor: of Apoſtume we ſhall ſpeake hereafter.

                  In how manie differences are Vlces found?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  In manifold: for ſo many Vlcers there be, as be diuerſities of impurities: and impurities either haue the action and propertie of Arſnick, and become peſtilent Vlcers, with mightie inflamation, or haue the propertie of Alom, and become corroſiue, or haue the Nettles propertie, and become ſharp & biting: or haue the property of Popie and Mandrag or of other vegitables and Mineralles, and become Vlcers: which for the diuerſitie of impurities, do alot to themſelues diuers names.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Aſſuredly your ſpeeches are far more probable then theirs that aſcribe all theſe matters to Choller, melancholie or Flegme, and that wil raeher borrow theſe names from the vtter tokens, that is, from the cullors, then from the inward properties.

                  Chirurgian.
                  It is ſo: know therefore that the Fiſtula is a deepe and hollow Vlcer, indurated with a ſtrict and narrow Orific,Methodes ad Fiſtulas curandas. which requireth exerciſe or handy operation, and not the Phyſitions help.

                  Decoctions and reaſonable diet, which take away the cauſe, whereof Fiſtulaes doe proceed, for I haue ſeene many well cured by theſe means only.

                  It is not heer to be ſpoken of, for theſe and ſuch like are to be ſought for in the other part of medicine, namely to ſuch as belong to Phiſicke and diet.

                  Yes trulie they are: vnleſſe they proceed of the French Poxe, for thoſe ſcabbes will not giue place to ſo light medicines.

               The ſeuenth Lecture. Of the preparation of the Oyle of Guiacum that is, of the holie wood.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  LEt vs come I pray you to the Oyle of holy wood, which as it is ſaid, hath a maruellous facultie in Vlcers.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  I am content, for that cannot be omitted without great offence, which wee knowe to doe much good in a common weale.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Doe you ſuppoſe that this Oyle is the beſt Antidote to heale Vlcers?
               
               
                  Chirurgian,
                  This ought not to be doubted of any man, and chiefly to thoſe Vlcers which haue their originall of the Spaniſh, or if you had rather, of the French Poxe.
               
               
                  
                  Doctor.
                  Hitherto I had thought that that diſeaſe could not bee cured without Quickſiluer, which being by a certaine propertie begotten to himſelf, all men ſay it is a remedy in ſuch a ſickneſſe.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  That is leaſt of all true: For the Oyle of holy wood is more effectuous, and hee is holpen more eaſily, ſo that it be well prepared of the Chimiſts, and the naturall collour not eqanged into a fierie, by reaſon of an immoderate heat.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  And are there certain degrees of fire to be kept in diſtillation becauſe we muſt not run hither and thither.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  There are truly: for otherwiſe his nature that is diſtilled ſhould be corrupted: for as all things are not hot in the ſame degrees, but either drie, cold, or moiſt, ſo likewiſe diuers degrees of fire are to be obſerued in diſtillations, for that both the nature of the hearb, and the diuerſities of the operation requireth it.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Trulie I would heare of you the whole matter, for it ſeemeth to me that no man ought to be ignorant of the work
               
               
                  Chirugian
                  You ſay true: but the handling hereof would require a great volume, if we ſhould ſet it down according to the worthineſſe thereof: heer it ſuffiſeth vs to ſhewe in what degree the fire ought to be kept, whiles we draw the oyle out of the wood Guiacum, or holie wood.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  Well ſayd: For he which doth declare any thing particularlie, it is more eaſily vnderſtood of the Reader, then he which doeth it generallie, eſpeciallie in ſuch varietie of diſtillations, and degrees thereof: Goe to therefore, tell mee how the Oyle of this wood is called holie, is it becauſe of his efficacie.
               
               
                  
                  Chirurgian.
                  Trulie it is: But the better to get this oyle it is needful to haue a large great retorte well luted with clay, called the Lute of wiſdome, the Guiacum ought to be turned ſmall, and in light peeces, and alſo a veſſell of cold water muſt bee prouided, through which a braſen and hollow pipe muſt paſſe.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Theſe things are eaſie to be done, but how muſt the reſt of the worke be accompliſhed.
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Then the retort muſt be filled with Guiacum, being ſmal cut almoſt to the necke.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  And this is eaſie?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Being fild and luted (as we haue ſaid) we ſet it in the furnace following. So that the necke of the Retort bee left out three handfulles emptie, and ſo to bee let into the pipe that paſſeth through the water.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  I wold to God Paracelſus himſelf had declared his works with ſo eaſie a method: there would be found more Paracelſians than Galeniſts: but what followeth?
               
               
                  Chirurgian.
                  Both the Orifiſts and the neck of the retort with the pipe are to be luted with clay on both ſides, the bredth of an inch, leaſt the ſpirites breath out whiles it is diſtilling: For the Spirits, becauſe they are deliuered from their bodies, doe eaſilie flie, therefore the veſſels and all the chinkes ought to be well fenced with the Lute of wiſedome.
               
               
                  Doctor
                  Theſe things haue no difficultie at all as I think.
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Well ſaid: it hath no difficultie, but the operation is ſomewhat harde, but if thou art deſirous to practiſe, firſt make a furnace with a veſſell full of cold water.
               
               
                  
                  Doct.
                  Verie well: but muſt it not haue in the top of the Furnace the forme of a Teſticle?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  It is true: Therfore after all things be finiſhed acording to that order which we haue ſpoken of principally, it is to be wrought with a gentle fire, leaſt that veſſel hauing the forme of a teſticle breake.
               
               
                  Do.
                  Muſt we then diſpatch the buſineſſe with a gentle fire?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  No trulie: but you muſt increaſe the fire with degrees, that is to ſay, by litle and litle, vntil ye ſee the oyle and the water to diſtill into the receiuer.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  How long ſhall the Oyle diſtill?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  I know not that! but know this, when it can diſtill no more then leaue off working, for it is a token of no more moiſture and ſpirits in the bodie of the Guyacum.
                  
               
               
                  Doct.
                  Is the Oyle of the Guyacum therefore diſtilled then?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  It is truly: but yet doth it want other preparations.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What are they, I pray you?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Firſt of all, that which is found in the Receyuer, both water and oyle, they muſt be afterwards ſeperated
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  How muſt they be ſeperated?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Becauſe the Oyle doth pierce to the bottome, and is blacke like Pitch, the water muſt bee poured foorth by little and litle.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Doth this water containe in it any faculty?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Yea trulie: but we will omit it here, and wee will haue nothing but the Oyle it ſelfe.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  But tell me, what muſt we doe with the Oyle ſeperated from the water?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  The Oyle is to be put into another Cucurbita and a little water is to be poured vnto it:
               
               
                  Do.
                  What kind of head or receiuer muſt be put vnto it? one with a ſnowt or beake, as we haue ſpoken of, or any other
               
               
                  Chirur.
                  Euery kind of Limbecke is not conuenient for this work, therfore that is the moſt apteſt, that which is called

a Vapour, becauſe it containeth in his vpper part colde water.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  Wherefore is it ſo?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Becauſe with the cooling of the head & ſnowt, the Oyle is kept downe, and ſo falleth into the bottom of the Cucurbita, from whence it aſcendeth not:
               
               
                  Do.
                  How long ſhall we diſtill?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  So long as you ſee any thing diſtill into the Receiuer.
               
               
                  Do,
                  What muſt we doe afterwards?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  That which is in the receiuer you may reſerue to your ſelfe if you wil, for the oyle lieth in the bottom of the Cucurbita:
               
               
                  Do.
                  How is the oyle taken out of the Cucurbita?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  After the veſſell is cooled, it muſt be opened, and the water which you find in the veſſell muſt bee ſeperated from the oyle by a leaſurely pouring out, leaſt any of the Oyle paſſe therewith:
               
               
                  Do.
                  Is the oyle then perfect, being ſeperated from the water, doth it need no other preparation?
               
               
                  Chirur.
                  As yet it hath not his perfection: Moreouer, we haue need of another metamorphoſis that we be not fruſtrat of hope:
               
               
                  Do.
                  I pray you what metamorphoſis is this?
               
               
                  Chir.
                  This Oyle which is ſeperated from the water, is to be put into a Cucurbita of glaſſe.
               
               
                  Do.
                  Muſt we then diſtill it a third time, I feare me leaſt the diſtillation ſo many times repeated, will marre the nature of the Oyle:
               
               
                  Chirurg,
                  Why ſhould it marre it: Nay rather, feare leaſt the Doues flie out from their open neſts.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Muſt we then diſtill it in a braſen Inſtrument, on the which the Vapor is ouerluted?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  We muſt haue another inſtrument, as I haue ſaid, for the Oyle muſt runne into a glaſſe Cucurbita, or rather a Receiuer.
               
               
                  
                  Do.
                  What afttrwards?
               
               
                  Chirurg,
                  There muſt be alſo a glaſſen Limbecke luted ouer.
               
               
                  Do.
                  Well, one glaſſe in another aptly agreeing.
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  And this Cucurbita muſt bee ſet in a veſſel of Sand, fit for the Lembick, in the firſt degree of heat.
               
               
                  Do.
                  Will it then diſtill?
               
               
                  Chir.
                  Doe you aſke whether it will diſtill: Yes truly, you ſhall ſee Oyle as red as bloud in the Receiuer, which is of ſuch facultie that nothing can goe beyond it.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  How long muſt we diſtil?
               
               
                  Chir.
                  So long vntill no more wil come foorth.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  Are the Fecis that are left in the bottome after diſtillation profitable?
               
               
                  Chiru.
                  They are truly: but they require to be mingled, and before mingling to be rectified in Horſe-dung: of which matter, ſeeing the operation is ſomewhat difficult, I purpoſe not here to ſpeake of it, let our Oyle ſuffiſe you, whoſe facultie, how great it is, experience ſhall tell you, for good marchandize needeth no praiſe.
               
            
            
               The eighth Lecture. Of the maner to prepare Waxe before Diſtillation.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  VVHat think you of the Oyle of Waxe, is there great difficultie in the preparing of it?
               
               
                  Chi.
                  Do you not perceiue ſuch difficulty as ſome ſuppoſe?
               
               
                  Do.
                  I pray you teach me how it is made of the chirurgiā.
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Before all things the Waxe muſt be prepared, for this part being omitted as the chiefeſt, no oyle is drawn from the Waxe.
               
               
                  
                  Doctor.
                  Therfore how muſt it be prepared?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Amongſt all other preparations, this is one of the beſt: Four or fiue pounds of Virgin wax broken into ſixe or ſeuen peces, muſt be put into the Cucurbita, to the which muſt be poured three pettes of Malmſey wine.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What afterwards?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  The Vapor being ouerluted, and the fire ſo to be tempered leaſt the waxe flow ouer, as it is a boyling.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  In what degree of heat muſt it be then.
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  In the ſecond: neuertheleſſe, if you ſee a little of the Waxe togither with the wine in like maner to diſtill euer, you may not thinke therfore that you haue erred, for this Waxe after the Cucurbita it luted, may bee mingled againe.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  The veſſell being well fitted, how is the operation to be expected?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  That muſt be done by the help of Vulcan, that the waxe with the wine may boyle in the Cucurbita.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What doth this Ebrilution profit: or whereunto ſerueth it?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  It ſerueth that in the boyling, the ſpirit of the Wine with the waxe by little and little doth diſtill.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  Ought this diſtillation to be often repeated?
               
               
                  Chir.
                  Yea, often therfore, that the waxe may be wel prepared, after that we haue of this diſtilled wine one pynt, then we poure it againe vpon the waxe through a pipe from the one ſide: and leaſt any ſhould euaporate, we ſtop it cloſe.
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  What if the Waxe ſticke vnto th pipe of the Limbecke?
               
               
                  Chirur.
                  It muſt be drawne forth by litle and litle otherwiſe the beak would be ſtopped vp.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  What afterwards?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Secondarily, the diſtillation hereof ought to be renued, and eye pinte of the diſtilled wine (as before) muſt be poured in againe through a wide pipe, and worke it together twelue howres that there may be a certaine recipricall

Diſtillation and powring foorth.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  And what muſt we doe after twelue howers?
               
               
                  Chirur,
                  The diſtillation being repeated, you ſhal gather the ſpirit of the wine and waxe: this ſpirit you muſt reſerue, for it muſt be mingled with the Oyle of Waxe, as afterward ſhall be taught.
               
               
                  Doc.
                  Is the waxe then ſufficiently prepated with theſe abſolute things?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Not ſo: but after many diſtillations, the Cucurbita is to bee opened, and the Waxe muſt bee ſepeeated from the Flegme to which it is mingled.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  How muſt that be done I pray you?
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Only preſſing it downe with your handes.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  You ſay well: for with preſſing downe the waxe, the moyſture is taken away.
               
               
                  Chirurg.
                  Then this Waxe being ſeperated from his Flegme, muſt be put into the Cucurbita, from whence it was taken, and afterwards is to be molten at a gentle fire, and wrought with a Spatula ſo long till it aſcende no more, and that there come no ſmoke from it, or hath no more froth vpon it.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  Are theſe ſure tokens wherby we may know that the waxe is ſufficiently prepared.
               
               
                  Chirur.
                  Yea doubtleſſe, and all theſe things are wel to be bept in memorie, the diſtillations & pouring foorth by courſe the preſſing out of the Flegmes, the boyling and working of the Waxe, vntill we ſee theſe tokens now ſpoken of, but if all things be done as it ought to bee, we ſhall eaſily drawe out the Oile of Waxe.
               
            
            
               The ninth Lecture. Of the maner of drawing oyle out of Wax being prepared▪
               
               
                  Doctor.
                  THe Waxe being ſufficiently prepared, how afterwardes ſhall we diſtill the Oyle?
               
               
                  
                  Chirurgi.
                  The Ware is to be made hot, and to be put into a large Retorte of Glaſſe well luted with tbat lute which is called Lutum Sapientiae, vnto whoſe necke a pype ſhal be aglutinated and ſo made to paſſe through a veſſell of cold water.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  How is that Lute made?
               
               
                  Chirur.
                  With clay, with Fullers hayre, with whites of Egges and ſand.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  After the Retort is luted, with his necke and pipe, what muſt we doe?
               
               
                  Chir.
                  It muſt be placed in the furnace, begin your work firſt with a gentle fire, by the ſpace of one whole houre.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  And how muſt we proceed afterwards?
               
               
                  Chirur.
                  The fire muſt be encreaſed by degrees, vntill ſuch time that all the ſubſtance be come foorth into the receiuer, which will be ſomewhat groſſe, but neuertheleſſe of moſt excellent efficacie.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  Will not the oyle then be cleare after the order of Turpentine?
               
               
                  Chirur.
                  No, it will not: but it will be congealed: for to haue it cleare would require an often diſtillation, and cauſe the oyle to be of a more hotter operation and ſharper.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  Tell me the vertue of this oyle, and how it ought to be applyed?
               
               
                  Chiru.
                  It is moſt excellent in al wounds & Vlcers whatſoeuer, if it be rightly applyed, beſides it may be miniſtred inwardly for diuers deſeaſes, as occaſion ſhal be offered.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  Haue we now finiſhed our diſcourſe in euerie reſpect, as may be neceſſarie for a Chirurgian.
               
               
                  Chirur.
                  We haue for this time, vntil it pleaſe God to cauſe vs to meet againe.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  I pray you then make a briefe repetition of ſuch conferences as hath paſt between vs ſince our firſt meeting.
               
               
                  Chi.
                  Moſt willingly: for it ſhal be moſt neceſſary for the refreſhing of both our memories.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  I thank you: I ſhal be a debtor vnto you for your courteſie.
               
               
                  
                  Chir.
                  In our firſt conference I defined vnto you what Chirurgery was, what was the operatiō of a chirurgian: The 2. of the differēce of wounds & thir curing: Thirdly, of the ſtitching of wounds Fourthly, of contuſed wounds: Of deep wounds: Of wounds of the ſinewes: Of wounds of the head: Of wounds piercing the breaſt: Of wounds of the inteſtines and bellie: Of the drawing oyle out of hearbes: Of compounding the ſpirit of Turpentine: Of drawing the oyle out of Turpentine. Of Vlcers, Fiſtulaes and Scabs: Of the drawing Oyle out of Lignum fanctum, and of Waxe: Of all which, I haue briefly and ſimply diſcourſed of, according to that knowledge which God hath giuen me.
               
               
                  Doct.
                  You haue ſatiſfied me of al things that I can bethinke me worthy the aſking, only I am to requeſt you to ſet me downe ſome receipts, wherof you make good accompt, which may be as a ſupply for the breuitie we haue vſed in our conferences,
               
               
                  Chi.
                  Indeed, in many places of our talk I omitted the rehearſal of diuers medicines, which of purpoſe I did to bring them in together at the end: which ſhal ſerue as an Antydotarie for you to reſort vnto, when as occaſion ſhal require.
