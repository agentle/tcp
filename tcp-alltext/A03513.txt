SHIELD. Tranſlated as the other ſeuen Bookes

            To the moſt honored Earle,
Earle Marſhall.
            
               
                  SPondanus, one of the moſt deſertfull Commentars
of Homer, cals all ſorts of all men
learned to be iudicial beholders of this more
then Artificiall and no leſſe then Diuine
Rapture; then which nothing can be imagined
more full of ſoule and humaine extraction:
for what is here prefigurde by our miraculous
Artiſt, but the vniuerſall world, which being ſo ſpatious
and almoſt vnmeaſurable, one circlet of a Shield repreſentes
and imbraceth? In it heauen turnes, the ſtarres ſhine, the earth
is enflowred, the ſea ſwelles and rageth, Citties are built: one in
the happineſſe and ſweetneſſe of peace, the other in open warre &
the terrors of ambuſh &c. And all theſe ſo liuely propoſde, as not
without reaſon many in times paſt haue belieued, that all theſe
thinges haue in them a kind of voluntarie motion: euen as thoſe
Tripods of Vulcan, and that Dedalian Venus 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ;
nor can I be reſolu'd that their opinions be ſufficiently refuted by
Ariſtonicus, for ſo are all things here deſcribed, by our diuineſt
Poet, as if they conſiſted not of hard and ſolid mettals, but of a
truely, liuing, and mouing ſoule: The ground of his inuention
he ſhews out of Euſtathius: intending by the Orbiguitie of the
Shield, the roundneſſe of the world: by the foure mettalles, the
foure elementes: viz. by gold fire: by braſſe earth for the hardnes:
by Tinne water, for the ſoftnes, and inclination to fluxure:

by ſiluer, Aire, for the groſnes & obſcuritie of the mettal before it
be refind. That which he cals 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , he vnderſtands
the Zodiack, which is ſaid to be triple for the latitude it cō
               tains,
& ſhining by reaſon of the perpetual courſe of the Sun made
in that circle, by 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                the Axletree, about which
heauē hath his motion &c. Nor do I deny (ſaith Spondanus) Eneas
arms to be forged, with an exceeding height of wit by Virgil,
but comparde with theſe of Homer, they are nothing. And this
is it (moſt honorde) that maketh me thus ſodainely tranſlate this
Shield of Achilles, for ſince my publication of the other ſeuen
bookes, compariſon hath beene made betweene Virgill and Homer:
who can be comparde in nothing with more decyſall & cutting
of all argument, then in theſe two Shieldes; and whoſoeuer
ſhall reade Homer throughly and worthily, will know the queſtion
comes from a ſuperficiall and too vnripe a reader: for Homers
Poems were writ from a free furie, an abſolute & full ſoule:
Virgils out of a courtly, laborious, and altogether imitatorie ſpirit:
not a Simile hee hath but is Homers: not an inuention,
perſon, or diſpoſition, but is wholly or originally built vpon Homericall
foundations, and in many places hath the verie wordes
Homer vſeth: beſides, where Virgill hath had no more plentifull
and liberall a wit, then to frame twelue imperfect bookes of
the troubles and trauailes of Aeneas: Homer hath of as little
ſubiect finiſht eight & fortie perfect: and that the triuiall obiection
may be anſwerd, that not the number of bookes, but the nature
and excellence of the worke commends it: All Homers bookes
are ſuch as haue beene preſidents euer ſince of all ſortes of Poems:
imitating none, nor euer worthily imitated of any: yet would I
not be thought ſo ill created as to bee a malicious detracter of ſo
admired a Poet as Virgill, but a true iuſtifier of Homer, who
muſt not bee read for a few lynes with leaues turned ouer caprichiouſly
in diſmembred fractions, but throughout; the whole

drift, weight & height of his workes ſet before the apprehſiue eyes
of his iudge. The maieſtie he enthrones and the ſpirit he infuſeth
into the ſcope of his worke ſo farre outſhining Virgill, that his
skirmiſhes are but meere ſcramblings of boyes to Homers; the
ſilken body of Virgils muſe curiouſly areſt in guilt and embrodered
ſiluer, but Homers in plaine maſsie and vnualued gold: not
onely all learning, gouernment, and wiſedome being deduc't as
from a bottomleſſe fountaine from him; but all wit, elegancie, diſpoſition
and iudgement. 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                &c.
Homer (ſaith Plato) was the Prince and maiſter of all prayſes
and vertues: the Emperour of wiſe men: an hoſt of men againſt
any deprauer in any principle he held. All the ancient and
lately learned haue had him in equall eſtimation. And for anie
to be now contrarilie affected, it muſt needes proceed from a meere
want onneſſe of witte: an Idle vnthriftie ſpirit: wilfull becauſe
they may chooſe whether they will think otherwiſe or not, & haue
power and fortune enough to liue like true men without truth, or
els they muſt preſume of puritanicall inſpiration, to haue that
with delicacie & ſquemiſhnes, which others with as good means,
ten times more time, and ten thouſand times more labour could
neuer conceiue. But ſome will conuey their imperfections vnder
his Greeke Shield, and from thence beſtowe bitter arrowes againſt
the traduction, affirming their want of admiration grows
from defect of our language, not able to expreſſe the coppie and
elegancie of the originall: but this eaſie and traditionall pretext
hides them not enough: for how full of height and roundneſſe
ſoeuer Greeke be aboue Engliſh, yet is there no depth of conconceipt
triumphing in it, but as in a meere admirer it may bee
imagined; ſo in a ſufficient tranſlator it may be expreſt. And Homer
that hath his chiefe holineſſe of eſtimation, for matter and
inſtruction, would ſcorne to haue his ſupreame worthineſſe gloſing
in his courtſhippe and priuiledge of tongue. And if Italian,

French & Spaniſh, haue not made it daintie, nor thought it any
preſumption to turne him into their languages, but a fit and honorable
labour and (in reſpect of their countries profit and their
poeſies credit) 
                  •••
               oſt neceſſarie, what curious, proud, and poore
ſhamefaſtneſſe ſhould let an Engliſh muſe to traduce him, when
the language ſhe workes withall is more conformable, fluent, and
expreſsiue; which I would your Lordſhip would commaunde mee
to proue againſt all our whippers of their owne complement in
their countries dialect.
            O what peeuiſh ingratitude and moſt vnreaſonable ſcorne of
our ſelues we commit, to bee ſo extrauagant and forreignely witted,
to honour and imitate that in a ſtrange tongue, which wee
condemne and contemne in our natiue? for if the ſubſtance of
the Poets will be expreſt and his ſentence and ſence rendred with
truth and elocution, hee that takes iudiciall pleaſure in him in
Greeke, cannot beare ſo rough a browe to him in Engliſh, to entombe
his acceptance in auſteritie.
            But thou ſoule-blind Scalliger, that neuer hadſt any thing but
place, time and termes, to paint thy proficiencie in learning, nor
euer writeſt any thing of thine owne impotent braine, but thy
onely impalſied diminution of Homer (which I may ſweare was
the abſolute inſpiration of thine owne ridiculous Genius) neuer
didſt thou more palpably damn thy droſsy ſpirit in al thy all countries-exploded
filcheries, which are ſo groſſely illiterate, that no
man will vouchſafe their refutation, then in thy ſenceleſſe reprehenſions
of Homer; whoſe ſpirit flew aſmuch aboue thy groueling
capacitie, as heauen moues aboue Barathrum: but as none
will vouchſafe repetition nor anſwere of thy other vnmanly fooleries:
no more will I of theſe, my Epiſtle being too tedious to your
Lo: beſides, and no mans iudgement ſeruing better, (if your
high affaires could admit their diligent peruſall) then your Lo:
to refute and reiect him. But alas Homer is not now to bee lift

vp by my weake arme, more then he is now depreſt by more feeble
oppoſitions, if any feele not their conceiptes ſo rauiſht with the
eminent beauties of his aſcentiall muſe, as the greateſt men of all
ſorts and of all ages haue beene. Their moſt modeſt courſe is, (vnleſſe
they will be powerfully inſolent) to aſcribe the defect to their
apprehenſion, becauſe they read him but ſleightly, not in his ſurmiſed
frugalitie of obiect, that really and moſt feaſtfully powres
out himſelfe in right diuine occaſion. But the chiefe and vnanſwerable
meane to his generall and iuſt acceptance, muſt be your
Lo. high and of all men expected preſident, without which hee
muſt like a poore ſnayle, pull in his Engliſh hornes, that out of all
other languages (in regard of the countries affection, and royaltie
of his Patrones) hath appeard like an Angell from a clowde,
or the world out of Chaos. When no language can make compariſon
of him with ours if he be worthily conuerted; wherein before
he ſhould haue beene borne ſo lame and defectiue, as the French
midwife hath brought him forth, he had neuer made queſtiō how
your Lo. would accept him: and yet haue two of their Kings, embraced
him, as a wealthy ornament to their ſtudies, and the main
battayle of their armies.
            If then your bountie would do me but the grace to conferre my
vnhappie labours with theirs ſo ſucceſſefull & commended (your
iudgement ſeruing you much better then your leyſure & yet your
leiſure in thinges honourable being to bee inforced by your iudgement)
no malitious & diſhonorable whiſperer, that comes armed
with an army of authority and ſtate againſt harmeles & armeles
vertue, could wreſt your wonted impreſsion ſo much from it ſelf, to
reiect (with imitation of tiranous contempt any affection ſo zealous
& able in this kind to honor your eſtate as mine. Onely kings
& princes haue been Homers Patrones, amongſt whom Ptolomie
wold ſay, he that had ſleight handes to entertayne Homer,
had as ſleight braines to rule his common wealth. And an vſuall

ſeueritie he vſed, but a moſt rationall (how preciſe and ridiculous
ſoeuer it may ſeeme to men made of ridiculous matter) that in
reuerence of the pietie and perfect humanitie he taught; whoſoeuer
writ or committed any proud detraction againſt Homer (as
euen ſo much a man wanted not his malitious deprauers) hee put
him with torments to extreameſt death. O high and magically
rayſed proſpect, from whence a true eye may ſee meanes to the abſolute
redreſſe, or much to be wiſhed extenuation, of all the vnmanly
degeneracies now tyranyſing amongſt vs: for if that which
teacheth happineſſe and hath vnpainefull coroſiues in it, (being
entertayned and obſerued) to eate out the hart of that raging vlcer,
which like a Lernean Fen of corruption furnaceth the vniuerſall
ſighes and complaintes, of this tranſpoſed world; were
ſeriouſly, and as with armed garriſons defended and hartned; that
which engenders & diſperſeth, that wilfull peſtilence, would bee
purged and extirpate: but that which teacheth, being ouerturned,
that which is taught is conſequently ſubiect to euerſion: and if the
honour, happineſſe and preſeruation of true humanitie conſiſt in
obſeruing the lawes fit for mans dignitie; and that the elaborate
preſcription of thoſe lawes muſt of neceſſitie be authoriſed, fauoured
and defended before any obſeruation can ſucceed: is it vnreaſonable,
to puniſh the contempt of that mouing preſcription with
one mans death, when at the heeles of it followes common neglect
of obſeruation, and in the necke of it, an vniuerſall ruine? This
my Lord I enforce only to interrupt in others that may reade this
vnſauorie ſtuffe, the too open mouthd damnation of royall & vertuous
Ptolomies ſeueritie. For to digeſt, tranſforme and ſweat
a mans ſoule into rules and attractions to ſocietie; ſuch as are faſhiond
and temperd with her exact and long laborde contention
of ſtudie; in which ſhe toſſeth with her impertiall diſcourſe before
her, all cauſe of fantaſticall obiections and reproofes; and without
which ſhe were as wiſe as the greateſt number of detractors that

ſhall preſume to cenſure her; and yet by their flaſh and inſolent caſtigations
to bee ſleighted and turnde ouer their miſerably vaine
tongues in an inſtant; is an iniurie worthy no leſſe penaltie then
Ptolomie inflicted. To take away the heeles of which running
prophanation. I hope your Lo. honourable countenance will be as
the Vnicorns horne, to leade the way to Engliſh Homers yet poyſoned
fountaine: for till that fauour be vouchſafed, the herde will
neuer drinke, ſince the venemous galles of ſome of their fellowes
haue infected it, whom alas I pittie. Thus confidently affirming
your name and dignities ſhall neuer bee more honored in a poore
booke then in Engliſh Homer, I ceaſe to afflict your Lordſhippe
with my tedious dedicatories, and to ſtill ſacred Homers ſpirit
through a language ſo fitte and ſo fauourles; humbly preſenting
your Achilleian vertues with Achilles Shield; wiſhing
as it is much more admirable and diuine, ſo it
were as many times more rich, then the
Shield the Cardinall pawnd
at Anwerp.
            
            
               By him that wiſheth all the degrees of
iudgement, and honour, to attend
your deſerts to the higheſt, George Chapman.
            
         
         
            
            To the vnderſtander.
            
               YOu are not euery bodie, to you (as
to one of my very few friends) I may
be bold to vtter my minde, nor is it
more empaire to an honeſt and abſolute
mans ſufficiencie to haue few
friendes, then to an Homericall Poeme
to haue few commenders; for
neyther doe common diſpoſitions
keepe fitte or plauſible conſort with iudiciall and ſimple
honeſtie, nor are idle capacities comprehenſible of an elaborate
Poeme. My Epiſtle dedicatorie before my ſeuen
bookes, is accounted darke and too much laboured: for
the darkenes there is nothing good or bad, hard or ſofte,
darke or perſpicuous but in reſpect, & in reſpect of mens
light, ſleight, or enuious peruſalles (to whoſe looſe capacities
any worke worthily compoſde is knit with a riddle)
& that the ſtile is materiall flowing, & not ranke, it may
perhaps ſeeme darke, to ranke riders or readers, that haue
no more ſoules then burbolts: but to your comprehenſion
& in it ſelfe, I know it is not. For the affected labour beſtowed
in it, I proteſt two morninges both ended it and
the Readers Epiſtle: but the truth is, my deſire & ſtrange
diſpoſition in all thinges I write, is to ſet downe vncommon,
and moſt profitable coherents for the time: yet further
remoued from abhorde affectation, then from the
moſt popular and cold diſgeſtion. And I euer imagine

that as Italian & French Poems to our ſtudious linguiſtes,
win much of their diſcountryed affection, as well becauſe
the vnderſtanding of forreigne tongues is ſweete to their
apprehenſion, as that the matter & inuention is pleaſing,
ſo my farre fetcht, and as it were beyond ſea manner of
writing, if they would take as much paines for their poore
countrimen as for a proud ſtranger when they once vnderſtand
it, ſhould be much more gracious to their choice
conceiptes, then a diſcourſe that fals naked before them,
and hath nothing but what mixeth it ſelfe with ordinarie
table talke. For my varietie of new wordes, I haue none
Inckepot I am ſure you know, but ſuch as I giue paſport
with ſuch authoritie, ſo ſignificant and not ill ſounding,
that if my countrey language were an vſurer, or a man of
this age ſpeaking it, hee would thanke mee for enriching
him: Why alas will my young mayſter the reader affect
nothing common, and yet like nothing extraordinarie?
Swaggering is a new worde amongſt them, and rounde
headed cuſtome giues it priuiledge with much imitation,
being created as it were by a naturall Proſopopeia without
etimologie or deriuation; and why may not an elegancie
authentically deriued, & as I may ſay of the vpper houſe,
bee entertayned as well in their lower conſultation with
authoritie of Arte, as their owne forgeries lickt vp by nature?
All tongues haue inricht themſelues from their originall
(onely the Hebrew & Greeke which are not ſpoken
amongſt vs) with good neighbourly borrowing, and
as with infuſion of freſh ayre, and nouriſhment of newe
blood in their ſtill growing bodies, & why may not ours?
Chaucer (by whom we will needes authoriſe our true engliſh)
had more newe wordes for his time then any man
needes to deuiſe now. And therefore for currant wits to

crie from ſtanding braines, like a broode of Frogs from a
ditch, to haue the ceaſeleſſe flowing riuer of our tongue
turnde into their Frogpoole, is a ſong farre from their arrogation
of ſweetnes, & a ſin wold ſoone bring the plague
of barbariſme amongſt vs; which in faith needes not bee
haſtned with defences of his ignorant furtherers, ſince it
comes with mealemouth'd toleration too ſauagely vpon
vs. To be ſhort; ſince I had the reward of my labours in
their conſummation, and the chiefe pleaſure of them in
mine owne profit, no young preiudicate or caſtigatorie
braine hath reaſon to thinke I ſtande trembling vnder the
ayry ſtroke of his feuerie cenſure, or that I did euer expect
any flowing applauſe from his drie fingers; but the ſatiſfaction
and delight that might probably redound to euerie
true louer of vertue I ſet in the ſeat of mine owne profit
and contentment; and if there be any one in whome
this ſucceſſe is enflowred, a few ſprigges of it ſhall bee my
garland. Since then this neuer equald Poet is to bee vnderſtood,
and ſo full of gouernment and direction to all
eſtates; ſterne anger and the affrights of warre, bearing
the mayne face of his ſubiect; ſoldiers ſhall neuer ſpende
their idle howres more profitablie, then with his ſtudious
and induſtrious peruſall; in whoſe honors his deſerts are
infinite: Counſellors haue neuer better oracles then his
lines: fathers haue no morales ſo profitable for their children,
as his counſailes: nor ſhal they euer giue them more
honord iniunctions, then to learne Homer without book,
that being continually conuerſant in him, his height may
deſcend to their capacities, and his ſubſtance proue their
worthieſt riches. Huſbands, wiues, louers, friends, and
allies, hauing in him mirrors for all their duties; all ſortes
of which concourſe and ſocietie in other more happy ages,

haue in ſteed of ſonnets & laſciuious ballades, ſung his
Iliades. Let the length of the verſe neuer diſcourage your
endeuours: for talke our quidditicall Italianiſtes of what
proportion ſoeuer their ſtrooting lips affect; vnleſſe it be in
theſe coopplets, into which I haue haſtely tranſlated this
Shield, they ſhall neuer doe Homer ſo much right, in any
octaues, canzons, canzonets, or with whatſoeuer fuſtian
Epigraphes they ſhall entitle their meaſures. Onely the
extreame falſe printing troubles my conſcience, for feare
of your deſerued diſcouragement in the empaire of our
Poets ſweetnes; whoſe generall diuinitie of ſpirit,
clad in my willing labours (enuious of none
nor detracting any) I commit to your
good nature and ſolid
capacitie.

               BRight footed Thetis did the Spheare aſpire,
            (Amongſt th' Immortals) of the God of fire,
            Starrie, incorruptible, and had frame
            Of ruddie braſſe, right ſhaped by the lame.
            She found him at his ſwelling bellowes ſweating
            And twenty Tripods ſeriouſly beating,
            To ſtand and beautifie his royall hall,
            For chaires of honour, round about the wall,
            And to the feet he fixt of euerie one
            Wheeles of man-making gold to runne alone
            To the Gods Temples; to the which they were
            Religious ornaments, when ſtanding there
            Till ſacrifice were done, they would retyre
            To Vulcans houſe, which all eyes did admire:
            Yet the Dedalean handles to hold by
            Were vnimpoſde, which ſtraite he did apply.
            Theſe while he faſhiond with miraculous Art,
            The fayre white-footed dame appearde apart
            To Charis with the rich-attyred head,
            Whoſe heauenly beauties ſtrowd the nuptiall bed
            Of that illuſtrate Smith: ſhe tooke her hand
            And entertained her with this kind demand,
            What makes the Goddeſſe with the ample traine,
            
               
(Reuerend and friendly Thetis) entertaine
            Conceipt to honour vs with her repaire,
            That neuer yet was kind in that affaire?
            But enter further, that ſo wiſht a gueſt
            May be receiu'd with hoſpitable feaſt.
            Thus led ſhe Thetis to a chaire of ſtate,
            Rich and exceedingly elaborate,
            And ſet a footſtoole at her ſiluer feet;
            Then cald her famous Smith; Vulcan my ſweet,
            
               Thetis in ſome vſe needes thy fierie hand:
            He anſwerd, Thetis hath a ſtrong command
            Of all my powers; who gaue my life defence,
            Caſt by my mothers wilfull impudence
            Out of Olimpus; who would haue obſcur'd
            My natiue lamenes; then had I endurde
            Vnhelped griefes, if on her ſhining breſt,
            Hoſpitious Thetis had not let me reſt,
            And bright Eurinome, my Guardian,
            Faire daughter of the labouring Ocean,
            
            With whom nine yeares I wrought vp diuers thinges
            Buttons and bracelets, whiſtles, chaines, and rings,
            In concluſe of a Caue; and ouer vs,
            The ſwelling waues of old Oceanus,
            
            With fomie murmure flowd, and not a God,
            Nor any mortall knew my cloſe abode,
            But Thetis and diuine Eurinome,
            
            Who ſuccord me; and now from gulphy ſea
            To our ſteepe houſe hath Thetis made aſcent,
            To whom requitall more then competent,
            It fits me much my ſafetie ſhould repay;
            
               Charis do thou ſome ſumptuous feaſt puruay,
            Whiles I my ayrie bellowes may lay by,
            
               
And all my tooles of heauenly ferrarie.
            Thus from his anuile the huge monſter roſe,
            And with diſtorted knees he limping goes
            To a bright cheſt, of ſiluer Ore compoſde,
            Where all his wonder-working tooles were cloſde,
            And tooke his ſighing bellows from the fire;
            Then with a ſpunge, his breaſt with hayres like wire,
            His brawned necke, his hard handes and his face
            He clenſde; put on his robe, aſſumde his mace,
            And halted forth, and on his ſteps attended
            Handmaides of gold that with ſtronge paces wended,
            Like dames in flowre of life; in whom were mindes
            Furniſht with wiſedome, knowing all the kinds
            Of the Gods powers; from whom did voyces flie,
            In whom were ſtrengthes, and motions voluntary.
            Theſe at his elbow euer miniſtred:
            And theſe (drawing after him his legges) he led
            To Thetis ſeated in a ſhining throne,
            Whoſe hand he ſhooke and askt this queſtion.
            What wiſht occaſion brings the ſeas bright Queen
            To Vulcans houſe, that euer yet hath beene
            So great a ſtranger? ſhew thy reuerend will,
            Which mine of choyce commands me to fulfill,
            If in the reach of all mine Arte it lie,
            Or it be poſsible to ſatisfie?
            
               Thetis powrd out this ſadreply in teares:
            O Vulcan is there any Goddeſſe beares
            (Of all the deities that decke the skie)
            So much of mortall wretchednes as I,
            Whom Ioue paſt all depriues of heauenly peace?
            My ſelfe of all the blew Nereides,
            
            He hath ſubiected to a mortals bed,
            
               
Which I againſt my will haue ſuffered
            To Peleus ſurnamed Aeacides,
            
            Who in his court lies ſlaine with the diſeaſe
            Of wofull age; and now with new infortunes
            He all my ioyes to diſcontents importunes
            In giuing me a ſonne, chiefe in renowne
            Of all Heroes; who hath palme-like growne,
            Set in a fruitfull ſoyle; and when my care
            Had nurſt him to a forme ſo ſingulare,
            I ſent him in the Grecians crooke-ſternd fleete
            To Ilion, with the ſwiftnes of his feete,
            And dreadfull ſtrength, that his choyce lims indude
            To fight againſt the Troian fortitude:
            And him I neuer ſhall receyue retirde,
            To Peleus court; but while he liues inſpirde
            With humaine breath, and ſees the Suns cleare light.
            He muſt liue ſad and moodie as the night.
            Nor can I cheer him, ſince his valures price
            Reſignde by all the Grecians comprimiſe,
            
               Atrides forſt into his fortunes part
            For which, Conſumption tires vppon his hart:
            Yet ſince the Troians, all the Greekes conclude
            Within theyr forte, the Peeres of Greece haue ſude
            With worthynes of gifts and humble prayers,
            To winne his hand to harten their affayres
            Which he denyde: but to appeaſe theyr harmes,
            He deckt his dear Patroclus in his armes
            And ſent him with his bandes to thoſe debates:
            All daye they fought before the Scaean gates
            And well might haue expugnde, by that black light,
            The Ilian Cittie, if Appollos ſpight,
            Thirſting the blood of good Menetius ſonnes
            
               
Had not in face of all the fight foredone
            His faultleſſe life; and authord the renowne
            On Hectors proweſſe, making th' act his owne:
            Since therefore, to reuenge the timeleſſe death
            Of his true friend, my ſonne determineth
            T'embrue the field; for want whereof he lies
            Buried in duſt, and drownde in miſeries:
            Hereat thy knees I ſue, that the ſhort date
            Prefixt his life by power of enuious fate
            Thou wilt with heauenly armes grace and maintaine
            Since his are loſt with his Patroclus ſlaine.
            He anſwerd, be aſſurde, nor let the care
            Of theſe deſires thy firmeſt hopes empaire:
            Would God as farre from lamentable death,
            When heauie fates ſhall ſee it with his breath,
            I could reſerue him, as vnequald armes,
            Shal be found neere t'auert all inſtant harmes,
            Such armes as all worlds ſhall for art admire,
            That by their eyes their excellence aſpire.
            This ſaid, the ſmith did to his bellowes goe,
            Set them to fire, and made his Cyclops blow:
            Full twentie paire breathd through his furnace holes
            All ſorts of blaſtes t'enflame his temperd coles,
            Now bluſterd hard, and now did contrariſe,
            As Vulcan would, and as his exerciſe
            Might with perfection ſerue the dames deſire.
            Hard braſſe and tinne he caſt into the fire,
            High-priſed gold and ſiluer, and did ſet
            Within the ſtocke, an anuile bright and great:
            His maſsie hammer then his right hand held,
            His other hand his gaſpingtongues compeld.
            And firſt he forgde a huge and ſolid Shield,

            A ſiluer handle; fiuefold proofe it was,
            And in it many thinges with ſpeciall grace,
            And paſsing arteficiall pompe were grauen;
            In it was earthes greene globe, the ſea and heauen,
            Th'vnwearied Sunne; the Moone exactly round,
            And all the ſtarres with which the skie is crownd,
            The Pleyades, the Hyads, and the force
            Of great Orion; and the Beare, whoſe courſe
            Turnes her about his Sphere obſeruing him
            Surnam'de the Chariot, and doth neuer ſwimme
            Vpon the vnmeaſur'de Oceans marble face,
            Of all the flames that heauens blew vayle enchace.
            In it two beautious Citties he did build
            Of diuers languag'd men; the one was fild
            With ſacred nuptialles and with ſolemne feaſtes,
            And through the ſtreetes the faire officious gueſts,
            Lead from their brydall chambers their faire brides
            With golden torches burning by their ſides.
            
               Hymens ſweet triumphes were abundant there,
            Of youthes and damzels dauncing in a Sphere;
            Amongſt whom masking flutes & harps were heard,
            And all the matrones in their dores appearde,
            Admiring their enamored braueries;
            Amongſt the reſt buſie contention flies
            About a ſlaughter; and to ſolemne Court
            The Cittizens were drawne in thicke reſort,
            Where two contended for a penaltie:
            The one due ſatisfaction did deny,
            At th'others hands for ſlaughter of his friend,
            
               
The other did the contrarie defend:
            At laſt by arbitration both deſirde,
            To haue their long and coſtly ſuit expirde,
            The friends caſt ſounds confuſde on eyther ſide,
            Whoſe tumult ſtraight the Herraldes pacifide.
            In holy circle and on poliſht ſtones,
            The reuerend Iudges made their ſeſsions,
            The voycefull Herralds awfull ſcepters holding,
            And their graue doomes on eyther ſide vnfolding.
            In middeſt two golden talents were propoſde
            For his rich ſee by whom ſhould be diſcloſde
            The moſt applauſiue ſentence: th'other towne
            Two hoſte beſiegde, to haue it ouerthrown,
            Or in two parts to ſhare the wealthy ſpoyle,
            And this muſt all the Cittizens aſſoyle.
            They yeeld to neyther but with cloſe alarme,
            To ſallies and to ambuſcados arme,
            Their wiues and children on their walles did ſtand,
            With whom and with the old men they were mand.
            The other iſſude; Mars and Pallas went,
            Propitious Captaaines to their braue intent.
            Both golden did in golden garments ſhine
            Ample and faire, and ſeemde indeede diuine.
            The ſoldiers were in humbler habites deckt.
            When they had found a valley moſt ſelect,
            To couch their ambuſh, (at a riuers brinke
            Where all their heards had vſuall place to drinke)
            There (clad in ſhining ſteele) they cloſe did lie,
            And ſet farre off two ſentinels to ſpie,
            When all their flocks and crooke-hancht heards came neere
            Which ſoone ſucceeded and they followed were
            By two poore heardſmen that on bagpipes plaid,
            
               
Doubtleſſe of any ambuſcados laid:
            The ſentinels gaue word, and in they flew,
            Tooke heards and flockes, and both their keepers ſlew.
            The enemie hearing ſuch a ſtrange vprore
            About their cattell; being ſet before
            In ſolemne counſell, inſtantly tooke horſe,
            Purſude and at the flood, with mutuall force,
            The conflict ioynd; betwixt them flew debate,
            Diſorderd Tumult, and exitial Fate;
            Here was one taken with wounds bleeding greene,
            And here one pale, and yeelding, no wound ſeene:
            Another ſlaine; drawne by the ſtrengthles heeles
            From the red ſlaughter of the ruthles ſteeles,
            And he that ſlew him on his ſhoulders wearing
            His bloodieweedes as trophies of his daring.
            Like men aliue they did conuerſe in fight,
            And tyrde on death with mutuall appetite.
            He carude beſides a ſoft and fruitfull field,
            Brode and thrice new tild in that heauenly ſhield,
            Where many plowmen turnd vp here and there
            The earth in furrowes, and their ſoueraigne neere
            They ſtriu'd to worke; and euery furrow ended
            A bowle of ſweeteſt wine hee ſtill extended
            To him that firſt had done; then turnde they hand,
            Deſirous to diſpatch that peece of land,
            Deep and new earde; black grew the plow with mould
            Which lookt like blackiſh earth though forgd of gold.
            And this he did with miracle adorne.
            Then made he grow a field of high-ſprung corne,
            In which did reapers ſharpned ſickles plie:
            Others, their handfulles falne confuſedly
            Laid on the ridge together; others bound
            
               
Their gatherd handfulles to ſheaues hard and round
            Three binders were appointed for the place,
            And at their heeles did children gleane apace,
            Whole armefulles to the binders miniſtring.
            Amongſt all theſe all ſilent ſtood their king,
            Vpon a balke, his Scepter in his hand,
            Glad at his heart to ſee his yeeldie land.
            The herraldes then the harueſt feaſt prepare,
            Beneath an Oke far off, and for their fare,
            A mightie Oxe was ſlaine, and women dreſt
            Store of white cakes, and mixt the labourers feaſt.
            In it beſides a vine yee might behold
            Loded with grapes, the leaues were all of gold,
            The bunches blacke and thicke did through it growe,
            And ſiluer props ſuſtainde them from below:
            About the vine an azure dike was wrought,
            And about it a hedge of tinne he brought.
            One path went through it, through the which did paſſe
            The vintagers, when ripe their vintage was.
            The virgines then and youthes (childiſhly wiſe)
            For the ſweet fruit did painted cuppes deuiſe,
            And in a circle bore them dauncing round,
            In midſt whereof a boy did ſweetly ſound
            His ſiluer harpe, and with a piercing voyce,
            Sung a ſweete ſong; when each youth with his choice
            Triumphing ouer earth, quicke daunces treades.
            A heard of Oxen thruſting out their heades
            And bellowing, from their ſtalles ruſhing to feed
            Neere a ſwift flood, raging and crownd with reed,
            In gold and tinne he carued next the vine,
            Foure golden heardſemen following; heard-dogsni.
            Waiting on them; in head of all the heard,
         
         
            
            To my admired and ſoule-loued friend
Mayſter of all eſſentiall and true knowledge,
M. Harriots.
            TO you whoſe depth of ſoule meaſures the height,
            And all dimenſions of all workes of weight,
            Reaſon being ground, ſtructure and ornament,
            To all inuentions, graue and permanent,
            And your cleare eyes the Spheres where Reaſon moues;
            This Artizan, this God of rationall loues
            Blind Homer; in this ſhield, and in the reſt
            Of his ſeuen bookes, which my hard hand hath dreſt,
            In rough integuments I ſend for cenſure,
            That my long time and labours deepe extenſure
            Spent to conduct him to our enuious light,
            In your allowance may receiue ſome right
            To their endeuours; and take vertuous heart
            From your applauſe, crownd with their owne deſert.
            Such crownes ſuffice the free and royall mind,
            But theſe ſubiected hangbyes of our kind,
            Theſe children that will neuer ſtand alone,
            But muſt be nouriſht with corruption,
            Which are our bodies; that are traitors borne,
            To their owne crownes their ſoules: betraid to ſcorne,
            To gaudie inſolence and ignorance:
            By their baſe fleſhes frailties, that muſt daunce,
            Prophane attendance at their ſtates and birth,
            
               
That are meere ſeruants to this ſeruile earth,
            Theſe muſt haue other crownes for meedes then merits,
            Or ſterue themſelues, and quench their fierie ſpirits.
            Thus as the ſoule vpon the fleſh depends,
            Vertue muſt wait on wealth; we muſt make friends,
            Of the vnrighteous Mammon, and our ſleights,
            Muſt beare the formes of fooles or Paraſites.
            Rich mine of knowledge, ô that my ſtrange muſe
            Without this bodies nouriſhment could vſe,
            Her zealous faculties, onely t'aſpire,
            Inſtructiue light from your whole Sphere of fire:
            But woe is me, what zeale or power ſoeuer
            My free ſoule hath, my body will be neuer
            Able t'attend: neuer ſhal I enioy,
            Th'end of my happles birth: neuer employ
            That ſmotherd feruour that in lothed embers,
            Lyes ſwept from light, and no cleare howre remembers.
            O had your perfect eye Organs to pierce
            Into that Chaos whence this ſtiffled verſe
            By violence breakes: where Gloweworme like doth ſhine
            In nights of ſorrow, this hid ſoule of mine:
            And how her genuine formes ſtruggle for birth,
            Vnder the clawes of this fowle Panther earth.
            Then vnder all thoſe formes you ſhould diſcerne
            My loue to you, in my deſire to learne
            Skill and the loue of skill do euer kiſſe.
            No band of loue ſo ſtronge as knowledge is:
            Which who is he that may not learne of you,
            Whom learning doth with his lights throne endow?
            What learned fields pay not their flowers t'adorne
            Your odorous wreathe? compact, put on and worne,
            By apt and Adamantine induſtrie,
            
               
Propoſing ſtill demonſtrate veritie,
            For your great obiect, farre from plodding gaine,
            Or thirſt of glorie; when abſurd and vayne,
            Moſt ſtudents in their whole inſtruction are,
            But in traditions meere particular:
            Leaning like rotten howſes, on out beames,
            And with true light fade in themſelues like dreames.
            True learning hath a body abſolute,
            That in apparant ſence it ſelfe can ſuite,
            Not hid in ayrie termes as if it were
            Like ſpirits fantaſtike that put men in feare,
            And are but bugs form'd in their fowle conceites,
            Nor made forſale glaſ'd with ſophiſtique ſleights;
            But wrought for all times proofe, ſtrong to bide preaſe,
            And ſhiuer ignorants like Hercules,
            
            On their owne dunghils; but our formall Clearkes
            Blowne for profeſſion, ſpend their ſoules in ſparkes,
            Fram'de of diſmembred parts that make moſt ſhow,
            And like to broken limmes of knowledge goe.
            When thy true wiſedome by thy learning wonne
            Shall honour learning while there ſhines a Sunne;
            And thine owne name in merite; farre aboue,
            Their Timpanies of ſtate that armes of loue,
            Fortune or blood ſhall lift to dignitie;
            Whome though you reuerence and your emperie,
            Of ſpirit and ſoule, be ſeruitude they thinke
            And but a beame of light broke through a chink
            To all their watriſh ſplendor: and much more
            To the great Sunne, and all thinges they adore,
            In ſtaring ignorance: yet your ſelfe ſhall ſhine
            Aboue all this in knowledge moſt diuine,
            And all ſhall homage to your true-worth owe,
            
               
You comprehending all, that all, not you
            And when thy writings that now errors Night
            Chokes earth with miſtes, breake forth like eaſterne light,
            Showing to euery comprehenſiue eye,
            High ſectious brawles becalmde by vnitie,
            Nature made all tranſparent, and her hart
            Gripte in thy hand, cruſhing digeſted Art
            In flames vnmeaſurde, meaſurde out of it,
            On whoſe head for her crowne thy ſoule ſhall ſitte.
            Crownd with Heauens inward brightnes ſhewing cleare,
            What true man is, and how like gnats appeare.
            O fortune-gloſſed Pompiſts, and proud Miſers,
            That are of Arts ſuch impudent deſpiſers;
            Then paſt anticipating doomes and skornes,
            Which for ſelfe grace ech ignorant ſubornes,
            Their glowing and amazed eyes ſhall ſee
            How ſhort of thy ſoules ſtrength my weake words be,
            And that I do not like our Poets preferre
            For profit, praiſe and keepe a ſqueaking ſtirre
            With cald on muſes to vnchilde their braines
            Of winde and vapor: lying ſtill in paynes,
            Of worthy iſſue; but as one profeſt
            In nought but truthes deare loue the ſoules true reſt.
            Continue then your ſweet iudiciall kindneſſe,
            To your true friend, that though this lumpe of blindnes,
            This skornefull, this deſpiſde, inuerted world,
            Whoſe head is furie-like with Adders curlde,
            And all her bulke a poyſoned Porcupine,
            Her ſtings and quilles darting at worthes deuine,
            Keepe vnder my eſtate with all contempt,
            And make me liue euen from my ſelfe exempt,
            Yet if you ſee ſome gleames of wraſtling fire,
            Breake from my ſpirits oppreſſion, ſhewing deſire
            
               
To become worthy to pertake your skill,
            (Since vertues firſt and chiefe ſteppe is to will)
            Comfort me with it and proue you affect me,
            Though all the rotten ſpawne of earth reiect me.
            For though I now conſume in poeſie,
            Yet Homer being my roote I can not die.
            But leſt to vſe all Poeſie in the ſight,
            Of graue philoſophie ſhew braines too light
            To comprehend her depth of miſterie,
            I vow t'is onely ſtrong neceſſitie
            Gouernes my paines herein, which yet may vſe
            A mans whole life without the leaſt abuſe.
            And though to rime and giue a verſe ſmooth feet,
            Vttering to vulgar pallattes paſſions ſweet
            Chaunce often in ſuch weake capriccious ſpirits,
            As in nought elſe haue tollerable merits,
            Yet where high Poeſies natiue habite ſhines,
            From whoſe reflections flow eternall lines:
            
               Philoſophy retirde to darkeſt caues
            She can diſcouer: and the proud worldes braues
            Anſwere in any thing but impudence.
            With circle of her general excellence
            For ample inſtance Homer more then ſerueth,
            And what his graue and learned Muſe deſerueth,
            Since it is made a Courtly queſtion now,
            His competent and partles iudge be you;
            If theſe vaine lines and his deſerts ariſe
            To the high ſerches of your ſerious eyes
            As he is Engliſh: and I could not chuſe
            But to your Name this ſhort inſcription vſe,
            As well aſſurde you would approue my payne
            In my traduction; and beſides this vayne
            
               
Excuſe my thoughts as bent to others ames
            Might my will rule me, and when any flames
            Of my preſt ſoule break forth to their own ſhow
            Thinke they muſt hold engrauen regard of you.
            Of you in whom the worth of all the Graces,
            Due to the mindes giftes, might embrew the faces
            Of ſuch as ſkorne them, and with tiranous eye
            Contemne the ſweat of vertuous induſtrie.
            But as ill lines new fild with incke vndryed,
            An empty Pen with their owne ſtuffe applied
            Can blot them out: ſo ſhall their wealth-burſt wombes
            Be made with emptie Penne their honours tombes.
            FINIS.
