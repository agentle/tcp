            TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, AND RIGHT REVEREND Father in God, John, Biſhop of Lincolne, Lord Keeper of the Great Seale, and one of his Maieſties moſt Honourable priuy Councell.
            
               Right Honourable, my very ſingular good Lord;
            
            
               BEing incouraged by your Lordſhips fauorable acceptation of ſome ſmall Labours of mine, heretofore preſented vnto your Honour, I preſume to offer vp theſe few, but important and chiefe Articles of our Religion vnto your Lordſhips farther conſideration, as they are maintained and explained by Primitiue Fathers, knowne Papiſts, and ancient Manuſcripts, a threefold corde, which, in my coniecture, cannot eaſily be broken.
            As concerning the Manuſcripts, they are ancient, but not many; innominable as yet, but not long ſo to

continue, if their names can bee redeemed by any▪ meanes; and y t they cannot well be excepted againſt by the common Aduerſarie, being written long before Luther, Hus, VVicklife, or VVal

For the Papiſts, whoſe words and workes are often cited by me, though the Papiſts would ſeeme to elude their teſtimonies, or expunge their Sentences in th

Yet all the water in the maine Ocean will neuer be able to wiſh their teſtimonies out of our Bookes: Ours I call them, becauſe though bred and brought vp in the boſome of their Romane Church, they are but ſeeming Papiſts, ſo called, as Montes are a non mouendo, or Pa

            Laſtly, for the Fathers, whom they would faine make Partiaries, and defenders of their new and vpſtart opinions; it is not to bee marueiled, when they haue ſqueazed out the iuyce of their Bookes, Text, or Gloſſe, pared them to their purpoſes, and purged them to their

minds, or fancies rather: For if they alſo chance to erre, or miſ▪ſpeake in their iudgements (as the beſt haue failed ſometimes, and in ſome things) they haue a del

done before me contra Dextrarios & ſiniſtrarios.

            Of the ſufficiencie of the Holy Scripture for Saluation.
            
               HOLIE Scripture containeth all things neceſſary for ſaluation; ſo that whatſoeuer is not read therein, nor may be proued thereby, is not to bee required of any man, that it ſhould bee beleeued as an Article of faith, or be thought requiſite or neceſſary to ſaluation.
            In the name of the holy Scripture, wee do vnderſtand thoſe Canonicall bookes of the olde and new Teſtament; of whoſe authority was neuer any doubt in the Church.

               BY the complaint of diuerſe writers both old and new, the Scriptuees were too too much neglected, ſhall I ſay, or vtterly deſpiſed, generally of their Monkes, and Friars, Preachers, and others (as more opportunely ſhall be ſhewed in the handling of the eight propoſition) and therefore the Spirit of God which bloweth where it liſteth, and illuminateth whom it pleaſeth, raiſed vp ſome in priuate, ſome in publike, to be notable inſtruments of his glory.

                  I ſay, their watchmen are all blind, and yet as blind as they are they can ſee vaine and tranſitory things, thus we may interpret theſe words: they are blind in ſpirituall affaires, but quick-ſighted enough in temporall matters. It is ſaid in the Goſpell, the light of thy body is thy eye. Chriſts body is his Church, his eye is the holy Scripture, according vnto the ſaying of the Pſalmiſt: Thy word is a lanterne vnto my feete, &c. But in theſe preſent times, alacke for woe; there is an Amphora, a beame in their eyes, which by ſaecular and gainefull Sciences, take vpon them the rule and gouernance of the Church (which is his body) by traditions and ordinances of men. The weightie and ponderous talent of Lead, ſignifieth ſinne and ſaecular affaires, procured by couetouſneſſe. And at this preſent time, what is this talent of Lead, but their Priuiledges, Diſpenſations, and ſuch like, ſealed with Lead? The two women which lift this two eared pot betweene them, ſignifie pleaſure and vaine-glory, whereby many gather euill riches into their houſes. Their wings are like Kites: The Kite is a rauenous birde, houering vp and downe, to lye in waite for tame foule, or ſtinking carrion. So theſe couetous men, lye houering betweene heauen and earth, caſting about how they may get into their hands, whether it be by right or wrong, this tranſitory pelfe of the world: but their being is in the land of Sennaar, that is to ſay, in hell, whereis nothing but loathſome ſmelles, and gnaſhing of teeth. Out of theſe words wee inferre this, that many in thoſe dayes ſought after wealth, few after the Scripture, the light of their ſoules: few looked into this ☞ Sacra Scriptura ſpeculum eſt Dei, quo videtur ſacra hiſt.

It is a wholeſome doctrine, becauſe it agreeth with the word of God, and teaching of their owne men: full of comfort becauſe it doth not onely hope that we may be ſaued: but breeds y an aſſurance and confidence in our minds, that we imbrace Chriſt, and leaue the world truſt to Faith and diſclaime merit: which doctrine is not ſo to bee vnderſtood, as if Faith were barren without Good-workes, or that Good-workes were not to be followed of vs, if euer we meane to runne the way of ſaluation, which now come in the next Article to be examined.v † Quae iudicamus bona, recta intentione & feru nti facta, non protinus bona ſunt, ſi a nobis ſunt, ſed ſi a Deo, Faber in Math, p. 201.

            Of Goodworkes.

               nes and endure the ſeueritie of Gods iudgement: yet are they pleaſing and acceptable to God in Chriſt, and doe ſpring out of a liuely Faith, in ſo much that by them a liuely Faith may be euidently knowne, as a Tree diſcerned by the fruit.
            
               This Twelfth Article explained and maintained by the Papiſts.
               THere is no Article thoroughout all our Doctrine ſo much ſeandalized as this of Goodworkes. Our Aduerſarie the Deuill hath raiſed vp our Aduerſaries the Papiſts, to reproach the whole hoſte of Iſrael, and the God of Hoſtes, as if we lead men to looſeneſſe, taught men to eſchew Goodworkes, as ſinnes, and neuer ſo much as ſtudied the point of Sanctification: but looke into their Indices expurgatorij, hearken vnto their vnpartiall and moderate Papiſts, and the ſcandall will ceaſe, and this Article be cleered from imputation of calumny. For taking away all opinion of merit, all confidence in Goodworkes, making them acceſſarie after, and not neceſſarie before Iuſtification, embracing them as the fruit, and not as the root of a true and liuely Faith, and we will be as forward as they to aduance the doctrine of Goodworkes, as being inuolued within the doctrine of Faith, and incorporated in the Articles of our Religion proouing theſe Propoſitions.
               
                  1. That Goodworkes are the fruite of Faith, and follow after Iuſtification.
                  
                     2. That they cannot put away our ſinnes, and endure the ſeuerity of Gods iudgement.
                  3. That ſpringing out of a liuely Faith, they are pleaſing and acceptable to God in Chriſt, and are to be knowne no otherwiſe, then the Tree is diſcerned by the fruit.
               
            
            
               The Firſt Propoſition.
               That Goodworkes are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Iuſtification.

                  At that time alſo if an Acolythus came to a diſcreete Prieſt, and told him by way of Confeſſion, that hee had not (to ſay the truth) the gift of continency, it was but a veniall ſinne in the Confeſſour, to aduiſe his Confeſſee, to contract himſelfe with ſome one or other, in priuate ſort, & ſo deceiue his Dioceſan: for of two euils, the leſſe is to be choſen, and it is a leſſe fault for a Prieſt to marry priuatly, and to keepe his wife without ſcandall together with his benefice, then to keepe a Concubine againſt the expreſſe commandement of God. And put the caſe, that this man after this be compelled by his Dioceſan, to aſcend to holy orders, wee beleeue and aſſure ourſelues, that hee is in leſſe fault that keepes the company of his owne wife, than he that haunts an Harlots company: this is ſpoken of them that cannot containe.

            THe Kings Maieſtie hath the chiefe power in this Realme of England, and other his Dominions, vnto whom the chiefe gouernment of all the Eſtates of this Realme, whether they be Eccleſiaſticall or Ciuill, in all cauſes doth appertaine; and is not, nor ought to be ſubiect to any forraine iuriſdiction. Where we attribute to the Kings Maieſtie the chiefe Gouernment, by which title, we vnderſtand the minds of ſome ſlanderous folkes to be offended: we giue not to our Prince the miniſtring either of Gods Word, or of the Sacraments; the which thing the Iniunctions alſo ſet forth by Elizabeth our (late) Queene, do moſt plainely teſtifie. But that onely prerogatiue, which wee ſee to haue been giuen alwaies to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himſelfe; that is, that they ſhould rule all Eſtates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall, and reſtraine with the Ciuill ſword, the ſtubborne and euill doers.
            
               
               This thirtie ſeuenth Article explained and maintained by the Papiſts in theſe ſubſequent Propoſitions.

               2. Ouer all perſons, in all Cauſes, whether they be Eccleſiaſticall or Ciuill.

               The first Propoſition.
               The Kings Maieſtie hath the chiefe power in this Realme of England, and other his Dominions.
               I Muſt craue pardon of euery honeſt Reader, if I inlarge my papers in this point, and the propoſitions following, beyond my firſt propoſall; for that I take it to bee a piece of my alleageance, for me and all of my coate, not onely to oppoſe thoſe paper walles, but to interpoſe our deereſt liues betweene the King and danger (if need require). Danger there is, and euer will be to Kingly power, as long as their bloody Inquiſition-houſe ſhall ſtand at Rome: for if their tranſcendent and vniuſtifiable power be not limited, they will in time to come (if they may haue their willes, quod abſit) firſt, thruſt Kings out of their bookes, and then out of their Kingdomes. But the beſt is, nocumenta, documenta: his moſt excellent Maieſtie being forewarned, is forearmed, not only to preueut the danger by their bookes, but by their miſchieuous perſons, with a iuſt deleantur both out of his Kingdome and State. Wee may ſee their euill intents in their thrice accurſed Indices Expurgatorij. If a flower of

Regall authoritie do begin to bud forth, it is preſently nipped off with their vlcerous hands. For example; Place we the King according to our bounden duties, by the Lawes of God and men, in a Throne

                  Honore quolibet ſublimiorem quum habeat dignitatem: this doctrine was taught vs long agoe by Agapetus the Deacon, and other ancient Writers, whoſe ſteppes the Papiſts pretend to follow, and who but they, that ſeeme to reuerence their graue ſentences and gray haires? Neuertheleſſe, you ſee a croſſe in the Margent, and you ſhall find a Deleatur in their books, or a Caue, as if you had trod vpon a Serpent. I haue an ancient Manuſcript in my keeping, that made an hard ſhift to come vnto mee, (for he almoſt loſt his coate by the way): but ragged and torne as he is, he hath theſe words, which doe ſerue to bee written in letters of gold, becauſe they ſpeake the Supremacy in expreſſe tearmes, and accord with this our Article: ☞ Rex in Regno ſuo nullum ſupra ſe habebit.—vnde à Rege ferente ſententiam appellari in Regno ſuo non poteſt. nu. 29. p. 7. 
                  The King hath no liuing perſon aboue him in his Kingdome, who then dares appeale from him? Vnleſſe it be ſome traiterous Becket, or other, that paſſing the Seas, raiſed ſuch ſeas of trouble in this Kingdome, that he had welnigh ouerwhelmed both King and State, if the prouidence of God had not the better preſerued them, as may appeare in our Engliſh Stories. But leauing Becket to be fully diſplaied in all his colours, and prooued to bee (as he is) a notorious

                   Traytor, notwithſtanding all their ſhifts that would apologize for him, I proceed, and further ſhew, that there is iuſt occaſion giuen vs to feare, that if this old Manuſcript had lighted into the Papiſts hands, either this leafe ſhould haue bin purged or torne, or the whole booke made away, that it ſhould neuer haue come in euidence againſt them. For Manuſcripts as well as other books, whether Greeke or Latin, old or new, are the ſubiect, or obiectum adaequatum of their damnable, vnheard of, and Diabolicall cenſures. But to reſume my firſt Propoſition againe, that the Kings Maieſtie hath next vnder God the chiefe power in this Realme, is a

doctrine ſo harſh and diſtaſteful in their mouthes, that there is a Deleatur whereſoeuer it is found, non habet in terris ſe quicquam excelſius, He hath no man greater vpon earth, is ſhamefully put forth, and cleane turned out of an ancient Writer in their Bibliotheque of ancient Fathers. This very ſentence in other words, in † Cuius poteſtas Maieſtáſque ſecundum Deum maxima. 
                  Lud. Viues Epiſtle vnto King Henrie the eight, hath endured the like purgation, and is waſhed away cleane out of the booke. Now to grow to a concluſion: If the Papiſts doe ſo ill entreate Kings in their bookes, I leaue you to imagine what they would doe to their perſons, if they could as eaſily come by them? But, nouerint vniuerſi, I would haue all men know, that the more they corrupt, the leſſe they gaine in the iudgement of any indifferent Papiſt not too much Romanized: and of fauour, let me aske them this queſtion, and let them anſwere mee (if they can) vpon their conſciences: doe theſe ſentences that they haue cauſed to bee blotted and blurred, make againſt them, or not? If they doe not, they make themſelues ridiculous, by taking ſo much labour in vaine, (the

                  Claudius Eſpencaeus, a man of ſingular note, trencheth vpon this troubleſome queſtion, and decideth it thus; Hauing ſpoken of Saint Pauls omnis anima; Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers, expounded by Chryſoſtome, whether he bee Apoſtle or Euangeliſt, Prophet, Prieſt or Monke, (which expoſition is ſeconded by Theodoret, Theophylact, Oecumenius, and what Greeke Writer dares oppoſe againſt it▪
                  ) he inferreth theſe words: [Yea, Gregorie the firſt, Gregorie the Great, doth ingenuouſly acknowledge the Emperours ſoueraigntie, aſwell ouer the Prieſts (that fight Gods battels) as ouer the ſouldiers that warred vnder his conduct, Regiſt. lib. 2. Ep. 64. And after Gregorie and Chryſoſtome, Bernard, a late Writer, in his to Henrie Archbiſhop of Senes, Ep. 41. argueth after this manner out of the words, Euery ſoule: If euery ſoule, then yours: he that would haue you conceiue otherwiſe of theſe words, doth but deceiue you, follow not their counſels.

                  If Princes haue nothing to do with Religion, and ſacred buſineſſes, what makes ſo many Imperiall lawes and constitutions for Religion in the Code, Nouels, and Authentikes? And to what purpoſe doe wee reade of ſo many Royall Edicts and Parliaments in the Annals of all Chriſtian Princes

[As I heare, when thoſe horrible fires were lighted throughout all the kingdome of France, for the burning of men and women aliue: Oh, that was a matter of the Church, appertaining to Religion. But when there was ſpeech of reforming the Clergie, conforming Monkes to their primitiue orders, and ſending Nonreſidents home to their Cures to care for their flocks, that matter was not to be ſpoken of by the temporall Magiſtrate, it was to be treated of in a Councell, or before the Popes Holineſſe: for ſo I haue heard, and doe well remember, that our Biſhops were wont to diſtinguiſh after this manner; as if Princes were not to be zealous and carefull in point of Religion: but to commit the care thereof not only to men very indiſcreet, but altogether ignorant, and ſo to become meere executioners of their cruell deſignes; as if they were not ſonnes of our Mother the Church, and chiefe propugnators, propagators and defenders of the ſame.

                  Thus farre of Biſhops, Deanes, Abbots and Priors; the recitall of the reſt would fill the booke, and not much more ſatisfie the Reader, and therefore I forbeare to name them, and come now to ſhew how little the Pope of Rome, or his Buls were regarded of our Engliſh Iudges. There was an Act made againſt drawing cauſes to Rome, anno 27. Edw. 3. and a commandement giuen, anno 16. Edw. filij R. Edwardi, that no man ſhould alienate, ſell, or ſend any thing beyond the Seas; and how many were accordingly indited and committed: as Io. Ouerton to the Tower, Simon Mellercet to the Kings Bench, anno 28. Edw. 3. William Beuercot to the Marſhalſey, anno Regis filij Edwardi 17. And for the Popes Buls, how little were they regarded, or rather how greatly were the getters or procurers, their fautors and abettors, & thoſe that did but threaten to make vſe of them

puniſhed and cenſured? There was a proceeding with ſome ſeueritie againſt one, that threatned, he would get a Bull from the Pope, Anno 27. R. Henrici. There was likewiſe an Inquiſition indented, taken for thoſe that procured them, anno 20. Edw. 3. their Abettors, anno R. Edw. 4. and one that pleaded them was committed to priſon. So then thoſe that bought thoſe Buls at Rome (giuing Gold for Lead) found them ſtill Lead, and no better here in England, and neither Buls, Appeales Biſhops, or liberties of the Church, could protect them againſt the King, his Crowne and dignitie, Kings of England here, and (I truſt euer ſhall be able) to maintaine their ſoueraigne iuriſdiction within theſe Kingdomes, ouer all perſons, and in all cauſes, againſt all forreine iuriſdiction, which commeth next in order to bee handled.
               
            
            
               The Third Propoſition.
               The King is not ſubiect to any forraigne iuriſdiction.
               THe Pope pretends to be the Head of the Catholique Church, how rightly we ſhall ſee hereafter; I am ſure the King of England holdeth it by as good right, as the Law of God, and the Law of this Kingdome can giue him. I know it will bee preſently obiected, that King Henry the eighth being a violent King, tooke this title vpon him; they are certainely deceiued that either thinke or ſay it; and therefore to manifeſt this point the better, I will tell you my conceit how this matter was brought to paſſe, not without an eſpeciall prouidence of God, out of very vnlikely meanes. For, when King Henry the eighth was ſharpened againſt Luther, there wanted not ſome about him, that buzzed this into the Kings eares, that the doctrine of Martin Luther was nothing elſe but drawne from the hereticall propoſition of Iohn Wicklife, which was condemned long ſince in, and by his Vniuerſitie of Oxford. Whereupon

the King being tickled (becauſe the full knowledge of this at that time ſerued well for his purpoſe) preſently diſpatched Edward Leighton, one of his Chaplaines, and Batchelor of Diuinitie, with thoſe Letters to the Vniuerſitie of Oxford.
               
            
            
               By the King.

                  ritie;) the Inſtrument is made, and both it and the anſwere to the Kings Letters ſealed the ninth day of that very moneth. Amongſt thoſe Articles that were ſent vp, there were diuers that did mainly trench vpon the Popes power, which (as Wickliefe ſaid) were neither found, nor founded vpon Gods Word. What effects theſe Articles wrought in the Kings mind, I know not: but of one thing I am wel aſſured, that not long after, the King being at variance with the Pope, a Parliament was called with in two yeres, and a motion was made therein, that the King ſhould be declared Head of the Church: but his Maieſtie refuſed, till he had aduiſed with his Vniuerſities vpon that point; and whileſt the Parliament ſate, God (in whoſe hands the hearts of Princes are, ſo diſpoſing it), the King reflecting belike vpon Wickliefes former Articles, directing his Letters to the Vniuerſitie of Oxford, about the election of the Biſhop of Lincolne into the Chancellorſhip of the Vniuerſitie of Oxford, in the roome of Archbiſhop Warham, lately deceaſed; After the accompliſhment whereof (ſaith the King) Our pleaſure and commandement is, that ye, as ſhall be beſeeme men of vertue, and profound literature, diligently intreating, examining, and diſcuſſing a certaine queſtion, ſent from Vs to you, concerning the power and primacie of the Biſhop of Rome; ſend againe to Vs in writing vnder your common Seale with conuenient ſpeed and celeritie your mind, ſentence, and aſſertion of the quaeſtion, according to the meere and ſincere truth of the ſame, willing you to giue credence to Our truſty and welbeloued, this bringer, your Commiſſarie;

               Vpon the receipt of theſe Letters, the 
                     Ʋniuerſitie (at that time, for ought we know, conſiſting all of Papiſts) being aſſembled in Conuocation, decreed, as followeth: That for the examination, determination, and deciſion of this queſtion,
                  
                  ſent vnto them to be diſcuſſed from the Kings Maieſtie, viz Whether the Biſhop of Rome had any greater Iuriſdiction collated vpon him from God in the holy Scripture, in this Kingdome of England, than any other forraine Biſhop; that there ſhould be deputed thirtie Diuines, Doctors and Bachelors of Diuinitie of that facultie, to whoſe ſentence, aſſertion, or determination, or the greater part of them, the common Seale of the Vniuerſitie in the name thereof ſhould be affixed: prouided, that the queſtion ſhould bee firſt diſputed, and then ſent vp to his Maieſtie. And the 27. of Iune, in the yeere of our Sauiour 1534. this Inſtrument following was made, and ſent vp, ſealed with the common Seale of the Vniuerſitie. The Inſtrument it ſelfe is in Latine, in Engliſh thus.
               TO all the ſonnes of our Mother the Church, to whom theſe preſent Letters ſhall come, Iohn, by the grace of God, Chauncellor of the famous Vniuerſitie of Oxon, and the whole aſſembly of Doctors and Maſters, Regents and not Regents, in the ſame greeting. Whereas our moſt noble and mighty Prince and Lord, Henrie the eighth, by the grace of God, of England and France, King, Defender of the Faith, and Lord of Ireland; vpon the continuall requeſts and complaints of his Subiects exhibited vnto him in Parliament, againſt the intolerable exactions of forraine Iuriſdictions, and vpon diuers controuerſies had, and mooued about the Iuriſdiction and power of the Biſhop of Rome, and for other diuers & vrgent cauſes against the ſaid Biſhop then and there exponed and declared, was ſent vnto, and humbly deſired, that he would prouide in time ſome fit remedie, and ſatisfie the complaint of his deere Subiects. Hee, as a moſt prudent Salomon, minding the good of his Subiects, ouer whom God hath placed him; and deepely pondering

with himſelfe how he might make good and wholeſome Lawes for the gouernment of his Commonwealth; and aboue all things taking care, that nothing bee there reſolued vpon againſt the holy Scripture (which hee is, and euer will bee ready to defend with hazard of his deareſt blood) out of his deepe wiſdome, and after great paines taken hereabouts, hath tranſmitted, and ſent vnto his Vniuerſitie of Oxon, a certaine queſtion to be diſputed, viz. Whether the Biſhop of Rome hath any greater Iuriſdiction granted to him from God in the holy Scripture, to be exerciſed and vſed in this Kingdome, then any other forraine Biſhop; and hath commanded vs, that diſputing the queſtion after a diligent and mature deliberation and examination of the premiſſes, we ſhould certifie his Maieſtie vnder the common Seale of our Vniuerſitie, what is the true meaning of the Scriptures in that behalfe, according to our Iudgements and apprehenſions. Wee therefore the Chancellour, Doctors and Maſters aboue recited, daily and often remembring, and altogether weighing with our ſelues, how good and godly a thing it is, and congruous to our Profeſsion, be fitting our ſubmiſsions, obediences and charities, to foreſhew the way of truth and righteouſneſſe to as many as deſire to tread in her ſtepps, and with a good, ſure and quiet conſcience, to anchor themſelues vpon Gods Word; we could not but endeauour our ſelues with all the poſsible care that wee could deuiſe, to ſatisfie ſo iuſt and reaſonable a requeſt, ſo great a Prince (who, next vnder God, is our most happy and ſupreame Moderatour and Gouernour.) Taking therefore the ſaid queſtion into our conſiderations, with all humble deuotion, and due reuerence (as becommeth

vs) and aſſembling our Diuines together from all parts, taking time enough, and many dayes ſpace to deliberate thereof diligently, religiouſly, and in the feare of God, with zealous and vpright minds, firſt, ſearching, and ſearching againe, the Booke of God, and the beſt Interpreters and Commenters thereupon, diſputing the ſaid queſtions ſolemnely and publikely in our Schooles, haue in the end vnanimouſly, and with ioynt conſent reſolued vpon the Concluſion; that is to ſay, That the Biſhop of Rome hath no greater Iuriſdiction giuen vnto him in Scripture, then any other Biſhop in this Kingdome of England. Which our aſſertion, ſentence, or determination ſo vpon deliberation, maturely and throughly diſcuſſed, and according to the tenour of the Statutes and Ordinances of this our Vniuerſitie concluded vpon publikely in the name of the whole Vniuerſitie, we doe pronounce and teſtifie, to be ſure, certaine and conſonant to the holy Scripture. In witneſſe whereof we haue cauſed theſe our Letters to be written, ſealed, and ratified by the Seale of our Vniuerſitie. Yeuen in our Aſſembly-houſe the 27. of the moneth of Iune, in the yeere of Chriſt 1534.
               This Inſtrument being brought into the Parliament
                  houſe, an Act paſſed, whereby the King was declared Supreame Head and Gouernour of the Church. What exception? was it taken or giuen? The Parliament motioned ſome ſuch matter to the King; his Maieſtie wiſely referreth it to the Learned of his 
                     Ʋniuerſitie; the Vniuerſitie to thirty Delegats; the referrees returne their ioynt opinion to the King; that the Pope had no more to doe here in England, then any other forraine Biſhop: this their opinion was grounded on the Scripture; the places of Scripture confirmed by the expoſition of the beſt interpreters: the Parliament
                  
vpon full knowledge of this, baniſh all forraine Iuriſdiction out of the Realme, to the comfort of Gods Church, and the reliefe of his diſtreſſed ſubiects, which had ſo long been inthralled and groaned vnder this Baby loniſh captiuitie. What remaineth? If this be not ſatisfactorie, Ireferre you to the reading of three excellent pieces of this Argument, which I forbeare to inſert into this booke; firſt,
                     In my Coſen Richard Iames of C. C. C. of Beckets De-canononization, lib. 3. c 4 becauſe of prolixitie; ſecondly, becauſe ere long, you ſhall haue them all comprized in one volume. The firſt is taken out of Guicciardine, the ſecond out of Machiauell, the third out of Stephen Paſquier, quarit Recerches. The place in Guicciardine is ſhamefully expunged; that of Machiauell with the whole booke, and all his Workes forbidden; onely Paſquier is improhibited and vnpurged. But no thankes to the Inquiſitors, for feare leſt our French men, which are accounted loſt men at Rome, ſhould bee vtterly loſt from the Church of Rome, if the Inquiſitors went about to infringe their Pragmaticall Conſtitutions. Of theſe three witneſſes, two of them are without exception, Guicciardine and Paſquier: the third is branded for an Atheiſt, and (as I dare not make any Apologies for him, ſo many, and ſo great Schollers hauing faſtned this imputation vpon him) ſo I cannot but ſay (it is onely my coniecture) that if Machiauell had not touched the Popes free-hold, but ſuffered him to haue been a God vpon earth, Machiauell had been no Atheiſt for this booke, but might haue hoped rather to haue been a Cardinall: but how deadly ſoeuer they hated him, and interdicted his Workes, at his death (as it ſeemeth) he left his Machiaueliſmes to bee diſpoſed of by the Pope and his Cardinals, which haue made no ſmall vſe of his politike ends. But to reuert, the tenour of theſe afore recited places being read and peruſed, and thought vpon, may breed ſuch a vnitic in our Chriſtian Princes, that both Church and Commonwealths may be much the better for it. If I faile in my coniecture, yet my hopes and prayers ſhall ſtand good. And thus hauing plainely ſhewed the Kings Supremacie, and made him Head of the Church, let

vs ſee, what can be ſaid in defenſe of forraine Iuriſdiction; or, which is all one, for the Popes Primacie.
               
               Firſt, the Papiſts will pleade a deed of gift, or gift from Conſtantine the Great, a great gift, if it can bee prooued. It is regiſtred in their Canon-Law, (though the Record where it is, be ſomewhat doubted of; yet it is confirmed out of Geſta Sylueſtri,) which is (if I durſt belieue them) of an vndoubted truth. I anſwere; Firſt, the Donation, or gift it ſelfe, (I will giue them this gift before hand) is not found at all in all our Engliſh Copies, nor in Geſtis Sylueſtri. There antiquitie knowes them not; they muſt bee contented to forbeare to vrge this donation any longer. And I am mooued the rather to thinke ſo, becauſe by their own confeſſions, if this gift of all the Weſterne Prouinces, &c. were made to the Church (as is ſuggeſted,) doubtleſſe it was made by Sylueſters Conſtantine, vpon his Baptiſine. But what if this Story bee not true? Then it will follow very ſuantly, no Sylueſter, no Baptiſme; no Baptiſme, no ſuch Conſtantine; no ſuch Conſtantine, no Donation.

                  According to ſome Writers (ſaith he) this was not Conſtantine the Emperour, which was baptized and conuerted by Pope Sylueſter (as ſome other Hiſtories ſeeme to intimate, or inſinuate), but it was Conſtantinus, the father of this Conſtantine, as we find it recorded in other Hiſtories.

                  Rome (quoth he) carrying boughes of Palme in their hands, came vnto Pope Innocent, and offered vp the Keyes of their Citie, and granted vnto him the temporall Dominion of the Citie of Rome, neither mooued with any iuſt ground, neither are they to bee commended for it; ſith abundance of temporall things doth much hinder the progreſſe of ſpirituall affaires. Nor in truth ought the Pope himſelfe (though hee bee Peters ſucceſſour) take any ſuch temporall Dominion, that might intangle, or indanger his gouernment, into his hands. For it is not read in old time, ſince the time of Conſtantines Donation (wherewith all our Canoniſts, whom I muſt needs ſay, are too curious in this point, make themſelues merry), that any chiefe Biſhop did take vpon him the temporall Gouernment of the Citie of Rome. But of late dayes, and in the memory of man, ſome Popes procuring labour and trouble vpon themſelues, haue been ſo bold, as to intermeddle therewith.

Iſidorus, I confeſſe, in his Hiſtorie writeth, that Conſtantine quitted the Citie of Rome, leauing it to the Pope, and with it, his Imperiall Robes, Diadem, and white Horſe which he was wont to ride on, and beſtowed many dignities. What is all this to ſo great a Patrimony, as they ſay, of Peter, purchaſed by his leproſie, his cure thereof, by the blood of Infants, and his baptiſme by Sylueſter? Oh happy tales! which erected ſo great and large an Empire. Wee reade a certaine diſtich againſt Laurentius Valla, a man hated and perſecuted for the truth, labouring to prooue in a booke, now in the hands almoſt of euery one, that the Pope hath not any right or title granted to him of Empire, or temporall Gouernment, &c. So theſe honeſt men that are likely to bee impannelled vpon this Iurie, (and I will be bound to bring forth a full Iurie of theſe, if Iury Maſters of the Inquiſition doe not cut out their tongues, before they come to be produced either as witneſſes or Iurors;) or if they doe, they may happen to rue it, by that time we haue inquired (as diligent inquirie ſhall be made) either by writ, or by a dedimus poteſtatem. Do you know the danger? It is Fellony by the Statute, and villany vnexpiable. But if all that hath bin ſaid, cannot ſatisfie our Romane Catholikes about this their Donatiue, what if we be able to bring forth a plainer Surrender againe into the Emperours hands, of all that large Grant from Iuſtinian the Emperour, or Charles the Great, and why not from Conſtantine?

Writer, and what reaſon haue Proteſtants not to belieue it? This, I ſay, as not belieuing it much, becauſe (as I haue formerly ſhewed) their owne Authors doe diffide the Donation as much, or rather more then wee: but in caſe the Donation be prooued, and the witneſſes and teſtimonies againſt vs bee diſprooued, this ſhall ſerue to cloſe vp their ſtomacks.
               But the Papiſts ſay, they haue a better Grant from Chriſt Jeſus, the true Emperour of the whole World, on whoſe thigh is written this diuine Impreſa, Rex regum & Dominus Dominantium: the proofes taken out of the Scripture (the Proteſtants Carde) in diuers places of the New Teſtament, and ſome out of the Old, as Matth. 16. Thou art Peter, and vpon this Peter will I build my Church. And againe: To thee (Peter) will I giue the Keyes, &c. and againe: Ecce duo gladij; two Swords at once, to ſignifie two Empires, either of them two-edged, as well to ſtabliſh the Empire in the perſon of Peter, as to cut off all oppoſites, and all knots and difficulties, that are incident vnto theſe controuerſies.
               Touching, Thou art Peter; and, Vpon this Peter, &c. vnleſſe they get more by their Salt-peeter (as they are Deuils in the Vault) then by their Peter, they are not likely to get much, for the Popes either temporall or ſpirituall power out of this place: you muſt make your Peter either the Rocke of Faith, or the Rocke of Chriſt; or elſe you daſh againſt ſo many worthy and famous Writers of your own, as againſt ſo many rockes.

And thus hauing put vp your Swords, and ſhewed out of your owne beſt Writers, that theſe Keyes will not ſerue to open the way to any forraine Iuriſdiction, we cleaue faſt to the Rocke Christ, or faith; and doe certainely beleeue, that the Pope hath no temporall Iuriſdiction, either in this Land, or any other Country, out of the New Teſtament: as little helpe is there out of the places of the old; for in this very queſtion, you would be accounted like the good Houſholder in the Goſpel, that haue both old & new in ſtore for vs.

            Of the 22. Article.
            Of Purgatorie.
            
               THE Romiſh doctrine concerning Purgatorie, Prayers, worſhipping and adoration, as well of Images, as of Reliques, and alſo inuocation of Saints, is a fond thing, vainely inuented and grounded vpon no warrant of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.
            
               This 22. Article explained and maintained by Papists.
               HEre we are to runne through Purgatorie; or rather, through a Hell of deuiliſh inuentions; but I will contract my ſelfe and it. The Church of England giues no definition of it in this Article, neither can it be defined, becauſe non entis nullae ſunt qualitates: but out of the writings of moderate Papiſts, it may be deſcribed briefly thus:
               Purgatory is a prety ſlight to picke mens purſes.
               
            
            
               
               Largely thus.
               
                  PVrgatorie is an excellent inuention of fiction of ſome Cacologus, Schoolemen, or Legendaries, founded vpon dreames and reuelations, to certaine politick ends: partly vnknowne, partly knowne to picke mens purſes, and fill the Popes cofers, to defeate men of their lands, and rob their ſoules of true comfort, leauing nothing in mens conſciences but ſcruples and terrors, to thinke when it began, what it is, how long it ſhall continue, for yeares, dayes, moneths, or till the day of iudgement. This awing the people by it, more then by any thing, and cauſing them to reuerence their perſons more then any men; that can by their Prayers, mages, Inuocations, and Reliques of Saints, Indulgences, Funerals and Diriges (being well hired vnto the ſame,) quench this fire, deliuer theſe ſoules out of Purgatori, and free them a poena, and ſend them ſtraight into Paradiſe to their endleſſe ioy and comfort (as they thinke, and are perſwaded by their ignorant guides). To courſe ouer the parts of this deſcription. It is a meere fiction, not of their Theologus but of their

               Who ſhall goe thorow it? Whatſoeuer the fire is, (here is no certaine reſolution of the queſtion,) beleeued it must bee, that although all the faithfull children of God paſſe not thorow it, but theſe onely which perfected their penance in this life; yet with this diſtinction, that ſome ſoules ſhall be puniſhed more, ſome leſſe. Some ſoules ſhall bee deliuered from thence quickly in an inſtant. Some ſoules ſhall bee kept there priſoners till the laſt day of Iudgement, according as they doe penance, or ſinne; more or leſſe, and according to the manner of contrition.

If from that time, vntill the yeare 1300. it will appeare, that the vſe of them hath been ſparing, and onely to free men from puniſhments, impoſed by the Confeſſour. Afterwards, from the Councell of Ʋienna, the abuſes began, which did increaſe very much, vntill the time of Leo the tenth. Hitherto the Councell, and yet no Counſell neither; they ſay no more then all the World beſides; I meane, a world of Papiſts, which I haue catalogued vp according to the times where in they liued deſcendendo; I hope they are all fit and proper.

                  2. If there be, or put caſe there be; yet they are ill diſtributed, and as they are bought and ſold, cannot bee defended.
               
               Theſe two Propoſitions are maintained and explained by the Papiſts, to whoſe writings I haue confined my ſelfe, when I might (as you perceiue by that which hath been written) haue made vſe of a great many more teſtimonies, both pregnant and pertinent to my purpoſe: but theſe and a few Parchments ſhall ſuffice.

                  or put out the ſinnes of my people. Alſo Ambroſe; Hee, and none but he, forgiueth ſinnes, that died for thee. And Saint Auguſtine moſt elegantly concludes the Chorus in theſe words; No man can take away our ſinnes but Chriſt alone, which is the immaculate Lambe that taketh away the ſinnes of the World; hee taketh them away, both by pardoning them that are already committed, and by keeping vs from committing any more, and by bringing vs to heauen, where it is impoſſible to ſinne any more. More then this, what can be ſaid to take away the Keyes from the Pope, and giue them to the true owner, Chriſt? To point vs out with the finger, or to direct vs to the true Treaſure of the Church, the Merits of our Sauiour, the true Purgatorie of Chriſts blood: and thus much briefly of the firſt Propoſition.

After whoſe death, the whole Iland deuolued, vnto him. So much wemay reade in the Brittiſh Stories: but ſome there bee that fetch her pedigree and deſcent as farre as Treuers. Thus much a man may beleeue, although that he haue but ſome few graines or ſcruples of faith: But that which followeth, can hardly be beleeued, without ſome ſcruple of conſcience, though hee had whole mountaines of faith, or as much faith as would remooue Mountaines into the Sea; yet, I ſay, it will hardly be belieued.

                  then, then they doe now. Zachaeus was his Grandfather, and Saint Stephen that was ſtoned to death, was this Iudas brother: this Iudas (I ſay) when Queene Helena threatned to burne them all aliue, if they would not tell her; for all their ſolemne vow, was diſcouered to her to be the onely man, that knew where the Croſſe was hidden: ſo ſhe ſet them aſide, and tooke Iudas along with her, and told him in plaine termes, that if he would not tell her where Golgotha was, that the Croſſe might be found, eft ſoones ſhe would throw him into a pit, and there he ſhould lie (as ſure as Chriſt died for her) till hee were famiſhed to death: which was inſtantly done, and there hee lay poore ſoule ſixe dayes and ſixe
                  
                  nights: but on the ſeuenth day he made ſignes to come foorth, and made ſhow that he would tell them where the pretious Relique of the Croſſe was. As ſoone as hee came forth, downe falleth he to his prayers, (which that it might bee the more auaileable was ioyned with much faſting) ſtraight wayes whileſt he prayed, the ground ſhooke, and yeelded forth a ſent of moſt pleaſant ſmelles. Whereat Iudas lift vp both his hands, and ſaid; Now doe I know of a truth, that Chriſt is the Sauiour of the world. Now in that place (as we reade in the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie (for this is not a Legend-ſtorie) there was whilome a Temple of Venus, the Goddeſſe of luſt, built by Adrian the Emperour, wherein whoſoeuer prayed, might bee thought to pray to her Deitie, & therfore it was vnfrequented, and ready to fall: but Queene Helena razed it to the ground, and plowed it vp. After this Iudas begins to ſettle himſelf to his buſines, and hauing digged not paſſing 20. yards in the ground, he found three Croſſes, which with great ioy hee carried vnto Queene Helena. But loe, here a doubt, that did much perplex them all, it could not be known, which was Chriſts Croſſe, from the thiefes; nor of the two thieues Croſſes, which was the good thiefes, & which was the bads: but that mattered not. But as God would haue it, there was a young man carried forth to be buried; Iudas ſtaied the Beare with his band, and layed the firſt croſſe vpon the body, and it ſtirred not; and then he layed the ſecond croſſe vpon it, and it ſtirred not; but when he touched the body with the third Croſſe, the young man ſtarted vp; and if this bee not true, the Sea burnes. Would you know what became of this wonder-working Iudas? He was baptized not long after by the name of Quiriacus, and in time, anno nullo, regnante nemine, (the time certainely cannot be aſſigned) was made Biſhop of Ieruſalem, and was put to death by Iulian the Emperour, after moſt exquiſite torments. This Quiriacus vpon intreatie of the ſame Empreſſe, was ſo happy as to find out the Nayles, wherewith our Sauiour was crucified, gliſtering in the ground as it were any gold. How Helena diſpoſed of them, I leaue to Gregorius Turonenſis, and other Fablers to informe you:

for my part, I beleeue neither part, nor parcell of this Story, as it is here related: though I doe not denie, but ſuch Nailes might be found, and, perhaps, ſtucke in Conſtantines Helmet; and one of them was throwne into the Hadriatique Sea, which hath been the quieter euer ſince, neuer a whit: yet all this will not make me beleeue, that the Feaſt of the Inuention of the Croſſe, commonly called Holy-roode day, tooke its originall from this Iudas Helena. That which I inferre out of all this long and tedious legendarie Storie, (let the Papiſts eccleſiaſticate, and magnifie it neuer ſo much) is, that there is no certaintie, either of the one, or of the other. Next, touching the parts and parcels of the Virgin Maries Sepulchre, I will not ſay, that theſe are as certaine as her aſſumption, or her houſes tranſumption (both which are written in the backſide of my Creed:) but I will ſay confidently and peremptorily, that the Councel of

               BEfore wee enter into the maine controuerſie about Adoration of Images, let vs enter ſome Creekes thereof, and then lauch forth into the deepe; and as he that goeth

about to fell a Tree, that is compaſſed with Thornes and Buſhes at the bottome, muſt firſt cut or grub vp the buſhes, that hee may come at the tree: ſo wee will cut off certaine nice and thorny diſtinctions, that wee may the more freely come to throw downe this great tree of Images, which like Alex. Oke, is growne now to adoration, and ſpeciall worſhip. The diſtinctions are three, betweene ſimulachrum and imago, a ſimilitude or likeneſſe of a thing; an Idoll, an Image; and latria and doulia. The Papiſts as much as wee, condemne the worſhipping of Idols and ſimulachra, and all god-worſhip, or latria to Images of men; but not the worſhip, or adoration of Images in a meaner ſort, called doulia, or in a greater, called latria, of the Images of God, either alone, or in the Trinitie, or of the Croſſe, or of our bleſſed Sauiour that died vpon the Croſſe, both God and Man.

                  2. When they began to come into vſe, and crept into Churches, they were onely Lay-mens Remembrancers, not their Idols, or worſhipped of them.
                  
                     3. That when they began to be worſhipped (as Idolatrie commeth in ſtep by ſtep) Images of the Trinitie or of God the Father, were neuer generally receiued, but moſtly miſliked of the Church.

               The Firſt Propoſition.
               Images were not vſed in the Primitiue Church.
               IF Agobardus Works, and eſpecially his de Picturis, with Papyrius Maſſenius notes, and Deſiderius Heraldus annotations vpon Arnobius, bee not ſatisfying in this point, we ſhal be conſtrained to haue recourſe to the Writings of the Fathers, and the Hiſtories of the Church: out of both which, it will appeare as cleare, as the Sunne-ſhine at Noone-day, that the Prime-Chriſtians could ſay confidently, that they had no Altars, no Images nor Statuaes: making Images the badge or cognizance to know the Chriſtian from the Gentill; and who knoweth not that memorable Hiſtory of Epiphanius, recorded by Saint Hierome? Which Epiſtle you haue laboured what you can to diſcredit, and when you could not doe that, you fell foule vpon ſome few Notes of † Notati ab Epiphanio propter Imagines▪

                  Eraſmus, that declared the ſame. A poore reuenge: but that Epiſtle and the truth thereof doth ſtand, and your doctrine of Images muſt needs fall, vnleſſe it haue better proppes to maintaine it, then I ſee in this firſt Propoſition.
            
            
               
               The Second Propoſition.
               When Images came into the Church, they were placed in their Temples for rememoration, and not for adoration.
               THe Propoſition is ſo notorious and famous out of Gregories Epiſtle to Serenus of Maſſeils, that you were beſt blot out that Epiſtle, and coyne a doctrine cleane contrary to this, and clap it to ſome Epiſtle or other. And doubtleſſe (as you are cunning gameſters, that can helpe your ſelues at a need) yee haue played your parts very cunningly on both ſides. Saint Gregorie in his ninth booke and ninth Epiſtle to Serenus, Biſhop of Marſeils, blameth him for being ſo inconſiderate, as to breake certaine Images that were offenſiue, by reaſon of the peoples worſhipping them. Hee ſaith; Antiquitie knew of the painting of Saints Stories in places where men did worſhip God; although they did not worſhip pictures as gods, or as men. I reuerence S. Gregorie as much as any man, hauing peruſed his workes as much as ſome others haue done, and compared him with the Manuſcript Copies which (vnder correction) I take to bee the beſt reading of him, or any other Greeke or Latine Author. But theſe words, quia in locis venerabilibus Sanctorum depingi Hiſtorias non ſine ratione admiſit vetuſt as; hee ſaith but admiſit, permitted them to bee painted; and yet I can ſcarſely beleeue them, becauſe Epiphanius that liued ſome hundreds of yeares before Saint Gregorie, rent the Vayle in the Church: Was he inconſiderato zelo ſuccenſus, when he did it? Who dares ſay it? And both Tho. Bradwardine, our profound Doctor, and the Councell of Baſil, haue taught me how to diſtinguiſh betweene auctorities and auctorities, the former and the latter: and whereas it may be obiected for proofe hereof, that the Picture of our Sauiour was miraculouſly depaynted in the Lateran Church, as ſaith † Imago Saluatoria miraculoſe depicta in pariete Lateranenſis Eccleſiae ſi rectè ſentiunt qui haec ſcribunt.

take that which followeth; Sirectè ſentiunt qui haec ſcribunt; if that be true which is written of it. But to reuer
                     •
                   to my purpoſe: How doth this doctrine of Gregories, that Images may bee, but may not bee worſhipped, agree with that which went before in the ſeuenth booke of Greg. Regiſter. Indict. 2. ep. 54. to Secundinus? The words come not in by way of a Poſtſcript, Sic eſſe oportet; but they come in, or rather are thruſt in the percloſe of that long Epiſtle by head and eares. The Images (ſaith this falſe Gregorie) which you ſent for vnto me by Dulcidius the Deacon, I haue taken care to be conueyed vnto you. And it was no ſmall pleaſure vnto me, to ſee by this your liuely and earneſt affection to contemplate him, whoſe Image you deſired to haue before your bodily eyes, that ſeeing his picture, you might the better imprint him in your imagination. And verily it is not amiſſe done of vs, then to demonſtrate inuiſible things by viſible. Iuſt ſo a man that loueth and longeth to ſee his friend, or a man that truly loues his wife, maketh all the haſte he can, to ſee, the husband his wife, the man his friend, comming from the Church or the Bath, and doth both meet them ſome part of the way, and reioyce with exceeding great ioy. I perceiue by this, that you are much inflamed with the loue of your Sauiour, becauſe you haue ſuch a longing after his Image. And yet I would not haue you to conceiue, that wee are ſo groſſe, as to worſhip the Image as a god: no, no; we worſhip God by the Image, who was crucified, dead and buried, and now ſitteth at the right hand of God, as we are well taught in the Creed. For whileſt the outward picture, or Scripture, repreſenteth the Image to our bodily eyes, the eyes of our minds take great comfort in his glorious Reſurrection and bleſſed Paſſion. In conſideration whereof, we haue cauſed to be ſent vnto you two ſultaries or tables, wherein are painted the Images of God the Sauiour, and of the bleſſed Ʋirgin, the Mother of God, and of the bleſſed Apoſtles, Peter and Paul, by our foreſaid ſonne and Deacon. You ſhall likewiſe receiue a Croſſe and a Key, that hath been hallowed vpon the body of S. Peter, the chiefe of the Apoſtles, that being thus croſſed, and thus keyed, you may bee
                  
                  ſufficiently defended from all euill. Now let vs reſt a while, and be thinke our ſelues; firſt, for the time: It was written a yeare or two before the other to Serenus; and if this better had been true, Gregorie had good cauſe indeed to find fault with his inconſiderate raſhneſſe, that would offer to touch, much more to betrample and breake ſuch precious Reliques▪
                   but Gregory diſtinguiſheth adoration from rememoration; and at the moſt, he maketh Images but Laymens bookes: but this Secundinus, to whom he writeth is a ſeruant of God, an Incluſe, or Recluſe: and laſt of all, I muſt be bold to tell you this, that this Epiſtle is not found in any of our ancient Manuſcripts, ſaue ☞ Out of a

                  Gregories ſentence, or Gregories opinion taken out of the Decrees of Canons. So then, if Dominicus Baſa, or the Cardinals deputed for the reuiſing and printing of the Fathers out of the 
                     Ʋatican Print, were ſo bold as to mend Gregory out of Gratian, or the Decrees; I ſay vnder correction, they were more bold then wiſe, and wee are like to haue the Fathers Workes well amended, that are reuiſed after this manner. Againe, it muſt be duly conſidered, that Gregory in the Manuſcripts, wrote fourteene bookes of Epiſtles, diſtributed and ranked according to the yeares that he ſate Pope: but you haue confounded the Epiſtles, and made but twelue books (wherin notwithſtanding, there is hyſteron proteron I know not how often) ſo that the ſtory of things is much obſcured thereby. Howſoeuer, either Gregory doth contradict that in the ninth booke, and ninth Epiſtle, which he had formerly ſaid in his ſeuenth booke, touching the vſe and adoration of Images: but the truth is, this is a patched Epiſtle, and it appeareth out of the Goſpell, that a new piece put to an old garment, will make the rent worſe. I conclude this Propoſition out of learned Papiſts words: To vſe Images for adoration and worſhip, were to abuſe

               I Say, it is not onely vnlawfull, but alſo impoſſible; cui me aſſimilaſtus? yet you (as if you had better eyes then other men, or had been ſnatched vp with Saint Paul, into the vpper Heauen, and taken full view of the glorious Maieſtie of God) haue taken vpon you to paint God with three faces, as noteth a good † Alb.

                  PEnance is one of the ſeuen Sacraments, ſay the Papiſts; it is no Sacrament, ſaith the Church of England.

               It is eaſier to ſay what it is not, then what it is. But I will not greatly ſtand with them for a Sacrament, vpon hope of better agreement in other matters of greater conſequence: take it ſtrictly, it is no Sacrament, (they haue better eyes then I, if they can ſee more Sacraments then two in the Goſpell;) take it largely, it may paſſe well enough for a Sacrament, ſuch a one as it is: and to gratifie the Papiſts, if the number of ſeuen be ſo gratefull vnto them, I will helpe them vnto ſeuen times ſeuen Sacraments, vpon reaſonable conditions, out of Saint Auſten.

               Againſt Auricular confeſsion.
               IF auricular, or ſecret confeſſion be not abuſed, the Church of England doth willingly admit of, and ſubſcribe to it: the neglect of it hath been inquired of my knowledge, in ſome Viſitations; and the reuealing of it, is forbidden vnder an high paine: but this muſt not be impoſed of neceſſitie, but arbitrarie and voluntarie. The ſicke Penitent may ſay vnto the Confeſſour, I haue need of the Phyſitian; and the Confeſſour may reioyne vnto the Penitent, Non habeo praeceptum ſed conſilium do: I vrge it not vpon you as a precept, but I aduiſe you as a friend, and as your ſpirituall Paſtor; and if you be truly contrite (God ſeeth your heart, I ſee but your face) you may receiue comfort at Gods hands, and I will ioyne my heartieſt prayers with yours, for the obtaining of the ſame. Man is ſinnefull, but God is mercifull.
               To conſider Confeſſion a little better, it is a moſt forceable weapon, to amaze and amate the conſcience, to picke the purſe, and ſteale into a mans priuieſt thoughts, intruding here vpon Gods office; it maketh the Confeſſour (eſpecially if he be a young man) a knaue, women whores, and their husbands Cuckolds: Subiects rebell againſt their Princes, worketh Stratagems in States: to bee ſhort, it ſerueth (to my ſeeming) but to Politick ends, and in ſpeciall, it tyeth the Laytie faſt by the eares to the Cleargie, and the Cleargie to the Pope, which thereby is become, Rex Regum, et Dominus Dominantium.
               
               Touching the firſt part of this deſcription, how is the pore conſcience racked and torne, vexed and perplexed amongſt them? They require an exact Catalogue and enumeration of all ſinnes, and all circumſtances. I thinke it to be

                  there needes no ſuch matter: may it not ſuffice to beleeue aſſuredly, that my ſinnes are forgiuen in Chriſt, though I confeſſe them not to a ſinfull Prieſt, it may bee as bad, perhaps worſe than my ſelfe? I beleeue it will be found in good writers, that before the

            The 20. Article.
            Of the Authority of the Church.
            
               THe Church hath power to decree rites or Ceremonies, and authority in Controuerſies of faith: And yet it is not lawfull for the Church, to ordaine any thing that is contrary to Gods word; neither may it ſo expound one place of Scripture, that it bee repugnant to another. Wherefore, though the Church bee a witneſſe and a keeper of holy writ; yet it ought not to decree any thing againſt the ſame: ſo beſides the ſame it ought not to enforce any thing to bee beleeued, for neceſſity of ſaluation.
            
               This 20. Article explained and maintained by the Papiſts.
               IT is a true ſaying, of good vſe in opening of Controuerſies, that qui bene diſtinguit, bene docet. I will therefore for the better vnderſtanding of this point. Firſt, diſtinguiſh of Rites, Ceremonies, and Traditions. Secondly, propoſe certaine Theſes. Thirdly, confirme them according to the method which I haue confined my ſelfe vnto; either out of Papiſts, or out of old Manuſcripts.
               
               Of Traditions, Rites, and Ceremonies, as I take it from the Papiſts, ſome are diuine, appertaining to pietie, perpetuall and immutable.
               Some are humane, of the Tradition of the Church, for the better gouernment and policy of the ſame, which are variable and mutable, both in regard of time and of place.
               Thirdly, there are ſome infrugiferous, carnall, hypocriticall, or Phariſaicall, and theſe are neuer to be admitted, or being once admitted by conniuence of gouernours, or the induſtrie of the Deuill (that will if hee may, ſowe Tares amongſt Wheat) muſt be ſpeedily rooted out and abrogated.
               
                  
                  My Propoſitions are theſe.
                  1. DIuine Rites or Ceremonies, muſt bee taken out of the word of God, or the continuall ſucceſſion of the Church.
                  2. All Apoſtolicall Rites are not perpetuall.
                  3. Humane Rites and Ceremonies, may bee made by the Church according to the Scripture; are of like obſeruation, euen in things indifferent, if they be once ratified, till the Church doe abrogate them.
                  4. They muſt be thus conditioned. Firſt, not meerely offenſiue for their multitude. Secondly, myſterious for their ſignification. Thirdly, decent for the ornament of the Church. Fourthly, tending to piety, and not ſuperſtition. Fiftly, putting no affiance or confidence in them. Sixtly, not laſting, but Arbitrary, according vnto the times Countries and ſeaſons.
                  5. The Primitiue Churches had but a few.
                  6. All Iewiſh Ceremonies are aboliſhed.
                  7. Diuine Conſtitutions, are to bee preferred before humane inuentions, pure, and without mixture.
                  8. Humane Rites, muſt as neere as may bee, conſiſt in inward, and not externall matters, aſwell for the end, as for the thing.
                  9. If Ceremonies do offend, or otherwiſe be to bee abrogated, it is not for any priuate man to demoliſh them: but they muſt fairely and orderly be vnmade by the Authority of the Church, that firſt made them.
                  10. As they are to be ſeuerely puniſhed, that contemne the ſetled orders of the Church; ſo if there bee no contempt, we are not raſhly to cenſure them.

               I call them humane Rites and Ceremonies, becauſe they are inſtituted by men, for the good of men; but otherwiſe they are to bee obſerued with care and reuerence, though they be not directly contained, yet they are virtually to bee deducted out of the Scriptures; and it is not † Non cuivis permittatur vt eiuſmodi conſtitutiones violet: ſed ſi graues exiſterent mutand

               I Will take out of this Article as much as is in controuerſie betweene vs and the Papiſts.
            Tranſubſtantiation (or the change of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot bee prooued by Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plaine words of Scripture; ouerthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath giuen

occaſion to many ſuperſtitions. The body of Chriſt is giuen, taken, and eaten, in the holy Scripture, onely after an heauenly manner; and the meane whereby the body of Chriſt is receiued, and eaten in the Supper, is Faith, &c.
            
               The 28. Article maintained, and explained by the Papiſts.
               THe Papiſts in the Councel of Trent make it a Sacrifice both for the liuing and the dead. Admit it be a ſacrifice (which cannot bee well denied, being well vnderſtood;) yet

I conclude this point; Let him that hath a Biſhopricke attend his office, attend his function, attend his name; he is called a Biſhop, an Ouer-looker, or a Superintendant.

               I Haue touched the Popes free-hold, layed open the faults of their Cardinals and Biſhops; What remaineth? Nondum completae ſunt iniquitates Amorrhaeorum; but that in like manner, and that without any great order (which their vices will not beare) we proceed to ſpeake of the intollerable abuſes, and innumerable ſinnes of the Antichriſtian Romane Clergie, that we may haue a complete myſterie of iniquitie.
            
            
               Of the Prieſts.
               HEre for breuities ſake, let me intreat thee gentle Reader, whoſoeuer thou art, to name me any ſinne, wherein the Prieſt hath not bin Superlatiue. They are Prieſts with a witneſſe: before all other men, verum eſt, in ſinning. Will you haue ordinarie ſinnes, or extraordinary; prophane vices, or Clergie-faults? For me, it is all one, and it were well with them, if one were all: but I may number them vnto you almoſt by the dozens.

Neuizanus did long before I was borne, peraduenture, de Clerico ad aſinum valet argumentum, vnleſſe you would haue me tell you out of Polydor Virgil, that their Maſſe-Prieſts were ſo ignorant, as not to know whether Cle in Paracletus were long or ſhort. But for auoiding this difficultie, and helping their ignorant Shauelings, you haue lately found out an excellent deuice, to accent all the Triſſyllables, or longer words in your Miſſals: and yet I doe not remember, that Io. de Lapide, as very a ſtone as euer wrote, hath this amongſt his centum dubia occurrentia circa miſſam, printed and reprinted with ſhame enough. Thus endeth their firſt dozen of faults of their Prieſts, vnleſſe you will haue a Bakers dozen. I will bee loath for (for ſo was mine Author Gyraldus) to touch vpon this ſoare: it was not Sylueſter Gyraldus, and yet he was a plaine downe right Author; it is Lilius Greg. Cyraldus, the fault was this, (which I doe not ſcore vp, becauſe I giue it you to boote) That diuers men in his time, or of his knowledge, were choſen Priests

                  for ſome excellent qualitie, belike, becauſe they were excellent Stage-players: and yet when I bethinke my ſelfe the better, this may fall out to be no fault, or a ſmall one, when wee conſider, that it is the manner in Spaine and ſome Countries, to haue long Pulpits, and the firſt worke the Prieſt doth when he aſcends the Pulpet, is to ſet vp his Crucifixe, and then to play his parts, ſo as neuer an Actor of them all ſhall goe beyond him.

But in his time, and in all times, a man may find ſome of theſe Frogges; not only at Pharaohs Court, that is, in the Palaces of Kings and Princes; but in the Court of Rome, trading with his Holineſſe about making and marring of Marriages; about vnlawfull Diuorces and Diſpenſations, and I know not what. I will not ſpeake of their vnnaturalneſſe to Parents which they practiſe, if they doe not teach; nor of their children which they doe ſteale: I haue

               Of Miracles.
               I Had here thought to haue concluded: but that a fit and iuſt occaſion is giuen me, by a late accident that fell out here in Oxford, to ſpeake ſomewhat, although not much of this point, of Miracles: the patration of them is made a ſpeciall note of their Church in diuers bookes, that were lately ſcattered in the night about our Colledges and Halles, and in the Cities and fields (bookes that we haue heard of long ſince, whereof ſome of them are throughly refuted) becauſe I ſay, the euill one that hath ſowed theſe Tares amongſt our good Wheate, while the good Houſeholder ſlept (as his manner is) confides belikes in his cauſe, and triumphs vpon this point more then any other. I will therefore take ſo much paines, as to inſiſt vpon this point a little.
               I will not take vpon mee to anſwer all, it needeth not; let one or two ſerue for all the reſt. The Author of my Lord of Londons ſuppoſed Legacie, makes this his ſixth motiue: That true Miracles haue been wrought for proofe of the Catholike religion; but not any for Proteſtancy; and hee reckons vp diuers moſt ſtupendious Miracles in the primitiue Age, and later times; in this World and the New, I meane, both the Indies: and he concludeth with this Epiphonema; O miſery and feeblenes of Noueliſme in doctrine, which is forced
                  Pag. 75. 
                  (through it owne pouertie) to ſuſtentate and ſupport it ſelfe for the time, by maintaining aſſertions, repugnant to the prouidence and charitie of God towards Man, and to all light of naturall reaſon. So that we muſt (as my Lord of London did, if they could tell the time when) beleeue that doctrine which is accompanied with ſo many true and celebrious Miracles wrought by God alone, without any ſecondary humane meanes whatſoeuer. Maſter Io. Brereley hath likewiſe in his of S. Aug. religion ſpent his 18. Chapter, and all his Sections vpon this matter: ſo that now the matter is made cockſure. Againſt all which, is brought by him and his fellow Musket, whoſoeuer ſhall oppoſe his owne bare vnwarranted
                  
                  deniall, we leaue (ſaith hee) that man as much more worthy of contempt, then farther reply. But ſtay, now you Maſter Musket haue ſpent all your powder; or if you did ſhoote bullets, you haue wounded or killed none but your owne men (as may appeare.) Not to ſpeake of the Auctour vpon the vnperfect worke vpon Mathew, very ancient (although† In illud Mathei, Tunc qui ſent in Iudaea fugiant in montes. not Chryſoſtomes) whoſe words are ſo plaine for vs, both in the affirmatiue, that there is no note, note-worthy, or proofe of the true Church, niſi tantummodo per Scripturas: ſpoken more then once, or twice in the ſame place; and inSee my booke of Corruptions. the negatiue, that miracles may proue a falſe Church, and be done by Heretickes, which your Inquiſitors haue purged out of the Auctour: That miracles, ſtupendious miracles,† Io Bodinus methe do hiſt. p. 96.

                  Geo: Ʋenetus (to come neerer home) and they will bee able well to enſorme you in this point: and therefore ring your belles, preach your miracles, and make no ſmall gaine of them before them ſimple people or poore Indians. Let your men vrge them, and preſſe them, and make their ſtation in them, taking them vp of truſt one from the other, as Bede from S. Gregory, and S. Gregory from others. I am fully reſolued by your owne men, that miracles without faith can neuer be effectuall: but true faith without miracles, may bee acceptable both to God and men, as I haue formerly ſhewed.
               As concerning Maſter Brerelies fond obiection, becauſe I perceiue by the caſting away of his bookes, that hee is weary, or aſhamed of them; and is now caſting about, how he may frame a conuenient anſwer (though it bee but in ſhew) to him that wrote againſt him, I will not trouble his patience at this time, but ſtay till hee reioyne, and then I doe binde my ſelfe by promiſe, to ioyne iſſue with him, and to anſwer whatſoeuer hee ſhall obiect; either about miracles, or any thing elſe, that ſhall concerne the ſubſtance of our religion. Whilſt hee vrgeth Proteſtants and Papiſts, I will aſſure him that I will vrge none but Papiſts, and eſpecially thoſe that are marked with a black Theca in their Indices expurgatorij.
               
               And for a concluſion to all: ſeeing they vrge vs ſo farre vpon the point of miracles, I will commend theſe few miracles that follow to their moſt Chriſtian conſideration. If they proue not miracles, yet I beleeue, they will proue miraculous and ſtupendious actions, and ſuch as doe note forth vnto vs the great prouidence of God, in preſeruing his little flocke, his true Church, amidſt the furie, and fierie aſſaults of his and their great enemies, beyond the degree of admirations.
               
                  Firſt, when the deluge of ſuperſtition had wel-nigh ouer whelmed the arke of the Church, when that abomination of deſolation, foretold by Daniel, and foreſpoken by S. Paul, began to ſit in the Church, and to exalt himſelfe againſt God, or all that is called God: God had his Waldo in France, and Wickleph here in England, and Hus a little after in Behemia, that did preſerue the truth of religion intire and vncorrupted, and themſelues (except Iohn Hus) vntoucht and vnhurt: being but a handfull of men, againſt ſo many and potent Aduerſaries.
               Secondly, how their followers beeing perſecuted with bell, booke, and candle, with fire, and ſword, multiplied whilſt they groaned, like the Children of Iſrael vnder Pharaoh into thouſands, and ſtood out againſt the Pope and his Croiſadoes, and ſome of them to this preſent day, in the Conualles remaine, that neuer yet bowed the knees to Baal, nor receiued the marke of the Beaſt in their fore-heads.
               Thirdly, that blinde Ziska, and his poore Thaborits, ſhould conquer three hoſts of the Pontificians, that wereCochlaeus. thought to be iuincible, and to haue beene an armie ſufficient, to haue encountred the great Turke, and to haue beaten him out of all Natolia.
               
               Fourthly, that the ſlaughtering and murdering of men and women in their bloody vnholy Inquifition, hath bene a ſpeciall cauſe of the encreaſe of the Church, and the conuerſion of diuers Sauls into Pauls, which of bloody Inquiſitors, became afterwards patient Martyrs, to the aſtoniſhment of moſt men, who wondered not a little; that ſo many of both ſexes, eſpecially of the ſimpler ſort, ſhould lay down their liues ſo readily, for the teſtimony of the Goſpel: it made them (as I ſay) wonder, what that religion ſhould bee.
               Fiſtly, their Inquiſition of bookes aſwell as of men, the eſpeciall Ramme found out in the Councell of Trent, by the inſtigation of the Diuell, as the chiefe meanes to eſtabliſh their new and vnheard of religion; partly by prohibiting of whole bookes, partly by purging of ſome Tracts in ſome

bookes, hath proued (beeing diſcouered vnto vs by the finger of God) the chiefeſt inſtrument of Gods glory, whereby ſo many witneſſes of the truth are knowne now vnto vs; to ſpeake wholly, and often, and earneſtly, for the reformation which was made by Luther in theſe parts, (though it were before knowne in other parts of the world) eſpecially in Bohemia, that Luther himſelfe wiſhed both for doctrine and diſcipline, his might bee the ſame per omnia: I ſay in all this, men purpoſed, but God diſpoſed of all, for the ſingular good of his Church.
               Sixtly and laſtly, what ſhall I ſpeake of the more then miraculous preſeruation of the late Queene, and our late King, and of both King, Queene, Prince, and State, from infinite and eminent dangers, both from fire and water? in the Spaniſh inuaſion from water, in the Gunpowder treaſon from fire: God make vs euer more and more thankfull, for theſe our more then miraculous deliuerances, and ſo I end both the whole booke, and my anſwer to Musket and his companions about miracles. Deo ſoli ſit gloria.
               
            
         
         
            The Concluſion of the whole Booke, with certaine needfull Aduertiſements to the Chriſtian Reader, for the better vnderſtanding of the ſame.
            
               
                  CHriſtian Reader, whether Proteſtant or Papiſt, it mattreth not, and whether you reade & approue it, or reade and refuſe it, it is all one: there belongs ſubſcription to the one, and a full demonſtration of mine errours to the other: and then as I haue ready thankes for the one; ſo I haue as ready my peccaui for the other. In the meane time, now I haue put a full period to my booke, and eaſed both my ſelfe, and thee, of much faſtidiouſneſſe in reading, I thinke it fit to ſay ſomething,

and not much, for the clearing of my intentions, and your vnderſtandings.
            Firſt, for the teſtimonies cited, and recited in this booke, they are taken partly out of bookes printed, partly out of bookes vnprinted. Secondly, the bookes printed are partly (and for the greateſt part) of bookes purged; partly out of bookes vnpurged, whereof there be but very few: and whether purged, or vnpurged, the Authors all of them are putatiue, and ſuppoſed Papiſts, bred and brought vp in the boſome of the Catholique Romane Church: though they belong vnto the Catholique Church, as ſhall bee farther ſhewed in my Alphabet of Authors, and Prints in the latter end of the booke. Of theſe Authors that are vnpurged, I haue been very ſparing, when I could haue brought whole ſquadrons of Popiſh Writers that doe warre on our ſide, and fight vnder our colours. I haue ſingled out but three amongſt the reſt: the firſt is Geo. Wicelius: the ſecond, the Author of the Councell of Trent; the third and laſtPietro Seaue. is, Ant, de Dominis, all which I alleage the more willingly, becauſe all theſe three were either peace-makers, or reformers of thoſe Additaments, or ſuperadditaments, that time or ignorance, or that euill one hath brought in ſtep by ſtep into the Church of Rome: which was vnqueſtionably the Church of God, and its faith praiſed throughout all Nations, and is at this preſent time, a kind of putrid member of the ſame. The firſt of theſe is Geo. Wicelius, a famous preacher in his time of Mentz, who was a true peace-maker: the firſt after Martin Luther, whoſe Motto was, Beati Pacifici: and yet a ſore enemie to him, and all Sectaries, habemus confitentem reum. If Luther had not, hee and his accomplices would haue reformed the Church in a peaceable 
                  •
               anner, and in a lawfull Councell; and not otherwiſe in moſt things differenced, or controuerted betweene vs and the Papiſts. He firſt baniſheth the Schoolemen, and their nicities, and foole-queſtions, thinking them to be the only troublers of the State, and quiet of the Church.
            2. Secondly, in place of them, hee bringeth in the

Scripture, which he placeth in her Throne, as the Queene and Miſtreſſe of all other ſubordinate teſtimonies, giuing her the precedencie both in, and out of Councell, and making her, and her onely the ſupreme Iudge of all Controuerſies.
            3. He admits of no Traditions doctrinall, but ſuch as are well warranted by the Word of God: Ceremonials he alloweth vpon the ſelfe-ſame conditions that wee doe; if they be not too gaudy, or too many, ſignificatiue and myſterious, and well expounded to the people; for the ornament, not of the eſſence of the Church, without putting any truſt or confidence in them, a fault too common in thoſe dayes, and noted by Caſſander his Scholler many dayes and yeares after, and as yet vnreformed in their Romane Church.
            4. He is peremptorie for the Tranſlation of the Bible into the vulgar Languages of each Country, for ſinging of Pſalmes and Hymmes in a knowne tongue, and for Catechizing of the people.
            5. He inuayeth againſt their numberleſſe Feaſts, abuſed Vigils, and impoſed Faſts; the rigour of the one, and the number of the others, he thought fit to be abated, and in ſtead thereof, that Sermons ſhould be brought into the Church (if need were) two a day.
            6. For their Sermons, he would not haue them to be of a tale of a tub, or out of lying Legends, the principall fault of thoſe times, but out of the pure Word of God.
            7. He flatly contradicteth their adoration of Images.
            8. Their inuocation of Saints.
            9. He ſpeaketh againſt their confidence of Purgatorie, their queſtuarie oſtentation of Reliques, gainefull Funerals, and Di

               ges; and wiſheth, that the largeneſſe of the Popes Indulgences were contracted, and the Treaſure of the Church better imployed.

Hee inueyeth againſt their murmurings and whiſperings in their Liturgies, and wiſheth their halfe-Communions had either not been taken away; or being taken away, were reſtored againe in a Councell by publike authoritie, and not otherwiſe.
            11. He would haue a Councell called for reformation of the Church, in it Head and members: but his requeſt is the ſame with the Lutherans in the Councell of Trent, that the Emperour ſhould aſſemble it, the Word of God preſide in it, and that it ſhould be called in Idonea Ciuitate in a fit place, and the Pope to haue notice of it.
            12. Prieſts Marriage, though he like not well (as preferring ſingle life of Prieſts before it:) yet he knoweth no Canon of the Church, or tye of Vowes, to reſtraine them from marriage, warrantable enough by the Word of God, and practiſe of ſome Churches: but howſoeuer, he vtterly diſauoweth their Concubinarie Prieſts, their notorious Adulteries, Inceſts, and Fornications, eſpecially of the younger ſent: yea, hee is of the mind, that Prieſts Wiues and Children, ſhould haue ſome competencie of meanes allowed them for their liuelood and maintenance.
            13. What ſhall I ſay of their

               lergie? is not hee zealous for a Reformation, that ſpent his ſpirits almoſt and time wholly in vrging it, both in Pope, Cardinals, Biſhops, Prieſts, and Monkes, offendors more or leſſe, in what kind, and of what ſort ſoeuer?

            14. Laſtly, what ſhall I ſpeake of their Holy water, qua nihil immundius, that was vnholy, their Thurification, that was to be reiected, becauſe the ſent thereof was not pleaſing in Gods noſtrils, abuſe of Confeſſion, Baptiſme, Excommunication, which were too too much abuſed? You ſee our Wicelius was a true reformer of the Church, a moderate Papiſt at the leaſt, and no diſſembler of the faults of his age, & of the Church: doubtles in time he might (if he had not bin too much awed by their great ones, to whom as became a peaceable man he ſhewed all manner of outward obedience,) I ſay, he might haue prooued an other Martin Luther, though moued with a cleane cōtrary ſpirit, ſo powerful is the Spirit of God, to change our purpoſes, and alter our nature when, and as it pleaſeth the Diuine prouidence. Concerning, Ant. de Dom I know not well what to ſay: but to cry out Digitus Dei; God had a finger in diſpoſing of his comming ouer, and ſuffering him to fall, that other might riſe, and to write ſo directly againſt the Church of Rome (as to my ſeeming for the moſt points, no man hath done better,) though himſelfe were neuer in the right, hauing a good head, but a corrupt and equluocating heart from the beginning, which well became him that was tutored by, and brought vp vnder the Ieſuites. Now, albeit his

conuerſion were moſt fained, and his Apoſtacie moſt certaine and true, whatſoeuer he propoſed to himſelfe (the heart is a Cloſet, wherein none may enter but God,) God ſo diſpoſed of both for his glorie, that his perſon ſhould relapſe from our Religion, and himſelfe returne with the Dog to his old vomit, and his elegant and ſubſtantiall bookes (though they be mute) ſhould ſpeake and proclaime to all the World, the vnauoideable truth of our Religion, now publikely profeſſed and eſtabliſhed in the Church of England. Thus doth the diuine prouidence bring light out of darkneſſe, and make good effects ſpring from the roote of euill cauſes; as better ſhall appeare when we come to giue you my obſeruations about the bookes that are purged. I will onely touch vpon the Author of the Hiſtorie of the Councell of Trent, whom (becauſe Ant. de Dominis, whom I cannot call Ant. de Dommo, becauſe hee ſerued more Maſters, called Pietro Soare) I will alſo call him by that name, doth ſo farre ſhew to euery one-eyed Reader, that the Councell of Trent, though it were called againſt, and condemned Martin Luther, and his Religion; yet if the Councell had been free, and their voyces deciſiue without the Pope (though the Italian Biſhops were three to one in number) and there had been no foule play in calculating the voyces, ſtill I ſay, leauing the Clokebag behind, the Councell of Trent might haue turned Lutheran, and ſate at Witenberge, aſwell as there, for their propoſitions and reaſons, which (as D. Stapleton ſaith) may be fallible and deceitfull; but the concluſion is that which they did, and we muſt look after, if we will ſuffer our ſelues to be hoodwinckt,
                  See l, Examen Pacifique. Que le Concile of eſt pas legitime. Chap. 4. and as very fooles as they; I am not ignorant, that there be ſome in the world moderate Papiſts, that haue taken as iuſt, and as great exception, as we doe, or can, vnto the Councell of Trent; and I would not haue the Chriſtian Reader ignorant of this, that I haue intreated of this largely in another ſet Treatiſe, which, if it ſhall be thought worthy by the Church of England (to whom I doe yeeld, and owe all ſubmiſſion) may haue the happineſſe with ſome

other Treatiſes of mine to ſee the light. Of the bookes printed vnpurged, ſo much by way of caueat: for the printed purge ▪ Copies, take gentle Reader, theſe few notes into thy Chriſtian conſideration.
            1. That I propoſe not to my ſelfe any exact handling of the Controuerſies queſtioned betweene vs and the Papiſts, per viam Thomae (as they ſay) by way of oppoſition, or obiections and anſweres out of Scripture, Councels, Fathers, midled aged, firſt aged, and all aged Writers before Martin Luther: my weake and wearied legges at this time will not ſuffer me to expatiate ſo farre; (yet my ſtudies I confeſſe, and naturall diſpoſition to rip vp, and vnfold the controuerſies, and vnriuit them out of the ſecrets of true Antiquitie, driue that way) my purpoſe is (if God will) to giue you a taſte onely of that fruit, which may be expected out of their ſundry Indices Expurgatorij, if they be well and narrowly ſought after, and looked into. I haue but ſeuen or eight of them; ſome that fell into my hands by caſualty, at the ſurprizall of the Towne of Cadiz; others, by the prouidence of God, and great care and induſtrie of the Founder of our great Librarie, Sir Thom.

               ges, and wonderfull preſeruer of bookes. I haue by my ſelfe and my friends, amaſſed and ſhouelled together ſome thirtie Quire of Paper of Catholike reſtitutions, and reſtored ſome one or two hundred ſeuerall Authors, and out of them I haue gathered this ſmall Introduction, or Manuduction vnto Diuinitie, ſorted according vnto the eſpeciall Articles of Religion, controuerted at this day betweene vs and the Papiſts▪ deliuered in as plaine and familiar manner, as I could poſſibly deuiſe, for the capacitie of the vulgar Proteſtant or Papiſt.
            2. I haue not taken all that may be taken, or gathered out of the Articles, that the booke might not riſe to too great a bulke. I haue neither collected all that is contained in the ſeuerall Indices, but a third or fourth part only; nor all that is contained in my ſaid collections, but the moſt pertinent and proper places.
            
               3. Neither is it to be vnderſtood▪ that all that are recorded by them for Papiſts, are indeed Papiſts, but ſuppoſed ones, as Laeuinus, Lemnius, Io. Spondanus, &c. whoſe teſtimonies are ſparingly miſcited by mee, in following the common errour of the Pontificians, which reckon them in the ſecond Claſſis of Authors prohibited, which is the note of Papiſts bookes forbidden: but whether they be, or bee not, the queſtion is prooued without their teſtimonies, which you may take, or follow at pleaſure.

which vncoacted, and forced by truth, doe pleade for our Religion, are pertinent and to the purpoſe: for elſe what need had you to raze the Records, and as it were, to embezell their Writings?
            8. To ſay (as ſome doe) that our Mother the Church may correct her diſobedient children, and reduce them into the right way of truth, when they reclaime, or ſwarue from the truth, may, perhaps, be true, prouided, that it bee knowne which is the true Church: ſecondly, that it haue a certaine infallible and inerrable rule, whereby all doctrine muſt be ſquared: and laſtly, that the Author bee ſent for by himſelfe, or his friends, his errour ſhewed, and reaſons conuicted. But for the firſt, you haue no Church; if you haue, lay the Pope aſide, whom you would faine make your inerrable Dictator, and tell me where it is, and who it is, and wee ſhall haue ſome hope of agreement in this point. Secondly, as you haue no Church, ſo you haue no certaine Rule to proceed by, your doctrine is yet to ſeek, & your Religion to be made, except tranſubſtantiation, your doctrine againſt Prieſts Marriage, & ſome few points more, that are in ſome ſort, in ſome Councels concluded; ſhew all points of your doctrine, your additaments, determined before the Councel of Trent, & you ſhal haue them for me. As for the

Laſtly, that which you practiſe vpon your owne Writers by way of expurgatiō, is not done with their priritie, but altogether againſt their wils and conſents.
            9. It will not auaile the Papiſts to ſay, that they purge not the words of the Text in any Romiſh-Catholike Author, but ſome ſcattred Annotations in the Margent or Indices of ſome Writers. I reply, that the Indices and Margents ſpeake nothing different from the text, and whether the Text be not thorowly expunged, and ſome whole ſentences, pages, yea, ſixtie in follio together blotted out; I referre my ſelfe to any indifferent Popiſh Arbiter▪ to arbitrate and ſentence this controuerſie betweene vs: for being reduced

But you cry out ſtill, Shew vs the bookes printed accordingly, as Auentinus, Cranzius, Ferus, Eſpencaeus, or Stella? Let me ſee whether the ſentences you ſpeake of, or thoſe that you haue produced in this very booke, be omitted or no? I anſwere: This obiection hath a good varniſh or glaſſe ſet vpon it; but glaſſe is brittle, and varniſh will not long hold: to ſay the truth, your men ſpeak they know not what in defence of their Indices; you haue their toungs, and they haue your eares to pawne, and which is more, your ſoules and conſciences. What you heare your ſpirituall Gouernours ſay, you beleeue aſſuredly: what ſo you beleeue, you are ready to depoſe (if need be) againſt your conſciences. For example: If one of your ſpirituall fathers ſhould tell you, that the houſe at the Blacke-Friers fell vpon a Puritane Preacher and his Pſalming Auditorie, to
                  The houſe was ſaid

Doubtleſſe he is a Ieſuite, ergo, impeccable, or a Father of the Societie, and therfore to be beleeued, chiefely in ordine ad Deum. Or what if another of the ſame Societie ſhould bring you a booke of my Lord of Londons Legacy, (a Legacy without a Will; or a Will, but neuer prooued) how gladly would you reade and receiue, hugge and embrace it, as the words of a dying Saul, ſo lately, ſo miraculouſly conuerted to the Romane Faith? Yet Preſton, that is ſaid to be his conuerter, denieth it, & ſaith plainly in Peters word, but with more truth, I know not the man: his eldeſt ſon that was with him, & his Chaplains & ſeruants that were about him▪ know no ſuch things. Let other mē coniecture what they will of this rumour, if I might freely deliuer vnto you my conceite, this falſe report was hatched firſt in the Spaniſh Embaſſadours houſe, by him is was rumoured abroad beyond the Seas, and by him and his it was bruted here in England: I haue my reaſons to thinke it and thinke it againe; for that about the ſame time, there was a booke

But admit it be ſo as our Aduer ſaries would haue it: although (as I haue ſaide before) it is voyced publiquely by many, and thoſe moſt graue and ſubſtantall perſons to the contrary, that all was but apolitique inuention of the State, and a ſnare to intrap them ſilly ſonles, whereby it may appeare, that thoſe which ſhould haue put this treaſon in execution, were the Authors and plotters of it. Here are the ſame words twice repeated: note them well, and call to minde that if this Treaſon, which God did miraculouſly preuent and confound, had (quod ab ſit) taken effect, it ſhould haue beene bruted and rumored abroad, that this had bene the fact of the Puritants, to ſet the Puritants and the Proteſtants together by the eares, and whilſt they had beene ſheathing their ſwordes one in anothers bowels, the Spaniards might haue come in and cut all their throates. Heere hence I draw a double obſeruaaion, one of the wily Spaniard, who knowing that his Maieſtie, and the State, was iuſtly incenſed againſt the Puritants, caſt all the enuie they can vpon them: the fall of the Houſe in the black Friars, was vpon Puritants; the King was, or ſhould haue bene depoſed by the Puritants; the powder Treaſon ſhould haue bene wrought and brought to paſſe by Proteſtant Puritants. The other obſeruation is this, that there is no report ſo helliſh, diuelliſh, or incredible; but a Romaniſt, or Hiſpaniolized Papiſt, will ſoone beleeue it if it bee told him in ordine ad Deum, or to make the King of Spaine their Maſter, Maſter of the Land, in whoſe pay as itBrittanniae populos quos Pater,

This is plainly manifeſted both out of the paine contained in the Indices, and out of the bookes themſelues that come vnto vs by diuine prouidence; eſpecially from the Colledge of Cadiz. After this manner Did. Stella, Io. Ferus, Guil. Budaeus, remaine to this day in the publique Library, ſome whole leaues paſted together, the ſentences blotted, and the bookes tormented in a pittifull manner, that it would grieue any mans heart to ſee them; and this was done by publique Authority, according to the preſcript forme of your Expurgatorie Indices, the Inquiſitors name is either fore ſcribed, or ſubſcribed, to euery booke. It were a world to ſee Krantzius, and Auentine, as they come out of their hands. There are ſome a priuate perſons in Oxford, that haue bookes in like ſort expunged and ſigued with the Inquiſitors hands. What might the number bee of all thoſe thinke wee, that came out of that Colledge? It is no maruell then if Maſſarena the Biſhop, or any other, offered ſuch large ſummes, for to haue had the bookes againe; they feared belike, that their knauery would come forth, and the myſtery bee vnfolded of this worke of darkeneſſe, which ſince that time hath lyen

Saint Iohn Chryſoſtome, Agapetus, and diuers others, either in their owne workes, or in other mens workes, of great Antiquitie purged, and repurged, and expurged againe. What your purpoſe is, I know not, I do eaſyly imagine that it is to no great good of our religion, that you haue fiue times at the leaſt printed ſeuerall Editions of the Bibliotheca Sanctorum Patrum: firſt printed by Bigne, and lately at Coleyne with additions of I know not how many volumes, with Ieſuiticall notes and Annotations, in Greeke and Latine; and ſo much for this ninth obſeruation, which I haue the rather inſiſted vpon ſo long, becauſe it containeth the marrow and pith of all the reſt.
            10. Theſe men that beare witneſſe for vs, are no meane Fellowes, abiect Writers, or contemptible perſons; but the glory of thoſe dayes, the honour of thoſe times, the great Lampes and Ornaments of their Romiſh Church, ſome of them Inquiſitors, but grone now vnder the Inquiſition themſelues; quis enim cuſtodiat ipſos cuſtodes: but as I haue elſewhere (and may hereafter more fully) ſhewed, there is no more certaintie in their cenſures, then there is aſſuredneſſe in their religion, which is iuſt none at all. But briefely and orderly, that you may know of what great account they were, at the latter end of this booke, you ſhall perhaps haue an Alphabeticall Table, that out of their own cenſures, ſhall demonſtrate this point to the full.
            Laſtly, you ſee by theſe Indices, if fleſh and blood might haue preuailed, by the ſecret operation of the Deuill, how

the Pontificians would haue taken from vs, and the World, ſo many teſtimonies of Fathers, middle aged Writers, and of all ſorts, all at one time, and as it were, blowne them vp like Fa

But God hath blowne, as it were, the Powder into their owne faces, filling them with ſhame and confuſion, laying their nakedneſſe open to the eye of the World, inſomuch, that all wel-minded men doe either hiſſe, or laugh at it; ſeeing our Religion reaſonably well confirmed and eſtabliſhed by their owne men. What pittie had it been, that ſo many Noble Writers, and worthy Authors ſhould haue periſhed from vs and them. And thereby any man of the meaneſt capacitie may thence draw forth this concluſion, that God had his Church in the middeſt of Poperie, and ſpeciall men, that in euery age did reclaime and declaime againſt their foule abuſes, both in doctrine and life. Theſe are the knees that neuer bowed to Baal, the men that truly ſerued God (though it were in ſecret) which if they had been free to ſpeake their minds, and their minds had been fully knowne to vs, they would moſt willingly haue imbraced our Religion, and made a greater reformation, then that of Luthers, and that of the Princes of Germanie, which was by the ſecret IudgementHildegardis. of God, to be performed in ore gladij cruentati, as was long prophecied before.

By that time we haue gone ouer all the vnprinted Manuſcript Copies in both Vniuerſities, the famous Librarie of Sir Robert Cotton, and other priuate Libraries, is there not great hope of much good to bee done for the publike benefit of the Church?

                     leane contrary to the Kings Supremacy, I know not how it can be defended. Againe, of the points preſſed in the Oath, ſome are crved downe by all, as Indulgences, ſome denied by almoſt all, as adoration of Images: ſome doubted of by their beſt learned, as Purgatorie: ſome held with a diſtinction, as that of the ſeuen Sacraments: and yet the ſimple Papiſts muſt ſweare to them all, and that no man can be ſaued without holding them all. begotten Sonne of God, and borne of the Father before all Worlds; God of God, Light of Light, true God of true God; begotten, not made, of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father, by whom all things were made; who, for vs Men, and for our ſaluation, came downe from Heauen, and was incarnate by the holy Ghoſt of the Ʋirgin Marie, and was made Man: was crucified for vs vnder Pontius Pilate; ſuffered, and was buried; and roſe againe the third day according to the Scriptures, and aſcended vp into Heauen; ſitteth at the right hand of the Father; and he ſhall come againe with glory, to iudge both the Liue and the Dead; of whoſe Kingdome there ſhall bee no end. And in the holy Ghoſt, our Lord and giuer of life, who proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne; who with the Father and the Sonne, is together adored and conglorified, who ſpake by the Prophets: And one holy Catholique and Apoſtolike Church. I confeſſe one Baptiſme for the remiſſion of

ſinnes; and I expect the reſurrection of the Dead, and the Life of the World to come. Amen.
               I doe moſt ſtedfaſtly admit and embrace the Traditions of the Apoſtles, and of the Church, and all other obſeruances and Conſtitutions of the ſame Church. I doe likewiſe admit the holy Scripture, according to that ſenſe, which our holy Mother the Catholike Church hath holden, and doth hold, vnto whom it doth appertaine to iudge of the true ſenſe, and interpretation of the holy Scriptures; neither will I euer vnderſtand, nor interpret the ſame otherwiſe, then according to the vniforme conſent of the Fathers.
               I doe alſo profeſſe, that there be truly and properly ſeuen Sacraments of the new Law, inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, and neceſſarie for the ſaluation of Mankind (although they be not neceſſarie for all men,) to wit, Baptiſme, Confirmation, Euchariſte, Penance, Extreme Ʋnction, Order, and Matrimony; and that theſe Sacraments doe giue Grece; and that of them, Baptiſme, Confirmation, and Order, cannot bee reiterated without Sacriledge. I doe alſo receiue, and admit all the receiued and approoued Ceremonies of the Catholike Church, in the ſolemne adminiſtration of all the aforeſaid Sacraments. I doe embrace and receiue all, and euery of thoſe things, which in the holy Councell of Trent haue been defined, and declared, touching Originall ſinne and Iuſtification. I doe profeſſe alſo, that in the Maſſe is offered vnto God, a true, proper, and propitiatorie Sacrifice for the Liue and Dead; and that in the moſt holy Sacrament of the Altar, there is truly, really, and ſubſtantially, the body and blood, together with the Soule and Diuinitie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; and that there is made a Conuerſion of the whole ſubſtance of Wine into the Blood; which Conuerſion, the Catholique Church doth call Tranſubſtantiation. I doe alſo confeſſe, that vnder either kind onely, is receiued Chriſt, whole, intire, and the true Sacrament.
               I doe conſtantly hold, that there is Purgatorie; and that the ſoules which be there detained, are holpen by their Prayers of the faithfull. Alſo, that the Saints, who reigne together

with Chriſt, are to bee worſhipped, and called vpon, and that they offer vp prayers to God for vs, and that their Reliques are to be worſhipped. I doe moſt ſtedfaſtly affirme, that the Images of Chriſt, of the Mother of God alwaies Virgin, and of other Saints, are to bee had and receiued, and that due honour and reuerence is to be giuen to them. I doe affirme, that the authority of Indulgences, was left by Chriſt in the Church, and that the vſe of them is very behoofefull for Chriſtian people. I doe acknowledge the holy Catholique and Apoſtolique Romane Church, to be the Mother and Miſtreſſe of all Churches, and doe promiſe and ſweare true obedience to the Biſhop of Rome, who is the Succeſſour of Saint Peter Prince of the Apoſtles, and the Ʋicar of Ieſus Chriſt. All other things defined and declared by the holy Canons and Oecumenical Councels, and chiefly by the holy Councell of Trent, I do vndoubtedly receiue and profeſſe. And alſo all contrary things, and whatſoeuer hereſies condemned, reiected, and accurſed by the Church, I likewiſe doe condemne, reiect and accurſe.
               This true Catholique Faith, without which no man can be ſaued, which now I doe willingly profeſſe and hold, I the ſame I. N. doe promiſe, vow, and ſweare to hold, and confeſſe moſt conſtantly, by Gods helpe, intire, and vncorrupted, euen to the laſt end of my life; and to procure, as much as ſhall lye in me
