               YOu sent to me to borrow twenty marke,
               But to that suite by no meanes would I harke,
               Then presently you sent a man in post,
               To tell me that a Lord with you would host:
               And you must haue to entertaine his state,
               A Siluer Bason with some other plate,
               Are you a cockscombe? or thinke me a foole?
